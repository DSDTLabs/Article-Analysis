PATNA: Poor visibility due to fog affected several flights at the Patna airport on Thursday morning though officials claimed none of the flights was cancelled or diverted.

 With the visibility as low as 200metres till 10.30am, airlines were asked not to operate Patna-bound flights without clearance from the   unit at Patna. Owing to the short length of runway at the city airport, flights are allowed to operate only when the minimum visibility is at least 1200metres.
 
 The airport officials heaved a sigh of relief when the meteorological watch office on the airport premises reported visibility up to 1200metres at 1.17pm. Subsequently, GoAir’s   from Delhi was the first to land at Patna, followed by an   flight of the same route.
 
 “None of the flights was either cancelled or diverted,” Patna airport director Rajendra Singh Lahauria told TOI on Thursday evening.
 
 Sources said Air India’s   flight AI- 409, which was scheduled to land at 12 noon, was delayed by over 90 minutes. Similarly, GoAir’s G8-149 flight on the route was delayed by 95 minutes. Jet Airways’ Patna-Mumbai flight 9W-333 was delayed by over three hours.
 
 Altogether 27 flights land at Patna and an equal number of flights take off from the city these days as per the winter schedule which remains effective from December 1 to February 15.
