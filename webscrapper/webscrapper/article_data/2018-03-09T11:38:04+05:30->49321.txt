PANAJI: Speaking out on the decision of the   to cancel 88 iron ore mining leases in Goa, JSW Steel’s chairman and managing director, Sajjan  , urged chief minister Manohar Parrikar to respect the verdict.

 Lauding the Supreme Court’s landmark order, which will effectively render Goa’s iron ore mining industry non-operational from March 15, Jindal said auctioning of iron ore mining leases would benefit the state.
 
 “Mine auctions through a transparent process will give additional revenue to the Goa exchequer. Delaying the act won’t help anyone,” Jindal said in a tweet.
 
 He also seemed to unhappy with recent attempts made by legislators from Goa who travelled to New Delhi to try and convince the Narendra Modi-led government to permit mining operations to continue in the state through an ordinance. 
 
 An all-party delegation from Goa, led by PWD minister and MGP leader Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar, met Union minister for shipping Nitin Gadkari in New Delhi and pleaded that the central government to find ways to resume mining in Goa. The delegation included legislators from   as well as   party.
 
 “Instead of putting pressure on Delhi, it will be much better to respect (the) Hon. Supreme Court judgement. Goa CM must act on time based auction of the mines,” Jindal said in his tweet.
