NAVI MUMBAI: Vashi resident Neha Budhraja thought her severe   was the sign of a problem with her spine. However, specialists told her the ache was due to the wrong kind of footwear she had been using. 

 With increasing number of women complaining about back pain, orthopaedics have been asking patients to say no to flat shoes and go for heels. 
 
 However, doctors warned heels created stress on the toe area, giving rise to pain in thefoot, heel, calf and eventually the back. 
 
 Flat shoes should be flexible and comfortable. Hard soles cause heel and toe pain and these can be avoided if the pair is soft and cushioned. Doctors say women don’t realise that most of these aches are caused by wearing the wrong kind of shoes.
 
 Consulting orthopaedic surgeon Dr   said, “The number of women visiting doctors for foot and toe ailments have increased by 75% in the past two years. On a daily basis, there are three to four patients with such complaints and they are due to wearing the wrong kind of footwear. 
 
 It has been found that high heels cause the knee to bend when the foot hits the ground. “This puts a lot of strain on the knee joint especially if the woman is overweight. Prolonged wearing of high heels can trigger stress fractures and trapped nerves,” Dr Badiyani said. 
 
 Doctors say women who wear high heels often suffer from the shortening of the Achilles tendon because once the heel is pointed upwards it tightens up. “Wearing 3.5 inch heels or more can lead to prematurely aged joints and increases a women’s risk of developing arthritis,” he said.
 
 Consulting orthopaedic surgeon Dr Siddhart Yadav said footwear should be made of an absorbing material and should have at least a one inch heel. “Stiff, hard and flat shoes can cause abnormal stress and  ,” he added.
