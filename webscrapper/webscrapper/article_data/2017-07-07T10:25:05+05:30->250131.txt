KOLKATA: Fresh tension was reported in  's Basirhat area on Thursday forcing the police to lob tear gas shells and resort to baton charge even as the state government decided to ban some organisations for allegedly instigating people. 

 "There may be reports of small incidents, but the situation is under control," a senior official at the state secretariat asserted. "Fresh tension brewed at Basirhat town and station area after the communal clashes in Baduria in the district," a senior cop said. Police and BSF personnel rushed to the area to bring the situation under control, he said. 
 
 Bengal BJP described West Bengal governor   as a "dedicated soldier" of PM Modi's brigade. "TMC thinks bad-mouthing the governor would bottle him up. But they are mistaken. He is a dedicated soldier of the 'Modi Vahini'. So, he will keep walking the path of truth," BJP's national general secretary Rahul Sinha told reporters here. 
 
 TMC minister   said such statements only confirmed the truth of Trinamool's allegation of the governor's close affinity with the BJP. "Today, the cat is out of the bag. We have been saying for the last few days that the Governor's house has been transformed into a BJP office," he added.
