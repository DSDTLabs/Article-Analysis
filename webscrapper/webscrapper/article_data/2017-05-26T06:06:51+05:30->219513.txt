KOCHI: A new public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed before the Kerala high court seeking a court declaration that the quarries and other industrial units functioning at   are unauthorized.

 Considering the PIL filed by   of   near Nemom in Thiruvananthapuram during admission hearing, the court has asked the state government to inform its views, including policy on granting licence renewals for quarries.
 
 According to the petition, Mookkunnimala is a reserve forest that extended to 524.5 acres. In 1961, 425.5 acres of the reserve forest was assigned for rubber cultivation on the condition that the land should not be used for any other purpose. While the Forest Conversation Act of 1980 requires prior approval of the central government for any non-forest activity, many leases for quarrying were issued by the state government even after the law came into being. Since 2008, quarry mafia has purchased the assigned lands and have extended their activities.
 
  Seven metal crusher units and six m-sand units are working there without any legal sanction in violation of provisions of Forest Conservation Act, Mines and Minerals Act, and the special rules regarding rubber cultivation, it is alleged.
 
 It is pointed out by the petitioner that a division bench of the HC had said in a 2009 judgment regarding quarrying in land leased for rubber cultivation at Mookkunnimala that land cannot be put to any other use other than the specific purpose for which it was assigned.
 
 The petitioner is seeking a court declaration that all the leases and licences of quarries, crusher unit, or any other industrial units working within the area allotted for rubber cultivation and in Mookkunnimala reserve forest is absolutely unauthorized. A directive to the state government to stop the operations of all industrial units in Mookkunnimala and in adjacent areas allotted for rubber cultivation is also sought by the petitioner.
