HYDERABAD:   committee president N   Reddy, on Tuesday appealed to Scheduled Tribes to send "KCR and his family" to their home and bring the   party to power. He extended an assurance that the party will extend reservations to STs in proportionate to population in Telangana. 

 Addressing a gathering, as part of 'Girijana Sadassu' at Kamareddy, the TPCC president announced the "ST declaration" as part of which he listed out the welfare measures and sops the Congress would implement for tribals, upon coming to power, in 2019.
 
 Uttam said KCR cheated the STs on reservations. "STs trusted KCR and voted for him but he failed to fulfil his promise of 12 per cent reservations to Scheduled Tribes," he said.
 
 Stating that the Congress party will be committed to its ST declaration, Uttam said they will fill all vacancies and would also set up a tribal university and start works on Bayyaram Steel Factory.
 
 The TPCC chief said the Congress party, if voted to power, will waive off 2 lakh crop loan. The ITDAs would also be set up in plain areas and minimum support price would be offered to every agriculture produce of farmers. The Congress will give 3,000 unemployment allowance until youth are provided jobs, Uttam said. 
 
 He alleged that the suppression of tribals has increased in the TRS rule and charged the KCR-government with handcuffing tribal farmers for seeking remunerative prices for their produce.
 
 Exuding confidence that the Congress will win over 80 of the 119 Assembly constituencies in Telangana, Uttam said the proposed federal front of KCR was to divert the attention of voters from their failures.
