BIJNOR: Acting on a tip-off that controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik’s books were on the syllabus of a privately-run government-recognized school in   village of Bijnor, Bijnor’s basic shiksha adhikari sent a team and found the allegations to be “correct”. A notice has now been served to the school’s owner. Naik is facing multi-agency probe ever since   said that Naik’s sermons had triggered terror attack in Dhaka in July 2016.

 BSA   said, “On Friday, a team led by block education officer Shiv Kumar was sent to the village and found that a book named ‘Ilm Un Nafe’ was being taught to the kids of Class II. However, no copy of the book was found in the school. Later, the probe team questioned the owner of the school. He said that a book was being taught to the students of class II in which there was a chapter on Naik. But when he came to know about the row, he withdrew the book.”
