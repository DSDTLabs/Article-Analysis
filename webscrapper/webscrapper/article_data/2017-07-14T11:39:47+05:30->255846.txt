The lotus leaf is an incredible example of nature’s ingenuity. It is well known that water doesn’t collect on the surface of the leaves, thus preventing them from rotting. This phenomenon has even inspired scientists to treat the inner surface of shampoo bottles with a substance that mimics the lotus leaf, therefore allowing the shampoo to slide off the surface of the bottle. In the human body, when certain cells get clustered and stuck inside arteries, it leads to blockages which may result in   or stroke. Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a drug that prevented blockages by not allowing these cells to accumulate in the blood vessels?

 Scientists at the   have identified a potential drug target, PAI-039, which does not allow cells from the blood vessels to move around, thereby reducing the formation of blockages. The drug works by inhibiting plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, or PAI-1, which is a protein found inside blood vessels, and which controls cell movements. When a person has diabetes or is obese, PAI-1 is produced in large quantities inside the arteries, which in turn allows cells to accumulate and form blockages. Researchers found that PAI-039 prevented the movement of the cells that form blockages in the arteries, and reduced the formation of blockages by nearly 50%. These studies were done in cultured human cells as well as in mice cells. Researchers feel that PAI-39 may also result in  , which could potentially decrease the formation of blood clots, the main culprit for heart attacks and strokes. Further studies need to be conducted before this drug is approved for use in humans. The results of this study do, however, suggest that a PAI-1 inhibitor may be considered in combination with other treatment regimens to help prevent heart disease in people at risk.
 
 This just proves that we can find inspiration anywhere, even in the humble lotus leaf.
