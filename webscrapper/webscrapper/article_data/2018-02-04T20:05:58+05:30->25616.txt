Singer   is trying to ensure that she puts her best foot forward for her performance of the US national anthem at the   in Minneapolis, despite suffering from flu.

  
  
 Reportedly, the 38-year-old revealed about the flu via an   post.
 
  
  
 "Trying to practice the flu away," she captioned a photograph in which she is seen during rehearsals.
 
 Pink said her six and a half year old daughter   and 13-month-old son   were to blame for her sickness.
 
 "I've been waiting to sing this song since 1991 when I saw my idol,  , own this song. And now, my chance has finally come. And it just so happens that this chance comes when I have two small Petri dish kids who literally cough into my mouth and rub their snot on my cheek. You can't write this stuff I swear!
 
 
  
 
 "And here we are. I've arrived at another one of my dreams which is slowly becoming a sort of nightmare. I will tell you, this is one of the biggest honours of my life, singing this song in front of my family, my military family, my dad and brother and step mama and family and the world. And the Eagles. I promise I will do my best, as I always do."
 
 She does not hold a grudge against the children.
 
 "You can cough at me for the rest of your lives," she said, adding: "If it's a contest, babies, you win. #spreadthelove #spreadthegerms #pleasegivememyvoiceback #ificansingimgonnakillit."
