HYDERABAD: Fines are no deterrent for many in the city seen using tinted glass without ample visibility and black sun films on their cars, in clear violation of the   and the   ruling of 2012.

 With soaring temperatures, tinted glass and black sun films are back in demand, say car dealers. As per laws, the use of black sun films is banned. However, tinted glass can be used, provided that the windscreen and rear window glass have a visibility of at least 70% and the side windows have a visibility of at least 50%. Several car owners in the city pointed to the paltry fine as one of the major reasons for non-compliance.
 
  
  
 
 “If caught in violation of the rules, one can get away by paying a fine ranging from ?100 to ?500 and removing the black film thereafter. Using protective film over the side windows and the rear window has become essential during summers and there are ample number of shops selling these black films and tinted glass in Hyderabad,” said a car owner on condition of anonymity.
 
 According to road safety experts, lack of stricter enforcement is the primary reason for non-compliance with the ban.
 
 “Due to stricter enforcement that was carried out initially, the percentage of vehicles with black films have come down in the city, compared to five or six years ago. People opt for black films during summers since it is a more cost-effective option when compared with tinted glass that offer more visibility,” said  , CEO of the Indian Federation of Road Safety (IFROS).
 
 Figures available with the traffic cops show how while enforcement was strengthened in 2016, the number of cases booked dipped in 2017. While 914 cases of violation of the tinted glass and black film rule were booked in 2015, this number jumped to 1,452 in 2016, thus showing a 58.9% jump. For all of 2017, only 562 cases were booked, thus showing a 61% dip—shows data
