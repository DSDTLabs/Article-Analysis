ROHTAK: Prime Minister   will unveil the 56-foot-tall metal statue of peasant leader Sir Chhotu Ram at his birthplace Garhi   in   later this year. Famed sculptor and recipient of Padma Bhushan Ram V Suthar has been engaged for the project.

 Amit Kajal, district president of Chhotu Ram Vichar Manch, told TOI that nearly 7.5 tonnes of iron was collected from across Haryana to build the statue to be installed at the Chhotu Ram museum in Sampla. This would replace the earlier smaller structure of the leader installed there in and would also be visible from a distance. Amit said the foundation measuring 22-feet had already been built and the installation part would be completed soon.
 
 He said a five-member committee was entrusted with the responsibility to oversee the technicalities involved in erecting the Rs 2 crore-statue. “A committee of seven members has been formed to deal with the visit of the PM. Further, a marble plinth with names of the donors, their villages and amount donated will be placed near the memorial,” added Amit.
 
 Meanwhile, Union steel minister Birender Singh, who is grandson of Chhotu Ram, held a meeting of the Chottu Ram Trust and informed that the event would be attended by large number of people from across Haryana and outside and it would remain apolitical. Singh’s wife and Uchana MLA Prem Lata is the chairperson of the Trust.
