MUMBAI: Hours after scores of families had a lucky escape as a part of their three-storey Jer Mahal building near Kalbadevi collapsed on Saturday, Mhada evacuated the cessed structure for repair. The residents fear they may not be able to return to their homes any time soon, and blamed the slab collapse on construction of the underground Colaba-Seepz Metro-3 nearby.

 
 On April 11,   gave a notice to the building: “To ensure the safety and stability of all the structures in and around the alignment, a pre and post construction survey and the monitoring of your building will be undertaken as a part of our construction protocol.” Asked about this, an MMRC spokesperson said, “A survey was done in September 2017 and based on the building’s condition, it was categorised as severe. Recent notice could be served to only one or two units which could have been left out from the survey due to unavailability of the owner.” The spokesperson added, “Our nearest worksite of tunnelling or station construction is far away... No tunneling work has taken place since April19 and all standard safety protocols are followed. The work has no relation with the incident.”
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Anand Bobde, who ran out his second floor home with family around 3 am on Saturday due to vibration, said, “We were feeling the vibrations for the last few days. I even called   officials informing about it two days before the incident. But no one visited the building.” Local resident and   vibhag-pramukh   said, “The incident created panic among residents of the congested area. It is the MMRC’s responsibility to take care of all the buildings in the dangerous zone of the tunnel, to avoid any serious incident.”
