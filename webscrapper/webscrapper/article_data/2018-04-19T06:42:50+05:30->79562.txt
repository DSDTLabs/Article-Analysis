Lucknow: Facing flak for mishandling the alleged Unnao rape case, the UP government has decided to send a proposal to the Centre seeking a provision to award death penalty to rapists in cases of assault on minors.

 Earlier, J&K chief minister   and Union minister   had proposed a law to make death penalty mandatory for those who violate minors. MP, Rajasthan, Haryana and   have already passed bills in their respective state assemblies to award death penalties in similar crimes. 
 
 Delhi CM   too has announced his plan to introduce death penalty for rapists of minor girls. CM   tweeted that the government was sending the proposal to the Centre for an amendment in the law for the purpose.
 
  Holding a review meet with top administrative and police officials earlier on Wednesday, the CM asked officials to step up efforts to ensure safety of women in the state. Yogi asked officers to strengthen initiatives introduced to tackle crime against women such as 1090 (Women Powerline) and UP-100.
