SHIMLA: A day after chief minister   termed the Kasauli shootout incident a blot on the state police, DGP S R Mardi on Wednesday convened a meeting of police officials from Shimla, Solan, Baddi, Sirmaur and   districts to discuss various administrative and legal issues as well as to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the police service.

 The Wednesday’s meeting at the police headquarters in Shimla was attended by the superintendents of police (SPs), sub divisional police officers and all station house officers of the southern range.
 
 Sources said the DGP has asked all the officers and officials to work hard improve law and order situation in the state and the SP of the district concerned would be answerable for any laxity in his area.
 
 Later, addressing media persons, DGP Mardi said the basic objective of the meeting was to ensure law and order was maintained in the state. He said night patrolling would be strengthened and a separate WhatsApp group would be created for all the police stations for the purpose. “This will help check crime,” he added.
 
 He said to keep the youth away from the menace of drugs, policemen in civil clothes would be deployed around educational institutions and that directions would be issued to the SHOs to conduct surprise checks at dhabas and shops near such institutions.
 
 He said police were making all efforts to ensure the safety of women in the state, adding that mining and other mafia would also be dealt with strictly under the provisions of law.
