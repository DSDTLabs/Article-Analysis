Mumbai: The   has refuted allegations that it had colluded with the   toll contractor to collect  . The state's response was made in an affidavit to the HC filed earlier this month to counter a PIL that sought directions to revoke the contractor's right to collect toll till August 2019.

 The PIL, by activist Pravin Wategaonkar, alleged that the contractor had already met the collection target and was pocketing excess collection. It also alleged under-reporting of toll collection. 
 
 "The allegations as regards the collusion between the state and the contractor to secure perpetual wrongful gains are false and denied," said Avinash Dhondge, deputy secretary (public works department) in the affidavit filed earlier this month. "The allegations of criminal liability (both individual and collective) are baseless. There is no misappropriation on the part of the government or its officers by allowing the contractor to continue to appropriate toll income. The contractor is receiving toll income by virtue of an agreement between the parties," added the affidavit.
 
 The toll collection for the Expressway started in 2004 and with regards to NH4 in 2006. The composite contract was for Rs 4,330 crore. According to the  , as of May 2016 the toll collection was Rs 4,075 crore. 
 
 In its affidavit, the MSRDC claimed that the under-reporting could be due to the fact that some categories of vehicles were exempted from paying toll. The MSRDC denied any wrongful gain to the contractor. “The collection of toll is being done as per the concession agreement which is binding on all parties,” the MSRDC said.
