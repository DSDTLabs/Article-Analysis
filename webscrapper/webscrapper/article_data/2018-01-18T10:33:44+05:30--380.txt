NEW DELHI. Pakistan on Wednesday refuted media reports of a possible Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) level talks with India, reported ANI.

  “No meeting of DGMOs of Pakistan and India is being considered as of now as reported by a section of media. The news is baseless and misleading,” read a statement from Pakistan Ministry of Defence, Office of Assistant Director Media.
 
  This clarification from Pakistan’s defence ministry comes in the backdrop of several media reports that Pakistan was examining a proposal for a DGMO-level meeting with India after a gap of four years to reduce tensions along the Line of Control.
 
 The last telephonic conversation between the two DGMOs took place in November last year, following a request by the Pakistani side. 
 
  Pakistan-India DGMOs have a frequent hotline contact, but they last met face-to-face four years ago at Wagah, a village which serves as a transit terminal between Lahore and Amritsar.
 
  The December 24, 2013 Wagah meeting had taken place after a break of 14 years. That meeting too was held to discuss ways to ensure peace along the LoC and the Working Boundary.
 
  Despite the rising number of unprovoked  , it has remained in touch with India, most noticeably in the form of the ongoing engagement between NSA Ajit Doval and his counterpart Nasir Janjua.
