KOHIMA: The president of the ruling Naga People's Front ( ), Shurhozelie Liezietsu, on Tuesday released the party's election manifesto which vowed to fight for a 'shared homeland' and integration of Naga-inhabited areas. 

 The 32-page manifesto stated that NPF will continue to support and work towards realization of a common Naga homeland and future through integration of contiguous Naga-inhabited areas. It said NPF will institute a separate peace subvention fund for providing support to all efforts aimed at expediting the resolution of the Naga political issue. The party will also vigorously and persistently work to facilitate an honourable conclusion to the protracted problem.
 
 Liezietsu said the 2018 election manifesto is one of the party's best manifestos since its inception. "It is not a mere wishlist. The points in it are considered to be within our reach," he said. He said the NPF is committed to the people of Nagaland for implement what is assured in the manifesto. Asked about the recent BJP-NDPP alliance, Liezietsu said NPF and BJP had shared an alliance since 2003 but this time the latter had walked away on its own. "It is a blessing in disguise for NPF," he added. Expressing confidence that NPF will come back to power, he said the party will try to accommodate smaller political parties who want to form an alliance with it.
