Surat: Israel-based Sarin Technologies has filed a law suit against Surat-based diamond manufacturing company alleging it of fraud and breach of contract.  Sarin Technologies, a diamond-technology company based in Israel and having its office in Surat, alleged copyright infringement by Surat’s Rose Gems, which was reported internally by the company last month. The diamond company illegally hacked and manipulated Sarin’s Galaxy inclusion-mapping system and deliberately under-reported the weight of rough stones it scanned in order to underpay for the use of the technology. Replying to an email query, CEO of Sarin Technologies David Block said, “The company has filed a lawsuit against Bhimji Italia and Mayup Italia of Rose Gems having offices in Surat and Mumbai for the breach of contract and fraud.”  Block added, “The Sarin Group will continue to pursue any party that attempts to violate our intellectual property or to abuse our systems. We have adopted a zero-tolerance approach to unlawful use of our technologies and will continue to invest every resource necessary to bring the full brunt of the law as well as other channels to enforce Sarin’s rights.”  Sarin’s subsidiary Galatea first noticed there was a problem when an internal audit showed a long-term discrepancy between the weight of the stones being processed in the system and those Rose Gems was reporting.  Sarin is seeking a permanent injunction to prevent Rose Gems from using its software pending the outcome of the case as well as financial damages of more than $750,000. It also wants the court to require Rose Gems to turn over its full accounts to the court or an independent expert for review.
