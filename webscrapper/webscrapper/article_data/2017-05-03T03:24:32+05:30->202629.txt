GURUGRAM: Around a dozen members of various right wing outfits met officials at the deputy commissioner’s office at Vikas Sadan on Tuesday, and demanded stern action against Pakistan for beheading one   jawan and a BSF trooper along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir.

 There was also an ominous warning. “We are deliberating on what should be done about the pro-azadi Kashmiris staying in Gurgaon and Delhi. We are planning to protest against them peacefully. We will demonstrate and chant nationalist slogans like ‘Bharat mein rehna hoga, vande mataram kehna hoga’,” said said Rajeev Mittal, national spokesperson for Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Kranti Dal (ABHKD), a fringe outfit. 
 
 This comes close on the heels of an attack against Kashmiri students in Rajasthan’s Mewar University, following which Union home minister Rajnath Singh appealed to all state governments to ensure safety of Kashmiris.
 
 Members of RSS, ABHKD, Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal handed over the memorandum to junior officials as deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh was not present in his office. The members demanded another   against Pakistan like the one that was carried out in September 2016. 
 
 “We are concerned about the sudden rise in terror attacks on our jawans in Kashmir. We want the President, the Prime Minister and the Army to take stern action against Pakistan, and the stone pelters,” Mittal said. 
 
 “I was on a field visit when the right wing members had come to my office. We will ensure that the memorandums reach all concerned persons to whom they have been addressed,” Singh told TOI.
