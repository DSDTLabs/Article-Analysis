PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Four commercial establishments were   in a fire in the Kudalwadi area of   on Friday afternoon.

 The fire officer of the   (PCMC),  , said, “The   spread over a total area of around 5,000sqft were near the nullah on Dehu-Alandi road in Kudalwadi. The fire began around 4pm and was doused in one-and-a-half hours.”
 
 He said, “Six to seven fire engines of the PCMC fire brigade with four water tankers were pressed into service to douse the fire. Fire engines from nearby private companies also came to help in dousing the fire. Around 15 to 20 civic employees were involved in the operation.”
 
 Gawde said, “The lanes and roads are narrow in the Kudalwadi area, housing a large number of scrap godowns. Fire engines often struggle to reach the spot and douse the flames there. But these shops were along the wide Dehu-Alandi road. So, the fire tenders could easily reach the spot. As a result, a lot of furniture and wood was saved.”
 
 BJP corporator Rahul Jadhav said, “Fires in the scrap godowns located in Kudalwadi cause air pollution. They are stuffed with scrap material of various types. As a result, it becomes difficult for the fire engines to douse the flames. The scrap godowns must be shifted to prevent the adjacent residential areas from being affected by fires.” 
 
 A fortnight ago, on March 9, a godown along Chikhali-Talawade road that was being used to store wood was gutted in a fire. It took the fire brigade two hours to bring the fire under control. Three fire engines and two tankers were used in the operation.
 
 Staff working at the godown, spread over a plot measuring around 10,000sqft, detected the fire and called the fire brigade. Wood blocks, wood material and machinery were burned in the fire.
