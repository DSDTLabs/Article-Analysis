Panaji: Deputy collector (flying squad North Goa) has slapped yet another showcause notice in a land reclamation case, this time, in a low-lying field along NH 17 at Goa Velha.

 With the number of land-filling and hill-cutting cases rising significantly, the authorities had recently issued a series of notices in Revora, Saligao, Pilerne, Parra, Ribandar and other places.
 
 In this case, an area of about 300 sq m has been filled up on the land bearing survey No 74/13 of Goa Velha. A complaint regarding the illegal activity had been received by the authorities recently.
 
 The flying squad team inspected the site and submitted a report confirming the land filling. “An area of an approximate length of 25m, width 12m and height of 1m in the said property has been mudfilled in violation of Section 17-A of Town and Country Planning (TCP) Act, 1974,” the report said.
 
 The collector has directed the concerned persons to immediately showcause within three days from the receipt of the notice as to why a stop work order should not be issued to halt the activity.
 
 If he/she fails to produce the required documents, then it will be presumed that he/she is not in possession of the same and TCP will initiate action towards restoration of the land. 
 
 Further, authorities will initiate action as deemed fit to ensure restoration of land and as per penal provisions of the act.
