CHENNAI: Running out of balance in your smart card, but are in a hurry to catch a metro train? Quit waiting in the ticket counter   and hop on the next train, Chennai   Limited (CMRL) is here to save your day.   allows its passengers to board a train if they have a minimum balance of Rs 10 in their   and they can pay the rest of the ticket price when they recharge the card later for the next trip.

 Metro rail officials said that their ticketing systems have been programmed to allow commuters to walk out of a station after a ride without having to pay the entire ticket price. The automatic fare collection (AFC) gates will open and allow the passenger to leave upon swiping the smart card. However, the commuter should have a minimum balance of Rs 10 in their smart card and will be allowed only one such ride.
 
 “It is a policy decision to allow passengers with low balance to take a ride. The remainder of the ticket price will be deducted when they recharge the next time,” said a metro rail official.
 
 The exemption, is allowed only once, and if a passenger takes a ride carrying a smart card with low balance for the second time, the AFC gates will not open and the commuter will have to pay for the ticket before exiting the station.
 
 “We came up with the idea to encourage commuters to take metro trains regularly. And, this option is given to commuters only once to avoid misuse,” an official said.
 
 CMRL introduced smart cards when they launched their first service between Koyambedu and Alandur in June 2015. Commuters were also given an option to buy tokens. But CMRL made smart cards mandatory after they launched the underground section between Nehru Park and Thirumangalam in May 2017. More than 10.7 lakh smart cards have been sold since June 2015 and more than 8.4 lakh cards are still in use by commuters. To encourage commuters to buy smart cards, CMRL gives a 10% discount on ticket prices.
