NEW DELHI: In response to Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan's open attack on senior AAP functionary  , AAP MLAs are seen rallying hard against him on social media.

 While rumours of a letter signed by more than 30 MLAs seeking Amanatullah's expulsion is doing the rounds, there is no official confirmation of it yet.
 
 However, the sense of what the MLAs feel is evident on their Twitter timelines where they have either tweeted their protest at Amanatullah's allegations or retweeted the remarks of MLAs thinking along similar lines.
 
 The food and supplies minister Imran Hussain tweeted saying that the Okhla MLA has "lost his mental balance". 
 
  
  
 To counter the buzz over demand from within the party that a new national convener should be appointed, a tweet from Burari MLA Sanjeev Jha is the latest. He has said, "Arvind Kejriwal is our only leader".
 
  
  
 Interestingly, the MLAs TOI spoke to want some clarity on how AAP will tackle its down slide in Delhi which is evident from the Delhi municipal poll result. The thought of a new convener is part of that discourse. 
 
 Amid all this, the   will be meeting tonight.
 
 Amanatullah stood firm on his allegations made on Sunday when he spoke to TOI and challenged Delhi minister Kapil Mishra to prove his allegation that the Okhla MLA has been working against the party. 
 
 "I am raising my voice because I want to counter forces that are trying to damage the party from within," he said. 
 
 He asserted that he sees only CM Arvind Kejriwal as the national convener.
