New Delhi:   Nazrul Islam had come to the capital with his wife and two children as a migrant labourer. Soon he learnt to drive and took up a driver’s job with a private company. 

 When he began plying the Uber cab, he started earning enough to sustain his family in Gurgaon as well as his ailing grandmother and elder brother at their village in South Dinajpur, West Bengal.
 
 His wife, Arjana Biwi, was expecting him to return early on Sunday night, but instead she got a call from the police about the accident.
 
 Islam’s parents had died while he was young. He started working as a daily wager in Kolkata to help his disabled brother complete schooling. In 2009, he shifted to Delhi to work as a labourer at a Metro construction site. 
 
 “We left our son in the village and my husband worked day and night to take care of his family here and in the village,” Arjana said.
 
 He joined Uber in 2014 and saved enough to buy his own house. “He had started driving the cab for a new owner two days ago so that he could earn more to fund his brother’s treatment in Delhi. We want the errant driver’s family to give us compensation. My uncle’s family has decided to go back to the village,” said Islam’s nephew, Moidul. His body will be handed over to the family on Tuesday after autopsy.
