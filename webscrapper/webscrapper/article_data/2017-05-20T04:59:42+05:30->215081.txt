AHMEDABAD: A man wanted in a 2003 forgery case by   has been deported from Baghdad. Mohammad Kasim Bhangur, now in his early fifties, was brought to the   at 4.30am on Friday. As he has come back from Iraq, currently a war zone, state police officials will question him on his whereabouts for the past decade and the reason he had forged his passport.

 CID (crime) officials said that Palanpur taluka police had registered a complaint against Bhangur after it was discovered that the documents he had provided — such as school leaving certificate — for his passport had been forged. Bhangur was suspected to have left the country and thus CID (crime) initiated the process to issue a   (RCN) against him. The RCN was issued in 2005.
 
 “Between 2005 and January 2017, there was no news on him,” said U B Rawal, detective inspector, CID (crime). “Then late in January, authorities of Baghdad airport informed Gujarat Police about Bhangur, who wanted to go for haj. As there was no extradition treaty between the two countries, Bhangur was kept in prison for over four months.”
 
 It was through DGP Ashish Bhatia’s efforts that Bhangur was deported from Baghdad to Ahmedabad. Banaskantha Police got his custody on Friday. Sources said that agencies such as the local crime branch and the state ATS are interested to know about Bhangur’s activities in various Gulf countries.
