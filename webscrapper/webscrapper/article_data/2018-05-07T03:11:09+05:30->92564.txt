NEW DELHI: A half-burnt body of a man was found in a park in southeast Delhi's Tughlakabad on Sunday morning. 

 Senior police officers said that the body was spotted by kids who had come to the ground to play cricket. Cops were then informed and the body has been sent for autopsy.
 
 A preliminary probe has revealed that the man was attacked with a sharp object.
 
 Cameras from the area are being scanned to ascertain the identity of the people who dumped the body. It is suspected that the accused burnt him so he couldn't be recognised.
