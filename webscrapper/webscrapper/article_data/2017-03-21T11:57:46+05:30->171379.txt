HYDERABAD: An   of hate crime victim   is pressing the   (FBI) to prosecute the suspect   to the fullest extent of law.

 Vindhya Adapa of Priceton, New Jersey, who has been to the  , and a former legal intern at United Nations, started an online petition that will be forwarded to the FBI seeking such prosecution in the Olathe crime. “I found out that Srinivas Kuchibhotla, the 32-year-old Indian man brutally murdered in Kansas in ahate crime, is a distant relative of mine through marriage. I was shocked and a little numb after the fact, as I have never met him and I did not know this,“ Vindhya said on her Facebook.
 
 Urging people to sign the petition she said, “Being in a country with the most lax gun rules on earth, as a deranged and racist lunatic, the suspect was easily able to get a gun and do the ultimate deed.“ The petition she started will be forwarded to FBI after a few more people sign it. “Public opinion does not charge or prosecute someone, the law does. But by indicating our frustration, we encourage the federal authorities to leave no stone unturned and communicate our feelings about double standards in delivering justice,“ she said.
