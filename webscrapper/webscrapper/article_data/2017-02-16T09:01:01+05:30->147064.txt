VADODARA: The   of the   ( ) on Thursday is expected to be an eventful one. The opposition has moved 746 suggestions that it wants to be included in the budget that was cleared by the standing committee on February 1.

 The suggestions include 652 by the opposition   members and 94 by the   that has its presence in only one ward of the city and has four councillors. Sources said that the number of suggestions this year has gone up by around 100 as compared to last year.
 
 The committee passed the budget for the financial year 2017-18 after reducing the hikes in charges of some facilities and services suggested by the VMC administration. The budget size was reduced to Rs 3,757.34 crore from Rs 3,770.43crore as suggested by the administration.
 
 The budget is considered to be a rare one where the VMC administration had made no suggestions of hikes in taxes or any changes in factors for calculation of property tax. Usually, such suggestions are made by the administration and the elected wing either strikes them down or rationalises them.
 
 The VMC opposition has not reacted to the budget so far. It is expected to do so only during discussions in the general board. The meeting that will begin on Thursday evening is expected to go on for three days. The Congress members who were expected to attend a state Congress meeting will not be going for the party meeting and have informed the state leadership.
