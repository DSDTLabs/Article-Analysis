LUCKNOW: The accusation against MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in   rape case has brought focus on turncoats who switched to the   recently and have become an embarrassment for the BJP ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

 Four Dalits MPs, who had joined the BJP ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha elections, have accused the government of being anti-Dalit.
 
 The pattern has flummoxed BJP which opened its doors to leaders of other parties and made inroads in the vote banks of the Samajwadi Party and the   in 2014 elections while riding on the popularity of Narendra Modi.
 
 Party leaders confide of growing apprehension within the party for leaders who were inducted into the party before 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections. “It is a dangerous trend. The party leadership is keeping a close watch and would devise a strategy accordingly,” a senior BJP leader told TOI.
 
 BJP’s Dalit MP from Bahraich, Savitri Bai Phule, who held a rally in Lucknow on April 1 claiming that reservation rights of Dalits were under threat, had started her career as a sector coordinator of BSP in Balha reserved constituency.
 
 Dalit MP from Etawah, Ashok Kumar Dohre, who blamed the Yogi government for atrocities on Dalits after April 2 violence, was a cabinet minister in the BSP government. Mayawati had removed him from her cabinet on charges of misconduct and subsequently denied him a ticket in 2012 elections.
 
 MP from Nagina, Yashwant Singh, recently wrote to the PM, accusing the BJP government of doing nothing for Dalits. Singh had been a part of Ajit Singh’s Rashtriya Lok Dal. Prior to that, he was a BSP MLA.
 
 State BJP spokesperson   said people who join BJP have to adopt party’s ‘reeti’ (tradition) and ‘neeti’ (policy) also. “If they are having any problem they can leave the party. No one is above the party,” he said.
