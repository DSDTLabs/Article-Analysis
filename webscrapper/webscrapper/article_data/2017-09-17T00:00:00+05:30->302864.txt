Actor   will be playing the lead in ' ', which will have him don the khakhi for the first time. The film is directed by debutant Sakthi Vel, who has worked on many ad films. Says the actor, “I have always wanted to play a cop like the ones we see in Gautham Menon’s films. Given that I’m playing a cop for the first time in my career, I took some tips from an inspector friend in Theni to play this role. My character is that of an honest, young and energetic assistant commissioner of police. The film will be a bit different from the usual cop movies we see in our industry.”

 Since the director and he are producing the film, the actor says that they have shot a 20-minute pilot film to generate buzz in the industry circles. “We shot the pilot in Chennai and in locations along the Chennai-Nellore highway for a week,” he reveals.
 
 The pilot’s teaser was released by IPS officer Asra Garg, who, Soundararaja says, is a long-time friend. “We did not want to launch it with a film celebrity and decided that a dashing cop will be the right person to release it. Garg has many achievements to his credit and he was the youngest IPS cadet in his batch. I’m proud that he is associated with the film in this way,” gushes the actor.
