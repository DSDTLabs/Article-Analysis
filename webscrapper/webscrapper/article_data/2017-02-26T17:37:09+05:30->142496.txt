 was not kidding when he said on his 40th birthday that he was going to up his game. 

 For his upcoming movie  , which is directed by  , the actor is going the whole nine yards to play the titular character.
  For the uninitiated, the director had earlier told us that the movie's protagonist Ram Menon aka Raman lives in his estate, which spans 500 acres that is untouched by technology.
 
  To prepare for the part, Kunchacko Boban has not taken up any film since Christmas last year and has been busy focusing on getting in shape. 'For starters, I learnt to climb trees just like how children or people who are more agile would do. That was what I was up to during Christmas. I practised on the mango tree behind my house in Alappuzha,' says the actor.
 
  He also says that despite being someone who is reluctant to hit the gym, he took that up and has reaped benefits as well. 'I have had ligament tears on my shoulders in the past. It was so bad that there was a time when I needed assistance from my right arm to lift my left. So, after the weight training, I can now lift a few kilos without much trouble,' says Kunchacko, whose next release will be Take Off.
 
  Apart from the gym and climbing trees, the actor's third challenge is to control his diet. 'I am hoping to stick to a healthy diet once I reach the shoot location at Vagamon. But because my wife Priya would also be with me, I don't know howmuch of that would be possible,' laughs the actor, adding that he is also growing out his hair and beard for the film.
 
 The actor though says that the character of Raman is someone he could relate to. 'He's positive and loves to be connected to nature. He sees the hidden talents in people and brings them out,' he signs off.
