Ghaziabad: Two armed robbers broke into the house of a BSNL engineer in   on Wednesday. The incident took place at the two-storey house of Upendra Teotia in Govindpuram at around 2 pm and the masked robbers allegedly took the owner’s grandson hostage.

 The men allegedly entered the ground floor of the house posing as courier delivery boys. Teotia (56), a junior engineer, was in his office in Raj Nagar at the time of the incident and his two sons were out for work.
 
 The robbers allegedly threatened Teotia’s younger daughter-in-law Beenu(32) who lives on the ground floor.
 
 “The men entered and knocked on the door of the ground floor. Beenu opened the wooden door when the men said they had arrived to deliver a courier. The men forced open the wire mesh door by kicking against it as soon as she opened the wooden door. They picked up my grandson and held a knife to his neck. They threatened to slit his throat if Beenu did not hand over valuables kept inside the house. They took her inside one of the rooms and forced her to hand over all the jewelry she was wearing. The men also forced her to open an almirah and searched inside for valuables,” said Teotia. Beenu shouted for help after the men left following which Teotia’s older daughter-in-law rushed downstairs. 
 
 On the basis of a complaint lodged by Teotia’s family, Ghaziabad police registered an FIR under IPC section 392 (loot) in Kavi Nagar police station against unidentified persons.
 
 “We are scanning CCTV footage of the area. From the description given to us about the robbers, it seems they are local youth,” said Kavi Nagar circle officer Atish Kumar Singh.
