Madurai: State minister of information and field publicity Kadambur C Raju along with minister for khadi and village industries G Baskaran garlanded the statue of Queen Velunachiyar at the memorial hall constructed in her memory at Soorakulam village near Kalayarkoil in Sivaganga district on Wednesday. Sivaganga district collector K Latha, police SP T Jayachandran and officials from district administration were present. People had gathered in large numbers to pay their tributes to the queen.

 Queen Velunachiyar was one among the pioneers to resist British East India Company rule in the region and she had also successfully regained her kingdom from the company waging valiant wars. Born to Ramanathapuram King Sellamuthu Sethupathy in 1730, the princess, without any male heir to throne, was raised on par with men to handle any weapon and in martial arts, horse riding as well as in foreign languages.
 
 She was married to Sivaganga King Muthuvaduganathar but the couple had to fight a war against Arcot Nawab who was assisted by British East India Company in 1772. The king was killed in the battle at Kalayarkoil and Velunachiyar along with her daughter went into a hiding at Dindigul for eight years.
 
 She raised an army during those years and assisted by Mysore ruler Hyder Ali and Marudhu brothers, she waged a war against her enemies and defeated them. She ruled Sivaganga for a decade from 1780 to 90, succumbing to illness in 1796.
 
 Late chief minister J Jayalalithaa inaugurated her memorial hall in 2014 and January 3 has been announced as government function to remember the queen. Velunachiyar’s legacy in Sivaganga region is pretty evident as ‘Nachiyar’ is respectful title to address women. “Velunachiyar is a name very close to heart of the people here and my father calls me as well as my young nieces often as ‘nachiyar’”, says M Abirami hailing from Sivaganga.
