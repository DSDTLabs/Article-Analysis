NEW DELHI: A   was   at her   in   near Shahdara’s   on Monday night. As the house was  , cops suspect that the killers might have fled  .

 “We are questioning the family members and relatives to find out the motive behind the murder. Evidence collected from the house is being examined,” said (DCP) Shahdara Nupur Prasad.
 
 The incident took place around 7pm when the woman, Leena Tahliani, was found with her throat slit in her bedroom. While Tahliani lived alone on the ground floor of the four-storeyed building, her son Bhishma lived with his family on the first floor. The other two floors were rented out.
 
 On Tuesday morning, Bhishma left home with his wife and son leaving their house keys with Tahliani. He had gone to Lajpat Nagar to meet his in-laws and returned only in the evening.
 
 Bhishma told cops that when he returned home, he found his flat keys beside a window near the main gate of his mother’s apartment. “I found her door locked and presumed that she had left the keys there and gone to meet a friend,” said Bhishma.
 
 However, when Tahliani did not return after sometime, Bhishma grew suspicious and tried to break open the door of her apartment. He also informed cops and a team from Vivek Vihar police station reached the house and broke open the door.
 
 Tahliani was found lying in a pool of blood beside her bed. Prima facie evidence suggested that she might have had a scuffle with the killers before they slit her throat. The room also appeared to have been ransacked by the assailants.
 
 Tahliani’s body was sent for an autopsy and handed over to the family members later. A case of murder has been registered, said a police officer. Cops are questioning some of Tahliani’s relatives to find out whether she was having a dispute with someone over the property.
 
 Tahliani’s had sold their ancestral property to a builder who had constructed the apartment for the family. Bhishma too would be questioned regarding the incident, the officer added.
