NASHIK:   candidate  , who is an ayurveda practitioner and a diploma holder in Buddhism with Pali language, has education and women’s empowerment as her priorities. Khare is contesting from prabhag 2 (scheduled caste). She is now studying for her second year ophthalmology.

 “I have been conducting free eye check-up camps for the poor and needy, along with my husband. On every anniversary of our hospital we conduct a camp at district level. We have a multi-purpose organisation with doctors, lawyers, engineers and other professionals. We focus on   empowerment and this will be my priority as a corporator. Also, we will guide graduates and housewives in MPSC and UPSC exams,” Khare said.
 
 “I want to construct a computerised library for children. For students in class VIII to X, we will conduct motivational lectures and career guidance so that they could pursue their dreams with confidence,” she said.
 
 Khare said people in her prabhag live in unhygienic conditions but they did not even realise it. She wanted to provide them a clean and healthy environment.
 
 “It was not my aim to get into politics. But since the prabhag is reserved for scheduled caste women, people have been asking me to contest. I have been doing lot of social work and the political support will make me do it better,” she said.
