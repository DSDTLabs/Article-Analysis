LUCKNOW: Lucknow   has made online   payment mandatory for students enrolled last year and for those who will be admitted in the new academic session.

 Both UG and PG students will no more have to stand in a queue to submit their fees at the cashier office as every student will get a login for online payment.
 
 Earlier, students had to take the counselling form from the cashier’s office, fill it and get it signed from the head of the department and thereafter had to submit it in the cashier’s office with fees. This time-taking process will no more be followed for fee payment. Students will be able to submit fees online after an online approval from the respective head of the department.
 
 “Every head of the department has two sections in his/her university portal login. One is for maintaining a departmental profile and the second for student verification. As fee payment facility is online, students have to only once report to the department with the marksheet for verification,” said director of the university data resource centre Anil  .
 
 He said the department head will tick the student’s name in the ‘pass’ category of the respective examination and an online fee payment link will be activated.
 
 A meeting of all heads will be held with vice chancellor   and Mishra on Thursday to inform them of the new system.
