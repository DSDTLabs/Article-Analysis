JAIPUR: Inspector general of police (Jaipur range)   told TOI that the investigation officer in the case of the suicide of two teenaged sisters from   in Sikar district has now been handed over to additional SP Vandana Bhati from his office. Bajrang Singh and Vicky Singh were arrested on Thursday in this case. 

 The two girls had committed suicide on April 5, flinging themselves under a train. They were both students in the first year of an undergraduate course at the government college in Neem ka Thana. Their 16-year-old brother had maintained that he had seen them with their clothes torn when he returned home that day. Three men were in the house – two Rajputs and one Brahmin. 
 
 Police however, had been reluctant to include sections of IPC pertaining to rape, and had insisted that this was a case of suicide. Activists noted that the police force was filled with Rajputs who were out to protect their own. Deputy SP of Neem Ka Thana  , a Rajput, was earlier investigating officer. He told TOI that he had mobile phone call records to show the girls had called the men.
 
 Meanwhile, journalist and Dalit activist  , who made elaborate posts on this crime on Facebook said he had received threats from someone he was not acquainted with. A man called Manipal Singh Ranawat has posted a message to him attempting to convince him that people do not ask after caste before raping – it was unfair to publicly shame perpetrators on the basis of caste, Ranawat said, adding that Meghwanshi had better watch out – he would be left with no hands to make posts anymore.
 
 Meghwanshi, however, has said that the violent posts on social media only show a rising culture of intolerance for the views of Dalits. “It is also a reflection of lax policing and poor security for the weak. I will, if necessary, take this matter to police,” he said.
