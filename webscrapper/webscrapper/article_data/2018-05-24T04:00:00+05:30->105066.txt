Mumbai: In a major move,   has changed the dividend payout model of Jaguar Land Rover ( ). The UK arm, which accounts for a bulk of the parent Tata Motors’  , will now pay at least 20% of its   as dividend instead of a fixed sum.

 The dividend policy was changed in fiscal 2018 and, as a result, JLR paid 225 million pounds (about Rs 2,054 crore) — 20% of its profit — as dividend to Tata Motors. The payout was 50% higher than the fixed amount (150 million pounds) JLR doled out in fiscal 2017. Tata Motors had acquired JLR a decade ago and the asset has been a money-spinner for the parent. In fiscal 2019, JLR will pay 25% of its profit as dividend, Tata Motors CFO P B Balaji said.
 
 While higher dividend boosts major shareholder Tata Motors’  , the Indian company, on the other hand, hasn’t declared a dividend to its   for nearly two years. Losses at its domestic operations had prevented Tata Motors from paying dividends. In fiscal 2016, Tata Motors had given a dividend of 20 paise to ordinary shareholders and 30 paise to class A shareholders. While Balaji didn’t comment as to when Tata Motors will be able to declare a dividend, he said that the company is on a turnaround path.
 
 Tata Tech,   stake sales: The company’s proposed path to profits also include a review of its portfolio of assets worth Rs 2,757 crore. Tata Motors, the flagship of the $100-billion Tata Group, is looking to sell its interests in auto and aircraft design firm, Tata Technologies, as well as in construction equipment making company, Tata Hitachi. The Japanese manufacturer, which holds 60% in Tata Hitachi, has the first right to buy Tata Motors’ 40% stake in the 18-year-old joint venture. 
 
 To take a call on Tata Nano: After pulling the plug on the Indica and Indigo models, Tata Motors will take a call on its budget car  . “The Nano, in its current form, will not be able to meet the crash test norms in 2019 and, so, we will have to take a decision on it,” Balaji said. In April, Tata Motors manufactured just 45 Nanos. “We are working on a plan for Nano,” Balaji said. The plan could be an electric version of the jelly-bean shaped car.
 
 Profits halved on one-time charges
 
 Mumbai: A one-time impairment charge on certain product development projects and higher expenses halved Tata Motors’ quarterly profit to Rs 2,175 crore. Its profit in the January-March quarter of fiscal 2017 was Rs 4,336 crore. Income from operations rose 16% to Rs 91,643 crore. JLR accounted for 76% of Tata Motors’ revenues. JLR faces geo-political uncertainties like Britain’s exit from the European Union in 2019, which will create trade barriers and automotive technology challenges, among others. On a standalone basis, Tata Motors reported a loss of Rs 500 crore in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. In the same period of fiscal 2017, its loss was Rs 729 crore. TNN
