As the mega auction for the Indian Premier League's 11th edition draws near, a whopping 1,122 Indian and overseas cricketers have signed up to go under the hammer this season. 

 With the deadline to make themselves available for auction ending on Friday, the Australians (58) topped the list of overseas players, followed by the South Africans (57). STOI gives a low down on the numbers and the big names to look forward to at the auction, which will be held in Bengaluru on January 27 and 28.
