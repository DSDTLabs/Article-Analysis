PATNA: The Patna   on Monday expressed its unhappiness over the lack of experts in the home department’s forensic science laboratory (FSL) in Patna.

 The division bench of Justices Ravi Ranjan and Prakash Chandra Jaiswal, while hearing a criminal writ petition filed by advocate Nand Kishore Prasad, ordered the home department principal secretary to file a counter affidavit within two weeks on how many forensic experts have retired till now and about the vacancies in the laboratories as well as the staff strength. 
 
 Prasad moved the high court after his 21-year-old son Abhishek Kumar went missing. An FIR was lodged with the   police station in Supaul district on July 17 last year against four of his friends on whose call he had gone out. However, the narco analysis test of the accused could not be conducted in the FSL due to lack of experts.
 
 The HC rapped the home department and made an oral observation that why not the laboratory be shut down if it can’t conduct necessary tests.
