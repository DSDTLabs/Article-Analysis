HYDERABAD: The Bhupalpally district collector has been urged to publicly denounce his call for killing of wild boar and consume their meat by people with a caution that not only is killing of wild boar currently prohibited in Telangana, but any consumption of its meat too is prohibited by law. 

 In a letter to district collector A Murali, Imran Siddiqui, a member with the   said any permission for hunting of wild boar, that too by a panel of 17 hunters appointed by the chief wildlife warden of the state, expired on December 28, 2016. 
 
 Anyone propagating the hunting of the animal or consumption of its meat will also fall foul of High Court orders in a writ petition (PIL), No 37 of 2016 on the subject of hunting of wild boar, Siddiqui told the collector in his letter. The Wildlife Protection Act states that any wild animal killed in defence of any person or their property becomes government property. A post-mortem needs to be performed after which the animal's body needs to be disposed off by destroying the carcass, he said.
 
 He further said that the HC, in the case, had clearly said "there should not be any killing allowed in sanctuaries and national parks, If at all any such killing occurs, a case should be booked under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972." Siddiqui further said that the collector's statement around   is thus in violation of the HC order and the spirit of the Wildlife Protection Act.
