MUMBAI: The state has revised norms of awarding   to students who excel in sports, making it possible for more children to avail them. While the earlier norms required students to meet two criteria, now they will have to qualify only for one of the two criteria.

 According to a government resolution issued by the school education department on Tuesday, students will now have to either participate in international tournaments or secure one of the top three positions at national-level tournaments to get additional 25 marks in SSC and HSC exams. Similarly, students who participate in national-level sports tournaments or win at state-level sports tournaments will get 20 extra marks. Students who participate in tournaments organized by the state government or any state-level sports tournaments will be awarded 15 additional marks.
 
 In 2015,   were reintroduced after a three-year break. Many had alleged that   marks were misused by students giving them an unfair advantage as many students secured 100% in board exams. But when the state reintroduced the scheme, it laid down detailed guidelines. According to these rules, students have to participate in international and local tournaments and win at the national level to score 25 additional marks and participate in national and local tournaments and win at the state level to get 20 extra marks.
 
 “The intention was to ensure that students who excel in sports get a boost in academics. While rest of the rules will remain the same, this change will mean that more students will be able to benefit from the scheme,” said S Kharat, deputy secretary, school education department.
