Vadodara: The rift in the Revival Group in Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) surfaced again on Monday after a member of the umpires committee Suhas Sapre tendered his resignation as he wasn’t happy with the functioning at the association. He said that he won’t be joining any other group as of now. 

 Sapre said that he was co-opted in the umpires committee in October 2016 by the management. “Having umpired in many matches, I wanted to contribute to the association by preparing the next line of umpires. I had planned to train new young umpires and prepare them for BCCI exams so that we could have more quality umpires in the future,” Sapre told TOI.
 
 “But BCA management showed no interest in my proposal. The office-bearers are making contradictory statements while taking decisions. While in some decisions, they say that approval of managing committee is required, few other decisions are taken directly,” Sapre said. 
 
 He also said that a suspended umpire was recently allotted an Under-14 match and the umpires committee wasn’t even informed about it.
 
 “Also, no action is initiated against any player despite umpires complaining against their poor behavior on field. A cricketer had tampered ball in a local match last year and I had raised the issue. But no action was taken against the player. When I objected to some of their decisions, the management took away my authority to appoint umpires last month. I felt that I am being harassed and that I am not able to contribute to the association. So, I resigned,” Sapre said. 
 
 He said that he would serve the association if there is good management at BCA.
