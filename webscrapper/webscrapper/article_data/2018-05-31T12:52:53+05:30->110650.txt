PUNE: Three Nigerian nationals, including a woman, were booked for duping   (32) of Rs1.84 lakh on the pretext of offering him a job in a foreign country. 

 A resident of Sasanenagar, Kashid had applied for the post of a housing keeping supervisor in a private firm on a job portal. He had posted his profile on it in November 2017. One of the suspects contacted him on a social networking site, claiming to be the owner-cum-managing director of a firm in London, and requested him to appear for a recruitment examination. 
 
 
  
 
 The fraudster and his accomplices then lured him into depositing varying amounts in different bank accounts in Bengaluru, Satara and Pune to cover the costs of the recruitment process. The fees included appearing for the examination, receiving an appointment letter, medical check-up, conducting verifications, issuing embassy invite and an anti-terrorist certificate.
 
 Kashid deposited the money through online transfers between November 11 and December 14, 2017 without verifying the claims of the fraudsters, police said. He suspected foul play only after the fraudsters continued demanding for money over the phone. 
 
 He started to avoid their demands and delayed depositing money. He eventually realized he was cheated after the   failed to get him a job. Kashid lodged a complaint after he did not get his money back. 
 
 An FIR has been lodged for cheating among other charges of the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act. The police suspect that the bank accounts were opened on the basis of forged documents. Anjum Bagwan, an inspector of the Hadapsar police, is investigating the case.
