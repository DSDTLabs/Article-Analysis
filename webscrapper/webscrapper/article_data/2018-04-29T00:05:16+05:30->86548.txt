Salem: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Saturday said the state leads the country in raw silk manufacturing and announced cash prizes to farmers to boost the production of raw silk further.

 Addressing a gathering after inaugurating a seminar and exhibition on silk here in the city, he said, “We get 80kg of raw silk from 100 cocoons and in this front too we are placed first in the national level.”
 
 However, the chief minister said the state was still facing shortage of raw silk. “Our need is at least 3,000 tonne and we are able to produce only 1,900 tonne. “So, there is a shortage of 1,100 tonne,” he said and urged the farmers to get involved in cocoon business.
 
 Palaniswami also announced a cash prize of Rs 25,000 for farmers who produce more than 80kg of raw silk from 100 cocoon at the district level and Rs 20,000 and Rs 15,000 to the runners-up. “In the state-level, we will honour such farmers with Rs 1lakh cash prize and the runners-up with Rs 75,000 and Rs 50,000, respectively,” the chief minister said.
 
 Farmers interested in producing raw silk can approach the sericulture department and get information and suggestions from the experts, he added.
 
 In another function, Palaniswami released a souvenir to create awareness about road safety and appealed the road users to read the same and follow the rules and regulations to avoid accidents. “We have been working to curb road accidents since 2011 by constructing bridges and widening roads across the state,” he said.
 
 The chief minister also inaugurated schemes worth Rs 4.14 crore and laid foundations to 24 works worth Rs 14.40 crore in the city, besides distributing welfare measures to the tune of Rs 13.11 crore to as many as 2,078 beneficiaries.
