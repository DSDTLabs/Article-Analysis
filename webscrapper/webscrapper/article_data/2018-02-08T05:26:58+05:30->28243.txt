MUMBAI: More than two years after it was dismantled, work on construction of a new link in place of the British-era   between   and Byculla station will start a fortnight from now. 

 On Wednesday, the civic standing committee gave its approval for the bridge's construction at a cost of Rs 51 crore.
 
 The new bridge to be constructed is expected to be completed in 19 months. "Once we receive the standing committee's resolution, we will issue a work order. The topographic survey would first be undertaken to understand the area's features followed by geo-tagging. IIT-Bombay will monitor the work," said S O Kori, chief engineer (bridges). 
 
 While the contract cost is Rs 39.41 crore, the total project amount considering the expected costs could rise upto Rs 51.7 crore, said officials. Unlike the earlier bridge, the   plans to increase the new link's height. "We are doing so keeping in mind the requirements suggested by the railways," added Kori. 
 
 At the civic standing committee meet,   corporator Abhijit Samant raised a stink over the contract cost being 5.9% above normal. "When the proposal states that there would be no extra cost apart from what the BMC has estimated then why is the administration paying the contractor 5.9% more than what they have estimated," said Samant.
 
 The iconic bridge Hancock Bridge was demolished in January 2016 after which it has been mired in controversy delaying the commissioning of the construction of the new bridge. The tenders for the same were first invited in May 2016, when the BMC awarded contracts for four bridges to two parties.
