 Ravindra Kokare, sub-inspector, excise department, Pune, told TOI that the department has been patrolling areas close to highways ever since the SC banned sale of liquor on highways from April 1. “During recent raids, we have arrested 35 people and registered 31 criminal cases under the Maharashtra Prohibition Act. The suspects were found transporting liquor in a tempo, a rickshaw and another vehicle to highway areas close to locations such as Ghorpadi, Mundwa, Kondwa, Tadiwala Road, among others,” he said, adding that the total cost of the material seized was Rs 9.68 lakh.
 
 The officials said the incidence of   sale of liquor has gone up several times since the ban came into effect. “Availability of legal liquor has come down drastically in several city areas after the ban, as many retail stores had to be shut within the city limits. Hence, illegal liquor sales have begun to flourish within the city. It has been found that liquor is being stealthily sold through small ‘pan’ shacks and general stores close to highways now,” they said.
 
 The recent raid was carried out under senior officials of the excise department, including Arjun Ohol and Mohan Varde.
