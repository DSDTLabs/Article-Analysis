KOLKATA: Forty-eight-year-old  , who was behind the wheels of the bus that ran over two   on Saturday, was produced at the Bidhannagar additional judicial magistrate court on Sunday. He was charged under sections 304 and 279 IPC for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and rash driving and was remanded in eight days’ judicial custody.

 
 Samanta, a resident of Howrah’s  , has been driving for the past 27 years. On Saturday around 7am, he left for work as usual, driving the bus on the Muchighata to   route. Four hours later, everything turned into a nightmare. Around 11am, Samanta took a left at Chinrighata crossing toward Salt Lake Bypass. Before he could apply the brakes, Biswajit Buniya and Sanjay Banu, who were on a bicycle, were crushed under the wheels.
 
  said the police have not accused him of violating traffic rules. “The accident was unfortunate, but there was no signal violation by the accused. The victims were hit by the rear tyres, not the front tyres. There was no police custody prayer,” he said.
 
 Samanta’s neighbour Amal Das said: “Samanta surrendered before the police right after the accident. He has always been a responsible driver and is the only earning member of his family.”
