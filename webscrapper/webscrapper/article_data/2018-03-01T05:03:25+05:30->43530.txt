GURUGRAM:  , the bus conductor who was absolved of all charges by a city court on Wednesday in the murder of Class II boy in a Bhondsi school, is considering legal options against the Gurugram cops who had picked him up and allegedly forced him to confess to a crime he had never committed. 
 
 He alleged that he was tortured and beaten up with sticks in police custody after his arrest on September 8 last year on the charge of murder. “Even today, I have nightmares of police beating me. It was inhuman. I will ask the village elders to hold a panchayat so that they can decide the next step. I want legal action against the Gurugram police. They should be taught a lesson that poor too have a right to live,” he added. 
  
 The family at the Ghamroj village house thanked the CBI, which gave Ashok a clean chit in its charge-sheet submitted in court earlier this month paving the way for his acquittal, as well as the slain Class II boy’s father who was the one to press for a probe by the central agency. 
  
 “I want to meet the boy’s father, hold his hands and thank him. His battle has given him justice, and to me too,” Ashok added. Ashok’s mother Kela Devi said, “I knew my son cannot do what he was accused of. I’m extremely relieved now.” 
  
 His wife Mamta said now she could focus on the studies of her two sons, who are in Class I and III now. “Since September, they had been disturbed due to all that were happening. Their teachers had also complained that they were not following lessons taught in classes. Now, they can study properly.”
