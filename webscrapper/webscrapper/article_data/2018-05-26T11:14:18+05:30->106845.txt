LUCKNOW: Dr   has shut down 39 colleges affiliated to it due to poor student response to them. 

 Of these, 21 colleges are of MBA, seven each of   and MTech, three of MBA (integrated) and one of MPharma. Last month, the university had announced the closure of 27 engineering colleges due to low student intake. "Under the progressive closure scheme, the university is shutting down colleges to ensure quality education. All 39 colleges have failed to provide desired infrastructure, on-campus facilities and placements. Hence, they have failed to get students in previous years," said   spokesperson  . 
 
 On the basis of poor student response, the university has decided to not continue with these postgraduation colleges, he added. 
 
 "The reason behind closing down PG colleges is the short academic vision of these educational institutes. They focus more on opening courses and less on academic excellence that transforms a college into a brand," said dean UG Prof Vineet Kansal. 
 
 Merely opening a college with 10 classrooms can't help it to sustain unless it assures facilities like infrastructure, placements and good faculty, he added.
