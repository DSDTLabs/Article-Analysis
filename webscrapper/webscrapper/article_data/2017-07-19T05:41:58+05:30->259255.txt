CHENNAI: The Centre is making a last ditch effort to set up the India-based   (INO) in Theni by applying again for environmental clearance. While the scientist community are making desperate moves to finalise an alternate location in the next few weeks, activists are hell-bent on stalling the project.

 “We have invested a lot in this project and we have already wasted five to six years. If we get clearance, we will start working within some time. If we don’t, we will drop it,” said  , secretary, department of atomic energy told TOI. “But we are in a conflicting situation where we can neither tell the scientists’ community to stop nor able to say that we should do about it.”
 
 Clearances were given in 2010 to set up the observatory in Theni and the Union cabinet approved the project in 2015. But in March this year, the southern bench of the   suspended the environmental clearance and directed to make a fresh application.
 
 “Both to change the site and drop the project, we need clearances from higher authorities. It is a good sign that scientists have now started to look for sites through their own contacts,” Basu said.
 
 INO project director   said they would take a decision on an alternate site in less than a month while they have applied afresh for the environmental clearance. Sources said   near Narsipatnam in Vishakapatnam has emerged as an alternate site.
 
 “We are very worried we did not get the permission from TNPCB and the reclassification of the land which we ought to have got. We expected it to be a routine affair because this is a scientific observatory and not some polluting industry,” he said.
