JAIPUR: Some of the swankiest hotels within   won't be affected by the   order banning liquor within 500 metres of highways because the stretches of the three national highways on which they lie - NH-8 (MI Road), NH-11 ( ) and NH-13 (Tonk Road) - were de-notified years ago. 

  This means those portions of NH-8, NH-11 and NH-13 that run within Jaipur city limits are no longer considered NHs. As for hotels on the   highway, most will be able to operate their bars. "Most hotels on NH-8 on the outskirts of the city fall in the ambit of a panchayat, or are outside (Jaipur's) municipal limits and have populations of less than 20,000," Rajasthan excise commissioner O P Yadav said.
