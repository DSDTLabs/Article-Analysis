MARGAO: The commercial capital wore a deserted look by noon on Tuesday, as traders downed their shutters to head to Zambaulim for  , the annual festival of gulal (coloured powders) dedicated to the patron deity,  . The people of Margao ardently believe that ‘Dambab’ plays gulal with them on this auspicious day.

 As the famed ‘Zambaulecho Gulal’ got under way, it was a riot of colours amidst a sea of devotees. With fervent cries of ‘Shree Ramnath Damodar Maharaj ki jai!’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’, revellers danced in gay abandon as they flung fistfuls of gulal at the palkhi (palanquin) carrying the idol of the deity. As people smeared each others’ faces with gulal, a cloud of red enveloped the landscape.
 
 History has it that the original temple of Lord Damodar was located in the area known as ‘Madd’ in Margao, now referred to as ‘Lingakadden’, where the ancient temple tank still stands. During the 16th century conquest by the Portuguese, locals attempted to shift the Shivlinga to a safer place, but only managed to sever a part of it which they managed to move to Zambaulim, where the current temple of Shree Damodar stands. 
 
 It is in honour of  , and with a sense of gratitude to him for offering his place for Lord Damodar, that Dambab’s palkhi comes calling to the temple of Shree Ramnath, the night preceding the Gulalotsav. Suvari vadan (folk music) and cultural programmes are held here that night. Gulalotsav is celebrated the next day. 
 
 On Tuesday, Gulalotsav marked the culmination of the week-long festivities that began with the ‘holy coconut’ being brought from the house of late   in Comba, Margao, to the Damodar temple, Zambaulim, in a grand procession.
