Bengaluru: While the Congress at the national level has been persistently opposing the “over reach” of Aadhaar, chief minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday tabled a bill in the legislative assembly that makes the card mandatory for all government services, schemes and subsidies in the state.

 As per the statement of objects and reasons of the Karnataka Aadhaar (targeted delivery of financial and other subsidies, benefits and services) Bill 2018, the government has decided to make Aadhaar mandatory for “correct identification of targeted beneficiaries for delivery of various subsidies, benefits, services, grants, wages and other social benefit schemes for effective implementation of the programmes of the state government and its agencies.” 
 
 However, in the bill, while defining service, the government has said: “...and includes such other services as may be notified by the state government.”
 
 The use of Aadhaar has also been justified in the bill saying that UIDAI numbers will help in “a good governance, transparent and targeted delivery of subsidies, services and expenditure which is incurred from the consolidated fund of the state or of any agency of the state government.”
