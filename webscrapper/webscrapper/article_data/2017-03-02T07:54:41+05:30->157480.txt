THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With only a month left to announce the   for the coming fiscal, the ruling   has begun discussions on the changes to be made to the policy announced by the previous  . It is learnt that allowing partial opening of bars is being seriously debated. The existing policy only allows 5-star bars in the state. 

 Confirming that the issue came up for debate in the state secretariat three weeks ago, a senior leader said a final decision has not been taken yet. The active proposal before the policy-making body of the party is to allow 4-star bars in tourism centres to open in addition to existing 5-star bars. The reasoning to be cited will be the loss suffered by tourism industry following the closure of bars.
 
 Also, there will be more relaxation in giving one-day permits for organising parties which will be dubbed as an attempt to save MICE sector which has faced a setback.
 
 Meanwhile, CPM state secretary   denied the reports that the CPM secretariat has made some suggestions on the excise policy. "The LDF is to take a decision on the issue. The LDF meeting to be held by the end of March will discuss the issue. We will discuss the issue in the secretariat meeting prior to the LDF meeting," said Kodiyeri.
 
 The CPM is also waiting for a confirmation from legal sources on the impact of the recent   order on closing down liquor outlets along national and state highways.
 
 Sources also indicated that a drastic restructuring of the existing policy was not practical as the LDF is afraid of public backlash. "The policy will revolve around promoting light liquor like beer/wine and toddy while trying to reduce consumption of hard liquor," said an LDF leader.
