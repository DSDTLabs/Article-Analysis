English actor   visited India when he was a child, and says he saw poverty, hardship and sickness in the country.

 The actor, who has a host of shows and films to his name, hopes things have changed since then.
 
 "I was in India when I was eight years old. My mother was living with a holy man somewhere in the mountains. And I have not been to India since then," Weber told IANS.
 
 His memories of the country are rather grim.
 
 "I remember, as a child and I hope it is very different now, but as a child I remember there was a lot of visible poverty, hardship and sickness and people on the streets. It was very sad," he added.
