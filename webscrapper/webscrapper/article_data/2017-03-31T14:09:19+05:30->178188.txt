 : The Great Father is a Malayalam film directed by Haneef Adeni and produced by Prithviraj Sukumaran, Arya, Santhosh Sivan, and Shaji Nadesan under the banner of August Cinema. Starring Mammooty in the lead role and Arya, Sneha and Shaam in supporting roles.
 
 
 The film is 2 hour 31 minutes-long, and the first half rides high on Mammootty's character's good looks, as a heroic halo is created by daughter out of sheer adulation and love. Tamil actor Arya gets a good share of action to perform as the stylish cop Andrews. 
  
 
 
  Say a daddy-daughter film and it’s sure to raise some expectations of a few ‘papa’s little girl’ scenes, cute moments of laughter and enough to get one misty-eyed triggering your own parallel experiences. Just like its teaser indicated, Mammootty’s The Great Father is no different. Part-endearing and part-heroic, it’s the tale of a dad who goes to the bravest extent to bring justice to his daughter.
