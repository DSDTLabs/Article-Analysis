NAGPUR: Using music as a platform to garner support for philanthropic causes was the event ‘Dil Ke Jharoke Se’, organized by Kalpataru Society at   on Sunday evening. A stage full of musicians and singers set the tone for an evening filled with melody and entertainment as popular city singers and upcoming ones belted out more than twenty hits of Bollywood films of fifties, sixties and seventies.

 The cause was to raise funds for the   run by the organization for underprivileged children suffering with congenital heart diseases. The city audience turned out in good numbers to raise funds. The musical concert put up by ‘Swar Symphony Group’ had more than twenty musicians and four singers. 
 
 Presenting the songs of Kishore Kumar was   who regaled the audience with hits like ‘Mai aaya huoon’, ‘O Hansini’, ‘Tujhse naaraz nahi zindagi’ and the peppy ‘Zindagi ek safar hai suhana’. Akanksha Nagarkar, winner of a Marathi music reality show, impressed with songs like ‘Dil cheez kya hai’, ‘Piya bawari’ and ‘Hoton pe aisi baat’. But it was Mukul Pande the voice of Mohd Rafi who impressed with his robust rendition of songs like ‘Jahan daal daal pe’ and ‘Dil ke jharoke se’. Sanjay Potdukhe’s rendition of ‘Tum jo mil gaye ho’ was impressive.
 
 “Kalpataru works as a bridge between society and underprivileged children of all communities. Our effort is to create a space where these children can get direct medical treatment. Our effort is to also provide them sound health and human values through our structured programmes,” founder of the society Jiten Pradhan told TOI.
 
 Funds raised through the musical show will be used for treatment of children with congenital heart ailments, who have already been identified and shortlisted by the organization.
 
 With many upcoming singers performing, the concert was short on the sheen and a perfect coordination with musicians which is the true measure of such shows. But the cause behind the event gave it the required glitter.
