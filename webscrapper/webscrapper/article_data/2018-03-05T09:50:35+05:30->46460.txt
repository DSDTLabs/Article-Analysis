VADODARA: M S University - Gujarat’s only English medium university - might be patting itself on its back after receiving ‘A’ grade from the   (NAAC) – the national-level body that assesses and accreditates all higher education institutes in the country. 

 But in reality not even five per cent of its total student strength, which has crossed 40,000 mark, had received campus placement last year. 
 
 Data provided by MSU officials to government nominated syndicate member Dr Ashok Mehta suggests that in 2017  ,567 students got campus placement in MSU - Central Gujarat’s largest publicly funded university. 
 
 Ironically, the university officials have shared just this number with Mehta, who had sought information regarding the scenario of campus placements in December last year. 
 
 Mehta had to wait for two months before the university officials provided the total number of campus placements done last year. 
 
 Also, the government nominated syndicate member has not received any faculty-wise break-up of the campus placements or campus interviews held across the university which has 14 faculties and nearly 100 departments functioning under its umbrella. 
 
 The concerns regarding poor placement scenario of graduating students isn’t new on the campus given the fact that several student outfits had made representations demanding that the university have a centralized system to collaborate with industries to improve its placement record or make students industry ready. 
 
 Although there are individual faculties, which run or manage their own placement cells, as the data itself reveals, a concentrated effort to improve the placement scenario is still missing on the campus.
