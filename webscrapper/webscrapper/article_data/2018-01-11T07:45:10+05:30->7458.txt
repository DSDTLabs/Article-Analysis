CHENNAI: Have you ever been awed at how a single composer working on a mixer, tucked away in an air-conditioned studio, can often end up creating some of the world’s most iconic sounds? A new initiative by the British Council gives you a sneak peek into the process.

 ‘Mix the City’ (MTC), an interactive   platform that amalgamates artists and their sounds, was launched in Chennai on January 10. Backing up the music are vibrant motion shots of everyday life from Chennai, which shares the portal with nine other cities around the world.
 
 “It’s an app that lets you create music videos, shot in some of the most iconic locations in the city, which you can share on social media,” says  ,   of  .
 
 MTC Chennai brings together 12 artists from the city contributing their own unique sounds to the platform which users can incorporate into their videos. They include AK Palanivel (thavil), Saroja Ganapathy (dilruba), Sean Roldan (electric guitar), Prakash Hariharan (mandolin), Anil Srinivasan (piano), Padma Shankar (violin), Rajhesh Vaidya (veena), Runa Rizvi (vocals) and Paul Jacob (bass guitar). 
 
 “They said I could play Carnatic and they would use four bars out of whatever I played. So, now there’s authentic Kalyani playing from my violin that sounds great no matter what it is mixed with,” says Shankar.
