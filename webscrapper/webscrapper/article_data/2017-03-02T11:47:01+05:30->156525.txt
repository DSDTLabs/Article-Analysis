SONBHADRA: In a veiled reference to PM Narendra Modi, BSP chief Mayawati said on Tuesday that people of Uttar Pradesh have decided to send the “adopted son” back to Gujarat and hand over the reins of power to their very own daughter.

 She also termed the BJP as the “Bharatiya Jumla Party”. “The people of Uttar Pradesh have made up their minds to send the adopted son back to Gujarat and give the mandate to their very own daughter,” Mayawati said at an election rally here.
 
 Stating that the BJP stood for “Bharatiya Jumla Party”, she claimed that it had not honoured any of its promises such as bringing back black money and depositing Rs 15 lakh each in the bank accounts of the common people.
 
 “He (Modi) had also promised to waive the loans of the poor, but has not honoured any of them,” she alleged, adding that when the PM failed to keep his promises, the currency ban was implemented “to divert the attention of the people”.
 
 Attacking chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati said his uncle (SP leader Shivpal Yadav) was enough to set right the “babua” of the Samajwadi Party.
