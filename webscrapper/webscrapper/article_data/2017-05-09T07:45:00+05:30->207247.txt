GURGAON: A reward of Rs 2 lakh has been offered by the owner of a dog, who went   on Sunday after it allegedly ran away from Bella’s Pawcuzzi, a dog grooming service centre at Rodeo Drive. 

 The dog, Rexy, is a six-month-old Indian breed, whose colouring is 90% white with patches of brown on his face and body. “Around 15 minutes after I dropped Rexy, I received a call from them saying my dog had chewed through his leash and run away,” said  , the dog owner. “He hasn’t been trained to go up and down the stairs, but the store owners claim he ran down from the first floor and crossed one of the busiest streets,” he said. A complaint was filed at Sector 50 police station. Apart from speaking to the CEO of TFA For Animals, Green has also registered a case on ‘ilostmydog.in’.
 
 Rexy was adopted in October 2016, from a shelter that rescues street dogs and operates out of Select City Walk, Saket, every Saturday.
