Bhopal: Eleven students, aged 7 to 10 years, suffered burn injuries after their school van caught fire in Gwalior on Friday morning. Passersby helped rescue the kids in the nick of time as some of them had their bags and uniform in flames. All of them are reported out of danger.

 On Thursday morning, the van of St. Joseph school, Piproli, with 12 students on board was on its way to drop them home when the fire broke out, say police. It’s suspected that the LPG tank blew up as soon as driver Lakhan turned the key in the ignition near   area. Lakhan jumped out and immediately opened all the doors to help the students exit. In seconds, fire had engulfed most of the vehicle, a  , but passersby raced to the rescue.
 
 Firemen doused the flames. Parents rushed to the hospital where the children were taken and were relived to see them alive. Senior police officials and school authorities also went to the hospital to meet students. Police took down the driver’s statement. They say he was operating the van on an unauthorised LPG kit despite strong warnings from the administration. Parents staged a protest, demanding strong action against the van driver and close monitoring of vehicles used to ferry students.
 
 “Thankfully, none of the children suffered any major injury. I have ordered an inquiry,” Gwalior collector Rahul Jain told TOI. The narrow escape has again brought to the fore dangers faced by schoolchildren as they travel by unregistered private vehicles. After the January 5 DPS bus tragedy, in which four children were killed, the government promised tighter monitoring of such vehicles but after the initial road checks, it’s petered out.
