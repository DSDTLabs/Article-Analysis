DALTONGANJ: A meeting called on Monday in   district's   block, 40 kms from here, to discuss opening of a degree college in Manika saw   (NPU) vice-chancellor S N Singh leaving the venue in a huff as there was no one present to attend the meet on time. 

  who hosted the meeting and other functionaries, including  , were not present at the venue for nearly one hour after the scheduled time.
 
 "I got a mail from the Latehar DC inviting me to attend the meeting on Monday at the Manika block office and accordingly I reached here at 11 am sharp as it was the scheduled time of the start of the meeting but even after more than 50 minutes, there was no one around, so I decided to return to  ," the vice-chancellor said. 
 
 Sources said the meeting was conducted later without the NPU vice-chanchellor. NPU is the affiliating authority of colleges and Manika comes under the university's territorial jurisdiction.
 
 On January 9, the DC wrote a letter to Manika BJP MLA Hareykrishan Singh and the NPU V-C to attend the meeting.
 
 Later,   said 'The meeting was to start at 11 am. I waited for the DC Latehar to join. I am confident NPU V-C would be kind enough to accept our resolution on the start of the degree college."
 
 DC P K   also told TOI, "I got an urgent meeting and hence the delay. Nevertheless, we will seek the co-operation of the V-C for the start of the college." 
 
 So far, Manika block has no degree college and the Latehar administration is ready to start the first-ever degree college in a government building and is looking forward to NPU to provide teachers, non-teaching staff and other academic activities.
 
 Sources said the state government has granted more than Rs 54 lakh to start the degree college.
 
 On providing faculty members and non-teaching staff of the college, the V-C said, "It requires a serious deliberation and off hand, I cannot make any commitment."
