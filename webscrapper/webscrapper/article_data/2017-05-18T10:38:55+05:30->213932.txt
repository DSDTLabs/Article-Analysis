 Another person identified as Ajay Paswan was lured by the advertisement and paid Rs 25,000 after having paid Rs 5,000 for registration but when he got another call from an unknown number asking him for more cash, Paswan then lodged a complaint on May 15. A similar complaint was lodged by Anand, a resident of Narhi for the same website on May 16. 
 
 Sub-inspector V S  , told TOI police had received three complains about the fake website and preliminary investigations revealed that it is hosted by ‘Go daddy’. When TOI, asked about the previous cases the officer said a probe was underway.
 
 He added the original website for obtaining the dealership is www.pmujjwalayojana.com.
