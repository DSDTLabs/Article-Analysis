THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the Supreme Court-appointed panel to oversee the MCI's functioning giving its approval for the   course at the medical college at Parippally, the state will have 100 more medical seats for the coming academic year. 

 The   (MCI) had barred the college from enrolling students since it lacked adequate infrastructure and faculty.
 
 "The government has received the committee's approval to admit students against the 100 MBBS seats for 2017-18. But it has to address the issues pointed out by the MCI within 15 days of the notification,'' said N K Premachandran, Kollam MP, who had approached the committee, headed by headed by Justice R M Lodha, protesting against the MCI's decision.
 
  The state government will have to submit a written undertaking to the MCI that all the deficiencies will be rectified within the stipulated time.
 
  The committee has warned that otherwise, it would review the recognition.
 
 During the tenure of the previous UDF government the MCI team had conducted an inspection and rejected the proposal citing faculty shortage.
 
  After the   came to power it transferred doctors from Thiruvananthapuram and assured the council that the facilities will be improved within one year. 
 
 But the MCI did not accept the proposal.
 
 It was in this backdrop that Kollam MP approached the   with a review petition seeking permission to enrol students from this year. 
 
 "If the government does not rectify the deficiencies we will lose the seats in the next year," said Premachandran.
