AHMEDABAD:  , a suspected Indian Mujahideen (IM) operative and   of the   — who was nabbed from Gaya by the   with Gulam Sarvar on Thursday — had plans to devastate Bihar, say cops. While Gaya Police is in the process of lodging a complaint under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) it has come to light that Pathan and Sarvar of Gaya were conspiring launch targeted killings and also to trigger a blast at a temple in Gaya.

  “We have found some documents which reveal their plan to regroup as IM cadre,” said a senior Gujarat ATS official. Some Gujarat ATS and crime branch officials are in Gaya to take custody of Pathan. They are expected to return once the FIR under sections of the UAPA is filed against the duo. Gujarat Police officials said that Sarvar had been on their radar since July 2010 when they arrested Hasib Raza of Azamgarh just days before the Jagannath Rath Yatra.
 
 “We could not arrest him at the time because we had no evidence. Raza had revealed to us that a key IM operative, Abdul Subhan alias Taukeer, had contacted Sarvar for shelter, ” said a senior Gujarat ATS official. 
 
 “However as Sarvar denied him shelter, Raza had volunteered to hide Taukeer. Later Taukeer fled towards Nepal.”
 
 Crime branch officials said they have found documents which suggest that Pathan and Sarvar planned to free alleged IM operatives lodged in different jails across the country. “We suspect that Pathan had a hand in the infamous February 2013 jailbreak attempt by 24 IM terror suspects lodged at the Sabarmati Jail in Ahmedabad,” said a senior police official.
 
 The 24 prisoners had dug a 213 feet tunnel from their barrack to the outer wall of the jail. Fortunately the tunnel was discovered. “We have found a diary in which there is mention of a forthcoming meeting to discuss ways and means to free their associates lodged in jails,” the official said.
