 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar sought the AAP government's stand on the plea which also wants that the term `senior citizen' to include parents who have not yet attained that status as they are below 60 years of age.
 
 The court directed that the petitioner be given police protection when he visits his house where he has not been staying as he apprehended threat to his life at the hands of his 34-year-old younger son.
 
 The bench sought a status report from the police by November 27 on the man's allegations against his son.

 Rawat, represented by advocate Ashok Agarwal, also said that while he was ho spitalised after the assault, his son broke into the house and forcibly occupied it.
 
 In his plea, Rawat has said that he does not want any maintenance from his son, but only wants to live in peace.

The petition has sought striking down of the provision in the Act which creates the distinction between parents who are senior citizens and those who are not.
 
 He said the Act does not contain any provision to meet the needs of persons like him, who do not seek any maintenance from their children.
 
 He has also contended that such people need to be protected from hostile and violent children who are only interested in grabbing the properties of their parents and do not care how much suffering they cause.
