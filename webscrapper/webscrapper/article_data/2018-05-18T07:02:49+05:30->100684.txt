MARGAO: The   Municipal Council’s ( ) multi-level pay   project, which was caught in a GST tangle after the contractor refused to accept the work order until his tax burden was waived off, continues to be grounded as the municipality still hasn’t been able to get its GST calculations right. 

 Following the controversy, the MMC had referred the project to the PWD for advice on calculation of GST around four months back. The PWD returned the file to the MMC, providing it with the necessary guidance on the rate of GST on each tendered item. 
 
 While the MMC worked out the tax component for each item and sent the file back to the PWD for approval, the latter found errors in the calculations and sent the file back to the civic body to rectify the errors, MMC sources said. As the file keeps shuttling between the two bodies, the Rs 6.5 crore project lies tied up in knots. 
 
 MMC chairperson Babita Angle Prabhudessai admitted that the delay in GST calculations has further delayed the project. 
 
 The multi-level pay parking, to be built on an area of nearly 5,000 sqm, will comprise a basement and six floors. The topmost floor will house the pay parking maintenance unit, which will be set up by MMC. All other floors will provide parking facility for 113 four-wheelers. There is also a provision for parking 42 two-wheelers. 
 
 Significantly, the Rs 3 crore that the MMC received from the government as golden jubilee grant on the occasion of the state’s 50th year of liberation in 2011 will be utilised for the project. The remainder of the amount will be sourced from unutilized grants the MMC has in its coffers.
