JAIPUR:   who stop in the middle of the road, abuse motorists and often hit other vehicles, are all set to feel the   as special drive has been launched to bring rowdy drivers to book. 

 The city police's action comes three days after a speeding mini bus ran over an 8-year-old girl near  . The cops had found that the accused driver was driving beyond permissible limit in order to reach the next stop ahead of other buses. Traffic wardens have been directed to issue challans and seize the licenses of offenders.
 
 "Traffic wardens will be carrying out checking in the city to nab drivers who flout norms. Also, we would be keeping a check on their rowdy behaviour with the help of our newly opened control centre with the help of CCTVs," said police commissioner  .
 
 PCR vans and interceptor vehicles will be deployed across Tonk Road, Narain Singh Circle and Khasa Kothi. The sources said that if these heavy vehicles cause accidents, their licenses would also been seized. The police said that cracking a whip on drivers had been an uphill task due to strong political backing they enjoy.
 
  "The bus which first arrives at a bus stand gets away with maximum passengers. Hence, the bus drivers try to outdo each other and in result ram into other vehicles," a traffic police official said. 
 
  Near Khasa Kothi and  , the chaos unleashed by the bus drivers is often life-threatening. For instance, a mini-bus in order to outpace a low-floor bus ahead of it often rams into cars, bikes and auto-rickshaws. 
 
  The Jaipur police have also spoken to the officials of Jaipur RTO and JCTSL, "We have spoken to the officials and asked them take actions against the drivers who don't comply with rules," commissioner told TOI .
