Days ahead of the visit, official sources said, the state highways department roped in workers to repaint dividers and the median near south zone cultural centre close to Rahuman Nagar while Thanjavur corporation workers were seen cleaning roads. 
 
 Residents along the   said if not for the high profile visit, the road would have remained the same. "Though we are happy that medians were painted at least now. If governor had not come to Thanjavur, it would not have happened," A Faiz, resident of Medical College Road told TOI.
