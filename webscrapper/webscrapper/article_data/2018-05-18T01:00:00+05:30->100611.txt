No one expected an ‘R’ rated superhero like   to be such a rage. But the ‘Merc with a mouth’ always had a great personality and a brazen attitude. The ‘Deadpool’ movies have been able to play out the character’s irreverence to great effect, with   fitting into the mould of the character like he was born to play the part. Talking about the lineage, Ryan says, “I think one of the reasons that ‘Deadpool’ resonated so well with the audience was because it was a labour of love. We had so much fun making it that I think it comes across in ‘Deadpool 2’ even more so than the first one, because this time, we weren’t tasked with the often-difficult enterprise of telling an original story, where much of what you’re doing is expositional. In ‘Deadpool 2’, we don’t need to explain where he’s come from and why he is the way he is, as much. You can remind the audience of all those things just by the way he interacts with the people around him.”

 The first ‘Deadpool’ movie turned out to be a hit. It didn’t have a major fan following and yet, it really surprised viewers and comic book fans. It’s also got a cult following in India. Ryan Reynolds has a huge fan base and he’s super popular on social media too, but to make it to more relevant to India, the production house decided to rope in   for the Hindi dub of ‘Deadpool 2’. Talking about it, Ranveer says, “Deadpool immediately became my favourite when I saw the first film. I had not seen or experienced a superhero like this before. He is a real badass and definitely my favourite. A lot of people have observed that my personality is a lot like Deadpool’s. I think his brand of humour matches mine.”
