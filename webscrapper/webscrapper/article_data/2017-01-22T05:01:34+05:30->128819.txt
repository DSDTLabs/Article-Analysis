CHENNAI: There has not been much progress with regard to the rights of children in the past 10-15 years, said Justice   of the  . This, he added, stood out starkly when compared to the progress of women empowerment in the same period. 

 Addressing a national conference on women and children organised by the Madras high court and the   here on Saturday, he said, "the plight of the children has been more or less the same for the past 10 to 15 years despite amendments made to children's right laws."
 
 In case of women, the legal basis with regard to their empowerment in various fields, including entry to mosques and temples, had taken some shape, he said. A change had occured in the mindset of policymakers and society, he said.
 
 But, little had taken place with regard to children despite enactment and amendment of various laws. The area neglected most is rights of children in observation homes and the way they have to be looked after, Justice Lokur said. 
 
 Potential trouble lay in social media and cyber space, he said, pointing to the lack of control over technology to prevent damage. 
 
 "We have to see whether there is a mechanism to control this. Some people say social media is a wonderful platform. There are also stories that some websites are hacked by persons from outside the country," Describing Tamil Nadu as a place for change, he said, "let the change start from here." Chief Justice  , in his presidential address, said, "unless we are able enforce laws and see their implementation at the ground level, creation of those laws itself will not be useful."
