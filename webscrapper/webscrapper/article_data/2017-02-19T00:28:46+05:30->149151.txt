NAVI MUMBAI: A new   will be opened next week at   to address the increasing demand for   and animals in the city.

 The shelter will be operated by Bhumi Jeevdaya Samvardhan Trust, which has treated more than 9,000 birds and animals and are now expanding their services. With a team of volunteers and ambulance services to pick up and transport injured animals, they hope to make the shelter accessible to all. This centre is bigger than their existing service and facilities offered will be on a much larger scale.
 
 Since the inception of the trust, volunteers have been diligently treating injured or sick birds and animals free of charge. Trustee Sagar Savla said that rising number of such incidences and lack of facilities prompted the trust to open a bigger and better clinic. “This new centre will have an operation theatre as well,” he said.
 
 The new clinic is located on the first floor in the marble market at Turbhe. 
 
 “Our aim is to start a  , the biggest in the state. We are hoping to get land from Cidco to go ahead with our project,” added Savla..
