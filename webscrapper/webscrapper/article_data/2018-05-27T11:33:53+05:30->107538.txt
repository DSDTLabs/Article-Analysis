COIMBATORE: A 46-year-old woman was allegedly attacked by the aides of a money lender from whom her husband had borrowed Rs 10 lakh by pledging their house at   in   on Thursday.

 The victim, who was alone at the house when the goons allegedly thrashed her, has been admitted to the   and Hospital (CMCH) with head injuries. Her husband R Nataraj, 54, a former textile exporter, said the police were not willing to register an FIR based on his complaint.
 
 Nataraj said he had borrowed Rs 10 lakh from B Murugaiyan of Karur in 2008 by pledging his house as surety. “I didn’t default on interest till 2010. In June 2012, Murugaiyan forged documents and registered the house in his name. I filed a civil suit before the munsif court in December that year,” he said and added that the case was scheduled to come for hearing on June 7.
 
 “As my side is strong, Murugaiyan sent his men on Thursday and attacked my wife N Jayanthi, 46, who was alone at the house as I was in Coimbatore. She sustained head injuries. She was first admitted to the Tirupur government hospital and later she was shifted to CMCH,” Natarajan said.
 
 When contacted, Murugaiyan denied his involvement in the incident. 
 
 Police, meanwhile, said they were inquiring into the issue. “We are trying to verify Natarajan’s claims as we have not found any supportive evidence so far,” said a police official.
