CHENNAI: It may have been a shrewd call by the OPS faction to take 'electric pole' as symbol in  , given its uncanny resemblance to the 'two leaves' symbol of the parent party. With the faction going to town with its literal translation in Tamil, "Irattai Vilakku" (Two lamps) and "Irattai Minkambam" (Two electric poles), T T V Dhinakaran, the AIADMK ( ) candidate in  , is a worried man. 

 In his complaint to the   on Monday, Sasikala's nephew sought action against the O Panneerselvam (OPS) camp, saying his rival   was misusing the allotted symbol intentionally to mislead voters. Their intention is mala fide, Dhinakaran said, submitting proof of screenshots of "OPSforCM," the official web page of the OPS faction.
