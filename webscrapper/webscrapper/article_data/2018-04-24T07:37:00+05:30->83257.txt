FAZILKA: Peeved over water scarcity due to suspension of canal water supply owing to maintenance, residents of several villages falling under Fazilka district disrupted traffic near Ghallu village on the   national highway for a few hours on Sunday. They lifted the road blockade only after police and higher officials of the canal department assured them of cleaning canals and restoration of water supply soon.

 Protesting the shortage of water, hundreds of residents of Ghallu, Khippawali,   and several adjoining villages while blocking the national highway said the period of canal closure was approaching but so far it has not been cleaned by the department. “Under the present circumstances we will be facing acute water shortage in the coming days,” they added. Baljinder Singh, a farmer of Ghallu village, said that as per the given time-table of the department, water in the canals would be released on April 30 but as their cleaning had not done by the department, the villages situated at the tail-end feared that they won’t be getting sufficient water in the canal to irrigate the cotton crop.
 
 Another farmer of Azamwala village said that the canal department should arrange labour from other sources as most of the labourers enrolled under MGNREGA were over-aged and not capable of cleaning the canal.
 
 Mukhtiar Singh, executive engineer of the canal department, said that as per directions of the state government, MGNREGA labour were to be hired to clean canals but villages were not supplying the labour as they were busy in harvesting. He added that keeping in view the resentment of farmers he would pursue the department to hire JCB machines to clean Ghallu minor canal. Only after the official concerned gave an assurance, the villagers lifted the road blockade.
