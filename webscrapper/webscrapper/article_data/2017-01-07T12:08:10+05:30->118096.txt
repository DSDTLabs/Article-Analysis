PANAJI: Police filed a chargesheet on Friday in the   before the   (JMFC), Mapusa, and charged former   with murder, robbery and rape of the perfume researcher.

 The 39-year-old perfume researcher was found dead in her rented flat in Sangolda on October 6, 2016. She was found naked with her hands tied to the bed. The murder came to light when Ghurde’s maid came to work at her house. When Ghurde did not open the door, the maid alerted a neighbour and Ghurde’ family. Later, Ghurde’s neighbour, an American woman, who had a set of duplicate keys, opened the flat and found the body.
 
 Singh, who is now in judicial custody, told police he had killed Monika thinking that he had lost his job after Monika complained against him. Monika had complained to the security agency that her umbrella was stolen by Singh.
 
 Singh told police that he had undressed Ghurde to film her in the nude after smothering her with the intention of later blackmailing her to remain silent. After that, he went into the kitchen, boiled two eggs and ate them, thinking she would wake up. 
 
 But, when Ghurde was still ‘unconscious’, he realised that she had died. He immediately fled from the spot.
 
 Police had zeroed in on Singh after checking CCTV footage of a Porvorim ATM and arrested him on October 9, 2016 from a Bengaluru hotel.
