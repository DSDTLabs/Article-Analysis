Auteur   has always been known for identifying talent. The latest one being introduced by him is Coorg lass and former   finalist  . “This was a surreal experience. I got a call from Mani Ratnam’s production house, during which they asked me to send pictures. I had to figure out if it was genuine and once verified, I sent the pictures. I didn’t hear from them for long. Three months later, I got a call asking me to audition in Mumbai. Once I did and my video was sent to Mani sir, he asked me to fly down to Chennai for another video test. This time, I was given a different set of lines. He was impressed how I could pick the language and the lines, despite not being from Chennai. I explained how living in Bengaluru had me knowing many languages and that I can converse in Tamil and Malayalam too. A few days later, I was informed that I’d bagged a role in his film. I thought it would be a small role and was thrilled at getting the experience of working with a filmmaker like him. But when they announced the film saying they are introducing me, I realized that I was one of the leads,” says Dayana, who has already undergone a workshop for the film. She is slated to begin shooting in March. “There couldn’t have been a better launch pad in films. I’d never thought of a career in films like this, but I’m nervous too, as it will be a brand new journey all over again,” she says, adding that she is eagerly waiting to meet her co-stars and begin work.
