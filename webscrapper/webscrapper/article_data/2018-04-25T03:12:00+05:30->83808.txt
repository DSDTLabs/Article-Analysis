Nagpur: A massive loan scam has come to fore, with seven cases of fraud being registered against 12 people, for duping a private sector bank of Rs2.63 crore between July 2015 and April 2016. Imambada police have lodged a FIR against 12 people on Monday following primary investigations, after an application from bank officials. A Hanuman Nagar-based private sector bank had started a scheme ‘Shubgruh Housing Loan’ for providing loans to people endeavouring to buy flats. Several people had applied for loans, and the bank had sanctioned some applications. However, the 12 accused in the case had applied for loans with fake documents.

Cops were provided over 1,500 documents to scrutinize at the end of January. Following primary investigation into the matter, the cops booked 12 people.
