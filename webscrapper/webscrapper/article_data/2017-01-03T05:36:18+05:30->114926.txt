AHMEDABAD: The face value of fake notes deposited in banks has dropped considerably in the last three months of 2016, including the period after demonetization.

 According to the FIR registered by special operations group (SOG) of city crime branch, fake currency with a face value of Rs 68.46 lakh — in demonetized notes and legal tender — were deposited in 15 banks in the city in the months of October, November and December, 2016. The same figure for July to September was Rs 1.60 crore.
 
 Deputy commissioner of crime branch   said the figure may have come down due to the various regulatory stages the money has to pass through after demonetization.
 
 “Moreover, the increased use of plastic money and cashless transactions could be the reason for the fall in illegal circulation of fake currency notes in the market,” he added.
 
 According to assistant commissioner of police (SOG) B C Solanki, the fake currency notes were deposited in 16 banks manually and through deposit machines were in denominations of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 along with Rs 100, 50, 20 and 10.
 
 “Banks submitted 4,766 fake Rs 1,000 notes, 3,859 fake Rs 500 notes, 1,505 notes of Rs 100, 17 of Rs 50 and one each of Rs 20 and Rs 10 to us,” added Solanki.
 
 Not a single accused responsible for depositing fake notes has been traced or arrested so far. “This time round we are following leads from CCTV footage and deposit slips to trace the accused,” added  .
 
 Every two or three months, FIRs are lodged against unknown persons for depositing fake notes in banks. “We are also going to question accused previously booked for alleged possession of fake currency to get leads,” added a senior SOG official.
