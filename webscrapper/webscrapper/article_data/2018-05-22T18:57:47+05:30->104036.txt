NEW DELHI: For diesel and petrol, it's a record a day every day now. On Saturday, petrol touched the all-time high price since 2013. On Sunday, it beat its previous day’s record. On Monday, 
  by touching Rs 76.57 and Rs 84.40, respectively.

 
 
 
 Production cuts by oil exporters, shrinking supplies from   and uncertainty over Iran’s contribution after 
  have contributed to rise in crude prices.
 
 However, there is a catch. The government might be blaming crude prices for record high petrol and diesel rates, but the last time petrol crossed 76 per litre, five years ago, it was 40 per cent costlier before taxes. 
 
 Fuel prices have shot up now because of very high taxes. Central tax on diesel has increased more than three-fold, and it has doubled in case of petrol. In 2016-17, the Centre earned 2.7 lakh crore from taxes and duties on petroleum products, which is 117 per cent higher than the 1.3 lakh crore it earned in 2014-15, when NDA came to power.

 Oil minister   has indicated that there is scope for relief. On Sunday he said, "The Centre is sensitive towards the rising fuel prices. Various alternatives are being explored. I hope something will work out soon."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Most fuel taxes are as percentage of price which means government’s tax earning goes up as price increases. The 
  while it cut the tax just once in October last year. 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 The bottomline thus is, Centre does not have to take a hit on revenue, it just has to be okay with not earning more with every hike. If not, then the next relief may be six months away when the next round of elections is due.
