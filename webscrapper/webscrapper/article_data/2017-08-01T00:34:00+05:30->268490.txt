Panaji: The salvage operations to extricate grounded vessel MV Lucky Seven may have to wait till the next spring tide on August 7, as the draft at high tide is inadequate to tow away the ship. The ship which was being brought into River Mandovi, despite warnings about the sand bar obstacle on the river mouth, had hit the barrier and later ran aground at Miramar beach on July 16 this year. The Tanzanian flagship vessel was to be used as a casino. The weather conditions have improved with the sea calmer than in mid-July when choppy conditions with wind speeds ranging from 25km per hour to more than 50km per hour slammed the vessel on the sandy beach.  “The ship needs a draft of at least one-and-half-metres and the salvaging operations will have to wait till the next spring tide on August 7,” an official source said. The grounded vessel has become an attraction for tourists and locals alike. While it will continue to be a landmark for at least a week, the beach is likely to continue to undergo more erosion.  After a week of the vessel’s presence on the beach, the southern side of the stretch towards Caranzalem suffered erosion on a roughly 100m stretch. Experts have said that the beach morphology will largely restore naturally if the ship is towed away soon. On Monday, the scene was quiet near the vessel, with the special excavator which was earlier dredging a water channel having been shifted from the spot near the vessel.
