  has taken the   to Delhi rather than opting for a flight, sources close to the MP told TOI on Monday. 

 “It is confirmed that he took the Rajdhani Express to Delhi. He has already reached the country’s capital and had called me to confirm it. The train leaves from   in Mumbai and stops at   too. I am not sure whether he boarded the train from Mumbai Central or Borivali. He will be staying in Delhi until the Parliament session is over. He might take some days more and then come back,”  , a close aid of the MP told TOI.
 
 With the two-week air 
  after the intervention of the ministry of civil aviation last week, Gaikwad had taken the Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani Express to reach Mumbai from Delhi last week. 
 
 “At that time he already had a confirmed train ticket and hence he traveled by train. This time, there were four to five people traveling with him and hence he chose to take the train again. He isn’t trying to avoid flying after whatever happened. Everything related to that incident is over and has been fixed. There is no point discussing it again and again,” Shinde said.
