Ever wondered what could be the secret behind Amala Paul’s dewy skin and toned body? Well, it looks like it’s yoga. The actress has posted a video of herself doing a smooth headstand amidst greener and boy, isn’t she flexible! Also seen is her pet dog, winter, in the video. 

  Amala has added a note to the video which says:
 "Yoga begins right where I am - not where I was yesterday or where I long to be"
 This is what takes me to the yoga mat everyday no matter how hard I feel about it some days. I have been struggling hard in achieving   (headstand) as my upper body is weaker compared to the lower. I was able to do it with the help of my teachers or with the support of the wall but I realised that without getting out of my comfort zone I am never going to achieve this pose. So I started practising on my own. It was hard, stressing, fell many times but all I knew was I am building my upper body strength and today in the lap of mother nature, I surrendered. She carried me in to the asana beautifully without any struggle. I felt a flow in my body, a moment of stillness in my mind, being alive and one with my breath and nature. I stood there, not on my feet, but on my head for I don’t remember how long and when I came back on my feet, I had tears in my eyes, the true joy of ecstasy and I jumped around in the park with winter like a child who found her magic. ❤️''
 
 Well, way to go, Amala!
