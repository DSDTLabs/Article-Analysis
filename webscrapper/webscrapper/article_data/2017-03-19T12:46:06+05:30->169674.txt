Mapusa: As uncertainty prevails over the portfolios to be allotted to ministers, chief minister   met two ministers of the Goa Forward party (GFP) at their respective residences.

 Sources said that Parrikar took into confidence Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar and Siolim MLA   on the portfolios that they are likely to be allotted on Monday. The two ministers, who were sworn in as part of the 10-member council of ministers on Tuesday, are first time MLAs. Salgaonkar defeated then tourism minister Dilip Parulekar while Palyekar ended the rule of three-term MLA and water resources minister  .
 
 A source in the BJP said that the chief minister has been meeting his ministerial colleagues to work out modalities of the ministries to be allotted to them.
 
 In Siolim, Palyekar has asked the police to ensure that no loud music is played beyond 10pm. He has also directed them to ensure that no establishment plays loud music late night as it disturbs students during examination time and senior citizens, too. Playing loud music was common in the constituency for over a decade.
 
 With an undercurrent of resentment visible in the BJP, the chief minister is learnt to have also met two party MLAs who are aspirants for ministerial berths.
 
 Now, with only two berths left to be filled, only one is likely to go to a BJP legislator as   who resigned from the Congress two days ago is almost certain of getting inducted in the cabinet, sources said.
 
 The placating of alliance partners â€“ MGP, GFP and independents, for reasons of stability, has left some BJP members fuming. In a tight rope walk, the chief minister is trying to assuage the feelings of his party men, sources said.
