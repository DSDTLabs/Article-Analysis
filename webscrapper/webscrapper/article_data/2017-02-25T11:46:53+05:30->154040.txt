Shivaay is able to take the necklace off Tia's neck. He puts it in a wine glass which is then picked up by Rumi. Later, Tia realizes that the necklace is missing from her neck. This makes everyone worried.
 
 They begin to check on the staff and Pinki asks   to stand with them as well. She suspects her for stealing the necklace. Dadi is upset over this. Rumi calls Shivaay to ask him to stop the check as she has put the necklace in Anika's purse.
 
  
  
 Shivaay is able to save Anika just in time by distracting Pinki and throwing the necklace on the floor. When they all find the necklace on the ground, Shivaay tells them that it must have fallen while Tia was busy dancing. Pinki decides to keep it safe, but yet again Shivaay is able to trick them and this time successfully. 
  
 After gaining hold of it, Rumi calls Shivaay on the first floor to give him the video. While he is on his way, Mrs Kapoor threatens him not to ruin anything this time as she has the video. Later, she discovers that she does not have the chip where she had kept it.
