 It is possible that the alignment of some roads proposed in the draft plan may be changed in view of the objections. In that case, these roads will have to razed and relaid elsewhere. NMC is likely to suffer loss of a few lakhs. When this was brought to the notice of Jadhav and Joshi, both had no explanation.
 
 Meanwhile, the standing committee is yet to receive Bawankuleâ€™s order of a third party audit of development works in the two areas. The directive was issued on April 25. Jadhav said that the order would be discussed in the next standing committee meeting.
 
 The minister had ordered an enquiry into road and water pipeline works done by NMC in Hudkeshwar-Narsala areas by private agency  . He had received complaints regarding substandard quality of works from large number of citizens.
 
 NMC is carrying out three projects in the two areas. The first is road works in Narsala worth Rs17.47 crore. The second is road works in Hudkeshwar worth Rs14.79 crore and water distribution network in both areas worth Rs63.05 crore.
 
 Bawankule had directed NMC that unless Geotech certified that quality of the three works was satisfactory bills of the contractors should not be cleared. The contractors should also continue the works under the supervision of Geotech.
