Naseeruddin Shah-Arshad Warsi-starrer   is perhaps India’s first film that explores the threat of eco-terrorism. The eco-thriller, directed by debutante  , talks about grave environmental issues that lie buried beneath money power and political clout. Produced by   and Prince Soni, the movie also stars Sagarika Ghatge,   and Sharad Kelkar. 

 Aparnaa, who has also written the film, is all praises for her actors. She says, “The best thing about this film is that I got to be around Naseerji and Arshad. They bond very well, and it’s fun to witness their camaraderie. Divya and I are very emotional, so we connected instantly. She plays a politician and was excited to portray a character who is totally unlike her. Sharad and Sagarika are such amazing actors and people that I had the best time working with them.” About backing an unusual project, Prince says, “Indian audiences have evolved and they have started leaning towards content-oriented films. I really liked the script of 'Irada' and the message it conveys.” 
 
 'Irada', an Irada Entertainment LLP production, releases on February 17.
