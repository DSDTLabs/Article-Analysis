Vadodara: A major tragedy was averted after a constable of State Reserve Police (SRP), group-5, accidentally fired one round from his AK-47 rifle while checking it at Koliyari near Godhra on Sunday. The incident took place when one of the platoons of group-5 was preparing to leave for Sabarmati Central Jail in Ahmedabad.

 Constable Ashwin Dhodiya registered a non-cognizable offence at Godhra B division police station after the incident. Police officials said Dhodiya was given his rifle from the weapons coach along with other personnel. After a few minutes when the platoon commander ordered them to check their rifles, others removed the magazine from their rifles and checked by pulling the triggers, but Dhodiya forgot to remove the magazine and fired.
