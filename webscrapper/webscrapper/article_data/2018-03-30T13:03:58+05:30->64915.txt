LUDHIANA: Battling financial constraints, the city’s lone para-badmiton player, Gagandeep Singh, (23), managed to qualify for the   Championhsop, 2018. He bagged the bronze medal in the recently concluded second National   at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.

 Singh clinched the bronze medal in the doubles event with his partner   in the match against the Maharastra team, which they defeated 21-8, 21-12 to grab the berth for Dubai International Para-Badminton Championship matches to be held from April 10 to April 15. Gagandeep hit the headlines when he won the bronze medal in the World Dwarf Games at   city of Canada from August 4 to August 12, 2017.
 
 Elaborating on his performance, Gagandeep Singh said, "Due to some health issues, I could not secure gold medal in the singles and double event of the National-level meet. But I won the bronze medal and made it to the Dubai International Para-Badminton championship".
 
 However, the shadow of financial difficulties looms large over his success. "I am the only para shuttler from   to qualify for the forthcoming international tournament but still, no one is offering sponsorship or financial help for travelling expenses. Since I have been touring different states continously, I am under a debt of Rs 2 lakh as I belong to weaker section of society and cannot manage travel expenses on a regular basis. I have approached the state sports department many times for financial help but all that they have is verbal assurance,” he said. 
 
 According to him, the state government has not offered financial assistance to international or national-level para players so that they can continue their sports activities. His coach Sandeep Sehgal said, “Gagandeep has the potential to do the country proud at international-level tournaments. The district badminton association is doing its best for him.”
