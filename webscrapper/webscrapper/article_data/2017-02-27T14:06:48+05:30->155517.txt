KOLKATA:   will look to seal their spot in the group stage of this year's   when they face the challenge of   of Maldives in the second leg of the AFC Cup   playoff match at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium here on Tuesday. 

 The first leg of the tie had ended 1-1 last week at the National Stadium in Male when Club Valencia striker Godfrey West levelled matters from the penalty spot in the second session after Darryl Duffy had put the green and maroons ahead in the sixth minute of the match. 
 
 Thus, Mohun Bagan will go into Tuesday's game with the advantage of an away goal which means they will go through to the group stages if the match ends goalless. 
 
 However,  's men will hope to seal their progress with a convincing victory. 
 
 Keeping an eye on the fixture crunch, the Mohun Bagan team management had decided to rest six of their key players for the first-leg game. They are all expected to be back in Tuesday's match-day squad which will surely bolster the team significantly. 
 
 Mohun Bagan's Haitian play-maker Sony Norde, who was suffering from knee pain, was among the six players rested last week. By his own admission, Sony Norde is feeling much better now and is most likely to play a part in the game. And, it goes without saying that the Haitian has the ability to make a significant impact on any game. 
 
 At the same time, the Kolkata side will look up to strikers Darryl Duffy, Jeje Lalpekhlua and Balwant Singh to put the rival team's defence under pressure and find the back of the net.
