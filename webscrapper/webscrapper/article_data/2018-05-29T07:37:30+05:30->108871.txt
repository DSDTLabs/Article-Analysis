LUCKNOW: Access to better   can set a number of rural girls free, according to a survey shared on the occasion of world menstrual hygiene day on Monday. 

 
 Though derived from a small sample, findings of the survey conducted by   and social organisation   show that awareness on menstrual issues, access to sanitary pads and provision of toilets in schools and homes can check the problem of missing school because of periods. 
 
  The survey engaged 60 girls from two schools in rural Lucknow for three months and scored them against 'movement of girls during periods' in two groups. 
 
  In the 'intervention' or experiment group, girls were properly oriented about menstruation. They were apprised on aspects like how to deal with the process, hygiene practices to be followed during periods, disposing a used napkins and so on. 
 
 The other or 'control' group was not given any such orientation. 
 
  The outcomes showed that girls in the intervention group took periods without any pressure. As a result, over 87% attended school like usual unlike the non-intervention group where one in two girls (53%) girls missed school during periods. The preparation also added to the confidence of the girls in the intervention group. 
 
 The survey showed that over 73% girls in the intervention group moved around freely for tasks like fetching vegetables, going to the bank or for shopping or attending social functions during periods. However, 60% girls in the control category refrained from going out during their periods. 
 
 Vatsalya chief functionary Dr Neelam Singh said the confidence displayed by these girls will go a long way in their life.
 
  Regularly attending school increases chances of their employment and brings down incidents of underage marriages, she added. According to data from the state health department, around 19 lakh teenage girls in UP every year quit school due to stigma around menstruation.
