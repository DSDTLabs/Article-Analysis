NAGPUR: Nagpur University (NU) has decided to hold optional re-exam of Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) final year students, who were distributed wrong question papers on the very first day of their summer exam on March 20.

 NU has left the choice up to the students to appear for the exam scheduled for April 4. The students need to submit an undertaking about their decision by March 31.
 
 Both, the students willing to re-appear as well as those who don’t wish to take the April 4 exam, need to submit the undertaking through their college to the exam centres concerned. The answer books for those opting out will be considered for evaluation.
 
 NU had said that of the 1,762 BBA students, 1,500 had appeared on March 20. Of this, just 25-30 were old course students.
 
 On March 20, the exam centres received just one set of question paper for ‘Entrepreurship Development’. This was as per the old course while the students belonged to the new one.
 
 The moderation committee committed the mistake of putting the question paper in the wrong envelope which was later picked up by the confidential section to dispatch to centre via email.
 
 The mess led to chaos at several centres hosting BBA students. The exam’s scheduled timing was 9.30am to 12.30pm but it continued till 2.30pm, following the goof-up. The extra time consumed affected the second shift of the exam, which was slotted for 2.30pm at 5.30pm , at many centres.
 
 Also, several students complained that since the first three questions of the paper ‘Entrepreurship Development’ were the same, it took a while for them to realize it were old course questions. Many students were also denied fresh answer books since they had consumed the one given to them.
 
 Though centre officials were quick to point out the mistake after students complaint, it took over one-and-a-half hour for NU’s exam section to send the correct file over e-mail to the centres.
