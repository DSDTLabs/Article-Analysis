NAGPUR: Born on the streets with nowhere to go, many puppies found a home at an   held at  . The camp was organized by   in association with   (PFA), The Loyals and Inner Wheel Club of Nagpur to provide shelter to more than 50 puppies brought to the camp by NMC and citizens. 

 Karishma Galani, secretary of PFA, said, “We wanted to provide home to puppies as there is no one to look after them. They are ‘desi’ puppies and do not need much care like other breeds. Not much money is required to be spent on them. Besides, they groom well in Indian conditions,” she said.
 
 Many dog lovers visited the camp in search of a new pet. Before the adoption, citizens were counselled by dog trainers. Roohi Kulkarni, a certified trainer, said, “I tried to find out the background of the family interested in adoption. This helps them adopt a puppy that suits them well. We tell them about the care and diet of puppies and suggest them vaccines,” Roohi said. 
 
 “We keep track of puppies adopted by families, pay regular home visits to see if it has adjusted well,” Roohi added. Registration forms were also filled by the organizers from the families adopting puppy. 
 
 “We found three puppies in our neighbourhood and brought them here in the hope that they will find some owner,” said Abhishek Bhatnagar, a resident of Narendra Nagar. 
 
 Citizens who adopted puppies at the camp did their bit in giving them a home. Sushan Manthanwar, a lawyer, said, “I always loved dogs but lost mine. So I wanted to adopt a new one. As these puppies are ‘desi’, they will adjust well in our home.” 
 
 Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar, Dr Shirish Upadhyay and Gajendra Mahele, veterinary officer at NMC, were the chief guests at the camp. Rahul Khalad, Shefali Shah, Jyoti Chhabriya, Mira Khullar and Nisha Dua worked for the success of the camp.
