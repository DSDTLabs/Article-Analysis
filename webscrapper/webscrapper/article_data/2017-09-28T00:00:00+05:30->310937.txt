We had told you earlier that   will be playing an ethical hacker in his next,  . Now, we’ve learnt that the film, directed by  , deals with a psychology-based concept that is eerily similar to the suicide game,  .

 In the last few months, if there’s any online trend that’s got parents and teachers worried, it’s the killer Blue Whale Challenge. The game is said to be monitored by a group of curators, who give participants — a majority of them school students and young adults — a set of tasks that has to be completed in 50 days. The last one requires the player to commit suicide. According to a recent report, India had the highest number of online searches related to the Blue Whale Challenge across the globe. 
 
 Kalees says, “I’d written the script almost five years ago. So, I was shocked when people who’ve worked on the film pointed out the similarity between its premise and this challenge. The film deals with the idea that people can make you do anything they want, through a computer. You can be brainwashed and sucked into a virtual world — if they point to a plastic soap dish and say it’s golden, you will believe that it’s golden. It’s like you are living in a world of inception and those psychopaths have the power to control your life or even take it away. When I narrated the concept, most of them couldn’t believe that something like this could happen. But for the last few months, after the Blue Whale Challenge became an online threat, they have started believing that you can be emotionally and mentally controlled through a software. I hope that this film exposes the mentality of such people and warns others to stay safe and away from such people when they are online.”
