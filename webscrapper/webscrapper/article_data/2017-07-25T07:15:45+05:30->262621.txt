CHENNAI: A structure built to serve as   for residents of slum tenements   is being used as a police station for the past six years.

 Together, the   (TNSCB) tenements in the two residential colonies off OMR house more than 23,000 families including those in the Tsunami resettlements. These families have been deprived of the sole community hall since 2011 when the J11 Kannagi Nagar police station was inaugurated on the premises.
 
 The bright red and cream building, a few senior officers point out, is not a permanent place for the jurisidictional police and could become vacant after they get a permanent structure. But, that has not happened for the past six years and the residents of the two colonies, which house more than 1,20,000 people, are forced to depend on expensive private facilities to hold wedding functions, birthday parties, etc.
 
 “We have submitted papers and requested land for a new building. Ten grounds (1 ground = 2,400 sq ft) of land have been identified and the process of getting approval from higher-ups is on,” said a police officer.
 
 The ground floor of a building in the area, located near the resettlement colony for the tsunami affected and now being used as the TNSCB office, was briefly utilised to celebrate birthday parties, but that is no longer the case.
 
 “Now there is no place for us to hold community gatherings,” said K Saravanan, a resident of Ezhil Nagar.
 
 Another resident who did not want to be identified, said that the older and bigger hall was where the Kannagi Nagar police station is now house. “The small hall in the slum board office building is no longer used by the residents, but only for meetings by officials these days,” he said.
 
 An employee of the slum clearance board office confirmed that the hall was briefly being used for celebrating birthdays. “The office used to be in Ezhil Nagar earlier, after which it was shifted to this building,” he added.
