NOIDA: Reminding UP chief minister   of unkept promises, industry representatives of   on Wednesday sent a letter of grievance to him on Wednesday, the day when the Election Commission announced polling dates for Uttar Pradesh and four other states.

 Industry insiders claimed major   announcements, made by Akhilesh after he came to power in 2012, had not materialised to date.
 
 The list of unkept promises includes a waiver on registration charges for electronics and food-based industries . A cut in lease rent for industrial land and conversion of plots vacated by ITeS companies were among other long-pending demands of industrial associations of Gautam Budh Nagar that will vote on February 11.
 
 “One of the first promises Akhilesh Yadav had made after taking over as chief minister was to give a fillip to food-based industries in Gautam Budh Nagar. He had also said that waivers would be announced for electronic companies setting up base here. But to date, none of these promises materialised,”   Entrepreneurs’ Association president Vipin Malhan told TOI.
 
 Malhan said they had been demanding conversion of those plots, which were earlier held by ITeS companies but later vacated for various reasons. But that never happened.
 
 “Many ITeS companies left the area after the slowdown in 2008. So, those allotments should have been converted to make better use of the vacant plots. We had persuaded the Noida Authority to convert them and it had agreed, but things got stuck at the state government-level,” Malhan alleged. The letter reiterated the need for relief to industrial units through reduction in lease rent.
