NAGPUR: The   (DRT) has rejected the application of Piyush Marodia, managing director of Gupta Coal, seeking permission to travel to Singapore. The company has taken a loan of Rs58.89 crore from   (SBI) and is unable to repay it. DRT has impounded the passport of all the directors of Gupta Coal.

 DRT presiding officer   stated in his order that there was no compelling reason for Marodia to go abroad. Moreover, if he was allowed to leave India, it may become difficult to bring him back to the country in view of the heavy dues recoverable from him.
 
 SBI had fielded advocates SN Kumar, Ashwini Sakhare and Vinit Meshram in the DRT. The lawyers strongly opposed Marodia’s application. They pointed out that despite orders of the Tribunal, Marodia had not disclosed his movable and immovable assets on affidavit and thus committed contempt of the Tribunal. So far, Gupta Coal had not repaid a single paisa of the loan. As an official liquidator had been appointed over Gupta Coal, he could go to Singapore in place of Marodia if it was really required. The DRT upheld this contention and expressed displeasure over Marodia’s failure to disclose his assets.
 
 Marodia had been caught by the police carrying cash Rs1.68 crore near Vidhan Bhavan in Mumbai in 2011 during the monsoon session of the state legislature. The opposition leaders from BJP and   had alleged that he had come to bribe top bureaucrats and ministers.
