 The 34th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, which is currently in progress, resolved to give Sri Lanka two more years to probe war crimes committed during the conflict between state forces and the   (LTTE) rebels. In the eight years that have passed since the war ended, the government has failed to prosecute alleged war crimes such as torture, unlawful killings and enforced disappearances. VCK founder Thol Thiru mavalavan said, “There are efforts to involve him in the ethnic issue. Superstar (Raji nikanth) should not get involved in this matter and I say this as a friend. “ Rajinikanth is scheduled to hand over 150 homes built by   for displaced Tamils in northern Jaffna.
 
 Incidentally, Lyca Productions had in 2014 faced opposition in Tamil Nadu when various pro-Tamil parties and organisations including VCK and TVK had opposed its production of the movie 'Kaththi', starring actor Vijay. There were allegations that the proprietor of Lyca Productions, Allirajah Subaskaran, had close business ties with then Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse Thirumavalvan said he had no problem with the commercial motive of Rajinikanth's visit to Sri Lanka but said he felt there could be a “political motive“ behind it.
 
 TVK founder and former MLA T Velmurugan said the actor should not “fall prey“ to the efforts to paint a rosy picture of Sinhala-Tamil relations in the island nation.
