 and his daughter   were in the capital for the play The Last Salute, which was staged in   College. After the play, the father-daughter duo, along with  , the lead actor of the play, stepped out to take in the campus-wali feel and also boarded an e-rickshaw at the Vishwavidyalaya Metro Station.

 Pooja said, “I take rickshaws in Mumbai quite often, but this is the first time that I am sitting on an e-rick in Delhi.” Mahesh added, “I think it was the first time when I sat on a battery rickshaw. Main rickshaw pe toh baitha hoon, but battery wale pe nahi.”
 
 Talking about his overall experience and the young talent from DU that is making its away into the industry, Bhatt added, “Coming to DU and performing the play in front of a jam-packed auditorium where students were also sitting on the floor and encouraging the performance, that was really overwhelming. I think, students must not accept the things as they are, and should be able to hear those who are voiceless. Shah Rukh graduated from Hans Raj and I think he is one of the best actors we have. I think students should be given the basic training at universities and colleges so that they can work hard to make their way into the industry. Surviving in the industry is another thing, but they can be given the training at the colleges level.”
