Mapusa: The Goa Pradesh Congress Committee has threatened to approach the high court over the government’s attempt to include Mapusa town under the proposed downtown planning scheme and also over the inclusion of several villages under the PDA.  Congress has alleged that a number of cultivable fields will be converted into settlements under these schemes and poor farmers will never be compensated.  Congress Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco addressed reporters at the North Goa district office in Mapusa on Thursday highlighting the party’s stand on the issue of PDAs and the downtown planning scheme for Mapusa. Tivim MLA Nilkant Harlankar displayed the outline development plan for Mapusa and indicated places where the government intends to undertake the downtown scheme. Lourenco said the government is trying to destroy Goan identity with faulty planning.
