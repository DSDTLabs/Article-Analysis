Bicholim: Speaker of Goa legislative assembly and Sakhali MLA Pramod Sawant suffered a set back as the panel backed by him failed to win the polls to the Sakhali municipal council (SMC). ‘Together for Sakhali’ panel led by former chairperson Dharmesh Saglani of the Congress retained power to the 13-member civic body with eight of its candidates emerging victorious. Two independent candidates, Yeshwant Madkar and Shubhada Sawaikar, have extended their support to Saglani’s panel, taking its tally to 10. The BJP-backed panel led by Sawant had to be content with only three seats. Sawant, however, said that he would try to form an alliance and secure a majority to rule the council. The results were declared on Monday. Soon after the results, Saglani was congratulated by Congress veteran Pratapsingh Rane. SMC is part of Sakhali assembly constituency, which Sawant is representing for the second consecutive term. Saglani was the Congress candidate in Sakhali constituency in the 2017 assembly election. Sources say that Saglani has a close relationship with the Ranes. Sawant had won the 2017 assembly polls, though Saglani was supported by current health minister Vishwajit Rane who was then in Congress.  Vishwajit and Sawant were political rivals at least till March 2017, when the Valpoi MLA switched sides to the BJP. Saglani credited the victory to the voters. Sawant said that the BJP campaign was lacking in some areas.
