NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from a popular crime show on television, a 16-year-old boy kidnapped his employer’s 4-year-old   and demanded a ransom of Rs 3 lakh from the family. The police have rescued the child and apprehended the accused from Bareilly, UP, within 12 hours of receiving the complaint.

 The accused has been sent to a reformation centre after being produced before the   Justice Board (JJB).
 
 According to DCP (east) Omvir Singh, parents of the child lodged a complaint after the child went missing on Monday afternoon. “An FIR was lodged and a special team led by inspector Narender singh and sub-inspector   was formed to rescue the child,” Singh said.
 
 After questioning locals , the team zeroed in on a juvenile who used to work for the family till last year and had again come back recently seeking work. The accused had left the job after the demise of his mother and moved to Badaun, his native village. 
 
 The juvenile had been missing, along with the child, since Monday afternoon. At 9.34pm, a message was received on the mobile phone of the boy’s father seeking a ransom of Rs 3 lakh. The messenger also threatened to kill the boy. The ransom had to be delivered in Bareilly by sunrise.
 
 “Another message came at 9.57pm, saying he should not be disturbed”, otherwise he will abandon the kid. Another message was received at 12.06am that the kid had been served dinner and will not be harmed if the money is delivered on time,” the DCP said. Following these messages, police raided several places. Around 4am, they finally traced the juvenile and the child near a mall in Bareilly.
