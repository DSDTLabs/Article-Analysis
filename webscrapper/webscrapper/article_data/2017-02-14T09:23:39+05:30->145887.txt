 Haphazard parking of vehicles in front of the outpatient (OP) block is the main reason for traffic chaos, said witnesses. The hospital management and security do not seem to bother about the problems faced by   and their attendants everyday as cars honking outside the hospital and drivers looking for parking is a familiar sight. 
 
 Even ambulances find it difficult to come near the entrance. Every day between 8 am and 2 pm, visitors as well as attendants have to scramble for parking space within a limited area near the out-patient block earmarked for vehicles. 
 
 Many vehicles, including two-wheelers, autos and four-wheelers occupy the OP block space. Most of the times, vehicles are found parked without any order leading to traffic congestion in the vicinity.
 
 "I came along with my mother here but had to wait for a long time at the entrance due to the parking problem. Not just me, other patients also suffer as a result of this,'' Naresh, an attendant told TOI. 
 
 As a result, a lone vacant spot near OGH out-patient block, always finds two to three ambulance waiting to take bodies or serious patients to other places.
