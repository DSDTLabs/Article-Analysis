 In a letter to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Monday, Kejriwal said they would reach Raj Niwas by 9.30am to find a solution to the sealing issue.

 As the sealing matter comes under the LG, he would bring everybody to Baijal, wrote Kejriwal. “As they (BJP members) will reach my residence at 9am, I hope that we all will come to your residence at 9.30am,” the CM said, adding that he hoped that Baijal would find a solution without any delay. He also wrote that he was sending a copy of the letter to the BJP members. 
 
 AAP and BJP have blamed each for traders’ plight due to the sealing drive being carried out by the civic bodies on the directive of the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee. 
 
 While AAP has demanded that the Centre either brings an ordinance or amends Delhi Master Plan 2021, BJP has said the AAP government should notify mixed land use.
