PATNA: At least five new buses were launched on the   (PU) route on Wednesday morning. The buses, which will run at an interval of every 15 minutes, were flagged off by state transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal from PU’s Senate House.

 Speaking on the occasion, Agarwal said, “Each bus, with a capacity of 45 passengers, is meant for college and school students as well as the general public. If the demand increases, we will roll out more buses on the route and provide bus passes to students from the new academic session in July.”
 
 The move is expected to benefit a large number of students as there are several colleges and schools located on the stretch from Gandhi Maidan to NIT-Patna, including Patna Science College, B N College, Patna College, Patna Medical College and Hospital and Patna Dental College, among others. The buses will ply from 7am to 10pm and charge Rs 5 each from the boarders.
 
 Meanwhile, students hailed the new bus services launched for them. Patna College student   said, “Most mini buses that used to ply on this route were overcrowded. I usually took an autorickshaw from Gandhi Maidan which charged Rs 8 for dropping me at the college gate.”
 
 The   reminded NIT-P’s Divya Choudhary of her old school days. She said, “Going to and coming back from college with friends in a bus sounds fun.”

The CM immediately accepted their request and asked the transport department to consider the demand.
 
 PUSU president Divyanshu told this newspaper on Wednesday that the students’ union had written a letter to the transport department in April, urging them to start bus services for  .
