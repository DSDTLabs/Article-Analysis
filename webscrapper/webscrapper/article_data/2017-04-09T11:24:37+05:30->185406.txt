NASHIK: The truckers from Nashik will not be going on proposed strike from April 9 after the parent body of the organisation,   ( ), called off the stir. 

 “We attended a meeting in Pune on Saturday. There, we received the message that the AIMTC has called off the strike after successful negotiations with the   ( ),” Anju Singhal, president of Nashik Transporters’ Association said.
 
 “Our major demand was lowering of Third Party Premium (TPP), which most truckers prefer. This TPP is decided arbitrarily by the IRDA. There has been a high rise in the TPP. The truckers wanted a rationale rise in the same,” Singhal said. 
 
 The truckers also pointed out that they wanted seamless connectivity across the country without having to stop anywhere. The truckers had demanded alternate service roads, implementation of Yellow Line Concept, national permits for buses and tourist vehicles, etc.
 
 The strike was earlier scheduled from April 20 in Maharashtra but later on preponed to April 9. “While the entire movement of trucks to and from South India had already been shut down, Maharashtra was to join the strike from April 9. However, the same has been called off,” Singhal added. 
 
 This means that over 1,500 truckers will now continue with their jobs and consignments of delivering goods. 
 
 “The truckers had already cancelled bookings, or even stopped taking bookings for the period. But all these have now resumed. The things will be normal,” Singhal said.
