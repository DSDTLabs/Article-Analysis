PUNE: Stressing on segregation of trash at source and launch of paper/plastic waste processing units, guardian minister   on Saturday said he was “very closely” following the city’s   issue.

 “The prime challenge here is of segregation of waste. The city needs to improve on it. I feel the city requires more segregation points, which will help in processing trash. Also, there is a plan to process garbage within localities. There is a proposal to speak with the agriculture department to provide it with compost fertilizers generated from the city’s wet garbage. We shall come out with a comprehensive plan,” Bapat said, adding that he talked to several experts on the issue.
 
 The opposition parties, including  , had flayed Bapat for his absence in the city during the garbage stalemate after villagers stalled dumping of the city’s garbage at the Uruli site.
 
 Bapat said, “Before I went on a tour I spoke to   (minister of state for water resources) about the garbage issue and it was decided that he would initiate necessary steps for a solution. We all are very serious about the garbage issue. The problem is not only confined to the city. Peripheral villages are also facing the garbage challenge. People in Uruli are opposed to the dumping of city’s garbage there. We are working on an effective plan for a long-term solution and have resolved to eliminate the city’s garbage issue in an effective way.”
 
 Bapat also said he had plans to inspect the processing units started in the city’s peripheral areas and discuss the possibility of enhancing the processing capacity of every unit.
