NOIDA: District magistrate N P   asked   on Wednesday to explain why a postmortem was not conducted on the girl who had allegedly committed suicide in   village.

 Singh said that he had come to know about the incident through media reports.
 
 “We have asked the police officers concerned to explain why the postmortem was not conducted when the victim had allegedly committed suicide,” he said.
 
 The 19-year-old girl had committed suicide on Monday after she was allegedly molested by two youths in the village. Locals requesting anonymity told TOI that the youths had molested her while she was going to the market.
 
 “The girl returned home and informed her family members. However, the elders of the family held a meeting and hushed up the matter. The victim was not happy with the family’s approach and she committed suicide,” a resident said. Her family members cremated the body on the same day without informing the police.
 
 The police had not taken any action, saying that they did not receive any complaint from the family.
