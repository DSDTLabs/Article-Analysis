CHENNAI: The 60-day fishing ban along the east coast in the state comes into effect from midnight on Saturday. Introduced in the state since 2003, the annual ban will end on June 14 and is aimed at replenishing marine fish resources which in turn will increase the catch in the postban period.

 When the ban was introduced in the city, the fish catch was about four lakh tonnes, said state fisheries officials, adding that in the past 15 years, the catch has increased by a tonne.   president  , however, said the oil spill in Ennore in January last year had impacted the catch in Tiruvallur, Chennai and Kancheepuram districts.
 
 
 The oil spill polluted the creeks and shoreline due to which the spawn was unable to hatch, reducing the catch in subsequent fishing seasons, said Bharathi. Nearly 1,200 mechanised boats in   fishing harbour will be covered by the ban, he said.
 
  fish market member AGS Anbu said Kochi and   would supply most of the fish to the city during the ban, while small quantities of fish would also come from Andaman, Bihar and  . About 30 tonnes of fish would land in the city in the next two months, he added.
 
 The ban will affect all mechanised boats in Tuticorin district and a section of the coastal hamlets in Kanyakumari district that lie on the east coast.
 
 It will not affect fishermen of Tirunelveli district as there are no mechanised boats in the nine coastal villages.
 
 “Only around 270 mechanised boats operating from Chinna Muttom harbour are covered under the ban as they are on the east coast,” said an official from Kanyakumari district.
