DHARAMSHALA: The   government on Saturday decided to amend the Town and Country Planning Rules 2018 to allow sealing of unauthorized buildings or portions.

 “The building would be sealed after giving defaulters an opportunity of being heard under the amendment in the Act. This will give relief to the hoteliers and their objections will be invited under the rule,” said a statement issued by the government.
 
 The decision was taken during a cabinet meeting, presided over by the chief minister.
 
 About 150 hotels, which had built illegal portions, had been closed after the high court ordered snapping of electricity and water connections a month back.
 
 Earlier, the TCP department did not have powers to seal portions of buildings. Now, the department will seal the illegal portions of these hotels and legal portions will be allowed to function.
 
 During the cabinet meeting, an approval was accorded to grant interim relief to regular government employees, pensioners, family pensioners at the rate of 8% basic pay to be payable from January 1, 2016.
 
 The cabinet also decided to increase maternity leave of women   on a   from 135 days to 180 days.
