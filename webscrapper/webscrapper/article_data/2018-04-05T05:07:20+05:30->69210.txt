HUBBALLI: BJP national president  's meeting with the heads of four branches of Kanaka Guru Peetha at Kaginele in  's Haveri district and AICC chief  's interaction with the mutt's senior pontiff Niranjanananda Puri Swami at Belludi on Tuesday have triggered a debate.

 Kaginele is thespiritual centre for the Kuruba community to which Karnataka CM   belongs.
 
 Before attending the state-level OBC meet at Kaginele on Tuesday, Shah visited the mutt and met the four seers. At the same time, Rahul met the senior pontiff at Belludi. This gave rise to speculation that it was deliberate because the pontiff was upset with the BJP leadership for the 'ill-treatment' meted out to CH Vijayashankar, a former MP. Vijayashankar is an influential Kuruba leader from Mysuru who was in BJP but had joined Congress recently. Justifying his meeting with Rahul, Niranjanananda said he got a call from CM Siddaramaiah, informing him about the interaction with the AICC chief. This was followed by BJP seeking an appointment.
 
 "I'm still upset with the BJP leadership for ill-treating Vijayashankar when he was in that party... But my absence at the mutt during Shah's visit had nothing to do with my disappointment with the BJP," he said.
 
 "Though the preparation for the OBC meet had been going on for a month, nobody from BJP contacted me. When they did, I told them that I'd already promised to meet Rahul. How could I meet both leaders the same day? I sent the branch heads to meet Shah. he said. The mutt branch heads urged Amit Shah to give tickets to Kurubas wherever possible and he promised to do it, the pontiff said.
