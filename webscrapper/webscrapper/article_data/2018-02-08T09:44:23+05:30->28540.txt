LUCKNOW: Even though   suffered a humiliating defeat in 2017 UP assembly elections, Mayawati’s party had no shortage of funds ahead of the polls, as the party’s income, essentially through donations, grew by over 266% in financial year 2016-17 over the previous year, says   (ADR) in its report.

 ADR compiled the report after analysing the details provided by the national parties in their audit reports to  .
 
 The report reveals that BSP’s income rose from just over Rs 47 crore in 2015-16 to more than Rs 126 crore in 2016-17. The Dalit outfit declared a total income of Rs 173.58 crore during 2016-17 financial year.
 
 BSP showed that its income rose, despite demonetisation, as it geared up to contest the 2017 UP assembly elections. The party, however, spent only 30% of the income before assembly elections, report said.
 
 In all, only five parties — BSP, All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), CPM and CPI — submitted their annual income totalling around Rs 300 crore, with the ECI. Not surprisingly, BSP alone accounted for almost 58% of the total annual income of five parties taken together.
 
 BJP and Congress have yet to submit their annual income details to the ECI, the ADR report said.
