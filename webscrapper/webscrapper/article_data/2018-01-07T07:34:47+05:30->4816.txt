HYDERABAD: The TRS government is all set to deliver its   after the presentation of the state budget. After a series of meetings with bankers and land revenue officials, the finance department has zeroed down on the total burden on the state due to the capital incentive scheme for farmers as Rs 6,000 crore for one crop. Chief minister   directed them to get ready to disburse the amount after the budget, probably in May. 

 As per the scheme, every farmer will get Rs 4,000 per acre per crop to be disbursed twice a year. 
 
 The CM has promised Rs 8,000 per acre in a year as capital incentive to more than 40 lakh farmers.
 
 The CM wants to credit at least one instalment of the amount into the farmers' accounts ahead of the general elections in order to get a positive response from the farming community.
 
 After the completion of the land records purification programme, the revenue department has submitted a detailed report to the CM and the finance department. KCR will decide the guidelines for the implementation of the scheme in consultation with the finance officials.
 
 The state government has already decided not to extend the   to tenant farmers though there was huge pressure from different political parties to do so. 
 
 "Extending it to tenant farmers would lead to disputes and possible collapse of the scheme," said a senior official in the revenue department.
 
 The TRS government has decided to present a separate budget with the provision for the capital incentive scheme. A committee comprising ministers Pocharam Srinivasa Reddy, Etela Rajender,  , T Nageswara Rao, G Jagadish Reddy and P   will oversee the implementation of the programme. The farmer coordination panel will monitor the implementation.
