Admit it, 2016 was a tough year – globally and nationally.  , unexpected celebrity deaths and a bleak political scenario has left us looking for some method to everyday madness. Help is at hand with ‘hygge’ (pronounced hue-gah) – a centuries-old lifestyle concept exported from the Nordic countries that will wrap you in a warm bear hug.   is a Danish word meaning a feeling or mood that lets you take genuine pleasure in making ordinary, everyday moments more meaningful, beautiful or special.
 
  
 
  
  Some refer to hygge as an “art of creating intimacy” (either with yourself, friends or your home). And the cold season works beautifully with this cosy concept. Welcome hygge into your home with candles, warm blankets and coffee cups. Interior designer Neetu Arora says, “Hygge styles of décor have almost become an art form that create a sense of intimacy in any given environment.”
  
  It’s all about getting your hands on anything that brings warmth — from the gentle flicker of candlelight, to some soul-searching books, or eating candlelight dinner with family. Interior designer Chandni Nath Israni says, “Even your bathroom space can be a hygge corner, with scented candles, white walls and warm rugs.”
  
  On Instagram, there are almost 1.5 million #hygge posts of falling leaves, bowls of pumpkin soup and people wrapped in blankets. On Pinterest, there’s a rise of 285% in hygge-themed pinning. For more pointers, look up some books (for example Hygge: The Danish Art of Happiness; The Little Book of Hygge: The Danish Way to Live Well; Hygge: A Celebration of Simple Pleasures) published on the topic.
  
  
 
  
  Candles are an integral part of hygge décor. The warm glow it brings on cold days is what the concept of cosiness is all about. Try and make your home gadget-free. Arora says, “Use soft textures to create relaxing moments for the mind, for instance, faux fur throws, fluffy woollen rugs and thick chunky knit cushions are the right picks.” She also suggests creating a cosy corner by putting your favourite photographs on one side. “It’s about being intimate and warm, having relationships that are cosy,” she adds.
  
  When it comes to a hygge home, less is more. Tanya Mehra, designer of outdoor spaces says, “Introduce lot of warm wood into your patio and living room. Even wooden flooring gives a warm, hygge feel. Try to get in lots of plants and greenery into every corner of your home.”
  
  
  
 
  Hygge (pronounced hue-gah) is a Danish word meaning a feeling or mood that comes from taking genuine pleasure in making ordinary, everyday moments more meaningful, beautiful or special. Whether it’s making coffee or a cosy evening in with friends to lighting a candle – hygge is being aware of a good moment – simple or special. It has been listed as a “word of the year” by both the Collins and Oxford dictionaries.
