BENGALURU: Both the   and   on Monday sought to give a political spin to the attack on two policemen in Varthur by highlighting the connections of the accused with the other party. 

 The duo was allegedly beaten up by a group of gamblers on Sunday. Soon after the video of the cops being thrashed surfaced, the Congress released a photograph of one of the accused, Sandeep, posing with Mahadevapura MLA and party state general secretary Aravind Limbavali. Home minister   said the accused were BJP party workers.
 
 However, towards evening, the BJP hit back with pictures of some of the accused, Murali Mohan, Kumar and Murthy, featuring in the hoardings of Congress worker A C Srinivas, who is a ticket aspirant for the Mahadevapura constituency.
 
 “Reddy is trying to mislead the public ahead of the 2018 elections. The accused are followers of the Congress ticket aspirant for Mahadevapura. The assault on policemen is condemnable, and over the last few weeks, the Congress has been giving a free hand to goondas in the state. The attack proves the same,” said Limbavali said in a statement.
 
 Opposition leader in the legislative assembly, Jagadish Shettar, said law and order has collapsed in the state. Citing Sunday’s alleged attack on the two constables as another piece of evidence to back his allegation, Shettar told reporters in Hubballi on Monday that police and other government employees are scared while discharging their duties. 
 
 “A total of 5,401 government employees, including policemen, have been attacked from 2013-14 to 2017-18. Crimes against women and others show the collapse of law and order in the same period. A total of 37,410 cases of crime against women have been reported in the state. The cases of rape number 3,833, including 541 in Bengaluru. As many as 2,804 women have been murdered during the Congress regime,” he alleged.
