HOUSTON: The largest automaker in US,  , on Tuesday said it will lay off 1,100 workers at an assembly plant in Michigan, the fourth cut in its workforce since November last year.

 The Detroit-headquartered company is eliminating the third shift at its Lansing Delta Township plant which makes three SUVs built on the same platform - the  , the Buick Enclave and the GMC Acadia. 
 
 But the new version of the Acadia is being built on a smaller platform, so production of that car moved to a Spring Hill, Tennessee plant last summer.
 
 The company has been scaling back production and employment due to lower US sales.
 
 In November, General Motors said it was eliminating the third shift at the nearby Lansing Grand River plant, as well as at the Lordstown Ohio plant.
 
 Those layoffs, which were the first US job cuts announced by General Motors since 2010, took place in late January.
 
 Then in December, it announced plans to eliminate the third shift at its only remaining facility within Detroit city limits - the Detroit Hamtramck plant.
 
 The four rounds of layoffs will cut a total of 4,400 jobs.
 
 The company employed 105,000 people as of the end of last year. However, it still has more US employees now than it did in 2015, when it employed 97,000 workers.
