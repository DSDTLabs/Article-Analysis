DEOLALI/NASHIK: The process to elect the next   for the   Cantonment Board will be held this week as the tenure of Baburao Mojad, who is currently holding the post, ends on March 6. 

 The ruling   may give the opportunity to its alliance partner, RPI (A), this time. 
 
 “Electing the vice-president of the board is an official process and it will be held as per the rules. Members will elect one of them as a vice-president unanimously by the end of this week. But it’s not possible to name someone before the election process,” said city BJP president Balasaheb Sanap, who will be the final authority to decide the name of the next president. 
 
 In the eight-member board, the BJP has five members and the RPI (A) has one. The Shiv Sena, which is not in the alliance, has one representative, while one is independent. The BJP has been enjoying the position of the deputy chairperson in the board for the last two years. BJP’s Sachin Thakre was its vice-president for 2015-16.
 
 According to sources, the post may go to RPI’s Prabhavati Dhiware this time as the nation is observing the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. Senior members Bhagwan Kataria and Dinkar Athaw are also in the race. If Dhiware becomes the Vice-President, she will be the first woman vice-president of the Deolali Cantonment Board. 
 
 Deolali   is one of the three biggest cantonments in India with an annual budget of Rs 70 crore. Brigadier   is the statuary president of the board, while the vice-president is elected from the public.
