HYDERABAD: Finding fault with the Union government for according permission to prosecute IAS officer   without assigning any reasons for its decision, Justice B Siva Sankara Rao of the Hyderabad high   on Thursday quashed the case registered by the   in the Emaar-APIIC scam.

 The   scam pertains to 550 acres of land worth crores at  , which had fallen into the hands of private buyers, while the government got a pittance from the deal between   and Dubai-based Emaar company.
 
 The CBI held Subrahmanyam responsible partly because he was MD of APIIC between 2005 and 2006 when the price of the land was being determined. CBI saw a conspiracy in the IAS officer’s decision to fix Rs 29 lakh per acre and made him accused No 11 in the chargesheet.
 
 Delivering the judgement on a petition filed by the officer, the judge said Subrahmanyam merely followed and implemented the decisions taken by the state cabinet. Getting into the technical aspects, the judge said the state government in 2012 had examined the role of the bureaucrat and refused to accord permission to the authorities to prosecute him. Later, the Centre considered the same set of facts and accorded permission. “This amounts to review and hence, needs a reasoned order,” the judge said. But the Centre’s order carried no reasons as to why it had taken a view that was diametrically opposite, the judge said. Taking such a view without any reasons is impermissible under law, the judge said and quashed the case against Subrahmanyam.
