PATNA: “Samay aane par thasunga,” said RJD chief   on Saturday when asked about former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi’s allegation about the involvement of his family in an illegal  .

 Though Lalu did not elaborate what exactly he meant, “thasunga” is a Bhojpuri expression connoting brutal revenge.
 
 Lalu was coming out of a conference of cardiologists when newsmen asked about the Modi’s allegation that the Patna zoo, which comes under his son Tej Pratap Yadav’s forest ministry, purchased soil worth Rs 90 lakh from an upcoming mall without floating tenders. 
 
 Modi also alleged at a press conference earlier this week that the Rs 200 crore-worth land of the mall was given to Lalu by a hospitality group in lieu of the transfer of railways’ two hotels to it when Lalu was railway minister. “The mall is also owned by a firm which has Lalu’s wife   and sons Tej Pratap and deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav have shares,” he said.
 
 While politely refusing to go into the details of Modi’s allegations, Lalu said he would soon call mediapersons at his residence to reply to the allegation.
 
 Addressing the conference earlier, Lalu had the doctors splitting their sides. “Aankh theek rakhna hai toh aankh senkte rahna padta hai,” he said. Describing Union health minister J P Nadda as an ‘achchha ladka’ (nice boy), Lalu said Nadda studied in Patna University where his father was a professor. “I was a student leader in PU then,” he said.
