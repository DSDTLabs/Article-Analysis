LUCKNOW:   has completed the speed testing of Lucknow Metro. Lucknow   Rail Corporation now has to get a final   from the organisation before the Metro is cleared for commercial operation. 

 The testing process, which began in February, was expected to end on March 21, considering Holi holidays. However, Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) completed it on Thursday, two weeks ahead of schedule. 
 
 This might still not help the Metro meet its March 26 deadline for commercial operations. The RDSO team said that preparation of the draft test report and getting approvals from various directorates would take about 10 days. This might delay the final speed certificate from RDSO. The certificate is mandatory to get approval from the Commissioner of Metro Railway Safety. 
 
 RDSO has tested the speed of the train on two parameters-oscillation trials and emergency braking distance. It tested the train both in loaded and unloaded conditions and on various speed levels. "At the full speed of 90km per hour, the train stops after 200-250 metres when emergency brakes are applied. This is standard functioning," an official said.
 
 The team said after preparing the draft report of testing, it would be circulated across various directorates of RDSO for approval. Usually, the directorates are given a week for giving their feedback. Once they all respond, the RDSO team will incorporate their suggestions and prepare a final speed certificate.
