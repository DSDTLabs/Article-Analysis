BHOPAL: The day pictures of US marines slurping blood of venomous snakes during a jungle survival drill went viral, an angry farmer in a remote village of Chambal region in Madhya Pradesh chewed off a cobra’s head. Although, in a drunken stupor.

 When his family members found him unconscious with blood on his face a dead snake near him they took him to the district hospital, said sources.
 
 After examining him and the snake, doctors concluded that he was fortunate to have survived the conduct.
 
 Jalim Singh Kushwah, resident of Morena’s Pacher village was hospitalised in an unconscious state on Friday evening.
 
 “We are still surprised on what prompted him to chew a cobra’s head. He was not ready to utter a word. Kushwah’s family had brought the snake along,” Dr Ragvendra Yadav, who treated him at the district hospital, told TOI.
 
 “Kushwah moved out of the hospital without informing us,” Dr Yadav added. 
 
 “If the venom had entered his bloodstream, he would not have reached hospital” said the doctor.
 
 A similar case was reported from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh also where a man in Hardoi district had chewed off a snake’s head after being bitten by it.
