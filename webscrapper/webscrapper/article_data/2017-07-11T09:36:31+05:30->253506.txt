PUNE: Notwithstanding her nightmarish disqualification after winning the   run at the Asian   Championships,   is taking heart from the fact that she actually won the race and the gold eluded her on a technicality. The day after the forgettable moment, the 21-yearold Pune-based athlete sounded composed as she recalled Sunday night's dramatic turn of events in Bhubaneswar.

 “It felt good when I won the race, but not so good after that. It was very (emotional),” Archana said on Monday from Dharamsala, where she has been undergoing high-altitude training as part of the national camp under Belarussian   for the last couple of months. “During the run I didn't know what happened, who pushed whom. All I know is I won the race and the whole of India watched it. No one can deny that I am the best in the country and Asia. That's what I will remember,” the Vidharba-born runner said.
 
 Archana came home in 2:05.00, better than her previous best of 2:05.66 which she achieved while winning the silver at the Federation Cup in Patiala last month. Her reward, along with the gold, was a berth in the World Championships in London in August.
 
 But all that quickly vanished into thin air after Sri Lankan athlete Nimali Waliwarsha Konda lodged a protest and the jury ruled in her favour.
 
 Archana was moments away from being awarded the gold before her disqualification came. “I cried. I was waiting for the medallists to be called on the podium and when the announcement came through. It was shocking,” Archana said. “The Sri Lankan's leg caught me first, which is why I was pulled towards her. But my hand movement remained the same throughout the race. Anyhow, it was a technical mistake and I finished first.”
