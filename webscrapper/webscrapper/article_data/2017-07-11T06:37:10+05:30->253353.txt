SRINAGAR/LUCKNOW: Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) had hired a Hindu man from Uttar Pradesh to rob banks and ATMs, snatch weapons and kill cops in Kashmir, police said on Monday.

 Inspector General of J&K Police, Muneer Khan, said at a press conference that   from UP's Muzaffarnagar was arrested for being a member of an LeT module in south Kashmir and a close aide of the outfit's commander  , who had been gunned down in an encounter in Anantnag on July 1.
 
 “Sandeep Sharma was operating under the code name `Adil' and was arrested from the same house in Kulgam where LeT terrorist Lashkari had been killed in an encounter,“ the IGP said, adding that the 26-year-old helped Lashkari in carrying out ATM robberies and other criminal activities in south Kashmir. Sandeep's aide Muneeb Shah from Kulgam was also arrested.
 
 Sandeep reached Srinagar from Patiala in Punjab where he had gone in search of a job in 2011, police said.While working as a welder in Patiala, he got to know a cont ractor, Shahid Ahmed of Kulgam. On Shahid's insistence, Sandeep would accompany him to the Valley during summers to work as a welder. The two got into criminal activities and robbed ATMs and banks. They came in touch with LeT terrorist Shakoor Ahmed from Sopore in North Kashmir, who, in turn, introduced them to Lashkari.
 
 LeT, however, issued a statement in the evening, denying its link with Sandeep.
 
 Hang him if he's a terrorist: Brother
 
 Praveen Sharma, a resident of UP's Muzaffarnagar, is at a loss for words since he got to know of his brother Sandeep's arrest by J&K police for being a “hardened terrorist“.“Sandeep had left for Kashmir more than two years ago and as far as we know he was working there as a welder,“ Praveen, a taxi driver, added.“We are with our country. If he has become a terrorist and his involvement is established, he should be hanged.“ TNN
