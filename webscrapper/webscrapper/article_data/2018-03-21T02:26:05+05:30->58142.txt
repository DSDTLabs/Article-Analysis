NEW DELHI:   will be the first party to surrender its bungalow in Lutyens’ Delhi. Allotted to it for running the national headquarters on Ashoka Road, the 11   bungalow will be handed over to the housing and urban affairs ministry in the next one or two weeks. Arun Singh, BJP general secretary and office-in-charge, said, “It has been vacated and will be handed over to authorities soon.” 

 Sources said if BJP does so, it will put pressure on other parties to follow suit. “As of now there is no information about surrendering the bungalow. The allottee has to make the final payment for electricity and water dues before informing the ministry of vacating the bungalow,” said an official, who did not wish to be named. 
 
 Recently BJP opened its headquarters on Deen Dayal Upadhayay Marg.
