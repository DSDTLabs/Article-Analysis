CHENNAI: Indian spin legend   said on Saturday that playing   in too many T20s will erode his effectiveness. There could be a few who would agree with Bedi, but one of Kuldeep's mentors and fellow chinaman bowler -   - isn't one of them.

 “No, I don't agree with that at all. I think he should be put under constant pressure all the time and I firmly believe that he can handle it. He is young and if things don't go his way, he has got the mental aptitude to go away -think about it, learn from it -and come back stronger. I think he is a fantastic prospect for India and has a great future ahead of him,” Hogg, who played seven Tests, 123 ODIs and 23 T20s for Australia, told TOI on Sunday evening.
 
 Both Hogg and Kuldeep were part of the Kolkata Knight Riders squad in the last few seasons and the duo has often discussed their craft. “It's extremely funny when you are watching Australia play India, and want your side to do well. And then, you also have someone -who is your type of bowler - with whom you have played and you want him to do well too. Look, I am quite ecstatic about Kuldeep's performance and his steady rise,” said Hogg.
 
 Kuldeep often interacts with the 46-year-old over Skype, taking notes on how to get better. “I have always enjoyed my interactions with Kuldeep. He has a never-say-die attitude which is just so refreshing,” added Hogg. That attitude was in full display when Kuldeep cleaned up Glenn Maxwell with a wrong'un on Saturday. Kuldeep had just been hit for a boundary by Maxwell two balls earlier, but the chinaman bowler had the last laugh.
 
 According to Hogg, Kuldeep's biggest asset is that he is a quick learner. “The thing that catches your attention is that he constantly looks to get better at his craft. He has a big heart and always looks to outfox the batsmen like he did in Dharamshala. As a spinner you want to see someone who is constantly testing the batsmen,” Hogg said.
