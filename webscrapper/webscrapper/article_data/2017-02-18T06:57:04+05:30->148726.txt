GANDHINAGAR: Leaders and MLAs of the Gujarat Congress met governor   on Friday and demanded action against BJP leaders involved in the Naliya sex scandal. The Congress threatened to disrupt the coming assembly session if the Gujarat BJP government does not initiate strict action. The delegation was led by state Congress president   and leader of opposition Shankersinh Vaghela.

 Solanki said: â€œWe met the governor and demanded a judicial inquiry in the Naliya BJP leaders sex scandal, as the Gujarat government is trying mislead the investigation and save its leaders. Instead of doing justice to the victim and investigating the information she provided about the exploitation of many more women, the BJP is trying to close the issue anyhow.
 
 On one hand the BJP talks of Beti Bachao (Save the girl child) but now the time has come to save girls from BJP leaders. Naliya, Jetpur, Parul University Vadodara, Gariadhar -everywhere BJP's leaders are involved in rape and sex rackets.
