BENGALURU: The   (S), by preferring to stay out of the   and   assembly bypolls and allowing a straight fight between the   and  , was hoping to halt the juggernaut of the saffron party, which was riding high on the Modi-Shah wave in the aftermath of the UP polls.

 It proved to be a master stroke for the party, which not only made its political relevance felt but also sent out a loud message to the national parties that it cannot be ignored. The JD(S) bosses knew that by fielding a JD(S) candidate, they will only spilt the Congress votes and that, in turn, would help the BJP coast to victory. The huge victory margin which the Congress gained is clearly attributed to the absence of a JD(S) candidate, who would have easily garnered 10,000-15,000 votes. The results have given enough indication that the tacit understanding between the JD(S) and Congress will continue in the 2018 polls, at least in constituencies where the JD(S) is weak.
 
 The JD(S) feels this is the only way to stop the BJP from getting pole position in the race for the 2018 assembly election. However, these reckless political games also indicate that the regional party has accepted that it has little or no chance of capturing Karnataka single-handedly at the next hustings.
