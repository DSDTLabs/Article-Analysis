VADODARA:   acting secretary   on Wednesday batted for   for women cricketers in the country. Choudhary, though, stated that he has no role in the decision making when it comes to the annual contractual fees.

 
 “This is a matter of policy so I cannot say much about it. Also, neither I nor any BCCI office-bearer is a part of the decision-making process,” Choudhary told TOI.
 
 When asked if he believes that there should be parity when it comes to men and women cricket, Choudhary, who is in Vadodara to watch the second India-Australia women’s ODI, said, “I am for it. I believe in the concept of parity of pay for men and women’s cricket. Both the teams are growing in their performance and the growth should be reflected in their contract. I am not complaining about it. This is just my view.”
 
 The BCCI recently formulated a new annual contract for men and women players in Indian cricket. While male cricketers in Grade A+ and Grade A will get Rs 7 crore and Rs 5 crore respectively per year, women cricketers in Grade A will get Rs 50 lakh annually. Women cricketers in Grade A will be getting half the pay of what a male cricketer in Grade C gets (Rs one crore). Though the A graders in women cricket have got a good hike, many expected more parity with the men’s pay after Indian women’s team reached final of the ODI World Cup last year.
 
 When asked about the pay parity, Indian women’s cricket team vice-captain   had said that as a player their job is to focus on the game and if they play good cricket they will get everything.
