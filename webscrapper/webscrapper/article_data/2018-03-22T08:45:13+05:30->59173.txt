MUMBAI: When   was named the captain of the Indian women’s T20 side in January, she was in an unfamiliar position. For years, she played under veteran   and suddenly, she would have to lead her and the team.

 
 The 29-year-old though said she’s thoroughly enjoying the responsibility. India played superbly to win the five-match T20I series 3-1 against South Africa in February-March. When asked if she finds the job extra taxing, she replied in the negative.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “No, actually I enjoy the captaincy. Whenever I get responsibility I want to do well. I love playing with the added responsibility. To lead the country was always my dream so I feel proud,” she said ahead of her side’s opening game against Australia in T20I tri-series on Thursday.
 
 Though India were thrashed 3-0 by Australia in their ODI series and lost to England in the last year’s World Cup final, Kaur, said India will not back down from any challenge.
