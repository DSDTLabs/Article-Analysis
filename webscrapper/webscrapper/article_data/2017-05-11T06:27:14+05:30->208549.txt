SHIMLA: Himachal Pradesh power and agriculture minister   on Wednesday said that people should think   investing in schemes announced by Prime Minister  . Pension schemes, as announced by Modi, for old age people were merely done to deceive the people, he said while addressing a public meeting at Anu in Jubbal tehsil of Shimla district. 

 Slamming the NDA government for rising prices, he said rate of crude oil was Rs 120 per barrel and of petrol, which should have been around Rs 18 to Rs 20 per litre, was almost Rs 73 per litre. 
 
 Accusing the Union government of initiating income tax probe against chief minister Virbhadra Singh and his family by three central investigating agencies, he said it clearly showed the political vendetta of BJP leaders.
 
 Virbhadra, who earlier inaugurated the marketing sub-yard, said it would facilitate the local farmers and horticulturalists of 18 panchayats of the area. He said the Theog-Kharapathar-Hatkoti highway would be refurbished, widened and opened for general public at the earliest.
