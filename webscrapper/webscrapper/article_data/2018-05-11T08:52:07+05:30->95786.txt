VARANASI: Union river development and Ganga rejuvenation minister   on Thursday announced that the Rs 20,000-crore Namami Gange project will be completed by December 2019. 

 He also said that the tortoise sanctuary in the city posed no threat to the ghats along the Ganga.
 
 Gadkari, along with his cabinet colleague Uma Bharti, had convened a press conference through video-conferencing for Varanasi, Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur and Patna on Thursday. "A huge hue and cry is being raised that nothing has been done to clean the Ganga. Those who are making such claims should know it that the pace of the work on the Rs 20,000-crore Namami Gange project has been accelerated. Around 70%-80% work is expected to be completed by March 2019 while the remaining would be over by December 2019," Gadkari said .
 
 He added that 75% of the funds earmarked for the project will be utilized by March 2019, well before the notification of the Lok Sabha polls.
 
 He said that the Sisamau drain, which has brought infamy to Kanpur for causing pollution in the Ganga, would be fully tapped by October. Besides, solid waste lying on the banks of the river would be recycled to run bio fuel buses.
