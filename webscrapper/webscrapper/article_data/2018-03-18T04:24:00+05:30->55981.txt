Ahmedabad: Despite the base power tariff remaining largely unchanged, the cost of power to consumers of distribution companies affiliated with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) increased by 39% in the last decade thanks to the fuel surcharge increase.

 “The actual power tariff paid by consumers in Gujarat has risen by 39% for residential customers with a monthly consumption of 200 units. The state has the highest tariff in the country after Maharashtra. The rise is mainly on account of the fuel price and power purchase adjustment (FPPPA) increasing from 61 paisa per unit in 2007 to Rs 1.71 per unit in 2017,” said K K Bajaj, a city-based energy expert.
 
 A power company is allowed to offset any increase or decrease in fuel (coal and gas) cost by way of the FPPPA, also known as the fuel surcharge. FPPPA charges are revised every three months based on power purchase cost and are approved by GERC.
 
 According to Bajaj, the effective power tariff for consumers of GUVNL, which supplies power to all of Gujarat except Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Surat, rose to Rs 6.65 per unit in December 2017 from Rs 4.80 per unit in 2007.
 
 Apart from the base tariff, final power tariff charged to consumers also includes electricity duty, FPPPA levy, fixed charges and meter rent.
