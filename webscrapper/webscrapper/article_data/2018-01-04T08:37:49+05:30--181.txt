AHMEDABAD: For the fourth year in a row,   may not be holding student senate elections fear students. Due to procedural delay, the student senate elections have been consistently called off over the past three years. There are 10 seats in the varsity’s student senate body and so far, there have been no representations from political student bodies –   (ABVP) and National Students’ Union of India (NSUI).

 Till date, the voters’ list for the upcoming student senate elections hasn’t been prepared. It takes at least 45 days to declare elections after releasing voters’ list. Even if it is done in the upcoming week, the elections may only be declared by March, when the academic year will soon end.
 
 Every year, senate meeting is held in   University on March 31, where student senate representatives also get an opportunity to put forth issues of students. Given the present state of affairs, it appears to be unlikely that the same may happen this year. The vice chancellor of GU, Himanshu Pandya, could not be reached for comments.
 
 Top sources in the university said that it appears as though even these student bodies, who otherwise launch protests for minor issues, are not interested in the student senate elections. Inside sources in the university claim that every year, the election continues to be postponed on grounds that the process is overly delayed. 
 
 “Whenever elections are announced, there are some or the other dispute. Moreover, there is hardly any officer, who is ready to accept election duty owing to these disputes,” said the source.
 
 He added, “In fact, internal elections in colleges of the varsity have already been stopped for the post of a general secretary (GS). Instead, it has turned into a selective process and is done based on merits.”
 
 Some university officials are also of the opinion that if student elections are held in the institutes, students interested in pursuing politics can get a platform to prepare themselves.
