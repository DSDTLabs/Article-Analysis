HYDERABAD: For now, chief minister   will remain at the helm in Telangana as son   has to oversee the execution of various projects, including Mission Bhagiratha and Mission Kakatiya, according to TRS sources. Therefore, there will be no change of guard at least till the 2019 elections.

 According to the sources, even if TRS manages to get the maximum number of 17 Parliamentary seats in Telangana, what role his party would play at the Centre would depend on how the NDA and the   coalitions perform.
 
 “KCR’s reading is that no front will secure simple majority, thereby making the role of regional parties like TRS crucial in government formation. Therefore, there is no need to make changes in Telangana before that,” they said.
 
 If and when the change of guard happens in Telangana, the transition of power would be smooth and KTR will take over as chief minister from the father, said the sources. According to them, while it is true that irrigation minister and CM’s nephew   is seen as the leader with a bigger mass appeal than son KTR, there will be no power struggle when KCR decides to pass on the CM mantle. “As long as KCR remains the patriarch of the TRS, there will be no power struggle within the party,” they claimed.
 
 Another issue that is still to be resolved is the political playground for KCR’s daughter and TRS Nizamabad MP  . “The CM prefers a role at the Centre for Kavitha but if the government formation at the Centre after the 2019 elections is not to KCR’s liking, he may prefer a role for her in the state. Therefore, the issue of whether she will contest for the MP seat or   is still to be decided,” the sources said.
