Young actor Kartikey Malviya who is playing the title role of   (  and  ) show 'Shani' considers actor   Khanna as his Dronacharya. Here's why!
A year back when Kartikey was preparing for India's Best Dramebaz had enacted one of the scenes of   from the show Mahadev which was played by Tarun Khanna. Kartikey says,"When I was preparing one of the acts of Ravana I saw Tarun Sir's performance in Mahadev. I was very impressed and went ahead for the audition of India's Best Dramebaz and got selected as well. Now when I am doing Shani I cannot believe that I will be sharing screen with Tarun sir for the first time. He is playing the character of Lord Shiva in Shani. When first day he came on the set with the costume and look, I could not recognise him and later on when I told him about how I took inspiration from him he was very happy. Our bonding has become stronger now and whenever Tarun Sir comes on the set the first thing he will do is look for me. Tarun Khanna is my Dronacharya and I am his Ekalavya."
