SHIMLA: Issue of four-laning of   national highway was raised in the state assembly on Monday by Naina Devi BJP MLA Randhir Sharma, who accused the company executing the project of damaging the village roads and water sources. He said due to blasting, houses in five panchayats of Bilaspur district have developed cracks.   chief minister   announced to form a committee under Bilaspur deputy commissioner (DC) to look into the issues raised by the legislator.

 While raising the issue under Rule-62, Sharma said that because of four-lane project, water sources have dried up in five panchayats while no retaining walls have been erected after the road cutting due to which many houses are facing threat. He said local people were not provided jobs even after acquiring their land.
 
 In his reply, Virbhadra said that committee formed under   would visit the affected panchayats and elected representatives would be informed in advance so that they would remain present there to discuss problems. He also said that in the affected villages of Ghra, Bhagheri, Kenchi Morh, Thapna and Narli, the company allotted the project is constructing a tunnel. The CM said that on inspecting the project site and houses of affected people, it was found that most of the houses were old and had weak structure and that the cracks in the houses were not caused by blasting.
 
 Virbhadra said the company has already been directed for the construction of retaining wall and work has already been started, and instructions have also been issued for the repair of damaged water lines.
