The biggest surprise from this year’s National Awards winners' list has been 19-year old Bengali actor  , who won the Best Actor award for his outstanding performance as a transgender in Kaushik Ganguly’s ‘Nagarkirtan’. To accept such a role as a young actor is a brave decision and Riddhi says he played the role as a "complete woman" instead of an "unfinished woman".

 Riddhi, the son of actor   and professional dancer  , began his film career when he was 11. The actor says late national award-winning director   was a big influence when he took up the role. Ritu was reportedly a close family friend, who also endured a struggle similar to the character's in the film.
 
 ‘Nagarkirtan’ is an unconventional love saga between two transgenders, played by   and Riddhi Sen. During a recent interview, Riddhi also claimed films that highlight the sensitive issue of transgender and homosexuality, require the validation of international film festivals to draw the audience to the theatre.
