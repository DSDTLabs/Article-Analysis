GURUGRAM: Work at  , which was slated to open on March 31, is still not complete. The National Highways Authority of India has now settled on a new opening date: April 10.

 Ravinder Singh Yadav, team leader of Indian Technocrat Limited (ITL) and   engineer for the project, said, “The underpass can’t be opened on March 31 because the manufacturer of the canopy (plastic sheet) for the roof of the underpass had failed to deliver the material on time. So, the work of setting up the canopy is pending. Also, LED lights have to be installed at some points.” 
 
 According to Yadav, the work is 97% complete. “I am hopeful that by April 7, we will open the underpass for trial and on April 10, it will be thrown open for the public.”
 
 The project was conceptualised in 2007 but work on the underpass was started in 2014. Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI, Gurugram, said, “We may be able to open the Hero Honda Chowk underpass by April 10. The work is on.” On Tuesday, the NHAI officials, including Sharma, and ITL’s Yadav visited the project site to inspect the ongoing work and decided that the underpass can’t be opened on Saturday.
 
 The underpass will ease traffic movement to sectors 33-34, 9, 9A, 10 and 10A, and Sector 37 industrial area. Heavy rains in July 2016 had triggered a massive traffic jam at the Hero Honda crossing — one of the busiest on the expressway. Termed ‘Gurujam’, the situation had propelled authorities concerned to expedite the underpass project.
 
 Earlier, the project got delayed due to other reasons such as a restaurant coming in the way of construction of service roads as well as two high-tension towers of 22KV and 66KV and a petrol pump hampering construction work of the underpass and the service roads. All these three hurdles have been removed. 
 
 TOI has learnt that another inspection will of the site would be carried out before the underpass is thrown open to the public.
