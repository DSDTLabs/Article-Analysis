VADODARA: School van drivers have turned good   for trees in the sweltering heat. In a unique initiative, the drivers have ensured that the school children who travel in their vans water plants near their homes.

 The initiative began with the drivers collecting 200ml plastic bottles filled with water from schools and then giving them to children when they alighted near their homes. The children used the bottles to water a plant or a tree near their home. About 40 drivers and 900 children have been watering plants in such a way since about a month now.
 
 A van driver Pravin Chavda said that they chose smaller water bottles as they could be emptied in no time as they could be emptied quickly, were handy and occupied little space in the vans. “But this 200ml water a day is sufficient to ensure that the plants survive the scorching summer,” he said.
 
 Another van driver   said that they were contemplating to name the initiative as the ‘Jal Doot Abhiyaan’. “The children are like angels to the plants and hence the name. The bottles were also purchased from scrap dealers to ensure that plastic was reused,” he said.
 
 These drivers as well as students, most of them with the   and some with the Kelavani Vidyalaya, now plan to plant trees in monsoon. The trees will have the name of the tree and also the child who will take care of it.
