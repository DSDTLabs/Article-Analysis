HYDERABAD:   trauma of commuters triggered by a flash   continued into the first day of 2017. While there's no immediate respite from the stir, the common man on the street is at the receiving end of fleecing auto drivers and high surcharge demanded by available cabbies.

 The tussle between taxi aggregators and drivers continued on Sunday with Telangana Cab Drivers and Owners Association ( ) threatening to intensify the strike, if they don't get an assurance on   from   by January 4. In next couple of days, drivers working for taxi aggregators have also decided to pull down hoardings of cab aggregators in protest.
 
 "Cab bosses are making big promises. They are saying drivers can earn between Rs 60,000 and Rs 70,000 per month if drivers come under their wings, but this is false. Not even 1% drivers are making this kind of money and we have to bear the brunt of financiers, whom we are unable to pay back. We have begun this stir to get justice and about 98% cabs are off the roads. The situation will remain same till taxi aggregators resolve this issue," said Shiva Vulkundakar, president of TCDOA.
 
 "First two days, we concentrated on educating drivers on how they are being cheated. For this, 1500 cabbies are roaming the city and mobilizing opinion. Whenever a cab becomes available, we are booking the cab and when the driver reaches us we are requesting him to join the protest. In the next two days, we will take down Ola and Uber posters and hoardings to stop the exploitation," he said. The cabbie strike has hit commuters and burning a hole in their pockets.
 
 "Every year, on New Year's day, we make it a point to go to a nice restaurant for lunch and this year too we had plans. But for more than an hour, we couldn't find a cab. While one taxi aggregator had only shared available cabs, the surge charges are too high. So, we hired an auto and visited a nearby mall," B Sivateja, said.
