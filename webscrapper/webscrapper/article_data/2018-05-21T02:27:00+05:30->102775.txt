Visakhapatnam: Police finally cracked the gruesome murder of an unidentified woman, whose   body was found between Kothapalem and Narava under Pendurthi police station limits in Vizag city in the early hours of May 4.

 Struggling for almost two weeks to find leads into the murder, police on Sunday finally arrested the woman’s live-in   after managing to establish her identity with the help of her jewellery and CCTV footage obtained from cameras near the crime spot.
 
 The woman was identified as Kondakavuri Sujatha (32), a native of Narsaraopeta in Guntur district while the accused was identified as Rayapureddi Satish (27), who was her live-in-partner. Satish is a native of Timiram village in Visakhapatnam district. 
 
 Both the victim and the accused lived in Vizag city.
 
 DCP (South zone) T Ravi Kumar Murthy said Sujatha, a mother of two children, had separated from her husband in 2011. She came to Vizag and worked as a sales agent at a herbal centre in the city while staying at a women’s hostel. She began a relationship with Satish, who was her colleague. Later, Satish opened a photo studio at NAD junction in the city. In 2016, Sujata and Satish took a house on rent at Baji Junction and moved in together.
 
 Later, Satish and Sujatha’s relationship soured after Satish wanted to marry another girl of his community. Sujatha lodged a police complaint against Satish’s family on April 15 this year claiming they were married, and sought justice.
 
 Satish and Sujatha later parted ways; Sujatha went back to the hostel while Satish moved elsewhere. Satish however developed a grudge against Sujatha and plotted to eliminate her, police said.
