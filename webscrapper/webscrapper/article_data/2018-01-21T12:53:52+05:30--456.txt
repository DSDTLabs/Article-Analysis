PUNE: Ganesh M, a final-year BA student at a reputed college in the city, had a harrowing time last year. All students were told to submit assignments, but Ganesh and his friends were unable to find writers. Teachers told the students to fend for themselves as exceptions cannot be made. Ganesh and his friends are partly blind. 

 After their search for writers turned futile, they paid money to classmates to write their assignments. "But when we submitted these write-ups which were 60-80 pages long, we were told that we had written them very badly and will be given less marks. Some teachers even mocked us saying we were unable to finish a simple assignment. It made us wonder who was actually blind," Ganesh, who is now doing a Masters course, said.
 
 Assignments are sensitive situations for partly blind students who have no means to write them. While writers for exams are available, projects and assignments are an uphill battle.
 
 Another visually impaired student said, "There are agencies that help as exams last three hours. But writing assignments takes a lot of time and energy and carry almost 50 internal marks."
 
 Activists say there is a need to change examination laws for blind students. "Internal assignments should not be made compulsory. Instead, the marks can be assigned via a viva. But if submissions are necessary, such students should be allowed to write assignments on computers that have screen reading software," Kiran  , an interior designer who helps blind students, said.
 
 Tasgaonkar added they were making an app for a writers' database. 
 
 "The individual time tables will be uploaded to the app along with the timings so that writers can look at what time they will be available and confirm their availability to students," he added.
