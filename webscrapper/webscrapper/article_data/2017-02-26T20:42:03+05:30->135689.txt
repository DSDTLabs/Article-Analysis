Step into a world of magical spells, talking antiques, a vain villain, and a beauty out to save a beast in Disney's final trailer of their live-action film 'Beauty and the Beast'. Watch in all your childish wonder as director Bill Condon brings this classic fairy tale to life with his star cast of  ,  , Luke Evans and Josh Gad. 

 While the other teasers and trailer painted a rather grim picture of this 'tale as old as time', the new 2.22-minute clip gives us glimpses of a little bit of everything. Fans of the classic animated film will be pleasantly surprised to see this film take us back to the beginning - Belle's childhood where she developed her love for books. The trailer also gives us a peek at the scene where Belle finds the enchanted rose and learns about its significance. 
 
  
  
 
 Apart from the colour, splendour and grandeur, the trailer is also led on by eight-time Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken's magic and the beautiful new rendition of the title track sung by   and John Legend.
