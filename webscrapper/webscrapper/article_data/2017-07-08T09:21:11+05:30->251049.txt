AHMEDABAD: A team of   police arrested Tejas Trivedi, a resident of Anand, from Mumbai on Thursday. Trivedi, one of the accused in Rs 5.85 crore coal scam, was living with his relatives.

 According to Vastrapur police,  , a resident of Vastrapur and having his firm in Akik Tower, had dealt with a Bhuj-based firm Vishweshwari International from December 2013 to March 2014. During this period, Patel’s firm had asked the partners Nishant Shah and   to pay Rs 7.75 crore. The duo said that they did not have such a large amount and had asked Trivedi to provide a letter of credit (LC) to Patel’s firm. The LC was rejected by a New Zealand-based firm after which the complaint was filed.
 
 Shah had paid Rs 1.89 crore in instalments afterwards but remaining amount was due. Shah was earlier apprehended by Vastrapur police. As frauds with similar modus operandi were also registered with Sola, Ellisbridge and Madhavpura police stations, a special investigation team was formed to investigate all the cases. tnn
