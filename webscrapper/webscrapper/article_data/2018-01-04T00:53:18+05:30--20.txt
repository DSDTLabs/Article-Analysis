Tirupur: Superstar Rajinikanth found a support for his political entry from Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) leader G K Vasan. Vasan said Rajinikanth’s political plunge was his own decision.

 “It was wrong to say that someone was running Rajinikanth from behind because it was not true. He might have been directed in his films by the movie directors but in real life it was not the case,” Vasan said. He was in the city to console the parents of his party functionary, S K Prasanth, who died recently.
 
 Speaking to reporters, Vasan said, “Rajini was not new to the politics as he was in the fray for the past 30 years either directly or indirectly. He knows the depth of politics. Even, many politicians have met him and sought his advices on various issues in the politics,” he said.
 
 On a query whether TMC will ally with Rajini, Vasan said, “They were waiting for Rajini to involve in the fulltime politics. Based on his party’s policy and principles, TMC would decide on the alliance.”tnn
