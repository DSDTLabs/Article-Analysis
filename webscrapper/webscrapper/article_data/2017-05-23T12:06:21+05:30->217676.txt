PANCHKULA: A group of 10 persons in two vehicles allegedly attacked four men and a woman with sharp-edged weapons and damaged their car with baseball bats near   Gate in Pinjore in a case of road rage on Sunday night. 

 The five deputy managers in a private bank were returning from Timber Trail, a resort spread over two hills connected by a cable car in  , after spending their weekend. The assailants intercepted their car ahead of the Pinjore light point. They thrashed the four men and misbehaved with the woman. They also took away the documents of their car and valuables while damaging the car, alleged Rishi Mutneja, one of the victims. The others were his colleagues Avinash Singh, Ishan Sood, Manjit Singh and the woman
 
 Before anybody could react, the attackers escaped. The injured were rushed to civil hospital for medical examination. Pinjore police station house officer   said the car of the victims had scraped past that of the accused. However, in his complaint, Mutneja alleged the assailants misbehaved with the woman. As they objected, they started thrashing them. "We never crossed them or had any altercation that could trigger the attack,'' alleged Mutneja.
