GANDHINAGAR:   hold the purse strings of development funds. But it seems Gujarat’s collectors are holding them very tight! Most of the collectors have failed to fully utilize the Rs1 crore   and the additional Rs15 lakh to Rs1 crore of   for development works in their respective districts. 

  The miserly approach may lead to misery for people as the planning division of the state general administration department (GAD) has drastically cut the   to the districts.
 
 The state’s 33 collectors used to get Rs 33 crore as discretionary grants for executing development activities without prior sanction from the state government. After their dismal expenditure performances, GAD has now reduced the total grant on this head to Rs 13.86 crore. 
 
 The incentive grant, which the collectors get in proportion to their performances, too has been reduced to Rs 5.59 crore from Rs 16.20 crore sanctioned in April 2016. 
 
 Deputy secretary, GAD planning, Ketan Suthar has issued an order to the collectors informing them about the reduction in grants. 
 
 “Despite giving an action plan on April 13, 2016 and a request to submit administrative approvals latest by October 31, 2016, most of the district collectors have failed to do so, leading to the grants remaining unused. Considering this fact, the government has decided to reduce the discretionary as well as sanctioned incentive grants,” Suthar has ordered.
