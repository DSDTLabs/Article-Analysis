Actress   feels blessed that her journey into motherhood went as planned. She and her husband, musician  , were too busy to have a child immediately after marriage. She says, “We always wanted a child, but since we were trying to establish our careers, we decided to plan a baby after a few years. I also knew that having a baby meant we had to put everything aside for a while and attend to her.”
When the actress finally became a mother one-and-a-half years ago, she was fully prepared for it. “Nirvi is 17 months now. My husband   also shares responsibilities. It is easier to have a child in India as you have your parents around.   became the most important part of our lives and everything else was insignificant. I enjoy being a hands-on mother.”
 Though Nirvi is an infant, the actress feels that it is important to inculcate the right values in her. She says, “Children these days are intelligent. You don’t need to teach them anything. They grasp many things 
 that you say or do in front of them, so you have to be very careful. I can never say a cuss word in front of her. She happily accompanies us to the many concerts across the country and the world." 
 Nirvi seems to be gaining from all those trips with her parents to the concerts. “She has picked up many things about music from Parthiv and me in the last few months,” informs Manasi. “We have stopped doing many things that we did earlier, but we love my time with her. I also don’t like to be controlling or possessive about her. I just let her be and grow the way she wants. The time when we grew up with our parents was way different from what we share now with our children, so one has to be careful about many things. I love the time I spend with her and though I keep busy with small projects, it’s a conscious decision to not be away from her for long hours because being a mother brings happiness that is cherished forever,” she adds.
