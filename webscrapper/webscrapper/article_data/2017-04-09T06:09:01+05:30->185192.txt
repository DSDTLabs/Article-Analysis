HYDERABAD: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence ( ) officials suspect that the gang, which conspired to send methaqualone tablets to   illegally, may have been doing it for a long time and making a huge profit as the value of the drug is high in the international drug market. Methaqualone seizure was done in Hyderabad after two years. 

 The DRI officials said unidentified drug peddlers had planned to transport 2,300 methaqualone tablets, which were concealed in a cargo parcel and seized on Friday with a value of over 50 lakh in international market, while its market value in India was just 9.20 lakh. 
 
 The officials are still trying to zero in on the person who sent the courier from  . It is believed that had the drug racket not busted, the parcel would have reached Kuwait via Bengaluru airport, which deals with international cargo clearance. 
 
 Usually, at the international cargo clearance centre, surveillance would be there on products, which were being shipped, but in most cases they would be moved based on the declaration of the parcel. "We have some leads and we are working on them. As of now, we do not know where it was manufactured. Unless, the accused is nabbed, we will not get clarity,'' the DRI officials said.
