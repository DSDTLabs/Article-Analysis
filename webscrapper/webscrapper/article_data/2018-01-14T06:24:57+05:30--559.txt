CHANDIGARH: After suffering the ignominy of having the poorest child sex ratio in the country, the   government has now claimed that there has been a dramatic change in numbers in 2017. The state has claimed to have logged its highest ever sex ratio of 914 girls per 1,000 boys in 2017. The ratio was 900 per 1,000 boys in 2016 and even lower 876 in 2015. 

 The data released by the state government on Saturday shows that out of the 5,09,290 (5.09 lakh) children born in the state from January to December 2017, 2,66,064 were boys and 2,43,226 were girls. According to this data, there has been an increase of 43 points.
 
 While 17 districts achieved the ratio of 900 or more, no district was below 880 in 2017.   with a ratio of 945 tops the list, followed by   with 943. Experts say that a number close to 950 is considered ideal. In 2011, Mohindergarh, Rewari, Sonipat and   districts had a child sex ratio of below 800 but have shown a big improvement.
 
 According to CM  , this marked improvement in the sex ratio since launch of the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign by the PM from Panipat in 2015 is the outcome of concerted efforts by the state government. "The gains will most certainly show up in the 2021 census," he added.
 
 
 
 
 The government embarked on a multi-pronged drive to improve the skewed sex ratio by conducting raids on illegal ultrasound centres and decoy-trapping of ultrasound institutes,‚Äù said a senior government official. They added that around 550 FIRs were registered under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques and Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act against the offenders after raids were conducted.
 
 The officials also cracked several cases of abortion kits being sold illegally by some medical practitioners.
 
 Dr Baljit Singh Dahiya, social activist and former Director-General of Health Services, Haryana, said that he thinks change of social economic conditions and change in mindset of the people of the state is behind this improvement. "Government can't claim the success only due to conducting of raids and action against the violators of PCPNDT or MTP acts. Awareness and social campaigns are key factors to success in this field," he added.
