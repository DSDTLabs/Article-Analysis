HYDERABAD: Backward classes (BCs) candidates are going to hog the limelight as nearly 4,000 of the 12,700 sarpanch posts in gram panchayats (GPs) in   will be in their kitty in tune with the 34 per cent reservation provided for them in the local bodies.

 
 The GP elections assume significance as they would be held ahead of the assembly and   elections by this year-end or early 2019. With the TRS government firm on holding elections to the GPs before the term of the present elected bodies comes to an end on July 31, BC welfare associations are demanding that the government enhance the reservations to BCs in local bodies to 52 per cent in accordance with their population.
 
 The   is expected to complete enumeration of BC voters and finalisation of BC wards by this month-end. “To enhance the quota in the local bodies, the state need not depend on the Centre as it can bring an amendment to the Panchayat Raj Act in the legislative assembly. We had demanded enhancement of BC reservations even when the new Panchayat Raj Act was being drafted but it was not done,” national BC welfare association leader   told TOI.
 
 The GP elections are conducted on independent symbols, but parties leave no stone unturned to ensure that candidates supported by them win. All parties took special interest in ensuring that voters checked whether their names were included in the voter list during the drive by election authorities that ended on May 8.
