Singer Emeli   said she would love to start a family soon. 

 Reportedly, the 30-year-old singer said she is in a happy relationship and is thinking of having kids with her mystery man. 
 
  
  
 "I think it would be really fun. I mean, I imagine the children so perfect, like they just love watching me write songs and sitting silently. That's the dream. When I think about it there, yeah, I'd love it, I'd love children," Sande said. 
 
 The 'Hurts' hitmaker, who parted way with her childhood sweetheart   in 2014, said she is open to tying the knot for a second time as she has reached the right level of maturity to handle a marriage. 
 
 "I feel at the point in my life where I just know myself so well. I can be honest with someone if I don't like certain things, or they don't like things about me. There's maturity that I think you need for marriage and I feel like I've reached that level, I hope, now."
