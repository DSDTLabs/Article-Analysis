GAYA: Complaining against the   in the city and  , the   (CBCC) representing the   of Magadh division has sought improvement in health service delivery and infrastructural improvement to cater to the needs of more than one crore population in the region.

 The demand has been made through a representation addressed to CM  . Signatories to the representation include CBCC president SK Dalmia, general secretary Rajesh Jhunjhunwala and its former presidents Anup Kedia, Kaushalendra Pratap and Hariprakash Kejriwal.
 
 The businessmen have requested the CM to personally visit Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College (ANMMC), Pilgrim Hospital, Lady Elgin Hospital and Infectious Diseases Hospital to see things for himself as the condition prevailing in these hospitals was beyond description.
 
 Gaya based hospitals, it may be recalled, have been hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons, including lack of hygiene, shortage of doctors, absenteeism among the doctors, non-availability of basic tools of investigation, shortage of medicine, non-functional apparatus, absence of neurosurgeon and delay in the establishment of the trauma centre, etc
 
 The petition said all efforts to promote tourism in the region will not meet any substantial success so long as qualitatively better medical services are not available in the vicinity. On account of lack of medical facility, visitors, particularly foreign tourists, keep the duration of their stay to the bare minimum and appear to be in a hurry to leave the place at the earliest. Retention of tourists would be that much easier if proper healthcare was available and such availability would also facilitate increase in tourist footfall, said the petition. 
 
 The CBCC members further claim that besides infrastructural deficiencies, the medicare system in the region was also a victim of poor work culture, lack of sensibilities and non-availability of medical and paramedical staff in adequate numbers.
 
 Demanding specialized and superspeciality healthcare at the ANMMC Hospital, the petition said the introduction of postgraduate teaching in all clinical as well as non-clinical departments along with modern equipment and specialists in different spheres of treatment was urgently required.
