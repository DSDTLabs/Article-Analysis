Ahmedabad: Incessant rain since July 21 night has created a history of sorts in Mount Abu with the hill station plundered by as much as 110 inches rainfall in just four days . 

 This is the highest rainfall received in Mount Abu in the last several decades. 
 
 Heavy rain sent rocks hurtling down near Aama Hanuman, 6km from the entry toll booth. But local authorities cleared the hurdles in few hours. Officials also scotched rumours about Abu Road-Mount Abu being closed for vehicles and said they have only asked the drivers to exercise caution, especially after 6pm due to possibilities of rocks falling from the height.
 
 While there has been no major casualty in Abu, internet broadband connectivity of BSNL and other private telecom operators has been badly hit. Vodafone and Airtel have managed to partially restore services but services of BSNL remain hampered.
 
 Supply of essentials including vegetables too has been hit due to flood-like situation in adjoining places like Pali, Jhalore and other parts of Sirohi district. “Chillies are selling for Rs 80 per kg, so are potatoes,” said a local resident.
 
 All schools and colleges have been closed as per the collector’s orders as a precautionary measure. 
 
 Kashyap Jani, president of Mount Abu Hotels Association said that there are nearly 2,000 tourists. “Many from Gujarat are unable to go back due to flooding in Banaskantha,” he said. 
 
 Tourists are trying to make the most of monsoon in this Abode of Gods. “I have extended my stay by two days here. The weather is very pleasant,” said Ramchandra Kumar, a Chittorgarh resident, who came to Abu with his wife.
