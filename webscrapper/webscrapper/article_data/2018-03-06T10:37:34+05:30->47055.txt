PATNA: The reported tug-of-war between the Patna University (PU) administration and the   State Educational Infrastructure Development Corporation (BSEIDC) has compelled hundreds of   students to reside in private lodges after paying exorbitant rents.

 Two premier hostels of Patna College —   and   — were declared ‘heritage buildings’ by the state government and handed over to the BSEIDC more than three years ago for their renovation. Six months back, the contractors asked the authorities concerned to take possession of the ‘renovated’ hostels. However, Patna College principal   claimed the “renovation work is incomplete”.
 
 Keeping in view the demands of the students, the college administration appointed new superintendents for the hostels a couple of months back and allotted rooms to 100 of them. Since the hostels had “not been renovated completely”, PU registrar Rabindra Kumar wrote a letter to the BSEIDC a week ago, asking it to get all the rooms fully furnished.
 
 A college employee said several outsiders were already residing in the hostels and had even locked the rooms. They had also celebrated Saraswati Puja this year.
 
 According to PU engineer  , a sum of Rs 5 crore has been spent by the BSEIDC on the renovation of both the hostels in three years. “A number of rooms are still without doors and windows. We have lodged a complaint against the contractors for the theft of costly furniture from both the hostels. Of the 200 cots and tables, you’ll find only 50,” the principal said and added he would not take over the possession of the hostels unless they were completely furnished.
 
 Incidentally, a number of bureaucrats, academics and political leaders, including Bihar’s first CM Shree Krishna Sinha, former foreign secretary Muchkund Dubey, former CBI director Srinath Mishra, principal secretary Anjani Kumar Singh and parliamentarians Mahendra Prasad and R C P Sinha, were all boarders of these hostels.
