TRICHY: The   (TNCSC), the sole supplier of food grains for   (PDS) across the state, is unable to procure even 20% of paddy in the current 2016-17 kharif season when compared to the previous season of 2015-16, owing to severe   conditions.

 TNCSC is responsible for providing food grains, commodities for the people under PDS through ration shops. For that, it procures the products through direct procurement centres (DPC) and stores them on its own or in godowns owned by the   Warehousing Corporation. The foodgrains would then be supplied through Tamil Nadu Consumers Cooperative Federation Limited stores. 
 
 In Thanjavur district, a total of 183 DPCs were established in 10 taluk centres including Thanjavur, Pattukottai, Kumbakonam, Papanasam and Peravurani. 
 
 However, from 183 centres, officials could procure a meagre amount of paddy grains. From October 2016 till now, all the centres could purchase only 72,758 metric tonnes, when compared to four lakh metric tonnes during 2015-16, officials said. 
 
 “Due to acute water shortage, farmers could not execute their agriculture activities. They could cultivate only on a lesser number of acres. Though arrival of paddy was very less in volume, there is no shortage of grains for the public distribution system in Thanjavur district,” said senior regional manager, TNCSC, Thanjavur, Manimaran.
 
 In Thanjavur district, farmers took up kuruvai cultivation on 62,500 out of 93,932 acres. In the case of samba it was 1.82 lakh acres out of 3.30 lakh, sources said. In Nagpattinam district, coverage of kuruvai cultivation was 91,000 acres. 
 
 Whereas for samba, it was 1.54 lakh out of 2.55 lakh acres. In Tiruvarur district, farmers took up direct sowing under 2.33 lakh acres out of 3.03 lakh acres. 
 
 Though agriculture activities were executed under considerable number of acres, when it came to harvesting, they could not realise even 20% due to lack of water, farmers said. Drought restricted the arrival of paddy at the DPCs, they added.
 
 Meanwhile, in Nagapattinam, the total volume of paddy procured during 2015-16 kharif season was 3,16,084 metric tonne. 
 
 However, it is just16,235 metric tonnes during the current 2016-17 season from 54 DPCs, officials said.
