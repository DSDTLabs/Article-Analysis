Visakhapatnam: District collector Pravin Kumar has come down heavily on Scheduled Castes Corporation deputy director Ramana Murthy for not handing over compensation to the victims of the Jerripothulapalem incident even after a month after the incident.

 It can be recalled that a woman was stripped during a scuffle over a land dispute in Jerripthulapalem in Pendurthy mandal a month ago. Several other women also received minor injuries.
 
 The CPM city wing had lodged a complaint with the collector during a grievance meet on Monday at the collectorate about non-payment of compensation to the victims. They informed the collector that even after a month of the state government announcing the compensation of Rs 1.25 lakh to the victims, the money was not given to them.
 
 CPM city secretary B Ganga Rao and Kula Vyatireka Porata Samithi city secretary RP Raju alleged that the victims received a message on their phones stating that the compensation amount was deposited in their bank accounts. However, no money was deposited till date. 
 
 The families of the victims along with the CPM leaders met the collector and apprised him of their problem. The collector then pulled up the   deputy director over the isssue. Officers in the SC Corporation told the collector that certain restrictions in the treasury department had delayed the transfer of money. The collector reportedly directed the officials to hand over the money to the victims at the earliest.
