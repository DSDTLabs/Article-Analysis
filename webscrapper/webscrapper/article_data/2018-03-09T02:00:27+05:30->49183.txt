This is then used to pay the vendors and agencies supplying the mess items. This account is maintained on no-profit-no-loss basis,” the statement said.
 
 The administration also said that the mess supervisor salary is paid by the IHA from the establishment charges collected from the students at the time of registration. “The charge was revised last in 2014 to 550 rupees per semester. However, the salaries of mess supervisors have been increasing continuously due to regular revision of minimum wages of workers,” it said.
 
 Responding to the administration’s clarification, the   claimed that “none of the changes and fee hikes that the administration has imposed were passed in the IHA meeting. When the increase in the minimum wages and newspaper rates was brought to the notice, we had demanded a committee to be formed to look into the quantum of increase in charges needed to fulfil minimum wages.”
 
 The union claimed that 98.47% of the students voted against the administration in the referendum. JNUSU claimed that 4456 students voted in the referendum, and rejected the compulsory attendance in the campus.
