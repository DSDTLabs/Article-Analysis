They finish each other’s sentences, highlight each other’s achievements and look extremely comfortable with each other… on the face of it, they look like a typical couple, head over heels in love with each other. However,   actress and comedienne Sugandha Mishra denies being in a relationship with Dr  , a dermatologist-turned-comedy actor.
According to reports, Sugandha has been dating Sanket for almost a year now, and even helped him bag a few gags on 'The Kapil Sharma Show'. She says, “Sanket is a good guy and we share a great friendship, but there is no marriage happening here. We are too young to be married; we have to earn money and do well in our careers.”
 Sanket, who is popular for mimicking Sanjay Dutt and  , agrees, adding, “I met Sugandha many years ago, our friendship is quite old. There are no marriage plans. We are happy being friends. Having said that, I get attracted to women who have a great sense of humour and Sugandha has it in 
 abundance.”
 Ask Sugandha why she quit Kapil’s show to join another comedy show and she says, “I was never a regular member of Kapil’s team. I was just invited a few times to be a part of his show. On the other hand, I will be a regular member on the other show.”
