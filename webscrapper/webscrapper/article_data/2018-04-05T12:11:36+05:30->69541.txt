NEW DELHI: BJP   MP   broke rank with his party colleagues today saying he's not interested in foregoing his Parliamentary salary and allowance
  .

 
 Swamy said he was present in   on all the days in question and it isn't his fault that no business could be transacted in the House.
 
 The BJP MP's comment came after his party colleague and minister for parliamentary affairs Ananth Kumar yesterday announced that no BJP or NDA   will take salaries or allowances for the wasted days of the current session of Parliament.
 
 "I used to go daily, if House didn't run it isn't my fault. Anyhow I'm President's representative, until he says so, how can I say I'll not take my salary," said Swamy.
 
 Two NDA leaders told TOI yesterday that the decision to forego salary was a unanimous one and taken at a Cabinet meeting, also yesterday. They added that their gesture would send out a message that the opposition was responsible for the Parliamentary disruptions, they said.
 
 "We, BJP-NDA MPs, have decided to forego salary and allowances for 23 days as Parliament was not functional. Salary is to be given only if we serve people through work. Congress's undemocratic politics has made   and Rajya Sabha non-functional, in spite of our willingness to discuss," tweeted parliamentary affairs minister Kumar yesterday. 
 
 He further said that due to the disruptions, key Bills in Parliament weren't passed, which has led to a "criminal wastage" of taxpayers' money. 
 
 "We discussed the issue with the Prime Minister, BJP president and NDA constituents... The money is given to us to serve the people. Since no issue of public interest was discussed and no legislative business could be transacted, we are returning the money to the people," said Kumar.
 
 Last month, a BJP MP from Delhi, Manoj Tiwari, demanded the implementation of a "no work, no pay" rule in Parliament.
