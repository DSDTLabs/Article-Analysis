NOIDA: The Confederation of   Residents Welfare Associations (CONRWA) urged Union finance minister   on Thursday to scrap service charge on card payments.

 Stressing that the service charge was a deterrent to the Prime Minister’s cashless drive, the NCR RWA body sent a letter to Jaitley. A copy of the letter was also sent to the RBI governor and the Prime Minister.
 
 “Debit and credit cards and mobile apps are the only modes of payment to make digital transactions. However, the additional service charge of 2-2.5% levied by banks is an additional burden. This should be scrapped immediately,” said P S Jain, president, CONRWA.
