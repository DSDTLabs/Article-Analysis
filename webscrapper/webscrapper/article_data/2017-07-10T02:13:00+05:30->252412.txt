Nagpur: The special squad of women cops, under the supervisory level officers, probing the rape case of four-year-old girl by senior student during the recess of their school at Dharmapuri has already zeroed down upon two suspects. 

 Sources from rural police said the cops, on the verge of completion of their probe, have landed in a queer situation as the rape survivor, student of KG I, is not very keen to recall the episode before the investigating officers. The mood swing of the survivor has kept the cops on tenterhooks as she is yet to identify the actual culprit. However, the cops have already managed to get substantial evidence against two suspects. 
 
 According to an officer, the survivor is being counselled in order to ensure that she comes out with the identity of the senior student who had assaulted her last week. The survivor was lured by the senior student towards the rear side of the school before she was victimized. Though the survivor did not complain before the teachers at school after the classes resumed following the recess, she pointed out at her injuries after reaching home which prompted her parents to approach the Airoli police station where the offence was registered. The medical examination of the survivor too has confirmed about injuries on her private parts. 
 
 SP, Nagpur rural, Shailesh Balkawade said that every precaution is being taken to ensure the probe is taken to it’s logical end. “The suspects in the case are also students which have made the case even more sensitive,” he said.
