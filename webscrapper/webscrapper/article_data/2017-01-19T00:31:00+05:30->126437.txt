NAVI MUMBAI:   residents staged a dharna below the flyover on Sion-Panvel highway on Wednesday to   against Cidco’s   during which a Ganpati temple was razed.

 The   team, deputed by the Chief Controller of Unauthorised Construction (CCUC), cleared six acres of reserved plots meant for Project Affected Persons on Wednesday.
 
 The drive was conducted amidst protest and under heavy police protection. Residents alleged that they had no idea about the action being taken against the Ganpati temple which was there before Cidco acquired the land in Kamothe. “We can understand Cidco demolishing chawls but bulldozing such old temple was uncalled for,” said  , a local resident.
 
 The protesters were overpowered by cops, paving way for demolition of five chawls and the Ganpati temple, located in sector 6A. The chawl owner, Atmaram Mhatre, was given notice under MRTP Act but paid no heed to it.
 
 “This compelled us to pull down illegal structures. The temple had cropped up a few years back on PAP land,” said S R Rathod, assistant controller of CUC, Cidco. Several illegal brick kilns were also razed.
 
 The impromptu protest also highlighted the inconvenience caused due to delay in completing the road connecting Sion-Panvel highway to Kamothe. PWD sources said that the delay was caused due to obtaining permission from forest department, as the expansion comes under mangrove zone. They added that clearance from forest department was in process and work would be completed in two months.
