BHOPAL: CBSE controller of examinations K K Choudhury on Monday told TOI that the board will compensate students of Class X for the error in the English question paper, which confused students across the county. Even those who didn’t attempt the question will get the benefit.

 The English language question paper on March 12 this year came in for criticism over an error in the passage section. Students were expected to find synonyms of certain words in paragraphs two, four and five whereas the in answers were in paras three and six.
 
 “It was a typo, which led to the confusion. We have taken note of it. We will ensure no student is put to disadvantage. The board will take care of the error at the time of marking,” Choudhury told TOI over phone from New Delhi. Asked if the board would consider other mistakes highlighted by students, Choudhury said a CBSE team is on the job to assess “typo errors”. He said, “The benefit would be for all students. Once we are done with the preparation of the marks scheme, we will decide on the compensation marks. We will not let any student suffer because of a mistake at our end.”
 
 Earlier, there was a WhatsApp message going around that CBSE has decided to give 2 compensatory marks for the error. However, top officials said the quantum hasn’t been decided yet.
 
 Some students have pointed out another typo in the paper, where the word ‘or’ was missing between parts of two questions, triggering confusion in the exam hall. Some students, including a few in Bhopal, started online petitions for compensation for the passage error. Over 16 lakh students are taking the Class 10 examination this year.
