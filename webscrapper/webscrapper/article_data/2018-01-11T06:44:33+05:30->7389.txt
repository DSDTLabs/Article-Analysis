CHENNAI:   A grade office space resulted in a 12% year-on-year dip in office space absorption in 2017, says a latest report on office space absorption brought out by realty firm Knight  .

 “Just 4.5 million sqft of office space supply since 2015 beginning, compared to 14.6 million sqft of transaction volume, has pushed down vacancy levels from 22.5% in the first half of 2015 to 10.2% in the second half of 2017,” said Kanchana Krishnan, Knight Frank Chennai director, while releasing the report.
 
 The supply crunch in office space market eased slightly with 1.8 million sqft coming online in 2017, but it was still not enough to stem the fall in vacancy, she said. A sharp fall – from 43% to 25% - in the share of IT/ITeS sector in the overall office space absorption was a matter of serious concern, she said. Meanwhile,   and other service sectors almost doubled their share of absorption and office space rental grew by about 4.5% in 2017, said Krishnan. The supply crunch and dropping vacancy levels contributed to increase in rentals, she said. In comparison, Mumbai saw 10.4 million sqft of new supply, Bengaluru 8.1 million sqft and   4.1 million sqft. Even Hyderabad did better than Chennai with 3.2 million sqft of new office space supply.
 
  
 As against absorptions of 5.1 million sqft each in 2015 and 2016, Chennai saw just 4.5 million sqft of absorption in the office space market in 2017, she said. Bengaluru once again peaked with 11.7 million sqft of office space absorption, followed by Mumbai at 7.5 million sqft, NCR 6.4 million sqft and Hyderabad 5.7 million sqft.
 
 The decline in office space absorption would continue all through 2018 also, said Olympia Group MD Ajit Kumar Chordia. “When quality office space supply reduces, absorption is bound to fall. But it will pick up in 2019 with about 25 million sqft of new supply coming into the market. It could even lead to oversupply for a couple of years,” said Chordia.
 
 He said Chennai and Hyderabad were bound to grow with many IT firms looking beyond Bengaluru owing to the infrastructure bottlenecks in that city. “While Hyderabad capitalised on the opportunity, Chennai failed to showcase its potential properly. As a result, Hyderabad, which was lagging behind Chennai in office space absorption for years marched ahead of Chennai last year. Hyderabad may touch 7 million sqft absorption in 2018,” said Chordia.
