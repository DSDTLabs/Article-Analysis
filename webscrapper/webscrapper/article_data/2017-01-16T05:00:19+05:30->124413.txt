MUMBAI: If   corporator   is fielding his wife for the civic polls,  's Nandkishore Vichare has decided to campaign for the candidate the party will propose in his place as his seat is now reserved for  . 

 Both represent constituencies in the F-South ward (Dadar, Parel, Naigaum, Lalbaug and Sewri). While More represents ward 195, which after   is ward 200, Vichare represents ward 197, which is 202 now. 
 
 More is swapping his ward with Congress corporator Pallavi Mungekar as his ward has been reserved for scheduled caste women. Mungekar's ward, on the other hand, is reserved for women, which will enable More to field his wife. "My wife is not active in politics, but is well aware of civic issues," he said. 
 
 Vichare is a one-term corporator, but is clear he won't seek a ticket for his wife or any other woman relative. His ward 202 is reserved for women in the open category. "We have several deserving women party activists. I will work whole-heartedly for whoever the party chooses to nominate."
 
 Two-term Sena corporator Sanjay Ambole is keen that the party field his wife from his ward (203) that is now reserved for women. "I have worked hard in my constituency and my wife will certainly win," he said.
 
 Local Sena MLA Ajay Choudhari said it was unfair to obtain a ticket for one's wife when women party members work equally hard. "When I went to jail over the Veer Savarkar issue, two women party activists also went to jail with me. Why should a ticket be denied to such women?"
