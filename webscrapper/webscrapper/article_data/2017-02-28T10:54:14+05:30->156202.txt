PANAJI:  , along with a few  , will down their shutters on Tuesday with nearly 2,500-3,000 bank employees including officers going on a one-day strike. Conciliation discussions between   (UFBU) and the   (IBA) failed to arrive at a consensus prompting the UFBU to urge bankers across the country to go on strike.

 “In the light of the increasing attacks on account of the government’s anti-public sector policies, all the employees and officers in all the banks, have given a call for one-day strike. We want legitimate compensation for employees and officers for extra hours of duty performed on demonetization work,” Goa Bank Employees Association general secretary  , said.
 
 The bankers have also decried the finance ministry’s lack of support for public sector banks. “When banks are facing challenges, the government has announced recapitalization of just 10,000 crore in the Budget. This means that either the business of the banks will get choked or banks will be compelled to tap private capital from the market thus diluting public sector character,” Pereira said.
 
 All public sector banks along with a few small private sector banks will participate in the strike. Large private banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis and Yes Bank, and Goa’s cooperative banks have not supported the strike.
