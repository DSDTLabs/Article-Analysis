Lucknow: The   proctor team conducted a surprise inspection of Habibullah, Subhash and Mahmoodabad hostels on Saturday evening following complaints that outsiders were harassing the mess incharge. Though nobody was caught, officials said a constant vigil would be maintained.

 In the afternoon, the mess incharge lodged a complaint that for the past few days, outsiders had been coming during lunch and dinner time and forcing him to serve food. “As a result, food for hostel residents fell short,” he said. He also said that people misbehaved with him when he tried to show them university rules. Some hostel residents also supported them. 
 
 The surprise inspection was conducted at dinner time at 8.40pm. It lasted for about two hours. However, outsiders did not turn up on Saturday. “We will keep a constant vigil and conduct rounds to ensure law and order are restored,” said chief proctor Vinod Singh.
