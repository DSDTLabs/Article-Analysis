LUCKNOW: With   withdrawing from its duty of garbage collection from Wednesday, several houses and colonies have already started facing problems with heaps of garbage accumulating on roads in front of their houses. 

 
 Food and plastic waste from   bhandaras on Tuesday further added to the piling trash. The company has declared it will completely stop door-to-door garbage collection from June 1. 
 
 Colonies in areas such as Alambagh, Aashiana, Aminabad, Thakurganj, Vikasnagar, Aliganj, parts of Indiranagar, Hussainganj and Khurramnagar complained that garbage was not picked from their houses. 
 
 A few people also claimed that Eco-Green staff had been appearing only once a while over the past three months, leading to accumulation of garbage heaps in front of their houses. Because of the staff's strike, garbage from roads was dumped on the sides and remained there.
 
 Eco-Green has already announced that because of non-payment of dues by  , it does not have money to buy fuel to run garbage collection vehicles. 
 
 As a result, at most locations, waste dumped on roadsides was not picked. The company said that 60% of its transfer stations- where garbage from the city is brought before being sent to a plant-had shut down on Wednesday. 
 
 The Shivri waste treatment plant, which generally treats 1,200 metric tonnes of garbage daily, on Wednesday worked for only four hours and treated only about 400 metric tonnes of garbage. 
 
 The winds further spilled uncollected trash on the roads. TOI spotted dozens of littered spots like sector Q crossing of Aliganj, sector D of Janakipuram, area near KD Singh Babu stadium and New Hyderabad. 
 
 A garbage dump in Niralanagar was so huge that it had to be burnt to clear the mess. 
 
 Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia has intervened and spoken to company officials in Delhi to have the services resumed at the earliest.
