PANAJI:   have unveiled plans to set up   and temporary floating jetties at Arossim, Benaulim, Mobor and Palolem to commence ferry cruises for tourism and coastal travel.

  The project’s approval has been kept on hold till the coastal zone management plan can be finalized, a Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority source said.
 
 “These ferry services will link with the inland waterways system,” said chief executive officer, Drishti Cruises and Ferries Pvt Ltd, Ravi Shanker. Infrastructure to be installed in the inter-tidal zone comprises a fixed and floating walkway from the beach, ranging from 30m- 60m at the four beaches.
 
 The floating section ranges from 50m-100m, culminating in a floating platform for boarding passengers. The walkways are to be located in CRZ I area, while the floating jetty and floating platform are beyond the low tide line - a CRZ IV area. Walkways ranging from 60sqm-120m and 180m-240m will occupy beach area.
 
 “Government has not given thought to the impact on local communities,” said president, Goenchea Ramponkarancho Ekvott, Agnelo Rodrigues.
