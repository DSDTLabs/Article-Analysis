NEW DELHI: There was a reversal of role at   on Monday with the   Congress supporting a move and the ruling   opposing it. 

 It was about extending the contract of a manpower agency that supplies 250 support staff to the corporation. It was brought by   commissioner Mohanjeet Singh as an ‘urgent business’. But it failed to pass. 
 
 While this would affect those contractual employees whose service contracts expire on January 31, it might also cripple the working of the corporation. 
 
 “These employees perform data entry work assigned to them by the authorities. They are engaged in the physical maintenance of the record section: they carry files and other materials within the building, photocopy papers, open and close rooms, driving officials’ vehicles, etc. Without them it would be unimaginable for us to conduct the business of the corporation at all,” said an official.
 
 Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited, a joint venture between the Government of India and Telecommunications Consultants India Private Limited, signed a contract with EDMC in 2013. The contract expired on September 30, 2016, but was extended for four months. “The agency was empanelled to mitigate the problem of shortage of staff. The contractual workers are paid almost 30% of what a regular worker would be paid. It is economical for the corporation,” said an official.
 
 The BJP councillors led by leader of the House, Sanjay Jain, vociferously opposed it despite the commissioner making multiple appeals to them. 
 
 “I supported the extension. The BJP councillors opposed it because they want their cuts,” said  , leader of opposition.
 
 Jain rejected the allegations of corruption. “We want to explore better options,” he said. Commissioner Singh said he would go to the LG.”
