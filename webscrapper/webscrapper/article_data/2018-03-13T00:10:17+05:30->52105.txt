MADURAI/CHENNAI: The death toll in the forest fire that struck an unsuspecting group of trekkers from   on Sunday at   in   district rose to 10, including six women, on Monday. Sixteen others are undergoing treatment at hospitals in Madurai and neighbouring places for varying degrees of burn injuries, while 10 from the group have returned home after being administered first aid.

 In all, 23 people were evacuated in a massive rescue operation throughout Sunday night, involving over 250 personnel of fire, police and revenue departments besides the Indian Air Force.
 
 Several of the injured — they were brought down the hill using bed sheets tied to wooden logs — were given first aid before being shifted to secondary and tertiary care centres. Only three people from among the 39 members on the expedition remained unscathed as they were not present at the scene of the fire.
 
 Early in the morning, an air force team led by flight lieutenant Manohar from Sulur in Coimbatore swung into action in airlifting the bodies as well as dousing the fire by spraying chemicals. An unmanned aerial vehicle (drone) was used to check for anyone who may have been trapped in the forest.
 
 Meanwhile, it has come to light that the forest department was caught napping when initial alerts of the fire were sent out by the   at 11.20 am on Sunday. This was after the FSI’s remote sensing sensors detected a “thermal anomaly” near Bodi in Theni. In the next three hours, two more alerts were sent by the central organisation based in Dehradun which were, however, ignored. It wasn’t until 4.30 pm — five hours after the first alert — that the state forest department finally reacted. 
 
 According to locals, the fire occurred on Sunday noon. S Sekar, a labourer in an estate at Kolukkumalai, was one among the first to reach the spot. He said that while minor fire incidents usually take place once or twice a year, he had not seen a blaze as intensive as this.
