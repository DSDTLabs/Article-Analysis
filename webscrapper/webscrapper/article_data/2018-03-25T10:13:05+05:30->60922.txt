PUNE: The   ( ) has scrapped the plan to set up e-toilets in its jurisdiction due to lack response from a private company that had shown an interest in providing the facility under its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activity, a senior official from the board told TOI.

 As part of the pilot project, the board had planned to set up the toilets in crowded areas particularly on MG Road and  .
 
 A senior board official, who did not wish to be named, said, “A private firm had approached the board and shown an interest to set up the facility under its CSR activity last year but we failed to provide them land as some of the local Ganesh mandals had opposed the move in the past.”
 
 Last year, a group of officials from the board’s health department, accompanied by vice president Atul  , had visited Navi Mumbai to understand the benefits of the toilets.
 
 Gaikwad explained, “We had initiated the tender process but we did not get the desired response so we had to recall the tender but that too did not get a response. We will table this issue in the next board meeting again.”
 
 The board has constructed over 50 public toilets at different locations across six wards. However, users often complain about lack of hygiene. Women have also brought up issues related to lack of safety while using the washrooms at night.
 
 Board officials admit that they need to look beyond building public toilets to resolve the sanitation issue. “Public toilets are difficult to maintain and most aren’t used much. This is why we must encourage people to construct toilets in their own homes to ensure the safety and security of women, and cut down our costs,” said a senior official of the board.
 
 A senior official from the engineering department added, “The board has made a special budgetary allocation for repairs of public toilets. At some places, work has already started on drainage system, plumbing, and so on.”
