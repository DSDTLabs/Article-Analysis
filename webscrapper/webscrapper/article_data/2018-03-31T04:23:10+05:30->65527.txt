MUMBAI:Almost after a decade or so, the   has woken up and realized that the burgeoning city needs more water tanker filling points for its fire engines. 

 The civic body recently increased the number of tanker filling spots to 50; most of them are in areas where water pressure force is high. Until now, the city had only 18 such spots and the shortage has been felt acutely over the past couple of months when the number of fire calls zoomed, especially in the aftermath of the   blaze of last December. 
 
 Water tanker filling points play a crucial role during firefighting operations as engines need to be well stocked with water to be douse flames. Tankers refill fire engines and when they run out of water, they need to quickly go and stock up from the nearest point. Many a times, it is seen that these points are far away and operations are hit due to the delay in refilling. A fire official said a map showing the 50 refill points has been put up in all control rooms and those present there will direct water tanker drivers to the nearest water spot. 
 
 A civic official from BMC’s hydraulic department said, “The   had told us about the shortage they would face during emergencies. We therefore started identifying areas with high-pressure and uninterrupted water supply.” 
 
 A fire engine requires 4,500 litres of water and a tanker carries 9,000 litres. 
 
 “It is also important that the tanker fills up fast as the vehicle needs to go back quickly,” said a official. Some areas where these new points have come are Saboo Siddique Road near  , near a petrol pump in Nariman Point, Azad Maidan, near a flyover in Andheri (east) and   Water Works Yard. 
 
 Chief fire officer P S Rahangdale termed the allotment of 32 new points as a much-needed move. 
 
 “We had discussed the issue with the water department officials and coordinated with them to get the number of filling points increased,” he said.
