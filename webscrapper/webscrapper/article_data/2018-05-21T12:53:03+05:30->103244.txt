RAIPUR: In a major Maoist ambush, seven   were killed on Sunday when rebels triggered a powerful improvised explosive device (IED) blast near Cholnar village in insurgency-hit Dantewada district in tribal Bastar region of Chhattisgarh. 

 The Maoists laid an ambush in the forest area near Cholnar village and triggered a powerful IED blast targeting an SUV in which seven security personnel of   (CAF) and district force were travelling from Kirandul to provide security at a road construction site. The blast was so powerful that the vehicle was ripped apart, creating a 10-feet crater on the ground. Deputy inspector general of police (south Bastar range) Ratanlal Dangi confirmed that five security personnel were killed on the spot while two critically injured were taken to the nearest medical facility, but both of them succumbed to their injuries. 
 
 After the blast, the Maoists opened indiscriminate fire and looted weapons, including two AK 47 assault rifles, two INSAS rifles and two self-loading rifles (SLRs) from the security personnel before retreating into the dense forests. 
 
 Four personnel of Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF) and three personnel of district force were among the dead. The deceased have been identified as head constable Ramkumar Yadav, constable Tikeshwar Dhruv, assistant constable Saligram Sinha, head constable Vikram Yadav, constables Arjun Rajbhar, Ravi Patel and Rajesh Singh. 
 
 As per standard operating procedure, security personnel are normally advised against using vehicles in the insurgency-hit areas of Bastar in view of growing incidents of Maoists targeting vehicles being used by the security forces in the past. The latest attack has put the security apparatus on maximum alert in Bastar as CM   is scheduled to visit nearby Bachcheli area to address a public meeting on May 22.
