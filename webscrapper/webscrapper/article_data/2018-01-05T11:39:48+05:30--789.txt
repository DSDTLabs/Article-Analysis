BHARUCH/SURAT: Salinity problem has returned to haunt the industries of   and Vilayat which are facing water crisis with Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation ( ) stopping water supply to them from its borewells. 

 The supply was stopped due to high level of total dissolved solid in the underground water seawater gushing into Narmada river and contaminating the source. 
 
 The saline water contaminated the water of borewells of GIDC, Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers Company and many other companies in Bharuch, Dahej and Vilayat industrial estates. The GIDC officials informed the industries about stoppage of water supply from Wednesday 8 pm to Friday 6 am in view of high level of TDS which will not allow the pumps to operate,   president M A Hania said.
 
 He said more water discharge from   during high tide days is the only solution to ensure smooth water flow as it had been in the past four years, particularly in the period from January to June. The industries in Dahej and Vilayat had to stop production in their units because of poor quality of water in the past. The TDS level on Wednesday was around 1,600 mg/litre, which got reduced to around 1,200 mg.litre on Thursday afternoon. The situation is expected to normalize by Friday evening. 
 
 Dahej and Vilayat GIDC industries associations will also make representations to the state government to permit more water be released from Sardar Sarovar Dam for industries, particularly during the days when there is high tide in the sea, Hania added.
