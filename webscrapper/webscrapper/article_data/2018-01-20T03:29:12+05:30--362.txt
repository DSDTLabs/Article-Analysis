THANE: The anti-extortion cell has arrested a BJP corporator from Dombivli along with two accomplices for giving a contract to eliminate another corporator, Kunal Patil.

 Corporator Mahesh Patil along with Sujit Nalawade and Vijay aka Valya Bakade were picked up from the sessions court premises in Kalyan, said RV Kothmire, inspector of the anti-extortion cell.
 
 Patil had earlier moved an anticipatory bail plea in the sessions court which was rejected. Hence, he approached the Bombay HC for relief, but it was rejected there too, and he was told to surrender before the anti-extortion cell, Kothmire informed TOI.
 
 The   said the trio had been absconding for more than a month.
 
 The police said, “Both Mahesh Patil and Kunal Patil have been locked in a game of one-upmanship in Dombivli since the past couple of years. This has even led to murders on either side.” It is also learnt that scuffles often broke out between both sides during KDMC’s general body meetings.
 
 The officer said Mahesh Patil is prime accused in the murder of Kunal Patil’s cousin. “The case is presently sub-judice and Patil is trying to create fear in the minds of the witnesses, including Kunal Patil.”
 
 Mahesh Patil and his aides have been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for criminal conspiracy, abetment to murder and for causing hurt through provocation. They have also been charged under the Arms Act for possession of arms. A couple of years ago, Kunal Patil had been arrested for allegedly giving Rs 1 crore ‘supari’ to bump off Mahesh Patil.
