KOLKATA: Investigators probing the   sub-plot in the   are now looking into an as-yet-uncovered link — the details of Rs 15-crore transaction in the Madam   file now points towards another woman director in the group, Seema Singh. 

 The woman, who has been untraceable since August, 2015, was the second-in-command after Rose Valley boss Gautam Kundu was arrested. She was addressed as “madam” by the Rose Valley employees.
 
 Singh’s name surfaced after sleuths started tracking the Rose Valley directors known to a chartered accountant based out of Kolkata. The CA was linked to three arrests made by   from Mangoe Lane last December in connection with a hawala transaction. Cops found that it was not Subhra alone, but the CA too was well known to Singh. The details in the   files spoke of Rs 15 crore paid to a woman director. While sleuths have prima facie zeroed in on Subhra, they are not ruling out chances of Singh’s involvement in the payments.
 
 According to sources, a cash transaction of Rs 15 crore was linked to a woman director in 2013-14. The file also mentions an interest component of 11.5-12%, which was paid to the director in cash. Investigators feel that Rs 15 crore was kept like a principal component by the director. But the amount was not kept as a fixed deposit, but rotated through some operations and the interest component was generated from that. The interest was later paid to the beneficiary director. The key to the case lies in zeroing in on the woman who was actually receiving the “interest”.
 
 Kolkata Police on Monday said Subhra was interrogated at her residence for hours on Sunday. Sources said she told investigators she was unaware of any business conducted by the Rose Valley group. While she was a director of several Rose Valley group companies, Subhra was kept out of the loop. Subhra has also told investigators that she used to take money for expenses from her mother-in-law after Kundu was arrested by ED in March 2015.
