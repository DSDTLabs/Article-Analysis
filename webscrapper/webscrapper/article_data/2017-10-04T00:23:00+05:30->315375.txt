Tirupur: The district rural police are yet to make a breakthrough in the murder of a woman on September 28 on one of the service roads of Kochi-Salem national highway at Sengapalli. The woman’s child was found near the body and rescued by the police. Investigations revealed that the woman was from Tamil Nadu. 

 Since the post-mortem process was over, the police have decided to bury the corpse on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the rescued toddler, who is believed to be her son, is being taken care of at a private children home. On September 28, a few morning walkers found the body of the young woman at Sengapalli. The baby was sitting next to the body. The Uthukuli police have registered the case as murder. 
 
 “Our preliminary investigations suggested that she could be a native of Tamil Nadu and not from any state in the north. But we are yet to make a breakthrough in the case. We hope that we will get lead once the post-mortem report comes,” a police officer told TOI. “We have decided to bury the body as we have waited for a reasonable time and also because we do not need the corpse for further investigations. Right now, it is kept at the mortuary of the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and we will bury her with the help of a non-government organisation on Tuesday.”
 
 “The baby, who was assumed to be one-and-a-half years old, was found to be affected with orthopaedic disability, so he may take more time to walk. He was continuously crying since he arrived in the home. He hardly responds to our caretakers. He is yet to be trained to consume any solid food. We have to wait and see how his development is going to be,” said a source at the private home, where the baby is kept at.
