Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Wednesday rapped   for its failure to provide good infrastructure and elementary   at the college   situated in its Fort campus.

 “That there is a crisis situation in University of Mumbai is no ground not to provide elementary facilities,” said a bench of justice Abhay Oka and justice  . 
 
 It heard a public interest litigation highlighting the issue. The tribunal deals with cases such as termination of service, supercession, suspension among others of private colleges affiliated to the Mumbai University.
 
 The petition said that the presiding officer, although a retired judge of the high court and entitled to facilities at par with sitting the high court judges, is not given proper accommodation and car. 
 
 The bench noted that the tribunal was set up in August 1995 but till date it lacks infrastructure and staff. “It is a pathetic state of affairs,’ it added. 
 
 The court appointed judicial officer’s report confirmed that the facilities were dismal. Pathak’s advocate Uday Warunjikar said posts of stenographer and clerk-cum-typist is vacant and this delays dictation of orders.
 
 Mumbai University’s advocate said that a meeting will be held between the acting vice-chancellor and the presiding officer to resolve the issue. Posting the hearing on October 11, the judges said the decision on infrastructure issue of the college tribunal will be applicable to other college tribunals in the state.
