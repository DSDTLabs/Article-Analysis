GURUGRAM: The suspect who ran over a special police officer (SPO) on the Old Gurgaon-Delhi road last week. has been arrested. 

 Police claimed that the man was illegally carrying alcohol and crossing state borders and didn’t want to get caught. Ghanshyam, who was drunk while he was driving from Gurgaon to Noida, was arrested from UP’s Farrukhabad on Saturday, police said.
 
  “He was arrested from Harsinghpur in Faridabad where he had fled after his car hit the cop,” police said. Cops said that they traced the original owner of the car to Gurgaon’s Sangrur but the car had been sold as many as five times after that. 
 
 However, the owner’s name had not been changed on the records and only the RC (registration certificate) had been amended using affidavits. 
 
 Police are also on the lookout for one Suresh Sharma, an alcohol seller in Noida, under whose instructions the driver had visited Gurgaon. 
 
 SHO of Palam Vihar police station Vikram Nehra, who is investigating the case, said, “The accused was carrying illicit liquor and was headed to Noida. He has confessed to the crime. We have managed to procure four days remand and are interrogating him.”
 
  According to police, they have not yet figured out which part of the city the alcohol was procured from. 
 
 According to sources, this is not the first time that Sharma was getting alcohol from Haryana to UP. As many as 20-25 crates of liquor were inside the SUV at the time of the hit-and-run, police said, adding that Sharma had acquired the car four months ago. “We are trying to track down Sharma who has gone underground,” they added. 
 
 The white Mahindra Xylo, which claimed the life of 35-year-old Mukesh Kumar, also had a brush with another car on the same night, sources said. 
 
 Mukesh Kumar, who had joined the   only six months ago, died in hospital last week after the SUV crashed into him as he was setting up a barricade, along with another police constable.
