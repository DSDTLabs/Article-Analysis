 Toorkey’s TV show 'Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyaar…Kya Karein' may have failed to pique viewers’ interest — it did not fare well on the ratings chart —- but the actor’s sure being talked about for his ‘friendship’ with Surbhi Jyoti.
 
 Sources say that the two have been dating for some time now. “They grew fond of each other on the sets of ' ', in which Varun had a small role. Recently, they were spotted together at the show’s bash. That’s not all; when Varun celebrated his birthday on January 8, he and Surbhi played perfect hosts. They were spotted holding hands throughout the party. It was obvious that there’s more to their friendship. Surbhi has also tried recommending him for other projects. ”
 
 However, Varun chose not to comment on his love life. “I don’t think people should speculate about my relationship with Surbhi. It’s personal and people should leave us alone,” he said. When asked if he is single, the actor answered with a counter query — “Why should I tell anyone if I am dating someone or not?” Surbhi also chose to not respond to our text messages.
