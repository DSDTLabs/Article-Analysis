 In Delhi-NCR, rainfall would be quite light. The weather system would start from Thursday evening, the official said. The maximum temperature is expected to hover between 35 °C and 36°C, with winds keeping the hot weather in check. “But after Friday, we will witness an abrupt rise in mercury. We are also going to see very clear skies until April 24-25.”
 
 The maximum temperature on Wednesday was recorded at 38°C while minimum temperature was 24°C.
