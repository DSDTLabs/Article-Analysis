HYDERABAD: Passengers travelling on IndiGo   6E 886 between Kolkata and Hyderabad on Thursday evening were hit by turbulence due to the heavy rains that lashed the city. The high wind speed did not allow the flight to land in its first attempt, said passengers.

 
 According to passengers, a few members of the   cricket team were also on board the flight which landed more than 30 minutes after the expected time of arrival. “The pilot made announcements saying that the flight will descend and landing was attempted. But a few minutes later, the pilot made another announcement saying that due to heavy winds, we could not land. The flight which departed from Kolkata at 2pm was supposed to land at 3:50pm. After landing at 4:20pm, we were forced to wait inside the aircraft for 30 minutes. Flight attendants said that due to the heavy rains, the doors are unsafe to open,” said  , a passenger.
