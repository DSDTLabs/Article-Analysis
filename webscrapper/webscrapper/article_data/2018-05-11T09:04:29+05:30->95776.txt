HOWRAH: A 24-year-old TV serial actor was allegedly   in the subway of Howrah station's old complex late on Sunday. The accused,   Sonkar, a taxi driver, was arrested on Sunday night after the victim lodged a complaint. He was produced at a Howrah court on Monday and was sent to police custody. 

 
 The actress was returning to her city apartment after visiting her Bhadreswar house around 10.20pm on Sunday night when she crossed paths with Pappu in the subway.
 
 According to the actress, Pappu offered her a ride on his taxi. She added: "I told him it depends on me whether I will take a taxi or not. And, if I did, I will board a taxi of my choice. I also told him that I don't wish to be guided by him about which taxi to board. This enraged him. He then started pulling me by the hand and when I protested, he started abusing me. I was surprised that no other commuter came forward to help though the subway was full of people at that hour. Moreover, his breath smelt of liquor."
 
 The actress further said: "I was even more surprised when he shouted and two to three fellow taxi drivers heeded his call and came towards me. The driver - who had earlier pulled my hand - now punched me on my chest. He also tried to kiss on my cheek. Scared, I screamed aloud.   (RPF) officers as well as GRP policemen, who were posted nearby, rushed to the spot. Some commuters also mustered the courage to come forward on seeing the cops. The   and GRP cops overpowered the taxi driver and took him to Howrah GRP police station. 
 
 The OC of the police station,  , identified him as Pappu Sonkar. The actor then lodged a complaint of  , physical assault and unlawful obstruction. Pappu was arrested on these charges on Sunday night and remanded in police custody on Monday.
 
 Regular commuters said taxi drivers remain stationed in the Howrah station subway every evening and force commuters to board their taxis. This has become a menace.
