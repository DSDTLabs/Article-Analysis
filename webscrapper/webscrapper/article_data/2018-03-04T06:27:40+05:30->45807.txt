 "The area is being frequented by more and more people - especially youngsters. Those returning home after work from Sector V, too, form a chunk of this crowd. According to police, the arrangement, for the time being, will include a six patrol vehicles, including three police bikes. "This security cover will be in place only between Friday and Sunday and near those eating joints and shopping malls which witness maximum footfall," explained an officer.
 
  "We have been experimenting for the past two weeks and have now arrived at a consensus on how many men need to monitor the roads based on footfall," said an officer. DC (southeast)   confirmed the news, but refused to share details about the arrangements.
 
 Sources said that the seniors may soon lay out instructions for the patrol cops in these areas to follow set SOPs. The cops will also identify the 'dark spots' - areas prone to crimes and attack on cops - and undergo extensive training before they venture out to patrol them.
