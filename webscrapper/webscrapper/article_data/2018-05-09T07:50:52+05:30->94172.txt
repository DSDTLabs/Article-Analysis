SRINAGAR: The ongoing attacks on tourists by stone-pelters, the latest being the assault on a family from   on Srinagar-Gulmarg road on Monday in which a 22-year-old was killed, has hit the tourism industry badly, adding to its pre-existing slump this season in the valley. 

 Hotels in Kashmir have only 10 to 15% occupancy as compared to around 40% occupancy during the same period in 2017, Mustaq  , chairman of   and Kashmir Hoteliers club, told TOI.
 
  
  
 
 Wide media coverage of frequent mob rioting, stone-pelting incidents and violent encounters between terrorists and security forces have been keeping tourists away from Kashmir. Though the situation started improving in 2017 but the sudden spurt in violence in the valley, particular in south Kashmir, has affected the occupancy, Chaya said.
 
 Kashmir valley has over 7% stakes in tourism sector which, in a good season, earns the state Rs 1500 crore in revenue.
