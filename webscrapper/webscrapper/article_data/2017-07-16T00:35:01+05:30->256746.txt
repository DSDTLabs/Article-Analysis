KOLKATA: Gone are the days when not everyone could own and admire expensive works of eminent painter Jogen Chowdhury. The city is set to witness a unique street-art festival, where Chowdhury will supervise a team of renowned professional artists, who will make murals to enrich walls in prominent locations of the congested city.

 This beautification initiative called ‘Kolkata   Festival’ kicked off on Saturday.
 
 Murals and urban art have been documented in parts of the city for the last few years, with some attractive installations in  . This festival will celebrate the works of 15 artists, including Barun Saha, Dipak Samanta, Rintu Roy and Tarun Banerjee, who will be working on diverse themes. The plan is to paint around 500 walls across the city in the next five years.
 
 To begin with, 20 locations have been identified for the artists to pain on the walls, including, Exide Crossing, Ballygunge Tram Depot and  . The walls of three Metro stations, yet to be finalised, will also be painted. 
 
 Chowdhury said that the city already has a tradition of street art. “I congratulate this initiative. Only a handful people may get to see paintings during a exhibition but with this, lakhs will get to admire art. We, however, have to be a little careful as the purpose of an art work would get lost if a hoarding board blocks the space,” he said.
 
 Kolkata Municipal Corporation MMiC (Parks and Gardens) Debashish Kumar said the festival will make the city beautiful. “Its a great opportunity for artists to reach the masses,” he said.
 
 Fashion designer Agnimitra Paul also lauded the initiative. She proposed that one wall should be left for the common people to paint.
 
 Abhijit Roy, CEO and MD of Berger Paints, that is introduced the festival said, the main objective behind the festival is to make the city cleaner and beautiful.
