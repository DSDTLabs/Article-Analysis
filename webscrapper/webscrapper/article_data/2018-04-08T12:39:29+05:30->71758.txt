Dupur Thakurpo, an adult comedy web series, which had Swastika Mukherjee playing  , grabbed eyeballs for obvious reasons. For the much-awaited Season 2, Sreelekha Mitra was supposed to replace Swastika and play Jhuma boudi, after the latter bowed out of the series. And now, there’s a new twist in the afternoon saga.   aka  , who has many   films to her credit and was part of Bigg Boss 10, is on board for the part. Dupur Thakurpo’s title track is a remake of a popular Bhojpuri song and Season 2 was expected to star Swastika as a Bhojpuri performer, apart from Uma boudi. With so much Bhojpuri connect, Monalisa could be an obvious choice. 
Season II starts with a situation where the parents of all the thakurpos (brothers-in-law) are admitted in a rehab after Jibon Babu complained to them about their sons, who were disturbing his relationship with Uma Boudi. “I am super-excited to play Jhuma boudi. Two-three months back I saw the series that had Swastika in it and my friends said how popular   was. I heard the song too and when I got a call to play this character, I was on cloud nine,” said Monalisa.
