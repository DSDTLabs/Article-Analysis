CHENNAI: Airports Authority of India (AAI) has expedited work on building a travellator tube that will connect domestic and international terminals with the   station at the  . The tube that will run parallel to the terminal will be linked to another steel and glass tube before the metro station. AAI is planning to complete the work by March or April. 

 So far, work on the steel and glass tube from domestic teminal building to the international arrival building has been completed. Work is now on to build it further up to the   building. An escalator is also being installed near international and domestic arrivals for passengers who come out of the terminals on the ground floor so they can have easy access to the travellator. 
 
 The   which will have a   inside for people to move will help in hassle-free access from the metro rail station to the airport and vice versa. People who arrive by metro trains need not get out of the station but can go one level lower and walk through a tube, which is already completed, to reach the travelator tube. 
 
 A senior official of AAI said, “The work can be completed fast as it is made of pre-fabricated materials. The tube has been installed at quite a length under the flyover that runs in front of the terminals. The rest will be completed in the coming months. The travelator will be installed after the tube is ready.”
 
 Now, AAI has introduced battery operated cars to pick up and drop passengers at the metro rail station. As the tube connecting metro station and the terminal is perpendicular, a staircase has been built for people who come out of arrival terminals of the airport to reach the metro rail station.
 
 Several air passengers have started to use the metro trains after services were extended to Nehru Park via Koyambedu and Anna Nagar. More than 30,000 commuters use metro trains daily.
