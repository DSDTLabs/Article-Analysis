CHANDIGARH: A day after its finance and contract committee (F&CC) decided against hiking charges at parking lots, the municipal corporation (MC) on Wednesday issued a notice to the firm which is managing the lots and asked it to pay an outstanding amount of Rs 4.7 crore within a week.

 Municipal commissioner   has also formed a committee led by superintending engineer (SE)   to check all paid parking lots of the city and report whether the agency has turned all paid parking lots into “smart parking lots”. According to the agreement between the firm and the civic body, the company had introduce several new concepts at parking lots of the city to make them “smart”.
 
 With this move, the MC’s plan to double parking charges has come to a halt. The MC has been saying that the firm had not been depositing the money in the stipulated time and there were anomalies in the parking lots too. “We have now asked the company to deposit all outstanding dues within a week. If it fails to do so, action will be taken according tothe rules. Asfacilities at parking lots are another crucial point, a team of the MC will inspect all lots and submit a report,” said  , joint municipal commissioner, who is heading the parking branch of the MC.
 
 During the F&CC’s meeting on Tuesday, the MC had said the firm had breached the contract by not clearing outstanding dues and not developing parking lots into smart ones. Mayor   on Tuesday had said parking rates would not be increased till the firm complied with all conditions mentioned in the contract.
 
 Overcrowding and haphazard parking lots are common at almost every parking lot in the city. Residents have complained of overcharging and misbehaviour by parking staff. The members of F&CC on Tuesday also decided that an undertaking should be taken from the firm that overcharging will not be done in future.
