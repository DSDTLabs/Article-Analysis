KARWAR: Madhav Nayak, social activist and president of Janashakhti Vedike, lodged a complaint with Karwar Town police against a Goan woman, Anjela Fernandes, a resident of Agunda village, for allegedly creating disharmony among the people of the two states. Anjela allegedly made some derogatory remarks against the people of Karwar, in connection with the death of six Goan picnickers at   in Karwar last Sunday. Though the picnickers had drowned downstream of the falls due to flash floods, Anjela had, on her Facebook wall, posted that they were deliberately killed by the people of Karwar who released water from the dam as they dislike Goa. She also alleged that the picnickers were killed because the place was used for the immersion of idols of Lord Ganesha during Ganesh Chaturthi, and is spoiled by tourists. To avoid tourists visiting the falls, dam water was released and the Goans killed, Anjela alleged.

 In his complaint, Madhav Nayak stated that she was spreading false and mischievous news through social media against the people of Karwar which would lead to disharmony and hatred between them and Goans.
 
 He added that there is no dam built across the stream, which turns into a waterfall at Nagaramadi.
 
 As the falls are in the forest, no Ganesha idol is immersed in the Nagaramadi falls. Though many had objected to her post on FB, she snubbed all of them and defended her post, Nayak said. Such an act leads to disharmony, enmity, feelings of hatred and ill-will between different religious groups, and she should be brought to justice, he said.
 
 Karwar police registered a case and are carrying out an investigation.
