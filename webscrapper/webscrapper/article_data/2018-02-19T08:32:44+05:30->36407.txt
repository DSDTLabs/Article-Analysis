KOCHI: With Middle Eastern budget carriers operating connection flights to Eastern European destinations, tour operators in Kochi have been witnessing a significant spike in the number of   visiting Eastern European destinations for holidays. 

 "East European destinations have become popular among Malayalis after budget carriers have added those cities to their schedule over the past three years. Last year, there were bookings for cities like   and Baku," said Mark C Marcus, director, Ornate Travels. 
 
 A senior official with a leading Middle Eastern budget carrier said the number of Malayalis traveling to East European destinations such as Azerbaijan, Armenia, and   has increased by more than 50% in 2017 alone. 
 
 "The top destination for traveling Malayalis were Far Eastern destinations such Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. But now most them want to explore more and they have the option to do," said Biji Eapen, national president of IATA Agents Association of India.
 
 Middle Eastern budget carriers like Air Arabia and Fly Dubai, fly passengers from Kochi to Eastern European destinations, with a stopover in the UAE. 
 
 "They have filled an important void in the market. Tickets to the Far East would cost around Rs 40,000 while tickets to popular European cities like Paris, Rome or London, would cost more than a lakh. Tickets to Eastern European destinations can cost something in between that price range," said an industry insider. 
 
 "These destinations offer thrills and excitement to adventure seekers as well as history buffs," said Mark.
 
 Furthermore, airline officials suggest that Malayalis also pay an extra bit more and opt for layover in Dubai or Sharjah.
 
 "For many Malayalis, UAE is not a just a shopping destination. They have family and friends there. So, many of them spend a bit more to get a tourist visa and spend some time with them before they conclude their vacation," he added.
