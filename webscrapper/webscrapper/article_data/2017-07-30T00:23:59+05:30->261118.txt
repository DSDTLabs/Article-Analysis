Trichy: Though   remains to be the major reason for  , malnutrition among mothers during pregnancy is also contributing to hearing loss among children in the district. A special camp by the Trichy district administration to identify children for   surgery received six children – four from Thuraiyur Taluk and two from Trichy city - of which four were either born pre-term or low birth weight babies while two were born to the parents of consanguineous marriage. 

 “Consanguineous marriage is the common cause for cochlear hearing loss in children. There are some other reasons such as pre-term delivery, low birth weight and birth asphyxia for this congenital disability,” said Dr S Palaniappan, head of ENT department at the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital .
 
 Another matter of concern was malnutrition among pregnant mothers which leads to the pre-term babies. “Women should have nutritious food to keep them healthy to deliver a healthy baby. With the help of facilities in the government has set up we can save the mother and the baby, but malnutrition in mother causes such problems,” said Dr Palaniappan. 
 
 At the camp, doctors screened six children and accepted five children for treatment. The doctor rejected an eight year old child because the treatment would only be effective for children until 6 years of age. They will undergo a slew of tests before the cochlear implant surgery at free of cost under the chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme. 
 
 Rolled out in November 2016, the surgery has so far covered 36 children in the age group of 1 to 6 years. The scheme provides Rs 7.5 lakh for each surgery. Several of them were able to hear and speak after going through auditory rehabilitation. 
 
 “Despite creating awareness among people to get treatment free of cost, many still consider the disability as a curse of god and refuse to take their children for treatment,” said Dr Palaniappan.
