TIRUPUR: Compounded effects of demonetisation, Goods and   (GST) and reduction of duty drawback have affected labourers of knitwear industry, said   All Garment Trade Unions, a federation of six trade unions comprising AITUC, CITU, LPF, MLF, INTUC and HMS.

 It also petitioned the Union finance minister Arun Jaitley in this regard. N Sekar, general secretary, Banian Factories Labour Union, Tirupur AITUC, submitted the petition to the minister in New Delhi on Wednesday in the presence of three   MPs.
 
 “In Tirupur, knitwear production has come down by 50% due to the twin financial changes brought in by the Union government. We did not say it from the garment manufacturers’ side but from that of the labourers because it has directly affected their lives as many lost jobs or not able to land jobs daily,” said G Sampath, general secretary, CITU, Tirupur district.
 
 So, the Centre should exempt companies involved in knitting to packing from the GST ambit and also increase duty drawback to overcome the crisis and help the labourers get their employment back, the petition said.
 
 Among the nine lakh labourers associated with the district’s 70-year-old industry, which registered a turnover of Rs 40,000 crore last year, more than 70% of labourers are either from other districts or other states. The labourers spend one-third of earnings on house rentals. “Taking all these factors into account, the union government should allocate special financial package to benefit the labourers, especially for building apartment houses for them,” the petition said.
 
 The trade unions also urged the Centre to realise the long-pending proposal to construct 100-bedded ESI multispecialty hospital in Tirupur and also set up Knitwear Garment Development Board.
