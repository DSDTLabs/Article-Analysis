MADURAI: Tension prevailed at Kalavasal in the city on Friday as people caught hold of a man in his thirties with a newborn baby girl mistaking him for a kidnapper. The drama which prevailed for some time ended only after the police intervened.

 Investigations revealed that the man was a relative of the two-month-old child. He seemed to behave in a mentally unsound manner catching the attention of the people. Many even tried to attack him as they thought that he was feigning mental illness after being caught red-handed. Police enquiries revealed that the infant’s parents, M Arumugam and Raji, were from   in   district. They were touring Madurai and were on their way to   on a TNSTC bus from Pollachi, where they visited a temple. Since the parents had to grapple with the luggage they were carrying and already had a child with them while travelling , they had handed over the newborn to Raji’s elder brother Hari. 
 
 On the way, Hari got down from the bus at Kalavasal since he thought he had reached the destination as many had disembarked at the junction. Arumugam and Raji were shocked to learn on reaching Arappalayam that Hari and the baby were not on the bus. Meanwhile at Kalavasal, the public caught Hari and started questioning him. Even as Hari tried to explain his position, there were no takers for it as they mistook him for a kidnapper. This was because there has been at least three incidents of child lifting from Madurai government   hospital. 
 
 Meanwhile, a video shot by the onlookers began circulating on WhatsApp as well. Soon, a police team rushed to the spot and questioned Hari. He was taken to Arappalayam bus terminal where they found the anxious parents looking out for him and the baby. The SS Colony police asked the couple to take good care of the two before returning.
