Jalandhar: While Union minister of state for foreign affairs Gen V K Singh (retd) said the Indians killed in Mosul were illegal immigrants, inquiries from some families of the victims revealed that they had gone to Iraq on valid visas. However, they said these could be short duration visas.

 Ravinder Singh Lucky of Hoshiarpur, who worked in the same company with the victims and had returned in July 2013 when his visa was about to expire, said he had gone there on two year work permit in 2011. “My entry there was recorded in the immigration records and as I talked to other co-workers, they told me that they too had reached there on work permits,” he said while speaking to TOI on Wednesday. “Details must be known to the their travel agents, but it was common knowledge that people were going there on valid work visas,” he said.
 
 Family of Roop Lal from Bathaan village also claimed that he went to Iraq in 2011 on valid visa. “It is clear that he had a valid visa for Iraq even though I am not clear about its duration,” said his brother-in-law Ravinder. Relatives of Devinder Singh of Chak Des Raj village said, “Before leaving, he told us that he had got work permit visa for Iraq. He had gone in 2012 and told us that it was for two years,” said his brother-in-law Baldev Singh.
 
 “My brother Nand Lal from Talwan village was already working there in Iraq and he arranged visa for my elder son Sandeep also,” said Sumitra of Allewali village. “To us, it is clear that his visa was for Iraq till 2013. He had even called us to inform that the a major project was about to start and he would get his younger brother Kuldeep also there,” she said. Both Nand Lal and Sandeep were among the victims.
