HYDERABAD: The   (BJP) has called chief minister  's vow to implement 12 per cent reservations for Muslims a declaration of his lack of respect for the Constitution of India and judgements of various courts that ruled against such reservations.

 Reacting to Rao's promise in the   on Wednesday regarding the government's commitment to provide 12 per cent reservations to Muslims, Telangana BJP president   said the chief minister was trying to fool Muslims into believing that something like this is possible. “He is trying to cheat Muslims in the state by promising the impossible.There are previous judgments from courts that shot down similar proposals. This is nothing but a move to garner votes from the minority community for the TRS,“ Laxman said in a statement.
 
 “It is surprising that Chandrashekar Rao is following this path despite the recent clear verdict in   that the days of pandering to castes and communities is over,“ Laxman said.
 
 He also said that any dilution of reservations by increasing percentages for other communities is unconstitutional and will not stand judicial scrutiny. Such a move will dilute the TRS government's promised welfare to the Backward Classes in Telangana.
