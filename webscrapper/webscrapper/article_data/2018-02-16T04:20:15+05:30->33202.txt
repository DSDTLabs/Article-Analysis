NAVI MUMBAI: The death of 460 parrots in a   at Tumsar in   district has left animal rights activists worried about   and deforestation playing havoc with the environment. “Climate and, thus, weather change appear to be the primary reasons for this unfortunate incident,” Dr Manilal Valliyate, CEO, PETA India, said. 

 Valliyate said that while the hailstones might have caused the birds physical harm, the climatic conditions might have affected the overall immunity of the birds or sent them into a state of shock.
 
 Range forest officer (RFO) Arvind Joshi, who is based in Tumsar, said that on Tuesday night hailstones as big as lemons rained down and the parrots took shelter in an old peepal tree next to a Shiv temple. “By morning, the locals discovered over 460 dead parrots under the tree; it was a sad, heart-rending sight,” Joshi said.
 
 He said that barely six parrots survived the night, and the disoriented birds were taken to a local dispensary. “Many cars were dented in the strong hailstorm. One can only imagine what the poor parrots went through,” Joshi said.
 
 Valliyate, who is a veterinarian, said the UN believes that a global shift towards plant-based food is vital if we are to combat the worst effects of climate change. “A report published by the Worldwatch Institute shows that a staggering 51% or more of global greenhouse gas emission is caused by the raising and processing of animals used for meat, eggs and a dairy,” he said.
 
 A Navi Mumbai activist, Anarjit Chauhan, said destruction of trees and deforestation can cause freaks of weather like hailstorms.
