LUCKNOW:   Yogi Adityanath has inherited a brimming treasury from his predecessor  . Finance department sources said the Samajwadi Party government could only spend about 46% of the cumulative funds allotted to departments during 2016-17. A whopping 54% funds, as a result, remain unspent and ready for use by the new BJP government.

 In February 2016, former CM Akhilesh Yadav had tabled his last full annual budget of Rs 3,46,935 crore for 2016-17. In August 2016, Akhilesh also tabled a supplementary budget of Rs 25,347.87 crore for the 2016-17 fiscal. 
 
 On March 31, 2017, the last working day of the previous fiscal, while the Public Works Department (PWD), irrigation, were among the departments recording the highest utilisation of funds, large departments like urban development, transport, health and agriculture utilised less than 50% of the funds allocated to them in 2016-17.
 
 Government insiders attributed the sub-par performance to two reasons: first, the Samajwadi Party family feud that kept government functioning in a limbo in the last quarter of 2016, second, the poll code of conduct that was enforced with effect from January 2017. Officials said the last six months, therefore, were spent only executing some key projects identified as flagship programmes of the government, even as the remaining took a back-seat. 
 
 SP minister Shivpal Singh Yadav’s PWD had made the largest demand for grants—nearly Rs 4,547 crore—about 18% of the supplementary budget in 2016-17. Against the demand, fund utilisation of PWD grants is above 80%. Other top performers include the departments of estate, higher education, science and technology and food and civil supplies, which had raised a demand for Rs 1,500 crore in the supplementary budget. 
 
 The primary education and social welfare (SC special component plan) departments, which raised a demand for grants worth Rs 3,600 crore and Rs 1,200 crore respectively, however, were among the laggards. While the primary department only utilised 2.91% funds allocated to it, the social welfare department used 41.69% funds. Similarly, while the SP government sought Rs 2,000 crore for relief and rehabilitation work in the supplementary budget, it could only spend 2.09% through the department of relief and rehabilitation. 
 
 The sugarcane development department could also only spend 4.08% of its total allocation in 2016-17, while the Muslim Waqf department spent 31.22%, heavy industries 10.61% and environment department 31.38% of the funds allocated to it during the previous fiscal.
