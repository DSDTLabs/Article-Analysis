Surat: ‘We Work For A Working Airport At Surat’ (WWWAS) has blamed the callous attitude of officials of Airports Authority of India (AAI) for the inordinate delay in getting the approval for operation of second phase of runway strengthening and granting of customs and immigration status for Surat airport. 

 Last week, directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA), replying to an RTI query of WWWAS, stated that AAI is yet to submit documents related to the approval for operation of second phase of runway, the work for which was completed last month. 
 
 In the latest RTI reply to WWWAS, AAI has stated that there were no formalities pending at its end, which may be delaying the work for granting of customs and immigration status to Surat airport. 
 
 Sources said AAI had executed the work for extension and strengthening of the runway at Surat airport in two phases. AAI had submitted documents requesting commissioning approval for phase one work of the runway extension in April 2017 and that the same was granted on April 20, 2017. However, the AAI is yet to submit documents for commissioning of phase two of the project for strengthening of the runway for approval.
 
 At present, the airlines are operating the flights on load penalty as they are unable to use the full-length runway of 2,905 metre. Against the aircraft capacity of 185 passengers, the airlines have to accommodate only 140 passengers due to load penalty. 
 
 The expansion of 2,905 metre of runway and the 185 metre strengthening work was supposed to be completed by March 2017. However, the work was delayed for almost six months due to less workforce and slow decision making of the authorities. 
 
 For limited international operations, the airport needs 2,905 metre runway, which has been reduced to close to 1,900 metre due to pending approval from the DGCA.
