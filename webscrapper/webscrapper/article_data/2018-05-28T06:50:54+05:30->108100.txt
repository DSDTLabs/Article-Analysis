CHENNAI: Police and corporation officials on Sunday evicted 315 families who were granted time by the Madras high court till June 10 to vacate their homes on Konnur High Road,  . Residents of the slum that had been there for around 50 years have been relocated to houses built by Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) in  . 

 
 A police official said the people agreed to move and no force was used. "They agreed to move earlier than June 10 to be able to admit their children in schools." Corporation officials deployed excavators to remove the vacated huts to desilt a nearby arch drain.
 
 Pennurimai Iyakkam, an NGO, had gone to court against TNSCB and the department of housing and urban development appealing that the slum dwellers be rehabilitated at the present location itself. In the public interest litigation,   said mass eviction and relocation to distant places would create a ghetto culture and force children to drop out of schools.
 
 In March, the high court directed the 315 families in Otteri to vacate their homes on or before June 10. Pennurimai Iyakkam advisor   said, "Officials evicted the residents in a hurry as they got wind of our plans to make an appeal in the   for in-situ rehabilitation of slum dwellers."
 
 Evicted residents said they were denied the promised government aid of 5,000 for relocation and the monthly aid of 2,500 for a year as mandated by The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. 
 
 An Otteri resident for 60 years, K Karthiga said, "My nine-year child goes to a matriculation school here. Schools in Perumbakkam are understaffed and poorly run. We have been relocated against our will."
