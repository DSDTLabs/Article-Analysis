SHIMLA: Chief minister Jai Ram   said on Thursday that PM Narendra Modi has wished that concept of changing government after every five years should end in Himachal. He said that commitment of the government was to serve the people of state for next 20 years and to make   a model state of the country.

 While addressing a public meeting at Ani in Kullu district on Wednesday late evening, Thakur said that every district and every nook and corner of state would receive its share of development. “I am the chief minister of entire state and not of a particular region,” he said.
 
 At the same time, while referring to his elevation as the CM, he said this time it was the turn of Mandi district after Shimla, Kangra, and Hamirpur. The people of Mandi waited long for a CM from the district, he added.
 
 The CM said that Mandi district gave a clear mandate to BJP and the Congress could not even open its account. Maheshwar Singh’s defeat in elections was a personal loss to the party, he added.
 
 Thakur said that he knows about poverty as he has seen poverty closely. “I have gone through the tough times and understand well the pain of a common man,” he added.
