SURAT: Family members of a 22-year-old man, who died under mysterious circumstances, refused to accept his body after post-mortem formalities were completed at New Civil Hospital (NCH), demanding a murder complaint be registered first and investigation ordered into his death. 

 The murder complaint was registered on Tuesday evening by police after the family members made a representation to city police commissioner Satish Sharma. 
 
 The man had died around 11.30 pm on Monday and the post-mortem was carried out on the next day. Family members alleged that he was murdered but the police initially disagreed with them. 
 
 Rinkesh Patel, a resident of Bhandut village, fell unconscious while being brought home from Adajan after he was allegedly kidnapped and thrashed by some people. He was shifted to the hospital by his friends where he was declared dead. 
 
 A complaint of accidental death was registered at Olpad police station. Rinkesh had received a message from a girl on WhatsApp on Monday evening who asked him to meet her near Parshuram Garden. Rinkesh went there with his friend Jay and was kidnapped in a car. Jay had managed to escape.
 
 “My son was kidnapped and thrashed. When he was being brought home by his friends, he died. We will not accept his body till a murder complaint is registered and police conduct a thorough investigation in the case,” Subhash, father of the deceased, had earlier told TOI. 
 
 On Tuesday evening, the family member told TOI that they will accept the body only after receiving a copy of the FIR.
 
 “Initially, it was not clear if it was a murder, but rural police already had registered a case of accidental death. When the issue was brought to my knowledge, I ordered Adajan police to register an offence. City police had no information initially that the man was being threatened by someone in Adajan,” city police commissioner Satish Sharma said.
