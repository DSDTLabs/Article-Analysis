NAGPUR: Nagpur University’s Examination Section came under scanner following a series of goof ups in the rescheduling its 130 examinations, which was to be held on Saturday, but was deferred due to clashing of dates with the 105th convocation ceremony.

 Earlier, it had declared that all 131 examinations would be conducted on April 8. However, its officials wake from slumber only after colleges designated as exam centres informed them that the CBSE had taken over their premises for conducting Mains paper of Joint Entrance Examination (JEE for admission to IITs and NITs) on same date. Even   commission (MPSC) would be conducting one of its exams on same date at some NU centres.
 
 Pro-VC  , heading the   confirmed that NU would be postponing the April 8 exams, as many of its centres were taken over by the CBSE, particularly in Nagpur. “The new timetable would be declared soon, but only after verifying dates of various entrance examinations or those conducted by the UPSC/MPSC. We don’t want to take any chances now,” he told TOI.
 
 Earlier, Exam Section officials goofed up with the figures and declared that 118 exams, supposed to be conducted on March 24, would be rescheduled. Later, they realized that they forgot to add 13 more subjects and then released an additional list. NU sources said more papers would be added, once its officials properly tally all papers.
 
 NU’s second phase of examinations was supposed to begin from March 24. It included important subjects like first, third and fifth semesters of BA, BCom and BSc. Its first phase commenced from March 1 where certificate and diploma courses papers were held. NU had advanced its entire summer exam schedule by a week and had planned to complete it in four phases, against seven till last year. The move was taken for early declaration of results to pave way for completing admissions process in June-July. However, the recent controversy hit it hard and threw its entire schedule to haywire, sources said.
