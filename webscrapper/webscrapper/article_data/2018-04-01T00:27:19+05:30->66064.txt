Jaipur: Education minister Vasudev Devnani has promised to take strict action against schools, which flouted the Rajasthan Private School Fees Act to hike their annual fees.

 Talking to TOI on Saturday, the minister requested parents, who were unhappy about the fee hike, to send a complaint to the district collector’s office.
 
 “The department has not received any complaint against the unjust fee hike. I request parents to come forward and submit complaints so that the department can act,” said Devnani. He assured parents that action would be taken against the errant schools as per the Act.
 
 The Act says that in case of a dispute between parents and other members (teachers and school administrators) over the quantum of fees, an appeal can be made first to the divisional commissioner. “If either party is not happy with the outcome of the first appeal, the matter will be directed to the education department secretary for a second appeal,” according to the Act.
 
 It is surprising that despite the provision for challenging the proposed fee by schools, the appellate authorities have received very few applications.
 
 However, Dr Kumar Ashutosh, whose two sons are studying at BVB Vidhyashram which hiked the annual fee allegedly by 27%, claimed that he received no response after complaining to the education department about the hike. The Act empowers the divisional-level fee committee to search, inspect, seize any records, accounts and registers of errant schools. Devnani claimed that out of 33,000 private schools in the state, 24,000 have decided on the fees and uploaded the same on portals.
