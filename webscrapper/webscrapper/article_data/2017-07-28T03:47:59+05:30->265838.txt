NEW DELHI:   vice-president   accused JD(U) chief   of unprincipled politics based on lust for power, saying he had an inkling of his plans to jump the “grand alliance” ship.

 Rahul told reporters, “He (Nitish) had joined hands with us in the anti-communal fight, but Nitish Kumar, for his personal politics, joined hands with those against whom he had fought.”
 
 Venting his anger, Rahul dubbed Nitish’s partnerhopping was a malaise afflicting Indian politics. “In politics, you come to know of what is going on in the minds of people. Clearly, I knew Nitish is planning. We knew this was going on for the last three-four months.”
 
 He said, “People do anything for their selfish motives. There is no principle, no credibility. They can do anything for power.”
 
 As Kumar took oath as CM in partnership with former arch rival BJP, a rattled Congress called it a “black day” for democracy, lamenting that Kumar had vowed never to join hands with   and was trusted on his word.
 
  spokesman   asked Kumar to clarify where he stands on Vice-President’s election and if he would still vote for  , saying that since announcing JD(U)’s support, he had shifted allegiance to “communal” BJP.
 
 “In Bihar, every political and democratic principle was murdered in broad daylight and a government of BJP-JD (U) has been formed today, which is neither people’s mandate nor does it have the authority to rule. This is a black day indeed for Indian democracy,” AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala said.
