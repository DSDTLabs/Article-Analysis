MADURAI: With the much-awaited meeting between   and   on Thursday failing to make a breakthrough in getting the ban on jallikattu lifted, protesters in Madurai have escalated their agitation. Showing no signs of backing off, they resolved to continue the protest till the bulls are released through the ' ' in Alanganallur.

 The protesting youths felt that the Centre continued to ignore  . They also lashed out at the state government for the "snail's pace" with which it was dealing with the protest. A few of the protesting youths climbed atop cell phone towers to express their feelings. Two such incidents were reported, one within city limits and the other in the rural police limits. The protests spread to every nook and cranny of the city on Thursday as youths launched demonstrations at many parts which had not seen them in the last two days. Apart from road blocks, bike rallies were also taken up by the youths while residents organised a human chain at Sundaram Park.
 
 Dinesh Karthick, a youth from Paravai who has been protesting at Alanganallur, said "We are not disheartened by the outcome of the CM's meeting with PM. It has given a fillip to our inner urge to march towards victory, which will see the bulls running out of the vadivaasal majestically. We will continue our peaceful protest until the aim is achieved," he said.
 
 Abdul Hakkim, an engineering student from Dindigul camping at Alanganallur, said "Initially there were objections from my parents in taking part in the protest as I informed them about my whereabouts only after reaching here. Now, they have started supporting me and the protest. As the days pass by, the number of participants and their enthusiasm are only growing."
 
 Both the city as well as rural police had a tough time controlling the crowd.
