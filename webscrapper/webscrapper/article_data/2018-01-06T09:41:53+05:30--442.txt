Mumbai: The   hit a 32-month high of 63.37 on Friday, up four paise from its previous close on the back of a weaker dollar. The   has been weakening against other currencies as there has been uncertainty over rate hikes in the US.

 According to dealers, the rupee gained on selling by exporters over fears that the currency would appreciate further. The last time the rupee was at current levels was in April 2015 when the local currency traded at 63.30. The rupee has strengthened by 55 paise since the start of 2018.
 
 The rupee was also bolstered by the strong run in the equity markets which has been supported by   ( ) in recent days. “FPI investments in the current fiscal have been driven by the debt segment which received a net inflow of Rs. 1.17 lakh crore during the first eight months of 8M FY2018 with positive net inflows across all months. The equity segment, however, witnessed a net outflow of FPI investment during the August and September amidst concerns on earnings growth, rising valuations and slowing GDP growth.” Karthik Srinivasan, sr VP,  .
 
 Globally, the greenback remained higher against other major currencies ahead of the highly-anticipated US jobs data due later in the day. In cross-currency trades, the rupee firmed up further against the pound sterling to end at 85.81 per pound from 85.89 and the Japanese yen rose sharply to finish at 55.96 per 100 yens from 56.31 earlier.
 
 According to Bloomberg, the bearish dollar trade hinges on the idea that global growth will pick up this year, prompting central banks to follow the Fed in paring stimulus and raising rates. This in turn may boost the appeal of other currencies against the greenback. The median forecast in a   survey has the euro strengthening to $1.25 in 2019, from $1.2070 now. The euro hovered near a three-year high against the sagging dollar yesterday, as data showed the euro zone economy closed out 2017 with the strongest growth in nearly seven years.
