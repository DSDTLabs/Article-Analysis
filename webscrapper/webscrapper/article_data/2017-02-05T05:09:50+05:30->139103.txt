FEROZEPUR/LUDHIANA: Contributing her bit to strengthen democracy in  , 108-year-old Basanti Devi cast her vote with the help of her grandson in   on Saturday.

 Unable to move on her own, Basanti was carried to the booth by her grandson Suraj Prakash. She was very happy about casting her vote for the 37th time, she said.
 
 Suraj claimed his granny had been insisting on exercising her franchise since morning but the family was hesitant as it was very cold. “As the weather improved in the afternoon, I brought her here with my wife’s help,” he added. “Though she has a hearing problem and other oldage related complications, she is well versed with the entire polling process,” Suraj said.
 
 Another such voter was 106-year-old Mala Devi, who too voted in Ludhiana. She was provided with a pick-and-drop facility by the administration, Ludhiana deputy commissioner Ravi Bhagat said. Poll volunteers went to her residence and brought her, along with some family members, to the polling station and dropped her home after she cast her vote, he said. She was taken to the booth in a wheelchair and presented a rose later.
