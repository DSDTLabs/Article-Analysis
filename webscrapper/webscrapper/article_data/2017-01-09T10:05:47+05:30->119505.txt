Madhya Pradesh was second, with 55 cases, with West Bengal being third with 50 cases, shows the data. Together, the six states, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra acoounted for 57% of the total ragging cases in the country in 2016, according to the helpline data. 
 
 North-eastern states Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Manipur are the only ones from where no cases of ragging were reported at all. Of the seven union territories, only Delhi has reported some cases. “Achhe din for freshers in colleges, especially engineering, and medical have yet to dawn as a high number of ragging cases bring to light the menace that often leads students to suicide on campuses,’’ said ragging activist Gaurav Singhal. 
 
 TOI also accessed the overall complaint status as recorded by the Anti-Ragging Helpline from April 17, 2012 to January 7, 2016. The total complaints received during this period were 2,439 of which 2,301 have been disposed of. A total of 42 complaint cells are active in the call centre while six are active in the monitoring agency (Aman Satya Kachroo Trust). The number of complaints active in the UGC is 62. A total of 28 complaints are active in various regulatory authorities. Till January 7, 30,35,522 students (seniors and freshers) have submitted an affidavit, available on the Central government’s anti-ragging web portal. 
 
 Besides the high number of ragging cases reported to the helpline, there are thousands of other cases that are reported directly to the college head, or the police, without any involvement of the helpline, activists said. “So, the actual number of ragging cases in India are far more than reported by the helpline. It should also keep a record of cases where an FIR was lodged with the police by the college,’’ said Singhal. 
 
 HELP’S AT HAND
 
 UGC set up a 24-hour helpline in 2006 under the directions of Supreme Court. Every complaint is followed till justice is secured.   queries have revealed that only 1% of the actual number of cases get registered with the helpline because students are too scared to complain, fearing a backlash.
