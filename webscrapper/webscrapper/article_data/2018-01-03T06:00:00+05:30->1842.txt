It’s a Boy!!!!!!!!”, wrote   on his social media page on Monday morning announcing the news of him becoming a ‘proud father’ again. A couple of days back the actor posted a note on his social media account stating: “Most of them are saying that I should be blessed with a baby boy to get an heir. I already have two heirs, Ariaana & Viviana. So the next one (Boy or Girl), will be the third heir. It doesn’t need to be only a boy to take the family legacy forward (sic)”. Needless to say, the news has brought immense cheer to the entire   family and both Vishnu and wife   are rejoicing at the new addition to their family.

 However, for a while now, fake pictures of the new born baby have been doing the rounds. To which, the actor appealed, “I request everyone to respect the privacy of our family. All our well-wishers, please do not spread fake pictures of our baby. What you see going viral are not real pictures, I’ll soon share the picture of the baby with all.” Looks like a great start to the year for Vishnu, who has films like Gayatri, Voter and   up for release.
