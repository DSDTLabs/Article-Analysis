NEW DELHI: The 
  to   Parliamentarian   for his 
  in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.

 While offensive in and of themselves, the BJP leader's comments were also in violation of the EC's Model Code of Conduct. The EC has ordered Maharaj to reply by January 11.
 
 On January 6 and 7 Maharaj said - without naming Muslims - that any community that is "allowed to marry four times and have 40 children is responsible for the country's 
  ".
 
 "...a woman is not a machine. Four wives, 40 children, three divorces, all this is not acceptable," Maharaj said on January 7, a day after his first set of inflammatory comments at a meeting of Hindu religious leaders in  , Uttar Pradesh.
 
 The EC's model code of conduct forbids such talk.
 
 "No party or candidate shall include in any activity which may aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred or cause tension between different castes and communities, religious or linguistic... There shall be no appeal to caste or communal feelings for securing votes. Mosques, Churches, Temples or other places of worship shall not be used as forum for election propaganda," the EC says describing what's proscribed as per the Model Code of Conduct.
