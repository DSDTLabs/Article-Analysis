MUMBAI: For yet another year, confusion reigns over   admissions in the city as the education department has not issued instructions on its plan to move the process online.

 Most junior colleges are asking students to wait for a few weeks before they start the admission process.
 
 Last year, the state government had planned to conduct   to the second year of junior college ( ) through a centralized online process. Every year, thousands of students switch their college after Class XI as they are unhappy with the option allotted to them in the first year junior college ( ) admission process. There were reports suggesting such admissions were not on merit- basis of merit.
 
 Overburdened with the Class XI admission, the education department put off the plan to move the Class XII admission online. Education department officials said they might not implement the plan this year too. 
 
 “The agency handling the online process for Class IX admissions is already working to incorporate the changes this year. Amidst this, there is yet no decision on what has to be done for the class XII admissions. While it is unlikely that the online process for class XII will be developed in time, we will have more clarity in the second week of May,” an official said.
 
 Junior colleges have begun receiving queries from Class XI pass-outs. 
 
 “We have asked the students to come in the month of May or June since we do not know the education department’s plan for the admission process. Last year too, we had to do the same thing until we received instructions that the plan has been put off,” a junior college principal said.
 
 According to the education department’s estimates about 35% of the students changed college after class XI. The department from last year began asking students to provide a reason for changing their college.
