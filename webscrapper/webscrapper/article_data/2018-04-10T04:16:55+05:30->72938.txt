BEIJING: China said on Monday that it would leave it to the local administration in Hong Kong to take a decision on India’s request for repatriation of  . Modi is suspected to be hiding in Hong Kong. 

 Though part of China, the Hong Kong Special Autonomous Region (HKSAR) is run by a local government elected through a democratic election under what Beijing calls the “one country, two systems” policy. 
 
 Speaking to reporters, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said, “According to the one country, two systems (policy) and basic law of the HKSAR, under the assistance and authorisation of the Central government, the HKSAR can make arrangements on judicial mutual assistance with other countries”. He encouraged India to deal with Hong Kong on the matter. “If India makes a relevant request to the HKSAR, we believe the HKSAR will follow the basic law and relevant laws, and under relevant judicial agreements with India, on relevant issue,” he said. 
 
 China may be open to the idea of deporting Modi to India. It has been desperately trying to bring back Chinese citizens suspected of economic offenses and hiding in developed countries. At the same time, China might hold Modi back and use him as a bargaining chip to get concessions for itself in negotiations with India, observers think.
