Salem: As the city gears up to celebrate Pongal, the Salem Municipal Corporation (SMC) on Thursday unveiled the plans to set up as many as 25 collection points in each of its four zones where residents can discard old things on the day of Bhogi, the first day of the four-day harvest festival.

 “On the day of Bhogi, which this year falls on Saturday, the residents usually discard old things and set them on fire at night, polluting both the environment and the air. So, we have launched Bhogi Bucket Challenge to celebrate a pollution-free Bhogi in the city,” SMC commissioner R Sadheesh said.
 
 The Bhogi Bucket Challenge, he said, was launched to collect old and discarded materials. “In all the four zones of Ammapet, Suramangalam, Hasthampatty and Kondalampatty we have set up 25 collections points each. They will function from Wednesday until January 20. The residents can drop old materials such as pillows, mats, beds, clothes and plastic items there. We will take them to dump yard,” the SMC commissioner added.
