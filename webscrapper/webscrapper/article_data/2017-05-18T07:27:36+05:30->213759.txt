IDUKKI: The police are still in the dark about the   murder case even after three months. Till now, they haven't any   about the accused. 

  On February 14, Rajaguru (42), a pre-school ayah, was found murdered inside the creche of the Gundumala estates of   at   division near Munnar. The police had deputed a special team to inquire the case and questioned around 400 people, including close relatives. The weapon used for the murder and the gold chains of over 12 sovereigns she was wearing are also yet to be recovered.
 
  Earlier, the police had thought that a close relative is the main accused in the case. But the juvenile continuously changed his statement and the police couldn't recover the murder weapon or the gold ornaments.
 
  Two weeks ago, Munnar   asked to Rajaguru's husband and younger son to attend a lie detection test. But they refused to do so.
