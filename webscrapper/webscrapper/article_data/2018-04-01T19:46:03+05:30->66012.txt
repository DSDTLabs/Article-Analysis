Off to a promising beginning, the   all-rounder and Bengaluru boy   had to face a slump for four years in his early 20s, when he didn’t get to play competitive cricket. Choosing not to be beaten down, the 29-year-old right-hand bat, right-arm offbreak has been letting his performance do all the talking over the last two years, showing why the state team needs him. After a decade-long wait, he was picked for a T20 tournament last year; this year, he has surpassed his own expectations for the same tourney. We caught up with the man who defines tall, dark and handsome, and picked his brains about everything from   to his love life, all of which he answered sportily.

 
 
 Yes, definitely. The four years that I didn’t play competitive cricket helped me work a lot on my fitness and my state of mind. I was constantly working on my game and I never gave up. I have always got things the hard way, so I took it up as a challenge. It didn’t weigh down on me and I never cribbed about it. I kept thinking that whatever happens, happens for the best. So, I took it in the right spirit. It was a big learning experience, at the end of which, my mindset changed, I became a lot calmer and a better human being overall.
 
 
 
 All 15 players are my friends, and we share a good camaraderie. There are very few teams that don’t differentiate between seniors and juniors; our’s is one such where everyone is treated equally. Since we spend 4-5 months together at a stretch, we all hang out together, but the bond is so strong that it’s not like we have to go out always.
 
 
 
 The night before a game, I think about my strategy for it before going to bed. On the morning of the game, I call my parents and some friends.
 
 
 
 I pray every morning, so that’s about it.
 
 
 
 It’s a lot of fun. See, age is just a number, and you can have fun at 59 or 29. It’s just that you can explore new things in your 20s, since you can push your body further.
 
 
 
 Yes. We’ve been together for around eight years and are thinking about taking the relationship to the next level. That should happen soon, hopefully.
 
 
 
 It was the other way around.
 
 
 
 Actually, there was no asking involved as such. We connected very well. Before getting into a relationship, we met a few times, spoke on the phone and kept texting each other. Somewhere, there was a spark and we started dating.
 
 
 
 It’s an interest I developed 3-4 years ago. I like going into the forest, exploring wildlife and seeing how wild animals live. I would like to do something for wildlife in the future.
 
 
 
 I keep going to Kabini and Bandipur. I go there to understand the movements of the big cats and want to be able to spot them by myself, without the help of a guide. I want to explore the wildlife here first and then move on to Ranthambore and Tadoba.
 
 
 
 I spotted Prince (the legendary tiger of Bandipur, who passed away last year) a couple of times. I also spotted a leopard family in Kabini.
 
 
 
 I like travelling and go on several road trips. I want to go up north and explore the beauty of Kashmir. I will then plan something outside India.
 
 
 
 My house (laughs) and the ground ( ).

 * Around 10 years ago, I was in Goa with friends. I lost a bet, and at 3 am I had to run from the beach to my room in my underwear. Thankfully, there weren’t too many people on the beach.
 
 
 I throw the wet towel on the bed.
