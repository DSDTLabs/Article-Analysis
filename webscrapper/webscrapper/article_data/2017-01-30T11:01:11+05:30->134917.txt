  I m fully prepared and completely confident. Everyone knows that Congress does not stand any chance in Sitarganj. I am carrying forward my father's legacy who has not let any stone remain unturned for the development of this constituency. Besides the party cadre, I have my own support base in Sitarganj since I have been working here for almost five years.
  
  
 
  
  I may not be a Bengali but I belong to Sitarganj. My aim is not to work for only a specific community but for every section of society. People from all communities are giving their love and support to me which is evident in the turnout of my meetings. My father won the by-poll here with the biggest margin in the state and so will I.
  
  
  
  My father has always been influential in politics. But he does not seek anyone's help or ask for favours. The party found me a deserving and winning candidate so I was given a ticket. Also, let me clarify that I have never been a member of the Congress. BJP is the first party in which I have done active politics and I have tremendous support from the party cadre.
  
  
 
  
  There is no question of losing. I have been a golfer, the game is my passion and like a true sportsman, I am also fighting these polls to win. I am confident that I will enter the state assembly as a legislator from Sitarganj.
