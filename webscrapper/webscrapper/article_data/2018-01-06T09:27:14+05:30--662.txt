 "The decision has been taken to provide respite to school children across the district. While we have suspended classes for students till fifth standard, senior classes will continue as per the new schedule. After January 16, the classes will be held from 9am to 2pm till further notice," district superintendent of education ( )   said.
 
 The decision was welcomed by most parents. The sharp temperature drop in the past three days has seen the mercury hovering around 6 degrees celsius which is more than 2 degrees below normal.
