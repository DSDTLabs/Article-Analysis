AGRA: The raids on   in Uttar Pradesh have severely affected the state's   business and created a serious unemployment problem. According to exporters, orders worth Rs 4,000 crore have been cancelled and 30,000 workers have lost their jobs so far. 

  UP's meat processing units account for a substantial portion of exports from India. In the period from April to December 2016 alone, Rs 7,285 crore worth of buffalo meat was exported from the state. Lakhs of people are employed in abattoirs and meat shops. 
 
 Of 41 meat processing and export units in the state, 17 have been shut since the new government came to power. "The raids, coupled with the campaign by overzealous cow protection vigilantes, who have brought transportation of even buffaloes to a standstill, have led to acute shortage of animals, forcing these businesses to shut shop," revealed those involved in the trade.
 
  Fauzan Alavi, secretary of All India Meat and Livestock Exporters' Association, said, "Around Rs 4,000 crore worth of export orders had to be cancelled because of shortage of livestock. People in this business are too scared to transport animals," he said. 
 
 According to industry sources, the main supply of Indian buffalo meat goes to 70 countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and in the Middle East.
 
 General manager of Aligarh's Allana Exports, Ayaz Siddiqui, said their business had taken a huge hit. "Before the new government came to power, we were supplying 200 tonnes of meat from our Aligarh unit, worth Rs 40 crore per day, to various countries. Daily supplies have fallen to 35 tonnes now." HMA Agro Industry, which owns a unit each in Aligarh and Agra, has shut them both since March 21. Prashant Sharma, PR consultant with the plant, said, "All 600 workers in both plants had to be let go."
