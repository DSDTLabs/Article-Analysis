Aamir Khan's Christmas release 'Dangal', which also stars Fatima Sana Sheikh, Sanya Malhotra, Sakshi Tanwar, Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar, is roaring at the box-office. The sports drama, co-written and directed by Nitesh Tiwari, added Rs 10.46 crore more to its kitty on Day 12. The total domestic collection now stands at a staggering figure of Rs 295.14 crore.

 
 
 'Dangal,' which tells the story of Indian wrestler and coach Mahavir Singh Phogat and how he trained his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari to become world-class wrestlers, is just Rs 5 crore short of touching the Rs 300-crore mark. With its entry in the coveted Rs 300-crore club, 'Dangal' will become the fourth film to do so after 'PK', 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' and 'Sultan.'
 
 
 
 Also, if it crosses the 300-crore mark, 'Dangal' will dethrone Salman Khan's 'Sultan', which currently is the highest Bollywood grosser of 2016 with the collection of Rs 300.45 crore. 
 
 
 
 'Dangal' is enjoying a tax-free status in Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which is immensely benefitting its business at the ticket windows.
