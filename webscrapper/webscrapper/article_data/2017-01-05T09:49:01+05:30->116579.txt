BENGALURU: The   (NAAC), an   of the   (UGC), on Wednesday said the   for universities/colleges on its website are not the latest. 

 In the consolidated list of 706 colleges in Karnataka, the grades of some colleges have not been updated yet. The website shows grades of the previous cycle. If a college has received B grade in its second cycle and A grade in its third, there's no mention of the upgraded rating. MES College of Arts, Commerce and Science, Bengaluru, for instance, moved up to A grade in the last cycle of assessment. But there's no mention of the institution's upgraded rating on the website.
 
 When TOI brought this to the notice of NAAC director  , he said: "We have a team that updates this list as soon as each standing committee releases its report. However, if this is the case, we will ensure the list is updated immediately." 
 
 NAAC was set up to assess the quality of education in higher educational institutions.
