MUMBAI: The   benchmark cracked below the 30,000-level by dropping 133 points in early trade on Friday on emergence of profit-booking after yesterday's strong rally.

 Also, the NSE   was trading 32.35 points or 0.35 per cent lower at 9,327.55.
 
 Banking stocks were seen carrying forward the positive sentiment arising out of the government's decision to bring an ordinance to give greater powers to the Reserve Bank to tackle mounting bad loans.
 
 In the banking segment, shares of SBI, ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Federal Bank and Kotak Bank were trading higher by up to 3.76 per cent.
