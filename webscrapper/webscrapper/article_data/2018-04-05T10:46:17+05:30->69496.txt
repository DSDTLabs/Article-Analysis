Krishna Chitanya's directorial,   and   starrer '
 ', produced by  ,   Srinivas and Sudhacar Reddy released today amidst high expectations. This is Nithiin's 25th film, a landmark in his career. 

 Mohan Ranga (Nithiin) is a man who's in the rat race to shift to the US and make a life there. But he's not the kind to work hard and gain his entry there either. While he finds a shortcut to go to the US, he struggles to find a way to stay there. When he gets there, he meets NRI Megha (Megha Akash) who seems to have an overbearing mother and a free spirit. 
 
 The first half of the film also sees Madhu Nandan as Mohan's friend Vicky, Naresh and Pragathi as his parents and Rao Ramesh as his sponsor. So far the film has seen an extremely routine story, few silly humorous scenes and three peppy songs that somehow come across as underwhelming on-screen. It is only 'Miami' that looked halfway good.
 
 Nithiin has so far been decent in his role as Mohan Ranga, an aimless man who wants to just earn money so he can have material luxuries. Megha Akash seems to be incapable of emoting, with a smile frozen on her face even while her car is being seized and in any other scene in general.
 
 'Chal Mohan Ranga' has so far purely been an aimless and timepass ride, much like the titular character. It remains to be seen how the second half will fare and if the story and characters will be fleshed out.
