Pune: Faculty members and students at the Savitribai Phule Pune University can now hope for better services at the   on its campus.

 The facility is being upgraded, considering the recent incident of a student dying of heart attack and could not get emergency medical care on the campus. A special budget allocation is being set aside for equipping the centre to provide 24- hour emergency health care.
 
 The varsity administration has received several requests from students and staff members for better health facilities on the campus, especially for hostel students. 
 
 The facility so far functioned more like a primary health centre with an out patient department functioning in morning and evening hours.
 
 “We are conducting meetings with university officials and working on a plan to provide 24-hour emergency medical services. A report will be prepared soon and it will take at least two to three months to provide the necessary services,” said Shashikant Dudhgaonkar, who is in charge of the health centre.
 
 Special financial provisions will be made in the budget for enough working force. There are close to 54 departments within the   and there are at least 50 to 60 members working in each department. “Apart from this, there are thousands of students on the campus and non-teaching staff who need medical help from time to time. The health centre is unable to cater to the number of people on the campus. In such a situation, there is need for better services, especially in case of an emergency,” Kuldeep Ambekar, a student activist, said.
 
 Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor, SPPU, initiated steps to improve services at the centre after some students’ unions raised the issue. An ambulance service is now being provided to cater to emergencies.
