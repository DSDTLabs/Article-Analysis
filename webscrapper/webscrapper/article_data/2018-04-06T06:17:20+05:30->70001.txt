KOLKATA: A day after three members of the same family - a 62-year-old woman and her two sons - reportedly tried to commit suicide, leading to the death of one, the condition of the elderly woman  , continued to remain critical. 

 The cops said even Arijit (28), the younger of the two brothers were not in a position to be questioned at length. The elder son   (38) was declared dead at MR   on Wednesday.
 
 The sleuths probing the case said prima facie evidence shows the victims had been planning the suicide for some time. But given that they finally consumed poison at 2.30am, shows there were deliberation before putting words in to action. 
 
 "The victims had been visiting relatives over the weekend and had even been ordering food from outside. We believe these were the final preparations before they decided to take the final plunge," said an investigating officer from   police station.
