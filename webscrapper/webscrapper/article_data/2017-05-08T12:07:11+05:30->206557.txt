 and   made an appearance together this Saturday on Sony TV's  , where the former was seen playing his much loved character Dr Mashoor Gulati and the latter was Laila, his nurse. 
 
 The two entertained everyone on the reality show. While Sunil happily flirted and danced on 'Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast' with Raveena Tandon, Ali Asgar, too, left everyone in splits. Sunil also sang a few lines from 'Mere Husband Mujhko Piyar Nahi Karte'.
  
 The fun part of the entire act, however, was when Ali teased Sunil about the now infamous plane incident. 
 
  
  
 When  , the host of Sabse Bada Kalakaar, asked the two not to quarrel during one of the sequences, Ali was quick to point out, "Excuse me, jhagda toh yeh plane mein karte hai." (He fights in plane), referring to Sunil's fight with Kapil on Melbourne-Mumbai flight. 
  
 Not just that, while a group was performing in a plane, Ali asked Sunil if he is able to recall something. Sunil, this time, reacted by pushing him off his chair, making the audience applaud the entire act. 
  
 The kids reality show is judged by Raveena Tandon, Boman Irani and Anurag Basu.
