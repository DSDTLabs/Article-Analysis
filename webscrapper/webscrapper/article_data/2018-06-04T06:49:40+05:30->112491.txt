KOLKATA: A day after a student alleged that he was stripped naked and filmed inside a room of a central   near Sealdah, state education minister   said "strict action" will be taken against the guilty. 

 The video clip of the incident, which went viral on social media, showed the student pleading for mercy even as he was forced to remove his clothes in front of a group of people.
 
 Chatterjee, who received a written complaint from the student, told reporters that those found involved in the act would face consequences.
 
 "If the allegations were found to be true in the inquiry report of the college, the government will show 'zero tolerance' towards the crime," he said.
 
 The first-year student, who claimed to be a member of the   (TMCP) and secretary of the student's welfare unit of the college, told mediapersons on Saturday that he was subjected to torture by some senior members of the students' wing on May 17 when he inquired about the expenses incurred for arranging an upcoming event in the college.
 
 In his complaint, the victim reportedly named the college unit president and an outsider to have physically and mentally tortured him. He also alleged that while doing so, they also shot objectionable videos and photographs of him.
 
 TMCP state president Jaya Dutta said she will speak with the college authorities and TMCP members of the north Kolkata unit before taking a call on the matter. The union will take necessary action against its members, if they are found guilty, she said.
