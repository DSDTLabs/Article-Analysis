SRINAGAR: Barring a terror attack on an army patrol, injuring three soldiers, situation across Kashmir remained peaceful on Saturday, the first death anniversary of   commander  . 

  The day passed without any major clashes, since authorities had pre-emptively imposed curfew and suspended mobile internet services and even snapped broadband services to thwart attempts at mobilising stone-pelters. 
 
 The joint group of two Hurriyat factions and other separatists had called for a general strike and ' Tral chalo' (Let us go to Tral) march to commemorate the day. 
 
  Defence sources said three soldiers were injured after terrorists attacked an army patrol party of 13 Rashtriya Rifles, near community health centre in Hajin area of   district in north Kashmir around 5.30am. Minor incidents of stone-pelting were reported from parts of south Kashmir including Shopian and Kulgam districts. 
 
  Burhan Wani supporters pelted stones on security forces in his native town Tral. Reports said pro-Pakistan songs were played on loud speakers in local mosques in the town. 
 
 Despite strict restrictions in Tral, hundreds of people assembled at Wani's home in Shareefabad to pay respect to the slain terrorist. 
 
 A few stone-pelters were injured in the clashes with security forces, police said. 
 
  Meanwhile, PTI reported from Islamabad that Pakistan PM   and its army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa paid tributes to Wani.
