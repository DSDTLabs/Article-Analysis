TRICHY:   national secretary and   MP from the state   had to return without inaugurating a school building at   near   on Sunday evening after finding to his dismay that no one including the headmaster and officials representing the district administration had turned up for the function.

 The senior parliamentarian was to open a new building of a government higher secondary school at Puthanatham constructed using his MPLAD fund af ter a meeting of party workers in the village. “I had come to open the building but could not find anyone from the concerned departments. Hence I chose to do it at another appropriate occasion and left for a party meeting,“ Raja told TOI over phone.
 
 The CPI leader said that the school was meant for all. He said he would open it only in the presence of all stakeholders. However, the MP chose not to blame anyone for the unavailability of officials.
 
 When contacted, school headmaster   said the function was scheduled for 5pm and he had waited there till 7pm but the MP did not turn up.
 
 “I could not stay beyond 7pm due to my illness and had to leave the spot. Later I received a call from the MP himself to whom I expressed my inability. The MP told me over phone that he would come on another occasion to inaugurate the building,“ he said.
 
 The district administration claimed that it had no knowledge of the MP's programme at the school.
