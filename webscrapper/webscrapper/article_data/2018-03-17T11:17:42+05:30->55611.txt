  I completed a diploma course in acting in 2008 and bagged a blink-and-miss role in Basundhara. I remember I was in   when I got a call from the channel for this serial. They saw my photos on Facebook and thought I was ideal for the lead role. They did a look test after I returned and soon, I was on board! The character Gobindo is a dream for any actor. Now, I feel I can do any character with ease, as Gobindo 
 has a lot of shades and helped me 
 grow as an actor. What’s more, I don’t need glycerine to do emotional scenes anymore
 
 Life has taken a 360-degree turn. Now, I can’t go to Gariahat for shopping. When people see me, they exclaim, ‘Oi dekh Gobindo’, and they want to click selfies with me. I love it, as this is what I always wanted. When I go for macha shows, thousands shout that they love me and ask me to say the famous Gobindo dialogue: ‘Ranna kora, bason maja, kapor kacha, kutno kata, juto selai theke chondi path sob korteh pari; naam ta mone rakhben, Go-bin-do!’
