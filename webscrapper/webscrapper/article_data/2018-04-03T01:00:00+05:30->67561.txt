AURANGABAD: Anil Singh, who had escaped from police custody after his arrest for inciting   in Aurangabad district on March 25 and 26, surrendered before the chief judicial magistrate on Monday. He was sent to judicial custody of 14 days. Anil is the state convener of Hindu Yuva, a right wing outfit. 

 Anil, along with 150 other persons, is accused of setting ablaze properties during the riots in the district on Ram Navami on March 25. Anil managed to escape from police custody on Thursday last and he was declared absconder by the court.
 
 On Monday, Anil reached the court in the garb of a labourer to evade police. His advocates prayed for his bail, but the court sent him to judicial custody and called for the case diary. His bail plea would be heard on Tuesday.
 
 Before surrendering in the court, Anil told the media he was innocent. “I was never arrested and a false case has been lodged against me. I was not involved in the any violence and the local administration is dragging my name to defame the NDA government,” Anil said. 
 
 He said there were more than 40 CCTV cameras in the areas of violence, but the police had not released even a single footage to show the involvement of any BJP worker in the riots.
