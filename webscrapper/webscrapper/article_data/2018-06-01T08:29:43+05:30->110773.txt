CHENNAI: A tarred road, a dirt path, a lush lawn and 10 steps leading into a house   C Mohan made a mental note of all this as he and his son-in-law Manickam were led blindfolded by their abductors into a property off   on May 25. On Wednesday, a week after the two were freed for a ransom of 33 lakh and 28 sovereigns of   jewllery, Mohan retraced the same path, like in the 1978 Rajinikanth-starrer ‘Priya’. This time with a police team in tow.

 Mohan’s account of the texture of the ground he walked on was the only lead investigating officers had, but after combing five farmhouses, the police party struck gold. They found the house where Mohan and Manickam were held captive on May 25. After questioning the guard, who turned out to be one of the accused, Chellapandi, the special team headed by Vadapalani assistant commissioner Shankar, inspector (L&O) Chandru and inspector (crime) Pasupathy, nabbed the rest. While Suthir Kumar, 33, Sheik Dawood, 23, Nanda Kumar, 23 and Srinivasan, 33, were arrested from a hideout at Vadapalani, Vinoth, 23, and Mani, 27 surrendered at the magistrate court on Thursday. A hunt is on for Krishnaraj, 35, the main accused.
 
 A police officer said that on April 23, Krishnaraj approached the finance company that Mohan runs with four others in Vadapalani. Giving his name as Saravana Kumar, he said he wanted a loan of Rs 20 lakh for an OMR-based medical equipment manufacturer.
 
 On May 25, Mohan and Manickam decided to visit the manufacturing unit at  . Krishnaraj and Shaik Dawood, who came to Mohan’s residence, offered to drive them there but abducted them near Selaiyur and took them to the farmhouse. The arrested men told investigators Suthir and Krishnaraj were partners in an Ambattur firm which went bust. Owing Krishnaraj Rs 10 lakh, Suthir told him kidnapping a financier for ransom would fetch a good sum. Krishnaraj planned the kinap which finally came apart.
