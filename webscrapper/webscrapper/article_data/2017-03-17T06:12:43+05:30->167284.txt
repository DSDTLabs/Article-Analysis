INDORE: District administration on Wednesday issued a show cause   to the owner of a   and the event manager asking them to submit an answer on why they failed to abide by the rules given by the authorities for Holi celebrations.

 The owner and the event manager of R9 club were issued a   by sub divisional magistrate ( ) Vijay Nagar on Wednesday.
 
 The letter said that even when they were authorized not to use a swimming pool, have a DJ nor serve alcohol, they did not follow the rules. 
 
 The organizers were asked to submit an answer by 12:00 pm on March 20 at the SDM’s office.
 
 Meanwhile, DIG Harinarayanchari Mishra on Wednesday ordered all in-charges of police stations in Indore district to keep strict vigil on all the pool clubs under their jurisdiction.
 
 “I have asked them to check if the pool clubs in their areas are operating with appropriate licenses. If they don’t have all the licenses required, we will initiate strict actions against them,” DIG Mishra told TOI.
 
 The action was triggered after two minor girls were eve-teased in an area under Aerodrome police station while they were returning from a coaching institute. The alleged accused were said to be in the area to participate in a pool party organized for Holi.
 
 They initially approached the girls and tried to put colour them. But later, they allegedly tore the girls’ clothes. Frightened, the girls tried to run and hide and were later rescued and dropped home by a resident of the area.
 
 Meanwhile, collector P Narhari claimed that the administration was also keeping an eye on all those who are operating without appropriate licenses.
