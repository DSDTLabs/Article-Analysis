KOLKATA: The deadlock between   and   continued on Thursday, with an official of the   reporting that less than 3% have opted for Star channels since it removed them from packages and offered them separately against additional payment. SitiCable has made it clear it will not continue with the fixed-fee agreement with Star India if the broadcaster insisted on a 110% fee hike.

 Since last weekend, Star channels have gone off Siti-Cable packages that are beamed into 12 lakh homes in Kolkata and 23 lakh more in the rest of the state. “Since then, some households have opted for Star Jalsha, some have taken Star Plus, a few have opted for Jalsha Movies as the   is being screened on the channel. But people have mostly switched to alternatives offered by other broadcasters,” the official told TOI.
 
 The fee hike, officials said, would lead to steep rise in package prices.
 
 “Why burden the subscriber with 64 channels that cost abomb when all he or she may be interested in are three or four and can purchase them à la carte? We have told Star we will sign a fixed-fee pact only if the hike is reasonable. Or else, we want to shift to Reference Interconnect Offer (RIO), where subscribers can individually opt for a pay channel and pay for it in addition to the basic package,” the SitiCable official said.
 
 Though Star India claimed that 33% people watch its channels, SitiCable officials countered that if people had to pay for individual channels, the number would slide drastically, leading to a drop in TRP and broadcaster’s revenues from advertisements. Which is why, they said, Star India was reluctant to switch to RIO.
 
 Star India has pointed to SitiCable’s increase in subscriber base to demand a fresh audit, but the MSO refused, arguing that fixed-fee payment was irrespective of consumer numbers.
