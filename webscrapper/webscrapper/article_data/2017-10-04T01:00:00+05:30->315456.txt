Here’s another youngster from Chennai who went all the way to Canada and won the   in July this year.  , an 18-year-old student of   (Ramapuram campus), was part of the 19-member crew called   that represented India in the championship. The young dancer is quite excited that he has come this far after he joined dance classes only to lose weight when he was a teenager. “I was a little plump when I was a teenager. My mother would tell me that she would buy me pizza only if I attended dance classes. So, the intention of joining dance classes back then was to lose weight. But I slowly got hooked on to it,” says Jaswanth with a smile. 
So, how did he get selected to be a part of the crew to represent the country? “There was video audition last year. I also sent a dance video of mine and that’s how I got selected. There are dancers from different parts of the country and we first went for the Hip Hop International in Las Vegas, last year. There, we missed out entering the semi finals just by a small margin. We came back and prepared for the championship in Canada for about 14 months. We practised day and night. I missed a lot of classes in college. But that’s OK. I am really happy that we actually won what we really strived for,” he replies. His inspirations? “My biggest inspiration is American dancer and choreographer Don Campbellock,” says Jaswanth, who loves dancing to punk music the most.
