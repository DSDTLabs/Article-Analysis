PUNE: The sudden closure of the two lounge-cum-restaurants at the Pune   has stumped the airlines who say the move will hit them and the passengers hard.

 The two lounges located in the departure area are mainly used by the business class passengers.  , a Mumbai-based group, had been operating the lounges along with some food outlets inside the terminal building. As the lounges have been shut down, even the food outlets are not working.
 
 “One of the lounges is near the check-in area, while access to the other can be gained after clearing the security check. Some airlines serve refreshments to their passengers — in case of flight-delays — by getting food items from the lounge.If a flight gets delayed now, we will be in a fix,” an airline official said.
 
 “The lounges were closed on January 25 because the contract between the operator and the AAI-Pune had ended. But, even after three days, the lounges are still closed. If the AAI did not have a new contractor, why did it not give an extension to the old one?” an airline official asked and added, “We have received oral complaints from passengers.”
