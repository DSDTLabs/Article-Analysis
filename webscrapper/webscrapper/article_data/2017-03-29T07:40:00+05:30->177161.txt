BATHINDA: No applications have been received in Bathinda for seven groups of liquor vends and in   for five groups. In the absence of any application in the stipulated time up to Monday evening, liquor vends auction was cancelled on Tuesday at both places. 

 Bathinda district was to collect Rs 184.59 crore as licence fee whereas Rs 111 crore was to be collected at Faridkot after the auction.
 
 The next date of allotment will be notified again. In the 2016-17 financial year, only three groups were formed for all liquor vends in Bathinda. For the coming fiscal seven groups had been formed to allow more contenders to pitch in but this evoked little interest among contractors.
 
 Apart from losing interest in getting the liquor vends for the coming fiscal , the contractors of Bathinda still have to pay Rs 62 crore as licence fee for 2016-17 with only three days of the fiscal year to end. To recover the dues, the excise and taxation department authorities have even started identifying the properties of defaulters for getting these attached.
 
 Bathinda assistant excise and taxation commissioner ( ) Veer Parkash Singh said that, “Contractors were asked to send applications by the evening of March 27. No application was received in the stipulated time and draw of lots proposed on Wednesday stands cancelled. A new notification will be made in due course of time.”
 
 Faridkot AETC S P S Grewal said that, “No application has been filed by the contractors for any of the five groups. The licence fee of Rs 111 crore is to be collected in the coming fiscal from the district.”
