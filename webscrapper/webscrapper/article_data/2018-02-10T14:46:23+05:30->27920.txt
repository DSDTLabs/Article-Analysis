INDORE: An advocate on Thursday made a complaint against MY Hospital superintendent Dr VS Pal accusing him of violating the rules by running a clinic without obtaining the required permissions.

 In his complaint to chief medical and health officer ( ) Dr HN Nayak and MGM medical college dean Dr  , advocate   alleged that Dr Pal was running a clinic in Alankar Point Apartment at   against service norms for government doctors.
 
 “The clinic was also not registered at CMHO office,” Gupta alleged in the complaint.
 
 The complainant urged the officials concerned to look into the matter as private practice by the government doctor is a violation of Sub-rule (4) of Rule 16 of   Conduct Rules 1965 and is punishable.
 
 “Dr Pal’s act is objectionable and is a punishable offence. An investigation into the matter is required” Gupta said.
 
 “As per the rules, the government doctors are not permitted to render their service including consultation at any private nursing home, private hospital or clinic. The doctors, serving in government facility, can only provide consultation from their residence only after the duty hours and therefore, they can keep only basic medical examination equipment,” Dr Nayak told TOI.
 
 Referring to the ‘rules’, CMHO put the ball in dean’s court citing that Dr Thora is authorized to seek any explanation from Dr Pal to decide further course of action in the matter.
 
 “I have come to know about the complaint against Dr Pal running a private clinic through media but yet to receive it on my table. Once received, I will issue notice seeking explanation in the matter,” Dr Thora said.
 
 Dr Pal did not respond to queries on the complaint made against him.
