NEW DELHI: Braving the cold, many cancer   spend their night on the pavement outside   and Safdarjung in hope of getting better. Though the   list is long, patients’ families run from pillar to post to get the treatment started.

 Khurshid Jahan (42) was diagnosed with abdominal   last year. She was advised nine rounds of chemotherapy. “But after six rounds, I was discharged from AIIMS. Doctors asked me to come again after a few months for the remaining rounds,” said Khurshid, who is waiting for her turn.
 
 Sita (42), from Etawah, had to wait for a month to get a bed in Safdarjung Hospital. “On December 2, 2016 I was referred to Safdarjung. It took a month to get her a bed here,” said Khilauna Singh, her husband.
 
 While some are lucky, there are many who had to opt for private hospitals as time was running out. 
 
 Sunita lost her sister-in-law to cancer two years back. She tried to get an appointment at AIIMS. But the long   made it impossible to get her treated there. 
 
 “She was in advance stage. Doctors said she needed a surgery. But it was difficult to get a bed. As her condition was deteriorating, we had to admit her in a private hospital,” Sunita said.
 
 There are many who come here as they aren’t sure about the diagnosis done by doctors in their villages or cities. Dilbari (52) has come from Amroha to get her check-up done as she has cancer-like symptoms. “Past three months she has been undergoing cancer treatment, but we aren’t sure. We are waiting to get a bed in Safdarjung Hospital,” said Dilbari’s son.
 
  Experts said cancer treatment facilities in public sector is far less than needed, particularly in the north. “Nearly 70% of patients coming to our hospital are from UP, Bihar, Haryana and Punjab,” said Dr R K Grover, director Delhi State Cancer Institute.
