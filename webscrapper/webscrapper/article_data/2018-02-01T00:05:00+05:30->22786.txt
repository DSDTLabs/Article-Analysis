All about colours and creativity, crayons are every child’s magic wand that can turn their imagination into reality on a drawing book. But imagine a day when these sticks of coloured wax hop out of the box and start complaining about their odd problems. A new play in the city, titled 
 , have characters impersonating crayons, and they all want to share their experiences on stage.

  Directed by  , this 45-minute theatrical is an adaptation of American author Drew Daywalt’s book by the same name. Created by city-based   house  , the play is set to premiere at   over the weekend. Although it’s a children’s drama, all the five actors in the play are adults — Kavya, Sreecharan, Kelly, Ridhi and Jimmy.
 
  Describing 
  as an interactive piece of theatre, Anna says, “We have tried our best to make the play as engaging as possible. Although kids are introduced to a lot of new things at home and school, most of them tend to be quite repetitive in their behaviour and preferences. Through this play, we want to inspire them to try out new things every day. It is a visually-attractive play, complete with music and quirky tricks with thread and rope. It has a message both for parents and their tiny tots.”
