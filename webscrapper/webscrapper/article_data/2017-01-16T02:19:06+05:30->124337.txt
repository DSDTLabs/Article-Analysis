MUMBAI: The   Kranti Muk   will be held in Mumbai on March 6, the first day of the scheduled state budget session.

 The district representatives of the Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM) outfit held a meeting at Bharatiya Krida Mandir in Wadala on Sunday to finalize the date of the   march. A ‘chakka jam’ across Maharashtra, except Mumbai, region is planned ahead of silent march. 
 
 “To grab the attention of the government towards Maratha reservation issue, the date has been decided unanimously,” said Bhaiya Patil, an MKM activist. The community has held several rallies after the July 2016 gangrape-murder of a Maratha girl by Dalit youths in Kopardi.
