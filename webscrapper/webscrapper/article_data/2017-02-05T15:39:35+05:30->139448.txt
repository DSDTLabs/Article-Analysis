Actress Sarah Jessica   has said she is 'unclear' about how much private information she should share on social media. 

 The 51-year-old star revealed that she is unsure about how much she should actually engage with the world online.
 
  
  
 "I'm not easy with (social media and technology) and I'm unclear of my own boundaries. I'm unclear of how much I want to engage and how to have it not be a personal experience and how to have conversations that I think are productive with people when they're feeling anxious or angry or they're wanting to say unfriendly things," Parker said.
