JAIPUR: Industries minister   has slammed former chief minister   and PCC chief Sachin Pilot for statements against the three-day   Divas in a press statement at BJP office on Friday.

 Gehlot accused Raje government of misusing tax payers’ money in the festivals related to Rajasthan Divas and questioned the seating arrangement by saying it has no priority for commoners. “Gehlot has been the CM of the state twice. It is highly unfortunate that Gehlot is releasing false statements to garner political points. It is unfortunate,” said Shekawat.
 
 The industries minister calls the Pilot insensitive for terming the Rajasthan Divas program ‘Aadamber’ (show-off). “The colourful culture and heritage of Rajasthan is inspiring India and the world. Calling it a display of state’s culture as a ‘show-off’ shows the disregard for the state,” said Pilot.
 
 He clarified that state is ensuring participation of common people in all its programs. “I would like to remind Gehlot that the Pravasi Bhartiya Divas in 2012 held in Jaipur saw no presence Rajasthanis,” said Shekawat. Both the leaders are making false claims and releasing fake statements. “The cannot tolerate the fact the event passed successfully,” said Shekawat.
