 Ajay Chopra, director of   surrendered before the court after the   rejected his interim bail petition on April 18. The Apex court had directed Chopra to surrender within 14 days. 
 
 “The court handed over Chopra to us and we subsequently arrested him. He will be produced before the same   court on Wednesday,” additional SP (ACB)   told TOI.
 
 The   (ACB) had registered five separate cases in connection with the alleged ad scam. However, the ACB arrested Chopra only in one of these cases on Tuesday. The ACB in its FIRs alleged that Chopra and some government officials siphoned off money in lieu of government advertisements.
 
 “Chopra has been arrested in FIR number 408 in which he and other persons allegedly forged bills and took payments worth Rs 1 crore,” Choudhary told TOI, adding that advertisements for about 175 cable operators in the state were issued and the cable operators were given a video CD to run the advertisements on government’s flagship schemes like ‘Jal hai to kal hai’, Mukha Manti Shahri Away Yojna’, etc. 
 
 When ACB investigated the list of 175 cable operators, it found that in many cases the accused forged documents and bills and received payments. “In many cases, the accused took payment on behalf of the cable operator despite the fact that the particular cable operator never ran the advertisement nor was he given any money. We also questioned the cable operators and they said they were never contacted by anybody from the government to run any television commercials,” the ACB official said.
