KOCHI:   ( ) is chalking up plans to convert the   (T2) into a terminal exclusively reserved for  . 

 "Once the new terminal is completed, all international flights will be eventually moved to T3. After which the current international terminal (T1) will undergo renovations before being converted into the new domestic terminal. These renovations would cost up to Rs 100 crores," said airport director Chandrakumaran Nair A . 
 
 Once T1 is converted into a fully functional domestic terminal then Cial management would consider converting the T2 into a terminal exclusively reserved for business jets.
 
 In 2016, Cial recorded 780 arrivals and 785 departures of chartered flights from their airport facility. In the previous year, Cial recorded 822 arrivals and 814 departures.
 
 "We have two flights that fly in and out of Kochi daily. Apart from that, we have around 3 flights that fly in and out daily. Revenue chartered flights only account for a meagre percentage," said Nair.
 
 "People who use private jets are running short of time, so having an exclusive terminal will definitely serve the purpose," Eapen Kalapurakal, secretary of the  .
 
 He suggests that introducing a new terminal will send a healthy message to investors planning to invest in the city.
 
 Nair added that revenue is not the primary objective of this initiative, a landing costs would be the main source of income for this initiative. "It is being considered so that we can serve private jet flyers better," he said considering that minimum facility for this new terminal already exists as a part of the existing domestic terminal.
 
 "As of now Kochi is not a major spot for private jets, private jets are mostly booked for commercial centres like Bengaluru or Mumbai," said Bennie P O from Joy Jets, a Kochi-based private jet firm.
