Actress  , who was last seen in ' ', is all set to tie the knot with music arranger and DJ   on May 22. Kawal first spotted Priya with a common friend in December 2016 and what followed was wooing, Bollywood style.

 She confirms, “It’s true that I am getting married. It was love at first sight for Kawal, who told our common friend that he wants to marry me. He spoke to his family about me and requested my friend to get me to speak with my family, too. Soon, our families met and the roka was held on February 13. At first, I was sceptical about an arranged marriage as I didn’t know him too well. But after meeting him a few times, I realised that he is family-oriented. Like me, he is also old-school. In fact, he met my entire family before the roka, including the extended one.”
 
 The pre-wedding functions will kick off from May 21, with mehendi in the afternoon followed by sangeet and engagement. The Punjabi wedding will take place in a gurudwara in Raipur followed by lunch and reception.
 The actress will move to Raipur, Kawal’s hometown, post the wedding. “I plan to stay there till I get something interesting in terms of acting, which should be worth my time away from home,” she sums up. 
 
 Priya was earlier married to actor  , who tied the knot with actress Aparna Singh in December 2015 after separating from her.
