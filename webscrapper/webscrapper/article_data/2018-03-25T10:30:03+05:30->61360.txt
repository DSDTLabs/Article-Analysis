KOCHI: The Kerala state veterinary council disciplinary committee has asked the forest department officials to submit evidence against veterinarian Dr Abraham Tharakan, who had allegedly issued fitness certificates to seriously-injured elephants without properly examining them before they are paraded in  , on April 6 at district veterinary office, Ernakulam.

 The council was considering a complaint filed by forest officials that the veterinarian was repeatedly issuing fitness certificates to elephants without examining them. The latest trigger is the parading of an elephant, Kuttisankaran, with very open and clear wounds on his legs. “We went to the spot when we were informed by members of Society for Prevention of Cruelty against Animals ( ) that an elephant with open wound was being paraded at the Pattupurakkal Bhagavathy temple, Kakkanad. Though they promised to move the tusker out, they brought him back again,” said Anaz, assistant conservator of forests, social forestry, Ernakulam.
 
 
 He said that a complaint had already been filed on January 22 against the doctor for issuing a similar fitness certificate to a wounded   on the same day when he was said to be present at Ernakulam Siva temple for examining elephants there.
 
 “It is very clear that the elephant was injured, any person could see that. The doctor has obviously not even seen the elephant. As far as the temple authorities are concerned, they have the certificates,” he said. The elephant has since been missing.
 
 Heritage animal task force general secretary   said that the temple is located opposite to the office of Ernakulam district collector, who is the chairman of district committee for prevention of cruelty to elephants during festivals. “This elephant with wounds all over the body have three names - Kottarappilly Kuttisankaran, Kuruvath Kuttisankaran and Oottoly Kuttisankaran. It is now kept by an individual near Pudukad in Thrissur district.”
