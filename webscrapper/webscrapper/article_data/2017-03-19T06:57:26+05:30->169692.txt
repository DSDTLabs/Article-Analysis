GANDHINAGAR: Parents on Saturday once again gathered at   Bopal to protest fee increase. The   claimed that the stir was only by a small group of parents who had vested interests. 

 The parents demanded that the increase be withdrawn or they would meet the education minister and make a representation against the management. The school management said that the parents were instigated and led by a journalist from an   outlet. 
 
 The journalist, for the last two years, has been harassing the school, sometimes he poses as a parent and at other times as a mediaperson seeking favours.
