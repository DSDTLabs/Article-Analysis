Trichy: A group of farmers belonging to Tamizhaga Eri Mattrum Attru Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam staged a protest outside the collectorâ€™s office on Monday, demanding release of water from Mettur reservoir for samba cultivation.

 The farmers headed by sangam president P Viswanathan sat outside the office during the grievance day meeting and raised slogans against the state government for its inaction on samba cultivation. Police rushed to the spot and took the farmers to the district collector where P Viswanathan submitted a memorandum demanding release of water from the Mettur reservoir.
 
 After handing over the petition to the district collector, Viswanathan told reporters that the government had released water from the reservoir on September 20 last year when the water level was 79 feet. Due to this, water could not reach the tail-end areas of delta districts. As a result, many farmers suffered crop loss and committed suicide, he alleged.
 
 Viswanathan said that farmers hav commenced preparatory works to execute samba paddy cultivation at many places in the delta districts. As a total of 10000 cusecs has been released in Cauvery from Mettur for Cauvery Pushkaram event, the government should continue the release to facilitate the farmers across the delta districts to carry out their agriculture activities, he added.
