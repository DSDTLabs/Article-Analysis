NEW DELHI: In a major question mark on Pratt & Whitney (PW) engines being used on the Airbus A-320 new engine option (Neo) planes, the European Aviation Safety Agency ( ) has issued an emergency airworthiness directive warning of a potential “dual engine” inflight shutdown on A320neo-family aircraft powered by PW PW1100G geared turbofan (GTF) engines. India's biggest airline   and another budget carrier   use A-320 Neos powered by PW engines.

 Directorate General of Civil Aviation chief B S Bhullar said this alert sounded by EASA is being examined. An India-specific decision for IndiGo and GoAir Neos could be taken later today.
 
 An IndiGo spokesman said the airline has three Neos with the combination for which EASA has issued the emergency directive. 
 
 An Airbus spokesman said: “Following an issue identified on a limited number of recently delivered Pratt & Whitney GTF engines affecting the High Pressure Compressor aft hub, Airbus and Pratt & Whitney are assessing the situation.
 
 Pratt & Whitney, the engine manufacturer, is investigating the root cause of this new finding with the full support of Airbus. The efforts of both companies are directed to support customers and operators to minimize any disruption."
 
 "In line with standard airworthiness procedures, EASA, the European Aviation Safety Agency has published an Emergency Airworthiness Directive. Airbus has informed its affected A320neo customers and operators. To date, 113 Pratt & Whitney powered A320neo family aircraft are flying with 18 customers," Airbus spokesman added.
