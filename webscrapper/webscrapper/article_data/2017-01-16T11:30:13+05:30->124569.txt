CHENNAI: A student who scored poojyam (zero) in a test may not want to look at his mark sheet again, but what happens when an artist decides to travel in search of the many forms of the numerical? It was his love for poojyam that made young artist   check the power of the numeral using his artistic skills. 

 "Poojyam literally means a lot me. It records my transformation in life. As a result, it attains many forms in a series of my paintings, exploring the concept of the infinite void which in itself is nothing but created everything within itself," said Balaraman, whose solo exhibition "Poojyam: Exploration of infinity" is on at the   in the city. 
 
 Poojyam makes one realise that the universe is born, it thrives in the void and comes to an end in itself, according to Karthikeyan. 
 
 "At the same time, the void is also confirmation of the fact that whatever is in the universe has always been there to manifest itself when time comes," he said.
 
 Karthikeyan worked in the UK for long time, but what made him return to his native place was the influence of poojyam. 
 
 The poojyam doesn't have a beginning or an end and it can absorb all other numbers without affecting its own status.
 
 "When the numeral is expressed in writing, it looks like a dot (bindu) that travels forward ceaselessly in a straight line but take a round shape due to the gravitational pull of the centre ad-infinitum (anantham). This void has been realised as an endless straight line drawn into a circular shape due to the pull of the centre of gravity that encloses emptiness to confirm the void," Karthikeyan said.
 
 Karthikeyan, associate professor of textile design at the  , Chennai, said it was a challenge that he enjoyed. "I enjoyed doing works based on poojyam using oil on canvas. I have also done some acrylic on canvas. My journey in search of poojyam will continue," he said.
