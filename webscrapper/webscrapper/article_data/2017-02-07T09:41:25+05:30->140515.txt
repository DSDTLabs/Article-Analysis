GANDHINAGAR: Prime Minister   will be in Gandhinagar on International Women’s Day to address a national conference of women sarpanches scheduled on March 8 at Mahatma Mandir. Around 8,000 women sarpanches from across the country, including 6,000 from Gujarat are expected to attend the event.

 This will be Modi’s eighth visit to his home state since August 2016. 
 
 When asked,  , state panchayat and rural development minister, said, “The PM is likely to visit the Women   on International Women’s Day.”
 
 “To finalize plans of the event and to oversee things,  , secretary of Union panchayat ministry will visit Gujarat on Tuesday,” added Kavadia.
 
 Gujarat government’s panchayat and rural development department and the Union government are organizing the event.
 
 The PM’s visit has added significance considering his popularity among women voters, and that assembly elections will be held in the state this year. More than 10,000 village panchayats in the state had held elections recently, and 50% of the elected sarpanches are women.
 
 With BJP having lost face in district and taluka panchayat elections in 2015, Modi’s visit on Women’s Day may help to woo women sarpanches for the party, and also help to energize local cadres, said sources in the BJP.
