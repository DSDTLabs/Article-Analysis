NAGPUR: Shirish   was a Malaysia-based industrial designer for an international company who quit his job last year in order to be a ‘maker’. His definition is simple — a maker is the one who makes things; albeit not for money, but for one’s passion.

 Kaner delivered a talk on ‘Maker: An alternative lifestyle’ as part of Alag Angle’s latest adda held at Chitnavis Centre, Civil Lines, on Friday evening. Kaner spoke about his journey of adopting an alternative lifestyle to explore his creativity.
 
 “I left the job as I felt that more than being creative, I was simply organizing and managing my job. It felt rewarding when I was able to make a product. So I would rent a small room downstairs in my building and work secretly,” he said. As a child, he would open up a radio or try to fix a mixer. Today, he is able to fix most things in his house such as electric gadgets or do plumbing, and can also build things such as furniture or a bookshelf.
 
 “We are born makers. We slowly lose our interest in making things as we age, in the scheme of getting promotions, marriage and other things, which assume more importance. Today, getting a certificate is the driving force behind gaining knowledge,” he added.
 
 Kaner discussed different aspects of being a maker. A ‘maker to maker’ where two makers collaborate and access the expertise of others. ‘Maker to market’ model allows creations to find a commercial appeal whereas the concept of ‘maker enabler’ is about a maker who allows others to use his workspace and tools to create their own things and promote DIY activities. He also spoke about his own studio where he supports people who wish to build things.
 
 Makers also emphasize on sustainable development of environment and promotion of local culture. “When I made seats for Jimmy’s food truck, we made a deal that he would recommend me to those who wanted anything to be built, and I would hold my meeting near his stall. This helps local culture,” he said.
