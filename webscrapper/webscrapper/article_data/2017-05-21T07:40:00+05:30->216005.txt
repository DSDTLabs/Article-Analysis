Ghaziabad: Private schools in   have again started taking annual and development charges from parents, apart from ‘late fees’, after the report on extra charges by a three-member district committee set up on April 28 and released on May 11 was kept under wraps and forwarded to the state government by district magistrate Ministhy S.

 The parents complained that the absence of a public verdict on annual charges has given a handle to the schools which are now intentionally harassing parents by asking them not only the tuition fees and extra charges but also additional ‘late fees’ on the pretext of the delay in fee submission for several weeks because of the ongoing agitation.
 
 Terming it extortion, members of the All School Parents Association ( ) on Saturday submitted a memorandum to minister of state Atul Garg to immediately put a stay on the school's right to wilfully impose illegal charges on parents until the state government issues instructions and comes up with a proper plan. The parents have also sought the expediting of the decision-making process.
 
 When contacted, Mahendra Dev, joint director education,  , said, “The district committee has sent the report to the state government with a lot of details and nothing can be done before the state government takes a call. There is no concrete rule or regulation in this matter so far and the schools are using this fact to their advantage. We issued notices to the heads of over 10 private schools on Friday.”
