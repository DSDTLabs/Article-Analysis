NEW DELHI: Refuting charges of Swaraj India’s   regarding an education plan, the Delhi government on Sunday condemned the “deliberate misinformation about the students loan scheme”.

 In the current fiscal year, 400 loan assistance applications have been received, out of which more than 100 applicants have been sanctioned loans amounting to Rs 3.55 crore, said a government spokesperson. According to the   (SLBC) report, 54 students were sanctioned loans amounting to Rs 1.52 crore in the last fiscal year.
 
 Yadav had alleged that the government started a higher education guarantee scheme under which a maximum loan of Rs 10 lakh was to be granted to a person for pursuing higher studies. “But the government has granted only three loans till now, and capped it at Rs 3.15 lakh.” He also said the rest of the loans were financed through a scheme under the central government.
 
 However, according to a statement released by the government, “Delhi Higher Education and Skill Development Guarantee Scheme provides assistance for up to Rs 10 lakh without any collaterals. There are no predetermined slabs.” While three students have been sanctioned more than Rs 7.5 lakh each, others have been granted less, it added. 
 
 On financing loans through a central scheme, the statement said the loans were given exclusively under the   government’s scheme and “is not part of any loan assistance scheme provided by Government of India”. The spokesperson said a single-window portal, studentloan.delhi.gov.in, had all details about such loans. 
 
 Yadav had also brought up the issue of teacher recruitment, claiming that 44% of teaching positions in government schools are either vacant or have temporary teachers. The adviser to the education minister, Atishi Marlena, said on Saturday that the government had ordered exams to fill up 5,000 posts and Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board had conducted 21 exams.
