 Coimbatore: The Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) on Saturday unveiled its plans to observe February 3 as black day in protest against the police excess on   protesters on January 23 and urged the state government to set up a   to inquire police atrocities against students and youths on that day.
 
 They also condemned chief minister O Panneerselvam for misleading the state assembly on the students’ protest.
 
 We will observe February 3 as black day across the state. We will also stage protests in front of all government offices against the Centre’s anti-people policies and attempts to curb people’s protests,” said SDPI state leader K K S M Thehlan Bhagvi.
 
 Reiterating the party’s demand for a special judicial committee to inquire into complaints of police excesses, he said, “The committee should be headed by a retired judge and be independent of both the state and central governments. It should look into the exact extent of police force used on that day, the triggers and orders form higher officials and its impact.”
 
 Referring to the chief minister’s remarks on photographs showing vehicles with Bin Laden’s picture in the city, Bhagvi said, “The chief minister brought it up in the state assembly to justify their claims that anti-nationals and jihadists had joined the jallikattu protest. That’s a six-month old case. The state government and police are giving such statements to protect the policemen caught assaulting protesters.”
