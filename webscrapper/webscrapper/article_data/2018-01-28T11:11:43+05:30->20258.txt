KOTTAYAM: Anandashanmukha Temple at Edappadi near Pala, founded by social reformer Sree Narayana Guru, has been the epitome of communal harmony since its inception in 1927. Since then, scholars from various religions have been addressing believers here and even today this tradition continues.

 This year, the temple committee has invited renowned counsellor of the Capuchin Congregation Fr   for a discourse. He will be speaking on the topic ‘Family life and faith in god’ during the Makarappooya festival on Sunday at 2pm. “People from all religions come here and we also invite people from other religions for discourses. We don’t have a narrow mindset,” said K M Santhosh Kumar, patron of the temple.
 
 It was at this temple, the custom of removing ones shirt, before entering the temple, was changed. We were the first to raise a voice against this custom, he added.
 
 Meanwhile, Fr Puthenpurackal –who is known for his witty remarks and humorous stories on social media – said though he had spoken at many temples, the hype ahead of his talk was unprecedented. “Such an extensive build up to my talk is something I am seeing for the first time. Love should start in the family and it should transcend religion,” he added. Fr  , spokesperson of Pala diocese, Fr Mathew Kareethara, principal of Chavara Public School, Malayalam literary critic M M Basheer and   are among those who have rendered discourses here during the festival time in the past years.
