SHIMLA: Amid a tough stand taken by the   on the issue of pollution caused by unregulated   in ecologically sensitive Rohtang Pass,   government has decided to undertake a survey through a consultant for working out physical, ecological,   of areas from Vashisht, near Manali, to   and from there to Khoksar in Lahaul-Spiti district, including their catchment area and influence zones.

 The tribunal in an order on August 19 last year had directed the state government to conduct a survey and submit a report to it on the carrying capacity of areas beyond Vashisht and Rohtang Pass and up to Khoksar. 
 
 During the course of hearing, local commissioners appointed by the tribunal had filed their reports on Rohtang, in which various deficiencies had been pointed at. They had informed the tribunal that the chaos that presently exists in Manali would also reach areas near Rohtang and beyond, particularly Lahaul-Spiti, if appropriate regulatory steps were not taken and precautionary principle was not invoked in the state. According to them, with the commissioning of tunnel at Dundhi from Solang to Lahaul-Spiti valley a lot of unregulated and haphazard shops and buildings will be built, adjacent to the road, resulting in traffic congestion, environmental degradation and possibility of natural calamities like the one that happened in Uttarakhand in 2013 cannot be ruled out.
 
 Now, in the compliance of this order, director of Town and Country Planning Department has started the process to hire consultants for the study that would also include factors affecting the overall capacity of the study area like access, commercial, construction, service, transport capacities, etc. 
 
 The study will also suggest as to what regulatory steps can be taken to prevent construction on roads or on those immediately adjacent to these. Sources said the consultant would also submit a complete regulatory plan depending upon the carrying capacity while avoiding any damage or loss to the ecology and environment in these areas, particularly loss or damage to water bodies. 
 
 The consultant hired for the study would have to submit the final report to the state government in 150 days from the date of award of work while the final report would be submitted to the tribunal in 180 days from the date of award of work.
