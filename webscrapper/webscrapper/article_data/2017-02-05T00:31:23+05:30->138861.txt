NEW DELHI: A seven-member committee, set up by the Centre, is drawing the blueprint to set up five world class   in different parts of the country to provide a mix of academic, technical and skill-based   with a focus on minority communities.

 Minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas   said that 40% of the seats in these institutes, which the government plans to start by next year, will be reserved for girls from the minority communities.
 
 While explaining how his ministry plans to utilise the Budget allocations, Naqvi said the focus will be on education and skill development.
 
 “Empowering minorities will be the focus area of the NDA government during the next fiscal,” he asserted. “The government has hiked allocation for the ministry’s spending under the Prime Minister’s new 15-point programme by 19% vis-à-vis the current fiscal,” he said.
 
 Naqvi said, “Since the seven-member committee was set-up in December, around 16 states have come forward to express their interest in providing land for setting up the institutes.” The committee was given two months to submit a roadmap for setting up these institutes. “We are working on a strategy so that these institutes can get started in 2018,” Naqvi said. The ministry is projecting these proposed institutions to evolve into “ideal centres of employment-oriented education”.
