NAGPUR: Power supply to   corporator Bunty  , who was not paying his bills since 2013, was finally disconnected by power franchisee  . The disconnection was done on Monday afternoon amid heavy police bandobast.

 Shelke’s home was earlier disconnected on November 22 last year but he connected his house to commercial meter in his premises and did not go without power for a long time.
 
 A source in SNDL said Shelke had paid the last bill in June 2013 and his dues had accumulated to over Rs 2.5 lakh in November. “The meter is in the name of his grandfather. We had disconnected it twice but he illegally restored the supply,” he said.
 
 Bunty had another meter in house, which registered very little consumption and hence its bill was being paid regularly. Shelkes smartly transferred the load of their house on to this meter. When shocked SNDL officials realized they had been outwitted, they began legal procedure for transferring arrears of the residential meter on the commercial one.
 
 Last month this process was completed and a SNDL team went to his house to disconnect power again. Realizing he was in trouble, the corporator agreed to pay half the amount on that day and the rest within a few days. The arrears at that time were Rs 2.7 lakh. Shelke paid Rs 90,000 in cash and promised to issue a cheque of Rs 45,000 in the evening. He changed his mind later and did not pay anything.
