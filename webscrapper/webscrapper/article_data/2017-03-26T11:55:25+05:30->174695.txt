SAHARSA: Tension prevails in Gamharia, Itahra and adjoining villages under the   OP of the Sour Bazaar block area following the murder of a   worker. Irate villagers in retaliation thrashed the assailant to death on Saturday.
 
  Apprehending escalation of violence, a large contingent of district police has been deployed for vigil and patrolling in the sensitive areas.
  
  According to police, the trouble arose when a youth, Vikas Kumar, raised objection to the construction of village road at Itahra village. Vikas had stopped the work on Friday too. As the workers refused to oblige him on Saturday, he opened fire at them. One Kari Mian died.
  
  A crowd of villagers gathered and thrashed Vikas mercilessly. He was rushed to the sadar hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.
  
  Kari’s friends and relatives blocked the   main road and paralysed the traffic for a couple of hours. The blockade was lifted after the intervention of senior police officers.
  
    (HQ) Ganpati Thakur claimed the situation was peaceful and well under control now. “One of the reasons of the trouble appeared to be a land dispute,” he said and did not rule out the possibility of dispute over the road construction contract as a reason.
