NASHIK: Women government employees across the district have demanded better facilities for female staffers working across various departments.

 These employees are a part of the Maharashtra State Gazetted Officers’ Federation. They submitted a   addressed to chief minister   through the district administration. 
 
 They have demanded a two-year  , a crèche for children, proper postings and basic amenities, including toilet facilities, in their offices.
 
 “We had approached the government several times with our demands, but there has been no response from the government,” a senior officer said. 
 
 Sarita Narke the deputy collector and district supply officer said that adequate maternity leave is necessary for government-employed women staffers. “We have now requested the state to take a decision on the matter,” Narke said.
 
 She recalled that in 2015, when she was working as the chief officer with the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada), she had requested the authority to allow maternity leave. Mhada agreed to the same for the   in the organisation.
 
 On the issue of postings, the members said that women employees are not given proper positions in the organisation. 
 
 “Except for the federation, the other employee organisations do not give a proper space to women colleagues. Because of this, women’s demands go unheard at the top level. The government therefore should draft some guidelines to ensure the women get proper representation in employees’ associations,” the memorandum addressed to the chief minister stated.
