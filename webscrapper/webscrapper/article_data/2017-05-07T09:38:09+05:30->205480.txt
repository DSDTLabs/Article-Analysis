PATNA: Two live surgeries were performed on the inaugural day of second ‘Bihar Knee and Shoulder Arthroscopy and Osteotomy’ workshop at the city’s Paras-HMRI hospital on Saturday.

 According to sources, 55 doctors participated in the workshop. While Mumbai’s Dr   performed ligament surgery, Dr John Mukopadhyay did the surgery for knee arthritis.

 Dr Mukopadhyay said knee replacement is not the solution for one and all, especially for the people belonging to the age group of 40-50 years. “We try to preserve the natural knee. Therefore, we perform   in which a cut is made in the bone for its realignment,” he said.
 
 The second ligament surgery was performed by Paras’s Dr   while osteotomy was done by Mumbai’s Dr  .
 
 A press release said the live surgeries were accompanied with lectures by the doctors performing them.
