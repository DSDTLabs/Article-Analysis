Actor   said his perspective on his friend and actor  's alleged sexual misconduct case is not relevant. In an interview the 36-year-old   spoke about the allegations made against Franco in recent months of sexual misconduct,according to a report.

 "The truth is that my perspective on this is the least relevant perspective. I'm friends with these people and I'm a dude," Rogen said.
 
 "All that combined makes me the last person who should be talking about this," he added. Rogen said the accusations haven't changed his willingness to work with Franco, 40, in the future. 
 
 On   11, a report revealed that five women had accused Franco of inappropriate behaviour on set or during acting classes. At that time, Franco said the allegations were "not accurate", but that he supports "people coming out and being able to have a voice".
