CHENNAI : DMK working president M K   on Sunday slammed a move by the Centre to introduce new guidelines for selecting candidates for   and other postings under Civil Services   conducted by the Union Public Service Commission ( ). The move, which will decide on selection and allotment of state cadre based on marks gained in the 100-day ‘foundation course’ to be conducted in Mussoorie, is against social justice and would be unfair to tribals, scheduled and backward classes, he said.

 The UPSC, which has been conducting the   examination, has been selecting candidates for various services based on their rank and the interviews. The allotment to various states too was beind done as per preferences of candidates, based on their performance. “Even here, candidates from the schedule caste, backward classes and tribals despite scoring high in the preliminary and finals were left wondering what went wrong after the interview. When youngsters were already pondering over this, the new guideline are shocking,” said Stalin.
 
 According to him, the social justice fabric has been managed well and the candidates from these segments have been doing great work after successful postings. “The   government, which claims to work for the welfare of dalits and tribals, has now come out with the new set of guidelines for selection, which even takes away the preference of states, through an initiative by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO),” Stalin pointed out.
 
 “If the initiative is from the PMO, then we should consider that it is from Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself. He came to power four years ago on a development plank and has been busy pushing communal agenda. With a new set of guidelines, the BJP and Modi are now introducing a kind of NEET in Civil Services too,” Stalin said. He urged the government to abandon any plans to change the system of selection and warned of protests if the government went ahead with the new guidelines.
