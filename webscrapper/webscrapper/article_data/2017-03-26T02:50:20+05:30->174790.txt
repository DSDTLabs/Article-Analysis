Ghaziabad: A constable was allegedly thrashed in full public view in   area on Saturday when he tried to resolve an argument between some   and a resident.

 One of the shopkeepers was detained but he was later allowed to go.
 
 On Saturday afternoon, Surender Singh, a resident, had come to Malliwara chowk along with his wife and child to see a doctor. A shopkeeper objected when Surender was parking his car. “I tried to explain that I am going to see a doctor and will be back shortly but he turned abusive. The argument turned ugly as other shopkeepers joined him and they started beating me in front of my wife and son. So I called police,” he said.
 
 As Dharmender reached the spot, along with another constable, a brawl broke out between the shopkeepers and the cops. Dharmender sustained injuries after shopkeepers thrashed him, said police.
