RANCHI: The rift between the members and the chairperson of the Jharkhand   (JSCPCR) was visible on Thursday when none of the five members of the commission turned up at a seminar organized by the child protection body. 

 The seminar on  , organized by Plan India in association with JSCPCR on Thursday, witnessed the presence of only the JSCPCR chairperson  .
 
 Kujur said, "All the members had been directed to attend the seminar and I don't know why they did not come."
 
 However, the members said that they had registered their disagreement with the chairperson a day ahead.  , a member said, "The members are unhappy with the chairperson's attitude. We were not informed about the plans of seminar and neither were we given a formal letter to attend it. On Wednesday, we all got a call and were asked to attend the seminar."
 
 As per the guidelines, all the members have to be sent a written letter informing them about the programme. "We were not even considered for discussion in conducting the seminar, leave aside being sent a formal letter for it. JSCPCR is not just about the chairperson, members have an equally important role in its functioning," Kumar said.
 
 The members have accused the chairperson for not being interested in the welfare of children. As per the guidelines, JSCPCR meeting has to be conducted at least once every month but here the meeting has not been conducted for over seven months. 
 
 "Even the decisions that were taken in the meeting seven months ago, have not yet been implemented. Since the chairperson joined, not a single public hearing has been organized by the committee. Also, she promised introduction of toll free number and website, none of which came to existence," Kumar said.
 
 The members have decided to conduct a meeting on January 19 to discuss these problems and take a stern decision on the matter.
