LUCKNOW: Eleven municipal corporations of the state now have smart LED streetlights instead of conventional ones. 

 At a function in   on Monday evening, chief minister   announced that 11 municipal corporations in the state have switched over to energy-saving LED streetlights with a central control system. This means they do not have to be switched on and off manually. To demonstrate the same, lights in Lucknow and Varanasi were switched on using a web-based centralised control and monitoring system.
 
 "This initiative will enable   to save around 40 crore kilowatt of energy annually. Additionally, this will reduce 35 crore tonnes of annual carbon dioxide emission translating to annual savings of Rs 280 crore," said chief minister Yogi Adityanath.
 
 As many as 5,75,000 conventional streetlights have been replaced by LEDs since September 2017 as part of the Centre's 'Street Light National Programme', said   (EESL) chairman Rajeev Sharma.
 
 These include 1.4 lakh streetlights in Lucknow, 38,500 in Varanasi, and 4,700 heritage LED streetlight systems under HRIDAY scheme, leading to a cumulative annual energy savings of Rs 85 crore, said EESL MD  .
 
 The other cities are Allahabad, Aligarh, Meerut, Firozabad, Mathura-Vrindavan, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Kanpur and Agra. The lights have been provided to municipal corporations by EESL, a Central government enterprise. In the first phase, EESL had signed an agreement with state's urban development department for 15 municipal corporations. 
 
 The municipal corporations did not have to make an upfront payment for the lights. The amount will be repaid to the company over a period of seven years from the municipal corporations' energy savings. Besides, 40 lakh smart meters and 1 crore prepaid meters will also be provided by EESL which is making a total investment of Rs 1,000 crore in 15 corporations.
