DEHRADUN: A hand grenade was found inside the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) colony on Sunday afternoon triggering panic among residents. Police said that local residents informed about the explosive lying in an open land inside the colony around 11.45 am.   A bomb disposal squad was immediately rushed to the spot and the grenade was taken to the Maldevta firing range to diffuse it. It had explosives and was found without a safety pin, informed officials.    “A local resident informed the police control room about the grenade,” said Hemandra Singh negi, in charge of Raipur police station.    Divulging more details, inspector Negi said, “Prima facie, it appears that the grenade was used by the Army during firing practice at Maldevta firing range. It might not have blasted during the drill and subsequently scrap dealers who frequent the firing range may have picked it up.”
