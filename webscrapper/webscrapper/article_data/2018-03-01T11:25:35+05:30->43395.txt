PUNE: Organisers of the   franchise in India have given Pune a miss this year, despite a heavy attendance of enthusiasts during the past two editions, due to the lack of a permanent venue. 
 
 The Pune Comic Con was one of five such events in the country, inspired and licensed by the Comic Con franchise in the Unites States. It was the first Comic Con in the 2017 calendar year. Other Comic Cons, organized in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and in Hyderabad, are scheduled later this year. 
  
 The 2016 and 2017 editions in Pune were held at the Deccan College grounds near Vishrantwadi, with the 2016 event being billed as an ‘express’ event, where organizers test the popularity of the Comic Con before a full launch. In 2017, about 18,000 participants were seen at the event between March 4 and 5. 
  
 “We are not organizing a Comic Con this year in Pune because we could not get a permanent venue for the event,” said a source from  , the official licensee for the events in the country. Jatin Verma, founder of Comic Con India, could not be reached for comment. 
  
 The source added that the Deccan College grounds were designated as the temporary venue of the Comic Con, while the search for a permanent location was on. “As far as I know, there was no approach by the Comic Con to hold the event again at the grounds this year,” said an official of the Deccan College. 
  
 Students of MIT college, however, organized their own Comic Con in the city earlier this month, complete with cosplay competitions and quizzes about various comic book superheroes.
