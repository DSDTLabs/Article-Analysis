THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Taking a different view from the stand taken by the state government at the high court finance minister   said the government would support to Kerala State Road Transport Corporation for its financial restructuring. 

 In an affidavit submitted by additional secretary of transport in the high court, the government had stated that the financial burden on government regarding   had reached a breaking point and any further financial commitment could be taken.
 
 However, state   T M Thomas Isaac said in a   post said the government would continue its support to the KSRTC. "Government taking over the responsibility to pay the pension, will not clear the liabilities of KSRTC. Financial assistance of Rs 1,500 crore has been provided directly or indirectly to KSRTC in this financial year. And another Rs 1,000 crore will be allotted to KSRTC in the next two years," said Isaac. The FM said the government could not take over the responsibility of payment of pension in KSRTC, but would continue its support for the financial restructuring of the corporation.
 
 Meanwhile, the trade unions of KSRTC claimed that the government was bound to provide financial aid as pension and travel allowances in KSRTC was introduced as per its directive. 
 
 "We demand that the affidavit submitted by the state government representative in the high court should be withdrawn and the government should take over the responsibility of payment of pension. For financial restructuring, the KSRTC needs to clear the liability of loans, for which a long-term loan from consortium of banks should be arranged by the government," said Kerala State Transport Employees Union (AITUC) general secretary M G Rahul.
