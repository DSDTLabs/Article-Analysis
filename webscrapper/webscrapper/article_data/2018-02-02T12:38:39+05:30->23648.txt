Patna: Eight months after the seizure of 1,070 cartons of wine at Kashichak in Nawada district, the Patna   (HC) on Thursday asked the state government to release the consignment within two weeks. 

 A division bench of Chief Justice   and Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay passed the order while hearing a writ petition filed by Nepalese firm   that had imported the exotic wine inside a sealed container from   in Australia. The container, after being docked at Haldia port in Kolkata, was on way to Kathmandu via road when it was seized by police at Kashichak in Nawada district for violation of prohibition laws on May 2 last year. Truck driver Dilip Sharma was arrested and police sought permission for destruction of the consignment. The firm then moved the court to get the consignment released.
 
 While lawyers like Y V Giri, Nikhil Kumar Agrawal and Aditi Hansaria were representing the firm, the state was represented by advocate general Lalit Kishore.
 
 “The court has asked police to take the truck with the consignment to the Indo-Nepal border and hand it over to the firm authorities in two weeks. The vehicle will return to Nawada and a decision to release it will be taken later,” Agrawal said, adding the Nepalese firm had to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs 8 lakh before the district magistrate of Nawada.
 
 Earlier on January 16, the bench had ordered the government to send a police team to Kathmandu to verify the firm’s background before taking any decision on releasing the consignment.
