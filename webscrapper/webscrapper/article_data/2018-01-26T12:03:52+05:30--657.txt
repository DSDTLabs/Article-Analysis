Amid widespread violence over 'Padmavaat', Delhi Deputy Chief Minister   said that he, along with some Rajput leaders, will watch the movie to see what is exactly shown it. 

 Talking to reporters, Sisodia said he is also a Rajput, and slammed "some people who are defaming" the community with their violent actions. 
 
  
  
 He said that being the education minister of Delhi, it was his responsibility to ensure that parents were assured of their wards' safety, remarks coming a day after a school bus with children on-board was attacked by a mob in adjoining Gurgaon. 
 
 "I have invited many Rajput leaders to talk on the recent developments of violence. We are totally against these acts. Some miscreants, who are indulging in violence protest, do not belong to the Rajput community.
 
 "I will watch   today along with many other Rajput leaders and see what is exactly shown in it and then brief people about the movie," Sisodia said.
