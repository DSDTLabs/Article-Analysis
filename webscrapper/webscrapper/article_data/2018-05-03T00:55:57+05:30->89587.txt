Kanyakumari: A mechanised fishing boat from Kanyakumari district with nine fishermen on board which drifted in sea due to a faulty engine was rescued by the Coast Guard and towed to Karwar fisheries harbour in Karnataka, on Tuesday night. Fisheries officials in Kanyakumari told TOI that the boat St Mary’s belonging to Rejin of Thoothoor is registered in Colachel in Kanyakumari district. It is learnt that they used to regularly operate from the Kochi fisheries harbour in Kerala, like many other mechanised boats from this region. On April 1 the boat set off from Kochi with nine men on board. “After fishing they were returning to the shore with the catch when the engine suffered a technical snag in the early hours of Tuesday, when they were about seven nautical miles from Karwar. They tried mending the faulty engine till afternoon but in vain,” he said. Since the boat was not far away from the shore they called their association in Kanyakumari, which in turn alerted the fisheries department officials. The official said that they alerted the Coast Guard in Mumbai and the fisheries officials in Karnataka and Gujarat and sought help to tow the boat to safety. The Coast Guard ship reached St Mary’s in the evening and towed it to the shore that night. On Wednesday, relatives of the fishermen in that boat set off to Karwar with an alternate engine as the one in the boat could not be repaired. Fishermen were hopeful that the boat will reach Kochi in less than a week. Fisheries officials said that another boat from district – also named St Mary’s – that got drifted near Pakistan and Oman last week following a technical snag is expected to reach Kanyakumari this weekend.
