MEERUT: A day after the Bhartiya Janata party (BJP) announced a list of   for the upcoming   elections, leaders who were denied a ticket have come out against the party’s selection process. The selection process includes a survey which is carried out within the party itself.
 
  Maninder Pal Singh, who recently joined BJP from SP, was expecting a ticket from Sivalkhas. But the same went to Jitendra Satwai, who is said to a close aide of Satyapal Singh, the sitting MP from Baghpat (the   consituency Sivalkhas is part of). Angry supporters of Maninder burnt an effigy of Satyapal in Meerut on Tuesday.
  
  “I was leading in all the internal surveys of the party. The candidate who has been given the ticket is not a strong candidate. He is set to lose the seat. I will speak with my supporters and decide a future course of action based on that. But, before that, I will definitely write to   and express my displeasure at being denied a ticket despite working so hard in the region for the party”, said Maninder.
  
  Similarly, Gopal Kali, who was expecting to be fielded from Hastinapur, lost out to Dinesh Khatik. “The party claims that the internal survey is how they decide who gets the ticket. I was leading in all surveys and the ticket has gone to someone whose name wasn’t even there in the surveys. I have called a Swabhiman Rally on January 20 in my own capacity and not as a BJP member. Further course of action will be decided soon if the party doesn’t reconsider their decision,” added Kali.
