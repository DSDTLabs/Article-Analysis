NAVI MUMBAI: Think magnetic sensors to control traffic or an eco-housing model with automatic garbage segregation chambers. You may consider using padded barricades along congested roads to check noise pollution, generating cheap power from Mimosa plants or purifying effluent water for potable supply. 

 All these and other interesting model-based projects fit for a smart city were presented by students of CBSE schools from Maharashtra and Goa in the CBSE Regional  , held at the New Horizon Public school in Airoli.
 
 The theme for the three-day exhibition, that ended on Saturday, was “Science, Technology and Mathematics for Nation Building”. It had 132 exhibits from 74 schools. Using innovative, cheap or easily available resources, the students displayed ways to solve typical civic problems related to roads, traffic, power, water supply and fresh food produce. 
 
 “We have tried out a low-cost method to cover potholes in our locality and found that the use of plastic resins is quite effective for congested city roads,” said Class 10 students, Achal Agarwal and Avani Ashtaputre from Nath Valley School, Aurangabad.
 
 Other projects included generating electricity from Mimosa plants by New Horizon Public school. The team from Jaipuriar School, Sanpada showed how padded barricading of congested roads can check noise pollution. The smart eco-housing project was put up by S B Patil Public school, Pune and the Nanded-based Horizon Discovery Academy team showed magnetic sensors to control traffic snarls. Two teams from each school took part and the winners will participate in the national-level meet.
 
 The principal of New Horizon School,   said, “This exhibition provides a forum for children to pursue their natural creativity, inventiveness and innovative spirit.”
