NAGPUR: With the   barely a month ahead, the   party will be attempting a last-ditch effort to forge some sort of unity or patch-up between its leaders to ensure a face-saving performance in the civic elections. 

 The party has deputed senior leader and Rajya Sabha member   to do the firefighting and hold talks with all faction leaders. He will be in the city on January 21 and 22. City Congress president Vikas Thakre said Dalwai will be meeting party leaders of the six Assembly constituencies separately and also evaluate the proposed alliance with the Lokmanch.
 
 The Congress factions led by ex-ministers Satish Chaturvedi, Nitin Raut and Anees Ahmed are at daggers-drawn with Thakre and his mentor, ex-MP Vilas Muttemwar. These groups hold the grouse that Muttemwar and Thakre are too dominating and not giving any space to others. The various factions now want to have a say in ticket distribution at least in their respective constituencies.
 
 Thakre said talks were on with the Lokmanch and   leaders. “ Local NCP leaders approached us on Thursday and expressed inclination for a pre-poll alliance. “We have also welcomed it. Seat share and other matters will be finalized soon,” said Thakre.
 
 January 27 is the opening date for filing of nominations, but chances of the Congress or for that matter even of other parties declaring their candidates’ lists looks slim. “The   screening committee will meet in Mumbai on Jan 27 to sort out the names forwarded by the city Congress. But candidates may be finalized nearer to the Feb 3 deadline for nomination filing. The delay will ensure that aspirants who fail to get ticket get little time to hop to other parties,” said a Congress source.
