BENGALURU: Chaos prevailed on the premises of Evershine English School near Srinagar, south Bengaluru, after parents of a Class IV boy took a teacher to task for allegedly slapping their son “at least six times”. The parents claimed the teacher slapped their child so hard that it left bruise marks on his cheek.

 Other parents and activists of several local organizations joined in the fracas, following which the school management apologized to the parents. The school admitted the teacher should have not hit the boy.   P, the school principal, said action will be taken against the teacher. “We apologize for what happened. We’ve directed the teacher in question to tender an apology to the parent and she did so,” Sudha said.
 
 The parents have not filed a police complaint as yet, but said they would if they are unhappy with the school’s response to the incident. “We had gone on a three-day vacation and my son returned to school on Monday,” the boy’s mother told reporters. “The teacher asked him to show his homework. My son was trying to explain that he was on a three-day holiday. The teacher lost her cool and slapped him at least six times.”
 
 The boy’s father said: “We will wait for the school management to act against the teacher. If there is no proper action, we will then file a police complaint.”
 
 
 
 
 N Venkatesh, the block education officer (south 1), said the department will conduct an investigation into the incident. 
 
 "We will issue a notice to the school authorities and direct an immediate suspension of the teacher involved in the act," Venkatesh said. "The child protection policy calls for strict action to be taken in cases of corporal punishment against students. It is not right on the part of the school to endorse such actions by teachers. We will investigate the matter further, but a notice will be issued to the school.”
