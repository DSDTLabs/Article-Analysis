Mangaluru: Walkathons to promote a cause are now passé. Thanks to an initiative of the Systematic Voters Education and Electoral Participation ( ) Committee, Dakshina Kannada district is all set to witness the first ever ‘Jalathon’ to impress the fishermen community to come out and exercise their franchise in the forthcoming polls to the state assembly. A flotilla of boats will sail down the Phalguni river shortly, carrying the message— ‘Come to the polling station’.

 Taking a cue from the geographic characteristics of this coastal district, where the sea and intertwining rivers are a part of daily life, the SVEEP committee headed by ZP CEO M R Ravi, has embarked on the idea of holding a ‘Jalathon’. Jala incidentally means water in Kannada. “We have many fishermen who reside along the banks of these rivers, and even on the shores abutting the sea,” Ravi said.
 
 “The date of this unique event, that will see a flotilla of fishing boats sail down the Phalguni with a message encouraging all stakeholders to cast their vote, will be fixed shortly,” Ravi said. The committee is looking at all possible avenues to reach out to every segment of society, that is eligible to exercise its franchise. “We may have wittingly or otherwise overlooked a few critical segments of voters in the past, and this is an attempt to cover all bases,” he said.
 
 As per the plan formulated for the ‘Jalathon’, Ravi said the Election Commission of India logo for the forthcoming elections will be supplied in the form of flags to boat owners, with a request to them to fly the same on their fishing vessels. “This will create curiosity among other fishermen, to see a non-standard flag flutter on the bow of boats, and this is precisely what we are striving to achieve in terms of creating all-round curiosity among stakeholders,” he said.
