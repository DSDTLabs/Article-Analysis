NEW DELHI: Giving a boost to the long pending demand of farmer organisations from across the country, the   high court has suggested the Centre and the state government "provide legal status to   ( ) by bringing a suitable legislation". 

 The step, if taken, will make it a legal right of farmers to get the support price for their produce.
 
 The court, while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) on redressal of farmersâ€™ grievances in the backdrop of incidents of suicides in Uttarakhand, on Thursday also directed the Centre and the state government to implement "broader recommendations" of the M S   committee on providing higher support prices on all notified crops to farmers based on comprehensive formula (C2) of calculating cost of production.
 
 The direction comes at the time when the Centre has been fine-tuning a robust mechanism to procure all notified farm produce at minimum support price (MSP)
 
 A detailed framework of the mechanism, giving different options to states, is expected to be approved by the Cabinet soon. 
 
 The Centre has, however, already made it clear that the support price would be at least one-and-a-half times more than the production cost .
