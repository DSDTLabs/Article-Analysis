Visakhapatnam: Motorists who adhere to traffic rules rarely get rewarded. But it was different on Tuesday when nearly 200 two-wheeler and four-wheeler rules-abiding drivers at Jagadamba Junction and Tech Mahindra Junction received gifts as part of the ‘Win with the Times’ campaign. The winners also collected a copy of The Times of India on the occasion.  Organised by The Times of India, the campaign is supported by the city traffic police and Vizag RTA. It would be held at various junctions in the city for the next three weeks between Monday and Friday from 8.30 am to 10 am.  Besides, those spotted with a copy of The Times of India newspaper and found complying with traffic rules are also being handed over surprise gifts by traffic cops. Appreciating the initiative, Sri Kanaka Mahalakshmi Temple chairman Wuppala Bhaskar Rao, who was one of the motorists receiving a gift, said, “It’s a good initiative. Many will become aware of the importance of traffic rules. You don’t have to give them gifts also, just thank them for following traffic rules and they will be happy. The campaign will have a positive effect on the people.” “We are definitely encouraging people to follow traffic rules. Apart from personal safety, commuters providing safety to co-riders are also rewarded. We certainly appreciate the effort to improve awareness among people,” said advocate P Ramakrishna, adding that helmets made of quality materials should be provided to motorists. Another participant Vijaya Lakshmi said, “It’s a very good initiative. After informing my family about the campaign, they are also being motivated to follow traffic rules.” The traffic cops also kept announcing in the background about safe practices to be followed while driving such as wearing helmets and seat-belts and not speaking on phone while driving
