BENGALURU: One fateful day last year, little Lakshay had slipped into   straight out of classroom. After a seven-month battle with life, on Wednesday he walked back to   at  . 

 To the surprise and relief of his parents, the six-year-old neither cried nor hesitated while leaving home and joining his classmates whom he had last seen before slipping into coma.
 
 On June 10, Lakshay hurt his middle and ring fingers while playing at his desk in school. The boy was rushed to a city hospital, where his parents were told that he’d require a surgery. However, the boy slipped into coma soon after he was administered  . Subsequently, he was put on a ventilator.
 
 Due to alleged medical negligence, the UKG student has gone back on several of his milestones, his father Purushotam BS told TOI. “We thought it best to let him mingle with kids of his age in the hope that he would improve. As of now, his recovery is 70% and he walks like a one- or two-year-old,” he said.
 
 GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE PRAYERS
 
 If he stayed home longer, he wouldn’t be able to interact with others. At least this way he’ll get back to what’s being taught at school. We are grateful to everyone for their prayers which helped him recover
