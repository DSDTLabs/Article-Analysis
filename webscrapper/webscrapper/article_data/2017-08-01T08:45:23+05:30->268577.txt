LUCKNOW: Taking a jibe at BJP national president Amit Shah’s statement that the erstwhile Samajwadi Party government’s development claims comprise half-finished projects like Lucknow Agra   and Lucknow Metro, former chief minister   Yadav said on Monday evening that the distance between Lucknow and Noida can now be covered in five hours, faster than on the Shatabdi superfast train, thanks to the expressway. He went on to question the   government about its promise of starting a bullet train.

 Earlier, during his media interaction, Shah had said that the Yogi government had been formed only three months bacj and one should not expect big development projects to be completed in such a short span of time. In response to the media query on whether Yogi government will be able to match Akhilesh’s development projects like Agra Expressway and Lucknow Metro train, completed in record time, Shah shot back: “Have you boarded the metro with your family? We don’t believe in inaugurating unfinished projects.”
 
 Later, Akhilesh tweeted, questioning Center about the route of the proposed Bullet train in UP. In a press statement released later in the day, Akhilesh said the Agra expressway was completed in 22 months and though the Modi government at Center has been in power for three years now, they cannot name a single similar project that is complete.
 
 Akhilesh also described Amit Shah’s lunch at the residence of a booth level party worker Sonu Yadav as merely a photo-op to further the BJP’s agenda of caste politics.
