DEHRADUN: The residents of   have complained that roads dug up to lay sewer lines in the area have increased travel time and made the ride a difficult one for commuters. The road was dug up by jal sansthan a few days ago to lay sewer lines. Residents said that the work was not well-planned and no space has been left on the side of the road for pedestrians.
 
   , a resident of Nehru Colony, said, “We were not given advance notice that a sewer line was going to be laid. I understand that this is development work but the authorities could have planned better and left one side of the road untouched.”
  
  The authorities, however, said that laying of a sewer line requires the entire road to be dug up. S K Sharma, a jal sansthan official told TOI, “The work on the road had to be carried out although it will cause some inconvenience to the residents. The workers have been told to be careful while dealing with heavy machinery.”
  
  The residents said that the roads in their colony were already narrow and since work has started on them, there is not enough space to drive smoothly.
  
  Resident   said, “The streets here are narrow and now there is not enough space to drive four-wheelers on the road. Also, no sign boards have been placed at the project site.”
  
   , another resident, said, “Today morning I discovered a mound of mud outside the gate of my house. I could not even take my scooter out because the path was totally blocked.”
  
   , councillor of Nehru Colony, said that the project would take two months to finish. “The ward, which has a population of approximately 8,000, has narrow roads with houses on either side which has compounded the problem,” Bhatt said.
