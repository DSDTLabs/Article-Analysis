HYDERABAD:The   rail stretch between Ameerpet and Hi-Tec City will be ready for inauguration by October this year. The stretch falls under corridor III, Nagole to Shilparamam, but only part of the corridor up to Ameerpet was completed earlier. In November, the stretch from Nagole to Miyapur via Ameerpet was inaugurated.

 Ridership on the stretch was not encouraging as the crucial link from Ameerpet to Hi-Tec City (Shilparamam) could not be completed due to land acquisition issues. “Land and property acquisition on Ameerept and Hi-Tec City stretch are now completed. We demolished properties to erect the viaduct in Yousufugda,” HMRL managing director NVS Reddy told TOI.
 
 Senior officials said civil and design works, electrical and signalling works at Cyber Towers and Shilparamam entry and exit works at Durgam Cheruvuu station have not been completed yet.
 
 “We are facing problems in train frequency as communication-based control hasn’t been completed between Mettuguda and Begumpet. We are running them on conventional signal system. We do not want this to repeat on Ameerpet_Hi-tec City route,” Reddy emphasised, adding that all issues are being solved on priority basis.
