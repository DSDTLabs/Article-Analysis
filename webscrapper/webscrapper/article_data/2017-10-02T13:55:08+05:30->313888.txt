Jaipur: The state   has decided to expedite the purchase of land for the party district units so that construction of party offices could begin simultaneously in all the districts.

 At a review meeting held the other day, it was said that in 28 districts, land for the office has already been purchased and in the remaining districts also land is being finalized for party office. Sources said the party wants to speed up the construction of the offices considering that that assembly election is just a year away.
