Actor Govind Padmasoorya (GP) is thrilled that he is making inroads into Tamil industry. However, he isn’t playing it safe or sticking to conventional characters in his Kollywood debut. He plays the villain in his debut movie  , a tech thriller, directed by debutant filmmaker  . 

 “It’s one of my intense characters so far, both plot-wise and looks-wise,” says GP who has just wrapped up a schedule of the film in Pondicherry. 
 
 “I play the anti-hero Shiva, and he is an urban, sophisticated, strong yet calm fellow. Even my look in the film is a tad rough. My thick beard and mane are designed to make him look an unconventional baddie,” GP says. As the Tamil used in the film is quite urban in nature, the actor says that didn’t pose much of a challenge.
 
 The movie also has South Indian actors  ,  ,   and RJ Balaji in important roles. Interestingly, in the schedules that are just over, he hardly had any scenes with other actors. “It has to do with the unique nature of the plot. In the upcoming schedules, I do have quite a few combination scenes with Jeeva,” he says.
 
 So what does Kee mean? GP says, “It just means key.” The film has Pondicherry, Chennai and Hyderabad as its main locations.
