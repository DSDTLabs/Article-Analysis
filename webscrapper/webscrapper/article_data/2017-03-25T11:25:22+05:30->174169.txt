ALLAHABAD: Activists of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen ( ) have accused Yogi-led state government of terrorising small licensed chicken and goat meat sellers on the pretext of tightening the noose around unlicensed slaughter houses. 

 Mahanagar AIMIM president Afsar Mahmood said traders with valid licences are facing hardship in their business and there was none to hear their grievances. He added those who apply for licence from   (AMC) were not being entertained by officials concerned and even the police target meat shops.
 
 Mahmood claimed that a team of policemen raided licensed meat shops in Kareli and seized chicken and mutton. He alleged that the state government was involved in harassing a particular community. As a result, fear psychosis has gripped the people. 
 
 AIMIM leaders alleged that there was no check on the sale of fish. Illegal fish markets are thriving at Wasiyabad, Moti Mahal, AG office road and Naini bridge. 
 
 They claimed that hundreds of people have become unemployed after the closure of Atala slaughter house. AIMIM members warned to launch a massive agitation across the state government if the problems of valid and licensed meat shop owners were not heard. 
 
 The prices of chicken and mutton too have gone up in markets.
