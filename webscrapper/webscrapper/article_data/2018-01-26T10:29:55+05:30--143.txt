VELLORE: The   of 16 year-old   have exposed serious lapses and mismanagement of funds to the tune of Rs 35.91crore. It also revealed that university authorities have miserably failed to maintain a registry of its assets and investments since the university was established in the year 2002.

 The audit reports of the university accessed by TOI showed that the Directorate Local Fund Audit (DLFA) raised 499 objections between 2002-2003 and 2014-2015 relating to activities and purchases worth Rs 35.91 crore. Of this, the   raised objections to 45 subjects that amounted to Rs 11.39crore in 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 and 53 objections to a sum of Rs 13.02crore spent during 2012-2013.
 
 In the 2011-2012 audit report, an objection was raised for procuring equipment, stationaries and other items worth Rs 1.27crore between May 6, 2011 and December 12, 2011 without floating tenders. The university is yet to submit its reply to set right the audit objection.
 
 When contacted, Thiruvalluvar University vice-chancellor   said they will rectify all the objections in the forthcoming joint sitting with the DLFA. He, however, refused to speak further.
 
 Without floating tender, the university should not procure equipment or any materials above Rs 20,000. It is a clear violation of the provisions of the   Transparency in Tenders Act 1998 and its rules, retired professor and former syndicate member of the university I   told TOI.
 
 The university had also failed to submit 13 registers during the audit conducted for the year 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. This included ‘cheques/DD received’ register (all departments), building register (all departments), asset register, vehicle register, tender register, information act – applications, action files and registers, all grants received registers and names of consolidated staff members’ register.
 
 Citing the rule 11 (9) of Thiruvalluvar University Act 2002, the DLFA said the annual physical verification of university properties should be conducted. But it was not done for the last 15 years.
 
 The DLFA, in its closure report of the final audit for the year 2014-2015, stated that the university authorities had failed to maintain “a consolidated stock register of materials, equipment, tools and plants kept by various departments” and also failed to watch over the stocks.
 
 Sources said the university, as per government order, should maintain asset register in a prescribed format for all capital purchases and buildings constructed from all the grants, including University Grant Commission.
 
 “No register is maintained regarding the purchases made from grants received by the university. Though the non-adherence of government guideline was brought to the notice of the officials in all the 16 audit annual reports, no action has been taken by the authorities to make clear the audit objection. It reveals that they are indulging in malpractices to pocket several crores of rupees,” said Elangovan, who is also the honorary president of the Thiruvalluvar University Employees’ Association. 
 
 The university officials neither submitted its annual audit report to the higher education secretary nor tabled it in the legislative assembly for scrutiny. It is a flagrant violation of the university act. “Not a single report has been forwarded to the government or the assembly,” added the retired professor and demanded that the Tamil Nadu Governor, who is the chancellor of the universities, constitute an inquiry committee under section 10 of the University Act to probe the malpractices to the tune of several crores of rupees.
 
 He also demanded that the higher education secretary take necessary action as per the provision of section 8 of the university act.
