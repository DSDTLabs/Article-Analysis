GREATER NP: Supreme Court judge Justice   on Saturday said the ‘law man’ plays an active role in guiding the nation and creating a society which adheres to law. Exhorting budding lawyers to have a vision and mission in life, he said the society expects a lot from them as they know what their country is.

 Justice Kurian was delivering the inaugural lecture of a moot court competition and law students’ conference in a private college in   area of   on Saturday.
 
 Addressing the audience that included professors, publishers, senior advocates, and students from across the SAARC countries, Justice Kurian said the world is now a small village and the ‘law man’ being a part of it must lead the world forward. To the young students present for the competition, he said that law teaches how to live, and it is for everyone. But those few who feel are above it create a lot of problems for the nation. Recalling the lawmakers of the country, he said that they had a vision and a mission and they faced many problems but never lost faith in their vision and mission. Similarly, the young lawyers of each country must have a mission to take the society forward. He added that only the practitioners of law can take the society ahead.
 
 “Law is nothing but the mirror of life. It is the science of your own existence in the nation. You learn the Constitution of the country. All who know how to practise law... those who know the way of law know how to lead others in the path of law,” he said 
 
 Asking the students to apply the rules of law in their lives, he said having rules in life leads one to have order in life. “Order will keep you protected and guide you and will help constitute the nation ultimately,” he said.
