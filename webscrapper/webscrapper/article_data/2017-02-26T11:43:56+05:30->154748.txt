GAYA: As the earlier plan for power generation through municipal waste has not   of its economic non-viability, the   (GMC) is considering an alternative decentralized   plan and the services of a Udaipur-based consultant is likely to be requisitioned to make it a reality. 

 Sources said 250 tonnes of   is produced daily in the 53 Gaya wards. But the waste is not enough for power generation purpose for reasons of economic non-viability.
 
 Municipal commissioner Vijay Kumar said decentralized waste management, a success story in different cities, including Udaipur (Rajasthan), is being considered and the consultant would be invited for presentation before different stakeholders.
 
 As per the decentralized process, clusters are formed comprising several wards of the municipal body as waste collection centres. The waste is collected by women self-help groups using tricycles for a separate door level collection of wet and dry waste. Each household is required to deposit waste in two separate dustbins. For every 100 households, one SHG member is authorized to collect waste and houseowners have to make a monthly payment of Rs30.
 
 Cows and poultry are maintained at these collection centres. Vegetable wastes remain fit for cattle feed for at least 24 hours. Besides producing cattle and poultry feed, the waste would also be used for compost production. Milk, eggs and compost produced at these centres would be sold in the market to generate additional resources for the maintenance of these centres. Such waste management would also be biofriendly, claimed the municipal commissioner.
 
 Conceding that positive public cooperation was a must for the success of the decentralized waste management plan, Vijay said an awareness campaign was required to make it a success and use of separate dustbins for dry and wet waste has to be popularized.
