TRICHY: Naam Tamilar Katchi has alleged that the ground water at   in Thanjavur district was found to be contaminated following the oil and gas extraction work being carried out by ONGC for the last 15 years. ONGC and the state government have been claiming that the extraction work was in no way harmful to fertile land and would not affect the livelihood of the residents.

 Party leader Seeman produced the report of a clinical test claimed to have been conducted by a private agency on the ground water sample taken from the village. It showed that several values of the sample were high ruling the water unfit for drinking and agriculture purposes. Seeman said that the odour, turbidity, total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen in the water were all changed indicating contamination. 
 
 “The test clearly shows that the contamination and oil content in water are too high. The state government should take steps for the immediate withdrawal of the Oil and   for the welfare of the general public in the village”, he said while briefing reporters here.
 
 Meanwhile, protests against ONGC continued at Kathiramangalam on Tuesday too with residents staging a novel protest by cooking and eating at the venue. Over 3,000 shops were closed in   and adjacent towns in support of Kathiramangalam residents. State president of Manithaneya Makkal Katchi Jawahirullah also stressed the need for vacating ONGC from Kathiramangalam to safeguard people and their agriculture lands.
