HYDERABAD: The 18-year-old  , Nikhil, is critically ill at the  . The zoo currently houses 22 Royal  . 

  It may be recalled Nikhil's sibling Sakhi was killed, skinned and hanged from a tree at the zoo in 2000 by three miscreants who had sneaked into the zoo to carry out the gruesome murder of Sakhi. They were finally arrested by city police in 2005. 
 
 Nikhil, who went on to become a favourite of visitors at the zoological park, has been unable to eat or even stand up for the past over one week. 
 
 The tiger is currently in the intensive care and his condition is being monitored by consultant Dr M  , retired deputy director of the zoo. Nikhil has been suffering from bronchopneumonia for the last two months and had stopped eating for quite some time. 
 
 While zoo authorities have consulted veterinary specialists, the tiger, who is at the fag end of his life, has not improved. 
 
 "In general, tigers in the wild usually live up to 15 years but in captivity they can often live up to even 20 years. Nikhil has already surpassed his life span. Now, we are trying to extend it by providing more treatment. However, due to old age, he has stopped taking food," said Dr.  , veterinary assistant director at the zoo.
