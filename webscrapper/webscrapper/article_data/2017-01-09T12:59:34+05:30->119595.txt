Hollywood actress   went all gutsy at the 2017 Golden Globe Awards! Not only did she sport unruly armpits, but also wore a rather interesting brooch to the red carpet of the gala event.
 
  
 
  
  The Gone Girl actress wore an elegant strapless floral gown and looked pretty as a picture but people could not help but overlook her unshaven pits.
  
  Interestingly, this is not the first time the actress has been spotted flaunting the dark wisps of her armpit hair. Lola hit headlines back in 2015, when she bared her unshaved underarms for a Vanity Fair magazine shoot.
  
  
 
  
  Well, if the unshaved look wasn’t enough, the actress also sported a ‘F*** You Paul Ryan’ brooch, showing her discontent about House Speaker Paul Ryan’s suggestion to defund planned parenthood in America.
  
  
 
  
  Well, that’s a rather bold style statement for the Golden Globes, which are only second to Oscars. We are already wondering what the actress plans to wear for the Oscar red carpet?
