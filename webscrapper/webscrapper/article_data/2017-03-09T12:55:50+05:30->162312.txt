BHOPAL: Opposition Congress raised issue of sand miners being forced to pay ‘gunda tax’ on border area of Chambal and Uttar Pradesh in the assembly, on Wednesday. The Congress alleged that it was happening with connivance of local police with sand mafia and extortionists. 

 Demanding action in the House during call attention motion, Congress MLA from Lahar (Bhind), Govind Singh said mafia in Uttar Pradesh killed one Rakesh Rajawat, a resident of Hirapur village, on January 14 and looted Rs 45,000 and a tractor, 35 km from Lahar. A complaint was lodged with Umri police, but the main accused is still at large.
 
 “Police did not arrest the main culprit since last two months while officials were trying to shield him. The mafia extorts Rs 1,000 from truckers and tractor owners as gunda tax at UP border. A part of the extortion money goes to the police, too,” alleged Govind Singh.
 
 Replying to the issue, state home minister Bhupendra Singh warned that the strict action would be taken against those involved in illegal   and criminal activities in Chambal region, bordering Uttar Pradesh. He said the government would also investigate involvement and role of police officials in the area.
 
 “It is a serious matter. Three pepole were arrested in Rajawat kiling case. The main accused, Jitendra Singh, is at large and police are trying to arrest him at the earliest. We will also form a team headed by additional SP to investigate the matter and involvement of local police staff,” the minister told the House.
 
 He stated the government would raise reward money on head of the main accused to Rs 25,000 from Rs 10,000 as announced earlier.
 
 The minister clarified police were keeping a check on activities like illegal mining and extortion in the area. However, a few cases are reported and instructions have been issued for immediate action in this regard, Singh said.
