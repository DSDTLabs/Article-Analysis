Revenge is a dish best served cold”, goes the tagline of Keshava, but   believes “success is a dish best enjoyed sweet”. “Even after a week since   released, every theater is going housefull, which is crazy. ,” says the actor who’s travelling across   and  , promoting the film along with his co-star  . “The film has struck a chord with audiences across age groups. Both 60-plus folk and school kids under the age of 10 are loving the film. The whole unit has been pleasantly surprised with the way the public are cheering for the film. We have been clicking selfies everywhere and posting them online,” he adds excitedly. 

 How a college student, Keshav, who suffers from a rare heart condition that makes him vulnerable to even a slight rise in blood pressure, plots to kill those responsible for destroying his family, is the crux of this off-beat revenge drama. The film’s success is a vindication of the actor’s decision to stick to off-beat subjects. “When you do something different and that hits the bullseye at the BO, its fills you with pride. I would say Keshava is one of the most satisfying hits of my career. It was one of the most challenging roles in my career. It has given me a new dimension as an actor,” elaborates Nikhil adding, “I’ve been consciously trying to re-invent myself with every film and thankfully all my experiments have been successful since  .” 
 
 His success mantra is simple: “It’s the element of surprise that is working for me. When they walk out of the theater the audience must feel that they saw something new. That’s what gives me my kicks,” says Nikhil signing off. Keshava, produced by Abhishek Nama on Abhishek Pictures, is running in theaters.
