MUMBAI: The   on Thursday received its first brand new   with air-conditioned (AC) driver's cabin. The train has been kept at the Kurla car shed and will be commissioned soon. 

 The train has   in all  . There are five ladies compartments (partial and full) and there are 6 to 8 CCTV cameras in each coach, said CR chief spokesperson Sunil Udasi.
 
 “It is the first such   rake in the suburban section of Mumbai division wherein the driver's cabin—at both ends—are air-conditioned,” he said. The Western Railway was the first to launch a complete AC local between Churchgate and Virar stations recently.
 
 Although the CR did not get an AC train, it has now received the latest Bombardier train from ICF, Chennai, which is partially AC (driver cabins), said an official. “We expect to get 11 more trains with AC in driver cabin and CCTV cameras installed for women’s security at factory itself,” the official added.
 
 Sources said that in the previous rakes, the railways had installed the CCTV cameras based on need and specifications. The CR, for example, fitted cameras in 50 coaches at its city workshops. "But this time, the ICF has sent a rake already factory-fitted with the surveillance cameras and they are in very good condition,'' said an official.
 
 The new Bombardier rake is now in addition to five others which were given by WR to the CR in the past few months. The rake is fitted with LED lights in all coaches, has good leg space, stainless steel seats provided instead of polycarbonate seats, and all fans have stainless steel mesh (cover). "The overall interior of the newly received rake is much better than the earlier ones,” Udasi added.
