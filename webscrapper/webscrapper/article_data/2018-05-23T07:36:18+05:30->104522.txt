PUNE: To make the intense   a bit more tolerable, the state   authority has come out with a series of measures to combat heatwave conditions in different cities.

 The measures — which will be a part of the state’s heat action plan — include changing school timings to shield children from the scorching afternoon heat, keeping parks and temples open for people seeking shelter and police personnel above the age of 45 being spared from noon shifts.
 
 
  
 
 An official from the state disaster management authority said the draft heat action plan will be used by all the cities as a base document to prepare their own plans. The district authorities will determine the temperature threshold for issuing “Red” and “Orange” alerts, indicative of “extreme heat alert day” and “heat alert day” respectively while preparing the heat action plan. “Few of the steps that will have to be adhered to for mitigating the effects of a heatwave will include water stations at different places, altering school timings and ensuring that schools close for summer holidays by April 15 every year,” the official said.
 
 People working outdoors such as police personnel, autorickshaw drivers, porters, beggars, worksite and agricultural labourers need more water during the afternoon. “Drinking water spots will have to be created for such people with the support of social organizations. Instructions have been given to the district collectors,” he said. Other measures include providing shelter to traffic personnel on duty and changing the duty hours of the high-risk age groups among the traffic cops.
