Six-part drama series "All That Glitters", the story of the rivalry between former Vanity Fair and New Yorker editor   and Vogue chief  , will not move forward at Bravo.

 The NBC Universal-owned cable network has abandoned plans for the series.
 
 The project from Universal Cable Productions and executive producers Gale Anne Hurd and Judith Verno had been ordered to series in May.
 
 Bravo did not specify a reason for axing the show, reported Deadline.
 
 "All That Glitters" was the true story of the behind- the-scenes rivalry, relationship, and remarkable ascent of Vogue editor Wintour and Vanity Fair/New Yorker editor Brown.
 
 Based on the Thomas Maier book Newhouse, the six-hour series was written and executive produced by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal, with Maier as producer.
