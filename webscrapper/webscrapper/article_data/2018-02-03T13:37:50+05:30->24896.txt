UDHAGAMANDALAM:   out in Mudumalai   (MTR) in the Nilgiris on Friday, destroying a large extent of forest land. It took several hours for forest guards and watchers of MTR to bring the flames under control.

 The fire broke out near Kakkanallah check post around 8am and spread quickly to the reserve forest area, forest officials said. “Nearly three hectares of forest land was destroyed in the incident. Due to winter, grass had become very dry. Someone might have left a cigarette butt near Kakkanallah check post, causing the fire,” said V A Saravanan, deputy director, MTR.
 
 When alerted, forest guards immediately sprang into action and doused the fire after three hours of struggle.
