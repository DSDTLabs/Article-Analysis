CHENNAI: AIADMK ( ) faction leader   has offered to 'gift-deed' the 18-cent patta land with the well to villagers of   near Periyakulam, provided they come forward to buy a 40-acre coconut farm being irrigated with water from it. 

 He has offered villagers three months' time to complete the purchase formalities, failing which he retains the right to sell the same to any third party, he told a meeting with village elders, held at the   in Theni on Thursday evening. The meeting was held in the presence of government revenue officials among others, said Chinnaswamy, an OPS supporter from Lakshmipuram village. "Without the well, there is no way the coconut farm can be maintained and irrigated," Chinnaswamy, who attended the meeting, said.
 
 Even though OPS did not hint at any particular price for the farm, the general understanding is that the sale can happen at the prevailing market price. The going rate is said to be 25 lakh per acre for coconut farms in the region. 
 
 The 40-acre coconut farm and a 18-cent land parcel, in which the well is located, are owned by Panneerselvam's wife Vijayalakshmi. With the village facing a drinking water shortage, the villagers had come up with an unusual demand asking Vijayalakshmi to either gift deed or sell the land parcel with the well to the village. This unusual demand was seen by OPS faction to have political undercurrents, especially due to the on-going feud within AIADMK. The neighbouring assembly segments are represented by supporters of T T V Dinakaran. Initial attempts to resolve the issue through a peace committee had failed.
 
 The proceedings of the meetings were documented and signed by representatives from both sides. In the interim three months, Vijayalakshmi had agreed to permit the villagers to draw the required water for their household needs.
