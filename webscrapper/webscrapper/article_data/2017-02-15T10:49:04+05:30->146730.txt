AHMEDABAD: A team of city police’s special operations group (SOG) nabbed a Kadi resident on Monday for forging three passports and sending three persons from three different families to Canada each using the details of a Mumbai-based family. Police have started a search for other accused in the case.

 B C Solanki, ACP (SOG), said they received a complaint from   (FRRO) of the bureau of immigration about the misuse of a passport from Ahmedabad international airport where three people travelled to Montreal, Canada, in August, September and October last year on the same three passports.
 
 “The passports belonged to a Memon family based in Mumbai. The family included a couple in their late thirties and a child of about six years of age. In all the instances, the   tickets to Canada were bought by a travel agent in Bapunagar. When we investigated the travel firm owner, we learned the tickets were booked by Bipinchandra Patel alias Bakabhai, a resident of Kadi, Mehsana,” said Solanki.
 
 Patel was apprehended and questioned when he confessed to having sent three families - two from Kalol in Gandhinagar and one from Ranip in Ahmedabad — using the passport details of the Memon family. He got the passport details from a Mumbai-based agent.
