PUDUCHERRY: The tussle between the   government headed by chief minister V Narayansamy and lieutenant governor   over the nomination of BJP MLAs has now shifted to New Delhi as the two national parties strive to emerge victorious and gain advantage ahead of next year’s Lok Sabha polls. 

 The visit of the leader of opposition   to New Delhi following BJP president Amit Shah’s invitation at this juncture was largely seen as the saffron party’s move to destabilise the Congress government, which needed the support of its ally and an independent candidate for a simple majority in the 30-member legislative assembly in the Union territory.
 
 Rangasamy, who left   early on Thursday, met Shah in New Delhi and reportedly briefed him on the prevailing political scenario in the backdrop of the Congress government refusing to recognise the nomination of BJP MLAs by the Union government, despite Madras high court orders. Two of the three BJP MLAs had also met the party’s top brass and narrated the humiliation they suffered at the hands of the ruling government.
 
 Earlier, chief minister  , his cabinet colleague A Namassivayam and his parliamentary secretary K Lakshminarayanan, who left for New Delhi on Wednesday met Congress president Rahul Gandhi and senior Congress leaders and briefed them on the developments over the nominated MLAs issue and sought guidance on safeguarding the ‘rights of the elected government’, challenged by the lt governor. 
 
 The Puducherry legislative assembly on March 26 passed a resolution seeking to implead itself in the petition filed by Lakshminarayanan before the Supreme Court challenging the Madras high court order upholding the nomination of three BJP MLAs. 
 
 The Union government in June last year nominated Puducherry BJP unit president V Saminathan, treasurer K G Shankar and BJP loyalist S Selvaganapathy as members of the legislative assembly without consulting the Congress government. Bedi administered them the oath of office and secrecy at Raj Nivas without intimating the ruling government .
