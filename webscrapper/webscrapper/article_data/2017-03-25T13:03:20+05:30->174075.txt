Porvorim: There is   who missed the government’s one time settlement ( ) scheme, with the   on Friday announcing its decision to review the scheme.

 Chief minister  , in his budget 2017-18 speech, said that he has been receiving requests from the various sectors that missed out on the benefits of the OTS scheme “for one or the other technical reason” and that his government would “review the matter and take appropriate decision on the merit of such cases”. 
 
 The scheme was aimed at benefiting those affected by the mining ban that was effective in the state from 2012 to 2015.
 
 Parrikar said he had brought the sale of mineral ore under Schedule ‘G’ of the Goa VAT Act, 2005, whereby Input Tax Credit was not made applicable to the sale of mineral ore. 
 
 “Considering the current position, where there is an effective monitoring and regulatory framework in place for mineral ore sales and export, I propose to allow Input Tax Credit on sale of mineral ore by omitting this entry from Schedule ‘G’,” he added. Sources in the mining industry explained that essentially VAT on ore for export needs to be refundable and inputs credit to be provided on all sale of ore in the course of exports. 
 
 By this correction the purchaser can claim for inputs credit, which was made non-applicable in 2012. The right correction has taken place, sources in the mining industry stated.
