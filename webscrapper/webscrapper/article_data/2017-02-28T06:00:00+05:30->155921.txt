KOLKATA: With its operating ratio hovering around 260,   has been asked by minister of state for railways   to explore all possibilities to raise   at the stations. As part of this initiative,   will become operational at six stations from Tuesday.

 The minister visited the   headquarters on Monday and urged officials to carry out a detailed survey at stations to exploit display space to the maximum.
 
  “The minister said that we should also explore the possibility of letting out space for chemist shops and other outlets, even vehicle showrooms. At some stations, we do have sufficient floor space available for two- and four-wheeler showrooms. We have already started letting out space at stations. From Tuesday, Ola kiosks will become operational at Esplanade, Rabindra Sadan, Park Street, Rabindra Sarobar, Kalighat and Mahanayak Uttam Kumar stations. Representatives of the company will be present at these kiosks to assist passengers, particularly those who don’t use smart phones, in getting cabs,” said Metro Railway CPRO Indrani Banerjee.
