THANE: With   now coming under the spotlight in terms of their safety and security provisions following the murder of the seven-year-old student of a  , teachers, academicians and staff in these schools are handling   who are in a state of fear and panic.

 School teachers and principals are now handling calls from   parents, upgrading their security measures and also trying to discipline children whilst ensuring that they are not extremely upset and unstable. Their key job role seems to have shifted from providing education to keeping a tab on each child’s movement within the school, thus leaving them in a stressful mess.
 
 “Even though our security systems are in place, teachers are are in a state of pressure to make sure that the kids are safe when in school,” said Rupa Dey, principal of  .
 
 “Even though we have security guards, CCTVs and separate washrooms we are re-evaluating and adding new provisions after every incident in any school. Today, we not only started a buddy system where children have to go to the washroom in pairs, but also have kept one peon per floor to monitor suspicious activities. We also are re conducting good touch and bad touch sessions,” she added.
 
 Many schools are organising counselling for teachers. “Every teacher is stressed, which can affect the way they teach. Teachers need to be calm and composed despite all these crucial responsibilities, which is why we have started weekly counselling sessions for them to detox mentally,” said Meenakshi Iyer, principal of Sri Ma Vidyalaya.
