NEW DELHI: Passengers at   who paid the steep user development fee (UDF) while buying tickets after July 7 will know next week if they will get a   for the excess payment. The charge was drastically slashed on Friday.

 B S Bhullar, chief of Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( ), told TOI that the issue had been flagged by some agencies, including IGI Airport. “We will talk to the aviation ministry, Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) and other stakeholders next week. A decision will be taken after the meetings,” he said. Some airline portals are still charging the old rates as bringing the new ones in their system may take a couple of days.
 
 In a passenger-friendly move, the government has abolished UDF for incoming flyers at IGI that, before July 7, was between Rs 462 and Rs 933 for a flyer coming from abroad and between Rs 207 and Rs 415 for a domestic passenger. 
 
 The UDF for a passenger going abroad — which was between Rs 566 and Rs 1,131 — has been slashed to Rs 45. Similarly, the rates for domestic outbound flyer was between Rs 245 and Rs 490, and has now become only Rs 10. The slabs of the departing UDF that was earlier linked to distance flown has been made a flat rate. 
 
 Hence, the UDF on a ticket for a Delhi-Paris/San Francisco-Delhi flight would have earlier been Rs 2,436 (with 18% tax on the old departing and arriving UDF of Rs 1,131 + Rs 933). But it has come down to Rs 54 (Rs 45 outbound UDF with 18% tax and no arrival charge). This person has, therefore, paid Rs 2,383 more than the current rates.
 
 Similarly, a person who booked a Delhi-Chennai-Delhi tickets at old UDF rates for travel after July 7 paid Rs 1,068 (with 18% tax on old departing and arriving UDF of Rs 490 and Rs 415) while the UDF now would be just Rs 12 (with 18% tax on Rs 10 outbound UDF and no arrival charge). This person would have paid Rs 1,056 more.
 
 For persons travelling in a group, say a family, the excess amount gets multiplied by the number of flyers. People buy air tickets months in advance for planned travel to get the lowest rates. 
 
 If a refund is not possible due to logistical reasons, this money can go to IGI Airport and then be adjusted by AERA against the airport’s future infrastructure requirement for expansion through something known as truing-up mechanism.
