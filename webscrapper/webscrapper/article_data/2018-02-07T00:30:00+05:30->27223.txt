Bengaluru: The government has set a 42-month deadline to complete the Metro link to the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), a project whose implementation has been marred by delays. Answering a question in the assembly on Tuesday, Bengaluru development minister KJ George said no funds for the said stretch had been utilized till now. In fact, the government approved the route alignment in late 2017. Citizen groups and activists have been opposing the route, claiming it would take away a playground and a heritage structure in Pottery Town. The 29-km Nagawara-KIA link will eventually connect Gottigere to the airport. The government plans to construct a 21-km stretch between Gottigere and Nagawara, which will have 13.7-km underground stretch and traverse the heart of the city. Apart from state government funds, the project will also receive funds from the Centre.  In his budget for 2018-19, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the overall Bengaluru Metro rail project will get a chunk of the Rs 15,000 crore earmarked for all Metro projects in the country.
