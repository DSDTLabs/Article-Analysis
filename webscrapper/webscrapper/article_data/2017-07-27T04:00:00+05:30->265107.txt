Ahmedabad: A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced compensation of Rs 2 lakh for flood victims, the state government on Wednesday declared that it would pay Rs 4 lakh ex gratia to the kin of the deceased.

 On late Wednesday evening, chief minister Vijay Rupani announced that the state government would pay the compensation in addition to the Rs 2 lakh to be paid from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF). So far, 119 deaths have been reported from across the state since monsoon began.
 
 During his Gujarat visit to survey the flood situation, Modi had announced interim relief of Rs 500 crore. This includes compensation for deaths, damage caused to crops, and the loss of livestock.
 
 Rupani’s office has announced that the distribution of fodder will take place in flood-devastated districts of Banaskantha and Patan. Some 150 teams of surveyors will be deployed to undertake a survey of loss of livestock within four days in both districts of North Gujarat.
