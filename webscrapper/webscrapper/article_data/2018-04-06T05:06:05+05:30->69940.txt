NEW DELHI: Four days before the deadline for filing nominations for   ends in West Bengal,   moved the SC on Thursday accusing TMC workers and state EC officials of colluding to prevent BJP candidates from contesting. A bench of CJI   and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud agreed to list the writ petition for hearing on Friday.

 Bhati said BJP candidates and workers were being threatened by TMC workers with the help of antisocial elements not to contest and the State EC had become a mute spectator to such illegalities aimed at distorting free and fair elections to panchayats.
