GAYA: Following a letter of the university authorities to the   ( ) to expedite the ongoing investigation in different cases of fraud and embezzlement including the much-publicised degree scam in which degree was awarded in fraudulent manner to several hundred foreigners including the ones who did not possess a student visa or even did not visit the country, has caused panic among university employees.

 Those on the vigilance scanner include non-teaching employees who allegedly supervised the ghost degree recipients and teachers who supervised more degree aspirants than legally permissible.
 
 Only recently, the high court too directed the vigilance bureau to investigate the criminal part of the Principalsâ€™ appointment case in which appointment of 22   principals was annulled first by single bench and subsequently by a double bench of the high court. The principals have since been removed from the position and sent back to their parent college/PG departments.
 
 At least three former VCs and several officials have been to jail in connection with degree and appointment scams and one former VC narrowly escaped jail hospitality by getting conditional bail by the same high court where he (former VC) had been a judge. While granting conditional bail to SC  , a former MU VC, the HC observed that high court judges, post retirement should not accept positions like that of the VC.
 
 Going by the number of vigilance inquiries going on in the university, the VIB should establish a camp office in MU, remarked a retired IG.
 
 The cases being investigated by the bureau include transfer of huge money from the examination fund of the university to individual accounts. On 06.08.2015 a sum of Rs 57.73 lakhs was transferred from the university's account to an individual account no. 3016014663.
 
 Again on 08.07.2015 and 31.08.2015 Rs 1.03 crore and Rs 56.13 lakh were transferred from the University account no. 14000928797 to an individual account no. 3270737475.
 
 In another incident of alleged embezzlement, Rs 79.8 lakh was withdrawn in cash from the university account no 14000928797.
