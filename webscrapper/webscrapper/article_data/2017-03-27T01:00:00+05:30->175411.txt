On   Banerjee’s first death anniversary on April 1, the late actress’ BFF   is all set to pay her a tearful tribute.   will release a short film, 'Hum Kuchh Keh Naa Sakey', online, in the memory of the 23-year-old actress. It was probably the last project for which Pratyusha, who hanged herself to death in her Oshiwara home, faced the camera. 
Shot one-and-a-half months before her suicide, the film, which features Pratyusha in the lead, bears an uncanny resemblance to her real life. To begin with, the subject revolves around heartbreak and depression, which were allegedly the reasons behind her drastic step.
 Kamya says, “Though a work of fiction, it will seem quite similar to what Pratyusha must have gone through. She will be seen heartbroken, resorting to vices like drinking and smoking. As a narrator, I will interlink her reel and real lives, and question viewers on why people change in love and choose to remain silent sufferers. Pratyusha didn’t use glycerine while shooting the emotional scenes. I too was nursing a heartbreak at that time.”
 Coming back to the coincidences, Pratyusha’s beau on screen is called Rahul, much like her real-life boyfriend,  . “It was Pratyusha’s decision to name the character Rahul,” reveals Kamya.
 Yet to recover from her friend’s untimely death, Kamya says that she regrets not having taken out time to talk to Pratyusha. “I wish we had spoken about our problems. I felt helpless watching the film. We couldn’t shoot the climax as she ended her life before that," she sums up.
