 “The high number of motorist deaths can be pinned to the large-scale flouting of the helmet rule and the use substandard helmets. Wearing proper safety gear can help in significantly bringing down the number of fatalities recorded among motorists, since head injuries have been identified as the top cause of fatalities among two-wheeler riders,” said  , CEO of the Indian Federation of Road Safety.
 
 Two-wheelers, four-wheelers, three-wheelers and state   buses have been identified as the ‘accused vehicle’ in a majority of the cases recorded this year, the data indicates.
