Actor Sudev Nair’s role as the malicious spirit in his latest film Ezra has opened doors for more characters with grey shades. 

 In his upcoming venture  , Sudev will once again be seen in a negative role. 
 Its director  , who has also scripted the comedy-thriller, says, “Most of our stories revolve around the life of the hero. This film will be different because it focuses on the antihero, except that it’s told through four youngsters.” 
 
 Roopesh Peethambaran, Rajeev Pillai, Dr Rony and Rakshadhikari Baiju fame Shankar Induchoodan play the youth while Sudev essays the anti-hero named William Marqetu.
 “Though his character has grey shades, he comes across as a likeable guy with an attractive personality,” says the debutant director.
 While Sudev is not a muscleman in the movie as the title suggests, he says, “Mine is a macho character, who is a threat to everybody. The film follows a few youngsters who accidentally land up in a major soup. My character brings in the twist to the plot, which is a comedy of errors akin to yesteryear Priyadarshan films.”
 
 The movie, which will go on floors by September, has Kochi and Thrissur as it prime locations. Anandam fame Vineetha Koshy and a debutante play the two heroines of the film with Pradeep Kottayam, Harish Kanaran and Biju Kuttan cast in supporting roles. 
 
 Meanwhile, Sudev is also shooting for another Malayalam film called Sleeplessly Yours, which he says, is mostly intended for film festivals. 
 “It’s an interesting story about a couple who experiments with sleep deprivation and its effects. The film has a non-linear narrative,” says Sudev, adding that theatre actress Devika plays the heroine in the movie directed by a few ad filmmakers.
