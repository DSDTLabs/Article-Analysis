BENGALURU: After a longdrawn battle, the government may return to farmers nearly 2,266 acres of land that it had earmarked for acquisition for setting up a steel plant in   district.

 In 2010, Tata   had planned to set up a Rs 15,000-crore three million tonnes per annum integrated steel plant in Haveri but it backed out last year citing the project became infeasible after the Supreme Court placed restrictions on iron ore mining in  .
 
 â€œWe have only issued a preliminary notification to acquire the land for Tata Metaliks and hence, the government can afford to give back the land to farmers, who have made a request. But a final call will be taken at the state highlevel clearance committee meeting soon," said industries minister  .
 
 At the Global Investors' Meet in June 2010, Tata Metaliks had offered to set up its plant and township and sought 2,500 acres in Haveri.Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) had subsequently issued a preliminary notification for acquiring about 1,658 acres in Boodugatti and Agadi villages and 608 acres in Devagiri and   villages of Haveri district, totalling 2,266 acres. The farmers were up in arms against the move.
 
 The firm's plans went awry in 2011 after a Supreme Court order. In a letter to the government, Deshpande said the firm sought refund of the deposit it had given to the government for land acquisition.
 
 TIMES VIEW
 
 At a time when the farming community is reeling under the effects of consecutive droughts, the government's decision to return land to the peasants is welcome news.While industrialization needs to be encouraged to ensure economic growth, the government cannot afford to disregard the impact of handing over large tracts of agricultural land for industrial purposes on the environment.Although leaders talk about uplifting farmers, their concerns are seldom reflected in policy. The government must step up efforts to increase agricultural activity across the state, by making it lucrative.
