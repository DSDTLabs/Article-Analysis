 The actress, who is winning the world with her acting chops and red carpet appearances, is going to be under the scanner for her general knowledge in a new segment called the five-second question answer.
 
 
 
 In the teaser, Karan asks Priyanka to name three Mughal emperors, three Maratha warriors and three Prime Ministers of India, to which the 'Quantico' star's answers vary between "arrey baba" and laughter. 
 
  
  
 We already know how   goofed up the President's name on the show and continues to be trolled for the same till date. Letâ€™s just hope Priyanka has answers to the questions asked by Karan and is able to save herself from being a target on social media.
