CHANDIGARH: A day after four militants were killed in Kashmir,   president Captain   pointed out on Monday that the “much touted” move to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes had failed to check the inflow of terrorists or fake currency from Pakistan to India.

 In a statement issued here,   said Sunday’s encounter in Kashmir and reports of Pakistan pushing fake Rs 2,000 notes into India via Bangladesh were “proof” that the decision was ill-conceived and not helping curb terror. “Sterner measures are needed to ensure foolproof border security if the nation and its people are to be guarded,” he said.
 
 He claimed that though demonetisation continued to create “serious problems” for people even after three months of its implementation, it was not “the solution” to a serious problem like terrorism. “There is sufficient ground to believe that black money remains a serious concern despite a whopping 86% of old currency getting frozen overnight,” he said. 
 
 He claimed that despite repeated demands from the   to come out in the open with facts and figures to substantiate his claims of the success of the demonetisation scheme, Modi had failed to disclose the total amount that had come into the government kitty in the wake of the move. “This shows that demonetisation failed to achieve any positive results,” he said.
