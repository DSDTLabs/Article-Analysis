Bhopal: Under pressure from National Green Tribunal and the state government, Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) council on Tuesday passed a resolution for setting up an abattoir at Adampur Chhawni. The decision triggered protests immediately in the area, indicating a fresh political tussle.

 A new forum, named Kankali Mandir Swabhiman Samiti, was floated on Tuesday, with locals calling the move “insensitive to their religious beliefs”. “Till now, we were opposing the civic body. Now, we will protest against the state government and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan,” said Brajesh Jain, one of the leaders of the protest.
 
 The abattoir project was held for months in the BMC council due to protests from villagers. Local politics had forced corporators from the area to take a united stand. The resolution came on Tuesday after directives from the state government, which had reversed a proposal by BMC that opposed establishment of an abattoir within municipal limits.
 
 Amid opposition from Adampur Chhawni residents, BMC Congress corporator Girish Sharma criticised BJP corporators for “going back on their promise”. Sharma went ahead and announced a protest rally on Bypass road, near the proposed abattoir site, on October 5. 
 
 BMC passed the proposal with little discussion. The proposal was opposed by Girish Sharma and another Congress colleague Amit Sharma. Mayor Alok Sharma and other senior BJP corporators, who had earlier opposed the proposal to establish a slaughterhouse in Adampur Chhawani, immediately left the ISBT building.
 
 The controversial location for the facility has been opposed by locals in Adampur. Opposition to the proposed site began in 2016, when local MLA Rameshwar Sharma announced that the slaughterhouse would “hurt the sentiments of residents”. Taking the same line, Congress leader Girish Sharma said, “The site is next to a temple of Maa Kankali. The BJP, which talks about protection of cows and Lord Ram, now lies exposed. There are vested interests at play, who want to establish an abattoir at Adampur Chhawani only. They could have opted for any other side that would not have hurt sentiments of thousands of people.”
 
 Newly appointed BMC commissioner Priyanka Das confirmed that the proposal has been approved by the BMC council and the abattoir will be developed at Adampur Chhawani. “The directive of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) will be adhered with. BMC has until March 2018 to comply with tribunal directives,” said Das. She indicated that the tender proposal to set up an abattoir on about 12 acre land would be initiated and communicated to the state government. Asked about an alternate location for the abattoir, Das said, “Land is allotted by the state government.”
