NAGPUR: The Regional Transport Office (RTO) has detected a case of registration of two school buses through fraudulent means.

 The RTO records showed two school buses (MH-31-CQ-4540 and MH31CQ4233) had been granted contract carriage permits from Nagpur RTO. The first one is owned by Sandeep Gupta who runs the travel firm Shri Balaji Travels in Gondia. The other is registered in the name of New Goodwills Tours and Travels in which Gupta is a partner.
 
 The matter came to light following an unknown complaint of bogus documents submitted by Gupta. On verifying the documents of MH31CQ4540 vehicle, the RTO learnt that the bus was registered in   while Gupta had submitted a no-objection certificate from the   transport department that claiming he had purchased the bus from Agarwal Motors, Satna, on May 31, 2008. In AP, the chassis was of a 2005 model while in Nagpur it was of 2008.
 
 The documents of the bus, which Gupta claimed to have had purchased from Udaipur, too was found to have been forged. The certificate of registration of Udaipur RTO shows the seller as Roshan Motors Pvt Limited and the buyer as  , son of Deepak Singh, a resident of Udaipur. But the same person was known as Wallabhdas Jaiswal, a resident of Gondia.
 
 Gupta also managed to secure a Rs 30 lakh contract to run the 54-seater bus in WCL Sub Area in Ballarpur to ferry schoolchildren. Instead of using a 3-year-old bus model as per the tender condition, Gupta allegedly plied a 10-year-old bus with bogus papers. WCL’s chief vigilance officer Ashok Labhane said he will look into the matter.
 
 “Earlier, a police complaint had been filed against Gupta in Ballarpur police station and two buses were also confiscated,” said the RTO officer.
 
 Sources said Gupta has managed to dispose of one of the ‘forged’ buses in Odisha.
