UNNAO/LUCKNOW: The younger brother of BJP MLA   was arrested on Tuesday in connection with the mysterious death of   rape survivor’s father on Monday even as the   government set up a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the matter. The survivor has accused the MLA and his aides of gang-raping her in June last year.

 The girl’s father was in judicial custody after his arrest on April 4 for a brawl with the MLA’s brother, Atul, and his associates. He was moved from the Unnao jail to hospital on Sunday when he complained of stomach ache and died there the next day.
 
 Four persons were arrested on Monday for the attack on the girl’s father but no action was taken against Atul as his name didn’t figure in the FIR.
 
 Atul was produced before a court in Unnao on Tuesday evening and sent to jail. Additional director general of police (ADG)  , who heads the SIT, said murder charges have been incorporated in the case against Atul and others, who were initially booked for assault. The rape survivor met the Unnao district magistrate on Tuesday and was in tears when she spoke to mediapersons outside the DM office. She alleged that she was raped by the MLA on June 4 last year.
