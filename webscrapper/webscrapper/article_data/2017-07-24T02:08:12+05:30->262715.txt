MUMBAI: Police’s only hope to get a description of the accused hangs in uncertainty as the   of the two schoolgoing boys who consumed poison after being allegedly sodomized has slipped into  .

  The   has started a parallel probe to identify and track the person identified as  , whose has been named in the FIR.
 
 The 13-year-old class VIII student has again been put on life support. “He was weaned off the ventilator, but now is back on  ,” said a doctor. “A liver transplant is the best bet to save him, but we haven’t got the organ so far.” The boy’s name has been registered with the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee for an emergency transplant. His parents have shown reluctance to donate a part of their liver after being informed of the risks involved for live donor. 
 
 Powai police suspect that the accused may have lured the 10-year-old and the 13-year-old with gifts or valuables to the spot where they committed the offence, but they are yet to identify the spot where the crime took place. Police suspect the boys took the extreme step perhaps after being repeatedly sexually assaulted. 
 
 Police interacted with at least 12 friends of the survivor on Saturday, but most of them were scared to answer their queries. “The survivor’s friends and their parents were nervous and gave contradictory replies, which has left us with little hope,” said a Powai police officer.
 
 DCP (zone X) Navinchandra Reddy said “On July 19, the survivor told his mother that he and his 10-year-old friend were sodomized.” According to the survivor’s father, both boys consumed rat poison mixed in aerated drinks on July 12. The other boy’s parents didn’t know that he had consumed poison as the medical report said he died of dehydration. “We have not thought of exhuming the 10-year-old boy’s body as there is no concrete evidence,” said Reddy.
