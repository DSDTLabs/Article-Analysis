HYDERABAD: A contract labourer, working at the   (NSG)  , died in a   at a nearby lake while he was fishing with his colleagues on Sunday.

 The victim, identified as Nandulal Patel, 20, of Bilaspur in Chattisgarh, was one of the 100 plus private construction labourers working at the NSG’s training centre in Ibrahimpatnam. On Sunday morning, Patel along with four of his colleagues went to Tattikhana lake, located a kilometre away from the  , for fishing. 
 
 “As the five men were catching fish where water was shallow in the lake, a blast occurred when Patel stepped on an explosive material. He suffered injuries to his left foot, private parts, abdomen and died on the spot. His colleagues, who were standing close by, suffered no injuries,” Ibrahimpatnam inspector V Swamy told TOI.
 
 After the mishap, the Ibrahimpatnam police rushed to the spot along with forensic specialists and scoured the entire area for any trace of explosives. “We have not found any explosive materials. The forensic team collected samples from the crime scene to analyse,” the inspector added.
 
 “We suspect that some locals might have planted explosives on the lake bed to kill wild boars. “Also, a check dam was built near the blast spot with boulders during the rainy season to prevent bund breach. There is possibility of detonators being left there after the construction and the victim might have accidentally stepped on the leftover detonators, triggering a blast,” Ibrahimpatnam assistant commissioner of police (ACP) S Malla Reddy, who visited the spot, told TOI.
 
 The FSL experts seized the damaged footwear of Patel along with other items from the spot. A case was registered under sections 174 (suspicious death) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and the Explosive Substances Act.
