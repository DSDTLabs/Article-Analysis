PUNE: A   labourer, who went missing on the night of July 16, was found   in the lift duct of a deserted school building near Navale hospital in Narhe on Tuesday.

 The Sinhagad Road police said that Ganesh (full name not known) was allegedly murdered by   labourers following a quarrel and dumped into the duct of the building. “We are yet to arrest the labourers as they did not turn up at work since July 17,” said Baban Khodade, inspector of the Sinhagad Road police.
 
 Ganesh’s friend Parmanand Gode (22) lodged a complaint with the Sinhagad Road police. “Though they were friends, Gode neither knew Ganesh’s full name nor where he hailed from,” Khodade said adding, “We are yet to trace Ganesh’s family members.”
 
 On Tuesday, some employees of the Sinhagad Spring Dale School opened the building for some cleaning work. “The foul smelling compound drew suspicion and they alerted the police. When we checked the school building, we found a highly decomposed body lying in the lift duct,” Khodade said.
 
 Police sought fire brigade’s help in removing the body. “The body was in a bad condition and difficult to pull out. The fire brigade had to fill the duct with water. They body was removed as soon as it started to float,” Khodade said.
 
 Gode said that Ganesh and four other labourers from Jharkhand were hired for the construction work of a building nearby. On the night of July 16, all of them consumed liquor. “Ganesh got into a dispute with the four suspects over a trivial issue. The suspects may have killed him and dumped his body in the duct,” Khodade said.
