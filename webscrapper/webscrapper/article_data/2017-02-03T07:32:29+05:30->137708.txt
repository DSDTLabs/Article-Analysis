CHENNAI: The   on Wednesday trashed a public interest litigation petition seeking a ban on the animal rights organisation,   (PeTA), saying the PIL was a ‘misadventure’ filed in the present context for the sake of ‘publicity’ as   has been opposing jallikattu.

 The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice M Sundar, rejecting the PIL filed by Dinesh, said: “We repeatedly posed a query to counsel for the petitioner under what law does this court issue a mandamus to ban an organisation. It would be the pregorative of the executive, if any law is violated, to take action against any such an organisation.”
 
 The PIL said the PeTA website contained ‘sexist advertisements’ and that it had hosted ‘XXX porn site as a marketing endeavour.” It said, “the endeavour of PeTA is stated to be affecting children and women rights.” It accused PeTA of indulging in ‘unncessary activities like filing frivolous PILs against the very same government which has allowed its operation in India.” It said the rights body had acted contrary to the “sovereignty and integrity of India by filing vexatious PILs against the sovereign powers of India, acted against general public interest and created disharmony between communities.”
 
 The first bench rejected all these averments: “We are troubled by the tenor of the petition which seeks to suggest that the entertaining of petitions by the Supreme Court filed by PeTA amounts to violation of the sovereignty and integrity of India, and because PeTA sought to challenge a statutory law made in India, it should be banned. In our view, this is contemptuous of the Supreme Court.”
 
 On the alleged pornographic content in the PeTA website, the judges said: “On a perusal, we find nothing of this sort.”
