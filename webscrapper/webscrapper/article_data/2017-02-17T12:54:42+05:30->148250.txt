Few days after the passing of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma announced that he will be making a biopic on her close confidante, Sasikala Natrajan. Now, RGV has gone on to reveal more details about this upcoming project. 
 
 
 
Taking to Twitter, he declared that he will depict a completely unknown side of Sasikala and the mysterious dynamics that she shared with Jayalalithaa. He also added that only Sasikala's closest family members, who are sometimes called Manargudi mafia, will be able to completely understand his tale. “'Sasikala' is going to be the story of the story behind Sasikala in front of Sasikala and only Manargudi mafia members will understand this. The truth behind Jayalalitha and Sasikala relationship, what Poes garden servants told me is unimaginably shocking and I will show it in my film. Poes garden's gardener told me majority MLAs supporting Palanisamy because they all are handpicked by Sasikala from members of the manargudi mafia.” 
 
If all goes as planned, RGV might just blow this entire case wide open and reveal the entire truth about one of the most influential figures in Tamil Nadu politics.
