CHENNAI: Three weeks after removing bar on use of living persons pictures on digital banners and hoardings, the   has dismissed a   plea against chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, for allegedly disobeying the stay order while it was in force.

 On October 23, Justice S Vaidyanathan issued a blanket ban against use of pictures of living persons on digital banners. The prohibitory order was passed to maintain a clean atmosphere in   and to avoid unnecessary drawings on the walls of buildings/residential places. 
 
 While the order was in force, social activist   moved a contempt plea in the high court seeking action against Palaniswami, Panneerselvam and VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan for contempt of court, saying they violated the stay order by erecting banners with pictures of living persons.
 
 While the contempt plea was pending, on December 20, the first bench headed by Chief Justice   vacated the stay on an appeal moved by the Chennai Corporation.
 
 On Friday, when the contempt plea came up for hearing, Justice Vaidyanathan said: “I am of the view that since the order dated October 23, 2017 passed by me got merged with the order dated December 20, 2017 passed by the first bench of this court, on the principle of doctrine of merger, the present contempt petition cannot be entertained.”
 
 However, the court said if the petitioner was aggrieved, it was open to him to put forth his grievance before the division bench concerned for any relief.
