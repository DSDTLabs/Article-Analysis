Madurai: As many as 400 differently-abled people attended the special grievance day organised for them for the first time at the Madurai district collectorate on Wednesday. It gave them an opportunity to meet the collector with ease without having to compete with others at the grievance days on Mondays and this was really helpful, said a petitioner who took part in the meet. Most of the petitioners came with the help of others in wheelchairs and some of them became restless when they had to wait for some time to meet the collector as he was in a discussion with the farmers. “We understand that the farmers are in a crisis, but most of us went through lot of hardships to come here as we had to pay Rs 300 for an auto rickshaw to come here which is too expensive for us,” said a petitioner. Collector K Veera Raghava Rao met the petitioners individually and listened to their grievances and many of them made requests for tricycles and other benefits. As many as 454 petitions were received from the participants. They included monetary help to the tune of Rs 39,000 for 26 students studying in standards 10, 11 and 12 to ensure that they continue their education and braille watches worth Rs 12,000 were given to eight people. Welfare benefits to the tune of Rs 62,000 were distributed to 36 beneficiaries at the grievance day. A meal was organised by the district administration for the petitioners on the occasion. District Differently Abled Welfare Rehabilitation officer, Brahmanayagam and special deputy collector (social security scheme) Shantha were also present at the meet. TNN
