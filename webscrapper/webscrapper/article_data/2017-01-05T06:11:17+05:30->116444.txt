CHANDIGARH: The survey results on TV channels are the answer to this. The same channels were showing us at number three, three months ago.They have put us at top now. The reason is our development projects: European style-heritage walk around the Golden Temple, war memorial and bus rapid transport ( B RT S ) in Amritsar; three new airports at Mohali, Bathinda, and Adampur; shooting range at Mohali; 2,000 diagnostic centres and 46 lane roadways connecting all 22 districts. Besides, we lavishly spent on big religious projects including Rs 250-crore Valmiki Temple a n d R s 250-crore Ravidas Temple. This deve l o p m e n t i s unmatched w h e n com pared to the Congress tenure.

 
 
 
 People in this country have realized that NDA is the gover nment to take the fight against black money forward. UPA never showed any such initiative.
 
 People have begun to re pose faith in Narendra Modi.
 
 He is a doer and will show India's prowess to the world with a g rowing economy. We are op timistic that our development and Modi's brand of aggressive lead ership will help us win the elec tions for the third time.
 
 
 AAP will not score beyond 7-10 seats. In my opinion, the Congress will come second.Didn't AAP see rebellion with their leaders either joining the Congress or Shiromani Akali Dal?
 
 
 
 They were not winning the elections. We wanted to throw them out anyway.We have not been affected by people like Inderbir Bolaria, Pargat or  .
 
 
 
 That's because people have put trust in this family .
 
 
 
 All tickets have been given based on meritocracy and winnability .
 
 
 I can't say about future but at the moment my father is the CM candidate as long as he's around.
