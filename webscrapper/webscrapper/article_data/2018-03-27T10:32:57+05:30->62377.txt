JODHPUR: About 240 years before the launch of   in Uttar Pradesh by Sunderlal  , 363 persons of the Bishnoi community had laid down their lives to save the ‘khejadi’ trees (Prosopis cineraria) in Jodhpur’s Khejadli village in 1730.

 The Jodhpur king had ordered wood for the masonry work at the fort, following which his   reached Khejadli village, dotted with ‘khejadi’ trees. The king was forced to step back after the locals laid down their lives to protect the trees. Bahuguna was inspired by this movement.
 
 “The villagers from the Bishnoi community, led by Amrita Devi, had protested the move. Amrita Devi embraced a tree, followed by her three daughters. But on the order of Diwan, the soldiers hacked their heads. Seeing this, the villagers came forward one by one and started embracing the trees,” said Rampal Bhawad of the  , a community organisation.
 
 The army went on to slaughter 363 villagers before the Jodhpur king learnt about the incident and ordered them to stop the brutality. Thus, 363 villagers sacrificed their lives to protect the trees, something which is an unmatched example across the globe. 
 
 According to Bhawad, this was the first   movement in history, when villagers embraced trees to protect them and laid the foundation for Bahuguna’s movement. “Bahuguna himself had expressed his respect for Khejadli movement and was inspired by it to launch the Chipko Movement in UP,” Bhawad said. Today, the spot is revered by the Bishnoi community and all those who are concerned about the environment. An annual memorial held at the spot in Khejadli village, a pilgrimage now, in the month of September draws a huge crowd, who pay obeisance to 363 martyrs by offering ‘ahuti’ at the ‘agni kund’.
