Coimbatore: Parents of students studying at St Joseph’s Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Ondipudur staged a protest in front of the school on Thursday alleging that the school had forced students from class VI to class IX,  , get transfer certificates (TC).

 About 30 parents, who had gathered in front of the school, said the school management had been pressuring them to shift their children to other schools as their wards were weak in studies. “The authorities told us that the school would detain our wards for one year or else they said we had to shift our wards to other schools,” said the parent of a class VIII student. “Last year, they had given my child a ‘warning promotion’, meaning if he didn’t perform well the next year, they would detain him. This year, they are asking me to move my child to another school,” he said.
 
 Also, some parents said when they approached the school management for TC, the authorities asked them for a letter stating they had got the TC willingly. “How can we give such a letter when the school management had forced us into taking TCs,” said another parent, who had approached the school on Monday to get TC for his child, a class VI student.
 
 On Thursday, when the parents gathered in front of the school, the management held talks with four of them. Another meeting is scheduled for Friday.
 
 Meanwhile, Fr A Maria Joseph, principal of the school, said the school management had not forced any parent to get TC. “We had just highlighted the positions of students, who were not performing well in academics. In the case where both the parents were working, we asked them to devote more time to their children’s studies. If they were not able to do so, we gave them the option of moving their wards to a boarding school, where they stood a chance to perform better,” he said.
