NAVI MUMBAI: The NMMC   has come down heavily again on societies and and commercial establishments that are yet to set up their waste disposal system. 

 Sending a message to   that have failed to start their own composting units, the Nerul based   which has over 400 l stores under its umbrella, as well as a Domino’s Pizza outlet were served notices for failing to follow the norms laid down by the solid waste management rules 2016. 
 
 Haware Centurion Mall, was stated to have not commissioned independent wet waste compositing system.
 
 The pizza outlet was served notice for failing to keep dustbins to prevent littering. “ The owner was asked to maintain cleanliness of its premises or as per section 378 of MRTP Act ,   will be forced to cancel their licence,” said the sanitary official. 
 
 “As per the solid waste norms, bulk waste generators such as societies and commercial outlets are required to dispose their own wet waste. Since the mall falls under the category of bulk waste generating establishments, the management was repeatedly instructed to set up their own composting unit but it failed to do so,” said a solid waste department official.
 
 “In absence of the composting system it was understood that no segregation was happening. Notices were served that stated that by April 20 the mall will have to set up its own wet waste composting unit. Else, the civic administration will stop collecting dry waste as well,” said the DMC Tushar Pawar.
 
 The mall officials said that they are working on setting up a composting unit. 
 
 “The cooperative society to administer the mall premises was formed only on Tuesday. Now that the society is in place, we have requested NMMC to grant us some time to set up our own composting unit at the earliest,” said the Saroj Nayak, chairman of Haware Centurion Premises Society Cooperative limited. 
 
 The manager for the Pizza outlet when contacted was not available for comment.
