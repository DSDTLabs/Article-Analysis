 Chennai: Scotching rumours of a new political bloc among non-BJP parties of the southern states, AIADMK on Tuesday skipped the meeting of southern finance ministers, called by Kerala’s LDF government, to discuss the concerns and views arising out of Terms of Reference of 15th finance commission. Instead, CM Edappadi K Palaniswami convened a meeting with state ministers and bureaucrats about the impact of the proposal in Secretariat.
 
 The staying away from the Kerala meet by Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam is seen prudent by the ruling AIADMK, which had called it “imposition of Leftist policies.” Neither did the government depute any junior cabinet member nor bureaucrats for the meet to discuss concerns arising out the 15th finance commission proposals, that suggested using 2011 population data for devolution of Central funds than 1971 census data which is being used until now. “We find the meeting more of imposing the Leftist ideals and will not make any impact. We need the Centre’s support to bring an end to Cauvery dispute,” said AIADMK propaganda wing deputy secretary and spokesperson, Vaigai Selvan. 
 
 It was a collective decision of Palaniswami and Panneerselvam against participating in the meet. While there were reports of finance secretary K Shanmugam representing the state, “no instruction was given” to the officer until Monday night. The state government feels a “conciliatory approach” would be beneficial than confrontational attitude with the Centre at this juncture.
