PUNE: The   ( ) is ready to deal with the monsoon but concerns remain over the audit of unsafe buildings. 

 The commissioning of the sewage treatment plant at Bootee Street, a key element in the new sewage disposal system of the Cantonment area, has not been done. 
 
 Officials said the plant may not be operational before October. Two previous deadlines have already been missed.
 
 "Our monsoon preparatory works started from May with a special team," chief executive officer DN Yadav said. The focus is to clear two main nullahs in the area, along with sewage lines, and manage waste at the trenching grounds in Hadapsar.
 
 "A team has been assigned to clear the main points of Manik and Bhairoba nullahs. They are also cleaning the main sewage lines so that draining of excess water in heavy rain is smooth. This year, we have also made sure that garbage is managed at the trenching grounds. Vehicles have been instructed to dump garbage in the shed. We have started vermiculture and 30 pits have already been readied at the trenching ground," he added.
 
 Officials admitted that   have been hurdles to the safety of dangerous buildings in the monsoon. 
 
 A two storeyed-building off   gave way last August after heavy rains. Probes revealed that its lease holders were sent notices.
 
 "We identify the buildings which are potentially dangerous before every monsoon, and send notices to their leaseholders, telling them to undertake urgent repairs. Some follow instructions. But almost all properties are occupied by tenants, and we can issue notices only to the leaseholders. There are many legal disputes which happen over such repairs between the tenant and the leaseholder. Hence, repairs get affected, and the buildings remain a danger to people living in it, especially during the monsoon," a senior engineering official of the PCB said.
