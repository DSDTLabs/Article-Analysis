MUMBAI: A Rajasthan police officer deposing in the alleged fake encounter case of   and his associate   told a special court on Friday he was threatened by   officers and forced to give a statement as tutored by them. Denying the contents of the statement given before the magistrate on August 25, 2011, the 55-year-old officer said it was given under pressure.

 
 "The CBI officer Kandaswamy had confined me for a whole day in his office and threatened to implicate and arrest me if I didn't give a statement as per their choice," he said. The officer and a police constable were both declared hostile after they denied the statements produced by the CBI. The second cop denied ever giving his statement to the CBI.
 
 So far 55 of the 82 prosecution witnesses have turned hostile in the case. On April 5, another Rajasthan cop had claimed Kandaswamy threatened to arrest him if he did not depose as per CBI's say.
