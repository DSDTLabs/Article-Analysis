Over the years, Bollywood has become a lot more welcoming to discussing mental health issues. While   was one of the firsts to come out with her story, Alia Bhatt’s sister Shaheen had also shared her ordeal with depression in a social media post.

  
  
 
  Now it looks like Shaheen is all set to write a book on the same. Her mother  , in fact, reportedly confirmed the news that a book is indeed in the works where her daughter will recount her experience that is aimed at people to accept their mental condition and not be ashamed about it. Soni also apparently added that her daughter is brave to discuss this issue on a public platform and that she, husband   and Alia stand with her. The yet untitled book is expected to come out in a few months’ time.
