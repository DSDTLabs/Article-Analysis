GAYA: The erstwhile guesthouse of   located in Patna may become a bone of contention between MU and newly-created   under the ongoing process of distribution of assets and liabilities.

 Though the land and buildings of constituent colleges located in Patna and Nalanda districts would automatically go to Pataliputra University, sources said MU is unlikely to give up its claim over the varsity guesthouse.
 
 Earlier, part of College of Commerce, arts and science, the guesthouse in Patna is owned by MU and the college transferred part of its land to the university for establishment of its guesthouse. At present, the guesthouse is the camp office of Pataliputra University.
 
 A senior MU official said besides being MU property, the university needed the guesthouse for practical purposes. As MU will conduct the examination of students admitted to sessions 2015-18, 2016-19 and 2017-20 for colleges located in Patna and Nalanda districts as well, the university needs space in Patna also. 
 
 MU VC Prof Qamar Ahsan said he was not supposed to share asset division details with the media. “I will put forward my views at the Raj Bhavan meet on Wednesday,” he said.
 
 While conceding that he has already held informal talks with his Pataliputra University counterpart, Ahsan said a structured discussion will be held at the Chancellor's office.
 
 According to Nageshwar Sharma, former director, higher education, Pataliputra University cannot claim any part of land on which the MU headquarters has been set up as it was the Mahanth of Bodh   who had donated it exclusively for the establishment of the University and the 450 acre plus land cannot be put to any other use.
 
 Sources said that the Pataliputra University is likely to function from BS College, Danapur, and the permanent campus may be located either in Bihita or Phulwarisharif as a minimum of 40 acres of land is required for the university's establishment and the required space is not available anywhere else.
