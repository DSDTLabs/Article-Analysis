LUCKNOW:   on Monday arrested a man from   for his links with   and Kashmir based terror groups and supplying arms to them. 

 The ATS sleuths arrested the accused, identified as   Akbar, a resident of Zamania, Ghazipur, when he was going towards Hazratganj from Gomtinagar, and seized his mobile for investigation. During questioning, Akbar told the police that he communicated with terror operatives in J&K only through WhatsApp calls which are extremely difficult to intercept. "Terror groups now prefer to make WhatsApp calls than voice calls," said DGP OP Singh and added that some more inputs have been collected and ATS had been asked to pursue the leads.
 
 The arrest was made following a tip off from J&K Police who had arrested some terror suspects from   in North Kashmir. During questioning they told J&K Police that terrorists in Kashmir Valley got arms through an arms smuggling ring extending to Nepal and Bihar via UP. The name of arms smuggler was shared with UP Police following which inspector general ATS Aseem Arun constituted a team under DySP Vijaymal Yadav to nab him. 
 
 Shaikh was heading towards Hazratganj from Gomtinagar when the team intercepted him. Arun said that recently Rs 40,000 were transferred into Shaikh's bank account by the terror operatives who had fixed an arms deal with him. "He was also planning to visit Pakistan. Some extremist videos and literature have been recovered from his phone and we are trying to find out others involved in supplying firearms," added Arun.
