VADODARA: In one of the biggest   hauls in the recent past, the city police seized Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) worth Rs 37.82 lakh near a hotel on the national highway close to Makarpura on Wednesday. 

 The liquor seizure is being linked to notorious bootlegger Alpesh Wadhwani alias Alpu Sindhi.
 
 The Makarpura police had got information that a truck containing liquor was parked near the Matruchhaya Hotel on the highway. The police reached the spot and found the truck parked behind the hotel. On searching, they found cartons of whiskey, rum and beer of various brands in it. 
 
 The police also nabbed Vijay Mokhra, a resident of Warasiya area in the city, from the spot.
 
 It has come to light that the liquor catche worth Rs 37,82,400 was to be received by Wadhwani. The cartons were to be shifted to smaller vehicles and taken to different locations. The truck was owned by one Vinay Rawat, a resident of Haryana.
 
 This is not the first time that police have seized liquor stock of Wadhwani. In June last year, state monitoring cell had seized IMFL stock worth Rs 18 lakh from a plot in Amaliyapura village on   highway. A month later, Vadodara crime branch had seized another stock of Rs 10 lakh on the outskirts of Padmala village near the city. Few weeks after these seizures, Wadhwani was nabbed by from Sama.
 
 Sindhi is considered to be one of the biggest suppliers of liquor in central Gujarat besides his rival Lalchand Khanani alias Lalu Sindhi, whose name had cropped up in murder case of gangster Mukesh Harjani. It is believed that Wadhwani carries out his business in partnership with Zuber Memon who has not been arrested by police yet.
