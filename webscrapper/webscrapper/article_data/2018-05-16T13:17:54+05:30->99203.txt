SURAT: An aware citizen in the Diamond City has written to Prime Minister   exposing corruption in the railways. 

 Vijay Kumar Gupta was travelling to Ahmedabad from Surat in the Navjivan Express train on Monday with unconfirmed ticket. Gupta approached   to know about availability of seat in 3AC. The TTE demanded Rs 300 for the seat and when Gupta asked him to provide him a receipt, the TTE demanded Rs 500 for the receipt. 
 
 Gupta has also written to the railway minister and   about corrupt practices by TTEs in trains and has urged initiation of strict action. 
 
 Vijay Gupta, who works with a private company in the city, told TOI, “I was travelling to Ahmedabad to catch a flight to Bangalore for some official work. Since I could not get confirmed train ticket, I thought of requesting the TTE to arrange a seat for me in 3AC. The TTE asked me to shell out Rs 300, which I did. The TTE kept the money in his pocket and wrote the seat number on my ticket.” 
 
 Gupta added, “I told the TTE to issue me an official receipt so that I could claim the money from my company. The TTE told me that official receipt would cost Rs 500 and that I can travel without it by paying only Rs 300.” 
 
 Gupta said, Navjivan Express is terminated at Ahmedabad station and that most seats in the 3AC coach were vacant. 
 
 “I am surprised about the income of the TTEs. Apart from monthly salary from the railways, the TTEs are earning huge amount of money by looting passengers. It is high time that the railway authorities initiate action against corrupt officials,” Gupta said. 
 
 Following the tweet by Gupta on the official Twitter handle of railway minister Piyush Goyal and Western Railway, the railway authorities have started investigation into the issue.
