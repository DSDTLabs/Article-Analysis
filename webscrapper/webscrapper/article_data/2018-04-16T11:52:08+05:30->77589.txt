 As per the ban, mechanized boats are barred from venturing out in the sea till June 14, which will be the time for the onset of southwest monsoon. 
 
 “If any mechanised boat violates the order, we will seize the vessel and slap a large penalty on the boat owner,” said a fisheries officer, while adding that the ban is applicable to the entire east coast.
 
 Earlier the ban was limited to 40-45 days, but from the last one year the ban was extended to 61 days due to boost in the   population, said Arjili Dasu, executive director of  .
 
 Dasu said that government should give a subsidy on fuel as the present price of diesal, which is between Rs 65 and Rs 70 is adversely affecting the business of the fishermen.
