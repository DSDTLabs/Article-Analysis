CHENNAI: For the first time, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has listed reasons why it had not renewed   Copper’s consent to operate (CTO) after it expired on March 31 .

 The TNPCB appellate authority has, meanwhile, postponed to May 17 its   of an appeal by Sterlite Copper against the board’s decision to not renew the CTO. In a counter affidavit filed before the authority on Monday against Sterlite’s appeal, the board laid out its reasons for not   the CTO.
 
 As reported earlier by TOI, among the five grounds TNPCB spelled out are: Copper slag dumping along the Uppar obstructed the flow of the river, and the firm failed to construct a physical barrier between the Uppar and a landfill, allowing slag to reach the river.
 
 The other reasons include failure to furnish a report of groundwater analysis of borewells near the site. The regulator also stated that the unit generates and disposes hazardous wastes without valid authorisation.
 
 “Authorisation for disposal issued to the unit on July 10, 2008 expired on July 9, 2013. The application submitted by the unit was returned for want of additional details and the unit has not resubmitted the same yet,” the petition stated.
 
 The unit had also failed to analyse arsenic content in the ambient air and has not constructed a   pond according to guidelines.
 
 Sterlite’s counsel stated orally before the appellate authority that the unit had complied with four of five grounds on which their CTO was not renewed and that the authorisation for hazardous waste disposal is pending with TNPCB.
 
 The unit’s counsel argued that the case had to be heard at the earliest as the Sterlite unit has incurred losses of several hundred crores of rupees.
