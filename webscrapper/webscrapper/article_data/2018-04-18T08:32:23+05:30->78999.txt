LUCKNOW: Over the next two days, the   team is expected to go through the statement of the survivor given to the special judicial magistrate in Lucknow.

 The girl from   had appeared before special CBI magistrate Sapna Tripathi on Monday to give her statement under CrPC section 164. Her statement runs into six pages, said CBI sources.
 
 The central agency re-registered four FIRs in connection with the case which began from June 4, 2017 in Makhi village. Deputy SP RR Tripathi and his team have been entrusted with the job of probing the charges levelled in all four FIRs.
 
 In her complaint against   MLA  , the girl had alleged that on June 4, 2017, a woman from her locality, Shashi Singh, had taken her to his house around 8pm. Shashi was going to seek the MLA’s help to find a job for the girl but Sengar instead confined her inside his house in Makhi and sexually assaulted her, states the complaint.
 
 Shashi waited outside instead of stopping the MLA and hence was made a co-accused.
 
 The CBI is going to probe another FIR that the girl’s family had lodged in June. The girl alleged father was allegedly attacked by the MLA’s younger brother Atul Sengar and four others allegedly for not withdrawing the complaint against the BJP MLA. The girl’s father was sent to jail where he died on April 9, a day after the girl tried to immolate herself in Lucknow.
 
 Tripathi began examining the charges levelled by the girl’s family in the FIRs on Tuesday and also visited Makhi police station.
 
 Joint director of CBI’s Lucknow branch GK Goswami and CBI SP Raghavendra Vatsa also visited Unnao on Tuesday.
 
 “We have broken the entire episode into two legs. A separate team is working on the matter that transpired in June 2017 and the other one on the events that took place in April 2018. We have hundreds of phone call recordings, call records and alibis to check. The role of dozens of policemen, government doctors and jail staff members would be scrutinised,” said an officer.
