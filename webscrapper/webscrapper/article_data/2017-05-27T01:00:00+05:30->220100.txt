While it’s not uncommon for actors to use their personal belongings for a film, it can backfire at times. As it happened in the case of   Aryan, during the shoot of his upcoming comedy, 'Guest Iin  ', with  .
Kartik, who sports a stubble in the film, brought his personal trimmer to the shoot. Now, the movie too has a scene where Paresh uses a trimmer. Somehow, the senior actor ended up using his co-actor’s personal trimmer in the sequence. 
 While Paresh didn’t know that it was Kartik’s personal trimmer, the younger actor’s expression was priceless. It played out so well, albeit inadvertently, director Ashwani Dhir decided to retain the ‘natural’ shot in the film. 
  On his part, Kartik had to discard the trimmer after the shoot. We hear that he got a new one and kept it locked away, lest Paresh or anyone else use that, too.
