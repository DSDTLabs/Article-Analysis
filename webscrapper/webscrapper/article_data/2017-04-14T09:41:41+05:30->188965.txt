SILCHAR: The NH-54 (E) connecting the town with Haflong in   has been reopened for traffic after 12 days after   away sections of the road. 

 Movement of vehicles through the 108-km stretch became normal from Wednesday, with rainfall having stopped and authorities having cleared landslides and repaired the stretches where rushing rainwater washed away parts of the road, a senior official said.
 
 Torrential rain since the last week of March created havoc in the hill district along with neighbouring Barak Valley. The Silchar-Haflong road was one of the main victims of the calamity as road communication between the two neighbouring districts had been disrupted. Landslides also occurred in many places including Durbin Tilla. Areas including Boro Muolkoi, Dimbruchera, Bormuolkoi, Miyunkro etc were in a vulnerable state as well. 
 
 On April 3, Subrata Paul (48), a school teacher in the hill district who was passing through a stretch of   road on foot at Kapurcherra near Harangajao, was washed away by rainwater that was rushing from Barail hills. His body was recovered next day.
 
 Sources said another shower could disrupt traffic in this route as the road is poorly manned by the authorities.
