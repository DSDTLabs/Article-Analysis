Vadodara: Driver of a private luxury bus from Jodhpur was attacked and robbed of Rs 80,000 cash and his gold chain worth Rs 25,000 by four persons at Dumad crossroads near the city early on Sunday.

 The driver Rakesh Sain told the police that while they were on their way to Jodhpur from Bengaluru, a car registered in Aurangabad in Maharashtra intercepted them at Dumad crossroads around 4.15 am on Sunday. Four persons, one of whom was identified as Mahendra Singh, got out of the car and dragged Sain out of the bus. The accused beat up Sain with hockey sticks and took away Rs 80,000 cash from his pocket. Another person also snatched away his gold chain. The cash belonged to the travels company which owned the bus.
 
 In the meantime, another driver of the bus Laxmanran Jat came to Sain’s rescue. Jat identified Singh and tried to stop them from beating Sain. Few minutes later another bus of their travels company reached there and passengers of the bus also got down to rescue Sain. Police said that seeing so many people coming to the rescue of the two drivers, the four accused fled towards Vadodara city in their car.
 
 A police official said that in their statements, Jat and Sain told that they know Singh and they have been having issues with Singh since quite some time. “We have learnt that Singh is a travel agent and is also from Rajasthan like the two drivers. The car which that they had used was of a friend of Singh’s,” said a police official, adding that they should be able to find the accused within a day or two.
