MUMBAI: A week after the   granted bail to accused   in the 2008  , she has moved the trial court seeking discharge in the case. The National Investigation Agency will submit its reply. 

 The HC, while granting the bail, observed that it cannot be said that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusations made against the sadhvi are prima facie true. The sadhvi was booked as a main conspirator who allegedly provided her motorcycle to plant the explosives. Her advocate, Prashant Maggu, cited the HC's observation in the discharge plea. Maggu said that this strengthened their eligibility to be granted the relief.
