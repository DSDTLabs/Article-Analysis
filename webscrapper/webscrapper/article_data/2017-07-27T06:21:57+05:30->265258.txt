JAIPUR: Irregularities in the construction of toilets have been found in Rajasthan, Union minister for drinking water and sanitation   admitted in Parliament.

 In his reply to a question in Rajya Sabha on July 17, the Union minister said, the state government has been asked to take appropriate corrective measures.
 
 Citing a case from Karauli district, the minister said the toilet constructed at a rural household was being used to store cow dung cakes, defying the aim of Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) to get rid of open defecations. At another place, the house owner built a second structure adjacent to the toilet and claimed payment for both under the SBM.
 
 From Jodhpur district, the ministry received complaint that a sarpanch and a panchayat secretary withdrew money even though no toilets were constructed in the village. A final report on the inquiry conducted subsequently was yet to be submitted by the state government.
 
 Similarly, gram panchayats in some districts got themselves declared open defecation free (ODF) by the state government on the basis of false and fabricated documents. The union minister instructed the state to investigate the matter in December 2016 but the government was still to submit its reply to the Center.
 
 Other cases cited by the minister in his reply included that the people from Nahriya, Sangod and Syapura villages of Kota district alleged anomalies in distribution of Individual Household Latrine (IHHL) incentive amount.
 
 There were also instances where families tried to mislead the government and attempted to take unauthorised money under SBM. On investigating one such case in Karauli district, the officials found that a complainant,  , had a toilet at home but was demanding the incentive amount in the name of another member of his family against the rules.
