AHMEDABAD: The representative of a Mumbai-based parking management firm has filed a complaint with   police, against a parking manager, for siphoning of Rs 1.89 lakh, the proceeds of two days.

 Vastrapur police said Vinayak Kalambe, regional manager of the Mumbai-based Secure  , has accused Vijay Manekpuri, a resident of Chanakyapuri, in this case. Manekpuri, who has worked for the company working with the firm for a decade, is a native of Badwani, Bihar.
 
 “The company, based in Andheri (E), has contracts to manage parking in western states of India. The firm bagged a contract for Ahmedabad One. Manekpuri used to oversee operations and deposit the day’s proceeds the next day. When a manager checked a report, entries for March 15 and 16 were not made. It became clear that Rs 1.89 lakh had not been deposited,” said an official.
