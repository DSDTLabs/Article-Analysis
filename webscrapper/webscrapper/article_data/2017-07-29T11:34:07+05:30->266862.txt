NAGPUR: Doubles specialists Ritika Thaker and   yet again proved why they are the best pair in the state. They are literally unstoppable, particularly in their age group. 

 Having played together for nearly four years now, the chemistry between the two is just unmatched. The Nagpur-Mumbai duo displayed its perfect combination and stormed into the finals of both the U-17 and U-19 girls doubles categories on the penultimate day of the   State Badminton Championship at the Divisional Sports Complex, Mankapur, here on Friday.
 
 Interestingly, Ritika and Simran pair was not given seeding here as they missed the earlier two state junior tournaments at Parbhani and Karad because of clash with all India junior tourneys.

For a moment, it looked like Pune girls would cause an upset. They were going neck and neck at the break. Egged on by the loud cheering of the home supporters, Ritika and Simran staged a remarkable recovery and stayed in the match by winning the extended second game.
 
 After levelling the games scores 1-1, Ritika and Simran, India No. 1 in U-17 doubles, dominated the decider and won it quite easily to clinch their deserving place in the final.
 
 They will now take on Rashi Lambe (Nagpur) and Kalpita Sawant (Mumbai) in the summit clash on Saturday. Rashi and Kalpita also registered a similar come-from-behind victory against top seeds Arya Shetty and Janhavi Jagtap in the other semis.
 
 In fact, Rashi, who had bagged the double crown in the season opener at Parbhani, is in line for a triple crown having entered the mixed doubles final with his Mumbai partner Akshan Shetty. Unseeded Rashi will face second seed Riya Arolkar in the U-19 girls singles semis. 
 
 Rashi's practice partner Malvika Bansod, winner of historic twin singles titles at Karad, also booked her expected place in both the U-17 and U-19 girls singles semis.
