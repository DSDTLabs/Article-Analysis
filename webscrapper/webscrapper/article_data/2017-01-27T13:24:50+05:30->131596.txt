Lucknow: Prof  , who encouraged Indians to include iodized salt in everyday life, has made it to the list of Padma awardees announced on the Republic Day eve on Wednesday. 

 A faculty in Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences molecular medicine department, Prof Godbole was awarded for his contribution in the area of medicine. “The award has acknowledged my 35-year-long belief that basic science is useless without public interest,” Prof Godbole told TOI. A native of Indore, Godbole left his hometown to take up a PhD programme in All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, in 1970s. In 1980, when he was awarded his degree, he pledged to use his knowledge of organic chemistry for public interest. He undertook several research works to study the impact of iodine deficiency on human health. The work led to policy change and paved way for inclusion of iodised salt in everyday food. 
 
 “The outcomes were recognised by the Union health ministry which launched the   programme in 1986. At that time about 2 in 1,000 children in Terai areas of UP showed mental retardation due to iodine deficiency. The problem is negligible today,” remarked Godbole.
