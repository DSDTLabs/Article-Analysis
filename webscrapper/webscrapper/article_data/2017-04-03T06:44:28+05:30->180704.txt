 “The elevation to this global position is a big opportunity for me to play a significant role in Panasonic’s business strategies,” Sharma told TOI. “The exposure in company’s worldwide operations will also be important for giving a direction to business in India as work here can be aligned to global strategies.” The appliances business is worth nearly $17 billion for Panasonic and Sharma will be a top VP in-charge of shaping global business plans for this division, which will be headed by president Tetsuro Homma. Sharma said that  , the global president of Panasonic, wants to increase participation from regional operations as the company looks at a de-centralised approach to global business development and strategies.
