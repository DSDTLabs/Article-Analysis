Debutant director Nayanasurya’s film Pakshikalude Manam has an interesting theme — it tells the story of a birdwatcher, who is in pursuit of a rare bird. 

 The film is one of the segments of the anthology film  , and stars   in the lead. Actress Shruti Menon was supposed to play the part initially but had to opt out due to unavoidable reasons. “The film tells the story of the birdwatcher before and after her marriage. All her research is focused on one species, pudavachuttikkavadi, and it’s her dream to spot the colourful bird. But she never succeeds and it is believed to be extinct. One day she gets information that the bird has been spotted in a forest and travels to the area with her guru.” However, there’s more to the story than that, Nayana adds. “She and her husband had a love marriage and he agrees to let her pursue her interests after marriage. However, he changes his stance afterwards and does not support her in her pursuit.”
 
 Shoot for the film is over, and Mythili played the part perfectly, she says. “This is my first film, and I faced a lot of roadblocks. But I’m happy that Mythili gave a good performance. She seemed to have a natural connect with the forest.” Nayanasurya has assisted Lenin Rajendran and Dr Biju earlier, among others.
