HYDERABAD: While the   (GHMC) routinely goes to great lengths to rein in property tax defaulters and shore up its revenue, what’s irking residents is the lack of transparency with which this money is spent. Civilians are now demanding that the GHMC budget be audited. An   to this effect was filed on Change.org on Sunday by Malkajgiri resident   and has already garnered many signatories within a day.

 The petition has been addressed to GHMC commissioner B   and state minister for municipal administration and urban development K  . In the petition, Ashwin pointed out how the civic body has been collecting taxes under various monikers such as vacant land tax, property tax and the layout and building regularisation schemes.
 
 “While the people of the city are willing to pay the taxes, there is no audit of the GHMC’s expenditure. Also, we have noticed that most of the money that is paid to the civic body is used only to take up development works along particular roads that are frequented by VIPs,” he said.
 
 He further demanded that the civic body should upload their balance sheet every quarter. “The civic body needs to undergo an internal audit. Also, it should stop giving benefits to its employees and elected representatives who fail to meet their targets,” he said.
 
 The online petition comes at a time when the civic body’s standing committee has given a nod for a budget of Rs 5,643 crore for 2017-18. Of this, it has earmarked capital expenditure of Rs 3,026 crore and revenue spending of Rs 2,616.27 crore.
