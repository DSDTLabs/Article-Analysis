Coming from a theatre background,   is always happy to work with theatre personalities in films. So, when the opportunity to star in Yogesh Master’s   came along, Shruthi was all too happy to jump on board; what also sealed the deal for her was the story. “The movie has a very good message. I play a mother in the   and the movie captures all the emotions of a mother. Every mother wants to be with her child and watch them grow and prosper, but not all get to do that. So, this film is very relevant in today’s society; villages in India today have become like old-age homes as children leave their ageing parents behind and move out in hopes of finding a better life. Marali Mannige explores that through the story of one such mother,” says Shruthi.

 The movie sees her at two different stages of life — one as a young woman and the other as a senior citizen. So, was it a challenge to portray the different roles? “No, since this has become routine for me. When I was around 16 years old, I played the role of a mother of three, and have been playing older characters throughout my career,” she says, adding that what was interesting was the makeover. “I look just like my mother in my older avatar. I kept my mother and her mannerisms in mind during the makeover, which made it easy for me to set into the role of a 60-plus year old woman. I have modelled my look on how my mother dresses, her hairstyle, sari, spectacles, etc. — I copied my mother. I could see just how I would look when I get old,” Shruthi says.
