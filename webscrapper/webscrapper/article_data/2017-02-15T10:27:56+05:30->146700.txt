MADURAI: Stating that the   in   was not right in taking cognisance of the   filed by a Madurai-based couple that actor   was their son, the latter refused to undergo a   to ascertain any fact, as suggested by the   of the  .

 Dhanush had filed a petition seeking to quash the proceedings pending before the judicial magistrate court in Melur based on the case filed the couple - R Kathiresan, 65, of Madurai and his wife Meenakshi, 53, seeking maintenance from the actor by claiming that Dhanush was born to them.
 
 On Tuesday, the case came up for hearing before Justice G Chockalingam, during which, as per an earlier direction the actor’s side submitted a photocopy of his transfer certificate stating that he studied in a private school in Chennai. The couple’s side also filed a certified copy of the transfer certificate saying that their alleged son (the actor) studied Class 10 at the government higher secondary school in Melur. 
 
 After scrutinising the actor’s copy, the judge found that it lacked identification marks of the student (actor) and asked: “Is it possible for the school to provide a transfer certificate without mentioning the student’s identification marks?” 
 
 Besides, the court asked, “May the DNA test be done?” Replying to it, the actor’s side said, “We are saying that the magistrate court in Melur is not right in taking cognisance of the case of the couple. Thus, the question about DNA test doesn’t arise.”
 
 Following it, the court directed both sides to produce original copy of the certificates and adjourned the case to February 17.
