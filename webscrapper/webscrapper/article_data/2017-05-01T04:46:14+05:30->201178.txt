NEW DELHI: As many as 30 Muslim youths from the Kashmir Valley called on BJP president Amit Shah, who is on a three-day visit to Jammu & Kashmir, on Sunday. The youths offered to support BJP’s expansion plan,  . 

 Most of the youths are engineers and their support comes at a time when separatists have been accused of inciting mob violence against security forces. “Most of the 30 youths from Kashmir are engineers or double graduates and their support to the party will be highly valuable,” Shah said on his Twitter account. The BJP chief said the youths had offered to contribute for six months in the party’s expansion drive. “Step taken by these youths is highly encouraging for the party... I wholeheartedly welcome them to the party fold,” he added. 
 
 Shah’s view reiterates his stance that his party has no reservations with the Muslim community and it wants to carry forward the “good governance agenda of the Modi government with the slogan “sabka saath sabka vikas ”. However, party members have made it clear that their agenda is governance and not appeasement for votes. 
 
 The youths’ support to the party came on a day when PM Narendra Modi in his ‘Mann ki Baat’ once again spoke about ending the practice of triple talaq. Party leaders maintained that the support of youths from the Valley was a move in the right direction. They said this was not an isolated incident as large numbers of Muslim youths were turning up for recruitment to security forces, including the state police, which reflected that they were keen to join the mainstream.
