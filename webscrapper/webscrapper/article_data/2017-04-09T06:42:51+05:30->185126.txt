NAGPUR: Around 1,500   activists from 18 states will be meeting in the city on April 12 for a national convention. They will be demanding a new and effective law for clamping a nationwide prohibition. Till that new law is brought, they will seek stricter implementation of the Supreme Court’s orders banning liquor sale within 500 metres of the state or national highway.

 The national convention is organized under aegis of ‘Nasha Mukt Bharat Andolan’ (campaign for addiction-free India) by its convener ex-MLA Dr Sunilam. While eminent social worker Medha Patkar will preside over, Swami Agnivesh,   Assembly’s deputy leader Shyam Rajak, state MLAs B R   and Kapil Patil and several other prominent social workers from across the country will participate.
 
 National People’s Action coordinator Vilas Bhongade said alcohol was a major killer taking a toll of 10 lakh people annually in the country. Of these 20,000 die in Maharashtra. Talking to reporters, he along with Dr Sunilam said they strongly supported the agitation being by women groups across the country against liquor shops. 
 
 “In no case we would allow state governments to circumvent the Supreme Court order restricting liquor sale within 500 meters of state or national highway. Soon after the apex court passed the order, it was found that states got busy in denotifying the highways to beat the ban orders. This is unfortunate,” said Bhongade. They said if states like Bihar, Gujarat,  , Andhra Pradesh can prosper without the excise revenue from liquor trade, there was no reason why Maharashtra could not. 
 On April 12, a peaceful march would start from   at 10am and reach Vasantrao Deshpande auditorium where the national convention would begin at 12 noon. The anti-liquor leaders would discuss action plan for nationwide prohibition. Dozens of social organizations, non-government organizations and social forums are expected to participate in the daylong deliberations.
