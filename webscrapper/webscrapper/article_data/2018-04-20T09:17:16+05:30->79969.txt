MADURAI: The fourth leg of excavation work commenced at   in Sivaganga district, where Sangam-era habitation site was found during excavation works carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). After three phases of excavation works, the fourth leg of excavation was announced by the state government when   wound up its study. 

 After public demand to continue the excavation works grew, archaeology minister,   announced that the fourth leg will be taken up by state archaeological department with guidance from ASI. He also announced that the government will set aside Rs 55 lakh. 
 
 The excavation was expected to begin in February but disputes broke out with local landlords, who refused to provide their lands for excavation. The hurdles had to be cleared with continuous negotiations. 
 
 After the previous landlords were not willing to provide road access to the excavation site, a new dirt track into the coconut groves was created with support of district administration and landlords supporting the works. 
 
 On Wednesday, the ground-breaking ceremony was held at Keezhadi to start excavation works. On Thursday, 50 workers were deployed and four excavation trenches are underway. A seven-member team of archaeologists from the state archaeological department are camping at the site for the task. 
 
 “We will take out excavation till September end. The number of trenches will be decided based on the antiquities and structures we are going to find during our studies,” said an official, not willing to be named.
