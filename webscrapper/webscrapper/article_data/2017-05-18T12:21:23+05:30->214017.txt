The 25-year-old woman had been referred to QMH in the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday in a serious condition of continuous bleeding.

 Her relatives claimed that they had been thrown out of the hospital. They sat on the road with the newborn in their lap. A crowd gathered around them, creating a law and order situation. Initially, the family refused to take the body away. It was only after the police intervened that the aggrieved family agreed to take the body. According to officials of King George’s Medical University (KGMU), the   was brought into QMH with extensive bleeding, jaundice and a fit-like condition for which several attempts were made to save her. 
 
 “There was no negligence on the part of the doctors as all attempts were made to save her but her condition was serious even when she was brought in. Had the patient been here for a few days and then negligence was alleged, it would still have made sense but not in such an emergency case where doctors tried hard,” said Prof NS Verma, KGMUspokesperson.
