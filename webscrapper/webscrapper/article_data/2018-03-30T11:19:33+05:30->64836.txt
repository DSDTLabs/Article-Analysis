GANDHINAGAR: Based on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India that was tabled in the state assembly on Wednesday, the   said that the Gujarat BJP government had committed irregularities worth more than Rs 25,000 crore.

 Chartered accountant and Gujarat   spokesman   said, “The government of Gujarat has not taken annual statement of rates ( ) into consideration for land valuation and registration even after having decided to do so in March, 2012. On instructions of the Gujarat high court, the government planned an annual review of actual market rate for a particular area through surveys and various tools to decide what the annual statement of rates should be consider and by extension for revenue, to decide registration charges and stamp duty. 
 
 To benefit those associated with them, the government of Gujarat failed to apply annual statement of rates from 2012 to 2017. By non-compliance with the annual statement of rates, the government of Gujarat lost approximately Rs 25,000 crore of revenue. The CAG report states that this revenue forgone was about Rs 5,000 crore every year, for the last five years.”
 
 Gadhvi, quoting from the CAG report, further said, “Between 2012 and 2017, a total of 25,46,078 documents were registered at various offices of the revenue department. Out of this, 11,76,442 registrations were done without implementing annual statement of rates, that is about 46% of all registered documents. 
 
 The 13,59,636 documents registered after implementing this thumb rule brought in additional revenue of about Rs 5,000 crore per annum. The increase in revenue with higher rates was about Rs 26,500. Hence the 46% of documents registered without the annual statement of rates were a lost opportunity for revenue of Rs 25,000 crore.”
