For the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards,   chose to wear a stunning white Balmain mermaid creation. As expected, she did manage to turn heads at the event and grab all the attention on social media. However, it is not just that but also what happened at the event that got the Twitterati talking. 

 The Emmy announcer called Priyanka Chopra and   to present the Award for Outstanding Variety Talk Series to John Oliver, but pronounced Chopra as Chopa, missing out the 'R' from Priyanka's surname.
 
  
  
 Not in a mood to spare the announcer for the error, Twitter criticized   online by tweeting about the same. Here are some of the reactions: 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 While Twitter was busy with that, Priyanka Chopra took to her Instagram account to recount the incredible night. She wrote: What a night it's been at the #Emmys... #ShimmyShimmying in @balmain. Congratulations to all the winners, thank you for revolutionizing the world of Television. #ThatKindOfNight So proud of the incredible artists that came together to make tonight epic!

 Priyanka, who rose to fame in the west with her TV show Quantico, attended the annual award gala for the second time. Last year, she presented an award with actor Tom Hiddleston, and was applauded for her fashion sense as she opted for a red chiffon dress and twirled around at her debut appearance.
 
 Priyanka wasn't nominated in any category for the Emmys this year.
