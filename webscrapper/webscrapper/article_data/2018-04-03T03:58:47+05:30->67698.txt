NAVI MUMBAI: Hundreds of   have been dumped over the extended weekend on a sprawl of land barely 10 meters from the mangrove and wetland stretch in   along the abandoned Palm Beach Road extension skirting Thane creek. Debris can also be seen on mangrove patches. The land is close to the plot for the proposed   ( ) sports complex. 

 While just a week ago there was nothing in the area, today there are 20-ft debris heaps. The debris and land mafia took advantage of the recent holidays to turn the land into a dump yard, a source said. 
 
 Locals are worried that debris dumping may continue unless the authorities take note immediately. They are concerned that irreversible damage may be caused to mangroves and wetland, which are ecologically sensitive areas, which not only harbor aquatic life, but also act as rainwater sinks, especially during the monsoon. Mangroves are also essential for maintaining the "integrity of coastlines" by preventing denudation of land by seawater.
 
 Early morning joggers in Ghansoli allege that a person has been seen collecting money from truckers that unload debris. "This shows how ham-fistedly civic officials are dealing with the debris mafia. Several hectares of wetland have been lost to illegal dumping along this stretch. Very soon, the land mafia will grab proper mangroves by expanding dumping," said local activist Santush Patil.
 
 When TOI told Navi Mumbai assistant municipal commissioner Dattatray Nagare about the illegal activity, he said he had "no idea about the dumping". "Nobody has been permitted to dump construction debris on this patch. We had earlier dumped a few trucks of debris inside our proposed sports complex. (The illegal dumping) may be the handiwork of some touts. We will have to check the ground situation by deputing our anti-nuisance squad to ensure further action."
