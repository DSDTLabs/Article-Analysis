PANAJI: In a bid to crack down on illegal transfer and subletting of industrial plots,   ( ) has asked its officers to survey all 21 industrial estates in Goa for industrial plots. The field officers will identify those plots that have been illegally sub-let or transferred. 

 “A memo has been issued to field managers to do a survey of all plots which have been illegally sublet or transferred. I have sought a report in 20 days,” GIDC managing director   told TOI. “A time period of 180 days has been given to units which are subleased to apply to GIDC for regularization. If they fail to do so, we have the option to repossess the plots.” 
 
 Before sealing and repossessing industrial plots, GIDC will issue show cause notices to the promoters of the industrial units asking them to explain or justify the lapse. Only if no response is received will GIDC move to repossess them from their errant promoters.
 
 GIDC has introduced the new Transfer and Sublease Regulations, 2018, which makes it easier for entrepreneurs to sublease unutilized parts of industry plots. With industrial land being in short supply, GIDC hopes that these reforms can allow industrial activity to continue despite land being unavailable.
 
 To make things even simpler and to create a hassle-free interface for entrepreneurs, GIDC also plans to create an online interface for entrepreneurs who will be able to apply for plots, transfer of plots, and other processes.
 
 Gad said that the process had already begun and that in the coming months the online service could begin. “We have already started the work to appoint an agency to develop the digital application process for GIDC,” he said.
