HYDERABAD: Authorities at the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) received a shock on Friday after the irrigation department denied their request to maintain higher water levels at   for city’s drinking water needs. Officials are planning to install emergency pumps at  , a major tapping point to draw Krishna water, to meet the city’s requirement.

 The Water Board had asked for 510feet water at the reservoir for uninterrupted supply to the city in the summer. The Water Board managing director M Dana Kishore had sent a written request to this effect, but was refused by C  , engineer-inchief, Irrigation and Catchment Area Development (I&CAD) saying the water was needed to irrigate standing crops.
 
 “There is a requirement of 22 TMCft exclusively for Telangana ayacut apart from demands of   under ‘Nagarjuna Sagar Left Canal’project,” Muralidhar said. There is also a requirement of about 24 TMCft for drinking water needs under Mission Bhageeratha.
 
 Keeping this in view, water may not be sufficient to maintain level at 510feet, the official said. “The water board has to make necessary arrangements to draw water up to 500feet or even below till onset of monsoon,” he added.
