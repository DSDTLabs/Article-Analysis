VISAKHAPATNAM: The magnificent   centre of the  , built at a cost of 13.5 crore on the scenic beach front in the city, has hosted only three events since its inauguration on December 9 last year.

 While the convention centre was built to serve both the university’s needs and also to rent it out for public utility as a revenue resource, the grand building has so far failed to attract events even on a moderate scale. According to officials, the centre with a seating capacity of 1,800 people and state-of-the-art amenities has hosted two marriage receptions and one Andhra   programme since it was inaugurated on the occasion of the   alumni association meeting presided over by vice-president M   about four months ago.
 
 December to February is the season for various national seminars, workshops and functions in Vizag when the climate is very pleasant. This time around, while star hotels in the port city are busy encashing on the season, the AU convention centre is sans any activity. 
 
 University authorities are attributing the poor response to various factors. According to them, the high 6 lakh per day rent with 18 per cent additional GST and 2 lakh caution deposit could be a deterrent. Others conceded that there is a need to publicise the world-class centre in order to attract big events.
 
 “We have built a fine structure but I think it needs some marketing too. Many event organisers might not be aware and thus holding national and international seminars at nearby star hotels. Our venue is suitable for cinema music pre-release and other functions too,” AU registrar Prof Uma Maheswara Rao told TOI.
