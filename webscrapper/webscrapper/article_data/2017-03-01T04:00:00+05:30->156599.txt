Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court on Tuesday disposed of quashing petitions filed by six constables from Surat after the government made it clear that no offence was made out against them in either prohibition or corruption cases for the hooch tragedy that took place last year.

 Six constables from Surat — Dipak Parbhare, Dipak Chauhan, Vinesh Bhikhubhai, Jayanti Vajirbhai, Rajesh Patel and   — were first booked for abetment in a prohibition case and later under the Prevention of Corruption Act. They were booked after a preliminary inquiry into their call data records revealed they were in contact with the bootleggers.
 
 All six cops moved the HC through advocate   to get the charges quashed. The advocate highlighted how the set procedure was not followed in registering the FIR in this case.
