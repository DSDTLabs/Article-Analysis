Filled with green weeds and choked by litter,   at   was nearing death a few months ago. However, the efforts of 700 residents of the panchayat over 70 days became a life saver for the river as they toiled hard to get rid of the waste and revive the water body.
The river, which is a tributary of the   and  , has not only upped the scenary of the whole village but also helped its 400-strong fishermen community.
 Budhanoor panchayat president   says, “The fishermen community has regained its livelihood. They are back in the river with their nets.”
 Another positive news is that the wells of the houses within a 6 km radius is full with clean water, thereby wiping off the water woes of the panchayat that was the reason for the cleansing attempt in the first place. 
 Viswambaram says that the water body had turned into a dump yard for the past 10 years. “It was once the prime source of irrigation and potable water for the villagers. But illegal sand mining, dumping of wastes turned it into a toxic water body, eventually drying it out,” he says.
 Though the panchayat had submitted several proposals to the government for cleaning the river, it was caught in red tape, alleges Viswambaram. “That’s when in January, 700 people including men and women wholeheartedly cleaned up the river.”
 The 12 km-long river was given a new life by the villagers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act project. “Initially, it was a great hurdle for the people because it had toxic wastes as well as venomous snakes. We provided them safety boots and other medicinal support to escape the itching from polluted water. Once the debris was cleared, we could see crystal clear water from the surface,” he explains.
 With the river now flowing, Viswambaram says, “Life has returned to normal in our area. We hope this becomes an example for others too to protect deteriorating water bodies,” he adds.
