AHMEDABAD: The Regional   at   has decided that only 100 people will be allowed every day to visit the back office with queries. Therefore,   will give only 100 appointments daily.

 “We are introducing the new system of appointments at the back office to manage the crowd load and deliver more responsible and accountable service to people,” said Neelam Rani, the regional passport officer. “We will release 100 appointments per day in different slots for all 17 categories of services given at the Passport Back office ( ).”
 
 Neelam Rani said that beginning from Thursday, the passport office will not allow visitors without appointments. Appointments can be obtained from the website that facilitates appointments at the passport Seva Kendras.
 
 A senior officer said that appointments were introduced to stop people from coming with inquiries that can be easily resolved on the website. Officials said that unnecessary visits not only inconvenienced other visitors but also placed additional burden on the staff.
