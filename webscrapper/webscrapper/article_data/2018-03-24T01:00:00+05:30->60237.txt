Actor  , last seen on the TV show 'Beyhadh', was in for a shock recently, when a female fan slit her wrist and wrote his name in blood on her hand. The woman from   posted pictures of her injured wrist on Kushal’s social media handles. When   contacted the actor, he said, “After my last show ended, many fans wrote to me, saying that they loved my character. Some even said that just like 
 the show’s female lead character — an obsessive lover called   (played by  ) — they, too, can slit their wrist and write letters in blood. I ignored such comments, believing that nobody would go to that extent. However, a week ago, this fan from Saudi Arabia slit her wrist and wrote my name on her hand in blood. She also posted the pictures on my social media accounts. I scolded her on Twitter, saying, ‘This is very uncool. If you are trying to impress me with such dangerous gestures, you are clearly not scoring any brownie points with me.’ I also told her not to repeat it in the future. How can I get impressed with such dangerous 
 gestures?”
 Kushal deleted the woman’s posts soon after as he didn’t want to encourage such behaviour.
