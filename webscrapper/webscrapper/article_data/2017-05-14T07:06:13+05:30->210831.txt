HYDERABAD: At a time when the Centre has reiterated the mandate of speed governors for all commercial vehicles, turns out not a single cab, lorry or private bus in the city is equipped with them. Most of these blatantly indulge in   to make good time and more bucks, say officials. 

 Time becomes a crucial factor in the case of private or aggregator-based cabs and private buses. “At around 8.30-9pm, I get a message from the company (aggregator) saying if I complete another 20 km, I will be eligible for an incentive of Rs 700. Most drivers tend to accept this and speed to make it before the cut-off time,” said   R, a cab driver.
 
 Private buses too try to complete the journey in lesser time to beat their competitors. “While several have been nabbed during special drives, they are not held often due to lack of adequate staff and bus operators go back to speeding,” said a motor vehicle inspector.
