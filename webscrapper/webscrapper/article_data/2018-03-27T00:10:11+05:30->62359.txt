Pune: Toyota Kirloskar Motors (TKM) — the joint venture that manufactures vehicles for the Japanese automaker in India — is gradually rebuilding its base in the city.

 Last year, TKM had pulled out of 11 dealerships in the state, including about half-a-dozen in Pune, run by now beleaguered realty enterprise, DS Kulkarni Developers Limited. The dealerships were run under the brand name of DSK Toyota and it was at the heart of the carmaker’s sales and service strategy in Pune.
 
 Last week, TKM opened a new dealership in Pune on Senapati Bapat Road, under the brand name Shaw Toyota. In the interim, it had started two service centres with its partners, Sharayu and Shaw Toyota. 
 
 The latest one makes it the second sales and fourth service dealership for the TKM brand in the city. The company plans to open another franchise by the middle of 2018.
 
 “New dealerships in Kolhapur, Ahmednagar and Sholapur with existing dealer partners will soon be operational,” N Raja, deputy managing director, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, said. In addition to these places, DSK also ran dealership outlets in Satara, Sangli, Ratnagiri and Kankavali.
 
 Customers, who had purchased vehicles from DSK Toyota, were forced to wait longer to get their vehicles serviced as only two service centres were operational. It particularly affected those, who had free services left as they had to pay to get their vehicles serviced from outside.
 
 DSK Toyota was DS Kulkarni group’s biggest revenue spinner among his group companies. Shirish Kulkarni, DSK Group’s managing director, had told TOI in an interview last year that the group gets Rs 1,200 crore annual revenue from the dealerships.
 
 Sources in the industry said the TKM brand is now looking to diversify its partner base for its dealerships, instead of giving all dealerships to the same partner in a particular region.
