INDORE: A gang of four thieves cut five sandalwood trees from near   vice chancellor’s office on   campus late on Monday.

 The university authorities have complained about the matter with   police. They also approached   police to keep a strict vigil on DAVV RNT Marg campus too. DAVV senior officials said that the same gang was involved in a number of such incidents earlier also. “It is a gang that cut trees and flees away with them. It has been active in the city for the past several years. We had lodged a complaint earlier too,” said VC NK  .
 
 He said that earlier, when the gang members were caught, they had admitted targeting other locations too apart from university campus. They enter and walk on the campus quietly and use handheld saws to cut the trees. Soon as a tree is cut into two, they swiftly take the log out of the campus, Dhakad added.
 
 “The thieves don’t use any modern technique or equipment in slaughtering the trees,” he said adding that how they enter the campus is also being investigated.
 
 According to senior officials of the university, there is a possibility of security personnel’s involvement in the entire episode since no one can enter the campus without their information.
 
 “The gang members are habitual offenders. We are presently investigating the matter and fresh details are expected to surface,” said Bhawarkuan police station in-charge Shivpal Singh Kushwah.
