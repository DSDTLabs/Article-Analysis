They said they killed Nasir and dumped his body after a dispute over a payment of Rs 40,000. Police recovered two mobile phones, a knife and their car in which they had ferried Nasir’s body to Maal to dump it there.
 
 ASP (trans-Gomti)   said the men took Nasir towards Maal while luring him for a drink session. Nasir had parked his bike at a Hasanganj tea stall to join the men. On the way, they kept piling Nasir with liquor and once he was inebriated, they slit his throat over 20 times around 1 am.

They disposed of the victim’s mobile phone, the gamchha and their blood-stained clothes in Gomti at   in Madiaon. Inspector, Hasanganj, UV Singh said, “We collected details of all those Nasir associated with and zeroed in on these two. Their call records and mobiles were also found active at the same place and this gave us clinching evidence against them.”
