COIMBATORE:  , 28, a hearing-and-speech-impaired person from the city, had registered at the employment exchange after completing B.Com five years ago. But, she has not got a response from the office since then. 

 Navodaya was one among the 130 hearing-and-speech-impaired people from the city and surrounding districts, who gathered at the district collectorate seeking government jobs on Monday. They requested the government to fill up the 1% reservation for hearing-and-speech-impaired people in the government sector.
 
 Many among the group had registered at the employment exchange more than 10 years ago. Inbasekaran  , a 28-year-old hearing impaired person, said he had registered six years ago. “Once I got a letter asking me if I was interested to undergo training in sewing. But I was not promised a job,” he said.
 
 While appearing for competitive exams such as the   exam, hearing-and-speech-impaired people are given question papers with the same difficulty as for the normal people, they said. 
 
 “It is unfair to expect us to compete with people, who can hear and talk well. We have our limitations, which have to be taken into account. We should be given relatively easy question papers,” said Aslam.
