Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation is set to widen the bridge on a nullah between University Library Square and   Chowk by spending Rs3.76 crore.

 The work order was issued on September 9, 2015. The delay in carrying out the widening work of 850 metre stretch had increased the project cost from Rs4.74 crore to Rs5.50 crore. At the time of preparing a development plan report of the patch, the NMCâ€™s public works department had failed to include the project.
 
 The department officials had also not included the shifting of electric poles and other cables. All these increased the project cost. Now, the public works department has submitted a proposal of Rs3,76,93,912 to construct the bridge before the standing committee which will meet on January 11.
 
 19 other proposals will also come up for discussion. It includes the setting up of a Smart City office on the seventh floor of the new administrative building. Though the standing committee chairman Sandip Jadhav had earmarked Rs10 crore for the Smart City project, the civic body has prepared a proposal of Rs2.53 crore for the purpose. 
 
 Most of the other proposals pertain to road works worth Rs5.60 crore. The public works department of Dharampeth Zone too has submitted a revised proposal of Rs1.04 crore to renovate Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya.
