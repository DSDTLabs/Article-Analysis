KOCHI: Finally, the decks have been cleared for the construction of super-specialty block in Government Medical College, Ernakulam.

 Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) has given its final nod for Rs 200 crore project for the construction of the super-specialty block and the work may start within two months. The construction of the block was part of the Rs 370 crore development project submitted to the   for final approval. The Rs 370 crore project includes construction of super-specialty block, staff quarters, PG quarters, common amenities centre and indoor stadium cum auditorium and gymnasium. “Of this, KIIFB gave approval for the super specialty-block now. The funds for the remaining projects will be released in a phased manner,” an official associated with the project said.
 
 “Infrastructure Kerala Ltd (INKEL), the nodal agency for the project, can start tender procedures. It would take almost one-and-a-half months for completing the tenders procedures and awarding the work to a firm. The contractor should mobilize equipment and start the work within two or three weeks. So, the work may be started in two months,” the official added.
 
 Last week, the state government had paid Rs 58 crore to   for closing a loan taken by government medical college almost 15 years ago. It was during the period of   (CAPE) as the   college that Ernakulam   gave around Rs 25 crore to the hospital for its development. The principal amount plus accumulated interest touched Rs 90 crore as CAPE didn’t repay any money to the bank. The government had paid Rs 32 crore to the District Cooperative Bank towards the repayment of the loan.
 
 The debt has been one of the major reasons for the delay in getting the final approval of the KIIFB for Rs 370 crore super specialty block project.
