HYDERABAD: Speaking out on the ongoing casting couch controversy, senior producer Allu   on Thursday fired a salvo at filmmaker   for his recent remarks.

 After RGV claimed that it was he who had asked actress Sri Reddy to speak against Jana Sena Party leader  ,   demanded to know if RGV was acting at somebody's behest.
 
 
 “Our family is feeling agrieved at the language that has been used by Sri Reddy. She is 20% at fault for making such remarks, but Ram Gopal Varma is 80% responsible for it,” Aravind said. “These remarks are an attempt to sully the image of Pawan Kalyan. People can make out from the videos posted by RGV and Sri Reddy as to what drama is being enacted," he said.
 
 Responding to other remarks and claims made by RGV that are being played out in public, Aravind said it was unbecoming of Ram Gopal Varma to behave the way he was conducting himself.
 
 Aravind also announced that the Telugu film industry was in the process of setting up a committee that would look into complaints of sexual harassment. While 50% of the committee’s members would be from NGOs, another 50% would be from the film industry with several women members, he said. He added that he would also be part of the committee.
