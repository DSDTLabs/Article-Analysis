KOLKATA: Kolkata and Chennai airports, which were taken off the privatisation list two years ago, may again return to woo suiters if “certain issues“ get resolved, minister of state for civil aviation   said at the   in Kolkata on Monday .“Operations and maintenance of Kolkata, Chennai, Jaipur and Ahmedabad airports were to be handed to private operators. It is happening for Jaipur and Ahmedabad first but Kolkata and Chennai are not completely off the radar.We have not lost hope of appointing a private operator for O&M at Kolkata,“ the minister said.

 When asked about connectivity to Europe and the US from Kolkata, the minister did not sound optimistic and pointed out that it would be determined by viability . “This decision has to be taken by airlines alone. It depends on purely economics and nothing else. Unless there is enough business, there won't be sufficient business-class passengers to make the flight commercially viable,“ he added.
