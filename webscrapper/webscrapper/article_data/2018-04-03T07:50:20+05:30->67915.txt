BENGALURU: An   by a   seeking to   at   on Monday morning ended in a melee after a   took objection to the volunteers’ initiative, abused them and shoved them around.

 A few two-wheeler riders took offence to being counselled on the violations they were indulging in and abused and bashed up some of the volunteers.
 
 Two videos accessed by TOI show the volunteers stopping riders from getting on to footpaths near a traffic signal in BTM Layout, 2nd Stage. They approach them with placards on which are messages like: “I don’t follow rules, I am sorry.” The volunteers are seen requesting the riders to take a selfie with them. While some motorists accept their mistake and cooperate, not all appear to be in a mood for Gandhigiri.
 
 One two-wheeler rider is seen losing his cool and asking the volunteers if they don’t have anything better to do. When the volunteers tell him to follow rules, the motorist snaps back asking why he should do so and says he is only answerable to a traffic cop. The two-wheeler rider is then seen hurling invectives at the volunteers and charging at them menacingly.
 
 The youths said they were out on Monday morning conducting an awareness camp against riding on footpaths and as part of the initiative they were giving away awards to violators and taking selfies with them.
