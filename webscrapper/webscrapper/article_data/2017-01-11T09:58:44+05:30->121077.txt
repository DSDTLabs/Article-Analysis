  :  ,   and son of   HDR Lyngdoh, on Tuesday spoke out on reports of a   at the inn. 

 The inn is believed to be one of the sites of the sexual exploitation of a minor girl by powerful persons, including Mawhati MLA Julius Dorphang. Dorphang had been recently arrested in Guwahati.
 
 Rymmai said he had been cooperating with police and would continue to do so. He added that he would act on suggestions by the police on making his inn safer for women and children.
 
 "We will tighten security to prevent such incidents from occurring again," Rymmai said.
 
 The Thma U Rangli Juki (TUR) and Civil Society Women's Organization (CSWO) had filed an FIR against Rymmai under Section 21 (1) of the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences Act.
 
 On the other hand, manager of the guest house, Edmund Kharir, said the the inn's owners were not involved in any criminal act as they had not applied for anticipatory bail. 
 
 He said the incident had come to light only when police turned up at the guest house and arrested waiter   alias Bhaiti.
 
 "He (Bhaiti) was a trusted employee and had worked at the guest house for more than five years. But we found out that he was the main culprit who took the exploiters to Room 302 without the knowledge of the management," he said.
