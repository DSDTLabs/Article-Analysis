GHAZIABAD: After returning to Indirapuram, 12-year-old   opened up to mediapersons on Sunday about her disappearance from her Shakti Khand-3 house. However, the   by Archie was totally different from the official version of Ghaziabad police.

 When asked about the investigation in the case so far, SHO, Indirapuram police station, Pradeep Tripathi said: “The family members and the girl can believe whatever they want to, but the investigation is being done by us and we will soon find evidences. We still think that the girl   from home after leaving her school work incomplete. We even checked her bag.”
 
 When TOI spoke to Archie at her residence on Sunday, she stuck to her earlier stand which she had narrated to her parents and the police. However, many loopholes are making her story less credible. 
 
 According to Archie, somebody rang the doorbell when her mother had gone out to pick her sister from school. “When I opened the inner door of the flat, a woman was standing outside. She looked into my eyes and told me to open the main gate of the flat by using the key kept on the table, which was visible from the doorstep, and follow her downstairs. I reached down before her, and started running away from her. I was stopped by another woman, who pressed a piece of cloth against my nose, which probably made me unconscious. I do not remember anything after that. I only woke up later in a train. Each time I regained consciousness, they would do the same,” Archie told TOI.
 
 However, Naresh, the laundryman who sits opposite Archie’s house, said he did not see any stranger nearby on the afternoon of February 13, the day Archie disappeared. “We were here all afternoon but we did not see any woman entering the house or leaving it. But my daughter saw Archie running away crying,” he said.
