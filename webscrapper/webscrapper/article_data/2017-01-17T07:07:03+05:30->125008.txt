HYDERABAD: In a unique initiative to keep track of children, especially in large gatherings, the   of Child Rights ( ) has drafted a set of guidelines for all state governments to tag kids. 

 The compulsory tracking system, to be enforced with the help of   (RFID) tags, is an idea borrowed from the draft of International Convention on Protection of Child Rights and will be used in places that witness large congregations. 
 
 RFID is a technology that uses tiny computer chips, smaller than sand, to track people and objects from a distance. These tags, to be fixed on children’s hands, will have their details, that of their parents along with mobile numbers. 
 
 “We are sending the guidelines which need to be followed to states for occasions such as exhibitions, melas and functions that are attended by many children and their parents. These tags will help authorities ensure that no child is separated from parents/guardians or abducted. Children with special needs will be given special treatment,” said Stuti Kacker, chairperson of NCPCR. The tags, priced at a meagre Rs 2, can be placed on the elderly too. The movement of those tagged will be monitored from a control room. 
 
 “At gatherings that draw 50,000 people or more, we are (also) contemplating setting up milk booths. Guidelines will especially talk about compulsory signage at such events that can be easily followed by women and children,” Rupa Kapoor, member of the NCPCR, who prepared the guidelines, said. 
 
 The NCPCR has advised states to get sponsors for the tags in case budgets don’t permit them to buy it in bulk. 
 
 The child tracking system was tested successfully for the first time in Vijayawada during the recent  . “We used about 2,20,901 tags and rescued as many as 80 lost children during the festivities,” said Srujana Gummala, the then sub-collector of Vijayawada.
