More than 200 citizens from all walks of life attended a barefoot rally held at Necklace Road on Sunday morning. The protesters demanded justice for victims of child-rape incidents in the country. 

  
 Organised by ERION (End   in Our Nation), a collective of city-based students along with SHE TEAMS of Hyderabad police, the participants walked from People’s plaza to Jalavihar and back, to sensitise the citizens to speak out against sex crimes.
 
  
  actor Nikhil Siddharth was also present at the event to express solidarity with the protesters. Describing the rape incident as an attack on humanity, Nikhil said, “I don't want to see this kind of protests to happen again in the city, and my wish can be fulfilled only when the government takes strict action to ensure that rapes don't take place.”
