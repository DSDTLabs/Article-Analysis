After a two-year wait, fans finally got to feast their eyes on SS Rajamouli’s epic fantasy-drama ‘Baahubali 2: The Conclusion’ which hit theatres on Friday, April 28, amidst much fan frenzy. The film, which is a sequel to the super hit 2015 film ‘Baahubali: The Beginning’, picked up where the original left off and answered some haunting questions, including the one that assumed mythic proportions – “Why did Kattappa kill  ?”
