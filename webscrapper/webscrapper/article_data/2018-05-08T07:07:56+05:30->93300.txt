PATNA: After introducing city bus service on May 3, the   department now plans to come up with monthly passes for daily commuters. A transport department official said the city bus service may be expanded to other routes like   to Phulwarisharif and Gandhi Maidan to   City.

 Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on Sunday said around 10,000 passengers were travelling in the city buses every day. “On the the third day since the launch of this facility, the number of passengers crossed over 10,000, the estimated number per day from all the 25 buses. This overwhelming response is now expected to increase further as more and more people are getting aware about the facility of new spacious buses,” he said.
 
 The buses are being operated from   to  , covering 21 intermediate stops near Udyog Bhawan, Dak Bangalow, Patna Junction, R-Block, Patna Women’s College, Patna zoo, Bihar Museum and many others. The charges are very nominal, from Rs5 to Rs16.
 
 Pondering over the increasing demand, the department is planning to expand the routes for the buses. The new routes will include Gandhi Maidan, Patna City, Phulwarisharif and AIIMS. “The regular commuters, including students and office-goers, are demanding for monthly passes. So, after observing the current route for 15 days, we will launch monthly passes for the ease of the commuters. Depending upon the response of passengers, the routes will also be increased,” said Agarwal.
 
 “The 25 buses being run have the capacity to accommodate 50 passengers at a time. Average revenue earned in a single day is Rs90,000,” Agarwal said.
 
 A group of students from Patna Women’s College said they used to face lots of problem due to unavailability of transport. “The previous buses were very small and congested and we never even thought of entering those buses. But now, with 50% seats reserved for women, these buses have added to our comfort while travelling,” said Triptee Verma, one of the students.
