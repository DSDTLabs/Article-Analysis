KORAPUT: The   sweeping the district has not spared the   known for its  ,  . 

 Major tourist spots like Duduma waterfall, Onkadeli weekly market, Gupteswar, Sabara Srikhetra, Kolab reservoir and the Jain monuments of Subai are wearing a deserted look this season. 
 
 On Tuesday, Jeypore recorded 40Â°C. High humidity and a strong breeze did not even spare places like Laxmipur, Pottangi, Semiliguda and Nandapur, which were once believed to be the coolest parts in the district. 
 
 According to official figures, the number of tourists, including foreigners, visiting the district during this time of the year has come down by 30% to 40% compared to third week of May in 2016. 
 
 "Last year in May around 12,000 tourists visited the district. But this time there has been a drastic drop. The heat wave is unexpectedly high this year and it could be a reason for tourists skipping their visit to the area," said Buddhadev Budula, statistical assistant at the district tourist office, Koraput.
 
 The tourism department is completely unprepared to face the situation. It has made no effort to put up temporary rest sheds and drinking water facilities like 'jala chatras' at the tourist spots. 
 
 Barring Gupteswar not a single tourist spot has safe drinking water facilities. 
 
 A decline in tourist flow has affected the hotel industry and tribal economy. "Many rooms remain unoccupied. We expect the situation to get better in the next 10 days," Sam Naidu, manager of a leading hotel in Jeypore. Officials at the district emergency centre said though the soaring heat is making condition worse for the people, no sunstroke deaths have been reported.
