MEERUT: A massive security apparatus involving police, paramilitary forces and Army was on guard to ensure safety during   beginning Monday, in which over 25 lakh devotees are expected to criss-cross the city. 

 For “watertight” security, two companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF), five of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and one of   (SSB) were deployed at   alone, where over 30 thousand believers are likely to come.
 
  On Sunday, senior police officials took a stock of the security arrangements.
 
  Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Manzil Saini took a meeting and gave instructions to the heads of various agencies to ensure smooth flow of the yatra as lakhs of devotees will spill out on roads for the next two weeks.
 
  The intelligence agencies have already warned of a “lone wolf” attack on the devotees participating in the yatra.
 
  According to information provided by police in Haridwar, a total of 3.24 crore devotees had reached the holy city last year to collect water from the Ganga River.
 
  This year, an estimated 25 lakh devotees are expected to pass through Meerut alone, according to Army officers. And close to 10 lakh may congregate at Augharnath Temple, where ‘jalabhishek’ (a ritual) takes place on Shivratri.
 
  In a recently held meeting in Meerut, UP’s principal secretary (Home) Arvind Kumar had said: “This year, we have an estimate that close to 4 crore devotees will reach Haridwar from various districts of UP, Haryana and Rajasthan.”
 
  SP city Mann Singh Chauhan, who is the nodal officer for arrangements, told TOI, “Our main focus will be on Augharnath Temple on Monday. We have deployed two companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF), five of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and one of Seema Suraksha Bal (SSB) around the temple.”
 
  Meanwhile, the Army has also deployed its units outside the temple to provide watertight security.
