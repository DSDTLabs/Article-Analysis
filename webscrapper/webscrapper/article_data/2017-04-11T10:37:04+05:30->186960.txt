HYDERABAD: Barely a day after sanitation workers called off their strike at  , government hospitals are staring at another crisis with the   (TGDA) launching a stir with their demands from Monday.

 While doctors wore black badges to work and held dharnas outside the administrative building before their office hours so that out-patient facilities are not disrupted, they have vowed to intensify the strike by boycotting duties for an hour from May 1 and completely boycotting duties from May 16 and boycott all services from June 2 onwards, if their demands are not met.
 
 The strike notice was served to the state health minister and other authorities in the health department on March 23. “We have represented the genuine demands of government doctors a number of times but not a single demand has been met so far. This is creating insecurity and apprehension in the minds of the doctors,“ said Dr S Ramesh, president of the TGDA.
 
 Apart from implementa tion of University Grants Commission (UGC) pay grades as per GO 14 for university teachers and pending promotions, one of the key demands of the agitating doctors is proper distribution of Telangana and Andhra doctors. Currently, there are 171 doctors from Andhra Pradesh who are serving in medical colleges and govern ment hospitals in the state of Telangana.
 
 “The Telangana government will not accept doctors from AP. They should work under the Andhra Pradesh government,“ read the representation given to authorities at the health department.
 
 The protesting doctors also wanted the previous system of procurement of drugs and disposables followed by individual hospitals, superintendents and District   ( )s to be put in place and have demanded that the Telangana State Medical Services Infrastructure Development Corporation (TSMIDC) be done away with. They have blamed procurement of sub-standard drugs by the TSMIDC. They have also demanded upgradation of infrastructure and manpower at primary health centres (PHC)s.
