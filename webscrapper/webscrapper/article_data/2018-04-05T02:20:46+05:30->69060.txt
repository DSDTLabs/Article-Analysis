SAN BRUNO: An Iranian-born woman who blogged about veganism and believed You-Tube was suppressing her videos opened fire at the company's California headquarters because she was angry with the site's policies, police said on Wednesday.

 In a series of Persian and English-language online postings,  , 39, railed against YouTube, the video-sharing site owned by  's Google before wounding three people and killing herself.
 
 "It is believed that the suspect was upset with the policies and practices of YouTube. This appears to be the motive for this incident,"   chief Ed Barberini said. He added Aghdam did not appear to have targeted particular victims when she opened fire with a hand gun at the open-air plaza.
 
 In some of Agdham's online posts before the attack, she spoke about herself in heroic terms for surviving in a hostile world. "I think I am doing a great job," she wrote in Persian on her Instagram account. "I have never fallen in love and have never got married. I have no physical and psychological diseases. But I live on a planet that is full of injustice and diseases."
 
 In an English-language video posted to her YouTube account before the channel was deleted on Tuesday, Aghdam said, "I am being discriminated. I am being filtered on YouTube."
 
 "There is no equal growth opportunity on YOUTUBE or any other video sharing site, your channel will grow if they want to!!!!!" 
 
 One victim, a man in his 30s, remained in San Francisco General Hospital in serious condition on Wednesday, the hospital said. Two others who had been wounded had beenreleased, it said. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in a tweet that the firm would "come together to heal as a family".
