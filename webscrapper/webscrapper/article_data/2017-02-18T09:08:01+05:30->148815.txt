INDORE: Charged up by   at one go, students of one of the oldest tech colleges in the country are preparing to make their own satellite and launch it in just two years.

 The Indore-based Shri Govind Sekasaria Institute of Technology and Science (SGSITS) has already arranged Rs 2 crore to put the  , thanks to enthusiastic donations from alumni.
 
 SGSITS, which was set up in 1952, is setting up a team that will be trained by  . The college is affiliated to Rajiv Gandhi Prodyogiki Vishwavidhyalaya, MP’s tech university.
 
 SGSITS has initiated the process of selecting the 80-odd members, including students and teachers, who will work on the project. “The recent launch of 104 satellites has generated tremendous enthusiasm among students, who want to be involved in the project. We received hundreds of applications for this project, but have narrowed it down to 80,” Prof.  , director of SGSITS, told TOI.
 
 A two-day workshop began for the team on Friday. ISRO scientists, current and former, introduced the probable team members to satellite launch and monitoring, focusing on material designing and meeting power requirements. Four lectures were organized on Friday and an equal number slotted for Saturday.
 
 The team will be taken around ISRO’s Bengaluru centre and trained by the core team of three other institutes —IIT-Bombay, PES University Bangalore and College of Engineering Pune — that can boast of having put satellites in space.
 
 that have experience of putting satellites in orbit. SGSITS has also involved two school students and their physics teachers to be a part of the group and to study the making of the satellite.
 
 If the team succeeds, it will be a first for the state. Eight institutes have done this — IITs of Kanpur and Mumbai, Chennai’s Anna University, SRM University and Satyabhama University, Bengaluru’s Nitte Meenakshi Institute and PES University, and Pune’s College of Engineering.
