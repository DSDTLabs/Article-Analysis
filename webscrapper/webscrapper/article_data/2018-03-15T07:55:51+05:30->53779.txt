SURAT: It was a real test of grit for 15-year-old  , who faced the   of his life. And, he passed with flying colours. 

 World came crashing down for this class X student living in Rander as he lost his father Rajkumar, who died of sudden heart attack on Tuesday. The family decided to hold the cremation on Wednesday as they waited for close family members to arrive from Uttar Pradesh. 
 
 Harsh’s neighbours in Krushnakunj Society, where he lives, convinced him and brought him to the examination centre at Presidency School. Though he was not in the frame of mind, he decided to write the science paper. 
 
 “Harsh sat for full three hours. But in the last few minutes, he lost control over his emotions and cried inconsolably. It was an extremely poignant moment for everyone. Me and other schoolteachers tried to boost his confidence and encouraged him to appear in the remaining papers. He did well in today’s science paper,” principal of Presidency School Dipika Shukla said. 
 
 Harsh, a student of Shanti Niketan School, answered all questions and sat for complete three hours. His family is from Agra and their financial condition is also not very good, school authorities said. His father was a tailor.
 
 After the exam was over, Harsh reached home and the funeral procession of his father was taken out. Among the three siblings, Harsh is the only son and as per rituals only he could light the pyre.
