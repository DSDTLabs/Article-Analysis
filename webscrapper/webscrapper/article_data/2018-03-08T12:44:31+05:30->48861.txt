CHANDIGARH: Illegal dumping of construction debris at vacant plots continues in various sectors of the city despite a number of complaints from the residents.

 During a visit to various sectors in the city, including 25, 34, and 44, on Wednesday, the TOI team found a lot of debris gathered at unauthorised dumping spots around residential areas. The residents have complained to the area supervisor a number of times but the latter has taken no action on the issue. The municipal corporation rules say that disposing of construction debris in a specified area will invite heavy fine.
 
 Sector-44 resident welfare association (RWA) president   said: “We made a lot of complaints to the area councillor and the   as well but except a temporary arrangement for clearing debris off the road, nothing much was done. In the past few years, the problem has increased a lot. More residents are disposing of their debris at these plots over the past decade and have never faced any action.”
 
 Residents say that sending road clearning machinery into the area gives them no relief. Nirmal said: “In order to get rid of the debris, the administration should come out with a special project for Sector 44.” MC’s former road committee chairman   said: “Last year, the committee recommended a number of challans for the disposal of debris at illegal sites. The officials concerned should visit the affected areas and get the dumps removed.”
