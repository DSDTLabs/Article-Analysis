 The two tracks are titled,   and  , and in the second one, he raps about the 48-year-old songstress. The lyrics go, "2010 was when I lost my halo / 2017 I lost a J. Lo / A Rotterdam trip had me on front page, though."
 
  Reportedly, Drake may be referring to a January 2017 tabloid story that included photos of him with a woman having a meal at a restaurant in the Netherlands.
 
  It is not the first time. Drake earlier rapped about her in his 2017 track  . The lyrics in that said, "I drunk text J. Lo / Old numbers so I bounce back / Boy Wonder gotta bounce back."
 
  The two dated for couple of months until early 2017.
