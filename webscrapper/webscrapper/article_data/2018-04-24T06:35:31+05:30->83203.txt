BENGALURU: This time, Bengalureans will have to wait longer to savour their favourite  . The fruit of the season is usually available in good number in Bengaluru markets by April first week, but this time there has been a delay. 

 Horticulture department officials said various varieties will arrive only from the first week of May. The delay is attributed to late flowering of mango trees. The extended rainfall during the end of last year disturbed the flowering pattern. The yield is also expected to go down by 25%, they added.
 
 K M Parashivamurthy, additional director (flowers and fruits), the department of horticulture, said the state received unusual rains in December which prolonged the flowering of trees. “Some mangoes are available in the market, but they are not sweet. Farmers might have plucked them early and ripened them artificially to make some quick bucks,” he added.
 
 Bengaluru gets most of the mangoes from Kolar and Chikkaballapur districts. Some varieties come from Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu too. “Usually the supply from AP arrives first and Tamil Nadu varieties come towards the end of the season,” he added.
 
 Price may go up
 
 An official with the Horticultural Producers’ Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society Ltd (Hopcoms) said the cost of mangoes may go up by about 25% in May. “However, it may come down once it starts raining. Usually, the demand for mangoes goes down during rainy season. Also, it’s difficult for traders to store fruits,” he added.
 
 Mango mela delayed?
 
 The annual mango mela, organised jointly by the horticulture department and Karnataka State Mango Development Marketing Corporation at Lalbagh Botanical Gardens, may also get delayed this time. It was held for 20 days from May 5 last year. “This year, it is expected only after the second week of May,” said an official.
