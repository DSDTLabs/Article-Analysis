CHANDIGARH: Two women had their legs crushed when a drunken man drove a Mahindra Scorpio   (sports utility vehicle) into the roadside shanty of six sleeping labourers around 2.30am on Thursday at a T-point in the Industrial Area Phase I.

 
 
 
  
 
 
 Driver Gurmeet Singh of Patiala was arrested and, later, released on bail, station house officer (SHO) concerned Zahid Parvez Khan has said. The injured women were moved to the Sector-32  , and discharged after treatment. 
 
 Sunil Kumar, brother of injured women Rupali (22) and Neha (19), said: “The car banged into an e-Sampark sign, uprooted a street light pole, and hit five two-wheelers parked on the pavement before flying off into the shanty.”
 
 Sunil along, fellow auto-rickshaw driver Paramjit Singh ‘Rahul’, and their children were in a shanty behind the one run over. Sunil’s mother, along with two more women, was asleep inside a roadside kiosk where they sell husk pads for room coolers. The group woke upon hearing a bang and saw the Scorpio crash into the sisters’ shanty. Brick splinters from the street light pole’s broken pedestal flew past Sunil’s sleeping mother. The sloshed driver just carried on cutting though obstacles. People from the other   said the driver had reversed his SUV to flee when one of its tyres burst and the wheel got jammed. A crowd gathered around the driver and thrashed him. Industrial Area Phase I SHO inspector Zahid Parvez Khan said: “We have booked Gurmeet Singh under Sections 279 (rash driving) and 337 (causing injuries by endangering the life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 185 (drink driving) of the Motor Vehicle Act.”
 
 In August 2015, a truck driver had run labourers over in the Sector 26 transport area. Four labourers from a family of Rajasthan and another from Uttar Pradesh were killed. The truck driver was consumed by revenge and he had mistaken these innocent men for his targets.
