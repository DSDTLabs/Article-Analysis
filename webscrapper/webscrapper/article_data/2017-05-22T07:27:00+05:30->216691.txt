GURUGRAm: Khalid, one of the   in the   kidnapping case last year, tried to commit suicide by cutting himself on the neck on Friday morning, the police informed.

 Khalid, 20, a resident of Bahin in Palwal, had been lodged in jail in connection with the kidnapping of the then SHO of DLF police station, Surinder Singh Phogat. On Friday, he was brought from Bhondsi jail, and held in a lockup inside the court premises when he tried to cut himself on his neck with a broken shaving  , which he had on him.
 
 The guards, who were accompanying Khalid and other accused, were outside the lockup room. The other accused alerted the police when they saw blood flowing out from Khalid’s neck.
 
 Khalid was immediately taken to the General Hospital in Civil Lines, where he was treated for his injuries. He has been sent back to Bhondsi jail after being discharged on Saturday.
 
 “We have registered a case of attempt to suicide under section 309 of the IPC, and will take him on production warrant for further questioning in the coming week,” said Inspector Rajpal, SHO of the Shivaji Nagar police station, where the FIR has been registered.
 
 Khalid was part of a gang, who were arrested last August, after they kidnapped SHO Surinder Singh Phogat near Galleria market on July 1 in 2016. Surinder had apparently foiled the plans of a bunch of thieves who were trying to steal a car, and was taking the four men to the police station for questioning in his private Swift car, when the three men sitting at the back overpowered him, and drove him around after putting him in the car boot. They eventually dropped him outside the brick kiln near Mathura, and drove away.
