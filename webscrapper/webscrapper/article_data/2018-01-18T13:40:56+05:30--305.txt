HYDERABAD: Two years after the death of   research scholar   Vemula, Cyberabad police are waiting for the ‘right time’ to quietly bury the case by filing a closure report as they have reportedly come to the conclusion that “it was a case of suicide”.

 To buy time, police claim they wrote a letter to   government seeking its opinion on an AP government report clarifying Rohith’s caste. The report had said he belonged to the Vaddera caste, a Backward Classes community. Armed with forensic laboratory report, the Guntur collector’s report, statements of witnesses and others, the police have reportedly come to the conclusion that it was a case of suicide.
 
 Till date, police have not questioned any of the highprofile accused, including UoH vice-chancellor   and former Union minister  .
 
  
 “This is a clear case of suicide. With Guntur collectorate officials clarifying that Rohith was not from Schedule Caste community, discrimination aspect would have to be dropped. We are just waiting for the right time to conclude the case by filing the closure report. Since it is a highly-sensitive issue, which will have ramifications, we are proceeding with great caution,’’ a credible source in the Telangana police told TOI.
 
 A couple of months ago, police almost decided to file the closure report, but then assistant commissioner of police ( ) Ramana Kumar, who was the investigating officer, was transferred in a major reshuffle.
 
 After Rohith’s suicide January 17, 2016, police booked Dattatreya, Appa Rao, BJP MLC Ramchander Rao and others under SC&ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Section 306 (Abetting commission of suicide) of the IPC.
