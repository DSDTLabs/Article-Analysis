TRICHY: A  , found wandering in a   in a village near Thanjavur, created a flutter on Wednesday. Sighting a   is not uncommon for residents living along the  , Kollidam, but it is rare to spot a crocodile at your door step.

 Vincent and his family were shocked to see a fully grown crocodile right at their doorstep, early on Wednesday morning. Vincent immediately alerted the fire and rescue services personnel. Firefighters rushed to the spot and rescued it with the help of locals. Meanwhile, the forest department personnel were informed about the incident.
 
 A tank near Vadugakudi has a few crocodiles and it could have come from there, said forest personnel. The tank, fed by the Kollidam river, always had some water but this year it had gone bone dry, prompting these reptiles to enter villages in search of water.
 
 It could have come during the night when there is no movement around the tank and in the village. The villagers have been asked to remain cautious while going out in the early morning hours.
 
 Forest department personnel released the crocodile at Mukkombu near   where the Cauvery and Kollidam Rivers meet.
