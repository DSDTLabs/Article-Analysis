 "Gauri's killing was meticulously planned and her killers were following her for a long time. We strongly suspect that the assailants must have lived somewhere in RR Nagar so that they could watch her movements regularly. We have already deployed a team of officials, including women police, to interact with residents of RR Nagar," SIT sources said.
 
 Calls to the helpline, set up by SIT inviting leads from the public, have drastically come down. From scores of calls a day, the number is now down to less than 10 over the last couple of days.
 
 "We are looking for evidence, clues and leads. We hope people call us to give evidence and leads, not suggestions," the SIT sources.
