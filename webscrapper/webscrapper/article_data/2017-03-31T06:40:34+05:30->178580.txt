NASHIK: The civic administration began hacking trees obstructing road widening, attracting the wrath of   who had filed a petition against it. 

 City engineer U B Pawar said altogether 350 trees were felled during the day. “Those trees were obstacles to the road. We removed only the trees that were in the carriageway where there is asphalt and traffic,” he said. 
 
 “We took two years to comply with the HC orders. We did not hurry with our action. We made all compliances, submitted an affidavit to the HC and then carried out the tree cutting process,” Paward added.
 
 The   had filed a PIL (41/2006) against the   (NMC) and other government departments against illegal tree hacking. In its judgment on May 2, 2014, the HC permitted the   to cut trees that were obstructing the road widening and asked it to transplant the rest, conduct a census and plant trees. 
 
 Around 1145 trees were found hindering widening of various main and ring roads across the city, out of which 770 trees were saved after conducting a survey. NMC officials said that they transplanted 232 trees and conducted census of 8.50 lakh trees till now. The remaining 375 trees are in process of being cut. NMC also claimed that out of the 21,000 trees 20,000 of 10 feet height were already planted. 
 
 “The HC order states that as many trees as possible should be saved as divider on roads. Few months back I stopped cutting of trees by complaining to the Gangapur police station. If the NMC was interested then they should have measured the roads with us,” said Bhat. “The petitioner is supposed to be informed as per the high court’s order for conservation of trees but they did not inform me about the tree hacking,” said Bhat. 
 
 She said neem, mango and ficus varieties have also been cut on Peth Road and the HC had forbidden cutting of ficus trees.
