NASHIK: On account of World   Day, celebrated on April 2, V-Excel   along with Hausla – an NGO working for disabled children, will organise a   on Sunday to create awareness about the neurodevelopmental disorder.

 Regional director of V-Excel Educational Trust Jayanthi Vishwanathan said, “Autistic children are very bright but their talent is not recognized. We want them to be included in regular schools but children too need to work hard. We have four autistic students who are very bright.”
 
 She added that last year they also conducted vocational   for these students and were trying to bring them into the mainstream but for that people should be aware of such cases.
 
 The rally will start from Sheetal Society at Takli Phata Road and proceed towards Dwarka. The participants will display placards about the disorder to create awareness among the audience. 
 
 Nashik municipal commissioner Abhishek Krishna will be the chief guest of the programme.
