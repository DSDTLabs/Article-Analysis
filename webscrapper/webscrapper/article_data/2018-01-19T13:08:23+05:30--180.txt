 Reportedly, In his response the filmmaker has accused Farrow of 'cynically' using  's Time's Up movement to renew her claims of sexual assault.
 
 "When this claim was first made more than 25 years ago, it was thoroughly investigated by both the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Yale-New Haven Hospital and New York State Child Welfare. They both did so for many months and independently concluded that no molestation had ever taken place... Dylan's older brother Moses has said that he witnessed their mother relentlessly coaching Dylan, trying to drum into her that her father was a dangerous sexual predator."
 
 "It seems to have worked and, sadly, I'm sure Dylan truly believes what she said. But even though the Farrow family is cynically using the opportunity afforded by the Time's Up movement to repeat this discredited allegation, that doesn't make it any more true today than it was in the past. I never molested my daughter as all investigations concluded a quarter of a century ago," Allen said in a statement.

However, in light of the allegations against  ,  , and other men in Hollywood, Farrow penned an op-ed in a publication that called out actors who have worked with Allen and not denounced him over her claims.
