While the movie has been doing the rounds across the country and abroad, the team of   has another reason to celebrate. The   song from the film has received over 1.7 cr hits  , becoming the only Kannada song to get over 1 crore views on a popular video-sharing website. And, understandably, music composer B   is on cloud nine.

 'I never thought that this song would become such a big hit, but Rakshit (Shetty, the lead actor) was confident about it from the beginning. With Belageddu, everything worked to make it a hit ' the tune, lyrics, camerawork, choreography; it was a blend of all these things,' says Ajaneesh, adding that the catchy chorus has caught the fancy of many, including kids. 'People have done covers of the song, which includes a sad version. It's popular on Dubsmash as well. The appeal is such that people from other states are also viewing the song. The film fraternity in Tamil Nadu, for instance, has been congratulating me for it. I feel honoured,' the composer signs off.
