  Referred to NSCN(I-M) leader Thuingaleng Muivah's reported comment that the Framework Agreement signed with the Centre promises integration of all Naga territories, CPM general secretary   wondered why Prime Minister   does not release the full text of the Accord to bring out the truth. 
 
 "Muivah claims that the Framework Agreement that Modi signed with him promises integration of all Naga territories. But we can't verify it. Why have the terms of the Accord not been released for two years? Why doesn't the PM release the full text to bring out the truth?" Yechury asked on Twitter. 
 
 Muivah had reportedly said earlier this week that ' ' will have Naga-inhabited areas in Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh as part of the larger Nagaland state as per the agreement signed on August 3, 2015.
