Rajkot: The Congress on Thursday proposed opening of the audience gallery which has remained closed for general public since past one year. However, the proposal was rejected by a majority vote with 28 Congress corporators favouring it and 37 BJP corporators opposing it. Congress corporator Atul Rajani later said, “I wanted to bring it on record that BJP doesn’t want to open the audience gallery. We are planning to file a PIL on this issue.” Some activists also protested outside RMC demanding that the gallery be opened for public. 

 Activist Ashok Patel said, “According to the BPMC Act, citizens have right to witness the proceedings of the general board. I have made representation to CM and chief secretary about it.” Mayor Jaiman Upadhyay said, “We are not going to open that gallery because there is no general public but only Congress workers who create ruckus.” tnn
