Nagpur: Bharatiya Kamgar Sena has levelled allegations of financial irregularities against Travels Time — one of the three Red Bus operators.

 A press release issued by BKS city president Bhaurao Rewatkar and others stated that as per law, 12% of an employee’s salary should be deducted as contribution towards employees’ provident fund (EPF). The employer has to pay an equal amount as its contribution.
 
 “The 12% contribution of employees of Travels Time comes to Rs1,131 per month per head. However, the firm deducts only Rs168 per month and contributes an equal amount to EPF from company’s side. There are 320 employees in the company. Thus, the operator is embezzling Rs6.16 lakh every month and the amount for last six months is Rs36.97 lakh,” stated the release.
 
 Travels Time has been running city buses since the last 14 months. During this period, the embezzled amount is around Rs One crore, BKS alleged.
 
 A BKS delegation led by former corporator Bandu Talvekar met EPFO Animesh Mishra and appraised him about the issue. Following the complaints, the EPFO office has convened a meeting with NMC officials on April 5, said Talvekar.
 
 Deputy chairman of NMC’s transport committee Pravin Bhisikar expressed shock over the allegations and directed the transport department to look into it.
