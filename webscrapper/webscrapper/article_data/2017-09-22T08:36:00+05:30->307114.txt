Ponda: In what police suspect to be a “premeditated attack”, a 16-year-old   student of a   school stabbed his senior outside the school’s premises on Thursday afternoon, during after school hours.

 Terming the motive behind the attack as frivolous, Ponda DySP Sunita Sawant said, “The accused was afraid that the victim would complain about an earlier incident involving firecrackers, which the victim had recorded on his mobile phone.” 
 
 Police sources said the 17-year-old class XII student has sustained two   injuries to his abdomen and is presently undergoing treatment at the Goa medical college and hospital. The victim’s condition is stable and he is out of danger, police said
 
 The accused has surrendered, but has not been arrested as he is a juvenile, police said, adding that since the accused had carried the knife with him to school it is suspected that the attack was planned. Police have registered an offence against the   under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC.
 
 “The incident occurred outside the campus. We are shocked. The school has provided police with all information,” the school’s principal said.
 
 Ponda PI Sudesh Naik said that the knife has not been recovered and added that the accused has informed the police that he discarded the weapon while fleeing the incident spot.
 
 Ponda PSI Nelson Colaco is investigating the matter.
