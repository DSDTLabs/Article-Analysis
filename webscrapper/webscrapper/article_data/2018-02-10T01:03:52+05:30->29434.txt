NAVI MUMBAI:   residents are not exactly moved by the enthusiasm of the civic body in keeping the city clean for the ongoing  . According to the residents, the sudden absence of hawkers in various parts of Vashi is just a temporary measure to appease the swachh team that is currently surveying the city.

 “I have complained about the hawkers who onlt only sell eatables on the street but also cook in public places but there was no action taken. However, now that there is a team surveying the city for the Swachh Bharat competition all the hawkers seem to have suddenly disappeared,” said a resident of sector 9, Rohit Malhotra.
 
 “My suspicion that this is merely a temporary arrangement was confirmed when I met one of the women who sell eatables regularly in this node. The ward office has reportedly instructed them to not do business for the next few days as the survey is going on,” said Malhotra.
 
 Hawkers are a common sight in parts of sectors 4, 9 and even besides Father Agnel’s Institute and adjacent to  . “If the administration can bring about such a change to win a competition then why can’t it be done on regular basis? Apart from the survey days the hawkers are doing brisk business and the surrounding areas remain littered,”said another resident Shekar Patil.
 
 When contacted the ward office denied allegations of settling for a temporary arrangement with the vendors and described the action that is being taken against the hawkers as a routine process. 
 
 “There is no such instruction given to hawkers. Besides, the survey is for cleanliness and not about hawking. Hawkers are not allowed to sit on the main road and those selling goods in the interior areas are rounded up during our drive,” said ward officer Mahendra Singh Thoke.
