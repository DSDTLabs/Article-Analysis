LUCKNOW:   will offer BA (Hons) in eight subjects from the academic session 2017-18. BA (Hons) will now be offered in English, economics, Hindi, psychology, social work, political science, public policy and ancient Indian history. The decision was taken in the admission committee meet held on Friday.

 “The university, so far, was offering honours   in English, social work and public policy but the annual system of examination was being followed in these courses. The structure of the courses was more or less like the regular BA courses. Now, all BA honours courses, including the above three, will have a new pattern and semester system from the new academic session,” said vice-chancellor SP Singh. 
 
 “In a new set-up, 70% curriculum taught will be helpful in the preparation of civil services and various competitive examinations, while 30% curriculum will be research-based,” Singh said. All the BA (Hons) courses will have 60 seats each.
