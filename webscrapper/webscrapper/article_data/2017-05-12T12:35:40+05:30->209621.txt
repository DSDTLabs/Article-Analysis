PATNA: Leader of opposition in legislative council and former deputy CM   on Thursday met   of state for forests and environment   to apprise him about the violation of   in the construction of a mall near Saguna Mor in Patna.
 
  According to Modi, the mall is coming up on a plot owned by Lara Projects Limited Liability Partnership, an alleged shell firm run by the family of RJD chief Lalu Prasad.
  
  Modi later submitted a memorandum as well to the joint secretary in Union environment and forests ministry. Modi alleged the mall being developed over an area of Rs 7.66 lakh square feet had not been issued environmental clearance by state- level environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA), but construction work was underway for more than a year now.
  
  “As per the norms, environmental clearance is required to be taken from the Union forest ministry for any construction over an area above Rs 2 lakh square feet. However, no such clearance was taken in case of this mall. The SEIAA was supposed to take cognizance of the matter and report it to the Union forests ministry.
 
  The state government is also not lodging an FIR against the construction of the mall because deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is younger brother of forest and environment minister Tej Pratap Yadav,” Modi told TOI over phone from Delhi.
