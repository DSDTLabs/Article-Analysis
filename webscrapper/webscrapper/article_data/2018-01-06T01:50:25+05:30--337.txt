Mumbai:   in  , which has always been in the forefront to provide cooked meals to Mumbaikars stranded owing to floods, waterlogging or public disturbance, will celebrate its   on Saturday.

 The shrine, which started as a humble help centre for victims of the 1968 Koyna earthquake, now counts among the most prominent   in the city. Its foundation stone was laid on Guru Gobind Singh Jayanti on January 6, 1968, by Baba Jeevan Singh Kar Sewa Wale.
 
 Former secretary Pavitar Singh said, “The shrine was a shack measuring 10ftx12ft before we purchased the adjoining huts and additional land. The existing structure was built in 2003. From a time when we could barely manage funds for sustaining the langar, we now run a multi-specialty clinic, ambulance service, library, computer and tailoring classes, kirtan and gatka (the Sikh martial art) lessons. Books are distributed to needy students every year. Nearby Antop Hill is the main beneficiary. Approximately 500 people arrive for langar meals twice every day and tea is served around the clock.”
 
 Hundreds line up to pray and perform kar seva on special occasions like Guru Nanak Jayanti, Lohri, amavasya and purnima. Donations arrive from all parts of Mumbai, even Delhi and Amritsar. 
 
 Leading ragis (singers) will perform naam simran (holy chants) and bhajan-kirtan over the weekend. Blood donation camps and community langar are also scheduled.
