Trichy: The city witnessed yet another   against the setting up of a   outlet, at Ambedkar Nagar in Srirangam on Monday.

 The residents of Ambedkar Nagar ward number 4 had been up in arms for the past one week after Tasmac authorities entered into an agreement with an individual to set up an outlet in the area. The authorities had planned to relocate a shop from Thanjavur Road to Ambedkar Nagar. 
 
 The protest reached its peak on Monday when residents and cadres of CPI gathered in front of the proposed site and raised slogans, demanding authorities to drop the plan. 
 
 Anticipating the protest, the city police had fortified the area with barricades. The protesters confronted policemen stationed at the site and forced them to remove the barricades. They, then, sat on the ground and raised slogans against the authorities. 
 
 The protests took an ugly turn after police asked the protesters to disperse, but they stood their ground. Police vacated the protesters forcefully which led to a minor scuffle. 
 
 Srirangam taluk tahsildar intervened and tried to pacify the agitators. “As of now, there is no plan to set up the shop there. Tasmac officials will take a call on the matter,” said tahsildar Shanmuga Rajeswaran. 
 
 In the wake of the Supreme Court order, Tasmac has closed 119 out of the 204 outlets in Trichy. It had earlier reduced the number of shops by 25 in two phases in June 2016 and March 2017 as per the order of the state government.
