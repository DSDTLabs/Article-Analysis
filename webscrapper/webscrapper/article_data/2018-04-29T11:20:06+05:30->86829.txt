CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh municipal corporation ( ) has finally sent the resolution of general house to reduce the enhanced paid   and cancel the contract with the current parking contractor, to the local bodies department of the Chandigarh administration. Now, the ball is in the court of the administration to take a decision on the issue.

 The local bodies department will now look into all the aspects of the matter, specially keeping the legal angles in mind. Since the general house in its monthly meeting few days back unanimously passed a resolution to reduce the charges, commissioner referred the matter to the local bodies department to take a decision.
 
 Sources in the administration said it would be quite difficult to reduce the charges, because the general house of the MC had passed the entire memorandum of understanding (MoU) in the general house meeting last year and withdrawing the same may be difficult.
 
 “Though, it is quite difficult at this point of time, there are definitely some alternatives like redrafting the terms and conditions and negotiating with the firm. But all such things can only be discussed once going through the entire aspect of the case,” said a senior officer.
 
 Since, MC enhanced the parking charges on April 1, officers and political representatives have come against each other. Since MC’s joint municipal commissioner   issued orders to increase the charges, city mayor   asked the finance and contract committee –F&CC— to inspect the paid parking system and table report in this regard. Meanwhile, the MC officials also constituted five teams to inspect the lots. The F&CC committee headed by former city mayor   criticised the paid parking contractor in the report, saying that nothing has been done in the name of Smart paid parking and people have been financially burdened without getting any facilities there.
