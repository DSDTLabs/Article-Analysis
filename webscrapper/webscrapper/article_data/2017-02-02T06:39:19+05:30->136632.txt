PUNE:   stands to gain big time from the Union government’s decision to operate   in smaller cities in the   (PPP) mode.

 An Airports Authority of India (AAI) official told TOI the state would get priority on this front for having the maximum number of airports in the country.
 
 The total number of airports and airstrips in Maharashtra — both used and unused — is more than 25. Of them, AAI manages six — Mumbai, Aurangabad, Pune, Solapur, Gondia and Kolhapur. The Maharashtra Airport Development Company Limited (MADC) manages a total of eight airports, but none of them is fully operational at the moment.
 
 Kolhapur, Solapur, Aurangabad and Amravati come under the tier-II category of cities. Airports in these cities are likely to get wings in PPP mode.
 
 An official at the Solapur airport told TOI that until now there was no buzz of the airport going into the hands of any private party. “This airport was leased out by AAI to the Maharashtra government for 15 years. In 2009-10, some commercial flights of the Kingfisher Airlines started, but they were stopped for some reasons in 2010. The airport has a runway of 2km. At present, only a few private flights come here,” the official said.
 
 Aviation analyst Dhairyashil Vandekar said the move of the Centre would help places like Kolhapur, Solapur and Aurngabad. “There are more than 400 airports and airstrips across the country under the UDAN (Udey Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) scheme, activated and notified for operations. When it comes to the state, 29 airports and air strips have been identified for the regional air connectivity scheme. But one needs a proper infrastructure and funding. The Centre can monitor the works and operations by the private players,” Vandekar told TOI.
 
 The airports covered under UDAN include those at Kolhapur, Solapur and Gondia — operated by AAI.
 
 The AAI manages 125 airports across the country. Of them, eighteen are international and 78 are domestic. The rest are other types of airports.
