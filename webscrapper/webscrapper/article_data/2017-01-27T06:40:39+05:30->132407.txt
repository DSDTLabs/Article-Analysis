BENGALURU: A day after   termed the   and  , Uber said they are not in violation of the law. 

 "Ride-sharing products like UberPOOL are the future of urban mobility, helping decongest cities by getting more people into fewer cars and making commuting more affordable. We will continue to engage with the   on this," Uber said in an official statement.
 
 Carpooling has still not been legalized for taxi-hailing aggregators as per the Karnataka On-demand Transportation Technology Rules, 2016. They only allow companies to drive from point to point by obtaining a licence. They also mandate installation of panic buttons and electronic fare meters, and real-time monitoring of cabs. However, most cabs operating in the city are yet to fulfill the above conditions. 
 
  Uber said, "With the cost of shared rides up to 50% lesser than solo ones, the response to UberPOOL in Bengaluru has been phenomenal. Over 25% of our total trips in Bengaluru are shared. In one year, UberPOOL users in the city have saved around 93,64,772 kms, which translates into saving 4,40,623 litres of fuel and over 10,37,000 kgs of carbon emissions." 
 
  The department, however, said it will take action against the aggregators for running carpooling services without prior permission.
