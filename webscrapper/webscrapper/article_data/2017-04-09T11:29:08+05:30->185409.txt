 To begin with, the police have decided to launch an awareness campaign from Monday, which will be a “no-horn day”.
 
 The police said that after initial awareness, they will start penalising motorists caught honking unnecessarily on the city’s roads. 
 
 “Sound pollution is a menace greatly affecting every human being. Loud noise also raises the blood pressure and heart beats. The initiative is a step forward in building a city that respects people and has a patient approach to traffic problems,” city police chief   said on Saturday. 
 
 He appealed to every citizen to make Nashik city organised and peaceful. 
 
 Deputy Commissioner of Police (zone 1)   said that the no-horn day has been initiated by the police commissioner. Apart from awareness, strict action will be taken against motorists seen honking in silent zones, said Patil.
 
 There are many silent zones in the city, mainly around schools and hospitals. However, the boards announcing silent zones are brazenly ignored by motorists.
 
 A senior police official said that with the right kind of awareness and action against motorists for honking would certainly help in bringing the noise levels down. 
 
 The official said that if a motorists adopts defensive driving, he or she not only brings down the chances of accidents, but also contributes in bringing the sound pollution down. 
 
 Suresh Lokhande, a resident of the Nashik Road area, said, “Apart from people who have residences along busy roads, elderly pedestrians are the ones who suffer the most because of honking. 
 
 He said that action against such motorists on busy roads is welcome but police should also keep a watch on erring motorists in the interior parts of the city.
