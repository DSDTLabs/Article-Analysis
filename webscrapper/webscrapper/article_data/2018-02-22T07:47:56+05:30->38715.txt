CHENNAI: The police on Wednesday arrested a 45-year-old man who had groped at least 10 women in and around  . 

 S  , a resident of Nagathaman Koil Street, West Mambalam, accosted and groped women on lonely stretches at night, a police officer said. The victims included a doctor and a college student.
 
 "Jayaprakash would cover his motorcycle registration number with a sticker and wear helmet to hide his face when he approached women," the officer said. "He approached them on the pretext of looking for an address, groped them and escaped on his bike before they had the time to react." 
 
 At least five women lodged complaints with the Kotturpuram police against Jayaprakash, who runs a cargo agency in   and has two daughters.
 
 With inputs from one complainant, a special police team of   deputy commissioner from Kotturpuram nabbed Jayaprakash near Kotturpuram. They caught him in the act, as he approached a women, with his bike number plates concealed. Jayaprakash had been groping women for more than six months, the officer said.
 
 He told police he had once read a newspaper report about two mobile snatchers using helmets and hiding their bike number plates to evade arrest. "He decided to use the same modus operandi to avoid being caught," the officer said.
 
 Jayaprakash said he had confessed to his wife about what he was up to. She told him to use self control but he could not stop himself, the officer said. 
 
 He told his wife no one would discover his identity because he wore a helmet and hid his number plates. While returning from office he passed through Alandur, Guindy, Saidapet, Nandanam and Kotturpuram, where he molested women.
 
 "Many victims were reluctant to lodge a police complaint against him," said an investigating officer. He was booked for harassing women and remanded in prison.
