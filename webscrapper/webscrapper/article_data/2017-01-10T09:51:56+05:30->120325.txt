BENGALURU: Police have some   ahead in the  , with   that the entire incident was stage-managed. The police will have to close the current case and get court's permission to open a fresh case of perjury against the suspects. 

 A 23-year-old woman was allegedly molested on   on Friday morning, when she was heading to work. She later filed a complaint with KG Halli police. 
 
 The woman's brother-in-law,  , 34, was arrested on Sunday in connection with the molestation complaint. He, however, confessed to have fabricated the molestation as he thought it would taint his sister-in-law and he could marry her. The duo was allegedly in a relationship for some time.
