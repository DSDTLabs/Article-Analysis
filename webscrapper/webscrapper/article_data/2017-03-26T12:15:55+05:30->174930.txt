NAGPUR: More than 90% of the massive fire in   dumping yard has been brought under  , informed   Municipal Corporation ( ) officials on Saturday.

 Staffers of NMC’s fire and emergency services department are constantly on their toes since the last five days, trying to bring it under control. The fire, which is believed to be man-made, broke on Tuesday around 9.45am. Since then, one or two fire tenders have been deployed at the spot constantly to douse the fire. Sources said that there is a possibility that the fire might have been set off by ragpickers. “A large number of ragpickers enter the dumping site daily due to lack of security. They burn the garbage to segregate the valuable items like metal from the everyday garbage,” they added.
