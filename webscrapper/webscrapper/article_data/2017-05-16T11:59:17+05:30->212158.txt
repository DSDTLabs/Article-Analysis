CHENNAI: Making an emotional plea to ‘superstar’ Rajinikanth, the actor’s fans urged him to   and “take over the reins of   which is without a leader”. More than a thousand fans from Karur, Kanyakumari and Dindigul districts thronged the   at Kodambakkam to catch a glimpse of the star after a gap of eight years. 

 Like cadres raising slogans for their leader, Rajini fans paraded the street outside the venue which was lined with policemen. As part of his five-day interaction with fans, Rajinikanth posed for photographs with them. During Rajinikanth’s 16-minute speech, any mention of his possible entry into politics evoked thunderous applause from fans, but the fans were left guessing even at the end of the address. However, they remain optimistic.
 
 ‘Rajini’ Ramesh, 48, from the KK Nagar unit of the star’s fan association has been a fan since the release of ‘Bairavi’ in 1978. Ramesh said, “Thalaivar (leader) will stand for the people. He will enter politics in three to six months.” Asked if Rajinikanth will seek support from political parties, Ramesh said, “Superstar will arrive alone like a lion. Some parties have been seeking his support but he will stand alone and serve.”
 
 Fans pointed out that Rajinikanth could have become the chief minister in 1996 had he stood alone. A fan S Kumar said, “Instead of sitting in the CM chair, he gave it away.” When the actor advised the fans to give up drinking and smoking, many welcomed the appeal. ‘Basha’ Mani, 38, said, “I am addicted to alcohol. But I have decided to give it up after hearing what superstar said.”
