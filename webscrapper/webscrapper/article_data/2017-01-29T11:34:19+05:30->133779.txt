:PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Five Pimpri Chinchwad corporators, three from the   and two from the Nationalist  , have submitted their resignations to municipal commissioner Dinesh Waghmare, and may soon join the Bharatiya Janata Party. 

 The three Sena corporators are Seema Savale, Asha Shendge and  , while the two NCP corporators are Balasaheb Taras and Maya Barne.
 
 It may be recalled that the Shiv Sena had expelled Savale and Shendge prior to the Lok Sabha elections in 2014. 
 
 Meanwhile, the civic body has received six complaints from citizens about violation of the election code of conduct, said assistant municipal commissioner  . “The complaints were related to the flex boards in the wards,” Mane said, adding, “We are receiving complaints through the toll free number as well as to the returning officers.”
 
 Waghmare said, “There are 11 lakh voters in the city, which translates into 1,607 polling booths for the elections. Each polling booth will handle an average of 750 voters. As there are four wards in each panel, there will be at least four electronic voting machines (EVMs) and one control unit in each polling booth. We will be providing all the necessary assistance to senior citizens, the differently-abled and others to be able to vote.”
 
 Waghmare added, “We have received 10,000 EVMs from Pune and Satara districts. Each of the 11 Returning Officers will prepare a list of the number of EVMs needed for the ward panels under his jurisdiction.”
