VISAKHAPATNAM:   exponents led by B Vikram Kumar Goud carried out a   near the GVMC Gandhi statue on Wednesday against the   attempted by 7,000 students from social welfare schools on Tuesday.

 The protesters said the performance in the presence of chief minister N   was a sham display and anybody not familiar with the dance form was in danger of believing it to be real. They also pointed out that even the basics such as the attire or the movements were not paid attention to by those in-charge of the performance.
 
 The protesters further said it was unfair that tax payersâ€™ money was wasted on such an effort.
