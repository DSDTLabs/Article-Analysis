NEW DELHI: "Security forces are working on a secret weapon to disperse crowds," said attorney general   to the   today, while defending the use of 
  in the Kashmir valley.

 "Skunk water, laser dazzlers and high intensity noise devices have not been successful in dispersing protesters," Rohatgi told the apex court.
 
 He also said the Centre is exploring other options like rubber bullets, instead of pellet guns.
 
 "A rubber bullet not as lethal as pellet gun, but it'll be used only as a last resort," Rohatgi said, according to ANI.
 
 The top court was hearing a petition filed by the Jammu and   against pellet guns. Security forces used them in Kashmir during the unrest last year following the death of   terrorist  .
 
 At a hearing last month, the SC asked if other crowd-dispersal methods could be used. 
 
 "There is no question of the court saying what weapons to use but the situation has arisen and we are a welfare state after all. We are of the impression that there are other methods that can be adopted," the court had said.
 
 In response, the Centre had placed before the court an October 2016 report by the ministry of home affairs on alternatives to pellet guns but asked the court to not accept the copies on record as they may fall into undesirable hands.
  
  
 
 
 
 The court had also asked the government to state steps taken for minors who were injured due to pellet guns.
