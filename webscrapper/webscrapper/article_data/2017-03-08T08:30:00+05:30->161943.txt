NEW DELHI: The first list of children selected for   in 1,700 city schools has been released, leaving most parents hassled as their ward’s name did not figure in any of the lists.

 A parent, Munmun Vij, posted on a parents’ forum that she had applied in 55 schools for her daughter’s admission, but has been disappointed so far.
 
 “I stay in south Delhi and have applied in 55 schools for my daughter. However, till now we have not been able to secure a seat in a single school. I am simply loosing hope as to I don’t know what to do next,” she said.
 
 Another parent, Deepti Singhal, too posted, “I had applied in 44 schools and till date no seat.”
 
 Meanwhile, principals have urged parents to keep calm, since more names will figure in the coming lists. “This is just the first list. There is always a large number of people who apply at multiple schools. Once their ward gets admission in a school, other seats are left empty. These seats will figure in the following lists,” said Ashok Pandey, principal of Ahlcon International.
 
 Pandey also said that severe disparity in the number of seats and the number of applicants has given rise to the admission crisis.
 
 “These 1,700 schools are at least 5 years old. There were 1,200 schools 10 years ago. Which means the number of private schools have increased nominally, even as the population has boomed,” he said. Also, the number of seats has also decreased with the inclusion of EWS seats in the lot.
 
 Jyoti Arora, the principal of   agreed. But, according to her, parents also focus on just a few schools because of which some schools get more applications than others.
 
 “Most parents want to find seats in ‘A’ category schools. Yes, facilities make a difference, but at least the child is getting educated,” she said. However, she said not more than 25% seats will be freed up in the second list.
