 Health minister   cut the ceremonial cake to mark the function opened. Named ‘Cerebrexia, Adrenalising Youth’, the event is on the lines of AIIMS-Delhi’s ‘Pulse’ in which students of all the technical institutes participate in different activities. Eight medical colleges of the state besides NIT, IIT-Patna, NIFT, CUSB and CNLU are taking part in the competition. “IGIMS is the first institute of the state to host such a function,” organizing secretary Dr Manish Mandal said.
 
 Students and faculty members of IGIMS took part in a medical parliament and debated the topic of ‘Replacing Medical Council of India (MCI) with   (NMC)’. Though most of the medical bodies, including state and national IMA, are against the Centre’s idea, IGIMS medical superintendent Dr P K Sinha said the MCI must be replaced with NMC because MCI is a British idea and it’s time is over. In fact, the motion for NMC got 15 votes against 5 for MCI.
 
 A seminar on human rights of patients, their attendants and doctors was also organized on Friday. Justice (retd) Rajendra Prasad, advocate Anurag Kumar, DIG (central range) Shalin also participated in the seminar.
