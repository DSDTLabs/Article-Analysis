Tirupur: A 27-year-old labourer was arrested for marrying a 14-year-old girl in Tirupur district on Saturday after the victim’s friends contacted Chidline. The girl informed the district Childline officials that her parents forcefully married her off.  Raghu (name changed) 27, of Mudhalipalayam is working as a tailor in a private knitwear manufacturing company. He wished to marry 14-year-old Kanchana (name changed), his niece. The girl’s parents agreed for the marriage, said Childline sources. Kanchana, the only daughter to her parents, was studying Class IX in a government school near Old bus stand. A few days back, the girl’s parents took her to Raghu’s house. She was then forcefully married to Raghu in a temple, said the sources. On Saturday, a few of her schoolmates contacted Childline and informed about the child marriage. With the help of police, the district social welfare department authorities and Childline officials reached Raghu’s house. “When we enquired, Raghu and others admitted that the marriage was conducted without the consent of Kanchana. Though Kanchana’s parents, both were labourers, knew that it was wrong to conduct the child marriage, they were not aware about the consequences,” said a Childline officer. “We will send her to a government-recognised home if her parents plan to send Kanchana back with Raghu. We will ensure that she continues her education,” he added. Kangeyam All Women Police registered a case under The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006and arrested Raghu.
