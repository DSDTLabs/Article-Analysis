LUCKNOW: Dropsy, a disease caused by consumption of adulterated mustard oil, seems to have resurfaced in   after 13 years, killing four of a family from   while two other members are currently hospitalized. 

 
 Dr Himanshu of King George's Medical University, who is attending to the patients - Swati (4) and Ashok Kumar (65) - told TOI, "They are in a state of shock due to four deaths in the family, but are stable."
 
  
  
 The diagnosis was made by doctors at the Institute of Medical Sciences Banaras Hindu University (BHU). "Dropsy was diagnosed symptomatically after patients showed clear symptoms of the disease. The diagnosis was supported by the pattern of deaths in the family," Dr Himanshu added.
 
 Ashok's eldest son   told TOI that the family was living in Maharashtra's Palghar till December 2017, but shifted to their native village in Jaunpur after Ashok's health deteriorated. "While my father's treatment was underway, my mother complained of diarrhoea and swelling in the legs. She died on April 26 during treatment," he said. "Later, my sister-in-law Kavita showed similar symptoms and died on May 3. Soon after, my brothers Dheeraj and Neeraj developed the same disease and died on May 14 and 24, respectively," Pankaj added.
 
 Epidemic dropsy was reported in Lucknow in February 2005 when several died and over 75 had taken ill due to consumption of adulterated mustard oil.
