Erode: A three-month-old female elephant calf was found dead in Thanakkumaduvu area in Andhiyur forest in Erode district on Thursday. Forest department officials and veterinary doctors confirmed that the calf died due to parasitic infection.

 Andhiyur forest officials had spotted the carcass during a routine patrol. A team of veterinarians also arrived at the place after the officials informed them. However, they could not approach it as the mother elephant was guarding the carcass. They beat drums and blasted crackers to chase the mother away into the deep forest.
 
 The veterinarians performed an autopsy on the spot and buried the carcass in the forest itself. “We suspect the calf was suffering from intestinal worms and thus stopped eating,” said a forest official. tnn
