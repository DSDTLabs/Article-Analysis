MUMBAI: A senior citizen was injured when a   of the   station   crashed on him on Tuesday evening. A TOI Citizen Reporter had reported how earlier too a portion of the same skywalk had crashed, and it was covered up with concrete manhole covers. The skywalk, built by Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), was opened in 2011.

 Sunil Kulkarni (65) and his sister were returning home in Charni Road when the portion fell directly on him at 7.40pm. He was rushed in an autorickshaw to a local hospital, where he was given eight stitches on his head. Kulkarni had visited his brother in Dahisar.
 
 Recounting the chaos, a local shopkeeper said, “One minute everything was normal, we were attending to customers, and the next moment, I heard a loud crash, immediately followed by a lot of dust and commotion. Two other pedestrians reportedly escaped with minor injuries. The area was quarantined by police immediately after that.”
 
 A local vendor said he heard the sound of glass bottles crashing, which locals confirmed, claiming that the skywalk has become a hideout for illicit activities and is sparingly used by pedestrians. On October 1, 2016, a metal panel of the Bandra (W) skywalk had   onto Dr Ravindra Diddee’s SUV. He had said that liquor bottles too had fallen on his SUV.
 
 Dr Shreya Mehta, who is treating Kulkarni, said, “He is doing well, he’s moving. Since it fell from a height, we suspected it to be bad, so a CT scan and other tests were conducted, and he was cleared. He will most probably be discharged by Thursday,” she said.
 
 Dahisar police visited Kulkarni at the hospital on Wednesday, but no FIR has been registered yet.
 
 Assistant municipal commissioner (R North ward) Vijay Kamble said the executive engineer had visited the site and they were in talks with consultants. “The matter is under investigation,” Kamble added.
