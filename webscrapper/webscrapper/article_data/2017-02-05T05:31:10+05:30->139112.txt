NEW DELHI: Keeping in mind the brilliance in studies of a young boy with limited means, the   has awarded a compensation of over Rs 1 crore holding the   government vicariously liable for amputation of the boy's arms due to electrocution in an agricultural field.

 On March 18, 2012, the eight year-old had accompanied his mother to collect 'saag' (spinach) from the field. He was electrocuted by a high-tension live wire and fell unconscious.He had severe burn injuries. A week later, doctors at   Medical Hospital at Tanda in   district amputated both his arms. The boy suffered 100% disability and his poor parents incurred an expense of Rs 2 lakh.
 
 The boy , through his mother, moved the   high court seeking a compensation of Rs 50 lakh saying he has become totally dependent on family members for his day-to-day activities for his entire life. The boy had to discontinue schooling after the unfortunate incident.
 
 The HC on January 9 allowed the mother's petition and awarded a compensation of Rs 1.25 crore. The state government appealed against the judgement in the SC complaining that the compensation amount was on the steeper side.
 
 An SC bench of Justices J Chelameswar and A M Sapre, while holding the state responsible, said, “Having regard to the family background of the boy and his excellent performance as a brilliant student, he would have easily earned Rs 30,000 per month in his life.“ It took this as a criteria to calculate the compensation to be awarded to the boy.
 
 Finally , the court awarded a simple interest of 6% on Rs 90 lakh from 2013, the year when the boyhad filed the writ petition in the HC. Thus, the total compensation to be paid by the state government would be Rs 1.16 crore.
