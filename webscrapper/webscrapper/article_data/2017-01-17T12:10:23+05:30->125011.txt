 "I am being projected as a role model for Kashmiri Youth. I want to make it very clear that I do not want anyone to follow in my footsteps or even consider me as a role model. I'm not proud of what I'm doing and I want everyone, especially the Youth, to know that there are real role models out there whether they be in this time or history. To even consider me as a role model would be disgracing them and their disgrace would be our disgrace," she wrote. 
 
 Seeking forgiveness, Zaira wote, " 
  who I've unintentionally hurt... especially considering that what had happened over the past six months."

We have made the nation proud by winning medals. It is a proud moment for the citizens of the country. Zaira has worked hard to play my role."
 
 National Conference chief   supported her while taking a dig at Mehbooba. He tweeted: "A 16-year-old shouldn't be forced to apologise & that too allegedly for meeting @MehboobaMufti. What are we coming to!!!!!"
