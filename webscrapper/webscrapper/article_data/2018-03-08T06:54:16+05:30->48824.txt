LUCKNOW : Files of around 200 properties given out on rent by   have been reported missing, said its rent department.

 LDA owns 1,924 properties, both residential and commercial, that were rented out to people during the 1960s.
 
 Meanwhile, LDA officials realised that over the past few years, many tenants had failed to deposit rent while a few had even secretly sold properties to others.
 
 An officer on special duty ( ) found that files of around 200 properties were missing from the LDA office. According to LDA’s assessment, there are around 551 rented properties for which rent has not been deposited for about five years. Officials have sent notices to these tenants to appear before LDA and deposit rent or their lease will be cancelled.
 
 Under a government order, LDA allows the tenant to sell the rented property on the condition that the third party is ready to pay a fee. This is 50% of the property’s total cost based on DM circle rate. The buyer has to submit a mutation form to change the owner’s name in LDA records. After this, he gets free-hold right over the property and can even re-build the structure. The order came after several people reported that these rented buildings are in a dilapidated condition.
 
 LDA is organising a registry camp for rented properties from March 10-25 to enable all those who have either sold property or intend to do so to pay a mutation fee. Those who have not paid rent for years can also deposit it. If the property has been passed on to an heir, he needs to submit a succession certificate and the publication amount.
 
 LDA’s OSD   said, “We have issued a letter to the company keeping records of LDA files in   to retrieve copies of the missing files. We hope to get them before the camp.”
