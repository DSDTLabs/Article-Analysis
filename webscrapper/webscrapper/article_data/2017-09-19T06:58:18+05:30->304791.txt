KOLKATA: Mayor   on Monday instructed civic officials to crack down on   lot attendants to single out the errant ones who are reportedly fleecing carowners ahead of the festive season. The move came after the mayor received a series of complaints of car attendants taking advantage of the Puja rush and indulging in high-handedness.

 Chatterjee has also taken up the matter with additional police commissioner (traffic) Vineet Goyal and deputy commissioner (traffic) V Solomon Nesakumar and urged them to run a parallel inquiry into the charges made against car-parking agencies. 
 
 “I am upset with some agencies. I have asked Kolkata Police brass to probe into the matter. We will conduct an inquiry simultaneously. We will get tough with the agencies if found guilty. The minimum punishment will be cancellation of licences to run parking lots,” Chatterjee told reporters on Monday. 
 
 Debasish Kumar, mayor-in-council member overseeing the KMC car parking department, agreed with the mayor. “We need to get tough with a section of parking agencies who have been flouting rules at will,” Kumar said.
 
 According to a KMC car parking department official, most of the complaints were being reported from the shopping hotspots. “Complaints are pouring in from car owners who were harassed and made to pay extra in areas like New Market, Gariahat, Bidhan Sarani (Hatibagan), to name a few,” said the official. 
 
 Some car owners, said a KMC source, were even forced to pay Rs 40 per hour ahead of the Puja. The normal rate is Rs 10 per hour. Some agencies were so desperate that they did not bother to harass even a Trinamool Congress councillor, a civic official said. 
 
 “We have received a complaint from Ellora Saha, a ruling party councillor from Pathuriaghata Street. Saha was threatened by the owner of a car parking agency recently near Burrabazar,” he said.
