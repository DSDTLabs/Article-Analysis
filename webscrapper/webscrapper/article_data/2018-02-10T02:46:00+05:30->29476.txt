Kuchipudi: Three years ago, Cherukuri Venkata Lakshmaiah (50) and his wife Padmavathi (40) were the last family making Kuchipudi sarees in the village for generations. Around seven months ago, they stopped making it due to poverty and lack of manpower to weave sarees. 

 While the state government is keen on protecting the Kuchipudi dance, the economy in birthplace of the art form is leaning forward to collapse with the passage of every year. “It is sad to see that the village is being put on a ventilator by the government to ensure that its indigenous origins remain protected. I wanted to purchase that saree but to know that it no longer exists is heartbreaking for a dancer to hear,” Krishnaveni, an alumni of Siddhendra Yogi Kuchipudi Kalapeetham said. 
 
 “We need at least three people to weave these sarees and supply them to shops across the Movva mandal. Recently, my father-in-law became paralysed and now it is a herculean task to make the sarees with only two persons,” Padmavathi said. 
 
 Selling the saree for Rs 200, Lakshmaiah did not make much profit and the business did not go down well with less awareness among people about the product. 
 
 However, Vedantam Ramalinga Sastry, principal of Kuchipudi School said that their sarees would be sold as hot cakes in shops especially after tourists discovered its significance.
 
 “For generations our family members have been making these sarees for performers and we were not ambitious about our business. I remember that I had learnt it during my childhood,” Padmavathi remembered.
 
 Now, the only nearby place where performers from the village can get the sarees is Ghantasala village. 
 
 And Padmavathi innocently points with a heavy heart to other shops to her customers who are not aware of the significance of their business.
