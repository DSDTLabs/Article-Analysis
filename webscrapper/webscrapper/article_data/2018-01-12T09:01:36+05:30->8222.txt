NEW DELHI: As the Centre and Jammu and Kashmir step up efforts to wean away Kashmiri youths who have recently joined militancy or may be mulling that option, the state government has decided to allow full amnesty to local militants who have not taken part in any terror act yet and are willing to come back to their families.

 Also, the government is working on measures to gainfully engage the   in ‘positive’ activities like sports and tourism-related jobs so as to remove the feeling of ‘alienation’ they may have grown up with amid the vicious circle of violence in the Valley.
 
 “The idea behind allowing local militants to rejoin their families without any fear of being arrested and charged, especially since they have not participated in any action, is to deter them from indulging in violence before it is too late. The J&K government adopted this ‘soft’ approach in the case of four local boys from south Kashmir who responded to their families’ appeals and shunned militancy. The effort is to continue this approach and encourage local boys, including AMU scholar   who is said to have joined Hizbul Mujhaideen, to quietly return to their families rather than risk being killed in action,” said a senior officer.
 
 The officer clarified that the amnesty will not apply to terrorists who have been involved in attacks. “The hardcore local militants will continue to be engaged and challenged,” he stated. 
 
 As for the ‘alienated’ local youth prone to joining militancy, the government intends to engage them in positive/recreational activities like sports while also giving a boost to tourism so as to generate jobs.
 
 The ‘soft’ approach towards local Kashmiris aged between 15 and 25 years, who have joined   or Lashkare-Taiba and may be training in forested areas of the state, comes at the end of “bad” year that saw nearly 117 locals joining militancy. This is the highest in past few years. In fact, unofficial estimates put the figure even higher at around 150.
