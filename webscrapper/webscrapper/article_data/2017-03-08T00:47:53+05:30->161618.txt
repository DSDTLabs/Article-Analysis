Pune:   Lt Gen Sarath Chand said on Monday that   among the Indian Armed Forces is must in the view of the futuristic warfare.

 Speaking to TOI on the sideline of decommissioning ceremony of   on Monday at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai, Chand said, “The synergy between the forces is paramount as the futuristic wars will be fought in jointmanship (joint warfare by Army, Navy and Air Force).”
 
 Chand is also the Colonel of the Regiment of 7 Garhwal Rifles of the Indian Army, which has had a long association with the INS Viraat since 1989 when the ship participated in its first major operation called ‘Operation Jupiter’. 
 
 Talking about his association with the ship, Chand said, “INS Viraat’s first major operation was ‘Operation Jupiter’ that was held in July 1989 as a part of the Indian Peace Keeping Operations in Sri Lanka in the wake of the breakdown of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord of 1986. On July 27, 1989, the ship mounted 76 helo sorties off Kochi to embark over 350 Army personnel and over 35 tons of stores of the 7 Garhwal Rifles. Because of this contribution, the ship had become a integral part of the regiment till 2017.” 
 
 The Vice Chief said the ship will always remain special for the regiment. “As the Indian Army’s troops are mainly deployed in northern and eastern regions, they do not have direct involvement with the Navy. However, having association with various ships will certainly help to develop a decent understanding between the two forces that is crucial in the present scenario and in the future,” he said. 
 
 Former Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash said over the phone, “The Indian Army’s association with various ships should not remain ceremonial. The government should take concrete steps to bring synergy among the forces by raising combined defence headquarters, which will pave the way for jointmanship in the future.”
