PANAJI: Days after the   (GSPCB) revoked South West Port Limited’s (SWPL) consent to operate   handling at Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) for excess handling of coal, the SWPL has approached the board for fresh consent. 

 “We would like to bring to your notice that the environmental clearance for the SWP facility at berth 5A and 6A of MPT was obtained in January 24, 2001,” SWPL stated in its application. “The said EC does not specify any cargo limits for the terminal. However, in the application made for EC to the ministry of shipping, the feasibility report, terrestrial environmental impact assessment report, and marine EIA report give the likely traffic projections separately.”
 
 SWPL said that in the feasibility report, it was clearly mentioned that in 2011-12, out cargo projections at berth 5A and 6A would be 13.88 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA), increasing gradually from 2.5 MMTPA at the start of project in 2004.
 
 The SWPL said that they initially obtained from GSPCB consent to establish and consent to operate at 3 MMTPA coal handling in 2004, which was increased to 5 in 2005 after total mechanization by amendment. In 2006, it said the renewal of consent allowed for 5.5 MMTPA coal/coke, 1 MMTPA limestone, and 1 MMPTA steel. The SWPL also said that environmental considerations have inspired it to carry out modifications in processes.
