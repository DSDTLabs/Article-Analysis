HYDERABAD: Mincing no words, Chief Minister   on Sunday told   farmers that monkeys are not at fault but human beings are to blame for monkey menace. People have chopped off the wild fruit bearing trees in forest areas and on the outskirts of villages, forcing monkeys to infiltrate habitations and agricultural fields in search of food. 

 Responding to queries, on monkey menace in villages, at the   awareness meeting at Agriculture University on Sunday,   said the solution to prevent monkey menace is to plant fruit bearing trees on village outskirts and forest areas.
 
 The chief minister directed officials of the forest, agriculture and horticulture departments to hold a meeting and come out with solutions to prevent monkey menace as well as stopping wild boars from damaging the crops.
 
 At the meeting, KCR assured the farmers that the state government will soon come out with a scheme to extend subsidy for setting up solar fencing around agricultural and horticulture fields to protect crops from wild boars, monkeys and other animals.
 
 The chief minister felicitated farmers and Rythu Samanvaya Samithi president and members who donated land for setting up Rythu Vedikas (farmers meeting place). "These Rythu vedikas would be set up for every 5,000 acres of agricultural land and the state government will sanction 12 lakh for each vedika," the chief minister added.
