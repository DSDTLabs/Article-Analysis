RAMANATHAPURAM:   apprehended 10 Indian fishermen and their fishing craft on charges of poaching in their territorial waters on Monday night. Around 600 fishing trawlers sailed from   fishing jetty on Monday and returned after fishing on Tuesday morning. Among the trawlers, one belonging to R Kans from Thangachimadam was apprehended by the Sri Lankan navy. 

 Sri Lankan navy website mentioned that a fast attack craft attached to the Northern Naval Command arrested 10 Indian fishermen with their fishing trawler poaching in the sea area two nautical miles South off Delft Island on Monday. The arrested fishermen and their craft was taken to naval base Elara and were handed over to assistant director of fisheries in Jaffna for further action.
 
 U Arulanandam of Alliance for Release of Innocent Fishermen at Pamban said the arrested fishermen were produced before Kytes court in Sri Lanka and were remanded in judicial custody till February 21. The fishermen were lodged in Jaffna prison. Altogether, 35 fishermen have been detained by Sri Lanka since January 2017. The number of boats in Sri Lankan custody has touched 130, including 10 from Karaikal. 
 
 However, fishermen sources says it is intriguing that 10 fishermen have been apprehended in a fishing trawler since the usual crew of each trawler is usually four to six people. The sources also claimed that the trawler developed a technical snag mid-sea and crew members from another trawler boarded the vessel to repair it but were rounded up by Sri Lankan navy.
