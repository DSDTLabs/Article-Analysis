ITANAGAR:   has drawn flak from the   (ACS) for making an appeal to the   to move cow   away from the  . 

 "The recent appeal made to the capital administration is just a stunt to appease the BJP government at the Centre. The party workers, who themselves are tribals from the state, need to know that majority of the tribes in the state and the northeast depend on beef. Till now, we really can't see any visible cow slaughter house except a few beef shops in daily markets," ACS chairman Patey Tayum said on Saturday.
 
 "It seems BJP and its workers are more interested in propagating Hindutva than development," he added.
