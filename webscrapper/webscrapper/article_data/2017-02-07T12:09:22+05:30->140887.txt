Veteran filmmaker   recently said in an interview that he was pulled out from mental trauma by none other than his close friend, actor  .

 The ugly divorce of the director with actress   had left him shattered and kept him away from films. He gives the credit to Mohanlal to help him out of depression and to make a comeback with a bang through ‘Oppam’, which turned out to be super hit in the box office.
 
 Breathing a sigh of relief Priyadarshan added that it was a traumatic time for him and felt he lost the ability to make films. “He (Mohanlal) told me I had to get back to work, and not with another comedy. Mohanlal and I have done nearly 40 films together, many of them comedies. I could've easily done another comedy with him. But he insisted we do something we haven't done before (sic)”. He adds, "My big moment of vindication was when   called me and said he couldn't believe I had made this film after what I had gone through in my personal life. (sic)".
