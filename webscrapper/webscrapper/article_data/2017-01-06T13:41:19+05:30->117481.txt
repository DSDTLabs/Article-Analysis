 Commissioner Shukla touched upon one case from last year wherein, acting on a tip-off, the police had raided 10 call centres suspected to be operating illegally.
 
 “We came upon irregularities and sent reports to the government offices which issue licenses to call centres. Now, they will initiate action. In the meantime, we registered two offences as per the Telegraph Act,” Sakore said.
 
 According to Sakore, police had unearthed gangs based in Delhi, Noida and Chhattisgarh involved in   frauds.
