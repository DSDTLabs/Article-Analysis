NEW DELHI: The Centre has decided to take ideas from several experts and expert organisations to achieve   sustainable goals. It has roped in   Research institute to get inputs on how to go about the programme.
 
  In a two-day seminar held during the weekend, experts from the institute have urged the government to focus on Sangh ideologue Deendayal Upadhyay's philosophy of integral humanism , shifting to Indian way of living and dependence of family to promote well-being.
  
  The seminar also saw the participation of finance minister   and MP Vinay Sahasrabudhhe. Former MP and chairman of Research and Development Foundation for Integral Humanism Mahesh Chandra Sharma said the need of the hour was to look at imbibing Upadhyay's theory of integral humanism. "To achieve sustainable goals, we need to focus on lifestyle that is sustainable and   that will determine the way our resources get empowered. The West propounds a theory that makes material conquests the focus on human life. But in Indian traditions, spirituality and family matter, these factors also contribute majorly to the wellbeing of Indians. The focus should be on empowering Indians, increasing their esteem by giving them a life of dignity." Agreed by world leaders in 2015, the sustainable development goals also known as the Global Goals, are a universal call to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
  
  On Saturday, Minister for External Affairs Sushma Swarajtold the   General Assembly that the complete eradication of poverty is the most important priority for the Government of India, as she outlined some of the measures taken to advance this goal.
