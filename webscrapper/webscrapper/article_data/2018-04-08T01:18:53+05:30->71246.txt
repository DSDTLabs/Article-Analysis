NEW DELHI: Solving a case, or being a part of a crucial investigation, will not only earn cops brownie points but also provide pointers to others.   is setting up an   that will enable its personnel to share know-how about crucial cases with their colleagues. 

 Refresher courses for trainee cops will be imparted through an online interface. An e-learning   will evaluate the aptitude and performance of an officer, which will help the brass decide on postings based on skills.
 
 DCP (training)   said the software was being designed to make evaluation processes more interactive. The software will create a portal wherein   can log on and answer multiple-choice questions about their skills and knowledge of policing.
 
 Nalwa said the earlier process of personnel having to fill up an evaluation form resulted in inaccurate assessment as it created the pressure of a test environment. “The idea behind having a software is to make the process more transparent and simple,” Nalwa said.

It will have a section updating the personnel on new laws and amendments. Court orders and directives from the police commissioner, too, will be uploaded on the portal.
 
 Each policeman will have an unique login ID to access the portal. They will have the option to place queries on sections of penal codes or seek guidance on handling specific situations. For the time-being, the portal can be accessed through search engines, but eventually the department intends to develop a mobile phone app.
 
 Sub-inspectors and inspectors taking the refresher course will have to visit the e-academy at   to take the evaluation test. Meanwhile, the Delhi Police training unit is also conducting soft skill programme for SHOs and inspectors.
