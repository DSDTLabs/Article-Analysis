MARGAO: All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and in-charge of the Goa desk,  , on Wednesday criticized chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar for taking instructions from defence minister Manohar Parrikar over running the state’s administration.

 “The Goa government functions under the instructions of the defence minister. Parsekar, in fact, is finding it tough to win from his constituency this time,” Singh said after releasing the manifesto of incumbent Margao MLA,  .
 
 Taking a dig at the   government for its various “false assurances”, Singh said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi and defence minister Manohar Parrikar belong to the group of BJP leaders who have mastered the art of lying to the people.” 
 
 Kamat, in his address, exuded confidence of winning the Margao assembly seat by a comfortable margin. 
 
 “Parrikar recently spoke about making Margao Digambar-less. Let me tell him, no (earthly) power can dislodge me from Margao. Madganvkars want only Digambar Kamat,” Kamat, who is contesting from Margao for the seventh consecutive election, said. 
 
 He further accused the BJP government of shelving the projects he had initiated during his term as chief minister, and named the proposed ultra-modern bus stand and non-conventional energy park to drive home his point.
