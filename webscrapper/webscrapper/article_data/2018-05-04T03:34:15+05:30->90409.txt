NEW DELHI: Organisers of international conferences and seminars in India can now apply online for event clearance by the home ministry, which incidentally shall only be required where the delegates are nationals of either Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sudan or   and/or intend to visit ‘restricted’ or ‘protected’ areas such as   & Kashmir and north-east, etc. 

 
 An online system for processing security clearances to international conferences, seminars and workshops organised in India was launched by Union home secretary Rajiv Gauba on Wednesday. This, the   said, would “enable Indian missions abroad to issue conference visas to foreign nationals or delegates intending to attend such events organised by a ministry or department of the government of India, state governments or UT administrations, public sector undertakings, central educational institutions, public funded universities or private institutions or NGOs”. 
 
 
 The MHA is already following an online system for granting conference visas. With introduction of the online module, Gauba said the process has become paperless and standardised resulting in effective monitoring and timely disposal. Officials involved can access the online application and documents and take a proper decision to facilitate the organisers and participants of such conferences, he said. 
 
 Prior reference is required to be made to the MHA before granting conference visas to foreigners. Prior reference is also required if the participants of conferences must visit ‘restricted’ or ‘protected’ areas in India, or areas affected by terrorism, militancy and extremism like Jammu & Kashmir and the north- eastern states, other than Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland.
