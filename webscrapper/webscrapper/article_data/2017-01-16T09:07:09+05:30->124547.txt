Actress   is set to star in TruTV scripted comedy series.

  Every episode of the series will revolve around a traditional theme, such as fish, wood or grieving and will combine Sedaris' humor and talents as a crafter, chef, baker and hostess.
  
  "I've been doing this show in my head for years. It will be terrific to get it on TV so I can free up some wiggle room up in my skull," Sedaris said.
  
  The show joins a lineup that also includes "Impractical Jokers," "Adam Ruins Everything," "Fameless" and scripted comedy "Those Who Can't".
