MUMBAI: The economic offences wing of the city police last week arrested  , director of  , for allegedly duping another developer of Rs 101 crore. 

 The fresh case is an offshoot of the 2007 case against Sawla where he sold 133 tenements developed as part of a slum redevelopment project to people who were not eligible, including Bollywood celebrities and retired army officers. Sawla allegedly connived with the authorities such as the Slum Redevelopment Authority, the BMC and the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority, police said.
 
 Sawla has been booked for cheating, forgery, breach of trust, criminal intimidation and has been remanded to police custody.
 
 The fresh complaint was filed by Nitin Vora, a partner in Chintan Lifestyle, who alleged Sawla, on the pretext of selling two other towers in the same premises as that of Juhu Taj Society, collected Rs 101crore by submitting bogus documents and duped him, said deputy commissioner of police ( ) Parag Manere.
 
 Police said in 2013 Sawla told Vora he was developing two towers of 13 storeys each on 10th road at Juhu-Vile Parle. Sawla also showed him permissions obtained from BMC, Mhada and SRA. Sawla informed that out of 54 flats, he had already sold 30 flats in Akshar Residency, but offered to repay the buyers and hand over the project to Vora.
 
 Vora and Sawla entered into an agreement and Vora paid him Rs 101 crore in instalments. In 2016, Vora learnt the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission has passed strictures and orders against Kunal Builders. Five persons had filed a complaint against Sawla for not allotting them their flats in Akshar Residency. They were not among the 30 buyers.
 
 Vora further learnt about the 2007 case involving Sawla. The case is pending in court. Early this year, Sawla had filed a writ petition before the Bombay high court seeking quashing of the FIR against him, but the court dismissed it.
