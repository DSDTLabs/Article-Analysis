TIRUPUR: Nine people including crew members of a Tamil satellite television channel were booked for allegedly harassing a woman, who owns a power loom unit near Avinashi in Tirupur district, on Thursday.

 An FIR was filed after members of a power loom job workers association protested condemning the crew’s behaviour.
 
 According to police, K Senthil alias Selvakumar, a farmer from Sengalipalayam was running a power loom unit. His wife S Poonkodi, 34 was also looking after it. They gave accommodation to six labourers, who were all natives of other districts. 
 
 Two such labourers were Arunachalam and his wife, who worked in the unit for many months. It is said that they had received Rs.50, 000 as advance from Senthil. Earlier, Arunachalam complained that Senthil treated him and his wife as bonded labourers. However, no case was registered as both the sides were ready to settle the issue amicably, the police sources said.
 
 Meanwhile, on March 27, Arunachalam brought a crew from a Mumbai-based Tamil satellite television channel to the power loom. When the crew tried to videograph the unit, Poonkodi warned them not to come inside the unit as only she and her mother-in-law were present. 
 
 Nevertheless, the crew which was accompanied by a few lawyers barged into the unit. In between all the chaos, it is alleged that they physically harassed Poonkodi. 
 
 Irked over the incident, many villagers along with the members of a power loom job workers association demanded an apology letter for the crew’s behaviour, the police said.
 
 Later, Avinashi police booked nine persons including Saravanan, Deepan, Madhavan, Stephen, Sudhakar, Sundaramurthy, Senthil, Naveen, and Surendar under various sections including Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Women Harassment Act.
