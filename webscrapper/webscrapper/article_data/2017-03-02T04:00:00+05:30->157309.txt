Vadodara: The National Students Union of India (NSUI) rebels burnt effigies of their rival group Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and university’s security and vigilance officer P P Kanani at the main building of Faculty of Commerce on Wednesday.

 Hitesh Batra, general secretary, MSU Students Union (MSUSU), said the vigilance staff had stopped them from making representations on Tuesday and instead, they and ABVP workers harassed female students from our group. 
 
 “Kanani did not allow us to make any peaceful representation and attacked our group. So we had decided to protest against him by burning his effigy,” said Batra. He added that the vigilance staff called in police even though the representations were peaceful. “The police’s role was also suspicious. Though they arrested equal number of students from both the groups, their behaviour with students of our group was improper,” he said.
 
 “Cops pulled and dragged us and forcefully made us sit in the vans while on the other hand ABVP workers were taken to the vans in a very decent manner,” Batra added. MSUSU vice-president Priyanka Patel also lodged a complaint against Kanani with National Commission for Women on Wednesday. She has alleged that on Tuesday, Kanani misbehaved with her and used abusive language.
 
 It was on Monday that the two student groups had clashed at the main building of Faculty of Commerce when ABVP had reached the faculty to protest against “anti-national” activities at Delhi University. Both the groups had submitted applications at Sayajigunj police station.
