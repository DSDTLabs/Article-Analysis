AHMEDABAD: The two brothers accused of planning ISIS-inspired lone-wolf attack in  , Naeem and Wasim   have requested the special   (NIA) court to shift them from Rajkot’s prison to Sabarmati central jail in Ahmedabad.

 Ramodias’ advocate M M Sheikh said that the prisoners have sought jail transfer because they are produced before the court in Ahmedabad through video-conferencing from Rajkot jail and this poses a problem for them in instructing and consulting lawyers.
 
 The accused have also cited the hostility shown to them by the advocates of   and Rajkot bar associations as advocates refused to represent them after their arrest last year. The Ramodias also expressed grievance with regard to their treatment in Rajkot jail.
 
 Special NIA judge M K Dave sought a report from Rajkot jail and has posted hearing on this matter on May 8.
 
 Naeem and his elder brother Wasim were arrested by Gujarat ATS in February last year on charges of planning attacks on Chotila temple, Ahmedabad’s synagogue and at other places in the state against the ‘Kafirs’. The probe was handed over to the NIA, which filed a chargesheet stating that their handler in   was one Mufti Abdus Sami Qasmi alias Samiullah.
