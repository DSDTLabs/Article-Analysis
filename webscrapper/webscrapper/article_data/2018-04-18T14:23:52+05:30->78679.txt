PANAJI: The Goa police’s traffic cell has asked the   to suspend over 6,000 licences for overspeeding, drunken driving, jumping of red light, etc, over the past three-and-a-half months. 

 Superintendent of police (SP) Dinraj Govekar told TOI that 1,500 cases of drunken driving, and a majority of other offences have been booked around Margao,  , and the coastal belt of   and Candolim. 
 
 While the police conduct drives to combat drunken driving in the morning and evening, Govekar said that most violators are booked in the evenings. 
 
 The SP also said that the police have booked 3,764 violators for overspeeding, and that their licences have been recommended for suspension. The traffic cell has also booked 637 violators for using their cellphone while driving or riding. 
 
 This is in addition to the 493 case the police have booked for jumping the red light. “In these cases, we immediately recommend the suspension of licences,” Govekar said. 
 
 In Goa, a person is killed in a road accident every 30 hours. As the number of accidents have increased, Goa police conducted a detailed study which revealed that overspeeding and drunken driving were the main causes of accidents and fatalities on Goan roads. 
 
 To remedy this problem, the department procured and deployed 100 alcometers. In 2017, over a thousand drunken driving cases were booked by the department.
 
 Police also said that four laser speed radar guns (LSRGs) have been deployed across the state, especially at accident-prone zones. LSRGs are capable of catching speeding vehicles 300m before they reach the equipment, by which time photo and video evidence would already be collected.
