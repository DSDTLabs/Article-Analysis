PATNA: People in north and east Bihar districts can expect showers for a couple of days from Monday owing to a trough line in the foothill of Himalayas on Nepal-Bihar border. 

 Residents in the state capital can also heave a sigh of relief as weathermen claimed in case of no rain, at least the temperature would come down for a few days from Sunday owing to change in the wind direction from dry and hot westerly to moist and comparatively cooler easterly. 
 
 Weather scientist Anand Shankar of Patna meteorological centre attributed the change in wind direction to another trough line between east Bihar and Chhattisgarh. “As predicted earlier, the wind direction has changed from westerly to easterly from Friday midnight. Accordingly, moisture incursion is taking place primarily in eastern and northern parts of the state. Accordingly, we expect showers in the northern and eastern parts of the state for a couple of days from Monday onwards,” said Shankar, adding that the upcoming rainfall would fall in the category of Nor’wester. 
 
 As per meteorology, excess heating of the land during summer season results in convective currents that, in turn, help in formation of low cumulonimbus clouds, bringing rain accompanied by gusty winds and brewing a typical Nor’wester.
 
 Private weather agency Skymet has also forecast rain in Patna and Gaya for three days starting Saturday, attributing it to a western disturbance positioned over Jammu and Kashmir. 
 
 Shankar claimed the discomfort index in Patna due to searing heat is hovering around 30 at present, which falls in the category of physical and mental stress.
 
 Discomfort index indicates the combined effect of maximum temperature and the day’s relative humidity on the human body. Maximum temperature in Patna on Saturday was 41.6 degrees C, whereas the relative humidity was 34% in the morning and 42% in the evening.
