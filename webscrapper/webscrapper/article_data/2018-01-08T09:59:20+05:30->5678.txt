PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic body will need additional sanitary workers apart from its 2,000 workers and 1,500 more employed on contract. 

 The sanitary workers clean roads and gutters. In Nagpur, there are at least 8,500 workers who clean the roads. In Ahmedabad, workers clean roads on kilometre basis.
 
 The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) had contracted 68 organizations. But these organizations did not provide provident fund and were paying less salaries. After the workers’ federation approached the Bombay high court, the PCMC was instructed to ensure biometric attendance for 1,500 workers.
 
  
  
 
 When the petition of the workers’ federation was rejected by the high court, the body approached the   and filed a special leave petition. The   was rejected by the top court, municipal commissioner   said.
 
 “Labour laws are standardized. The workers’ rights are protected and they will be deployed under a new payroll. Even if an agency opts out, other agencies will work for the municipal corporation,”   said.
 
 Additional workers would be deployed because of urbanization and the inclusion of the fringe areas, Hardikar said. But the municipal chief did not disclose how many more workers will be required.
 
 Big housing societies have to collect wet waste and dispose it of as vermicompost in gardens. Dry waste is recyclable and ragpickers can collect it. “PCMC is implementing the ideal housing society scheme where environment-friendly measures are being adopted. We are giving incentives in this regard,” Hardikar said.
