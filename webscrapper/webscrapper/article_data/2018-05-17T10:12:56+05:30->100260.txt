Kochi: The 62nd   will be held at  , Thiruvananthapuram on June 5 and 6 and will be a tribute to the former   chief   who passed away recently.

 
 
 In the annual general body meeting which was presided over by Athletics Federation of India (AFI) secretary general   here on Wednesday, it was decided to hold Olympian Suresh Babu Memorial 8th Kerala State Youth Athletics Championships along with the state senior meet.
 
 The KSAA was forced to advance the state meets as the AFI has decided to advance the 58th National Inter-State Senior Athletics Championships at Guwahati from June 26 to 29 which will serve as final selection trials for Jakarta Asian Games to held from August 18. The last date to enter athletes for the Asian Games is June 30.
 
 The AGM also decided to appoint PP Paul as the state chief coach for the season, according to PI Babu, secretary, KSAA.
 
 The State junior meet will be held at either Palakkadâ€™s new medical college stadium or at Pala municipal Stadium later. The KSAA who could not organise the prestigious Kerala State Inter-District Inter-Club Championships in which record athletes compete for want of sponsors are expected to be held this season. The previous edition was to be hosted by Thiruvananthapuram who conveniently ignored blaming lack of sponsors. The inter-club meet is the only meet in the state in which decent prize-money is given to the medallists.
 
 Babu added the Kiddies project, a favourite project of late Tony Daniel will be implemented this year.
