 During his recent visit to the city, joint managing director of Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC), Ashutosh Rathod, assured that it would start soon after the tender process is over.
 
 The boat club at was expected to start by December 2017. In August 2017, MTDC called for fresh tenders as the previous tender had some discrepancies and was cancelled.
 
 Nature’s Boat Club and water sports centre, former guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal’s pet project, was inaugurated without permission on February 25, 2014 by the then Member of Parliament (MP) Sameer Bhujbal, along with movie stars Salman Khan and Sunil Shetty. The bhoomipujan of a convention centre, adventure sports complex and lake view resort were also performed.
 
 The Rs 72-crore project includes Nature’s Boat Club for Rs 14 crore, a convention centre for Rs 17 crore and an adventure sports complex for Rs 17 crore.
 
 “We had floated a tender for Rs 47 crore. We got permission for Rs 11 crore. We found some problems with the tender document and so decided to cancel the tender and float a fresh one by August-September, but we did not get enough response,” said an official from the tourism department in Mumbai. 
 
  At present, 11 boats of the 47 have got clearance from the environment department. A proposal for clearing the rest of the work has been sent by the MTDC. “The boats are of Euro IV standards and so will not pollute the water. The tender process is under way and so I cannot comment much on the topic. However, I can assure you that we will start it very soon. The boats will not become defunct as there are boat clubs in various places and we are using it wherever there is need like we did at the Sarangkheda horse festival,” Rathod said.
