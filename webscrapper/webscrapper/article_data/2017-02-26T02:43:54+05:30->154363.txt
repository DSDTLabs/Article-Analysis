Vadodara: Bollywood actor  , on her first visit to the city, spoke about social media on the second day of the Vadodara Literature Festival (VLF). 

 “I was not keen on joining social media. Although many people had said, there were already numerous fake online accounts in my name,” she said .
 
 She was in the city to talk about parenting in the digital era. The actor shared experiences from her own life with the crowd consisting of parents and soon-to-be parents.
 
 “One day, I found my son,   (11), on   and was shocked. When I told my husband about it, he said that the family was watching over my son and there was nothing to worry about,” she said. “Now, I have also joined social media and Ranveer is the one who teaches me the do’s and don’ts of the internet. He taught me to be free, but also to not let the trolls affect you or bother you. And most important, do not let anyone bully you.” When asked about the joint family system, she said, “It is very important but it is slowly dying due to the concept of nuclear families. This is sad because the role of grandparents in a child’s life is crucial to his/her well-being.”
 
 Another highlight of the day, was author and mythologist, Devdutt Pattanaik. 
 
 Pattanaik used his trademark wit as he employed various myths to speak about his topic, ‘Truth and Mythology.’ When asked about the VLF initiative, he said, “All literary festivals do grow. The fact that such an initiative has been taken is a good thing, and will certainly contribute to the literary scene of the city.”
 
 A youth run initiative, Applause Vadodara, also held a poetry reading session where dozens of unpublished poets of every age, and gender took part.
