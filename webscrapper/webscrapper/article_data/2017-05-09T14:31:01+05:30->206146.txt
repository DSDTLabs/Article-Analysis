INDORE: Urdu, commonly misconstrued as a language that originated from Islam-dominated countries, is actually an Indian language that originated in military camps of Mughal kings. This theory was shared on Sunday at an exhibition-cum-poetry reading session by a retired military officer. The session was held at Canarys Art Gallery.

 Speaking about his love for the language and sharing the theory of its origin, Colonel Anurag  , who has served the Indian Army for 21 years, told the audience the literal meaning of the word Urdu is military camp.
 
 “When Muslim soldiers from   and other Islamic countries fought alongside Indian soldiers, they mixed the Persian language and Hindi to form Urdu. Urdu’s structure and grammar is quite similar to Hindi, only that Urdu has a wider vocabulary and a different script,” Shukla said while sharing his views about the two languages.
 
 Shukla also recited many of his compositions based on his experiences as an army man, on courage and finding inspiration.
 
 Similar sessions will be held on Tuesday and Thursday where poet   will recite his poems and environmentalists Bhalu Mondhe and Devkumar Vasudevan will speak about challenges in saving of wetlands.
