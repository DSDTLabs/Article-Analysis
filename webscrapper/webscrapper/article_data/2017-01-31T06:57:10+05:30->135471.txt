MUMBAI: Voice samples of two minors accused of kidnapping and killing a  , a three-year-old girl from Nagapada, last month for a ransom of Rs 1crore, have matched the voices recorded when they had allegedly made phone calls for extortion, according to sources in the police.

 Two weeks ago, officials from the state forensic science laboratory at Kalina had collected the voice samples of the minor boys who are lodged at the Dongri remand home.
 
 A senior police officer told TOI that as per the initial report of the voice samples, they have learnt from the lab that the voice sample has matched that of the conversations of the two boys which had been recorded. The  , a 17-year-old, lived in the same building as the girl and was known to her. He had administered chloroform to the girl. It was stolen from a the laboratory of a college in south Mumbai where he studied. Soon after the girl lost her conscious, she started bleeding from the nose. The accused panicked and strangled her using the wire of a cellphone charger. Later, he threw her body on the terrace of an adjoining building from where it was recovered a fortnight later.
 
 The police have more than two dozen recorded conversations from the girl's father. Du ring the voice sample test, the two boys were asked to read out the transcripts of the conversa tions and this reading was recorded. The test was conducted within the premises of the Dongri remand home. Though the kidnappers had killed the girl on December 5, they made it seem as if she was alive and was being held captive. They kept calling her father and demanded Rs 1 crore to release her. Subsequently , the ransom amount was brought down to Rs 28 lakh. The boys were arrested on December 24.
