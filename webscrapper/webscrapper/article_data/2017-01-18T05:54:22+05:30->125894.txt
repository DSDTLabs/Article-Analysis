KOLKATA: One hundred fifty security personnel, including the   and local police in riot gears, and three vans full of additional forces were deputed for the nomination process at   in Garden Reach on Tuesday.

 Four years ago, it was around this time that sub-inspector Tapas Chowdhury was shot dead after two groups of students clashed with each other when the nomination process was on.
 
 “There was no major chaos on Tuesday. Students from both the   and   Chhatra Parishad filed their nominations by 2pm,” said DC (port) Sudip Sarkar. Sources said more cops are likely to be deputed on the day of election.
 
 “The process went smoothly. All our candidates were given protection by senior officers from port division,” said Junaid Khan, a local CP leader. “We want such protection even on the day of election on January 28,” he said.
 
 The students, though, found the security ring daunting. “If this is what happens on the day of nominations, do you think we would care to turn up on the election day to cast our votes?” wondered a student.
 
 So, how specific were the arrangements? Those entered from the   and took the right turn towards Paharpur Road saw three police vans full of cops waiting 200 metres from the college. This formed the first layer of security. No car or bike was allowed to be parked close to the college gates.
 
 At the gates, senior officers from the Port division waited in their official vehicles along with the RAF personnel. No one, they claimed, would be allowed entry without an ID card. “You need to seek an appointment with the principal even if you are a reporter,” said an officer. In the third layer, the cops positioned themselves on the grounds near the college.
