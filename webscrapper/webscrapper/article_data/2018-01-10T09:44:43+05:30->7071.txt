CHANDIGARH:   Campus Student Council (PUCSC) members have demanded timely results of the   of the examination papers. The council members on Tuesday submitted a memorandum to the dean university instructions demanding setting up of a committee to frame guidelines so that the results are not delayed. 

 “Students in Panjab University are facing lot of problems due to delay in the declaration of results. In many cases it has been observed that the result of re-evaluation is declared after students re-appear for the exams. So, the purpose of re-evaluation is defeated,” said PUCSC secretary   who submitted the memorandum. Sood added that it is an economic burden on the students and demanded that a committee should be formed to make guidelines so that the students don’t have to suffer. The matter has also been raised in the meetings of the governing bodies. In the last senate meeting, the issue cropped up while discussing the migration cases. It was then that the senate decided to form a committee especially to deal with the migration cases. 
 
 On Tuesday, PUCSC joint secretary Karanbir Singh   also submitted a memorandum demanding infrastructure for the disabled students. “The differently-abled students are facing a lot of problem in terms of accessibility in the university. The university should create infrastructure for them. Ramps should be made in the different departments for the disabled and the washrooms should be made disabled-friendly,” said Randhawa. 
 
 “There are students who are afflicted by polio in their leg and their classes are being held on the first or the second floor. The students are left with no option but to take the stairs painstakingly,” added Randhawa.
