MUMBAI: Eighty-six-year-old   resident Uma Bose, who reached St Anne’s Church polling centre in Pali Hill with the help of a walker, said voting was every person’s moral responsibility. 

 Bose was among the hordes that turned up at polling centres across the western suburbs of Bandra,  ,   and Kalina—the turnout perceptibly higher than in 2012. 
 
 The H-West Ward of Bandra, Khar and Santacruz has the highest number of active resident associations. 
 
 Politically, even though BJP candidates overtook Congress in both the Lok Sabha as well as Assembly elections in Bandra West, the trend is unlikely to hold in civic polls.
 
 Political observers said this time, Congress corporators are once again likely to lead. Congress’s two-time corporator Asif Zakaria, sitting corporator Karen D’Mello and another former corporator Kavita Rodrigues, who are in the fray, stand a good chance, they added. 
 
 “In municipal elections, one always votes in favour of a candidate rather than a party considering that he or she is responsible for passing or approving policies or proposals that concern citizens’ daily lives —be it roads, solid waste or open spaces. Both the existing corporator from our ward and the neighbouring wards (Congress) have been very approachable,” said AGNI trustee Shyama Kulkarni. The BJP has fielded citizen activists from the minority community, Dereyk Talker. Bandra’s Darryl D’Monte said even at 8.30am, people had to queue up for 20 minutes. “However, it was due to delimitation that many people could not find their booths, which made it look like a bigger turnout,” he said.
 
 In H-East Ward of Kalina, too, crowds began to gather since early in the morning.
