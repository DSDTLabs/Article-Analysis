BOKARO: The state government along with West Bengal's government have jointly asked   ( ) officials to keep releasing water constantly to avoid reaching the danger mark and   like situations due to incessant rainfall. 

 This step was taken by the   (DVRRC), a joint committee of West Bengal, Jharkhand and Damodar Valley Corporation. It is also the first time that such guidelines have been issued to Tenughat dam. The committee has assessed that in the past, Tenughat dam authorities usually opened all the 10 gates when the water level touched the danger mark, especially during the monsoon season. It would cause floods in many areas as the river passes through several districts of the state and a majority of West Bengal's areas would be affected.
 
 "DVRCC has issued guidelines and asked us to keep discharging water modestly to avoid repeat of past situations where all the gates of the dam were opened. It had caused flood in the damodar river. Following instructions, we have opened three sluice gates and one radial gate before the water-level touched the danger mark," A K Jha, executive engineer, Tenughat dam said.
 
 The gates will be opened till the water level decreases to 838 feet from the present 843 feet. Constant discharge of water will help prevent rise in water-level in the dam and prevent floods. However, opening of four gates has also increased the river's water-level and residents have been asked not to go near it, Jha added.
 
 damodar river is the biggest river in this region. This step will help the residents as well, who reside near the river and usually face floods during rainy season. Many of the areas get submerged with rise in level of damodar river.
