MYSURU: Five youths, including three students, were arrested on Wednesday for robbing a   worth Rs 19,500 from an Amazon   on February 4.

 In a similar incident in Bengaluru, a gym trainer had killed a Flipkart delivery man for a smartphone in December, 2016.
 
 M Sanath, 20, a mechanical   in Vidyavardhaka College of Engineering, booked the headphone on Amazon and opted for cash-on-delivery. When he got a call from delivery executive Mahesh on Feb 4, Sanath summoned him to a secluded place on Outer Ring Road near Mansi Nagar in east Mysuru.
 
 Sanath teamed up with his friends – Owais Khan, 19, a diploma student; Ismail Khan, 19, a school dropout; Syed Saif, 19, who works in goods yard and a 16-year-old student – to execute the plan.
 
 As planned, the delivery man was summoned to Mansi Nagar on February 4 evening. Sanath and the minor boy threw chilli powder on Mahesh and took away the consignment. The other three members were waiting for them in a car.
