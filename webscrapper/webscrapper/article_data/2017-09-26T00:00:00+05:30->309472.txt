One of the central themes of director Prakash Jayaram’s release this week,  , is the relationship between a grandfather and his grandson, played by   and Darshan, respectively.

 While the images of the two capture the family dynamics perfectly, Prakash says that it took him a little while to convince the veteran actor to play an 80 year old. 
 
 “Initially,   sir was sceptical about playing a character far beyond his years, but the role intrigued him and he agreed to do a look test before signing up. As a theatre actor, Devaraj sir has played older characters earlier and that is one of the reasons he was eventually open to the idea. His team worked on the look, including the prosthetics, and once he saw that he could convincingly pull it off, Devaraj sir agreed to be a part of the film,” explains Prakash.
