Comedian   has been juggling between the shoot of   and his upcoming film 'Firangi' which seems to have taken a toll on his health. Kapil, who has been going through a rough patch ever since his mid-air fight with former co-actor Sunil Grover, fell sick last night on the sets of his TV show. 
 
 For the episode that had to be shot,   and director   were to make an appearance for promoting their film 'Jab Harry Met Sejal', which is scheduled to release on August 4. However, Kapil started to feel uneasy backstage and had to leave the shoot to see a doctor. 
 
  
  
 The shooting for the episode, hence, was stalled. And SRK had to return home. Kapil is admitted in the hospital currently and has his family by his side, said his fellow comedian  . 
  
 When contacted, Kiku Sharda told TimesofIndia.com, "Yes, Shah Rukh Khan was shooting in the Film City vicinity for some promo shoot last night. By the time he came on the sets, Kapil had already left for a checkup. He was feeling uneasy and the doctors advised him to get admitted. Kapil is still in the hospital and his family is with him. Now our regular shooting is on 11th and 13th July, but I don't know which film's star cast will be visiting our sets."
  
 Kapil was admitted to the hospital a few week ago as well for high BP and low sugar. We wish him a speedy recovery.
