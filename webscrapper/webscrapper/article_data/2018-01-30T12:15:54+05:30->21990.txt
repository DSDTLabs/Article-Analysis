CHARMINAR: Protected monuments in and around Old City, including heritage structures like Charminar and Golconda, have fallen prey to rampant vandalism over the years.

 While visitors etch their names on the walls of these monuments, these sites have also become hotspots for disposing garbage.
 
 
 Officials said incidents of vandalism have been on the rise, and even world heritage sites such as Charminar, Qutub Shahi Tombs and Golconda have not been spared.
 
 These famous monuments have been suffering from vandalism throughout its interior corridors and stairways. Looking at the lack of action on people who vandalise these heritage entrance of the monument. So, it is hard to keep a tab on visitors who damage the structure, as there are so many people visiting each day,” said  , a bangle shop owner near Charminar.
 
 While admitting that there was an acute shortage of monument attendants, senior ASI officials maintained that it was not humanly possible to stand guard at every monument.
 
 “A better option would be to sensitise visitors against defacing or destroying heritage structures,” said an official.
 
 The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was pulled up recently when a Parliamentary Estimates Committee raised the issue of shortage of security personnel at heritage sites.
 
 The committee pointed out that as the ASI was facing a shortage of monument attendants across the country and it was forced to depend on police, leading to huge expenditure.
