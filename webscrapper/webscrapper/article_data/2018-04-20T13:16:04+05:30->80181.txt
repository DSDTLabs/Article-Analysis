PANAJI: The   party plans to use the current disillusionment with the   government to build momentum for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The party has begun preparations and has been holding informal discussions with party workers to identify issues it can use to corner the current government.

 Trying to build on the anti-incumbency sentiment, the state Congress plans to launch campaigns to take on the government regarding issues pertaining to the central and state government, Goa desk-in-charge A Chella Kumar said. “There is a lot of anger against BJP’s decisions. We will expose them one by one,” he said.
 
 In the last week itself, local Congress members have been vocal and highlighted several issues to try and build opposition against the current coalition government. If Goa Pradesh Mahila Congress Committee president Pratima Coutinho led a protest on Thursday against the rising crime graph for sexual assaults, former Calangute MLA Agnelo Fernandes has been using the angst against the planning and development authorities to challenge Calangute MLA Michael Lobo.
 
 “We are on track for the 2019 Parliament elections,” Kumar said speaking to TOI. 
 
 Brushing aside the BJP’s taunts of the Congress being headless after Goa Pradesh Congress Committee ( ) president Shantaram Naik submitted his resignation, Kumar said, “We haven’t yet accepted his resignation. Hence, till the next president is appointed, Naik remains president.” 
 
 Kumar said the   was trying to avoid the fact that the coalition government in Goa remains “headless” in the absence of chief minister Manohar Parrikar who has been out of the country for nearly two months.
