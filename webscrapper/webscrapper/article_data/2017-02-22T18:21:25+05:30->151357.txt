Angraag Mahanta, popular by his stage name Papon, was in the city recently for a concert. Starting his journey from folk music, Papon rose to stardom thanks to his many hit songs like Moh Moh ke Dhaage and Humnava. Papon who was in Indore for the first time, says, “more than a decade since I started performing and the journey has been overwhelming. I believe it is just the beginning. I don’t consider anyone as my competition in industry because everyone’s voice is different. But I really admire artistes like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Jagjit Singh for the versatility they bring to music.”About folk music, Papon says, “It is very important to preserve folk music and it can be done only when people listen to it. I have amalgamated folk music with rock and electronic, etc, for the same reason. By doing this, I am able to bring folk music on record. I don’t believe that folk music shouldn’t be mixed with any other form of music, because music has no boundaries. I want to travel across the world and perform in various music festivals so that I can meet new people and also promote the rich musical heritage of our country, which is in the form of folk music. That's the same reason I like performing at concerts.”
