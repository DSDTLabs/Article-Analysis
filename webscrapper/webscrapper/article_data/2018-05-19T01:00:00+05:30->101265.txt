 Not seen much on screen these days, Govinda’s last two releases ' ' and 'Happy Ending', failed to impress his fans. “In 'Kill Dil' I had a negative role and perhaps my fans couldn’t accept me as a villain. My acting in the films was appreciated, though. I have just finished shooting for 'FryDay' and ' ', in these films my fans would see the old masti wala Govinda,” he said, adding, “By Gods grace, whatever acting work I have done is because of the blessings of gurus like respected   ji,   ji and Kriti bhaiyya (Kumar, his elder brother). I always used to discuss with Kriti bhaiyya before going for any shooting.” 
 Talking about the current crop of actors, Govinda is highly impressed with  . “I have worked with him in Kill Dil and find him extremely talented. As far as   is concerned, he is doing my types of films but not my type of acting. He should be more versatile,” he advised.
