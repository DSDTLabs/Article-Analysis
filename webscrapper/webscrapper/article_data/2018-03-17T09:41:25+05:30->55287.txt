Parmar had won on BJP ticket from Rajkot rural constituency in 2002. However, after his term ended, he did not get ticket to contest polls in 2007.
 
 Rathod in his application alleged that Parmar had been using his old MLA’s letterheads to influence the officers and expedite work in government department, which was illegal. He also submitted a letter written by Parmar to district registrar on July 14, 2016. Rathod claimed that he got the copy of the letter under Right to Information (RTI). Rathod demanded that a FIR be lodged under State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act against Parmar.
 
 Rajkot ACP (west)   said, “We have received the application and we are verifying the documents submitted as evidence.”
 
 Parmar said, “I generally use former MLA, but by mistake my clerk may have used my old letterhead without my knowledge. Rathod may have submitted one such letter where I have requested registrar to help the poor.” He also claimed that he had evidence of corruption against Rathod.tnn
