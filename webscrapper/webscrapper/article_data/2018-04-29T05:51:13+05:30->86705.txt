AHMEDABAD: A 19-year-old youth was apprehended by city   officials and was handed over to Anandnagar police for further probe. The accused had allegedly misbehaved with the staff on duty and had refused to cooperate.

 According to Anandnagar police,  , a head constable with A Division traffic police station, was on a traffic drive near Vastrapur railway crossing on Friday morning. At that time, a youth had come from opposite direction on a bike. The youth had not worn helmet and was talking on phone. Thus, he was stopped and a challan was prepared for multiple offences.
 
 “The youth allegedly refused to cooperate and roughed up the cops present there. He also refused to hand over his driving licence or accompany the staff to police station. He was later brought to Anandnagar police station where he was identified as Akash Gupta, a resident of Shivam Priory, Makarba,” said an Anandnagar police official.
 
 Traffic branch officials said that they have adopted a tougher stance against those indulging in physical assault on policemen on duty. “Due to the   camera network, the incidents of altercations have gone down but this is the fifth incident in about 15 days. We are contemplating sterner action against habitual offenders,” said an official.
