Trichy: Desiya Thanninthiya Nathigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam state president P   has criticised chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami for failing to keep his word on fulfilling the longpending demands of the farming community. 

 He pointed out that during the first phase of their protest in Delhi, the chief minister had promised to do the needful to waive off crop loans. However, stating the financial position of the state, he has now reversed his stand, the farmers’ leader alleged. 
 
 On Tuesday, the farmers protesting at Jantar Mantar since July 16 met the CM at Tamil Nadu House in Delhi during his visit to the capital to participate in the swearing-in ceremony of Ramnath Govind as the 14th President of India. Ayyakannu and others reminded him about the unattended demands and his assurances. “However, the CM said he was not in a position to address any of their demands including waiver of crop loans pending against nationalised banks,” he said.
 
 “Chief Minister said that the state had lost 70 per cent of tax revenue due to GST and revenue loss to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore after shutting down various Tasmac outlets along highways and attached bars across the State. Moreover, waiver of loan dues pending against nationalised banks were under the purview of the Union government. State government had nothing to do with it”, said Ayyakannu adding that they were totally disappointed with his statements.
 
 However, he thanked the chief minister for his affirmative reply on a request to create a canal in such a way as to redirect flood water from Maruthaiyaru towards Karaivetti lake in Ariyalur district. If this materialised, as much as one lakh hectares of agriculture land could be irrigated, he added.
