Vadodara: The Medical Council of India (MCI) has given nod to increase the intake for MBBS seats at Baroda Medical College by 70 seats. 

 “MCI has informed on its website that we have received the nod to offer 250 MBBS seats from academic year 2018-19,” said Dr A T Leuva, dean of Baroda Medical College. 
 
 MCI’s executive committee had met on December 14. “Now, MCI will inform about its decision to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, government of India which in turn will intimate us about the decision,” said Leuva. 
 
 According to Dr Hemant Mathur, dean of Faculty of Medicine, a four member team of MCI assessors had visited the medical college on Dec 5-6 and prepared report after taking into consideration all the aspects as per MCI rules.
 
 In July last year, MSU’s syndicate members had cleared a proposal to increase the intake of MBBS seats after a special faculty meeting at Faculty of Medicine had recommended that the seats be increased from present 180 to 250. 
 
 A similar exercise was carried out in 2010 as well. But MCI had pointed out infrastructure lacunae at the college.
