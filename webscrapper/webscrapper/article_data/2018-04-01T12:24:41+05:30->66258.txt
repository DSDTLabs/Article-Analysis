MYSURU:   was a ruler who not only respected the principle of equality but also fought against exploitation of vulnerable sections of the society, said  , president of the Bahumukhi Trust. “Tipu’s   has been marred by vested interests,” said Gangadhar.

 Pointing to some of Tipu’s accomplishments as a ruler, Gangadhar added, “Besides initiating rejuvenation of lakes and ponds, Tipu carried out various developmental projects.”
 
 Gangadhar, who was at the release of the book, ‘Why Should Tipu be an inspiration?’ penned by Mahesh Irasavadi, said, “Tipu was someone who fought exploitation.”
 
 BR Rangaswamy, meanwhile, pointed to the essentially pluralistic polity of Tipu. “If one observes Tipu’s reign, he or she will learn that he did not discriminate against any religion,” Rangaswamy added.
 
 Lauding the book for illumining hitherto unknown facets of the ruler, Rangaswamy said, “Tipu was not a fanatic as he is made out to be. Tipu built a state that promoted equality.”
 
 Questioning the society’s reluctance to recognise Tipu Sultan, convener of the Dalit Sangarsha Samiti Chornahalli Shivanna said, “The society accepts Rama, who sent his wife to the forest, and  , who gambled his wife Draupadi away, but has a problem accepting Tipu, who pledged his sons for the country.”
