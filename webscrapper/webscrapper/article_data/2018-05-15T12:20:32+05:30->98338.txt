TRICHY: In a first among municipal corporations in the state, Trichy Corporation on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with   ( ) to come out with a detailed project report (DPR) for building a 100 TPD (tonnes per day) biogas bottling plant using organic municipal solid waste. 

 The civic body has planned to produce bottled Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) that can be used as alternate fuel post the implementation of biogas bottling plant under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode.
 
 As CLRI has been guiding more than 33 pilot biogas plants across  , it is said that Trichy Corporation approached CLRI to draft a DPR for 100 TPD biogas bottling plant by making use of 70 tonnes of organic waste generated by the city each day.
 
 “Methane gas for cooking purpose and CNG to be used as alternate fuel can be bottled in the proposed plant for which land is yet to be identified. Required fund for the project can be ascertained only after the DPR is prepared by CLRI,” corporation commissioner N Ravichandran said.
 
 The plant which would come up on 0.5 acre land can produce 4,143.75 kg of methane gas and as many as 300 CNG cylinders per day. Corporation has planned to pursue preliminary measure for identifying quality organic waste, mostly the food waste from markets and hotels, to be supplied as raw material for the proposed plant.
 
 The DPR for the plant is likely to be completed by CLRI in the next three months and the institute may offer technical support throughout the implementation of the plant. The MoU was signed in the presence of Dr B Chandrasekaran, director of CSIR-CLRI and N Ravichandran, corporation commissioner, Trichy.
