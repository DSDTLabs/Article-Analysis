Tirupur: The office of the city police commissioner is now equipped with a modern control room as part of strengthening the surveillance system to curb the increasing crime rate.

 City police commissioner P Nagarajan inaugurated the facility, along with introduction of point of sales (PoS) service to collect fines under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, on Friday. 
 
 The modern control room can access vigilance through around 95 CCTV cameras, but it won’t any longer directly receive calls from the emergency toll free number 100, said a senior police officer.
 
 Earlier, the calls made to the emergency toll free number were received directly at the control room. But now that the state police have centralised the service, all the calls would be received at a common control room in Chennai from where officials would alert the concerned police jurisdiction with details such as the location of the call. “Even video clippings could be sent to the concerned police jurisdiction,” the officer said.
 
 Presently, 47 junctions in the city are under CCTV cover and works are on to bring the remaining 46 junctions under the CCTV surveillance system.
 
 The state transport commissionerate had provided the city police Rs 14.5 lakh from the road safety enhancement fund to install 38 CCTV cameras in the first phase and another Rs 12 lakh in the second phase.
 
 “We have installed as many as 47 CCTV cameras in the first phase, with nine of them funded by the public. Footages are monitored at the control room. The work to install 46 CCTV cameras in the second phase is going on,” the officer said.
 
 The CCTV footages can be stored for a month and it would come handy to solve crime cases as well as regulate the traffic, the officer added.
 
 The city police also received 14 PoS machines on Friday. They were given to police personnel deputed to charge fines under the Motor Vehicle Act.
