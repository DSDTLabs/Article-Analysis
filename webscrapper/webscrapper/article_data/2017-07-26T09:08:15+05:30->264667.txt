THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   state president   reiterated his stance that the corruption in   was only a financial fraud committed by an individual and the party doesn't have any role in it. In a letter sent to all office-bearers of the party till the local level on Tuesday, Kummanam said it has already been proven that the main perpetrators of the crime had no relation with BJP. 

 "It is a fact that a worker misused the name of the party for committing financial fraud. We have taken the maximum possible disciplinary action in a case like this by expelling the erring worker. If any further steps need to be taken, it is the responsibility of the government and the judiciary," said Kummanam in the letter. He cautioned workers about the move to paint BJP as a corrupt party by exaggerating a simple incident.
 
 "We have taken up the mission to elevate the country that had been eclipsed by corruption and desperation to the leadership of the world.  , who is respected by the entire world, is leading the mission.  , who is heading the BJP, is the one who has declared a no-compromise war against graft. It may be recalled that political opponents have so far not been able to level even a single allegation of corruption against the Modi government. The desperation from this has led to exaggerating an isolated incident out of proportion," he wrote.
 
 Kummanam, however, admits that certain unwanted elements have grown in the party by making use of the shade of the governance at the Centre. "Those which have come to our notice have been uprooted. If we notice more such elements, they too will be weeded out," he wrote. He said the delay in cleansing the system is owing to the democratic character of the party and asked the local workers not to lose their heart over the controversies.
 
 The state president said there was mystery behind levelling fresh allegations against the spending of money during previous assembly election, now.
