TIRUNELVELI: The   (TWAD) board has sought close to Rs 60 lakh from the state government to manage the drinking water supply shortage during the summer. Senior   board officials told TOI that the board requires 11.8 crore litres a day to meet the drinking water supply requirements of 28.45 lakh people through the 27 combined drinking water supply schemes.

 “We should supply 55 litres a day per person in rural areas (panchayat), 70 to 90 litres a day to every resident in town panchayats, 90 litres per person residing in municipalities where Underground Drainage (UGD) scheme has not been implemented and 135 litres to people living in municipalities where UGD has been implemented,” the official said.
 
 He added that they have sought funds as water level in   and   dams is dropping fast, as water has been released for pisanam paddy season. The officials fear that the total water supply in the 113 infiltration wells on the course of   River will come down by 20 per cent in April and May.
 
 Funds they have sought are primarily for diversion of the river towards the 113 infiltration wells. “During summer, the flow of water will be very less in the river and will be away from the infiltration wells. By diverting water to the infiltration wells we will be able to reduce the supply shortage by 10 to 15 per cent,” said another official.
 
 The official said that the water diverted to the sand beds close to the infiltration wells will improve feeds to the wells. Funds they have sought also include to clear the silt that got deposited close to the infiltration wells when Thamirabarani flooded during Cyclone Ockhi due to the heavy rains in the catchment areas upstream.
 
 Proposal seeking the said funds has been prepared after a week-long field study conducted at all the infiltration wells and has been submitted to the managing director of the TWAD board on Thursday. Even if sanctioned, these measures would be able to sustain water supply only till
