You will forget your phone when you watch the second half of  , says  , the lead actor of the film.   says that the film, which is all set to hit the screens today, has a super-fast second half. He explains, “Of late, when we go to the theatre to watch a film, there too, we meddle with our mobile phones. We tend to check the phone quite often. But while you are watching the second half of this film, you will not get time to touch your phone. The screenplay is gripping and very fast-paced. The strength of this film lies in its second half. You will probably forget everything else during the climax portions. There are several edge-of-the seat thrilling scenes.”

 This will be Vijay Sethupathi’s first mega-commercial project, directed by a senior director like KV Anand. About the script he says, “Kavan’s script came as a surprise to me. The content has heroism — something that I have not attempted so far. The dialogues will also be one of the high points of the film, and the best part is that all the dialogues will be apt for the current political scenario. Like all   films, this film, too, has a social message that has been conveyed in a complete entertainment package. I play a media person in this out-and-out commercial entertainer. The film revolves around the problems media professionals face; how the hero overcomes those hurdles forms the crux.”
 
 Vijay Sethupathi sports a different look for his role: he has long hair, for one. “We are actors. We can adapt to any different look for the sake of the story and the character. As an actor, I always feel that each and every character in my films has to be distinct. The character   that I play in Kavan will be one such unique role in my career.”
