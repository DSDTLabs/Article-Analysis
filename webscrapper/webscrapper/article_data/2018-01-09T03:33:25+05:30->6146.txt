NEW DELHI: The first case of theft on the newly-inaugurated   was reported on Monday. Pickpockets targeted a foreigner and decamped with his wallet and personal documents.

 The victim, a student and a resident of Noida, told cops that he was on his way to meet his friend in   when the snatching took place. According to the police, the incident came to light when the victim, a Congo national, informed them that his study materials and personal documents were stolen on the newly-inaugurated metro corridor.
 
 “This was my first time on the Magenta Line. I didn’t even realise when the snatchers took away my wallet. It must have taken place when I was getting off the metro,” victim Amel Natayel told cops. “I was going to a friend’s place for group studies,” he added.
 
 The victim realised that his belongings and wallet were missing when he got down at Okhla Vihar metro station. “I immediately raised an alarm and informed the CRPF staff present at the station. They suggested that I get a complaint registered and directed me to the police station,” Natayel said.
 
 The victim then approached cops and told them what had happened. A senior police officer said that a case has been registered and teams have been formed to probe the matter. “We have detained a few usual suspects and are questioning them. CCTV footage from the station as well as the train compartment is being scanned to ascertain the sequence of events,” said a senior police officer.
 
 This, cops said, is the first case of theft reported on the Magenta Line and all proper measures are being taken to prevent any such incident from taking place again.
