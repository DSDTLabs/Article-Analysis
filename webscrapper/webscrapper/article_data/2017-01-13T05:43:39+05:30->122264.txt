VIJAYAWADA: Even as   P Ashok Gajapathi Raju has announced that the   will be named Amaravati airport,   has now urged the central government to name it as  . 

 Speaking after inaugurating the new terminal and laying the foundation for extension of runway on Thursday, Naidu said: "We want to promote Amaravati, the brand name of the AP capital. And, NTR is our leader who belonged to this place. The people should remember him forever." To this, Ashok Gajapathi Raju replied that if the state assembly passes a resolution to this effect, he would discuss the issue in the Union cabinet for necessary approval.
 
 The newly-built terminal, Naidu said, would be useful to entrepreneurs apart from helping farmers to export their produce. He requested the civil aviation officials to build an air freight station near the airport. "About 100 acres of land is available at Veerapanenigudem which is 8 km away from here. I can construct wonderful roads and give them to you," he added.
 
 Prior to Naidu's address, Raju clarified that the new terminal is a transit terminal and not a temporary one. "There is a difference between both. Once the permanent terminal is built, this will be used as a cargo terminal," the union minister said.
 
 Union ministers M Venkaiah Naidu, Bandaru Dattatreya, Y S Chowdary, AP assembly speaker Kodela Sivaprasada Rao, Airports Authority of India chairman G P Mahapatra and others attended the event. 
 
 Venkaiah Naidu showered praise on the chief minister, saying he knows in advance what Narendra Modi will do. "Chandrababu has the knack of grabbing an opportunity wherever available. What Prime Minister Narendra Modi will do tomorrow morning, Chandrababu Naidu will get to know this evening and will see if AP can benefit from it."
