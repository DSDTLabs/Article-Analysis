Singer  , who won the Mirchi Music Award this year for Female Vocalist of The Year for her song 'Gilehriyaan' in 'Dangal' has set her sights on the big screen now.

 The 27-year-old singer will be starring in debutant filmmaker Sidharth Achara’s Indo-Canadian venture. The movie is about a girl who becomes an online singing sensation, which is exactly how Jonita’s life panned out as she came in the spotlight for her renditions of popular songs on the internet. Talking about it, the singer says, “I was on tour when I was approached for the film. Since then, there have been a lot of discussions because I didn’t want to deviate my attention from singing. But the plot and subject matter were relatable, so it seemed like I should give it a shot.” Will her experience doing shows and facing the camera for videos help her with acting? “I think it does contribute to making the process a little less nerve-wracking, but it’s going to be a new experience.”
