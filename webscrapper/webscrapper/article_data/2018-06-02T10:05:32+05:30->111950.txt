CHENNAI: City corporation officials on Friday began clearing   in  , which is expected to resettle families and clear the key stretch of automobile spareparts shops and garages and also provide an unhindered link for commuters to Pudupet and beyond. 

 
 The exercise involves relocation of nearly 450 families over a few days and began with 45 families being resettled in the   (TNSCB) colony in Perumbakkam. The eviction on Friday is part of a drive which began with clearing of South and West Cooum Roads a few weeks ago. "Lining almost the entire stretch of road are auto spareparts shops whose owners have 'houses' right on the banks of the Cooum," said an official.
 
 The shops and garages will be removed later this month, the official said. "We had allotment orders for only 387 families as they had attended the topographical survey done by the PWD. But on beginning the eviction, it was realised that an additional 63 families, which were not enumerated, were present. "Allotment orders have been provided to 450 families of who 63 have been given temporary orders."
 
 The families with temporary allotment orders were not given the shifting allowance of 5000 each and a few protested on Perumbakkam Main Road. Officials said the sum would be given after the issuance of permanent allotment orders, a process involving PWD, corporation and TNSCB.
