AURANGABAD: The Brahmin Yuva Samiti (Brahmin youth committee) here has condemned the vandalization of Ram Ganesh Gadkari’s bust in Pune and demanded that the playwrights busts or statues be installed at city auditoriums.

 The Samiti described the act as an insult to art and culture as well as to the Brahmin community, and demanded strongest possible action against the miscreants involved in the crime.
 
 “We condemn the cowardly act of pulling down the bust of a great artist in Pune, which is the cultural capital of Maharashtra. Gadkari is considered a legend in the field of art and culture in the state and therefore the destruction of his bust is a blot on Maharashtra,” Vikas Kulkarni, leader of the Samiti said on Wednesday.
 
 The Samiti, which held a special meeting here to protest against the incident, passed a resolution supporting installation of busts or statues of Gadkari in the premises of leading auditoriums in Aurangabad. 
 
 A delegation of the Samiti met Aurangabad police commissioner Amitesh Kumar and demanded that a proper check should be put on people supporting acts of destruction and communal divide. 
 
 Four members of the Sambhaji Brigade and  , who were arrested on Tuesday, were on Wednesday remanded in Pune police custody for two days.
 
 The miscreants had torn down the bust from Sambhaji Garden in the wee hours of Tuesday and dumped it into the Mutha river nearby. The police retrieved the bust from the river on Wednesday.
 
 The Sambhaji Brigade issued a statement justifying the act, arguing that Gadkari had made derogatory remarks against   — son of   — in his play, Rajsanyas, which was written 90 years ago.
