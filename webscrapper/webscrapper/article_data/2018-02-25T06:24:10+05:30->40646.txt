BENGALURU: Hassan deputy commissioner Rohini   Dasari is in trouble as the state government has issued her a show-cause notice for breaching protocol in not receiving and seeing off chief minister   when he was in   earlier this month. 

 The notice dated February 23 said Siddaramaiah was in Shravanabelagola on February 7, when President   had come to inaugurate the Mahamastakabishekha celebrations. However, Sindhuri was neither present to receive the CM nor when he left though he was on an official engagement. As per protocol, the district deputy commissioner and SP should receive the CM and see him off too.
 
  The government asked Sindhuri to give an explanation in three days. She was not available for comment.
