 is ecstatic with the response he received from his fans while promoting his latest film 'Logan' in China, but his friend and fellow actor   jokes it was barely a bunch of protesters. 

 The 48-year-old actor, who is playing the adamantium-clawed mutant in the Marvel film for the last time, took to Twitter to thank his admirers. 
 
  
  
 "Thanks for an amazing visit Beijing! @WolverineMovie @20thcenturyfox," Jackman wrote, alongside a photograph of himself with his fans at the film's premiere there. 
 
  
 To this the 'Deadpool' star gave a reply laced in his classic dead-pan humour, "Pretty sure those are protesters." 
 
 
 And this earned a faux shocked response from Jackman as he retweeted with, "Really.. Guy.. Really? @VancityReynolds." 
 
  
 The first trailer of Reynolds' upcoming film 'Deadpool 2' was unveiled ahead of the world premiere of 'Logan'.
