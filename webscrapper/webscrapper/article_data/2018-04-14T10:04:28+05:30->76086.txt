Meanwhile, some residents of the adjoining housing societies have started vacating their flats. It was learnt that the residents of the nearby societies had paid Rs 30 lakh to Rs 40 lakh to buy 3BHK flats here a few months ago.
 
  
  
 
 “I have a stationery shop near high court. I bought my flat three months ago and paid Rs 32 lakh. After the incident, my family is having sleepless nights. We fear that the same could happen to our building as well,” said   (55), a resident of an adjoining housing society.
 
 “We don’t want to live here anymore. Today we met the developer of our housing society and demanded a refund of our money,” he added.
 
 Not only this, the people who had come here to book flats changed their minds. “My sister-in-law suggested us to but a flat here. So, I, along with my husband, arrived here at 2.30pm on Thursday to see a flat. However, after knowing that an entire tower collapsed at 12:30pm, we felt like saving our lives and leaving the place as soon as possible,” said  , a resident of the Bangalore.
 
 Monica, a resident of an adjoining society, said she did not want to live there anymore.
 
 “The administration must conduct stability tests of the nearby housing societies. We want our money back from the builders. After yesterday’s incident, my whole family is in fear,” said  , who has a flat here.
 
 “I bought flat here three months ago. But now, our lives are in danger,” he added.
