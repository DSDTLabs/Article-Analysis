VADODARA: The main entry and exit gates of Vadodara railway station will change from Tuesday morning. 

 While the gate from the side of   which was so far acting as entry gate will now act as an exit gate and the gate from the side of   depot which was so far acting as an exit gate will now act as the entry gate. 
 
 Officials of the Vadodara railway division of   on Monday said that they are bringing this change to smoothen the traffic movement in the area. 
 
 An official said that converting the exit gate into entry gate will ease the traffic movement as those passengers coming from the city areas will directly enter the station area. 
 
 By doing this, the railway officials are following the old pattern of exit and entry gates which was later changed. 
 
 The success of this experiment will however, depend on how the traffic is managed at the juncture near the   underpass, which is likely to witness a bottleneck when passengers coming out of the railway station area will witness the rush from those commuters who will try to reach the entry gate towards the bus depot.
