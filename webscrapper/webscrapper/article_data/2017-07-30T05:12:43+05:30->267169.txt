MUMBAI: Matoshree's silence on the   row has left several Shiv Sainiks, in Mumbai as well as Thane that are considered the party's stronghold, confused.

 While Saamna on Saturday slammed   leader Abu   and AIMIM MLA Waris Pathan for their refusal to sing `Vande Mataram' under coercion, its tone was subdued, said observers.
 
 The   mouthpiece demanded expulsion of the two MLAs from the state legislative assembly , thus putting the onus on the BJP to initiate action against Azmi and Pathan. The Mumbai BJP too has been, by and large, calm on the controversy. Sena minister Divakar Raote did slam Azmi and Pathan, but his soundbytes, meant chiefly for the media, could hardly stir Sainiks into action, said party sources.
 
 Sainiks on Saturday held demonstrations in Kolhapur and   condemning Azmi and burnt his effigies, even while their Mumbai and Thane counterparts awaited the party leadership's fatwa, a Sena activist from Sewri pointed out.
 
 “Had Balasaheb been alive, he would have hauled up Azmi and Pathan. He would have given 'aadesh' to Sainiks to take the duo to task for opposing the national song,“ he said, on condition of anonymity. “Matoshree's silence is both disquieting and surprising,“ he added.
 
 Many in the Shiv Sena are of the view that Uddhav's silence is not in keeping with the party's aggressive stance of several decades on “patriotic“ issues. A former Sena minister attributed Matoshree's new found restraint to the fact that the party was in power in the state.
