BHIWANDI: A woman has complained to the police that her husband mailed her an instant triple talaq on a Rs 100 stamp paper after months of harassment for dowry.

 After an attempt at rapprochement failed, the man and four members of his family have been booked for dowry harassment. “We have booked the accused under dowry harassment charges and will arrest them soon,” said Kishor Jadhav, senior police inspector of Shanti Nagar here.
 
 In August 2017, the Supreme Court ruled instant triple talaq unconstitutional. In December, the Lok Sabha passed a bill criminalizing the practice and laying down jail term for violaters. It is stuck in the Rajya Sabha.
 
 Acting on the complaint of  , 20, the Shanti Nagar police on Friday booked her husband  , father-in-law  , mother-in-law Julekha, sister-in-law Aafrin and Aafrin’s husband   under Section 498-A (dowry harassment), 406 and 34 of IPC.
 
 Shabnam had said she got married to Sardar, a powerloom worker, in May 2016. Soon after, her husband and in-laws started demanding that she either bring a motorcycle or Rs 50,000 in cash from her maternal home.
 
 When her parents failed to pay up, her husband and inlaws began torturing her over petty issues. Frustrated, she left her marital home in November that year and returned to her parents’ house nearby in Vithal Nagar in Bhiwandi.
 
 Shabnam said she had hoped that her husband would realise his mistake, but instead he posted her a Rs 100 stamp paper on which “talaq” was written thrice.
 
 Upset, she approached Shanti Nagar police station, which referred the case to the Women’s Complaint Centre, where the warring couple was counselled. When it was found that Sardar was not willing to live with Shabnam, the case was referred back to the local police, who booked Sardar and his family members on Friday. “We lodged the case and took legal action when the case was sent back to us,” said Jadhav.
