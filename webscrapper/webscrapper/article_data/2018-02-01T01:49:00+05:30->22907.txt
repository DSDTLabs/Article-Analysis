Pune: For the next 45 days at least, environment litigants from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Goa will have to travel to Delhi to get urgent matters heard by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) after the Supreme Court’s order on Wednesday. 

 The SC order said, “The chairperson of the NGT shall not constitute  , but a division bench consisting of  .”
 
 The green tribunal’s western region bench in Pune has only one judicial member presiding over matters. As such, all   will remain shut till March 12, at least when the NGT bar association’s petition comes up for a hearing before the apex court.
 
 The SC bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice D Y Chandrachud was hearing a petition by the NGT Bar Association (western region) challenging the NGT (Practices and Procedures) Amendment Rules 2017 that allowed even a single member bench to perform judicial functions. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change; registrar general of NGT principal bench; registrar of NGT Pune bench; and the ministry of law and justice are respondents.
 
 There is an overall provision for 40 members at the NGT benches in Delhi, Pune, Bhopal, Kolkata and Chennai. Of these, 34 posts for judicial and expert members are vacant at the regional benches, including Pune’s. As of now, only four judicial members and two expert members are functioning.
 
 Petitioner Saurabh Kulkarni, who heads NGT Bar Association (western region), told TOI, “We have challenged the amended rules of 2017 and a consequential office order by the NGT chairperson on December 5, 2017, on the grounds that the same are ultra vires (beyond one’s legal power/authority) and contrary to the parent statute—the NGT Act, 2010 which does not envisage constitution of single member bench for adjudication of disputes.”
