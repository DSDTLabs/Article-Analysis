TRICHY/CHENNAI: Rebel   leader and independent MLA of R K Nagar, T T V Dhinakaran, on Tuesday said that he is ready for a truce with the ruling EPS-OPS faction if they agree to drop six ministers from the state cabinet and appoint one of the 18 disqualified MLAs from his camp as chief minister of Tamil Nadu. Dhinakaran added that he did not wish to become chief minister himself.

 “Elections can be avoided in Tamil Nadu only if there is a change of guard. Six ministers should be dropped from the cabinet,” Dhinakaran told reporters at Kathiramangalam village in Thanjavur.
 
 However, the nephew of   did not name the six ministers he wanted to be dropped from the cabinet, and left it to media’s guess.
 
 
 
 
 “While I do not wish to become chief minister, let any of the 18 disqualified MLAs be made the chief minister,” Dhinakaran added.
 
 Ever since his revolt and the ruling AIADMK’s general council decision to remove   and Dhinakaran from the post of general secretary and deputy general secretary last year, the TTV camp has been calling both chief minister   and deputy chief minister   as betrayers.
 
 However, the ruling AIADMK sought to ignore Dhinakaran’s offer as “comical”. “Every statement of Dhinakaran has become comical. He is an independent MLA and his political capability is not even known to members of the public at large. We have decided to ignore his statements,” a senior party leader and AIADMK spokesman, who did not want to be named, told TOI.
 
 “No MLA will go behind him (Dhinakaran), especially when they know that they can remain in power for at least 3 more years if they stay in the present set-up,” the spokesman added.
