BHOPAL: When chief minister   was busy promoting sanitation in   on Sunday, he was possibly unaware that over 450 girls of an undergraduate college in neighbouring Panna district are forced to go out of the college premises in the absence of a toilet in their educational institution.

 The sole   located in Ajaygarh tehsil of Panna district has been converted into a storeroom.
 
 The girls are forced to go out to answer nature’s call or have to make do with a small room without roof about 100 feet away from college building, which serves as a makeshift toilet.
 
 College principal AK Singh said, “There is hardly any space in the 4-room college building. About a year back, when the science section was added in the arts college, the girls’ common room was converted into a storeroom. I have informed my superiors about the problems faced by students and the staff members”.
 
 Vinita, a BA first-year student said, “We have to go out to relieve ourselves in groups because boys follow us.” Sanjana, another student, said, “It’s really shameful but we are helpless.”
 
 Singh sounded defensive and said, “We have asked the girls to use the staff room toilet but they prefer to go out.”
 
 Minister in-charge of the district, Lalita Yadav said, “This is not going to be tolerated and a toilet will be made available for the girls at the earliest. I will ensure the construction of toilet within a week”.
