MADURAI: District collector   has constituted special teams to monitor the release of water from the   dam for irrigation at seven points and warned that any person found tapping it illegally should be arrested immediately. The teams comprise a deputy tahsidhar, agriculture officer, PWD officer, luskars and three farmers each. 

  and Metupatti areas staged a protest at the grievance meet presided over by the collector on Friday by showing the withered crops they brought with them. They said that unplanned release of water without following the regular pattern had led to the failure of the crops despite the dams having enough water this year.
 
 State president of   Sugarcane Farmers Association, N Palanichamy, alleged that deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam and minister   were responsible for the failure of agriculture in most parts of Madurai because they ordered the release of water without proper planning.
 
 It was also stated that the water being released from the Vaigai up to Kallanthiri was irregular with the morning supply being higher and then decreasing in the evening, probably due to illegal tapping of water on its route. In all, 900 cusecs was being released from the Vaigai dam under the turn system from Jan 17 onwards up to Kallanthiri, the double crop area where paddy is cultivated on 45,000 acres.
 
 The collector ordered that the special teams should monitor the water at seven specific points — Peranai, Thiruodai, Kattakulam, Andipatti Bungalow, Thodaneri, Alanganallur and Kallanthiri — on a three-hour basis to ensure that it was not tapped. He said that the PWD and agriculture department should avail vehicles for these checks and told the officers that they would also have to take the farmers along and ensure they received their due .
