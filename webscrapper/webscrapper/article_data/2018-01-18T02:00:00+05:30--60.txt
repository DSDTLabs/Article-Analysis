PATNA: A team of Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of state police will visit Kathmandu in Nepal for verifying the background of Nepalese firm Ms Global Trading Concern Private Limited whose 1,070 cartons of wine inside a sealed container imported from Adelaide in Australia was seized at Kashichak in Nawada district for violation of prohibition laws on May 2 last year.

 The container, after getting docked at Haldia port in Kolkata, was enroute to Kathmandu via road when it was seized by police.
 
 The decision was taken after the Patna high court, while hearing a writ petition filed by the firm on Tuesday, ordered the state government to send a police team to Kathmandu to verify the firm’s background before taking any decision on releasing the consignment.
 
 The court granted two weeks’ time to the government for verification of documents and fixed February 1 as the next date of hearing.
 
 Advocate general Lalit Kishore, who represented the state government, told TOI that the decision to send an EOU team to Kathmandu was taken on the court’s directive. “The verification will be done within two weeks,” he said.
 
 Kishore informed the court that police investigation was also going on in this connection. He also submitted that the state did not have any objection to releasing the seized consignment if the high court ordered for that.
 
 Senior advocate YV Giri, Nikhil Kumar Agrawal and Aditi Hansaria represented the firm.
 
 The bench, during previous hearing on January 12, had asked the state government why it was adamant on destroying the consignment. The court had also asked the state government why the entire consignment could not be transported to Nepal with police escort.
