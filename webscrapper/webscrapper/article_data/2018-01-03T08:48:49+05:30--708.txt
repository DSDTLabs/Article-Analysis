THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   (TDB) will consider a proposal to rename Sabarimala Ayyappa Swami Temple as Sabarimala Sri Dharma   Temple in its meeting scheduled for Wednesday. By doing so, the   aims to go back to the original name of the temple which was changed by the previous board led by   leader Prayar Gopalakrishnan.

 Sources said the board led by   leader A Padmakumar would take up the agenda as desired by the LDF government in power. Devaswom minister   welcomed the move and said on Tuesday that if the board changes the name, the devotees would welcome it.
 
 It was ahead of the Mandala season in 2016 that the TDB went for a name change by rechristening the temple as Ayyappa Swami Temple. The changes were made in all documents. Even then, devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran had objected to the move saying that the government was kept in the dark about the name change.
 
 According to sources, the previous board's hasty move was to ensure a favourable verdict in the case pending before the   regarding the entry of women to the temple. One of the key arguments put forward by the petitioners is that other Dharma Sastha temples allow entry of women. The TDB wanted to present that Sabarimala temple was different from other Sastha temples and decided to rechristen the hill shrine.
 
 On Tuesday, Surendran said the proposed change of name wouldn't have any impact on the ongoing case regarding entry of women.
