Saligao: The water resources department has begun work on constructing a retaining   along the Mandovi river at Queg de Velim beach near Reis Magos.

 The work is being undertaken to fortify the river bank against soil erosion caused by the waves. Minister for housing and Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar recently inspected the ongoing work of the retaining wall along the Mandovi river to monitor the progress of the work. Local residents pointed out that the road, passing along the river bank, is also facing the threat of getting washed away. 
 
 Salgaonkar said the government will also build toilets and changing room amenities on the beach stretch. “Benches and a food court will be set up soon,” he said.
