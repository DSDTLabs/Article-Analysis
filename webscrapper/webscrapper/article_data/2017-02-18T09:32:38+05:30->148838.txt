JAIPUR: The perennially loss-making   (Discoms) are seeking community help to tackle the rampant   in the rural areas. They have roped in sarpanchs of the panchayats with the promise that if theft is reduced drastically, then the power distribution companies would ensure round-the-clock power supply.

 The power department is banking on the Bithur model in   where community initiative has helped to reduce transmission and distribution losses considerably.
 
 The villagers complained during a visit of chief minister   that they were getting power only for a few hours and it was found that the major reason for the power break down in the village was due to theft. She asked villagers to come forward and stop power theft due to which the whole village was suffering.
 
 The Bithur model is a community driven initiative against power theft in which a large number of women at Bithur became Urja Mitras. The initiative at Bithur village, which is affiliated to Bhimpura Power Feeder, led to the T&D losses being cut to 21% from 47%. As a result, the villagers are now getting power supply for most of the time. This has encouraged the Discoms to fall back on community to address the issue.
 
 The sarpanch would lead from the front in managing power supply. “If the village gets maximum hours of power supply, naturally the villagers will be happy and the credit will go the sarpanch. Without the participation of community this wide spread illegal practice of theft could not be tackled,” said an official.
 
 Currently the T& D loss, a major part of it constitute theft, is considerably high at 27%. “The loss of above 15 % is considered as abnormal. So we have decided to rope in the grassroot elected representatives in this campaign,” said an official.
