KOCHI: For someone who can grab a mic and sing in front of a huge audience confidently despite not being a trained singer, while thousands of miles away from home would be a tough task. However, Dato' Haji Sahariman bin Hamdan, president of  , did just that during the cultural evening at Homestay and Rural   and Travel Meet 2017. Sahariman, who was at the meet as a buyer, said marketing of homestays is a tricky job and needs a careful approach to make the customers experience the true homestay feel. “We should deliver more than just accommodation in homestays. Accommodation, tourists can find anywhere. But it is in providing experience of the locale that home stays stand apart. In Malaysia, we create our own cultural evenings for our guests by coordinating between small communities of homestays," Sahariman said.

 Sahariman, who visited over 5 homestays in different parts of the state, said more group activities for guests should be planned like playing traditional games together, or making them part of the cooking. “It will help in promoting and sustaining the local cultures as well," he added.
 
 The 32-year-old homestay industry in Malaysia is now a government backed worth 40 million Malaysian ringgits. The country has over 5,900 rooms in the category spread over 348 villages in the 14 states. Around 60-70% of the business caters to domestic tourists. Internationally, majority of guests are from Japan and Singapore.
 
 “Kerala harbors one of the best homestay services in the world, and is on par with the services provided in  .The bed and breakfast deals are common in homestays here, which is not the case elsewhere," said Sahariman.
