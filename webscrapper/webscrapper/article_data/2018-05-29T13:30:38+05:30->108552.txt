Kozhikode: The efforts to identify the source of the   infection has become a daunting task with experts saying that it is difficult to confirm the presence of   virus in   using the currently followed Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests.

 Additional chief secretary (health and family welfare) Rajeev Sadanandan told media persons here on Monday that though fruit bats of the Pteropus genus are the natural reservoir hosts of the virus, the bats can spread the infection only if the virus level was high in their bodies.
 
 “As natural reservoir of the virus, the fruit bats can have virus presence in low levels. But they will be able to spread Nipah infection through body secretions only when the virus level peaks. We can confirm the presence of antibodies to Nipah in the fruit bats samples using PCR tests only when the samples are taken during high virus levels,” he said adding that the virus presence can be confirmed through serology tests and discussions are on with international experts in this regard.
 
 Asked whether the Nipah infection would resurface in Kerala, Sadanandan said, “We should be on guard next year and continue the monitoring process.”
 
 Meanwhile, animal husbandry and forest department teams have been collecting samples from fruit bats at Changaroth and nearby areas where the infection was first reported.
 
 He added that the genetic analysis of the Nipah virus (NiV) isolated from human samples here has shown that the virus strain is similar to the NiV strain responsible for outbreaks in Bangladesh.
 
 “There are two distinct strains responsible for the previous outbreaks in Malaysia and Bangladesh. The virus strain we got here is similar to the Bangladesh strain,” he said adding that the Bangladesh strain of NiV was more dangerous than the Malaysian strain.
