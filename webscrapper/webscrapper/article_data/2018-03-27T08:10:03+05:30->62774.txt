CHENNAI: Following one of the coldest winters in the last decade, the temperature in the city has remained well below normal this month. But the daytime temperature could rise by two or three degrees Celsius from Wednesday, said weathermen. 

 On Monday, the maximum temperature was more than a degree below normal at both Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam. The night (minimum) temperature, however, was in line with normal readings.
 
 As easterly winds from the sea have persisted right from the morning, the daytime temperature remained under check over the last few days. On Sunday, the maximum temperature was 1.5 degrees below the normal temperature of 34.5 degrees Celsius.
 
 "Weather models indicate that offshore winds (blowing from land towards sea) are going to grow stronger. This will weaken the easterly winds that are responsible for cooling the city. As a result, the temperature may rise to 36 degrees Celsius on Wednesday and Thursday," said weather blogger Pradeep John. The offshore winds are growing stronger due to a prevailing high pressure area in the   off the city coast.
 
 Meanwhile weathermen have forecast light rain or thundershowers at isolated places over south coastal Tamil Nadu. Dry weather is likely to prevail over the remaining parts of the state including Chennai.
 
 The met office has forecast a maximum and minimum temperature of 34 degrees Celsius and 25 degrees Celsius in the city on Tuesday. The sky is likely to remain partly cloudy over the next few days.
