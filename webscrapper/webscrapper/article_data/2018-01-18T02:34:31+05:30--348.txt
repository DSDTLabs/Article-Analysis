 “The station will have artwork with a message on greenery. A specialised team of artists have been roped in to execute the work,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications)   (DMRC). 
 
 The pillars of the station on Ring Road will showcase traditional Indian Jali work, which will have backlit installations and night glow vinyl for better aesthetic look at night, he said, adding that the work is expected to be completed within a week.
 
 “Students of a nearby school for girls will also paint seven pillars of the metro corridor near the station. The themes will be reverence for life, spirit of education, love for nature, character building, spiritual unfolding, love for Indian ideals and living for others,” Dayal said.
 
 The recently inaugurated Botanical Garden-Kalkaji Mandir section also depicted India’s rich culture and heritage. Similar efforts will be made on all corridors that are coming up as part of the Phase-III expansion, Dayal said.
 
 DMRC had tied-up with various government bodies/organisations (National Book Trust, Delhi Tourism, Sahitya Akademi, India Habitat Centre, ministry of textiles, etc.) and schools authorising them to use metro premises to promote Indian art, culture, literature, craft, tourism etc.
 
 Stations such as INA (art & craft gallery), Jorbagh (painting/photo exhibition), Mandi House and ITO (artwork panels), Kashmere Gate (bookshop), Vishwavidyalaya (bookshop run by National Book Trust) Patel Chowk (metro museum) etc., are testimony to these associations and offer commuters an altogether different experience, Dayal said.
