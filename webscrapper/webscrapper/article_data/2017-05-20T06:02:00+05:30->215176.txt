 The traffic police have issued an advisory for commuters accustomed to using the NTPC intersection to go towards Nithari, etc and vice versa. 
 
 A diversion has been planned for the commuters approaching the intersection from City Centre, Sector 60, 62, etc because of the digging work on the Sector 60-Nithari carriageway, the adivosory said.
 
 Those coming from Sector 60, 62, etc towards Nithari will get down from the interchange loop of the elevated road.
 
 They will have to drive back for less than 50 metres, take a U-turn and again take the main carriageway towards Nithari again to move towards via Sector 31/25.

 Those commuters who travel from City Centre towards Gijhor chowk and Sector 60 via the NTPC intersection will now have to take a right at the Sector 32/33 T-point, then take a left at the Sector 32/33/53 T-point and travel to their destinations.
 
 Commuters travelling from Sector 60 towards City Centre will do so after taking a left from the service lane of the Iskcon Temple in Sector 33 via the Prakash Hospital road.
 
 The traffic diversion might not be so smooth for commuters as at one point, the traffic coming from Nithari and commuters going towards Nithari will merge before the NTPC intersection on the Sector 24-Sector 25 carriageway.
 
 “We will deploy three or four constables to ensure the traffic flow is not disrupted at the spot where traffic from both the sides are being merged,” traffic inspector Layak Singh said.
