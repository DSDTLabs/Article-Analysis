PUNE: Dry conditions have made a comeback over the state, along with heatwave conditions in Vidarbha. 

 Chances of pre-monsoon showers - which until now have been 49% deficient across Maharashtra between March and May 2017 - have dwindled even further with little possibility of rain in Konkan, Marathwada,   and Vidarbha till May 21.
 
 All Met department stations in the state continue to show deficient pre-monsoon rains, except at Solapur. 
 
 While Mumbai has received no rainfall worth recording this season, Pune has received only 6.5mm rain during the recent spell, as against a normal of 30.7mm.
 
 Pre-monsoon rainfall deficiency in Madhya Maharashtra currently stands at 38%, and that in Vidarbha and Marathwada at 66%. The showers are an important phenomenon between March and May, which is also called the pre-monsoon season. The rainfall not only helps keep summer temperatures low, but also helps farmers prepare land for the upcoming Kharif season.
 
 Meanwhile, heatwave conditions have returned to Vidarbha, where the day temperature on Tuesday was an unusual 46.8 degrees C. 
 
 On Wednesday, the temperature in Vidarbha stood at a scorching 45.4 degrees C. 
 
 "The prevailing anti-cyclone conditions over the Arabian Sea and the high-pressure belt, extending from the Arabian Sea to Central India, has been suppressing rainfall over western parts and Maharashtra, apart from causing heatwave conditions over Vidarbha, among other regions in the country," said a senior   (IMD) official.
 
 Officials stated that anti-cyclonic circulation, prevailing over the region from March this year, was responsible for the suppressed rainfall activity in the pre-monsoon season.
 
 N Chattopadhyay, head of   at IMD, told TOI that pre-monsoon rains help farmers prepare the land for the Kharif season, especially in Vidarbha and Konkan regions that are the rice-growing areas of the state.
