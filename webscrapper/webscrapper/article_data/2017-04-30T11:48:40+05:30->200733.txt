VIJAYAWADA: DGP N Sambasiva Rao on Saturday made it clear that Andhra Pradesh police will not be reinvestigating the   Meera murder case and that they would hand it over to an independent investigation agency outside the state. He said they may request the government to order a CBI probe.

 “We believe that an independent investigation agency should conduct the probe, instead of AP police,” Sambasiva Rao said during a press conference here. He also hoped that the independent investigation will bring out the truth and take the case to its logical conclusion. Echoing Sambasiva Rao,   police commissioner   said that there could be two possible independent agencies – either the Crime Investigation Department (CID) or   (CBI) which may probe the murder case.
 
 However, sources said that, in all likelihood, since CID comes under state DGP, it would most probably be given to CBI. However, the DGP did not mention as to when it might begin citing few technical difficulties in the case.
 
 “There is nothing in our hands anymore. It has been made clear that AP police will not be investigating the case. The purpose is to make sure that people believe the system and it has to be beyond reasonable doubt and the reinvestigation might help in achieving that,” Gautam Sawang said. Initially, the Vijayawada police requested the government to challenge the HC verdict which acquitted Satyam Babu and demanded that the state police take action against the investigation officer. However, the CM rejected the proposal and made it clear that they have to reinvestigate the case.
