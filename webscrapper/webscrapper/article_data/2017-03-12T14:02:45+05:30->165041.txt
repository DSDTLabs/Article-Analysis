NEW DELHI: Punjab   chief Captain   will take the oath for chief minister of the state on March 16 at Raj Bhavan, 12 days before the next hearing in the   (SYL) case on March 28.

 Notably, 
  after the Supreme Court last November said Punjab's 2004 Act terminating the SYL agreement was unconstitutional. 
 
 "Yesterday Prime Minister talked to me. He said whatever you require for Punjab I will be all willing to help," Amarinder told mediapersons today.
 
 Amarinder has been largely credited for the 
  where it got a more-than-comfortable victory, winning 77 of 117 seats. 
 
 He emphasized today that the new government won't go on any witch hunts. 
 
 "No vendetta politics no victimisation, if name comes in investigation we'll see," Amarinder said on being asked if action will be taken against Bikram Majithia, who has been accused of running a drug mafia.
 
 Punjab has an extremely serious problem with drug addiction.
 
 "Psychiatrists needed to tackle drug menace. 2 issues require major attention one is health other is education," Amarinder said.
