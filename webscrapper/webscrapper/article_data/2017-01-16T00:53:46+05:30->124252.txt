Hyderabad: One of the accused in the   dacoity at RC Puram, it turns out, had political aspirations. Sunder Rajaratnam Kangalla, who happens to be an associate of gangster Chhota Rajan, wanted to become a Congress party corporator in Mumbai Municipal Corporation by using the ill-gotten wealth from various robberies he committed.

 Officials said that 41-year-old Sunder was planning to invest Rs 1 crore to Rs 1.5 crore in his political career and was about to be announced as a Congress party nominee from Darvi constituency in Mumbai. Locally, he is well-known for his criminal activities and links with the DK Rao gang. DK Rao is one of the key persons working for Chhota Rajan. He used to employ Sunder and one Pujari to carry out criminal activities. 
 
 “This dacoity yet again exposed the close nexus of criminals and politicians and how the money earned through criminal activities is being used for building their political careers,’’ a senior Cyberabad police officer said. Lakshman and Tukaram, who were involved in the Muthoot Finance dacoity, have close links with Sunder. The accused in various dacoities used to give a share of the booty to Sunder. Police said that out of the 69 CCTV footages they verified, it was only in one photo that the face of one accused was identifiable. The faces of the other gang members were covered in all the other footages.
