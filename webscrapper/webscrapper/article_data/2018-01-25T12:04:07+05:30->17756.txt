 If students find it difficult to understand any technical term, they should split it etymologically for better understanding. Make footnotes and point-wise summaries for important topics so that they can be easily revised a day before the exam. Do not go for a new topic at the time of revision as it may confuse you. Practise the diagrams as they are the most important aspect of the subject and help understand the processes of several topics.
 
 Important diagrams that should not be missed out…

 Last-minute tips for the examinees…

NCERT book is a must for scoring good marks. Students should also practise writing so that they can complete the three-hour paper and also revise it in time.
 
 Things that should be kept in mind while writing the paper…
 
 Before answering questions, students should go through the entire paper and mark the questions they are confident about. Write the correct question numbers for the answers. Don’t bother about doing it in a sequence. Do not leave sheets blank in between your answers. Give diagrams and tables wherever necessary. A well-labelled diagram fetches more marks.
