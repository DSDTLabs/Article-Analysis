VADODARA: Ashok Tailor, the co-accused in cash-for-marks scam of Waghodia-based Sumandeep  , has once again applied for bail in sessions court. 

 Tailor, who was arrested by   (ACB) on February 28, is in the jail since March 6.
 
 Tailor pleaded for bail on the grounds that he suffers from various ailments including heart disease and diabetes. The 60-year-old also said that he had undergone angioplasty in the past and has to go for regular check-up. Besides health grounds, Tailor also sought bail on the grounds that no case was made out against him in the chargesheet filed by ACB as he had neither demanded nor accepted any cash. His application also states that Tailor is neither associated with the university in any way nor he is a public servant. He served the university as a revenue consultant.
 
 Tailor had filed for bail on March 10 too but it was rejected by the sessions court. Later, he moved the high court but withdrew the bail plea later. Tailor, a retired talati, was nabbed along with   alias Bharat Savant and aide of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth founder Dr  . According to ACB, Tailor was with Savant when he had gone to collect Rs 20 lakh cash from the complainant and had later counted the money.
