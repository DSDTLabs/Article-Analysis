THRISSUR: The rescue of a   woman who was allegedly detained illegally by her mother in  , is the culmination of a series of legal battles which had begun in 2016. 

 The 20-year-old was staying with her mother at   near Guruvayur and her father had passed away a couple of years ago. A Muslim youth, who hails from the neighbouring area of Koonammoochi and working with a chicken shop, used to be close with the family even when the father was alive. The girl and the boy who had developed an affair insisted on pursuing their earlier plans to get married after the father's death. However, the mother objected to this and she and the daughter relocated to a place close to Cheranellur near to Kochi. 
 
 In between the youth filed a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court in 2016. The   submitted a report on the petition as per the directive of the court. The Supreme Court had then dismissed the petition, according to the Guruvayur C I Balakrishnan.
 
 Meanwhile the mother had filed a petition in the   alleging that the youth was harassing her and her daughter. The mother had submitted that the daughter had undergone treatment for mental ailment at Thrissur and Kochi.
 
 The high court then ordered that the woman must be sent with her mother and directed the Kochi city police commissioner and Cheranellur police to give police protection to them.
 
 Subsequently the family stayed at different places like Mayannur in Thrissur and eventually moved to Mangaluru, the CI said.
