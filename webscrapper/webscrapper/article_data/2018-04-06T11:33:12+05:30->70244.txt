CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president   Singh Badal on Thursday urged the   government not to force the truckers to make heavy reductions in tender rates of contracts to transport wheat.

 He alleged that the Congress leaders were making merry by fleecing ‘palledar’ unions and making them pay steep concessions for award of labour contracts. Sukhbir said that the Congress government was bent on snatching the livelihoods of those who were gainfully employed in the trucking business.
 
 It was shocking that despite start of wheat purchase on April 1, the state government had still not completed the process of awarding tenders for transportation of procured wheat to appropriate godowns, said the SAD president. He added that state government’s such decisions were affecting livelihood of thousands of truckers with more than 70,000 trucks being used for this purpose. He said it would also affect farmers as failure to lift wheat from mandis would clog them and delay the procurement process.
 
 Sukhbir said it was unfortunate that the government was using coercive methods to force the truckers to toe its dictatorial line. “At least 80% of the 70,000 odd trucks used to transport wheat and paddy during the biannual procurement season are self-owned. Moreover the owners don’t ply them otherwise because they are old and cannot be used to long haul carriage,” claimed the former deputy CM.
 
 ‘Govt insulting farmers’
 
 Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal on Thursday attacked the Punjab government for allegedly insulting farmers in the name of a loan waiver when nothing was being done and farm suicides were on the rise. More than 400 farmers had committed suicide in the last one year, they said. SAD leader   said, “The truth is that the Congress government has failed to implement the promised Rs 90,000 crore farmer loans taken from nationalized and cooperative banks as well as private money lenders”.
