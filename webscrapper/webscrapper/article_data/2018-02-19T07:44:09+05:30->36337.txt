HYDERABAD: Among stories of struggle at the 6th  , there were also stories of strength. In one heartening example, a lone mother was there to back her   son. 

 Disappointed at hardly any parents turning up, Mala (53), a Hyderabad-based social worker said, "If we parents don't support our children, then who will? This year, I am the only parent who attended the parade. This day is important for the queer community, it should be for parents also." 
 
 In 2006, when Mala's son Shiva first told her that he is gay, she was confused. "I am important to him, so he told me about his sexuality rather than hiding it. I read about what   was all about, then I realised I would never force him regarding anything," she said. 
 
 "We have started a society 'Uphaar Parents Circle' for LGBTQ parents. I counsel parents, as many consider being LGBTQ a disease. Which it is not," she said.
