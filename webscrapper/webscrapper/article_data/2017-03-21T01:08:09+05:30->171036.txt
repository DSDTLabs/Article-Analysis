NAVI MUMBAI: The city police commissionerate has been slow in implementing a circular, issued by the state government, regarding action to be taken against pillion riders   without strapping on their helmets. 

 The Central government has also increased the   from a paltry Rs 100 to Rs 500 and the fine will be applicable to both the riders.
 
 Although, the police has not implemented the circular properly, the   department carried out a drive, on World Head Injury Awareness Day, at Johnson and Johnson crossing in  , Shivaji Chowk in Vashi, near St Lawrence crossing on   and Vashi Plaza crossing on Sion-Panvel highway. All three, including the two in Vashi, are major traffic junctions.
 
 Fortis hospital in Mulund, which was part of the drive, distributed 50 helmets, while cops booked front-seat riders who had violated the law.
 
 DCP (traffic) Nitin Pawar told TOI, “I wanted to implement the circular and book pillion riders too, but it was felt that we should first instil discipline in front riders and later start imposing penalties on the pillion riders. Also, there’s confusion regarding the legal enforcement of penalty on the pillion rider.’’
 
  A spokesperson of the hospital said, “The logo of the city hospital has been affixed on the helmets distributed. We also gave out helmets as part of awareness drive recently held in Bangalore.’’ 
 
 The police and the hospital have affirmed that injury to the head is the main reason for biker deaths in most of the road accidents.
 
 Fortis Hospital, Mulund, treats about 25 cases of accidents involving two-wheeler riders every month, most of which are head injuries. Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi, also treats similar number of cases every month, most of them bike riders, who have suffered severe head injuries. They are also treated for accident-related trauma.
