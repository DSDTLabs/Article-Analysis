 In court documents, Gordon has said Guzze left a voicemail referencing two huge street gangs, The   and The   -- said Hernandez was a member of both gangs and noting that he was 'keeping them at bay right now'.
 
 Gordon said Guzze threatened physical harm, said , "I don't need to tell you how (the gangs) work... They're right here in LA"
 
 Gordon said the threats continued online.
 
 In the documents filed in a court, Gordon has asked the judge to keep Guzze at least 300 yards from his office and all of his employees. 
 
 Guzze, "Mark Gordon has taken this too far. Aaron Hernandez is a very sensitive story and I've made him aware on multiple occasions that no one is doing this story but the family and the original partners that were closely tied to Aaron and his estate.
 
 "There is more to come, concerning Aaron's story, and by making this a public spectacle, I feel it's just throwing gasoline on the fire."
