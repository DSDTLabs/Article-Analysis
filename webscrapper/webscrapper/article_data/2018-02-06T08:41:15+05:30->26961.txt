GUWAHATI: While the Kamrup (metro) district administration has been carrying out   across the city to spruce it up for the ' ', their efforts are being foiled by miscreants who are stealing and vandalizing the decorations.   have been stolen in some areas, some newly painted roads already show spit marks and even some flower tubs have been stolen. 

 "We want to keep the city clean and decorated, like we had done for the business summit. However, it's not possible for us to do it alone without the support of the public. Unfortunately, miscreants have already done damage by stealing the flower tubs, bamboo designs and spitting on the newly painted roadsides," deputy commissioner M Angamuthu told reporters here on Monday.
 
 Two FIRs have been lodged by the National Highway Authority of India and the Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority regarding stealing of beautification items and removing sign marks from the national highway.
 
 Commissioner of police Hiren Nath said strict action will be taken against those who are found guilty. "We have taken the issue seriously. We are conducting the investigation and strict action will be taken so that no one dares to do such things," said Nath. 
 
 Guwahati Municipal Corporation mayor Mrigen Sarania said the administration and other stakeholders will meet every two months to plan beautification projects in the city and also to preserve the existing projects. "So far, we have done beautification projects in 60 locations in the city, which we will preserve in a systematic manner. To get the culprits nabbed, we need the support of the public. I want all of you to use technology to stop these ill-activities," said Sarania. 
 
 Earlier, the GMC had started an initiative through which residents were requested to click photos and shoot videos if they found people creating public nuisances and upload these to the state government (www.assam.mygov.in) website.
