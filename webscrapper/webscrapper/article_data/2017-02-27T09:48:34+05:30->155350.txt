NAGPUR: “In Concurrent list, both Union and state can interfere while decision making, due to which it needs to include agriculture with education for survival of farmers,” said  , vice-chancellor of   (PDKV) at a lecture on ‘Shetmaal ayat dhoranache shetkaryawar parinaam’ at Jansamwaad programme organized by Janmanch at Shewalkar Hall, Shankar Nagar, on Saturday.

 Nimbalkar discussed the need for subsidy and compensation for crop losses. “We import grains which can be produced by our farmers. As a result, farmers have to face major losses.” 
 
 “China did not have a single dam till 1955 and now they have 22,000. This is why their farmers produce much more compared to ours,” said Nimbalkar and added, “Real development can only happen with growth in agriculture.”
 
 “Bring policies which are ideal for farmers,” said Sharad Patil, adviser of Janmanch. “Japan has 778% tax on rice import and 358% on sugar as they are the leading producer, but India has 0% import tax,” he said and added, “More production creates more money is the basic marketing rule but in the case of Indian farmer more production creates more loss.”
 
  presided over the event. Rajesh Kilor, president of Janmanch, and secretary   were present. Suhas Khandekar compèred the programme.
