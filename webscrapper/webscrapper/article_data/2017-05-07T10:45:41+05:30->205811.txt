 He said that the Congress has no leader whereas the BJP has two strong leaders in Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, both of whom are taking the nation to new strides.

 Hinting that the Centre would not support the Telangana government in getting its Muslim reservation bill passed, Venkaiah said that BJP would oppose reservations promised on the basis of religion. "Hindus and Christians are not getting reservations. How can a particular religion get reservation?" he asked.

Reservations based on religion would have serious negative effects on the society, he warned.
 
 Later, addressing party workers of Secunderabad LS, he said, "Modi has reached every household in the country, but you have to reach every household and explain the schemes of the government." BJP has now spread over 65% of the geographical area of India and would cover the remaining areas by 2019.
