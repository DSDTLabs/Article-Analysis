PUNE: As many as 14,392 students were allotted various colleges across Pune and   in the third round for   (FYJC) under the   (CAP). Students can take admissions in the colleges between July 29 and August 1.

 The third merit list was announced a day in advance on Friday around 5pm on the official admission website. A total of 2,591students have been allotted their first preference in round 1. A whopping 23,437 students have not been allotted any college in the third list.
 
 A total of 35,173 students were eligible for the third round of whom 2,114 applications were new from students for the third round while the rest had been carried forward from the previous rounds.
 
 At the end of the second round, 47,020 students had got admission while 44,650 seats were available for the third round.
 
 “It is advised that students take admission as per their allotments. For students who have been allotted their first preference, there is no choice but to take the admission or be out of the CAP rounds. Students allotted colleges between their second and tenth preference in the application form can decide whether they want to confirm their admissions or wait for the next round,“ Dinkar  , deputy director of Education, Pune division, said.
 
 Temkar said students and parents must not confirm their admissions in the allotted colleges in case they are not sure about the choice. “ Once you take admission and then cancel it, your standard X board roll number gets blocked on the website. This means you are out of the process and can apply in the special round in the last leg after the SSC re-exams are conducted,“ he added.
 
 If parents have not approached the college or if they have not brought the requisite documents, colleges must not upload their admissions on the website, Temkar said.
