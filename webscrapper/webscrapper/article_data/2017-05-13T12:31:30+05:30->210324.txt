A warning letter from Sundar Shaekhar, who claims that he is an adopted son of the don, has asked superstar   not to depict   as a 'smuggler and an underworld don' in the movie. Despite director   denying that the film is about Haji Mastan,   has sent notice to Rajnikanth.

 Part of the notice read, "I further state that you are depicting my Godfather and a well known national political leader as a “Smuggler and an Underworld Don”, which are highly unacceptable and I strongly oppose such misinterpretation of my Godfather.”
  
 It was also mentioned, "If you are really interested in making film on the lifestyle of Late Shri Haji Mastan Mirza then I shall provide you his real life story..."
 
 Haji Mastan was a people's leader, but more like a don, and lived between 1926 and 1994. He was a was n Indian smuggler, films financer and real estate businessman. He was fluent in Tamil, lived in Mumbai and was known for his unique traits of dressing completely in white clothes, wearing white shoes, smoking costly cigarrettes and driving a white mercedes made him a "style icon" among the poor. It is to be noted that Ajay Devgn's role in the 2010 Bollywood film Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai was also based on Haji Mastan.
