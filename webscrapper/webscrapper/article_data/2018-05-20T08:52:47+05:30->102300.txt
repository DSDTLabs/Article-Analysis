MYSURU: Despite several incidents of wild animals attacking tourists and the general rule of not taking pictures or stopping vehicles inside forest areas, many tourists are violating the rules. 

 Taking note of this the forest department is now mulling over implementing the rule in a strict manner and imposing a penalty of Rs 1,000 on those found violating the rule.
 
  Though the forest department is creating awareness among tourists not to alight from vehicles during safari, some tourists lure forest personnel and get down from the vehicles to take pictures, said sources. The forest authorities, instead of cracking the whip, are mute spectators. It is a common phenomenon in  , they added. 
 
 Jagat Ram, additional principal chief conservator of forests, told STOI: "It is true that people are getting down from safari vehicles, which is against the Wildlife Act. It has become difficult to control them. But in days to come we will come out with strict guidelines and those found violating the law will be penalized and stringent action will be taken even against forest personnel who are found encouraging tourists to take photographs."
 
 "We will impose a   of Rs 1,000 on those getting down from safari vehicles. Jungle Lodges staff must also see to it that those who go on safari do not get down from vehicles," he added.
