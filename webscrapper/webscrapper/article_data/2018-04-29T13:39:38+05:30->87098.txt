They say skill and confidence are an unconquered army and at   Kerala 2018, which has just kicked off in Kochi, this definitely seems to be the mantra. 

 An initiative of Kerala Academy for Skills (KASE) kicked off at Marine Drive, the initiative gives youngsters a chance to test their skills in 20 trades, and there will also be prizes for those who walk away with the titles for the best. The winners who represent the state in ‘IndiaSkills 2018’ will qualify for the national level ‘WorldSkills 2019’ as well, which will be soon held at the city of Kazan, Russia.
