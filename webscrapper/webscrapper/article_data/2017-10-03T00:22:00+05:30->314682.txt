Patiala: The Nabha police have booked a man, his son and relatives for   a 27-year-old woman, who was having a live-in relationship with a man for over a month after permission from the high court. As the woman was unhappy with her Ludhiana-based husband, she left him and started living with the man at Alipur village in Patiala district.

 The victim’s family members, including her father Mehar Chand, her brother Darshan Singh, her father’s brother Sucha Ram, a councillor from Dhuri Sadhu Singh and others were booked after they allegedly kidnapped the victim from Alipur village on Sunday.
 
 “The victim was living with Om Prakash at Alipur village. She had taken permission from the Punjab and Haryana high court for this. The court had mentioned that being an adult she could stay with anyone she wanted to. The accused allegedly took the victim forcibly in a car. A complaint was registered by the sister-in-law of Om Prakash, following which a complaint was registered under various sections of kidnapping, assault, rioting and criminal conspiracy against seven identified and eight unidentified people. The girl managed to escape and reached the police station on her own. Her statement will be recorded on Tuesday before court,” Mohan Singh, IO, said.
 
 Police revealed that the victim, a resident of Dhuri, was married off to a person three years back in Ludhiana. She left her following alleged torture and started living with Om Prakash at Alipur village. The latter is father of three while his wife had died long back.
