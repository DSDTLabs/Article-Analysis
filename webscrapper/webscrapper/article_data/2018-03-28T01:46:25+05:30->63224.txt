Behrampore: Uma Soren, India’s first woman MP from the   community, addressed the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference in Geneva on Tuesday on the issues facing India’s tribals even 70 years after Independence.

 Soren’s hour-long speech before representatives from 178 countries comes amid apprehensions of a clash among enlisted and unenlisted aboriginal tribal communities in four districts of West Bengal’s Jangalmahal — Jhargram, Purulia, West Midnapore and Bankura. Recently, Adivasi Kurmi Samaj launched movements such as ‘Dahar Chhanka’ (road blockade) and ‘Jigir Jita Gobchan’ (indefinite sit-in) demanding inclusion of Kurmis in the list of Scheduled Tribes.
 
 In her 24-page speech, Soren highlighted how Santhals were not even a listed ST in states such as Assam and were hence deprived of all government benefits that come with such recognition. She told the conference that most tribal communities in India had not developed according to expectations.
 
 Moreover, she said, most primitive cultures were decaying in modern society. She added that the condition of aboriginal communities such as Kurmis and Deswalis had worsened as they had been removed from the ST list for unknown reasons. She also said tribal cultures were more enriched than any other culture.
 
 Kurmi Development and Cultural Board executive member Rameswar Mahato, also Purbanchal Adivasi Kurmi Samaj general secretary, said: “Our MP reflected the true picture of India’s tribal community in Geneva.”
