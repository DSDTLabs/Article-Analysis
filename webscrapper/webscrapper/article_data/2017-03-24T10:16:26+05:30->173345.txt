AHMEDABAD: This is the perfect example of   at play, where a group of citizens that has been gassed by thick toxic smoke 500m from the   site for 22 years, has now been told to vacate their homes.

 What the   ( ) fails to understand is that the toxic smoke affects those living even 3km away, and does not dissipate in 500m.
 
  Methods like scientific landfill capping, bio-mining and waste to energy have existed for 15 years. AMC’s own records shows project proposals presented at Vibrant Gujarat of 2003. For some strange reason, such projects never took off for more than 15 years, exposing citizens to toxic smoke.
 
 “The Pirana smoke has damaged the health of lakhs, not just those living within 500m of the site. For most poor families here, the health costs have been a burden. If the AMC caps this site, it will be because these poor people — who are to be evicted shortly — courageously approached the high court for the benefit of the entire city. They should not be punished for this,” says petitioner Kaleem Siddiqui. 
 
 The Pirana site forms part of a ‘toxic doughnut’ for the people in the area, with the the dump site fire smoke, emissions from surrounding industries and the oily effluent pumped into the Sabarmati river 500m from the dump site.
