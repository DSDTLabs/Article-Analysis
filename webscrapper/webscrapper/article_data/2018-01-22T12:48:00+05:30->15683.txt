 Speaking to mediapersons at the Press Club here on Sunday, Nandeesh, who spoke on behalf of the aggrieved students of KSOU said, “Keeping students’ interest in mind, both the central and state governments should have come together and solved the KSOU issue which is pending since the past three years. But it is unfortunate that both these government have not bothered to look into the issue putting the life of about three lakh students into jeopardy. If both the governments defer the issue further we will teach them a lesson in the forthcoming assembly elections.”
 
 The students said they will stage a protest during the Parivarthana Rally in where BJP’s national president Amith Shah and senior   leaders are expected to take part. “Apart from this, we are also going stage protest during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bengaluru on February 5,” they said.
 
 “Even after High Court order, the University Grants Commission failed to recognize KSOU. The state and the central governments are politicizing the issue, instead of directing the UGC to follow the court orders,” the students alleged.
