LUCKNOW: Transferring a   in your name to another person has become easier now as there are more options than before.

 Railways has tweaked the policy under which a reserved railway ticket can be transferred. While earlier only blood relatives were allowed to travel in place of the original ticket holder, now, friends, colleagues and business partners can also do so.
 
 According to officials of   (NR) and   (NER), hundreds of complaints were lodged by passengers against the  .
 
 There were also complaints that touts were misusing the policy which allowed ticket transfer 24 hours prior to the departure of the train.
 
 Now, tickets can also be transferred between students of the same educational institution or hostel. Similarly, colleagues can also transfer their ticket to each other with proof of being in the same organisation. However, the application for transfer will have to be submitted 48 hours prior to the train’s departure.
 
 The written application will have to be submitted to the chief reservation supervisor (CRS) or to the station manager—the two officers authorized to approve the application.
 
 For transfer to relatives, a copy of the relationship proof will need to be submitted.
 
 If the transfer request is made by a student, a written application is required from the head of the recognized institution. The same applies to colleagues also.
