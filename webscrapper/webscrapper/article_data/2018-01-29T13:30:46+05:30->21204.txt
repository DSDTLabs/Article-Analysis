 "We were creating an aspirational world where the African people are in charge of their own destiny. And that really appealed to me and had the little girl inside me jumping for joy," Nyong'o told. "To just have African people, black people, at the center of that narrative is so exciting."

We were always told, 'You need to make a difference in the world,'" Nyong'o said. "I live with that insistence all the time," she added.
