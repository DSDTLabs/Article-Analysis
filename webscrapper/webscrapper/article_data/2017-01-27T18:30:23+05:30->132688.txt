Please provide the above information within seven days of receipt of this notice failing which appropriate action shall be initiated as per law.”
 
 The principal of the college could not be contacted. Chairperson of the campus of open learning C S Dubey said that the college has always been very helpful to the SOL as well as to the non-collegiate students. “In fact, the principal has gone out of the way to conduct special programmes for these students. Yes, the number of   turning up at  , Hans Raj College or Arts Faculty is significantly higher than other centres, but that is because of the good faculty and facility. Therefore, at times there may be space crunch.”
 
 The memorandum submitted to DCW was demanding a written apology from the college and it also alleged that the college authorities forcibly take away the identity cards of students who wanted to enter the college and those who refused were being turned away.
