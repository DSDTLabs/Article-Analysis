BENGALURU: Depressed after her lover-colleague refused to marry her, a 25-year-old nurse at a private hospital committed suicide in her hospital accommodation in Nagarbhavi, west Bengaluru on Monday morning.

 In a five-minute   recorded on her mobile, R Nishkala, who was from   in Chamarajanagar, said how she was depressed after her lover, Gangadhar, refused to marry her because his family would not the accept the inter-caste marriage. She was found hanging from the ceiling by her colleagues.
 
 
 Nishkala had been a staff nurse at the hospital for the past year, police said. Gangadhar, who had earlier promised to marry Nishkala, distanced himself from her last December, family sources said.
 
 Nishkala’s younger brother Rakesh told police she had told him that Gangadhar was avoiding her. “Two days ago, I met Gangadhar and tried to convince him. He refused, saying his family would not accept my sister,” Rakesh told police. Based on statements by family members,   police booked a case of abetment to suicide against Gangadhar and are searching for him.
