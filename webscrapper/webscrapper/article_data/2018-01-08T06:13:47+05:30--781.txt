KOLKATA: A Jharkhand-based businessman was found hanging inside the room of a hotel on   on Sunday morning. Police found two notes kept on a table inside the room. 

 In one note, he had written that nobody was responsible for his death. Five Rs-2,000 notes were found wrapped in another sheet where he had written that the money was for the hotel management and would take care of the room tariff and other expenses.
 
 According to police, Vinod Khullar (35), a resident of Bistupur,  , checked into the hotel on Saturday. While the hotel management did not notice anything suspicious on Saturday, they found his room bolted from inside since Sunday morning. While the hotel staff kept on knocking his door, he did not respond. When police were informed, they rushed to the spot and broke open the door. The body of the man was found hanging from the ceiling.
 
 Sources said Khullar's business had been doing well initially, but he started making loss in the past few years. He was depressed with the performance of the family-run business. He came to Kolkata on a business trip and he checked into the hotel around 6pm on Saturday. While he had dinner on Saturday, nobody suspected anything unusual in his behaviour. 
 
  contacted Bistupur police station and got in touch with his family members. "It is learnt that he was suffering from depression due to business related problems. An unnatural death case has been started," said an officer of Kolkata Police.
