Coimbatore: A gang of five stole a truck laden with new tyres near a toll plaza in Dharmapuri on Sunday early morning after threatening the driver, who parked the vehicle on a service road for a quick nap, at knifepoint. The value of the consignment is roughly estimated at Rs 10 lakh.

 According to police, the truck was heading to Gujarat from Kerala. “The driver, identified as R Jian Singh, 42, of Pratapgarh district in Uttar Pradesh, loaded the tyres from Apollo Tyres Limited at Chalakudi in Kerala on Saturday early morning to be supplied to a private firm in Gujarat. On Sunday around 4am, he reached a toll plaza in Dharmapuri. He stopped the truck on a service road located 500m away from the toll plaza as he was drowsy,” they said.
 
 As he fell asleep, a five-member gang reached the spot in a car around 5am and two of them got inside the truck. They woke up the driver, threatened him at knifepoint and asked him to handover the truck keys to them. When he refused, they stabbed him in his hand, tied hands and legs, and gagged him. The gang then shifted him to the car and one of the gang members drove away the truck, the police said.
 
 When they reached near Pennagaram town in Dharmapuri, the gang members pushed down the truck driver from the car after robbing him of 2,500 and a mobile phone. Motorists on the route rescued him and alerted the Dharmapuri town police, who took him to government hospital.
 
 The Dharmapuri police, meanwhile, alerted the Krishnagiri police, who conducted vehicle checks to trace the truck. They later came to know that the truck had crossed a toll plaza in Krishnagiri at 7.15am.
 
 Based on the truck driver’s complaint, Thoppur police inspector B Jaishankar has registered a case under Sections 395 (punishment for dacoity) and 397 (robbery or dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code. Further investigation is on.
