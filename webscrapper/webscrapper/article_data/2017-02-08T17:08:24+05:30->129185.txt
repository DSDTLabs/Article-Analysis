Aamir Khan’s ‘Dangal’ made box-office history as it crossed the Rs 375-crore mark on Friday. However, the film seems to be in no mood to slow down at the ticket windows. The Nitesh Tiwari-directed movie saw a rise of 76.47 per cent in its business on Saturday as it collected Rs 2.10 crore, against its Rs 1.19 crore collections on Friday. The film’s total collection now reads a staggering Rs 378.24 crore in the domestic market. It’s impressive that ‘Dangal’, which is in its fifth week, has held its ground despite new releases like ‘OK Jaanu’, ‘xXx: Return Of Xander Cage’ and others.

 
 
 ‘Dangal’, which tells the story of Indian wrestler and coach Mahavir Singh Phogat and how he trained his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari to become world-class wrestlers, holds the distinction of being the highest grossing film in Hindi cinema. The film also features Fatima Sana Shaikh, Sakshi Tanwar and Sanya Malhotra in pivotal roles.
