NAVI MUMBAI: The husband and brother of API  , who has been allegedly murdered, expressed dissatisfaction over the probe into the case. Alleging that Navi Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale was favouring the accused, they warned that if they were harmed, chief minister   should be held responsible 

 Anand, her brother, said, "Our prime demands have not been fulfilled for six months despite meeting Fadnavis and the DGP. We had demanded a fast track court and appointment of Ujjwal Nikam as public prosecutor. ACP   must also continue the probe till its conclusion as she wisely investigated it and submitted detailed technical evidence."
 
 Raju, her husband, said, "As one of the accused, Rajesh Patil, is a nephew of   leader Eknath Khadse, and the other key accused, Abhay Kurundkar, is a police officer and politically influential, they are been favoured by Nagrale. Nagrale has never communicated with the media about the probe even though a woman officer was murdered. Neither police nor government officials have visited the victim's family to express support."
