MUMBAI:  , the leading personality in Indian racing, finally came to the rescue of Sunday's races at the Mahalaxmi Racecourse when he managed to convince Western India Trainers' Association (WITA) to saddle their horses for the big day which will see running of the most prestigious juvenile race in the country , the Poonawalla Breeders' Multi-Million.

 On Friday , WITA had threatened not to saddle horses for Sunday's races over the contentious issue of management of the Benevolent Fund which the   (RWITC) had kept lingering for almost two years. "Poonawalla has promised us to help in sorting out the issue with RWITC. He has always kept his word and we have full faith in his promise," Ivor Fernandes, spokesperson of WITA, told TOI on Saturday .
 
 Meanwhile, Wednesday's races, which were cancelled after WITA members did not submit their entries, has been restored back. RWITC has agreed to the condition of WITA to meet its representatives two hours before the first race on Wednesday to sort out the Benevolent Fund issue. So now races will be held as scheduled on March 1.
