NOIDA: With the focus having quickly shifted from illegal abattoirs to mutton-chicken meat shops, many registered meat shopowners here have lost their jobs along with those running their shops without a licence.

 The shifting of the goalposts has particularly affected mutton-chicken shopowners in cities like Noida and Ghaziabad, where there are a large number of mutton-chicken shops and relatively fewer abattoirs. The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has said that those shops which are registered with the state government have to be checked for violations of food department norms.
 
 Akhtar Qureshi, a chicken-mutton seller in Harijan Basti, Sector 37, said he a licence from the state food department that was issued in 2015 and is valid till 2020. “However, on Friday, when policemen reached the spot, they shut down my shop along with all other shops in the area,” Qureshi said.
 
 A few meat sellers operating from rented shops in Sadarpur village, Sector 46, too have been directed not to slaughter chicken/goat at the shop and they are now bringing slaughtered meat from Ghazipur mandi.
 
 When contacted, Mahendra Srivastava, designated officer for Gautam Budh Nagar FSDA, said there were not more than 20 such fish sellers who have a registration certificate. 
 
 When pointed out that earlier, there was no enforcement of these rules, he said these shops would not be allowed to function if they did not follow the norms now.
 
 DM N P Singh said the certificates would have be “evaluated” now.
