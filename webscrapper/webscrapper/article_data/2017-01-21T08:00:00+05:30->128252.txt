Ghaziabad: The town vending committees (TVCs) in Ghaziabad city, which came into being under the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, have utterly failed to serve their purpose, a survey has found.

 The survey, conducted on street vendors by a team of five BTech students of  , has also exposed the constant struggles being faced by these small-scale businessmen. As many as 40 vendors were surveyed in the   and   areas of Ghaziabad from December 21 to 30.
 
 The major causes for concern for the vendors that were revealed by the survey report were exploitation and low earnings. The study was conducted under the aegis of “Rashtriya Sainik Sansthan”, an NGO of civilians and ex-servicemen, and was part of the students’ PESR (Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility), which in turn was part of their curriculum. It revealed that competition for higher income and a perennial struggle to get closer to passersby and commuters on the road forces them to inch towards the middle of the road as the day progresses. This gradual convergence of the vendors also contributes to traffic congestion. One of the main objectives of the TVC was to locate all the vendors, provide them with identity proofs, and allot them spaces to help them run their businesses smoothly. Nearly 95% of the vendors were clueless about the existence of TVCs, according to the team members. 
 
 The draft of the survey report has been forwarded to Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation and to the district magistrate’s office.
