NAGPUR: Guardian minister Chandrashekar   has directed the   to suspend one of its top officials — director (HR & PR) KMP Singh — and the NMC to stop increment to its five executive engineers for the water crisis and contaminated water supply in some parts of the city. 

 He expressed surprise that this continues to happen even though several crores are spent on infrastructure development and the city has excess raw drinking water available.
 
 At the meeting held by Bawankule with the officials of NMC and OCW on Monday, mayor  , municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar, BJP MLAs Vikas Kumbhare, Sudhakar Kohle, Sudhakar Deshmukh and Dr Milind   and some corporators were present.
 
 Mane told TOI that all the legislators complained about “the failure of NMC and OCW in ensuring proper and potable water supply”. “There is no proper management of water supply. Services have deteriorated instead of improving since OCW has been roped in. NMC officials are sitting pretty leaving everything on OCW,” he said.
 
 Mane added Bawankule was upset when Singh did not give information that was sought. “An irked Bawankule then asked him to leave the meeting. Bawankule spoke to OCW founder Arun Lakhani asking him to suspend Singh. He also directed Hardikar to take action against the executive engineers,” he said.
 
 Chairman of Satranjipura zone Sanjay Chaware brought two bottles of contaminated water to the meeting. Kumbhare said many areas in Central Nagpur was facing water shortage and contaminated water supply. 
 
 “A couple of corporators spoke about water pipelines and valves that were submerged in sewage water. OCW is only making profits and not interested in providing service,” said Chaware.
 
 Legislators also said Bawankule even warned Hardikar of action if services are not improved by the end of April.
 
 Recently, TOI had reported about contaminated water supply in   slums and a part of Mecosabagh Christian Colony.
