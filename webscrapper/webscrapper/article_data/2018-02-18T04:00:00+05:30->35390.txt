Ahmedabad: Anand Gavit and his wife Hetal, a member of village panchayat of Waghmal — which has a population of 4,500 — are anxiously waiting in queue for their pots to be filled up with water at the common tap in the village. The village is some 20km off Waghai town in Dang district.

 "We get six to eight pots filled; that is all for drinking and cooking for three to four days," said Hetal Gavit.
 
 Anand Gavit said, "Currently we get water supply twice a week but after Holi it would be once a week. This supply goes to five villages under Bhendmal group water supply scheme of the state government."
 
 Waghmal is situated in hilly terrain where 90% of check dams are already dry and so are the village wells. For nearly 35,000 people of 40-odd villages, the only source of water is this government water supply scheme. "Cattle need to be taken for grazing and drinking water some 5km away," Anand Gavit said.
 
 Although, most of South Gujarat is relatively better off than other parts of the state, the water situation is already grim in at least 50 villages of northern parts of tribal district of Dang and adjoining Vasda taluka of Navsari district.
 
 Jayant Thorat, the newly elected sarpanch of 5,000-strong Vangan village of Vasda, said that women have started asking him for water. Nearly 30-40 villages including Vangan, Raypore, Mankuniya, Choravani, Nirpan, Mora Amba, Ambabari, Navtad, and Khambhla — located on the border of Maharashtra — have 24x7 electricity, telephone lines, good roads…but no water.
 
 "We have to spend at least Rs 2,500 per month for drinking water for cattle as dairy cooperative is our main source of income," said Suresh Gavit.
