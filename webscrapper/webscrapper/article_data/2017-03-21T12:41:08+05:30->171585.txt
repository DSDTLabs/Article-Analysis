Known to be one of the biggest names in the music industry,   recently admitted that although he wants to get married, he is slightly wary about tying the knot. Speaking to a daily, the talented   said, “Someone please get me married or I’ll jump into a well and kill myself! I was in the recording studio with him A R   recently for three days and he pestered me to get married.”
The 45-year-old singer also said, “My friends send me jokes about how couples suffer after  . Once, a friend sent me a photo of a woman walking and her husband behind her, holding all the shopping bags. These things scare me. But I hope to find a suitable girl soon, one that I’ll pamper a lot. I want it to be a fantabulous relationship. I don’t want her to follow the old traditions or think that my husband is bigger than me or anything like that.”
