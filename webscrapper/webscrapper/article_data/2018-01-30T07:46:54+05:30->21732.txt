CHANDIGARH: In a first-ever address by Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator in the Chandigarh municipal corporation ( ) house in its history of 24 years, V P   on Monday asked the cash-strapped civic body to look for revenue generation resources.

 Badnore said, “In the recent years, the MC has taken various steps in generating more revenue to make the corporation self-reliant. But they are not enough. If proposals regarding revenue generation passed by this house come to my office, we will clear them immediately. Recently, I decided to allot two sites of petrol pumps to be run by the municipal corporation.”
 
 The statement is being seen as a clear indication to the civic body, which is eagerly looking for financial assistance from the UT, to start generating own revenue resources.
 
 The MC has been considering to prepare its budget estimates and send them to the UT administration by next month for approval. Since the civic body has been passing through its worst-ever financial crisis and breaking its FDs (fixed deposits) to run the authority, sources said if the situation continued, it would not be able to even pay salaries to employees.
 
 “No doubt, the MC has started some measures like sending notices to commercial and residential tax evaders and enhancing parking charges, but the amount is too meagre to run the authority. The house did not agree to enhancement of water tariff. We need a huge amount to run the show,” said a senior MC official.
 
 Senior Congress leader and former mayor  , who was present in the house, said, “We were hopeful the administrator would announce some financial package to the MC by assessing its poor financial situation. But we were left disappointed. The recommendations of the 4th Delhi   to give 30% of revenue share of the UT administration to the MC to deal with the financial crisis needs to be implemented as soon as possible.”
