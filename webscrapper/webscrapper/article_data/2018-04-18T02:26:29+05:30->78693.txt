Chennai: The 48-day   in the Tamil film industry has been finally called off and film shootings will resume from Wednesday. The release of new Tamil  , which were barred from March 1, will be streamlined and a schedule will be announced on Wednesday, after a meeting among Tamil producers.

 It took the intervention of Tamil Nadu government, which had convened a tripartite meeting at the state secretariat on Tuesday morning, to resolve the issues involving the Tamil Film Producers’ Council (TFPC), exhibitors and digital service providers. “All issues were discussed and resolved amicably and agreed upon by all sides in the meeting that lasted the whole day,” state information and publicity minister Kadambur C Raju told reporters on Tuesday evening. State commercial taxes minister M C Sampath too participated in the discussions.
 
 “The schedule for release of new films will be discussed and announced in a day or two, after a meeting of our council. Tickets can be priced flexibly depending on big budget or small films,” said Vishal, president, TFPC. With new releases to be streamlined as per date of censor certification, it could prove a hard task for TFPC, especially with a backlog of around 40 small films and with big films like Rajinikanth’s ‘Kaala’ eyeing an early summer harvest.
 
 “As for digital service providers, it has been decided that the system used in the other southern states will apply for Tamil Nadu also. The theatres will not pay the virtual print fee (VPF) and the MRP for tickets has been fixed at Rs 150, with the theatres free to charge lower rates for certain films as they decide,” Tiruppur K Subramaniam, joint president, joint action committee formed by Tamil Nadu theatre owners, told TOI.
