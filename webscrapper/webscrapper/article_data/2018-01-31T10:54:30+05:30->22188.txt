CHENNAI: Two months after a couple of medical students from a   died in a road accident due to drunken driving, the state medical university is set to start a campaign that will encourage medicos to abstain from alcohol, at least before they hit the road.

 The Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University has written to the deans and vice-principals of 23 state-run medical colleges and all the private colleges affiliated to the varsity asking them to initiate programmes that will help doctors lead a healthy, stress-free lifestyle, including counselling against drunken driving. 
 
 “Our informal surveys show that many medical students begin drinking on campus by the end of the first year or at the beginning of the second year. Having mentors will also help them destress because these mentors can guide and counsel students. It will also help them become better doctors,” said university registrar  .
 
 Last week, the university had asked colleges to have one mentor for a batch of 20 students each. Officials say these mentors will also be teaching students ethical work practices. “We must tell our doctors and medical students to be role models,” said   dean Dr Jayanthi. 
 
 In the next two months, at least three core committees appointed by the university vice-chancellor Dr   will discuss the required amendments in the medical curriculum that will include financial economics and laws relating to the medical profession besides changes in teaching methods. The discussions will have to be accepted and passed by the standing academic board before any changes are made. 
 
 “While some ethical lessons can be included in the syllabus, many will have to come through observation from seniors. The   in each college aims to provide this,” said Dr Balasubramanian.
