Well-known   actress   was recently molested by a drunk man at a Mumbai movie hall. When we spoke to the actor about this, she said, “I was watching the movie along with my daughter  , when a man started staring at me who was seated next to me. Initially, I thought he was trying to recognise me because I’m a celebrity but soon he extended his hand and touched me. I immediately stood up and thrashed him black and blue. He tried to escape but thankfully the security guards caught hold of him.”

 She goes on to add, “My daughter was stunned to see my reaction but it was important to take a firm step and teach him a lesson. If I had kept mum, he would have gone and molested someone else. There was no reason for me to keep quiet at that moment. In fact, I have filed a police complaint at Mira Road police station. ”
 
 After this brave act, actress now wants to take this fight to the next level in order to put a full stop to the molestation incidents. “I have a problem with such perverts. How can someone even think of doing such things? My daughter also travels by train, I’m scared about her security now. And why should girls learn to defend themselves, why can’t boys be taught how to behave with girls? I’ll be starting a campaign against molesters soon to teach a lesson to these perverts,” says she.
