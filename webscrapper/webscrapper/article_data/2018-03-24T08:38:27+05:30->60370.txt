AHMEDABAD: If all goes smoothly, citizens will see women cops patrolling city roads on motorcycles and squads of men and women personnel keeping eyes on crowded places such as the markets such at Teen Darwaja and Kalupur. These teams have been named ‘She Squads.’

 A coordination meeting between city police and the   State   took place on Friday at the city police headquarters, where commissioner A K   and officers participated. Some issues discussed included gathering inputs on woman-related issues and focusing on redress mechanisms.
 
 “A few plans chalked out included the formation of ‘She Squads’ consisting of teams of women and men, who will patrol sensitive areas. There are also plans to include women personnel in PCR vans, which are the first responders at crime scenes. Finally on pilot basis, we will train some women personnel to be part police stations’ Hawk Squads, which patrol areas on motorcycles,” said K L N Rao, special commissioner of police, Sector I.
 
 City police officials said the major crimes where women are victims are chain snatching in the western parts and police impersonators, who target senior citizens.
