A year after announcing their breakup,   and his ex-girlfriend   were recently spotted together at a coffee shop in Mumbai, reports Mumbai Mirror.
 
  Ankita and Sushant had first met on the sets of Zee TV's show ' ', fell in love and started living together. The two were slated to get married in 2016 but unfortunately broke up.
  
  They had one of the most public breakups but seems like the duo wants to make amends post all the acrimony.
  
  
 
  
  The former lovers, who were in a relationship for over 6 years, were spotted sipping on coffee at a local restaurant in Lokhandwala, Andheri, where they formerly resided together.
  
  A source reported that the estranged lovers didn't engage in any long conversations or chit-chat, but rather sat in comfortable silence. Perhaps their silence was building bridges or assuaging the pain. This news will surely come as a delight to fans wishing that the estranged couple rekindles their romance.
  
  While Sushant seems to have moved on from his heartbreak and is busy shooting for his next flick ‘Raabta’ with Kriti Sanon, Ankita, on the other hand, seems to still be holding on to their love.
