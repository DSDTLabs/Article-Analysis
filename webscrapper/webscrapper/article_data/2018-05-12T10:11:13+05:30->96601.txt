KOCHI: With the hop-on, hopoff tours failing to take off as expected,   is banking their hopes on the package tours they plan to formally launch. The package tours run on a trial basis for the past three months has evoked good response from the public.

 “The package, which includes a full-day tour of   heritage spots and museums, can be availed by families and large groups. The package also includes welcome drinks and lunch from the restaurants recently opened at the boat jetties,” said   PM, managing director,   Ltd.
 
 
 “A variety of groups, such as senior citizens, college students and families have availed the service so far. Many residents’ associations have also evinced interest in it. A turnover to the tune of Rs 6-7 lakh rupees was registered from the tour package alone last month,” Nowshad said.
 
 Unlike the hop-on, hop-off service, the packaged tours can be customized and would be suitable for groups.
 
 “It can be designed according to the convenience of the group and allows early or late commencement of the trip. Tourists can also decide on the time they spend on a point,” Nowshad said.
 
 However, the service will not be discontinued, and will be available according to the demand, he added.
 
 Aqualified guide, specially trained by the Muziris Projects team for four months exclusively on the history of Muziris and related museums, will accompany the group for the one-day tour.
