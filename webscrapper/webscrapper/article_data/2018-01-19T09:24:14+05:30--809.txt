AMARAVATI: Making a startling revelation,   vice-chairman   said people of   contribute 50 per cent tax revenue to  . AP chief minister Chandrababu Naidu was often quoted as saying that Andhra people had played a big part in the development of Hyderabad and Telangana.

 Speaking at the inaugural of the two-day collectors' conference on Thursday, Rajiv Kumar said Andhra people living in Hyderabad are the biggest contributors to Telangana's tax revenue. He said AP has thus lost out on income generated from Hyderabad. On the brighter side, he said AP would prosper better than any other state if Andhra people return from Hyderabad and make Amaravati their home. "This, in turn, will make AP extend financial support to other states," he said.
 
 Kumar reiterated that the government should compete with the private sector to create assets and extend quality service to the people. He complimented the efforts of Naidu and affirmed that AP would see greater development under the guidance of Naidu.
