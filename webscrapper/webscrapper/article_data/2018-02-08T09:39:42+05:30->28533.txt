BHUBANESWAR: The   on Wednesday demanded an unconditional apology from chief minister   for allegedly allowing party workers to assault the woman who had reportedly hurled eggs at his dais at a public meeting in   district on January 31. 

 Party veteran  , while addressing media persons here, lashed out at the state government for not arresting the attackers of the woman, Rajashree Kamila alias Mita, following the egg hurling episode. The woman had thrown eggs at the CM's dais demanding justice for the Kunduli victim. 
 
 "The eggs did not even touch Naveen, but party workers assaulted Mita in the presence of police. The chief minister kept quiet when his party workers were misbehaving with Mita," Harichandan added.
 
 Harichandan said police slapped attempt-to-murder charges on the woman for throwing three eggs on Naveen. 
 
 "The chief minister always claims that his government respects women. But the egg hurling incident exposed his government's mindset towards them. He should beg an unconditional apology before the women of the state," he added. 
 
 BJP leaders said the woman is undergoing treatment at the SCB Medical College and Hospital.
 
  "Fearing a backlash, the police removed the attempt-to-murder charge. Will the police slap any criminal charges against the chief minister now? The law is not taking its own course in the state," said the former law minister.
 
 Biju   spokesperson Samir Das said an investigation into the matter is afoot.
 
  "BJD workers did not assault the woman. Police present over there immediately swung into action and protected her. The BJP is raising the issue to get political mileage. The court will decide who committed the crime," he added.
