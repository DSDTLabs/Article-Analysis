AHMEDABAD: In a setback for the owners of  , which is accused of cheating investors of   (NSEL) out of Rs 969 crore, Gujarat high court on Wednesday refused to intervene on petitions filed by its owners.

 As multiple litigations are pending before courts in Mumbai on this issue, the HC thought it fit to shift the proceedings before the special court in Mumbai, said Arjun Sheth, a lawyer involved in the litigation.
 
 While refusing to intervene, the HC lifted the stay on attachment of properties. However, three weeks’ time has been granted to the company to move the Supreme Court.
 
 The owners of the company moved the HC against the Maharashtra government’s order to the Gujarat revenue authorities to secure properties in Ahmedabad, Mehsana and Patan districts, to recover money to pay back the investors. The properties have been listed and the owners have been barred from selling them. The Maharashtra government also took measures against 24 other defaulters with NSEL, an online platform for trading in agricultural commodities, and got properties in various states attached in the interest of the investors. The total default by various companies has been pegged at Rs 5,600 crore.
