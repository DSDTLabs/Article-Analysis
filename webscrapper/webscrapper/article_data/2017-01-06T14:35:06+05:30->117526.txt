 In addition to this, the age of the candidate will also be a deciding factor, he said. Sampla also said that he will also consider giving tickets to new faces as well. This statement from the Union minister especially mentions that “age factor” has clearly dashed the hopes of those “aged” incumbents who are in the foray for tickets.
 
 As per sources, chances of ex-health minister and senior leader Satpal Gosain getting a ticket from Ludhiana Central are over and as a result, the fight on this seat is left only between other ticket seekers that include chairman of Ludhiana Improvement trust, Dr Subash Verma and Gurdev Sharma Debi.
