PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday unveiled a refurbished equestrian statue of Veer Kunwar Singh at the   here as part of the three-day-long   celebrations.

 The bronze statue, which earlier stood at the R-Block roundabout, shows Singh riding on a horse, holding its reins in one hand and brandishing a sword in another hand. The statue was recently shifted to the park because it had come beneath a flyover under construction near the R-Block roundabout. The 102-year-old park, earlier known as Hardinge Park, has also been renamed after Kunwar Singh. The original statue at the R-Block roundabout was inaugurated in the 90s by the then CM Lalu Prasad.
 
 Nitish, his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi, road construction minister Nand Kishor Yadav, PHED minister Vinod Narayan Jha, MLA Shyam Rajak and MLC Sanjay Kumar Singh alias   paid rich tributes to the great warrior by garlanding his equestrian statue.
 
 The CM also inaugurated terracotta murals based on the life and works of Kunwar Singh at the same park. He asked the Patna district officials to make wall paintings based on life of Kunwar Singh on all other walls of the park, so that visitors can get maximum information about the warrior. He also asked the officials to ensure plantation of more trees in the sprawling park.
 
 Earlier, a group of schoolchildren welcomed the CM by offering roses when he reached the park. Artists from information and public relations department presented patriotic songs on the occasion.
 
 State chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh, Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor, secretaries to the CM Atish Chandra and   and Patna DM Kumar Ravi also were present. 
 
 Later in the evening, a laser show based on the life of Kunwar Singh was also opened at the park. A cultural programme was organized at Shri Krishna Memorial Hall where prominent folk artists regaled the audience. The cultural programmes will be held on all three days of the Vijayotsav which will conclude on April 25.
