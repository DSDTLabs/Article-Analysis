 Coming agonisingly close to a bronze medal in her first appearance at the   was 23-year-old  , whose total score of 86 was one short of the bronze winner, Linda Pearson of Scotland.
 
 
 
 At the Belmont Shooting Centre on day seven of competition at  , Shreyasi dominated the very strong 10-member field to earn her second double trap medal after she won silver in the same event four years in Glasgow CWG. In her third trip to the quadrennial Games, the 26-year-old shot rounds of 24, 25, 22 and 25 for a cumulative score of 96 and then edged Australia’s Emma Cox in the shoot-off to upgrade her silver to gold. 
 
 
 
 Shreyasi was joint with Pearson on 49 points after two rounds, with Varsha third with 46, and moved up to second with 22 after the third while Varsha held onto her spot with 21. In the last round, Shreyasi shot the highest of all competitors (25) to confirm herself a silver, and then in the shoot-off with Cox, once the scores were level at 96, she nailed both her shots while the Australian missed her second trap. 
 
 Varsha, currently a senior at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she is majoring in Economics, overcame a poor start to the final round to keep herself in contention for a bronze, but the 54-year-old Pearson’s experience came to the fore as the final round drew to a close and she took bronze with a total of 87 to Varsha’s 86. 
 
 A graduate of Delhi University’s Hans Raj College, Shreyasi won two medals at the 61st national shooting championship in New Delhi last year.
