PUNE: The residents of Aanewadi in Satara district are worried about the fate of former   officer  , who owns a one-acre piece of land in the village. They have urged the government to take necessary steps for his 
  . 

 The villagers said the government had put in great efforts to get soldier   released from Pakistan a few weeks ago. 
 
 "The government must put in similar efforts now to get Jadhav freed," they said.
 
 
  
 
 The residents remember 
  as a person who was actively involved in social work in the village. 
 
 They also recount some of his social contributions, such as distributing school uniforms and blankets to the needy a few years ago.
 
 Though Jadhav does not originally hail from the village, he had purchased the plot of land and was involved in small farming activities over the last ten years.
 
 Speaking to TOI over the phone, village sarpanch   said, "After purchasing the land, Jadhav constructed a small farmhouse where he would stay during his visits. He had leased out the remaining land to a local farmer for cultivation. Jadhav had grown wheat and jowar on his farm in the past." 
 
 Shinde said Jadhav would always offer advise about improving the quality of education at the village school and had donated uniforms for the students five years ago.
 
 Dada Patil, who owns a farm quite close to Jadhav's plot, remembers him as a "family man". 
 
 "He would come visiting the village with his parents. He is a jovial man and would never forget to inquire about my family's whereabouts. Jadhav had donated special blankets to us some years ago," he said.
