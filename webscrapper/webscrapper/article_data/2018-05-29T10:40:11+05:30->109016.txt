CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister Eddapadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O   on Monday expelled an   IT wing functionary from the party on the charge of antiparty activity.

 
 C Hari   was joint secretary of Kancheepuram east district unit of the IT wing. An active Twitter user, the action came hours after he made derogatory comments on journalists on his official twitter handle.
 
 In a statement, the leaders said Prabhakaran has been sacked from the primary membership of the party for having acted against the party’s principles and ideologies and brought disrepute to the party.
 
 “Cadres should not have any truck with him in the future,” the leaders said.
 
 When media houses were denied access to the   hospital on Monday during Panneerselvam’s visit to the injured, which triggered uproar in social media, Prabhakaran took to twitter to make offensive remarks against the journalists.
 
 Two hours after his first derogatory tweet, Prabhakaran tweeted again to express his apologies to those who were hurt. His sacking order came from the party headquarters 30 minutes later.
