NEW DELHI: A highly   had to be offloaded from a   at   early on Tuesday morning as he allegedly got into an argument with the crew and was in no condition to fly. The latest case of disruptive passenger happened on Jet Airways’ Mumbai-Kolkata flight (9W 484) around 2 am on Tuesday.

 
 Given the flyer’s condition, security agencies feel he most likely had drinks after clearing security checks as entering the terminal by showing the ticket and ID card and then checking-in in such a state could not have been possible.
 
 “The aircraft (VT-JBC) pushed back at 2.11 am. The passenger allegedly got into an argument with the crew during pre-take off safety demonstration.
 
 The crew tried their best to calm the passenger (who was on 23-D) but when that did not happen, they informed the captain of the flight who then decided to taxi back to the bay,” said sources.
 
 The airline alerted security agencies and the passenger was handed over to them. “The plane took off with a delay of about 40 minutes after the disruptive passenger was offloaded from the plane at Mumbai,” said a Jet spokesman. The flight had 166 passengers and seven crew members.
 
 However given the flyer’s condition, he had to be taken to a hospital after being administered first aid at the airport. This case has revived the old fear of having bars in post security hold area where passengers can have as much alcohol as they want.
