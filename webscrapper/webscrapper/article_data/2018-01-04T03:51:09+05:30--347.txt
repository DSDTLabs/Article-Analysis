NEW DELHI: A case of alleged   in   similar to the one that rocked   last month has led Delhi high court to question the Centre and the AAP government.

 “The Delhi government had shut down Max Hospital for two days on a similar issue. There cannot be two standards, one for the private hospitals and other for government ones,” Justice Vibhu Bakhru remarked while hearing a plea alleging medical negligence by Safdarjung Hospital in wrongly declaring a newborn dead in June 2017.
 
 The infant was brought back to the hospital and put on a ventilator, but died after 36 hours, as per the petition.
 
 HC asked the government to explain why no action has been taken against the staff or doctors concerned of Safdarjung Hospital and directed its medical superintendent to return all records of the mother and the baby to the family within a week.
 
 The court had last year set up a committee to probe the negligence charge against the hospital. In its findings, the committee, however, told the court that the newborn was an ‘abortus’, as it was a 22-week-old fetus and “did not merit proactive resuscitation” as it was not capable of surviving.
 
 The panel held that there does not appear to be any negligence on the part of the treating doctors. However, the court refused to accept the stand saying that five-month-old fetuses are known to have survived even if those incidents were rare and therefore, it cannot be said that in the instant case the fetus could not have survived.
 
 The court was also unhappy with the ‘disturbing’ manner in which the fetus was handed over to the family in an envelope and directed the hospital to file an affidavit indicating the person responsible for doing so.
 
 It said the affidavit should also indicate if any action was proposed to be taken against the individual in question and listed the matter for further hearing on January 18.
