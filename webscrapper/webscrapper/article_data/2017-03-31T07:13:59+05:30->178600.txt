PUNE: The Mental Healthcare Bill 2016, which makes direct administration of electro-convulsive therapy ( ) without anaesthesia illegal, has found huge support with medical practitioners.

 The bill was passed in the   on Monday. It states that ECT, which involves passing of small electric currents through a patient’s brain to reverse symptoms of mental illness, can be given to selected patients but ‘not without anaesthesia’.
 
 “We need to move with the times. I am sure there was a time when giving direct ECT (without anaesthesia) was the norm, but the world moved to modified ECT (with anaesthesia) over three decades ago and so should we,” psychiatrist   said. 
 
 However, won’t it hit a sizable number of patients in small towns, rural parts and peripheries considering the cost involved and non-availability of anaesthetists? When quizzed about this, Pathare said, “There are nearly 16,000 anaesthetists in India compared to 5,000 psychiatrists. I do not know any town or city in the country where a psychiatrist is available, but there is no anaesthetist.”
 
 Perception plays a big role when it comes to ECT procedure. “People’s perception is usually guided by incorrect dramatization of the ECT procedure in Hindi films. People think of it as a punishment more than a treatment for the mentally ill. With this bill, ECT without anaesthesia has become illegal,” psychiatrist Rohan Jahagirdar said.
 
 ECT is one of the important treatment methods in management of acute psychiatric illnesses, especially schizophrenia and depression. It helps to accelerate the process of treatment along with medication, he added.
 
 “ECT without anaesthesia was done in earlier days when electrical current was directly given to induce seizure. Apart from anxiety provoking and painful, it used to cause injuries since the patient was held down forcefully,” psychiatrist  , president of   (IAP), Pune branch, said. Modified ECT (under anaesthesia) ensures safety, she added.
