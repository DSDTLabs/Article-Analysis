MUMBAI: The   on Wednesday asked the wife of an   to appear before it on Monday in a dispute over   where original occupants are battling for their flats for almost a decade.

  called the wife of builder   to court, after his counsel Zal Andhyarujina said she was the joint owner of a property. The court is trying to ensure that money is raised through sale of the builder’s assets to complete the long-pending redevelopment project and regularize the construction in another project.
 
 Dadarkar was arrested in September last year by the economic offences wing, which had registered a case following orders of the HC.
 
 The court was hearing two matters, pertaining to redevelopment projects by Dadarkar’s firm SD Construction. One case is by Siddharth Nagar Ekta Suprabhat Co-operative Housing Society, Goregaon (West), alleging he cheated them by failing to complete the redevelopment that began in 2007. The other suit is by Satyam Cooperative Housing Society in which the buyers of flat in the free sale component claim to be put in possession of flats in the seven-storey building since 2010-11 without the building having any approvals beyond the third floor.
 
 Advocate Tushar Gujjar, who appeared for the original occupants and buyers, said construction in Ekta Suprabhat was proceeding slowly and asked that the court-appointed architect inspect the site to inform how much work remains to be completed.
 
 Andhyarujina said he was trying to ensure the construction is completed and money raised from sale of properties belonging to Dadarkar or his wife. “Am here to see that the property is regularized and building completed…It is a grim situation for Dadarkar,’’ he said.
