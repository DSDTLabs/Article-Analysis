NAGPUR: Private-aided schools, that come under the purview of Right To Information Act ( ), say it’s a matter of concern as it they are subjected to multiple queries from people not connected with the issue. A seminar has been organized by a principals’ association on April 26 to discuss the issue in which education officials will be present. 

 Rachna Singh, principal of St Ursula Girls High School, said, “We are literally harassed by multiple RTIs and it takes up too much of our time just to clarify their questions. Also, we encounter questions by people that are not even connected with the issue.” Another principal, who did not wish to be named, said, “Most of the time a staff member is kept busy only because of this. Finding records, collating data is taking too much of our time and is not desirable.”
 
 Dipendra Lokhande, district’s education officer (primary section), said, “All schools that take any form of grant from the government, come under RTI and it will have to be complied with. I have, however, seen that overwhelming majority of applications are filed directly with our office now, rather than with schools.” 
 
 The seminar organized by   (SHCA) will also be discussing other crucial issues like Right To Education Act, salary and pension along with the new curriculum for Std X. The other important thing that will be discussed is the state’s flagship programme ‘Pragat Shaikshanik Maharashtra’ (PSM).   is a campaign which started last academic year and aims to raise standards of education in the state. The parameter for testing involves a theory test in math and language to be taken twice or thrice a year along with innovative approaches taken at school level by teachers/educational officials to make studies interesting for students.
