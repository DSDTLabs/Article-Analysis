AHMEDABAD: The   of   has decided to do away with   and has formed a committee to examine   in undergraduate courses. The syndicate also formed a committee to examine a proposal to reduce examination duration to two hours and cut the number of questions in the paper.

 The syndicate, which meet on Thursday, decided that centralized admissions was time-consuming and hence led to delays in beginning studies. The committee decided to allow students to apply online for colleges where they want admission. The colleges will then declare the merit list and admit students.
 
  
  
 In a second important decision, the syndicate decided to form a committee to look into online admissions for undergraduate courses conducted by GU. However, professional courses where the admissions are conducted by the Admission Committee for Professional Courses will continue to have centralized admissions.
 
 The Gujarat University syndicate also decided to form a committee to examine the possibility of reducing the duration of exams for Bachelor of Science, Commerce and Arts. The committee will look into cutting the duration from three hours to two hours. GU feels that for a 70-mark paper, three hours was excessive.
 
 To give relief to students, the committee has been asked to examine if the number of questions can be reduced to four from the existing five. Of the four, three questions would be descriptive and one question will be of multiple choice questions.
 
 The syndicate also approved the Rs 127 crore budget with a Rs 6 crore deficit. The university proposed to start two postgraduate courses in sports which include fitness and diet among others. The committee also discussed a proposal to redeem fixed deposits of the university as there was delay in flow of grants from the state government. The budget also proposed to repair 14 different buildings on the GU campus as they are dilapidated and need urgent attention.
