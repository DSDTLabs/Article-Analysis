BHOPAL: One of the members of the terror module inspired by   (IS),  , lost his nerves at the last minute while placing the bomb on the Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train on Tuesday , investigators of   Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) revealed on Thursday .

 An officer who interrogated him said the 22-year-old placed the bomb on the overhead luggage rack of the train and not below the lower berth as was the plan. The blast would have been far more severe if   had stuck to the original plan. But Atif chickened out at the last minute, fearing that in the process there would be far more casualties than estimated, sources said.
 
 “He wasn't trained for ruthless killings; he is just another boy fascinated by the IS videos,“ said an officer. Atif had proclaimed himself as `emir' of IS's `Khorasan module' in India. What prompted him to carry out a terror strike in Madhya Pradesh still remains a mystery. Atif was pursuing a diploma course in leather and footwear technology engineering from a university in UP. However, he dropped out midway .
 
 He has been subjected to several ro unds of interrogation in the last 48 hours.. His laptop has been recovered and “his browsing history and chat records would clear the remaining story“, said an officer. Investigations revealed that the blast plot was finalised only a fortnight ago.
 
 IG (Intelligence) Makrand Deoskar told reporters that Atif and his team had learned to make bomb from `Inspire' -an online magazine reported to be published by al-Qaida in the  . However, no significant evidence of their direct link to any terrorist organisation has been detected so far. Meanwhile, a team of MP ATS has been sent to Lucknow to interrogate Atif 's alleged motivator, ex-IAF airman Ghouse Mohammad Khan
