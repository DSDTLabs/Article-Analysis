 Carrying forward his legacy of making unique and unconventional cinema, filmmaker   has come up with a fiercely political film, 'Daas Dev'. Touted to be a reverse story of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay’s famed Devdas, with significant touches and influences of Shakespearean dramas like Hamlet, the film has an ensemble cast comprising   as Paro, Aditi Rao Hydari as Chandni and Rahul Bhat as Dev. Also seen in the film are Vineet Singh, Saurabh Shukla and Vipin Sharma with a guest appearance by Anurag Kashyap.
 
 Daas Dev is an album that will take you by surprise — not because it has seven songs, but because in this day and age, the album does not have a single remake. And these seven original, powerful tracks are quite commendable. The album has some of the most talented poets and writers in terms of lyricists.
 
 Five different music directors have helmed the seven tracks. Two songs have been composed by Sandesh Shandliya —Challa Chaap Chunariya sung by   has been written by Deepak Ramola and Raat Din Yunhi sung by   and Shradha Mishra has been penned by Faiz Ahmad Faiz. 
 
 There are two tracks by Vipin Patwa — Sehmi Hai Dhadkan sung by Atif Aslam has been penned by Dr Sagar and Tain To Uttey sung by Javed Bashir has been written by Bulle Shah. 
 
 The fifth, Rangdaari sung by Navraj Hans and Arko P Mukherjee, who has also composed the song; the lyrics have been penned by Arko and Munir Niazi. The next, Azaad Kar composed by Anupama Raag has been sung by   and written by Gaurav Solanki. Shamir Tandon’s Marne Ka Shauk has been rendered by Papon and Krishna Berua and written by Sameer Anjan.
 
 Each song competes with the other and vies for the top slot. All the seven, very contemporary tracks are poetic and yet have a unique commercial appeal. This album gives you not just the rhythm, groove and tune but some great lyrics as well.s
