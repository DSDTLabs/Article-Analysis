 of SSLC answersheets of a student from a school in Bantwal taluk, Mangaluru, has brought to the fore serious discrepancies in tabulation as well as valuation.

 
 Mohammed Tameem, a student from SLNP Vidyalaya in Panemangalore, Bantwal, scored 24 marks in Hindi in SSLC exams, but on re-evaluation, it turned out that he’d scored 78.
 
 “We have achieved 100% results for seven consecutive years. In Hindi, Tameem secured 18 out of 20 in internals and 6 out of 80 during finals. He couldn’t have scored such less marks as he is a bright student. We applied online for a photocopy of his answersheet, and found that the evaluator, while filling in the OMR sheet, had made a serious error –– instead of writing 60, he wrote 6,” said  , headmistress, SLNP.
 
 Before re-evaluation, the total marks scored by Tameem were 382, which has now gone up to 436. “It’s better that evaluators make correct tabulations, otherwise it creates confusion and agony among students,” she added.
 
 Students have to pay Rs 305 for the photocopy of an answersheet and Rs 705 for reevaluation. The amount is refundable in case of errors made in evaluation.
 
 TOI had reported that Alister Kevin Bangera from   scored 57 marks in English. Re-evaluation of his paper revealed that he had actually scored 97.
