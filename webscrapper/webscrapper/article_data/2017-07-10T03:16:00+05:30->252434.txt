Nagpur: The Hingna forest range officials, on intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, seized 97 cattle grazing illegally in Ambazari reserve forest. Of the 97 bovines, 53 are cows while 44 are buffaloes. TOI, on Sunday, published a photograph showing how cattle were devouring the plantations undertaken during the seven-day drive from July 1 to 7. The picture was taken by a TOI reader and environment lover from his sixth floor apartment adjoining the forest area. The cattle were deliberately pushed inside on Saturday evening by the owners from Wadi area through the open space where work to construct compound wall is in progress. The cattle were thoughtfully driven inside considering Saturday and Sunday as holidays and there would be no action. When TOI pointed out this to Hingna range forest officer (RFO) AS Ninawe, he immediately rushed staff to the forest and started seizing cattle. All the cattle have been detained. The drive to detain the cattle continued till 2.30am. There were no big sheds at the spot but a makeshift shed was created at night where all animals were kept. “On Sunday morning, at least 10 cattle owners from Wadi approached us to release the cattle but we will do it only after charging heavy penalty,” said Ninawe. Earlier, these cattle used to be released for a paltry amount of Rs500 and 1,000 per cattle. “Now there are orders from the top to charge at least Rs5,000 per animal,” said Ninawe. Had cattle grazing continued, the animals would have destroyed all saplings planted under the 4 crore drive during Van Mahotsav from July 1-7.
