LUCKNOW: Chalking out a plan for the ‘Power for all’ scheme, the   has started working on a model to provide round-the-clock power to registered consumers, urban as well as rural, from October 2018. A proposal to this effect is scheduled to be put before the state cabinet on Tuesday. 

 Energy department sources said the proposal seeks to roll out 24x7 power supply to the existing 1.8 crore consumers. The new proposal aims to do better than the previous government’s plan to provide   power supply to urban and 16 to 18 hours to rural areas. 
 
 Sources said the proposal seeks to carry out feeder separation in at least 39 districts where power load is extremely high, thereby hampering smooth electricity supply. “Most of the feeders are in rural areas of the districts,” said a senior   official privy to the development.
 
 Energy department is also aiming to enhance the capacity of some of the power generating units within a period of one year so that more power is available across the state. The department will also bank on power purchase through banking, bilateral arrangement and through energy exchange. Sources said the state government will also try to expedite electrification of rural areas under the Centre’s Deendayal Upadhyay Rural Electrification Scheme. This will be apart from the Integrated Power Development Scheme which envisages betterment of power supply in the urban areas.
