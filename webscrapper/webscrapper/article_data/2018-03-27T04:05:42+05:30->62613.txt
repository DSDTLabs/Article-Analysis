Mumbai: With results of most law faculty courses pending, some law exams slated to begin in April could be postponed. The university will issue revised dates of exam commencement in a week. Students, however, claim that there will still be little time left to seek re-valuation. 

 A student said the semester V repeaters' (ATKT) exam is to begin on April 18. "We are yet to get our semester V result. How do we fill the form for repeaters' exam in 10-15 days without knowing what subjects we've failed in? When do we apply for re-valuation?" asked the student.
 
 Only about five results of the law faculty, have been announced so far. A university official said, "Law now comes under humanities faculty. Most colleges do not have enough approved faculty. To get teachers working on clock-hour basis to assess papers within a stipulated time is a challenge for the university," said the official.
 
 A university official said that the assessment of law papers is still on. "We are expecting some of the law results to be announced in the next few days. But the exams that are scheduled to start in April will have to be postponed. The examination section has taken a decision and will issue the new schedule soon," said the official. The university may postpone some of the exams under other faculty too, where results are awaited.
