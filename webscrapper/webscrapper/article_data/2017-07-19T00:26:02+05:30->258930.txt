Pune: City-based seismologist   along with two other scientists Dong Choi and Sergey Pulinets were able to predict the 7.8 magnitude   that occurred on Tuesday morning off the coast of  's Kamchatka Peninsula, five months ago.

 The observation given on January 25 this year by the trio says, “Various catestrocrafic mega warning signals have been detected during the past few months, indicating the possibility of a large (>M7.0) earthquake off the east coast of Kamchatka. In addition, concerns for a major quake in this region have been posted by other researchers and the Russian government.”
 
 “The exact time period cannot be predicted in these cases but we had said that it would be in 2017, this earthquake will hit offshore Kamchatka,” Arun Bapat, consulting seismologist at International Earthquake and Volcano Prediction Centre (IEVPC), said.
 
 After the earthquake, tsunami warnings were issued by the Russian authorities. These were predicted clearly by the group five months ago.
 
  “Additional updates may be provided as new precursor signals occur. A trans-Pacific Ocean tsunami may be generated by this type of earthquake associated with faults in this region,” the advisory said.
 
 Talking about their research in predicting earthquakes, Bapat said, “Our study demonstrated the role of geological structures, particularly deep fracture systems in understanding earthquake formation mechanisms. The deep fracture systems also affect many phenomena which appear prior to major shallow earthquakes including precursor shocks, thermal regime on earth and atmosphere, and other global and local geophysical and electromagnetic signals. The deep fracture systems continuing from the continent to the ocean floor negate the application of plate tectonics to the Northwest Pacific region and beyond.”
