ATTARI: Clouds of uncertainty are hovering over the   through India's first   (ICP) at   land border after a standoff between truck union leaders and   on the issue of hiring of trucks. Following this, the   had announced an indefinite strike in protest. 

 On Monday, there was partial impact of the strike at the ICP with almost no lifting of goods being imported from Pakistan. But in the coming days the trade could come to a halt if the truck union didn't withdraw the strike. 
 
 The agitating truck union has demanded that only their trucks should be hired and these should not be overloaded. But the traders have refused to bow to the dictats of the truck union and is adamant on doing business on their own terms.
 
 Deputy Commissioner, Customs, ICP, Balwinder Singh told TOI that exports were normal but imports had been hit.
 
 President of the truck union Harinderpal Singh Lalli said that the union truck drivers were at loss since importers and exporters were not hiring union trucks. "Moreover, they force us to overload our vehicles," he alleged, adding that they had made up their mind to go on an indefinite strike. 
 
 He said government had acquired 121 acres and many of them had purchased trucks to make both ends meet. But now traders were not hiring union trucks while the government preferred to look the other way. "Families of over 600 operators are suffering," he said.
 
 On the other and, president of the Kiryana and Dry Fruit Merchant Association Anil Mehra said that the trade couldn't be allowed to be held hostage by an unruly mob of truckers and they would not allow them to dislodge the trade with their nefarious activities. 
 
 Confederation of International Commerce and Industry has condemned the truck union "for disrupting the international trade". It said that they had repeatedly complained to police officials against the unruly behaviour of the truck union.
