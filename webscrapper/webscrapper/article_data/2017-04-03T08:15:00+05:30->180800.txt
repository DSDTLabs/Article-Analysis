MUMBAI: Parents of students of PG Garodia School in   are up in arms against the management over a proposal to   fees by 25% from the next academic year. The school authorities claimed the hike would be brought into effect only after approval from executive members of the parents-teachers’ body.

 After the management built a new building with additional facilities, calling it the PG Garodia International Centre, the parents were apprehensive about the school’s long-term plans. “Some school authorities have been unofficially asking children to seek admission to the new centre. Currently, we pay an average of Rs 2 lakh annually; in the new centre, the   will be around Rs 6-7 lakh, which would be 300% more than what we are paying now. What if they shut down the existing campus in the near future?” said a parent. He added that the fee hike proposed in the current programme was high and they were planning to complain to the director of education.
 
 Nishant Garodia, the school’s director, said the management was discussing the hike with the PTA, and there was a meeting in the first week of April to finalise it. 
 
 “We have no plans to shut down the existing campus. Since we are starting a new centre, we thought we would offer the choice of shifting to our existing parents first. It will be their choice,” said Garodia, adding that the school is increasing fees once in two years. The state government permits 15% fee hikes in two years, and if it is more, it has to get PTA approval.
