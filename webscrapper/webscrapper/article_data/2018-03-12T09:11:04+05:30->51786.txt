Chief minister Siddaramaiah’s visit to Koratagere on Sunday witnessed rare bonhomie between him and   president G  . Both leaders appeared comfortable in the company of each other and Siddaramaiah even made a fervent appeal to the people of Koratagere to ensure Parameshwara’s victory in the assembly elections.

 The chief minister’s appeal holds significance since he — in political circles at least — was accused of ensuring Parameshwara’s defeat in the 2013 assembly elections to avoid possible competition for the chief minister’s post. Parameshwara, as president of the state  , would have naturally claimed stake to the post and the party high command would have found it difficult to ignore his claim.
 
 Amidst ringing applause from party workers at function on Sunday, Siddaramaiah said, “Under no circumstances, he (Parameshwara) should lose the election this time. If he wins, it is like   winning the election. We both are like brothers and have no differences.”
 
 The opposition BJP wasted no time in criticizing Siddaramaiah. “People of Koratagere have a special guest. #10PercentCM @ siddaramaiah is visiting Koratagere for Thanksgiving! After all he owes his CM’s post to them. He ensured Parameshwar’s defeat in 2013 to deny him CM’s post,” state BJP president B S   tweeted.
 
 
 
 Members of Madiga community, who have been demanding the implementation of the Sadashiva Commission report and internal reservation among SCs, attempted to wave black flags at Siddaramaiah. However, police disbursed the mob by caning them. The state government recently decided to set up a corporation for the development of the community in a bid to push their demands back burner.
