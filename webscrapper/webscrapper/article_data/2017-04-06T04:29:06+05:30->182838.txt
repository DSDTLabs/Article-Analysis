MUMBAI: If you thought BMC was not serious about dealing with complaints, perish the thought. Staff from K-East ward landed up at a highrise in Marol on Wednesday to take away furniture from a makeshift housing society office merely because it amounted to 'illegal' usage of parking area.

 In all, 13 plastic chairs from Shanti Towers were seized. BMC could not cart away the table as society chairperson   sat on it and insisted that she be taken along if the table was being confiscated. Cupboards were also spared in the process.
 
 The society is locked in a battle with one of its residents,  , who has not paid maintenance dues for four years amounting to Rs 2.5 lakh.
 
 The stilt area has been used as society office for 20 years.Fernandes in 1998 had sought to purchase the area as it abuts his parking lot. Since the society did not have a society office it refused to sell the area to him.Fernandes did not respond to TOI's calls and messages.
 
 â€œThe opening to the stilt area is too narrow for anyone to ived a letter from BMC saying it should remove chairs, tables, cupboards and gymnasium equipment in the stilt area. The society wrote back to say it had not carried out civil construction and that the furniture was movable. Advocate   said BMC did not cite which law was violated.
 
 Devendra Jain, K-East ward officer said the action was taken for illegal usage of the parking area.
