GURUGRAM: About 200 trees were cut down in the Raisina area of the   on Wednesday, reported  . 

 The environmental violation came to light after green activists, along with members of Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), caught some people cutting the trees in the protected area. The tree cutting took place around an illegal construction that was seized by the forest department some 15 days ago.
 
 “It was so shocking to see that at least 1.5-acre area has been cleared near the illegal construction that was seized by the forest department a few days ago. The attempt was to cut trees to clear the Aravalis for encroachment. How can the forest department miss such a grave violation taking place in broad daylight? We have been reporting violations every day, but the department claims that there has been no   and encroachment,” said Vaishali Rana Chandra, an environmental activist.
 
  The activists threatened to file a complaint with the director general of the forest as the district forest department allegedly remains incapable of checking continuous tree felling in the Aravalis. 
 
 “We have no option but to make an appeal to the union environment ministry to take a stern step. We request environment ministry to issue some advisory to the district department to check both tree felling and encroachments in the Aravalis. Otherwise, we have no option, but move the judiciary. There is already a petition going to the  . We can become party to that petition,” said Shivani Sharma, honorary animal welfare officer, AWBI. TOI has reported three instances of tree felling in the last 15 days.
