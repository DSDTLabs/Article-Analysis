AMRITSAR: All Sikh politicians who sought help from Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda head   in the run-up to the Punjab elections will have to appear before Sikh temporal seat  , irrespective of the party they belong to.

 Akal Takht jathedar Gurbachan Singh made this announcement on Monday. The jathedar said all Sikh leaders who met the Dera chief had violated the Akal Takht’s edict issued in 2007 that had asked all members of the community to severe ties with the sect over its head making an appearance in an attire similar to that of the 10th Sikh master, Guru Gobind Singh.
 
 The jathedar said he had received the report of three member sub-committee constituted by Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to investigate into the Sikh leaders who violated the edict. “I will go through the report and will convene a meeting of the Sikh high priests in about two days. We will then summon all such leaders for clarification,” he said.
 
 However, the jathedar did not divulge the names of any Sikh leaders who met Gurmeet Singh. “I am yet to go through the report of sub-committee,” he said.
 
 On February 1, three days ahead of the assembly elections, the Sirsa-based Dera had announced to extend its support to SAD-BJP, creating ripples in Panthic circles. The SAD came under sharp criticism for taking the sect’s help. Besides, several Congress and AAP leaders were said to have visited the dera to seek support.
 
 As the anger of Sikh bodies grew against Akalis, Akal Takht jathedar Gurbachan Singh directed SGPC to constitute a committee to investigate into the role of Sikh leaders who had gone to the Dera to seek support. Following the Akal Takht directives, SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar constituted a three-member subcommittee comprising its senior vice-president Baldev Singh Kiampuri, executive member Gurcharan Singh Garewal and general secretary Amarjit Singh Chawla. The panel submitted its report to the jathedar on Monday.
