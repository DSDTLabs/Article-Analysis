THANE: Hundreds of families in   and its surrounding pockets along   had no supply of domestic gas for around 10 hours on Tuesday following a freak accident which damaged the   (MGL) pipeline in the area. The mishap took place at around 1pm near Lodha Splendora complex in Waghbil village. 

 Officials said a JCB was deployed at the spot for road digging work. A few locals who saw the machine burning up in flames intimated the Balkum fire brigade team.
 
 An official from the fire station said, “We got a call in the afternoon. The driver of the JCB machine who was operating the equipment was in the process of digging the road. We think that the machine may have accidently touched the MGL pipeline underneath. The wires may have come in contact causing a short-circuit.”
 
 It took fire officials almost 10 hours to carry out the repair work after which supply was restored by 11pm. Meanwhile, residents unaware of the sudden shut-down were calling MGL customer care number and were forced to make alternative food arrangements for the day.
