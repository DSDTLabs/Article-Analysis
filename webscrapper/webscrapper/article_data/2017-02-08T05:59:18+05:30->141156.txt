AHMEDABAD: Accident patterns in the city have not changed much with the periphery of the city still more likely to report more accidents. An analysis by   (NCRB) shows that city police have reported most fatal accidents in and around residential areas.

 The category reported three times more accidents than the second category, industrial areas. The report highlighted plight of pedestrians as 40 persons died while in the pedestrian zone, crossing the road at a crossroads or on a zebra crossing. Likewise, the vicinity of educational institutes reported the same number of fatal accidents.
 
  “Each area of a city has very different characteristics — residential, industrial, business district — or a mix of different factors. Road accidents take place due to human, technical or infrastructural issues. While there is no sure-shot remedy for preventing crashes, the only way out is to understand traffic composition and plan the flow accordingly,” said a city-based road safety expert.
 
 According to the recent  , road stretches such as Panjrapol to Vastrapur, Underpass to Pakwan Crossroads on SG Road, Ashram Road,   to Gurukul and   to Paldi bus stand were found to be reporting a high rate of accidents.
 
 The same report mentioned that two-wheelers were the most affected class with involvement in 101 accidents followed by cars (87), trucks (65), buses (57) and auto rickshaws (41).
 
 “On the basis of the accidents in previous years, a number of places in the city such as Sola Flyover have been declared accident-prone zones. Speed limits have also been decided on the basis of traffic flow and road infrastructure. Coordination meetings with various authorities have two major agenda — reducing chances of accident and de-congesting roads. Not allowing a right turn at a few crossroads was part of the same drive,” said a senior city traffic branch official.
