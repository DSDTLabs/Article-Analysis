NEW DELHI: Students of Delhi University’s   department have demanded the   of the head of department against whom complaints were recently filed in the   harassment cell or the Internal Complaints Committee. They’ve written to the vice-chancellor. 

 TOI had earlier reported about a teacher and a postgraduate student of the department accusing Ramesh Chandra of harassment. In her complaint, a copy of which is with TOI, the teacher had complained of being humiliated by Chandra in front of six male faculty members during an interview for an ad hoc position in the department on November 6, 2017. She had been teaching there for over six years. 
 
 ICC launched an investigation against Chandra, but students claimed despite ICC rules saying that a teacher could be suspended pending inquiry, Chandra was allowed to continue. 
 
 “Why was he allowed to continue despite the rule?” a student said outside the VC office. 
 
 The students have alleged in their letter that they are harassed by Chandra who passes “derogatory and sexually-coloured remarks”. A senior   official confirmed that the ICC panel was about to arrive at a decision. But Chandra maintained that the allegations were baseless and meant to malign him.
 
 He said the protest was at the behest of some teachers “for they want the complainant to become the HoD”. 
 
 The students also claimed that election of the department, including that of the sexual   grievance body, was suddenly cancelled when Chandra realised that his chosen candidates would lose. But Chandra said polls were cancelled due to lapses and would be held later.
