NEW DELHI: India reacted angrily to Pakistani high commissioner 
  on the occasion of Pakistan Day, saying this was not in keeping with diplomatic niceties and was tantamount to interference in India's internal affairs. 

 This was even as both President Pranab Mukherjee and PM   wrote to their counterparts, Mamnoon Hussain and Nawaz Sharif respectively, conveying their best wishes and desire to have good relations with Pakistan in an atmosphere free of terror and violence.
 
 Reiterating support for the "freedom struggle" of the Kashmiris at a function at the high commission, Basit expressed hope that the struggle would succeed one day.
 
 "We have seen media reports about Pakistan high commissioner's remarks today regarding the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. They are not in keeping with diplomatic niceties and are tantamount to 
  ," said MEA spokesperson Gopal Baglay.
 
 "Pakistan would be well-advised to effectively address the challenge of terrorism emanating from that country, which has adversely affected peace and stability in the entire neighbourhood as well as Pakistan's relations with other countries," he added.
 
 Addressing a gathering at the high commission here, Basit said the J&K issue must be resolved as per the "aspirations of Kashmiris".
 
 The Pakistani envoy also asserted that the aspirations of people "can be suppressed but not quelled and I hope the struggle of the Kashmiris will prove successful".
 
 A reception later in the evening at the high commission was attended by junior foreign minister M J Akbar. Speaking the reception, Basit also said that while Pakistan may not be a rich country, it was the happiest country in the region. He was quoting from a UN World Happiness Report, according to which India ranked lowest in the South Asia region. The reception, like in the past, was attended by Hurriyat leaders.
