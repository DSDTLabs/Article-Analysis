Chennai: Buoyed by investments in infrastructure, real estate and financial services, deal making in January-March 18 (Q1) was off to one of the best starts ever since 2008, reporting investments worth $7.9 billion across 180 deals. Large value deals (over $100 million) continued to dominate activity.  The quarter recorded $1.8 billion in exits, 10% lower than last year ($2 billion, 61 exits) and 51% lower than the previous quarter ($3.7 billion, 64 exits), according to a report by consulting major EY. Q1 investments outstripped the previous Q1 high recorded in 2008 of $4.6 billion by 72%. It was also the second best quarter ever since $8.7 billion recorded in Q3 of 2017.  This uptick in Q1 was primarily aided by $3.1 billion worth of investments made in the infrastructure and real estate sectors.  This was also the highest ever quarterly investment by the PE/VC industry in infrastructure and real estate. Vivek Soni, partner and leader for private equity advisory, EY said, “PE/VC (private equity/venture capital) investment activity is clearly on a high. Jan-Mar 2018 has been the strongest first quarter in recent years and we believe this year will be strong across all asset classes of PE, infrastructure and real estate.” “Exits have been muted compared to the previous quarter largely on account of volatility in the capital markets.  However, there are strong under currents of M&A at play. If they materialise and capital markets hold fort, PE/VC exits in 2018 should end on a good note,” he said. Investments in infrastructure and real estate, by PE/VC funds in Q1 2018, were more than 50% of the amount invested in these asset classes in the whole of 2017. Besides these large investments into infrastructure and real estate, quarterly PE/VC investments have taken a dip in Q1 2018, closing at $4.8 billion after $5.6 billion in Q4 2017. However, on a year-on-year basis, Q1 2018 remains the best Q1 for PE/VC investments even after setting aside these large investments in infrastructure and real estate. There were 13 deals of value greater than $100 million made during the quarter aggregating to $5.7 billion accounting for 72% of total investments made, six of which were into infrastructure and real estate. The largest deal during the quarter saw GIC, KKR and others invest $1.7 billion into HDFC Limited. The quarter also recorded the first ever investment by National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), India’s sovereign wealth fund wherein Hindustan Infralog Private Limited, a JV between NIIF and DP world, bought 90% stake in Continental Warehousing Corporation (Nhava Sheva) Limited for $400 million. The deal provided an exit to a clutch of early investors including Warburg Pincus, IFC and others. Taking the trend seen in 2017 forward, the financial services sector remained a hotbed for investments with $2.9 billion invested across 31 deals, the highest quarterly investment into the sector.
