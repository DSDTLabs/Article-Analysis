NAVI MUMBAI: The civic body is yet to acquire the 34-acre plot in   for its new   site as the Urban Development department (UDD) is demanding Rs 194 crore from   to transfer the plot. 

 As per transfer conditions, NMMC has to pay the price as per the ready reckoner rate, said civic sources. 
 
 NMMC has been in touch with UDD for over a month to waive the amount. “We have been corresponding with the state to hand over the plot free of cost. According to GR 2003, land reserved for landfill purposes should be given free of cost,” said the additional municipal commissioner  . 
 
 “NMMC has been operating the existing landfill site on the 65-acre land handed over by the state (see box). As 4 acres came under disputed land, the remaining 34 acres are to be handed over,” said an official. 
 
 While mayor   said he is unaware of the whole issue, Sena corporator   blamed it on civic failure to prepare the city development plan. “This situation would have never occurred if there was a DP, as the land would have been shown reserved for landfill and no cost would have been levied,” said Patkar. 
 
  BJP MLA Manda Mhatre has been pursuing the issue of the new landfill after locals demanded closure of the existing dumpyard. 
 
 “Locals protested the extreme unhygienic condition they were living under as the landfill site was saturated. I pursued the matter with the chief minister and it was decided that the 34-acre plot will be transferred,” said the MLA.
 
 But Mhatre is not happy about the way the issue is being handled by NMMC. “The matter could have been resolved if the administration had approached me. However, I will discuss the matter with the CM.” 
 
 There was no mention of the civic body having to pay to acquire the land, she added.
