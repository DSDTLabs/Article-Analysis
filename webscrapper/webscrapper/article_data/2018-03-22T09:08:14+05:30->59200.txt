BENGALURU: The Government Model Higher Primary School in Byatarayanapura, off  , was all decked up on Wednesday for the arrival of Mysuru royal couple   and Trishika Kumari Wadiyar. 

 The couple were invited by NGO Kalisu for the launch of a   library in the school. The NGO, which has started many libraries in government schools in Mysuru, has launched one in Bengaluru for the first time, with   as its ambassador. 
 
 The students flooded Yaduveer with a volley of questions seeking to know his hobbies, favourite city and the dress he would like to wear other than the typical Maharaja attire among other things. A smiling Wadiyar answered them, saying he loves Mysuru and tennis and guitar are his pastimes. “I wear normal clothes like anyone else,” he said.
 
 “Do you prefer government or private school for your son?” was one of the questions posed to the couple by Deepika V, a Class 7 student. Yaduveer said his child is just three months old and it’s too early to decide about the choice of school.
 
 Priya M, a Class 7 student, asked him: “Which ruling/administration was better? The current one or that of the maharajas?” “We have not seen how the administration was then, but we have heard good things about it and have high regard for the same. But we have all grown up in the current system of administration and prefer this,” Yaduveer said.
 
 The excited lot borrowed teachers’ smartphones and merrily took selfies with the guests. Teachers and locals too were not behind in preserving the occasion for posterity.
 
 More than 3,000 Kannada and English books on various subjects have been made available for children in the library. “We will keep it open during summer holidays as we conduct special activities for children,” headmaster   said.
