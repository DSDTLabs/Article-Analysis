NEW DELHI: Four Rashtriya   ( ) workers were attacked on Saturday allegedly by a group of Communist Party of India (Marxist)(CPI-M) workers in Kerala's Kozhikode district, ANI reported on Sunday.

 "A   worker was also attacked in the southern most state of India," the news agency said, adding that all the injured have been taken to the nearest hospital for treatment.
 
 
  The victims, all in their early 20's, suffered injuries in their hands and legs in the attack last night at Keezhaiyur village and have been admitted to the Medical College Hospital in Kozhikode.
 
 Meanwhile, the state police have launched a manhunt to nab the accused.
 
 Kerala has been witnessing a series of political clashes between cadres of BJP-RSS and ruling CPI(M), especially in the northern Kannur district, for a long time.
 
 Both parties have blamed each other for the cycle of violence, which has claimed several lives on both sides.
