LUCKNOW: Clerics, including principal of Islamic seminary Darul-Uloom  , backed chief minister   on Saturday and said they were hopeful that the SP government would return to power in the state. 

 A delegation of clerics, who met the CM at his official residence, said everyone is free to vote as per their choice in a democracy and that it was unfortunate that some people are appealing to Muslims to exercise their vote on religious lines. Nadwa’s principal, Maulana Saeedurrahman Azmi Nadwi, known to be apolitical and who was a part of the delegation, said in the present political scenario, it is important that the secular votes do not get split. 
 
 The visit gains importance in the backdrop of Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad’s criticism of the SP government earlier this week.
