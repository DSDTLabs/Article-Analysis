BHUBANESWAR: The potato mission, launched by the government to enhance production in the state, has failed to achieve its target. In 2015-16, when the mission was launched, production of potato is estimated at 2.78 lakh metric tonne (MT), nearly one lakh MT below than the target of 3.74 lakh MT, agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy informed in a written reply to the assembly on Wednesday. 

 Though officials in the horticulture department expect a bumper crop in 2016-17, they are optimistic about achieving the target of 4.68 lakh MT. "It's true that we could not achieve the target set under the mission but there has been a slight increase in total production compared to 2014-15. Last year's weather condition did not suit potato cultivation," said an officer in the horticulture directorate.
 
 Lack of quality seeds and unfavourable weather condition are the key factors behind low potato production in Odisha, feels expert. The agriculture minister, in his reply, admitted that the state is yet to produce potato seeds used by farmers. "We procure seeds from  , National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation and other affiliated agencies," Maharathy said.
 
 Odisha needs nearly 12 lakh MT of potato annually and depends upon  ,  , Uttar Pradesh and   to meet the requirement. "Construction of eight cold storages has already been completed, while 26 more are under construction," Maharathy said.
 
 Rourkela MLA Dilip Ray, however, took a dig at the agriculture minister as the figures he provided in the reply do not match with the figures suggested in the state Economic Survey- 2016-17.
