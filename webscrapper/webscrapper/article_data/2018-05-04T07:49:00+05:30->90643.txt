Manali: Globally notorious for production of world’s best charas, ancient Malana village of Kullu is now under the scanner in relation to a counterfeit currency racket operating in the state.

 This is for the first time that cops have raided the village to search for fake currency. Police have arrested a villager, identified as Deva, in connection with fake currency worth Rs 2.1 lakh seized from Mandi. Another suspect is still at large.
 
 Though police have not recovered fake currency from the village, a special investigation team has been constituted to unfold the Malana connection.
 
 On April 26, Mandi police received a complaint from Himachal Gramin Bank manager at Gohar village in the home constituency of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur about a person wanting to deposit fake currency worth Rs one lakh in Rs 2,000 denomination.
 
 Police arrested the person, identified as Lal Singh, a resident of Bhad village in Gohar area. On searching his house, police seized 55 more fake notes worth Rs 1.1 lakh.
 
 Mandi DSP (headquarters) Hitesh Lakhanpal said the accused told police that he worked in Malana village and received the money against the labour he put in. “He has named a person Deva, a resident of Malana, as source of the currency. We have arrested Deva for further investigation. Another person is absconding. The special investigation team has been constituted and cops are solving the puzzle in Malana village,” he added.
 
 The police are checking if the currency was printed in Himachal or sourced from other place. They are also checking if the case has connection with drug trade.
 
 Malana had remained in news for charas smuggling for the last few decades. Foreigners also visit the village to buy charas. Most residents of the village whose population is nearly 2,500 are illiterate. Only two youths from the village have completed graduation. According to sources, most residents are incapable of identifying original and fake currencies.
