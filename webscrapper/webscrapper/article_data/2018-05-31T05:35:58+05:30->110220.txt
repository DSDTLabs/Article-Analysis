MUMBAI: Taking note of a TOI report, corporators on Wednesday demanded a   inquiry into the incident of two persons tampering with the municipal commissioner's remarks on a file on the acquisition of a plot in Jogeshwari. 

 Samajwadi Party leader in the   Rais Shaikh, raising a point of order in the civic standing committee meeting, said, "If such an incident could happen in broad daylight, how secure are files in the development plan (DP) department at the civic headquarters? Many pertain to civic-owned properties worth crores. Had this tampering not been noticed, the property in question could have been lost to a private party. The incident couldn't have occurred without the involvement of an insider."
 
 Shaikh said the BMC administration doesn't take enough care of crucial files. He referred to a fire in the  's office in Mahape in December, where the BMC had kept thousands of building proposal department files. "The fire destroyed several files. Water used to douse the flames destroyed even more files. Yet the corporation has done little to estimate the extent of damage."
 
 BJP leader in the BMC Manoj Kotak said the best way to stop file tampering would be a switch to e-governance, "going paperless". Standing committee chairman Yahswant Jadhav ( ) directed the BMC to inquire into the incident and table a report
