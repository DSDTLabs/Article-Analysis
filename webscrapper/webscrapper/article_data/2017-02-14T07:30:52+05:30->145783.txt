KOLKATA: The Park Street police have arrested a wanted extortionist Mohammad Pintu alias   (35) from the   area.According to DC (south) Praveen Kumar Tripathi, Pintu was carrying a sophisticated improvised 7 mm pistol and five cartridges at the time of his arrest. “We are ascertaining if this pistol was to be used for his own misdeeds or if he was trying to sell it off,“ said Tripathi.

 Police said Pintu's arrest from the area will help them reach the real suppliers. “You can buy a 9mm and 7mm -both of which are now equally getting prominence over the single shotters for as low as Rs 25,000-Rs 30,000. The lo cal supply chain is good since so many factories have come up and prices are low. The quality of these guns may not be comparable to imported firearms but they get the job done. However, you need to go through a highly secret channel to buy one. We believe Pintu was trying to ex tort money from at least two local traders,“ said an officer.
