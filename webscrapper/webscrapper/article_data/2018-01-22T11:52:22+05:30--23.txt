CHENNAI: An advocate on Monday approached the   seeking rollback of the hike in bus fares in   even as protests continued across the state against it.

 When a division bench of Justices R Subbiah and T Ravindran commenced their proceedings around 10.30am, advocate George William made an urgent mention about the fare hike and sought the court to hear the plea on an urgent basis.
 
 William said the hike was unjustified and arbitrary. He wanted the court to interfere and direct the government to withdraw the hike which is adversely affecting the people and student community. But refusing urgent hearing, the bench asked the lawyer to file a proper petition which would be taken up for hearing in due course.
 
 After six years, the Tamil Nadu government increased bus fares on January 19. Minimum fare of Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses in Chennai has been increased from Rs 3 to Rs 5, and the maximum from Rs 14 to Rs 23. In case of non-metros, the hike was in the range of Rs 3 to Rs 19.
