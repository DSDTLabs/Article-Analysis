NEW DELHI: The   decided on Tuesday to examine the justification of pension and allowances like   given to former MPs and MLAs. 

 A bench of Justices J Chelameswar and S Abdul Nazeer agreed to hear a plea filed by NGO, Lok Prahari, seeking its direction to scrap allowances given to former lawmakers. 
 
 The court said the issue raised in the petition needs examination as facilities and allowances given to them must be reasonable and not arbitrary.
 
 Questioning the various provisions of the law framed by   allowing former MPs with various allowances, the petitioner alleged that the provisions of pensions and amenities granted to ex-MPs/MLAs/MLCs were unreasonable and called for withdrawal of those facilities.
 
 “While the governors do not have the facility of pension at all, an MP even for a day and his spouse get pension for life. While even serving judges of the Supreme Court and high courts do not have the facility of free air/train travel for their spouses even on official tours, ex-MPs enjoy unlimited free train travel for life in AC-II with a companion 365 days a year,” the petition said.
 
 “This has resulted in the obnoxious situation where a former MP becomes an unwarranted burden on the citizens as it it is their birthright to fleece the public whom they no longer represent. It has made politics the most lucrative profession even for the scum of the society,” former bureaucrat S N Shukla who is also the general secretary of the NGO, told the apex court.
 
 The court, after a brief hearing, adjourned the case for Wednesday and asked advocate   to assist the petitioner in framing the question of law to be adjudicated by the bench.
 
 The petitioner approached the apex court after the Allahabad high court dismissed the plea.
