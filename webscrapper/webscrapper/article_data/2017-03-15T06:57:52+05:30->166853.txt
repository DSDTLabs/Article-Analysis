BENGALURU: The alleged assault on a student from   by his landlord took a serious turn with police adding two more IPC sections in the FIR filed in the case. The sections invoked are 295 on 'deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs' and 355 on `assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour person, otherwise than on grave provocation'.

 Hemanth Kumar, who had allegedly thrashed   Gungtey, a student of   on March 6 at his   residence over a water dispute, had earlier booked for kidnapping and criminal intimidation.
 
 “The student made his second statement on Monday and based on the statement, we added the two IPC sections. We are seeking legal opinion on whether we can arrest the accused again,“ a police officer said. Hemanth was arrested but had to be released as he had obtained anticipatory bail. Northeast community members were unhappy that Hemanth could easily walk out on bail because he had been booked under weaker IPC sections.
 
 Higio lived in a two-bedroom house owned by Kumar, a lawyer, in Hulimavu. On March 6, another tenant living in Kumar's apartment complained that they were facing water scarcity because Higio and his roommates were overusing it. Kumar allegedly abused Higio over phone and later turned up at his house and attacked him. Higio had said Kumar kicked him on his stomach and knees and beat him black and blue for half-anhour. When his shoe fell off, Higio was allegedly asked to put it back and lick it. “In his first complaint, Higio had not mentioned the racial attack issue. It was added on Monday. He has been discharged from hospital,“ cops said.
