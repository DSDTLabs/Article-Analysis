MUMBAI: After spending 18 months behind bars, a prime accused in a multi-crore call centre scam, Jagdish Kanani will be out on bail. Kanani was said to own a call centre in Thane. 

 The   granted Kanani bail, but directed him to surrender his passport. He was arrested on October 16, 2016. A bench of Justice   and Justice R Banumathi on April 9 observed that he has been in custody for nine months and the trial has not yet commenced and hence it was a fit case for bail. There are over 200 witnesses proposed to be examined by the prosecution, his lawyers Kedar Patil and   had argued, which the SC also took into account. 
 
 “Having regard to the period of custody suffered and the likely period which would be taken for completion of the trial we are of the view that an appellant should be released on bail,” said the SC setting aside the Bombay HC order, which had rejected his bail plea last August. The HC had rejected bail pleas made by Kanani, owner of an illegal call centre I-Serve and three others —Akhilesh Singh, Naseem Ghori and Dharmesh Soni—accused in the ‘IRS scam’ or the ‘Mira Road call centre scam’ of October 2016 for various offences, including cheating, conspiracy and offences under the Information Technology Act.
 
  The callers were people who posed as American Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officers. They would call US citizens threatening them with legal consequences for ‘defaulting’ on their debts. The caller would then ‘negotiate’ with the US taxpayer and get them to purchase gift cards and transfer that money through various channels, including hawala, said the police. 
 
 The scam is a modus operandi to launder money, additional public prosecutor Arfan Sait had argued before the HC. In the SC, state lawyer Nishant Katneshwarkar opposed his plea. Kanani denied being owner of I-Serve or of any of the call centres raided in 2016.
