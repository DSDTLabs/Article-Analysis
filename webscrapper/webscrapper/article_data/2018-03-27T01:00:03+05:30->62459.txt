MUMBAI: Even though a   warning was issued for parts of Mumbai and Thane on Monday, there was a drop in maximum temperature compared to a day earlier.

 The maximum recorded on Monday by India Meteorological Department’s Santacruz observatory was 38.7 degrees Celsius, which was a drop compared to 41 degrees a day earlier. At  , the maximum was 36.5 degrees, which was again a drop compared to Sunday’s 38 degrees. At Colaba, the maximum on Monday was 5.2 degrees below normal, while at Santacruz, it was 5.9 degrees below normal. 
 
 Residents said the heat continued on Monday and the drop was not evident. Aman Singh, who works at Fort, said it felt hotter. “On Sunday morning, even the breeze was very hot and it continued on Monday. Considering such unbearable heat barely at the beginning of summer it is scary to think what will happen in the coming months,” said Singh.
 
 From Monday morning, IMD Mumbai had issued a heatwave warning for isolated parts of the city and suburbs. Weathermen said such warnings are generally given when temperatures are 4.5 degrees above normal for two continuous days. The minimum was also on the higher side; at Colaba it was 25 degrees and at Santacruz it was 22.4 degrees.
 
 The relative humidity at Colaba was 67% and at Santacruz it was 20%. Scientists at IMD Mumbai said prevailing easterly winds led to a sharp increase in temperatures. “But we will see a 3-4 degree drop in few days as northerly winds are expected. Generally, during the transition from winter to summer, skies are clear and anti-cyclone conditions cause such a rise in temperature,” said Bhute. 
 
 The maximum temperature, which till Saturday hovered around 31-33 degrees, saw an 8-degree jump at Santacruz from Saturday to Sunday.
