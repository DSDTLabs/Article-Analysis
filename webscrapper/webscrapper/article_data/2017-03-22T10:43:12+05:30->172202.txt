AMARAVATI: It was a virtual street fight at the media point in the transit assembly on Tuesday when women legislators of TDP and   jostled with one another to grab the microphone to speak to the reporters. The drama continued even as the marshals tried in vain to bring the situation under control . 

 As soon as the house was adjourned following an uproar over women's safety issue, TDP MLA V Anitha addressed the media. She levelled serious allegations against late CM YS Rajasekhara Reddy and said that attacks on women have been continuing since the erstwhile   government headed by him. The opposition members took a severe objection to this.
 
 Giddi Eswari, who intervened even as Anitha was speaking, refuted the allegations. Meanwhile, Anitha found fault with Eswari for allegedly saying that she would behead the CM with an axe. 
 
 Denying Anitha's claims, Eswari clarified, "I had never said that I would chop off the CM's head. If the ruling party can prove their baseless allegations, I will resign as a legislator." 
 
 A few minutes later, Anitha, along with a few male TDP members including  , surrounded their YSRC counterparts. They pushed and pulled one another, trying to get hold of the microphones to address the media. Minister Peethala Sujatha pulled the podium on which the microphones were arranged, towards her even as Eswari was talking and the opposition members tried to pull it back. "They are not only trying to prevent us from speaking in the House but are also stopping us outside," YSRC legislators alleged.
 
 "The opposition YSRC members are emulating the unruly behaviour of their party chief Jagan. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable," Peethala Sujatha added.
 
 YSRC legislators Eswari, Pushparani and others eventually left when TDP MLA Anitha accused the opposition members of misbehaviour in the House.
