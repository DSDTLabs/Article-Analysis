 MUZAFFARNAGAR: A 13-year old class VII student here has written to Prime Minister   to save her from a man who has been allegedly sexually harassing her and even tried to kidnap her.
 
 The girl's father said, “She used to go to school in a tempo, and this man even tried to pull her out of the vehicle once. We filed an FIR against him on August 10 after that incident, under sections 354 (assault or criminal force on woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the   and sections of the POCSO Act. But the man was not arrested, and continued to harass my daughter. Now we are being put under pressure by him and other men to withdraw the case.“
 
 After more than a month of police inaction, the girl decided to write to the PM on Monday. “I have asked him to save me from this man, so that I can continue with my studies. He always harasses me wherever I go, and I fear going to school. The PM is my only hope as the police has not done anything although we complained about it,“ the girl told TOI af ter sending the letter.
 
 “I will personally take up the case and en sure the girl is not ha rassed further. I will soon set up an inquiry into the matter,“ said city superintendent of police Omvir Singh.
