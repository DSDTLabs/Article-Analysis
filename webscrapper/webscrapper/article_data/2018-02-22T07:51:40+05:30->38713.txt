BENGALURU: Ahead of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike budget, a citizens's budget report was submitted to mayor   and commissioner   on Wednesday. 

 Compiled by IChangeMyCity, the report includes 67,533 budget inputs, including 44,276 inputs from last year's report which were not taken up for implementation in the 2017-18 budget. 
 
  The inputs dealt largely with five categories: roads and driveability (21%), health and sanitation (19%), footpaths and walkability (18%), trees, parks and playgrounds (15%) and crime and safety (8%). These were the top five categories last year too; other than a reduction in footpaths and walkability category, all other categories have seen an increase in citizen inputs. IChangeMyCity is an initiative of  , a non-profit organisation, to nurture the spirit of active citizenship. 
 
  The campaign reached out to citizens through its website, a budget bus which went out around the city and encouraged citizens to submit inputs, and by making budget forms available at   ward offices and Indira Canteens. 
 
 Last year, 12,468 budget inputs were ultimately included for projects that are currently being implemented.
 
 "We'll categorise the inputs and consider all the suggestions which have more than 15 inputs. So, if there are 15 similar suggestions for a playground, we'll include them in the budget proposal" said Manjunath Prasad.
