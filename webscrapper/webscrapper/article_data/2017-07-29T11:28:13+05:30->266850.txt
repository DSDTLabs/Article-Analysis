 believes continuing to have a career and feeling 'fulfilled' in her professional life makes her a better mother to her two kids. The 50-year-old actress - who has daughter Nahla, nine, with former boyfriend   and  , three, with ex-husband Olivier Martinez - says parenthood has given her skills that help her in work.

  
  
 "Having careers and being fulfilled that way makes us better mother. It makes us better able to operate in our careers with a sense of compassion and empathy that make us better businesswoman. " "We have to have them both and we have to keep trying to figure it out. And we get it wrong sometimes. And guess what, that is OK too,"   said. 
 
 However, the actress admits she always feels 'a little bit guilty' and does not think it is possible to find a perfect balance between work and home life. "You don't ever balance it completely. It's a constant struggle of a little more time there, a little more time here, and feeling a little bit guilty all the time." 
 
 "I just keep telling all my mom friends who work that it's OK to give ourselves a little slack sometime and not let the guilt sit on us so heavily and know that we are doing the best we can," she said.
