HYDERABAD:   Dr C Laxma Reddy announced on Friday that   would be bought to help   reach hospitals in time. This is in addition to the ones already introduced in tribal areas. A call centre with   number will be launched for those who want to use this facility, he said. 

 Gynaecologists and paediatricians would be appointed in hospitals on priority basis and a proposal has been sent to the Telangana Public Service Commission for recruitments to these posts.
 
 When Assembly members, especially women MLAs from TRS and Congress, raised the issue of deaths during deliveries in hospitals, the minister said that the maternal mortality rate was 71 per 1 lakh deliveries while the national rate was 167. “Every day, there are 20-25 deaths in Gandhi Hospital and 25-30 in Osmania Hospital. The number is high because all complicated cases are brought to these major hospitals,” he said. 
 
 The minister said an inquiry had been ordered into the deaths at Niloufer Hospital and action would be taken after the collector gets the report. TRS MLAs Ajmeera Rekha and Konda Surekha, Congress MLA J Geeta Reddy urged the minister to take more steps for the benefit of pregnant women.
