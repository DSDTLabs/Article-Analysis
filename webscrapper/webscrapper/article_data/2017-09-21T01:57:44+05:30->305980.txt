THANE: Civic commissioner   on Wednesday declared that no work will be carried out without following the lengthy tender-driven process after   blamed him of indiscriminately sanctioning select works. 

 The municipal commissioner is authorized under Sections 5 (2) (2) of the BPMC Act to allocate resources for any projects or a civic work in case of an emergency or to allocate instant relief to tide over a certain situation. The law empowers him with executive authority to bypass the process of securing sanction for a project from the general body and nominate contractors for execution of work without following the tendering process.
 
 The corporators, from across party lines, however, claimed that the   was blatantly misusing its executive powers. They alleged that certain works, which did not qualify as emergency, were conveniently taken up and contractors nominated without the general body nod.
