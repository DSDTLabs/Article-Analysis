NEW DELHI: As campaigning in Punjab and Goa came to an end on Thursday,   ( ) finally shifted its focus back to Delhi. 

 Almost two weeks after the North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s standing committee chairperson presented its budget, AAP came out with a detailed analysis, accusing BJP of having ruined the corporations financially.
 
 Municipal elections in Delhi are expected to be held in April. AAP, which was busy with its first elections in Punjab and Goa, had put all its resources, including most members of the Delhi cabinet and MLAs, into these states. Now, with only locals allowed to stay back in the two states, everyone else is on their way back to the capital.
 
 The party’s official stand for the two-week lag in dissecting the budget was that it took time to go through it in detail. Corruption within the three municipal bodies is going to be a major poll issue that the party is planning to raise during campaigning.
 
 AAP’s Delhi convenor Dilip Pandey said that the north corporation will not be able to deliver on promises like a medicity and investment in solar energy as it did not have funds for it.
 
 “The budget exposes the double standards of BJP, which has been opposing the proposed salary hike of MLAs in Delhi, but is building offices for its own councillors, giving them drivers, health insurance etc,” he said. “While the Delhi government has not asked for luxuries like drivers, since there is no car allowance to start with, the corporation has presumed that its councillors, with a salary of Rs 3,000, will be able to afford cars. The only reason it is not asking for a raise in the salary of councillors is because they make money through other corrupt means.” 
 
 “It has also promised amenities like gardens, ayurvedic clinic and a health camp in each ward. What prevented the corporation from developing these in the last 10 years?,” Pandey asked.
