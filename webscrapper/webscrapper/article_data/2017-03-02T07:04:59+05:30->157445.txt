BENGALURU: Rakesh, 7, died after he fell into a storm water drain at   in Ullal, near Kengeri, on Wednesday evening.   personnel took three hours to retrieve the body because it was dark and the drain was filled with sewage.

 Rakesh was the son of daily wage workers Bheemappa and Nagamma, from Kalaburagi. They were working on the constrution of an apartment near the drain.
 
 The accident occurred around 6pm. Officials from the fire control room received a call from a passerby at 6.28pm, informing them abo ut a boy falling into the drain.
 
 A fire department officer said the sewage made it difficult to retrieve the body.
 
 “We understand the child was defecating near drain and fell in. The drain was not very deep, but he couldn't stand up because of the sewage,“ the officer said. In most cases, rescue personnel en ter the water to search for the body. In this drain, the sewage was so dense earthmovers were called in the operation. “In most cases, the body moves at least a few hundred metres; in this case, he was found where he had fallen. It took some time to move the rubbish and fish the body out,“ he said.
 
 BBMP blamed the incident on BDA's incomplete work. Veerabhadrappa B, joint commissioner,   zone, told TOI the incident was a result of BDA leaving its work half-done.
 
 “The BDA was developing Dubasipalya Lake, and BBMP was covering the drain, which is about 100 metres from the lakebed. BBMP engineers have completed the work and covered the drain with slabs. No child could have fallen in there,“ he said.
 
 He added, “The part of the lake that's under BDA has been in dispute.Thanks to this, lake development is not complete. There is a feeder channel between the lake and the drain which was left open, and that's where we suspect the child fell,“ he added.
