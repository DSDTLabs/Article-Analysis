The matter was referred to the student discipline committee, but it was not found to be a case of ragging. The matter is being investigated further,” she said. 
 
 Mehta explained saying, “We came to know that the students had a practical in lab on Thursday. The complainant’s tool box fell on the floor. The students had an argument and the issue escalated. This was not a case of ragging.”
