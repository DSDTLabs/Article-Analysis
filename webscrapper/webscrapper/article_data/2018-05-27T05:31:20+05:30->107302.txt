BEIJING: China increased diplomatic pressure on   on Saturday by urging the self-ruled island’s last African ally, Swaziland, to align with Beijing as Burkina Faso re-established Chinese ties. Taiwan, which is claimed by China as its own, is Beijing’s most sensitive territorial issue. 

 
 Beijing says Taiwan is merely a Chinese province, with no right to state-to-state relations. China has mounted a concerted campaign over the past two years to lure away Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic allies, as it seeks to pressure Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who it fears wants to push for the island’s formal independence. Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo and will defend Taiwan and its democracy. 
 
 On Thursday, the West African state of Burkina Faso said it was severing ties with Taiwan, the second country in a month to abandon Taipei, following the Dominican Republic. 
 
 Taiwan now has only one diplomatic ally left in Africa —the tiny kingdom of Swaziland — and official relations with just 18 nations worldwide, many of them poor nations in   and the Pacific such as Belize and Nauru.
