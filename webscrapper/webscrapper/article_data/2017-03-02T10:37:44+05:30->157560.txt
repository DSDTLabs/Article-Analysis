AMARAVATI: The iconic structures of new capital city Amaravati will be a compilation of best ones from   (Kazakhstan), Putrajaya (Malaysia),   ( ), Washington DC (US), London (UK) and New Delhi (India). The Andhra Pradesh capital city structures will also reflect the original rural culture and flavour of the existing villages in the capital city area.

 The executives of master architect firm,   (F&P) owned by world renowned architect Norman Foster handed over the conceptual designs of the capital city structures to the chief minister   here on Wednesday. It took nearly three hours for the architects to put all the details before the chief minister explaining various distinct features of the designs.
 
 The firm readied four different models for consideration of the state government. Expressing happiness over the inclusion of rarest of the rare features in the designs, chief minister said that the designs would be submitted to the cabinet on Thursday.
 
 After presenting the designs and taking feedback from the ministers, it would be thrown open to the public to send their feedback. “Amaravati is not going to be developed as a mere city. It should be distinct in all aspects and global class in many fields,“ said the chief minister. He said that Norman Foster had readied the designs in such a short period.
