Chennai: It’s the season for SUVs and MG Motor India, one the newest entrants in the Indian passenger vehicle market, is likely to hit the market with two SUVs in the next two years. 

 According to sources,   India, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Chinese automotive giant SAIC, may go with the GS and ZS   models for its India foray, starting with the Hyundai Creta competitor GS in the first half of the next financial year.
 
 However, company officials said the product planning was still being finalised so the final details were not yet available. P Balendran, executive director, MG Motor India said, “The SUV segment is doing really well in India and we are certainly looking at (products) in that segment among other options. Our first product should hit the market in the first half of the next financial year but I cannot confirm which models because those details are still being worked out.’’
 
 MG Motor India is investing around Rs 2,000 crore in the Indian market and is currently in the process of refurbishing the Halol plant of SAIC’s former partner GM India. 
 
 “We took over the Halol plant in September and we are working on getting it ready for production. The current plant capacity is 75,000 units per annum which can be further expanded, depending on the market requirement,’’ said Balendran.
 
 For the moment, the company is focussing on the domestic market with no immediate export plans.“Our first priority is to hit the road with conventional products but we are definitely open to electric vehicles at a later date as well,’’ said Balendran.
