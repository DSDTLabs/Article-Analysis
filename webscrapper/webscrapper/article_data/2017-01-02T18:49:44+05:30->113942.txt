NEW DELHI: Hackers suspected to be affiliated with Pakistan attacked the official website of the elite   (NSG) on Sunday, defacing the home page with a profanity laden message against Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as anti-India content. 

 The hackers identified themselves as ‘Alone Injector’. They also left the message “Pakistan Zindabad” on the home page. Officials said the hack was noticed on Sunday morning, and the URL — www.nsg.gov.in — blocked soon after by the counter-terrorism force. 
 
 The hack, official sources said, could have been carried out by Pakistan-affiliated hackers, though they were still trying to ascertain the details. Investigators said they believed that the hackers were based in a third country and working for Pakistan’s spy agency ISI. 
 
 The website is maintained from the NSG headquarters in Manesar and gives out basic information about the force, its origin and operations. Officials said the hack attack had been brought to the notice of the National Informatics Centre (NIC), and “remedial action” was being taken. 
 
 NSG was raised in 1984 as the federal contingency unit to undertake counter-terror and counter-piracy operations. Known as ‘black cat’ commandos, NSG personnel played an important role in neutralising fidayeen in Mumbai during 26/11 and the recent Pathankot attack. 
 
 The force has a unique National Bomb Data Centre which compiles data and analysis of bomb blasts worldwide.
