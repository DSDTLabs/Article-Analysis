NEW DELHI: After over a decade of hounding and humiliation, the   has not found anything against former   captain  , who was dismissed by the government in 2005 for allegedly being involved in the infamous naval war room leak case.

 The CBI submitted its report quietly in a designated court and the Delhi high court late last year, saying “the investigation in respect of petitioner Kashyap Kumar has concluded and the CBI has decided to close the case against him”.
 
 The status report on the CBI probe came on a petition moved by the 58-year-old captain in the HC seeking quashing of FIR against him. Disposing of the petition, Justice   had said in his single page order that the CBI, “on the strength of the relevant documents, has submitted that the case against the petitioner has been closed by the CBI”.
 
 After his name surfaced in the case, Kashyap was dismissed from service in October 2005 without facing a courtmartial — an exercise of the rarely used President’s “pleasure doctrine” under Article 311. He filed a writ petition in November 2005 challenging the decision. He was named in the FIR after CBI took over the probe but the agency did not charge him for want of evidence.
 
 Six people, including Ravi Shankaran, a relative of Navy ex-chief Admiral   and Delhi-based businessman  , were charged by CBI in 2006.
 
 During the probe, CBI examined all the files and questioned some Navy officers regarding the role of Kashyap in the leak but failed to get any convincing answers about his involvement. 
 
 They got a routine reply that Kumar stood dismissed under Section 15 of the Navy Act, an action which has already been challenged in the Delhi HC. 
 
 Kumar was dismissed under the Section 15 of the Navy Act wherein an accused official has no right to present his case or see the allegations that have been levelled against him.
