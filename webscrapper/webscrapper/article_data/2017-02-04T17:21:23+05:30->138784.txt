 is planning to try her hands on small screen and the   says rather than picking up a fiction project, she would like to go for a reality   show. 

  
  
 The 38-year-old actress, who last big screen outing was 2015 film 'Alone,' took a break from films after getting married to TV actor   last year. 
 
 "The fiction is improving but very slowly, we are still catering to a very different kind of audience. The mindsets are changing. Yes, I am open to television but mostly I would think of reality at this point of time. I won't get into fiction right now," said Bipasha.
 
 The actress said she is also planning to return to films and would like to do a comedy project. "I will be back on the big screen soon. Now that marriage is done, honeymoon is done, I would like to do a comedy film." 
 
 The actress walked the ramp wearing a silver encrusted shimmery gown from the collection and says it was her husband Karan, who chose the outfit for her. "I was sent two outfits by the designers and Karan chose this. He said that I was looking like a queen in this gown."
 
 "Karan generally does that. It is nice and easy for me. He helps me then make my mind fast," she said. The designer duo's collection was called 'The Rebel' and was aimed at women who are daring and only desire masterpieces in their wardrobe and was ideal for those Oscar nights in   or award events in the world of  .
