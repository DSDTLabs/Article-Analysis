It's been a while since we saw   on the big screen. The actress was busy hosting popular shows on TV and radio and was last seen in Mammootty film Pathemary, as herself. Nyla will next be working with  , in Anil Radhakrishnan Menon’s latest project  , where she plays a de-glam, yet inspirational character named Effymol.

 Ask Anil about the strange name and he says, “It is inspired by an old American motorcycle brand. However, that doesn’t mean she is riding a motorcycle in the film. Yes, the film does have a connection to racing, but she is not a rider,” he says. “Effymol is a hardworking and inspirational corporation councillor. She isn’t the type who believes in makeup, so Nyla will be given quite a de-glam appearance in the film.”
 
 The director says though the project doesn’t have a hero-heroine formula to it, Effy is one of the prominent characters in it. Also, Kunchacko Boban’s character Sajan Joseph IAS doesn’t have any connection with his character of the same name in the 2003 film Kasthuriman. “He is not even a Thrissurkaaran in this film. We just gave this name as it sounded good,” says Anil. The film’s shoot is currently going on in Thrissur. 
 
  The movie also has Nedumudi Venu, Siddique, Sudheer Karamana, Joy Mathew and Ketaki Narayan as part of the cast.
