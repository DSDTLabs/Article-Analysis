AMRITSAR:   (AIT), which has the experience of handling   hoisted on a 170-ft flagpole, is planning to hire a private contractor to maintain the yet-to-be hoisted tallest national flag on 350-ft flagpole at the Attari border.

 In April 2016, Punjab cabinet minister Anil Joshi had laid the foundation stone of the nation’s tallest national flag at Attari and it was announced that the project would be completed by January 2017.
 
 India’s tallest flag will be another added attraction at   where thousands of tourists visit daily to see the flag lowering ceremony held jointly by troops of Border Security Force (BSF) and Pakistan Rangers.
 
 The proposed flag would be visible from as far as Lahore. Presently, the tallest national flag (293 feet) is hoisted at Ranchi.
 
 “Hoisting national flag is a sensitive issue. The flag often tears with gusty winds, especially when the cloth is wet with overnight dew. So we are thinking of hiring a private contractor for the maintenance of the Tricolour to be hoisted at Attari in the near future,” said AIT chairman  .
 
 He informed that they had a set of five national flags and AIT had now placed order for more flags costing Rs 65,000 each to Flag Foundation of India, which belongs to former Congress MP and industrialist Naveen Jindal.
 
 Intelligence sources informed that in the past Pakistan Rangers had objected to the installation of the tallest Indian national flag on the international border fearing outburst of patriotic sentiments on their side after its news appeared in the media. However, BSF inspector general Mukul Goyal told TOI that they had not received any formal complaint from Pakistan Rangers in this regard.
 
 Amritsar’s 170-ft flagpole is located at Anand Amrit Park. AIT has so far replaced the national flag only five times in 17 months of its installation.
