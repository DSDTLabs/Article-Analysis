 is on an experimental mode. It was only recently she experimented with playing a baddie in Kodi. In her next,  , the actress is all set to perform some intense action sequences, for which she's currently undergoing training. Sundar Balu, the film's director, reveals, 'Whatever you expect a hero to do in a film will be done by Trisha in this film. She will face situations which will eventually push her to get into the action mode. We have roped in fight master Supreme Sundar, who has done phenomenal work for films like   and 10 Endrathukulla, to train Trisha. She plays a western dancer in the film, someone who can't perform stunts. So, we have kept the action sequences intense, but realistic. She will be performing the stunts on her own, without any body double.'

 Sundar also clarifies that the film is not a remake of Anushka Sharma's NH10. 'Ever since we announced this film, there have been reports that this is a remake of NH10. This is a fresh script, which revolves around a bunch of young guys, who torture women. I read a piece about a boy who had a one-sided love affair with a girl. When the girl rejected him, he ended up torturing and sexually abusing her. He captured videos of the horrific incident and sold it to make money. This happened in north India, and this incident served as inspiration for this story,' says  , adding, 'Amit Bhargav, who plays Trisha's boyfriend, is a businessman in the film.'   says, 'We have begun shooting for the film in Karaikudi. Trisha and I are yet to shoot for our portions. But from whatever interactions we've had, she seems like a sweet person. She doesn't have any airs, and is friendly with everyone on the set.'
