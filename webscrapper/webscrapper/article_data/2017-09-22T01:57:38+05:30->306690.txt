Oscar-winning filmmaker   has recently teased the famous   from the sets of his upcoming movie ' : A   Story.'

  He recently posted a photo of the famous Kessel Run with a caption, "Spicey?"
 
  The caption and the Kessel Run might be totally foreign to many, but for 'Star Wars' diehards, the reference is crystal clear.
 
  In the original 'Star Wars',  's Han Solo said, "You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?. It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs." It is referenced again in 'The Force Awakens', when Rey boards the vessel and says, "This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?" To which Han Solo corrects, "Twelve!"
 
  The reference is a deep cut for fair-weathered 'Star Wars' fans, but the hardcore definitely will enjoy it. Howard seems like he wanted to show off his knowledge of the Star Wars mythology and he succeeded.
 
  The movie, which stars Alden Ehrenreich, Donald Glover, Emilia Clarke,  ,  , Phoebe Waller-Bridge and  , is all set to hit the theatres May 25.
