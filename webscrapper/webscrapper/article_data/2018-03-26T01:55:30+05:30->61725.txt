NOIDA: Local MLA Pankaj Singh on Sunday visited the family of   Sah, who was found hanging at her home last week. Ekisha’s family members threatened to intensify their protest if the principal of the school where she studied and the teachers accused of driving her to suicide were not arrested at the earliest.

 “I don’t know about the progress of the investigation. I agree my daughter was an average student. But in her class, some students were below-average. My daughter was deliberately graded poorly and made to fail in science and social science papers,” said Raghav Sah, Ekisha’s father, on Sunday. He said he would continue to seek a   probe.
 
 In an interaction with journalists, MLA Singh appealed to the school management to be more sensitive towards students’ welfare. “The kind of allegations the family has made are quite serious. Had the school management been more sensitive, and the parents informed about her academic performance time to time, this incident could have been averted,” Singh said.
 
 The management of  , where Ekisha studied, has denied any role in driving her to suicide.
 
 Singh also urged the police to ensure a fair and fast probe.
 
 Some members of FONRWA, the residents’ association, also visited the family and assured all help. Noida police officers said they were investigating the case from multiple angles but were yet to get any concrete leads.
