NEW DELHI: The news of BJP’s IT cell chief   being invited to address the   at   has not gone down well with students. The JNU administration reworked the schedule and dropped Gupta’s name at the last moment fearing protest, students claim.

 Students were against the invitation claiming that Gupta has been engaged in targeted online campaign against political opponents that includes abuse of women.
 
 Calling online trolls an “organised mafia that plans its targets and abuses the person” Mohit Pandey, JNUSU president said these campaigns are carried out under the command of Gupta, and JNU students bore its brunt, especially after February 9 incident last year. “After destroying the country through demonetisation, they are trying to digitise the economy. For that they are inviting a man who was instrumental in painting Kanhaiya as an anti-national and whose troll army ran a campaign where they claimed that Najeeb had joined ISIS,” Pandey said.
 
 In a series of cautionary notices, students have been warned by the JNU administration not to hold any protests, failing which action would be taken. Meanwhile, JNUSU has called for a two-day strike on January 12 and 13 against the UGC gazette notification, suspension of students and for the protection of ‘JNU culture’.
