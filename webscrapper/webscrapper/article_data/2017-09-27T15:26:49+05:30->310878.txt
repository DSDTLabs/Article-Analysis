KASARAGOD: A Kerala man's car craze recently cost him big bucks.

 Ansar, a   resident, had to cough up Rs 8 lakh as penalty on his luxury car, when the authorities realised that the vehicle had remained unregistered for eight months.
 
 Ansar, who owns a supermarket in Abu Dhabi, bought a Rs 60 lakh   car eight months ago, but refused to get it registered till he got his preferred sequence of numbers - KL 14-V1.
 
 In fact, he went on to pay a whopping Rs 1.05 lakh for the number.
 
 But even after he had his choice of registration number, he dilly-dallyed in completing the registration formalities.
 
 Eventually, the town circle inspector caught up with him and made him cough up Rs 8 lakh as penalty.
