NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday demanded full statehood status for Delhi for better governance. “Delhi has become a state but what kind of a state is it? Law and order, many other subjects are with the Centre. Every day, obstacles crop up. Such a state holds no meaning,” said the Janata Dal (United) president at an election rally in Burari.

 “We will fight for full statehood to Delhi,” said Kumar while urging Delhiites to vote for JD(U) candidates in the municipal elections. AAP, which once shared friendly ties with JD(U), also has a similar demand. 
 
 For the first time, JD(U) is contesting 101 of the 272 seats, banking on the Poorvanchali migrants who make up around 30-35% population of Delhi. Though Delhi cannot run without Biharis, they are yet to get proper representation, Kumar said. 
 
 A large number of women who turned up at the rally cheered Kumar as he spoke about the “success” of liquor ban in Bihar. “Since it went dry, Bihar has witnessed 21% drop in murder, 23% in dacoity, 41% in kidnapping, 26% in rioting and 12% in violence against women. The number of road accidents has also come down.” 
 
 Though the Bihar government has lost a huge revenue, “the prohibition has given people a better life. Other sales have ensured that there is no drop in the total revenue collection”. Calling for a similar move in Delhi, he said, “Study the Bihar model and implement it. Liquor should be banned everywhere, including Delhi.” 
 
 A 4km road show went through several colonies where the civic infrastructure lies in a mess. Comparing Delhi’s unauthorised colonies and JJ clusters to Bihar’s villages, he said, “Bihar’s villages are better than many unauthorised colonies of Delhi.” 
 
 Without naming PM Narendra Modi or any other party, Kumar said, “Smart cities are being made. (They) should also make Delhi a smart city.”
