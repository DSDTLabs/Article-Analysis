Hyderabad: Stating that courts should not ordinarily stay the process of arrests, the   on Wednesday said that if a stay is imposed on the   in a case, the judge should state the reasons clearly. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Shameem Akther said this while setting aside the ‘stay of arrest’ order of a single judge in a criminal case filed by one   of Moosapet in Hyderabad. She filed the complaint against one A Chandana charging her with cheating them with false promises of high returns on their investments in the demat accounts opened at the behest of Chandana. 

 Following a petition filed by Chandana urging the court to quash the FIR against her, a single judge had earlier stayed her arrest and allowed the police to continue their investigation. Aggrieved by this, Swarnalatha challenged the relief given to Chandana.
 
 Chandana’s counsel Vijaysen Reddy questioned the action of the police in referring every matter to the central crime station in Hyderabad. The police have been summoning Chandana and she had been extending her cooperation and there was no need to effect arrest at this stage, he said.
 
 The bench said the matter was at the discretion of police. They could call her under section 41-A of the CrPC and take further steps in accordance with law, it said. But giving directions to the police at the stage of investigation would amount to interference in their probe, the bench said. “We will verify the legality of their actions if they take any action, but not before they take any action”, the bench said.
