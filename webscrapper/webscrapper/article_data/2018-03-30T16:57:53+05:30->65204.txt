 The company said that Scott 'advised' the promoter that "despite his contractual obligations, he refused to show up for the event." 
 
 "As a result of this breach, ( ) suffered significant damages including the sums paid to XX Global (the legal agent and representative of Scott) and (Scott) and their booking agent, the sums paid to arrange Webster's travel, the sum's paid to advertise the event, lease the venue and hire staff, and the lost profits (PJAM) would have realised on this event," the company said. 
 
 The company also claimed that Scott's agent was paid a USD 10,000 booking fee and had scheduled a private jet to fly the rapper to the venue. 
 
 The company is seeking their USD 150,000 back from Scott, as well as attorney's fees, pre-judgment interest and alleged 'reputational damages' the company claims to have suffered as a result of his cancellation.
