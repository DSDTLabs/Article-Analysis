GURUGRAM: Power transmission company Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (HVPNL) has filed a police complaint against   for allegedly damaging its cables while the corporation was undertaking digging work to lay water pipelines. According to  , the damage took place on May 18, affecting supply from its 66kV   in Sector 4.

 An HVPNL official told TOI they incurred losses to the tune of Rs 20 lakh owing to the digging. “The line generally moves in two circuits. Each circuit has four cables. MCG damaged only two of them, so we were able to restore the system quickly. Had one more cable been damaged, we’d have suffered a major breakdown, directly affecting 50,000 subscribers,” a HVPNL official said.
 
 Officials said the cables were damaged one after another. “They damaged one cable on May 18. Another one was damaged the next day,” the official said. “We filed a police complaint on May 18 itself, on the basis of which an FIR was registered the same day against MCG at Sector 4 police station. We haven’t discussed the matter with MCG yet, but we registered the complaint so that such incidents don’t happen again.”
 
 As a result of the damage, power supply was disrupted for about five hours in Sector 4 and adjacent areas. 
 
 TOI tried to contact several MCG officials, none of whom could immediately comment on the issue. MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav said he was unaware of the issue. “I’ve no idea about this. I’ll get it checked,” he said.
