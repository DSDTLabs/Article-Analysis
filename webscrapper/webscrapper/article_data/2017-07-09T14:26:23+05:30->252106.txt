Singer   said she is not a fan of dieting but tries to opt for an overall healthy eating regime. 

  
  
 The 28-year-old diva reveals she did try to restrict her calorie intake once but it was "awful". "I've never been that person who's into dieting, because I can't sustain it. I did a diet once and it was awful and made me miserable - I would never do it again."
 
 "I'm a fan of eating what you want as long as it's good for you and you know where it's from. I'm really into organic and healthy food, but I've never believed in eating no carbs or no fat," she said. Humes said she does not like to work out either as it's not an easy task for her. 
 
 "I train and work out in between nap times and I've got a trainer who pushes me - there's no way I could do it without him. He's really nice but he doesn't take any prisoners. I tried to cancel yesterday, because it was too hot and he wouldn't let me. I really hated him for it."
