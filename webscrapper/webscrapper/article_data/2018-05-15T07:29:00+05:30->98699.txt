Amritsar: Citing the issue of Kailash Mansarovar Yatra that the Government of India had taken up with the Chinese government and brought it to a logical end, the Sangat Langah Kartarpur (SLK), a Sikh body spearheading the drive for Kartarpur Sahib corridor for the past 17 years, has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take up the corridor issue with the Pakistan government.

 SLK members, who visited Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district on Monday to offer prayers while looking towards Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Narowal district of Pakistan, handed over a memorandum to the district administration addressed to the PM.
 
 SLK president B S Goraya said they had urged Modi to give due respect to the religious sentiments of Sikhs and take up the issue of the corridor with Pakistan government on the lines of Kailash Mansarovar Yatra issue that he had taken up previously with the Chinese government.
 
 “We wish Modi to fulfil the heartfelt desire of having a corridor between Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Narowal district of Pakistan, a distance of about 4 kms, before 550th anniversary of the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev,” he said.
 
 He wondered that despite passing of resolution by Punjab assembly in favour of a corridor in October 2010, no further action had been taken by the state government.
 
 In the past, Pakistan’s former president General Pervez Musharraf had given a verbal offer to the Indian Sikhs to visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib from Dera Baba Nanak without a passport and visa. However, Pakistan has not submitted any formal proposal on the same with the Indian government till date.
 
 Bhajan Singh, a member of SLK, said making of a corridor ahead of the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak would be the most sought after gift of the Modi government to the Sikh diaspora.
