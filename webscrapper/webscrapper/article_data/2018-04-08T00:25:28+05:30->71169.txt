Tirunelveli: Cricket enthusiasts were left disappointed after the screening of the IPL inaugural match on a giant screen here had to be cancelled following “some technical issues”. Sources said that the next match would not also be screened owing to the same reason. The 11th edition of the T-twenty cricket carnival was scheduled to be shown on a giant screen at the exhibition grounds in the city on Saturday as part of the ‘Vivo IPL Fan Park’. Fans were counting down the hours to the opening match between Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians when the organisers declared that match would not be screened at the last minute. While the organizers could not be reached for further comments, the city police claimed that the event was dropped abruptly due to technical snag in relaying it. However, sources said that the cancellation could be due to the threat messages circulated on the social media that the LED screen will be damaged if the matches were screened. The messages were taken seriously as a few political outfits have issued a threat to disrupt IPL matches in the state to show their discontent at the centre for not forming the Cauvery Management Board. The fans had to return home disappointed after some fans, unaware of the turn of event, went to the exhibition ground hoping to watch their favourite team’s match live on the giant screen. tnn
