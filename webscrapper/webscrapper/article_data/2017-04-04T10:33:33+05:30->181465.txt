New Delhi: Upset with ticket distribution, several BJP councillors and workers have decided to join the poll battle as Independent candidates. 

 Nawada councillor Kishan Gehlot, who had won in last year’s bypolls, is one of them. Gehlot had requested senior leaders to make an exception for last year’s winners but the party stuck to its decision of not fielding any sitting councillor. 
 
 Several other councillors, including Sandhya Verma (Patparganj), Nikki Singh (New Ashok Nagar), Poonam Sharma (Ashok Vihar) and Surinder Kaur Shunty ( ), are also in the fray as Independent candidates. “We didn’t like the way the party treated us. The party has labelled all of us corrupt. They could have denied tickets to those councillors against whom they had negative reports. But punishing all councillors is not correct. Now the public will tell the truth,” said Singh.
 
 Anticipating a rebellion,   chief   had promised a select few better positions in the party structure. He had selected ‘Special 26’, a group of councillors who have performed well. Several workers and office-bearers have also decided to fight the polls as Independents. Shailender Pandey, general secretary of the Poorvanchal wing, has already distributed pamphlets with a list of 21 promises in Chawwla. Malti Verma, a former councillor who was denied ticket last time too, is going to contest from Naraina.
 
 “Wives of so many party workers have been given tickets and ward jumping has also been allowed. The party is breaking its own rules,” said a worker.
