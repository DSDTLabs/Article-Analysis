HYDERABAD:   (TJAC) chairman   on Tuesday asserted that the rally and public meeting highlighting the unemployment problem in the state would be held as planned on Wednesday. This he said despite the police rejecting permission for the rally and a meeting at Dharna Chowk near Indira Park.

 The TJAC chairman rejected the proposal to postpone the rally to Sunday on February 26 due to Maha Shivaratri that precedes the date. He called upon the students and JAC leaders to continue their protest peacefully if they are arrested by police to prevent them from reaching the city.
 
 Speaking to reporters on Tuesday , Kodandaram flayed both the state government and the police depart ment for launching `smear campaign' against JAC leaders individually and generally about the rally.
 
 “Protest is the fundamental right of the people in a democracy and we won't give it up. The police have already arrested over 600 people since Monday evening.We expect that the arrests will gather pace and conti nue till tomorrow to prevent us from holding the rally and meeting for the just demands of unemployed youth,“ Kodandaram said.
 
 He faulted the police department for giving a report to the state government and high court expressing apprehension that frontal organizations of left wing groups might infiltrate rally.
