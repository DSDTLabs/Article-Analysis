CHANDIGARH: At a time when a large number of students in government   in   cannot even read English, the state government is planning to introduce Mandarin, one of the most common Chinese languages, as an optional language in a section of schools to prepare a platform for students to effectively compete in the global market.

 Talking to mediapersons on Tuesday, chief minister   said the language would have an extremely important role to play globally in the future. He said several institutes in Doaba region were even now teaching Italian and other foreign languages.
 
 When the proposal was first announced in the Punjab assembly last month, the opposition parties had alleged that the state was unable to implement Punjabi as the first language, but was keen on Mandarin, one of the most common Chinese languages.
 
 Sources in the education department said the state board would finalise the course with the help of the department of Chinese and Tibetan studies at Panjab University in the coming weeks. There are plans to introduce the language in one school in every district.
 
 The Doaba region of Punjab has many youths who aspire to go abroad and many families already have several members settled in Canada and European countries.
 
 Therefore, he said, there was a need to impart foreign language training to students to enable them to compete effectively in the global market.
 
 Mandarin was earlier offered in 22 schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in different states, but the programme was stopped in 2016.
 
 The 2017 annual status of education report-rural (ASER), brought out by NGO Pratham, had revealed that nearly 27% rural students in the age group of 14-18 years in two districts of Punjab — 34% students in Amritsar and 21% in Bathinda — cannot do basic arithmetic tasks, while 21% cannot read an English sentence.
