JAIPUR: Exiled Bangladeshi writer  , who participated in a session at the JLF on Monday, faced the ire of   who protested outside the   venue.

 Representatives of various organisations met the organisers of JLF and demanded that they should not invite ‘controversial’ writers such as Nasrin and   in future.
 
 At a closed door meeting, organiser Sanjoy K Roy has apparently assured them that they would be careful from next year.
 
 Nasrin showed up at JLF on Sunday, raising speculation that she may address a session on ‘Exile’ listed on Monday at 3.45pm at the Front Lawn venue.
 
 Since the picture of Nasrin was carried by some newspapers, Muslim groups held a meeting at Muslim Musafirkhana early in the day to demand the cancellation of the event.
 
 While they were at the commissioner’s office in Jaipur to submit the memorandum, the JLF team, sensing trouble, rescheduled the session to 12.30pm, three hours earlier than was originally scheduled, amid tight security.
 
 As the news spread, representatives belonging to different socio-religious groups and political parties raised slogans and held a protest right outside the venue. Though the police did intervene, the protesters refused to back out.
 
 Roy then invited them for a dialogue, which lasted for about 45 minutes. But he failed to convince them despite offering them a session next year on ‘why Taslima Nasrin and Salman Rushdie should not be called for the lit fest’. However, the groups were adamant and sought assurance on not inviting these two writers ever to the fest. They were later told that their sentiments would be considered while planning the sessions in future.
