The 50-minute documentary depicting world’s longest strike by 2.50 lakh textile workers between 1982-83 in Mumbai was handed over to Prakash Magdum, director NFAI for its preservation under Kiran Dhiwar, film preservation officer, NFAI.  “I am very happy to submit the film to NFAI for preservation a day after International Labour Day. This film is my tribute to all the workers of the world. The subject was very close to my heart and I have tried to depict the struggle of textile mill workers who took part in the struggle,” said Dixit, a Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) alumnus. The film was one of the earliest crowd funded documentaries in the country with contribution in cash and kind from renowned personalities like Naseeruddin Shah, Nana Patekar, Govind Nihlani, Shreeram Lagu and organizations like Max Muller Bhavan, Mumbai along with several other citizens. Technicians like late Debu Deodhar, Harish Bhimani worked for the film without remuneration.  It was screened as a curtain raiser in the first documentary and short film festival organized by Films Division in 1990. “The film is an important documentation of one of the historical events in India’s labour movement. We are thankful to Dixit for submitting the documentary to NFAI for preservation,” said Magdum. Apart from actual footage of the strike, the film contains recitation by renowned Marathi poet Narayan Surve. Another highlight of the film are interviews with veteran leaders S A Dange and Ahilya Rangnekar.
