JAIPUR: A 20-year-old man working as washer man and 28-year-old working as domestic help were arrested by   circle police station on Wednesday for allegedly asking a ransom of Rs 10 lakh from a city’s prestigious oncologist. Both had claimed to be the goons of underworld Don   and had sent audio message to the said doctor asking him to pay Rs 10 lakh else his whole family would be killed. 

 Police said that the doctor (police wished not to be named) works at a leading cancer hospital in the city. He had lodged an FIR some days ago in which he stated that he got a audio and text message on his mobile phone in which the caller demanded the said money. 
 
 “Based on the FIR and the sim no given by the complainant the call detail record of the number was taken on record. Thereafter it was found that the sim card was issued on the name of one Vishal Meena who told us that his friend Shubham(20) had purchased the simcard from him. Shubham was interrogated and he confessed that he has committed the crime along with his friend   Ganeshani(40),” said Kunwar Rastradeep, deputy commissioner of police on Wednesday. 
 
 Shubham works as washerman very close to the house of the doctor while Dilip works as domestic help in the same locality. “Both thought that doctor was well off and if they will add the name of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim their threat would be taken seriously,” Rastradeep added. 
 
 Police said that both had a motive to live a lavish life. “The number from which they had sent the messages to the doctor had the profile picture of Dawood Ibrahim to make it genuine. Also they had used the simcard which was not been used earlier,” he added.
