ALWAR: The delay in announcing the name of party candidate from Alwar   seat for the ruling   is leading to confusion and ambition among party leaders.

  minister in the Raje ministry   had already stated campaign in the constituency hoping to get the party ticket, while another leader, a former party district president   has also joined the fray. He had obtained a nomination paper from the election office on Friday. So far 28 people have purchased nomination papers.
 
 The delay in announcing the candidate has quired the pitch as party leaders seems to take it as a signal from the BJP high command of no consensus on any candidate. Sanjay Sharma hopes that if the party decides to field a non-Yadav from the seat, it could be his turn. The   had already announced a former MLA from Behror Dr Karan Singh Yadav as the party nominee and is well ahead in campaign in the by poll on January 29. The last date of filing nomination is January 10.
 
 BJP district president Pandit Dharamveer Sharma however denied any internal fight within the party said “so far none of them filed nominations. Anybody can obtain a nomination paper but when the party announces its official candidate, he will only file the nomination paper,” he said.
