The new trauma and emergency building at   would be fully functional from March 15, said Bhopal divisional commissioner Ajatshatru Shrivastava on Sunday. He visited the new facility that is expected to improve emergency care at the premier government hospital.

 Hamidia is one of the associated hospitals of   (GMC) wherein expansion and redevelopment of the campus has been underway on a massive scale for the last one year. The new OPD wing is located at the entrance of the hospital.
 
 Nearly 10% of all the cases referred to the tertiary care hospital are related to trauma and emergency. The facility would provide for 24x7 specialists and diagnostics facility.
 
 While some OPDs along with trauma and emergency care have become operational, the new block would be merged with existing hospital in the next three weeks. Three operational theatres, two modular and one septic OT, would commence operations by mid-March. The functional separation of septic OT will cater to surgical procedures in order to maintain high levels of hygiene and avoid incidence of skin and soft tissue infections. Chief minister   is expected to inaugurate the facility.
 
 Hospital administration is also anticipating the possibility of the start of MRI and CT scan diagnostics in March. Radio diagnostics would be on PPP mode with state government bearing the cost of interventions for BPL and similar patients.
 
 Sources said that the government owned   (HLL) may also be given the contract for maintenance and non-clinical operations for services in the new OPD block. HLL has been entrusted with a multi-crore contract for providing housekeeping and security services to the medical hospital.
