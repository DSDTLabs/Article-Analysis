HYDERABAD: A tragedy unfolded at   after two 15-yearold girl students,   and  , of an upscale LB Nagar school were found lying in a pool of blood in the premises. They had jumped off the eight floor of the building. Police found a suicide note allegedly written by Sawani Kale, in Bhargavi Patel’s flat. In the note, Sawani said, “I am sorry mother for not being a strong daughter. She did not mention reasons for suicide,” the inspector said.

  
  
 
 Both students had appeared for the Hindi language examination that was conducted on March 6 and were preparing for their communicative English and English language and literature examination, scheduled for March 12.
 
 While Patel’s father Kanthi Patel runs a door manufacturing company, Kale’s father is a scientist with the Defence Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL).
 
 Family members of both girls told police they were ‘good’ in academics. Police registered a case of suspicious death under Section 174 of CrPC. The bodies have been shifted for autopsy. Police said possible reasons behind the suicide pact will be explored, including academic pressure.
 
 City child psychologists and psychiatrists point to a spurt in number of such suicides among schoolchildren, with parental and peer pressure being primary reasons.
 
 Shekar Reddy, psychiatrist at KIMS hospitals in   urged school authorities to ensure presence of a counsellor, on campus to prevent such tragedies.
 
 “Nowadays, in a highly performance-driven academic climate, there is too much pressure on children, both by parents and school authorities, to achieve higher grades. Due to this reason, many school-going kids suffer depression that may tend to trigger suicidal tendencies as well. Parents along with school staff must ensure that a counsellor or child psychologist is present at every school in the city to identify vulnerable children and refer them to psychiatrists,” said Dr Reddy.
