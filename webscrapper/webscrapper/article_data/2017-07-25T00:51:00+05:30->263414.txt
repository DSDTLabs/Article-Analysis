Mangaluru: Rationalist Narendra Nayak has slammed Shalini Rajneesh, principal secretary, state health department, for her Facebook post endorsing consumption of jaggery and onion as a nature remedy for dengue. 

 The IAS officer on Monday shared a picture of jaggery and onion along with a message – “Remedy for Dengu fever – Share to spread awareness”.
 
 The post in Kannada also appeals to readers to share the information. “It is easy to follow, no side effects and available everywhere. Nothing to lose. Those who are affected by dengue should take jaggery along with small raw onion for cure. The platelet count reduces in dengue patients. This medicine helps in increasing the platelet count and increases resistance thereby curing dengue. It is truly an effective medicine for this type of fever,” reads the message shared by Shalini. 
 
 Responding to Shalini’s FB post, Narendra Nayak, president, Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations, sent mails to the media questioning the credibility of her claims. “Is this cure endorsed by the health department and administered as treatment in government hospitals? If this really works and there is evidence for the same, then it should be used as the standard protocol for all dengue patients. If it is not so, then she should retract it and give a statement to that effect,” Nayak said. 
 
 While it may be harmless to eat small raw onions and jaggery, for some people it may be dangerous when they choose to follow this and not take proper treatment for dengue, Nayak warned. 
 
 “I think this point should be clarified. While such statements by lay people and quacks can be dismissed, coming from a highly-placed and educated IAS officer of the health department tends to lend some credibility to it,” Nayak said. 
 
 Shalini was not available for comment.
