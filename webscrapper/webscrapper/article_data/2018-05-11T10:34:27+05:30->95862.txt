NEW DELHI: The   for most wickets in   remains with  , but barely, after   matched him on 16 wickets with another two-wicket haul in Mumbai Indians’ third win in a row. 

 
 
 
 
 Pandya had lost the Purple Cap to Tye on Wednesday after the Australian pacer had taken four wickets in Kings XI Punjab’s loss to Rajasthan Royals, but his 2/16 in the defending champions’ crushing win over Kolkata Knight Riders on Thursday has seen him draw level with Tye on 16 wickets. 
 
 Behind Tye and Pandya are KXIP’s teenaged Afghanistan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rehman, MI spinner Mayank Markande and Royal Challengers Bangalore’s Umesh Yadav, all on 14 wickets. The Sunrisers Hyderabad pair of Siddarth Kaul and Rashid Khan each have 13 wickets, and with their franchise playing Delhi Daredevils in today’s IPL 2018 fixture, both stand to gain on the bowling leaderboard. 
 
 In the batting table, KXIP opener   retains the   for most runs (471) but Mumbai opener Suryakumar Yadav has gained ground on him following his 36 against KKR yesterday. Suryakumar has 435 runs, and the other two batsmen with over 400 for the season are Ambati Rayudu (423) and SRH skipper Kane Williamson (410). Given Williamson’s form in IPL 2018, he also looks likely to move up the batting charts towards the Orange Cap during today’s SRH v DD game, as does Rishabh Pant who has 393 runs at a superb strike-rate of 173.12.
