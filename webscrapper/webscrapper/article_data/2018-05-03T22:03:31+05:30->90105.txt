BENGALURU/ HUBBALI: A day after Prime Minister   heaped praise on him, JD(S) supremo H D   on Wednesday returned the compliment, saying his continuation as   member was only due to Modi’s persuasion skills. 

 
 
 
 
 However, he was quick to add that the new-found mutual bonhomie was not indicative of any alliance between JD(S) and BJP, in the event of a hung assembly. “Before the 2014 elections, I had said I would resign my Lok Sabha membership if   gets a majority on its own. I decided to resign, but Modi persuaded me against doing so. He said the country needs the experience and services of senior leaders,” Gowda said. 
 
 Gowda said the PM is a smart politician. “Modi is aware about the happenings in   politics, and also what   said about me. In this background, he must have praised me out of respect. What he said is true, but that doesn’t mean I don’t have any differences with him,” Gowda said. 
 
 
 
 
 
 “I’ve met him four or five times, asking him to address farmers’ problems, including the Mahadayi issue. He listens, but does nothing. I was hoping he would speak about Mahadayi at least during the campaign, but he didn’t,” Gowda added. Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah described Modi’s remark about Gowda as a political statement which clearly showed a “tacit understanding” between BJP and JD(S). 
 
 “BJP leaders do not criticise JD(S) leaders and vice versa,” he said in Hubbali. But Gowda chose to keep the suspense alive over his party’s role in the event of a fractured verdict, by reiterating that his party would get a majority. He also dismissed pre-poll surveys which predicted a hung assembly. 
 
 
 
 
 “I don’t believe these surveys,” he added. “Yeddyurappa was involved in corruption and fell prey to the Lokayukta probe. But Siddaramaiah virtually closed the Lokayukta and created the Anti-Corruption Bureau, which acts at the behest of the government,” he said.
