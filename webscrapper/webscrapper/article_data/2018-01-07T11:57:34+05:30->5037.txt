DEHRADUN: Some citizens here came together to form Waste Action Collective (WAC), an initiative to curb the use of plastic among residents of Dehradun. WAC convinces people to take up small challenges, which change every four days and include not using plastic bags, bottles and other similar items. Participants can post their progress on social media portals of the group. The drive, called “no plastic month”, started on January 1 and will continue till the end of the month.

  Soumya Prasad, who founded the group and worked previously as a professor at   (JNU), told TOI, “As a scientist, I have researched on how plastic harms humans and animals but instead of doing just that, I wanted to make people aware of the issue. Authorities ban the use of plastic, but it doesn’t work until residents are told exactly why plastic is harmful. Instead of a New Year resolution, we have started a 30-days-without-plastic challenge so the participants realise that it is possible. Every four days, we post micro challenges, like going four days without using plastic bags or bottles or even straws.”
 
   , one of those who took up the “no plastic month” challenge, said, “I have been avoiding the use of plastic for quite some time but this initiative makes us do it more consciously. Also, we don’t just keep it to ourselves but pass the idea on to others. It definitely makes things more interesting.”
 
  Asked if he planned on any similar initiatives in the future, Prasad said, “Currently we are focusing on getting Dehradun cleaner and are extensively using social media to convey the message. We are in the process of making videos to help people understand how we can go plastic free and have a cleaner environment in general.”
