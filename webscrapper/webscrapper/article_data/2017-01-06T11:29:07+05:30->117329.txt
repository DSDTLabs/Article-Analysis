PUNE: The continuous grilling of the four suspects arrested for allegedly vandalizing noted playwright  's bust at   has failed to yield any results. 

 So far, the suspects have maintained that they committed the crime on their own, police said. "However, we would continue the interrogation to trace any 'mastermind' behind the crime. Though, till now, there seems to be none," police added.
 
 The Deccan Gymkhana police have arrested four youths, identified as Pradeep Kanse (25), Harshavardhan Magdum (23), Swapnil Kale (24) and Ganesh Karale (26), for their connection in the crime.
 
 Ajay Kadam, senior police inspector of the Deccan Gymkhana police, said the officers are continuously grilling the suspects. "The suspects, who are educated and belong to good families, have told us that they committed the act out of love for Sambhaji Maharaj. They were only inspired by a speech made by a political leader at Tulapur, off Pune-Ahmednagar highway, in January 2016," he said.
 
 Police have also seized an SUV allegedly used in the crime. "The hammer and axe used in the crime are yet to be recovered," Kadam said.
 
  
 
 
 Ajit Pawar, former deputy chief minister, has said the Maratha community does not support the destructive acts such as damaging the bust of Ram Ganesh Gadkari. "The people who have done it do not represent the Maratha community. We don't support people like these. The mastermind behind this act should be taken to task," Pawar said.
 
 He said PMC has decided to reinstall the bust. "PMC members have been elected by the people and their decision should be considered as those of the people. It should be respected," Pawar said.
