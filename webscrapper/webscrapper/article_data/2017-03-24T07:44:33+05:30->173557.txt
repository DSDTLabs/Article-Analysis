ITANAGAR: A nine-day mega cultural event, Rashtriya Sanskriti Mahotsava , showcasing traditional folk dance and music was inaugurated in   by   Chief Minister Pema Khandu today. 

 "It is a matter of pride for Tawang and Arunachal Pradesh that a big cultural event is being held here. Despite repeated claims by a neighbouring country, Arunachal Pradesh is more Indian than any other part of the country," he said. 
 
 About 100 artists representing different tribes of Arunachal Pradesh and 500 artists from across the country will showcase their traditional folk dance and music at the cultural extravaganza, organised by the Union Ministry of Culture. 
 
  Khandu thanked and appreciated Union Minister of State for Tourism & Culture,  's leadership for organising the event in the state despite the issues of communication bottleneck and the region being a border state. 
 
 The chief minister said that Arunachal Pradesh being land to more than 26 tribes and 100 sub tribes with diversity of culture expanding from Tawang to Longding is the best place to host such a mega cultural event. 
 
  In his message to the people, Khandu appealed to the youths to preserve their cultural identity and be the agent to carry forward the ancient culture to next generation. 
 
  He lauded senior members of the tribal community to have preserved and promoted the ancient culture and tradition. 
 
  Also acknowledging the need for society to embrace modernity and development, the chief minister urged the people not to leave behind their culture in pursuit of it. 
 
  Lamenting that the department of art and culture had been neglected in past, Khandu said his government will give due importance to it. 
 
  He said that to bring back life to the department, a performing leader like Art & Culture Minister   has been entrusted with the job. 
 
  The chief minister said a regional cultural centre of the North East Zonal Cultural Centre (NEZCC) will soon be established at Itanagar.
