MUMBAI:   have now become firm favourites to clinch the Inter-Zonal Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament being played here. On Thursday, they defeated North Zone by eight wickets to stake a solid claim to win the tournament. 

 Having won the toss, East Zone skipper   chose to field first. And despite the absence of his frontline bowlers, Ashok Dinda and  , Tiwary backed his reserve bowlers to get the job done for his team. North Zone, who were virtually out of contention despite having heavy weights such as Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh, Ashish Nehra, Shikhar Dhawan and Gautam Gambhir, failed to leave an impression in the tournament.
 
 Dhawan (20) and Gambhir (20) got starts but were soon back in the pavilion. Unmukt Chand (20) who came in for Rishabh Pant (on India A duty v Australia) got a start but squandered the opportunity. Yuvraj Singh stroked his way to an attractive 38 as North Zone posted a modest 159-9.
 
 East Zone started their chase on a disastrous note, giving North Zone some hope of staging a fightback. But 19-year-old Jharkhand lad   and skipper Manoj Tiwary put on a 149-run partnership to see the team through. Singh made a classy unbeaten 74 off 48 balls, while Tiwary remained unbeaten on a 43-ball 75.
