GREATER NOIDA: Three miscreants barged into a   showroom in Jagat Farm market in Greater Noida and tried to loot cash of around Rs 1,83,500 after assaulting the   and a customer present at the showroom on Tuesday afternoon.

 The assailants, captured on CCTV, hit the service engineer, Love Kumar, on his head with the butt of a pistol when he intervened.
 
 The brazenness of the robbery attempt came across from the fact that none of three were masked and and chose to commit their crime at 12:21pm. Two of them were armed with pistols.
 
 A grab of the CCTV cameras installed in the showroom accessed by TOI shows the three men entering the shop. One of them forcefully grabs a middle-aged woman customer by her neck while the second one hits the engineer on his head with the pistol butt. Simultaneously, the third miscreant tries to flee with the cash when the engineer grabs his hand.
 
 “It all happened within 10 seconds. They entered the showroom peacefully but held the customer by her hair and neck. One of them tried to flee with the cash and when I tried to stop, the third one attacked me and fired in the air,” Love Kumar told TOI.
