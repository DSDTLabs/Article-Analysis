ARARIA: Chief minister   on Wednesday made a veiled attack on RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his family and said they misused power to amass properties. 

 Addressing an election meeting at Raniganj and Sikti in support of BJP candidate   in Araria parliamentary byelection scheduled for Sunday,   said: “Whosoever commits sin will have to face its consequences in this life itself. People had voted them (RJD) to power not to amass huge wealth but to serve the people and develop the state. In public life, amassing wealth should not be the principal agenda, rather receiving social prestige and honour by doing service to the people should be the given priority.”
 
 Nitish was accompanied by deputy CM   and a number of NDA leaders. The CM said the opposition leaders did not have any genuine fact or convincing logic to seek votes. He reiterated that a corporation would be formed soon to finance various schemes related to students of the state. 
 
 Modi said the BJP-JD(U) combine would change the equations and their candidate would win hands down. He also spoke in favour of reservation in jobs and claimed it should never be removed. 
 
 Modi also attacked Lalu on corruption charges. “He (Lalu) has gone to jail six times while a young man of 28 years (Lalu’s younger son  ) has become the owner of properties worth over Rs1,000 crore in no time. Service to people and development of the state, and not amassing wealth, should be the prime agenda of politics,” he said and urged the audience to vote for BJP for all-round development of the state.
 
 RJD and BJP have made Araria seat a prestige issue and making all efforts to woo the voters. MLAs, state ministers, Purnia MP and several other local BJP and JD(U) leaders also addressed the gathering.
