Anant Purav is no ordinary runner. Two   in the heart and a severe   injury have not deterred him from running innumerable full marathons and an uphill Comrades   of 87km in South Africa that stretches across as many as five hills.

 Purav, who supplies accessories to the garments industry from his Dadar office, began to run at the age of 50 in 2012. His running came to a sudden halt, though, when he felt an ache in his heart one morning. An angiography revealed two blockages and the doctors recommended angioplasty. “But I got an FSR test done which revealed that I had two blockages—70% and 76%. The doctors asked me to stop running. All I could do was walk for 30 minutes. I heeded to the doctor’s advice for a while but I could not stop myself from running,” he told TOI. Soon, he readied himself for the Hyderabad full marathon, then he did Delhi and Goa too. A year later, his spine gave up on him. After a spine surgery, the doctors “told me that I am finished—no cycling, biking or running would be permitted,” he said.
 
 Yet, he did a few full marathons in Mumbai and Bengaluru. “I then wanted to take up the ultimate running challenge. So I decided to go for the Comrades marathon.” Last year, along with him, 80 runners from India signed up for it; 56 of them finished in 12 hours, the maximum stipulated time. At 56 now, Purav will pace 42km at Mumbai Marathon and aims to finish it within five hours.
