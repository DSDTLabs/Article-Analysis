KANPUR: Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) and   (TCS) have come together to set up world class educational and research ecosystem for   (ICME) at the institute's campus. 

 The ecosystem will be inaugurated on Thursday. Director, IIT-K, Prof Indranil Manna and vice-president and chief technology officer of Tata Consultancy Services, K   will address the function.
 
 ICME is an emerging discipline that has huge potential in materials development by integrating a number of disciplines to cut down on the time and cost required in development and manufacturing. In other words, ICME is useful for accelerating the time required in the development of materials and of the products. For example, a car which would otherwise require 10 years to be developed, can be done so in a much shorter time period using ICME, said a faculty in IIT-K.
 
 The setting up of the   was decided upon as part of the MoU between IIT-K and TCS which was signed in November 2015 with the aim of carrying out cutting edge research on ICME-based materials and technology that are of national importance.
 
 Laborations will also be a key focus area. IIT-Madras, IISc Bangalore, IIT-Bombay, DRDO, National Metallurgical Laboratory, Georgia Tech and Purdue are some of the academic institutes and national labs with which the National Hub will be collaborating.
 
 IIT-K mentioned that ICME-based solutions have huge potential in government sectors such as defence, atomic energy and railways as well as public and private industries working in the area of steel, aluminium and automotive. 
 
 Therefore, the hub will work on providing ICME-based solutions for these sectors as a starting point. The current focus areas for research will include structural materials such as high strength steel and aluminium, engineering polymers, composites and additive manufacturing, informed a faculty member.
