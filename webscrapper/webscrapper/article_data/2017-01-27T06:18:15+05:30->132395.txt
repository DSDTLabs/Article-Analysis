MANGALURU: Nethravathi Samyukta Rakshana Samiti that is spearheading the fight against the   on Thursday demanded that the government must take steps to stop the same in the forthcoming budget session of state legislature, which is getting under way on February 6.

 If the government fails to do so, the samiti will undertake an indefinite hunger strike from February 10 and thereafter, decide on intensifying the agitation to force the government to drop the same.
 
 Samiti leaders that included   MP Nalin Kumar Kateel, former   and others, garlanded statues of   inside the   and Mahatma Gandhi in the park in front of Town Hall prior to announcing their next course of action regarding the project. 
 
 The government in the meanwhile, has expressed its intent to go ahead with implementing the project that aims to provide water to the parched districts.
 
 Contrary to widespread expectations that the samiti leadership will resort to something dramatic on Republic Day as hinted by them at a recent media briefing, it was more somber and democratic assertion of their intent to intensify agitation against the project. However, the leadership at the same time hinted that the samiti has the wherewithal to undertake a surgical strike type operation that will hurt the government’s interest in the project where it matters the most.
 
 Vijaykumar Shetty said while the government could stop mining at Kudremukh after the direction from the Supreme Court, it can also do so with regard to the Yettinahole project. The MP said the meeting convened by the CM to discuss the pros and cons of the event was a failed attempt and the officials did not get any convincing answers to allay fears of people that implementing the project will have an adverse affect on their drinking water availability. Ivan D’Souza, chief whip of the government in the state legislative council, dared the opposition to move calling attention motion in the budget session demanding that the project be dropped.
