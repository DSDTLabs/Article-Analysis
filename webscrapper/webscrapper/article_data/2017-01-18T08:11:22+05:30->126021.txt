JAIPUR:   is facing   in cracking deal for   After   buy back offer ran into controversy, government is now finding difficult to get helicopters from private players in year-long contract. 

 To save cost, the general administration department (GAD) wanted to hire helicopter from private players by signing a long-term contract with them. However, it did not materialize as only one firm submitted the proposal.
 
 “We received bid only from one company. It will be placed before the empowered committee to avoid any controversy. But there were expectations that few more would come,” said the sources. “Aviation companies increase their rates during elections. So we will now have to hire it at higher prices,” added the official. 
 
 Officials claim with elections in five states, availability of the choppers are next to zero. The long term contract could have been a saviour for the state but now state will have to resort to take services as and when required. 
 
 At present, GAD hires helicopter when it is needed by the chief minister. For the services, it pays about Rs 1-1.5 lakh per hour and incurs Rs 6 crore per year. According to the officials, getting into a contract would have reduced the cost by almost 25%.
 
 Need to wheel out new arrangement has come after GADs repeated failure to sell the twin-engine Italian-made Augusta 190-E helicopter. It has been out of service since a clip on its rotor broke down in November 2011.
