AHMEDABAD:   on Tuesday stayed the Rajkot crime branch from taking coercive action against a Mumbai-based businessman, after the latter complained that cops were trying to abduct him from his office without following procedure over a bailable offence.

 Rajkot police registered an FIR for criminal intimidation and sexual harassment against Mukesh Gupta (61). He urged the HC to quash the FIR, claiming innocence and on the grounds that the FIR was filed by a relative to pressure him into a compromise in civil proceedings relating to a business that are pending in a Mumbai court.
 
 Besides quashing of the FIR, Gupta also demanded action against the Rajkot cops who allegedly went to Mumbai last month to bring him to Rajkot. In his petition, Gupta claimed that the cops were in plain clothes and insisted on taking him to Rajkot in a car.
 
 However, Gupta and his relatives in Mumbai inquired whether Rajkot police had followed procedure to take action against him for a bailable offence. He questioned how the cops could take him with them without even issuing summons. He then took the cops to BKC police station, to verify if they were really cops and if they had informed local police before making an arrest. This put the Rajkot cops in a precarious situation. They then left Gupta at the police station and disappeared. Before this, they wrote ‘summons’ on the spot, without mentioning an outward number and handed him the paper.
 
 Gupta’s counsel, Sujay Kantawala, said a legal notice was issued to all concerned authorities in Gujarat before approaching the high court. After a preliminary hearing, Justice S H Vora stayed police from taking action against Gupta and issued notice to Rajkot police, seeking their reply to the allegations by April 26.
