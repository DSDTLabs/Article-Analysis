CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Friday gave a “last chance” to   government to file draft rules on appointment of law officers. The government should hand over the copies of the rules to amicus curiae within 10 days.

 The partisan appointment process was brought to the court's notice by a lawyer who referred to the March 30 judgment of the Supreme Court and said appointment of law officers could not be done solely on political considerations and that the judiciary should be consulted in the matter. The court had then appointed amicus curiae in the matter.
 
 On Monday, the first bench of Chief justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice M Sundar said advocate general had informed the court that the rules were still in the process of being formulated. 
 
 “We find that this process has been going on for quite some months and at the request of the AG, we grant last opportunity to file the draft rules and hand over the copies to amicus within 10 days, failing which the amicus curie proceed to suggest the rules themselves ignoring contribution which the state government wanted to give, but have not given till date,” said the bench.
 
 It also directed the   government to hand over the already prepared draft rules -- Puducherry Law Officers (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2016 -- to the amicus curie on Monday. Following this, the amicus curiae said he would require around two weeks’ time to examine the rules and make the suggestions.
 
 The matter has been posted for further hearing on February 13.
