Today is the 19th birth anniversary of internet giant Google Inc. The company celebrated its birthday with a surprise spinner Doodle that takes users back to its most memorable Doodle games. 

 In order to play the games, you need to spin the wheel of the Doodle. The spinner has games from the past 19 years such as musical puzzle game celebrating Beethovenâ€™s 245th birthday, or Magic Cat Academy Halloween game from 2016.
 
 It has also added a brand-new Snake game to its Search Funbox, which is also a part of one of these 19 wheel surprise games. The wheel also includes other search result games such as tic-tac-toe and an Earth Day quiz. 
 
 Users can play this game anytime by searching "snake game," or just type "  surprise spinner" in the browser to give the wheel a spin and try out the other Doodle games.
 
 The 2010 Pac Man browser game is also a part of the Doodle games. There is also a cricket game which was created to celebrate the ICC Champions Trophy. It lets you play cricket as a literal cricket and is incredibly addictive.
 
 Also included in the spinner wheel is last year's Doodle for Hallowe'en that looked distinctly cute. The Harry Potter-esque game taught you how to use spells and make your way through a library.
 
 Scovile scales, the Doodle which was created to honour Wilbur Scovile, the man who measured how hot chilis are. The game commemorates this by showing the scientist eating a chilli and then cooling his mouth down with ice cream.
