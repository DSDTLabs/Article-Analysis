Pune: Nearly six months after it was dissolved, no alternative arrangement has yet been made to replace the municipal school board.

 The dissolved board used to look after nearly 1 lakh students studying in municipal schools. However, the Pune Municipal Corporation ( ) has not yet formed a separate committee to look after the affairs of the municipal schools, as mandated by the state government.
 
 The municipal school board was dissolved in June 2017 after the end of its tenure. An order, issued by the commissioner’s office, had stated that the PMC would set up an education department, which would look after the functioning of the primary and secondary education divisions.
 
 As per the order, the civic body’s central stores depot had been made given the responsibility to purchase stationery and other material for the department. The PMC’s finance and audit departments were to control the financial transactions.
 
 Civic officials said there were a total of 287 primary schools and 30 secondary schools run by the PMC, which should now function under the PMC’s education department. The department is to be headed by the additional municipal commissioner (general). The education officer is to oversee the secondary division, while the administrative officer (education) is to look after the primary division. The staff working in school board are to be shifted to other departments as per their ranks.
 
 “Currently, the civic officials are performing the duties of the board. The state government had given orders to form a committee, but that has not been done yet. Considering the future of these students, an education committee should be formed,” said a proposal tabled by corporator Yogesh Sasane.
 
 Sasane’s proposal has been tabled before the PMC’s general body. “The proposal is to be approved by the general body. The decision about forming the committee will be taken after a green signal from the elected members,” said a senior official of the PMC.
