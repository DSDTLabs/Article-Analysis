KIRLAMPUDI: This small mandal headquarters town in East Godavari is virtually under siege with the police taking no chances even as former minister and Kapu leader   is gearing up for the proposed   march along with members of his community on July 26.The state government has deployed over 3,000 police personnel and opened 20 check-posts around the village, restricting the movement of the people. The police are counselling the Kapu leaders and youth not to join Mudragada's march. However, the Kapu leaders allege that the police were taking written assurances from them not to join the Chalo Amaravati walkathon.

 The Kapu JAC had announced that it would take up the the Chalo Amaravati march covering four districts where the community is numerically strong. The march is part of the Kapus' agitation seeking BC status for the community as promised by   du. While the   claim that the march is only proposed to mount pressure on the chief minister to fulfil his promise by extending BC status for the community, the police and the state government are out to stall it citing the infamous arson in Tuni in January, 2016.
 
 “We have promised to conduct the peace march in a Gandhian way. It is for the police to provide protection and see that anti-social elements do not take advantage,“ asserted Kapu JAC convener   while said on Saturday.
