AHMEDABAD: After reprimanding the state government over the shoddy probe into the  , Gujarat high court on Tuesday handed over the investigation to an ACP rank officer. It may be recalled that four patients became blind after botched cataract surgeries at the hospital.

 The high court has also directed the DCP of the area to monitor the investigation. The court has sought a report on the probe after a month's time. The police, however, have been barred from filing the chargesheet in this case without first placing the probe report be fore the court.
 
 Interestingly, Justice Pardiwala has ordered the police not to rely on reports of three laboratories ­ LG Hospital, NHL Medical College and   ­ which had found fault in the   antiseptic liquid used during the surgeries.The high court said that police should go by the results of the report given by the Government Food & Drugs Laboratory. The public analyst has given a clean chit to the manufacturers of Savlon by stating that the drug conformed to the standards set by the government.
 
 The high court has also directed the police to inves tigate the aspect of medical negligence by the doctors involved in the surgery.
 
 The court is hearing this case on the basis of a quas hing petition filed by four manufacturers of Savlon, who have been arraigned in the case on charges of supp lying contaminated drug.
 
 Earlier, the high court had criticised the authoriti es for differences in the out come of analysis of the drug. The court observed that the same drug was used by private hospitals but no incident of blinding had be en reported till date.. The court also questioned why such blinding inci dents happened only in pub lic hospitals.
 
 “The skill or the care with which the surgeries are performed at government and municipal hospitals should also be a matter of serious concern before levelling allegations against the manufacturer,“ the court observed.
