Mumbai: Four men—one of them impersonated as state education minister Vinod Tawde—have been booked for allegedly cheating a Mankhurd homemaker and another victim of a total Rs 3.72 lakh. 

 The FIR lodged at Kalachowkie police station names Chinchpokli resident  , his aides Satyavan and   and an unidentified accused. “In her complaint, Rashi Rane (36) said she came in contact with Surve on Facebook. They started chatting regularly and she asked Surve to help her earn some money,” said a police officer.
 
 In February, Surve told her that he would buy cellphones and   cards in her name which would be used by his employees to make calls to his clients and in return she would get 5-10% commission. “Surve took her ID proof documents and money to buy two phones,” said the officer. “As she did not get any commission, she would call Surve, but he always made excuses. During one call, Surve claimed he was with minister Tawde who assured Rane her that Surve’s firm would soon pay her   and even for the phones.” After waiting for four months, she approached the police. During probe, the cops learnt the gang had cheated another victim and bought 10 phones in his name. 
 
 Senior police inspector Dilip Ugale said, “Surve’s phone is switched off, we are trying to retrieve his call data records.”
