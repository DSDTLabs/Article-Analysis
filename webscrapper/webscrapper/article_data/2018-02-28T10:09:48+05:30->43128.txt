THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The  , through its subsequent verdicts, has sabotaged its own historical verdict made on December 15, 2016 banning sale of liquor along highways, said senior   leader and former speaker V M  . 

 "After contradicting the verdict in the ' ' in July 2017, the apex court has now issued an order authorizing state governments to open liquor outlets at the panchayat-level. The order, which will have destructive consequences in society, has scuttled the court's own earlier verdict which got wide acclaim," Sudheeran said in a statement issued here on Monday.
 
 The court's change of stance on an issue, most crucial for the betterment of the country and its people, is most surprising and shocking, Sudheeran said. "The reasons behind this change of stance have not yet been elucidated. People have the right to debate and point out flaws in decisions being made by constitutional bodies."
 
 "So, the SC verdict of February 23, 2018, which has in effect nullified its earlier order banning liquor outlets along highways, should be put up for an open discussion. People's court is above all other courts of law in the country. Let it assess the SC order," he said.
 
 Criticising the state government's liquor policy, Sudheeran said substance abuse was still on a rise in spite of liberal opening of bars across the state. "The state is in a big financial crisis too. The government's arguments that opening of bars will bring down drug abuse and improve state's financial position have been proved wrong," he said.
 
    government, he said, is among other state governments which have been favoured by the latest SC verdict. "The government has its priority in protecting the interests of liquor mafia ," he added.
