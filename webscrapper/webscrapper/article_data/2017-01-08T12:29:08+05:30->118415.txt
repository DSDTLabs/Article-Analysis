LUCKNOW: The   is planning to utilise the space atop the underground   airport metro   to be ready by December 2019 by building a huge parking facility or with landscaping. LMRC recently got about 5,000 Sqm land in airport area from AAI for construction of the CCS Airport metro station. 

  said, “Once the underground station is ready, we will be left with a large vacant area above the station. This was as an approach road to airport so far but now that we own it, we may plan to build a large parking area or even consider developing a park or landscape on it.”
 
 The approval would be sought from AAI once the plan is ready. Incidentally, a parking area exists there even at present but as soon as the land goes to LMRC, its utilisation will be Metro’s prerogative. “Since a lot of people drive up to airport to pick or drop, a big parking area is needed there. If AAI allows, we will continue let the space continue as parking, or would develop a green space.
