PATNA:   has become rampant outside the   building in  . At least five bikes of Degree part III examinees that had been parked on the road in front of the college were allegedly stolen on Monday.
 
  “Due to the absence of a proper parking lot on the B D College campus, teachers and students park their vehicles on the road. They can’t even utilize the space under the Bhikhari Thakur flyover for parking as it is occupied by unauthorized khatals and food vendors,” said a source on Thursday.
  
  According to B D College principal Sanjoy Kumar, three government quarters located adjacent to its building have been allotted to the college administration. “While one quarter is meant for a girls’ hostel, two more quarters are yet to be freed from illegal occupants by the district administration. We are planning to develop a parking lot on one of the occupied quarters,” he said, adding, “We are ready to develop a parking area under the Bhikhari Thakur flyover for the time being if the work is assigned to the college by the district administration.”
  
  The administration recently launched an anti-encroachment drive in Mithapur locality, but to no avail. Unauthorized khatals and vendors have once again occupied the space under the Bhikhari Thakur flyover.
  
  Students, on the other hand, urged police and the district administration to punish the culprits and recover their stolen vehicles.
