Ludhiana: This time, teachers will not be able to escape examination duty as the state education board has asked the health department to issue medical certificates for leave only in emergency cases.

 The final examinations of classes X and XII of the Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) will commence from February 28, for which hundreds of teachers are put on duty. PSEB has taken this step in view of the previous instances wherein many teachers took leave from duty. The letter written by the board seeks instructions to all chief medical officers and civil surgeons to ensure that during examination, medical certificates are issued only in severe cases.
 
 Chairperson of the Punjab School Education Board Balbir Singh Dhol said, “Every year, the board faces a deluge of leave applications of teachers appointed on examination duty. This affects board examination. Most teachers get medical certificate to escape the duty. So this time we have asked the health department to get strict.”
 
 About the number of such cases reported every year, Dhol said, “The state percentage would be around 2% of the total appointed teachers, but even if two or three teachers are absent from examination duty, it becomes difficult to manage. Many cases have been reported where otherwise teachers are on routine duty but as soon as they are appointed on exam duty, they ask for a medical leave. Our motive is to stop such practice.”
 
 He added that the health department has been asked to be considerate with genuine cases to avoid harassment.
 
 Teachers, however, are not happy. A member of the teachers’ association said, “After the recent instructions, I wonder on what parameters medical officers will decide genuine and non-genuine cases. Besides, the board has reserve teams also for exam duty in case of emergency leaves.”
 
 Chief medical officer, Ludhiana, Dr Rajiv Bhalla said, “Following the PSEB letter, the SMO has been issued instructions.”
