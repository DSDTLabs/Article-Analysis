THRISSUR: "The CPM is holding peace talks on one side while killing people on the other part,"   said here on Wednesday after visiting the family of party worker Nirmal, who was killed on Sunday during a   near Nellankara.

 Alleging that the CPM was trying to hush up the case denying any political rivalry behind it, Kummanam sought the   to appoint a special team for investigating the case.
 
 "  has been another evidence of the anti-dalit approach of the CPM. It should expel those party activists, including the councillor who was an accused in the case," added Kummanam. He pointed out that the National Human Rights Commission has already intervened in the case.
