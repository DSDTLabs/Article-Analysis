MUMBAI: Prior to their visit of the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Saturday, a delegation led by  , the head of events at FIFA, had expressed concerns about the pace of work and other issues at three venues that are scheduled to host the U-17 FIFA World Cup in October this year.

 While Kochi have a lot of ground to cover before they are ready for the Oct. 6-28 event, FIFA is worried about the number of spectators that would eventually turn up for the games in Goa. Yarza & Co.are also sceptical of the quality of air that would prevail in Delhi at that time of the year, given that the festival season would be underway. To their relief, and satisfaction, the delegation was thrilled with the state of affairs at the DY Patil Stadium. 
 
 “I said last year that I was happy with the stadium and I haven't changed my mind. It's a fantastic venue and most of the work we had requested in order to host the World Cup have been completed,” Yarza told reporters after taking stock of the preparations on Saturday.
 
 “We have no worry and I reckon everything will be in place in the coming months here. The new dressing rooms are of very high quality, and we are very happy with the overall preparations.
 
 This is one of the best stadiums in the country and we are proud to be here,” he added.
