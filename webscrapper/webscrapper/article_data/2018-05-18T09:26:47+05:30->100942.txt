CHENNAI:   has not got a new medical college or additional   seats in existing colleges this year, though the number of MBBS aspirants who wrote NEET has gone up by more than 25,000. This will make entry to medical colleges far tougher than last year, as academicians predict up to a 5 point increase in cutoff.

 
 “Students were more prepared for admission this year compared to 2017. We are expecting better scores and pass percentage. But there will be no additional seats to accommodate some of them,” said Arunkumar S, who offers NEET coaching at a private tutorial.
 
 A small consolation is that   in   has decided to surrender seats to the state government for admission this year. Last year, as a mark of protest against NEET, CMC did not hold admissions. It also opposed revision of the rules that made it mandatory for all admissions to be done by the state government’s Selection Committee, Directorate of Medical Education.
 
 Senior health officials and state selection committee secretary G Selvarajan, who is in charge of admissions to all colleges in the state, held a meeting with private college administrations earlier this week asking non-minority colleges to surrender 50% seats and minority institutions to give away 35% seats for the state quota. “There was no resentmentor protest.They have all promised to fall in line,” said a senior official.
 
 “As of now there is no addition or deletion in the numbers. If we receive any further communications from MCI, we may add or delete seats,” said Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University registrar Dr T Balasubramanian on Thursday.
 
 This year a total of 2,900 MBBS seats will be on offer at 21 government colleges and the lone ESIC college in Coimbatore, besides 150 seats at the state-administered   and 1,450 seats at 12 self-financing colleges. Of the 2,900 seats, the state will surrender 15% to the Centre for admission under All India Quota by the directorate general of health services.
