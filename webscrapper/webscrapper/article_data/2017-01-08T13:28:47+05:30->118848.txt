BHOPAL: In a first, after electrifying 100% villages,   are now looking for partners in villages of the state to electrify around 5,000 hamlets with a population below 100 that are still left out of electrification. 

 There are around 23,000 village panchayats in Madhya Pradesh and all of them are electrified. However, some hamlets having a population of less than or 100 are left behind in electrification. Given topography of the state, most of these hamlets are habitations, which have one to few houses and are situated faraway. 
 
 The manpower is proving a major challenge to electrify these hamlets. There are five linemen to check complaints in 30 villages, sources said. Similarly, a significant manpower is required for meter reading in these hamlets and for collection of bills, sources said. As these hamlets are situated in remote areas and have few houses, it doesn't make economic sense for discoms to hire manpower for these hamlets, sources said.
