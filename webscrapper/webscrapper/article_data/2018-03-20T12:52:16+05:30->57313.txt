PATNA: State health minister Mangal   on Monday asked the   civil surgeon to probe into a video footage showing doctors performing an operation in torchlight at Saharsa sadar hospital. Sources said the doctors resorted to the extremely unusual act because of power failure.

 Pandey said the video footage shows the injured patient getting stitches in the dressing room. “No operation was conducted. However, I have asked the civil surgeon for a detailed report. The doctors have to ensure that such incidents are not repeated in future,” the minister said.
 
 According to sources, the date of operation was not known. Sources said there was no generator set at the hospital.
 
 The incident came to light days after another video showed a patient getting operated in cellphone torchlight in   district. In the video, a doctor was seen sewing the right hand of an unconscious woman in cellphone torchlight after power failure.
 
 “We are not authorized to give any information,” an official at Saharsa sadar hospital told TOI over the phone on Monday.
