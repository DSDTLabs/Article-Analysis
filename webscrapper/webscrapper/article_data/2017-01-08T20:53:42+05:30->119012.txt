BANGALORE: The   and functional   was inaugurated in the city Sunday, making the Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain hospital the first in Karnataka to launch a dedicated institute such as this for minimally invasive  .

 Functional neurosurgery refers to a kind of surgery that improves the functionality and movement of a patient, who is usually dysfunctional due to a neurological disorder.
 
 Essentially, it improves the movements of those suffering from tremors caused by neurological disorders and from dystonia.
 
 The team will be headed by Dr Sharan Srinivas, a senior neurosurgeon who is one of the few neurosurgeons from Karnataka to be trained by Professor Takaomi Taira of Japan, one of the leading authorities in the field and Dr Sanjiv CC, a movement disorder specialist.
 
 "Pacemakers, that can be placed in the brain to control the tremors cost between Rs 7 and Rs 12 lakhs, putting it out of the reach of most Indians. The radio frequency ablation surgery, that I was trained in in Japan, will cost the patient only Rs 1 to Rs 2 lakhs" said Dr Srinivas.
 
 "Only 5-6 centres in India conduct these surgeries in India" said Dr Sanjiv. "Out of a 100 people, 5-10 suffer from tremors caused by Parkinsons disease, dystonia is rarer with 5-10 people out of 1,000 suffering from it".
 
 The first patient to benefit from the surgery conducted by the institute was a patient of cervical dystonia. For the past 10 years, his neck had been pulling from side to side, tremors, which made it impossible for him to look straight. Eating too was a problem, as he would have to hold his head in place with his right hand and feed himself with his left.
 
 Post-surgery, his tremors have reduced by 60 per cent and he can now look straight ahead while walking. Last week, was also the first time in 10 years that he was able to eat with his right hand.
