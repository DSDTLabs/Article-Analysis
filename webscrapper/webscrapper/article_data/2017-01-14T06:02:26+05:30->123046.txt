CHANDIGARH: With   president Captain   set to begin the campaign again next week, the party plans to revive the “insider-outsider“ debate following the statement by Delhi's deputy chief minister   that people of Punjab should vote assuming   (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal will be the next CM of the state.

 Sources in Congress said the entire Congress campaign was planned by the party's strategist   with projection of Amarinder as the “Son of the Soil“ and keeping in mind the possibility of Kejriwal staking claim at the top post in the state. “Sisodia's statement is just what the Congress and Kishor's team needed since they started campaigning with the brand `Punjab Da Captain'. The key focus will be narrative of Punjabi vs Non-Punjabi, of Punjabiyat and assertion of Punjabi identity ,“ said a party leader.
