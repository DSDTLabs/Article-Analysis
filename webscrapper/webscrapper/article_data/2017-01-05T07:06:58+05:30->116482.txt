NEW DELHI: Congress did not rule out the possibility of an alliance with Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, with its chief ministerial candidate   saying   would be the mascot in case of a tie-up. 

 Soon after the election commission announced poll schedule for five states, Congress said its primary objective was to keep the fascist forces out of power.
 
 Ghulam Nabi Azad, party general secretary in-charge of UP, indicated that Congress was keen on tying up with SP and that the only hindrance was the confusion created by the feud in the Yadav clan.
 
 “As of now, we are working on the recommendations of the screening committee for (candidates on) all the 403 seats in the state ...what can happen in future will be known only later ... but there is a lot of pressure on secular parties (for alliance),“ he said in Lucknow.
 
 Dikshit stepped in to say that in case of an alliance, Akhilesh was likely to be the face of the joint campaign since he was young as well as experienced. “If there is an alliance and there are joint efforts, then I would rather step aside as the CM candidate. If SP and Congress work together, there cannot be two faces,“ she said, with agencies quoting her as saying that she would prefer that the alliance has a young chief ministerial face.
 
 She, however, refused to make “assumptions“ on which way would the issue of alliance settle, saying she had not been consulted and would abide by the decision of the high command. When told that the party was not denying the possibility, she said, “Nobody is ruling it out but nobody is finalising it.“
 
 Dikshit said Akhilesh Yadav's public remarks that an alliance with Congress will fetch them over 300 seats alerted her to the possibility.
