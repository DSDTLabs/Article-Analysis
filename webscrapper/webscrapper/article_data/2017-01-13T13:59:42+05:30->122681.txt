Not many may know that   was the reason that Taapsee got herself a role in her most successful film till date, Pink. 2016 was the year when Bollywood and the audience recognised Taapsee's talent and her popularity grew double fold. As she forays into a league of her own,   is over the moon with the release of her much awaited release Running Shaadi being a few weeks from now. For several reasons the film was delayed for release and the actress had a deep desire to visit the holy place of Golden Temple as a wish to have the film see a release. 

  
  
 The moment she learnt of the release, the actress was busy shooting for a film in Delhi. On her only day off, she quickly arranged to go to Amritsar to fulfil her wish To visit the Gurudwara upon the confirmation of the release. Soon after she was joined by the director, Amit Roy and her co-star Amit Sadh. Speaking on it, Taapsee said, "I remember last year when I was really praying and hoping running shaadi to release I promised that the day the announcement of the release is made I will visit golden temple within a week from wherever I am. Thankfully I was in Delhi when this announcement was made so after a night shoot I immediately took the morning flight and came back the same evening to join back my shoot. When I told about my plan to Amit Roy he instantly agreed to join with   and 3 of us had a surreal experience going back to the place where we gave our first shot of Running Shaadi, once again together."
