NEW DELHI: A fortnight after an employee of a businessman was robbed and shot dead by bikers near the   police station, police have arrested two men and apprehended a teeanger in the case.

 It was found that for three days the accused had been trailing the victim,   — who usually carried cash from the businessman’s shop — before attacking him.
 
 Police spotted two of them — Kishan and Mangal — near  , when they were tracking another businessman in the same way. 
 
 “A raid was conducted at their hideout. The pistol, which was used to shoot Amarchand was recovered from Kishan. A scooter and the cash bag of the victim was also recovered,” said Jatin Narwhal, DCP, north.
 
 The accused admitted that they had shot Amarchand after he resisted their attempt to rob him. They told officers that they used to follow employees of businessmen leaving wholesale markets with cash bags and confront them at desolate places at gunpoint. If the victims resisted, the accused did not hesitate to shoot.
 
 On April 27, Amarchand and his two colleagues had collected Rs 3lakh from a garment shop in Chandni Chowk and returned to Sarai Rohilla in an auto rickshaw. They had planned to deposit the money the next day. 
 
 They got off near the DDA flats in Vivekanandapuri and were walking to their apartment when they were waylaid by the robbers. When Amarchand resisted, he was shot by Kishan who fled with his bag.
 
 Amarchand was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.
 
 While probing the case, police scanned the CCTV footages of the route taken by Amarchand and in one of the videos they noticed three men moving suspiciously. Later, going through other footages from the area, officers found the same men tracking other businessmen. One of the police informers identified Kishan.
 
 The teenager was produced before the juvenile justice board that sent him to a correctional home. The other two were sent to police remand.
