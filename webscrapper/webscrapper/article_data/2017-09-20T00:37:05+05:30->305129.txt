Madurai: Human rights violations have larger spectrum and adequate awareness should be created to prevent them, stated Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao as he inaugurated the national level human rights defenders training programme organised by Department of Religion, Philosophy and Sociology of the American College here on Tuesday.

 The two-day programme has been organised in collaboration with BIRDS (Brothers Integrated Rural Development Society) and Human Rights Resource Centre, Bangalore on September 19 and 20. The head of the department Rev Dr Arul Arasu Israel welcomed the gathering. Rev Bro Albert Xavier, director of BIRDS introduced the training program. Principal and secretary of the college Dr M Davamani Christober presided and delivered the presidential address.
 
 Inaugurating the programme, Madurai collector Veera Raghava Rao stressed on the importance and role of human rights in our society. Human rights violations were often viewed as sexual oppression but it has wider range. Even forced beggary is a human rights violation and littering public places is also a human rights violation against the people in society. It should be studied in its larger context and redressed upon, he stated.
 
 Rev Bro Dr Innachimuthu, principal, Sacred Heart College, Dindigul facilitated the programme. Faculty from the department, Dr M Shahul Hameed proposed the vote of thanks. Around 160 students from various colleges of south Indian states are taking part in the programme.
 
 Explaining the objective of the programme, Arul Arasu Israel said that human rights violation happens around us, but one doesnâ€™t notice. Human rights defenders have to keep their eyes open towards such violations and intervene to protect the victims. During the programme they are taught how to use the articles in Indian constitutions to protect human rights, he added.
