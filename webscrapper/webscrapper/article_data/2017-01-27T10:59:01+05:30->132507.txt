LUCKNOW:   and   are haggling over seats in Amethi and  ,the parliamentary turf of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul.

 Congress, which managed to get 105 of the 403 seats under the seat-sharing deal with the SP after hard negotiations, is in no mood to give up its claim over all the ten seats in Amethi-Rae Bareli.
 
 Sources said the party was perturbed as none of the five candidates declared by its alliance partner earlier has been withdrawn by SP.
 
 "SP had announced five candidates in these parliamentary constituencies before the alliance was sealed but since then no name has been withdrawan and local Congress leaders are especailly perturbed over the issue," a senior Congress leader said here.
 
 Though both the sides are more or less agreeable to a broad understanding that Congress will get 6 and SP 4, local leaders and workers are not ready to give up either Amethi or Gauriganj Assembly seats from where SP has already announced its candidates, he said.
 
 Congress, which is looking for a major share, also wants freedom to choose its nominees rather than blindly following the "sitting-getting" formula.
 
 "Giving tickets on the basis of previous performance will only benefit rivals and we cannot afford to see reverses for failure to forsee them," he said.
 
 Without assessing the situation and winnability of each candidate before fielding them would be like helping BSP, he said, citing the example of Sareni in Rae Bareli.
 
 SP has given ticket to its sitting MLA in Sareni but situation there has undergone a major change since 2012 and now even their supporters are against them, he said, apprehending that the seat could go to BSP in case the same candidate is repeated.
 
 It is essential that both the alliance partners work towards assessing each others' strong and weak points seat-wise or else it will cause more harm than benefit to the ideals for which both the parties have come together, he said.
