MUMBAI: Somen Shah, head, marketing excellence,  , had hosted two parties at Hotel Renaissance,  , last month.   commissioner Ashwini Joshi, in a letter to TOI after a report on Wednesday, said Shah had hosted parties on January 8 and 10. Shah had applied and obtained a one-day   to serve liquor for the   on January 8.

 “Along with the application for one-day liquor licence, he had furnished an affidavit stating that he is bound to follow excise rules. It is clear that Shah was well aware of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act (1949) and rules which mandate one-day liquor licence for his party on January 10. But he failed to apply for it, and therefore a crime was registered against him,” said Joshi. “It is difficult to believe that a citizen who is aware of the law on January 8 is not aware about it on January 10,” added Joshi. 
 
 Shah was held on January 10 but for non-possession of a one-day temporary licence to serve liquor. He was released on bail the next day. Hotel Renaissance, where the two parties were held, said no liquor was served on January 10. Since January 2017, the excise department registered non-bailable offences in 11 cases. Officials said convictions are less than 1% and can take as much as a decade. 
 
 Abbott reiterated its earlier stand.
