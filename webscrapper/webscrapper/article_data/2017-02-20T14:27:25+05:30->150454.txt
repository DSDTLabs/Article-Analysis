BHOPAl: Is Yoga guru turned entrepreneur Baba Ramdev disillusioned with   led NDA government over the issue of black money. In a guarded language, the saffron clad Baba said the government should “ reconsider the Rs 2000 currency note “ started by the government post  .

 He said he supported NDA government for its campaign on corruption .Even if the Congress seeks support from me for some good work, he would extend his support to the party.
 
 Talking to media in   on Monday, Ramdev said that the Rs 2000 note is “not good”. When asked to explain further, he said, the currency notes of big denomination become medium for crime. 
 
 They are used by drug dealers, terrorists and Naxalites. And which is why prime minister Narendra Modi had withdrawn them.
 
 “ For the economy of any country, the currency notes of big denomination are not good which is why in the coming days the government should reconsider over the issue Rs 2000 notes”, he explained.
 
 When asked why he has been vague these days while talking about the issue of black money that it was to be brought back from abroad, Ramdev said, sandhu sant ko nirmohi hona chaheeye” ( a saint should be detached) .
 
 He said in 2014 Lok Sabha election he did support Narendra Modi and there was no hidden agenda. “ I did it khullam khulla ( openly) “, he said.
 
 It was the time of “ political disappointment and people were frustrated with scams”, he said.
 
 Ramdev said that he had already been raising the issue of black money and Modi told me that “he is with me.. not 100 % but 200% on the issue”.
  
 “ If my government comes we will bring back the black money and eradicate the corruption. I trusted him”, he said. Modi has been in power for three years and two years are still left. So far his track record has been that whatever he commits, he delivers, Baba expressed hope.
 
 I still trust him and I am also not disillusioned ,he said.
