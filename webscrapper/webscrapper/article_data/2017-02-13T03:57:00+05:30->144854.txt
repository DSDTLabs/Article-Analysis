Panaji: Stating that the illegal organ donation is now finding its way into bigger hospitals as well, a panel of experts, comprising of doctors and activists was of the opinion that laws regulating organ donations need to be amended along with strict implementation.

 “There are many cases where a poor person, who is in need of money is ready to donate his organ to a rich person. If this kind of an arrangement comes to light, the donor is also held in criminal conspiracy. The law should actually recognize them as victims of organ donation rackets,” surgeon Sanjay Nagral said at a panel discussion on the organ donation scenario in the country, adding that such donors are not made aware of the risks and complications of the surgeries.
 
 The panelist said that current laws are strong enough in terms of curbing the illegal organ trade racket, but its implementation is far from satisfactory.
 
 Faculty in-charge of the Organ Retrieval Banking Organization (ORBO), New Delhi, Dr Aarti Vij said that although the new generation is still opening up to the idea of organ donation, the older generation is yet to accept it due to various reasons.
 
 “Often, we see one member ready to donate the organs of a brain dead family member but the others are not ready for it. Families should take a collective decision. There are religious myths against the phenomenon, so we are working with various religious groups to create awareness. Hurdles are also created due to people’s belief that the body will be disfigured, or due to police investigations and at times, simply, lack of empathy,” Vij said.
 
 The panelist also spoke about the rise in cases of illegal organ trafficking at renowned private institutes as well. “There are cases where people marry the donor, get the operation done and then divorce to escape any legal implications,” Nagral said.
