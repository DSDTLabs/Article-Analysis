CHENNAI: The   on Tuesday said they had arrested a woman and a man she was having a relationship with for the murder of her husband. 

 Police said Murali, 36, was married to Vanaja, 31, and the couple had two sons. Murali became friends with Ramesh, 28, during a business deal and invited him to the housewarming of his new residence. Ramesh met Vanaja at the function.
 
 Vanaja took down Ramesh's phone number and kept in touch with him. Earlier this month, Vanaja, while returning home after shopping, dropped and broke a high-end cellphone. She confessed to Murali that Ramesh had gifted her the phone. Murali checked the phone and found personal messages to and from Ramesh. Murali told his wife to call off the affair but Ramesh persisted in visiting Vanaja when he was away. Neighbours alerted Murali about the visits.
 
 Ramesh told Vanaja that the only way to continue the relationship was to kill Murali. He paid a gang of contract killers to eliminate Murali. On January 19, as Murali was returning home from work near Oragadam, the gang killed him. The killers smashed his motorcycle to make it look like he had met with an accident.
 
 "Neighbours told us that Ramesh was a regular visitor to the house," an investigating officer said. "During interrogation, Ramesh and Vanaja confessed to the crime." Police are searching for the gang members who killed Murali.
