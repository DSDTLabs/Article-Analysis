 The " " quoted official sources as saying the fire was "quickly extinguished". There was no official mention about the extent of damage to the 1,300-year-old temple or the cause of fire.
 
 The official "People's Daily" said there had been "no damage to relics" in the temple. The incident happened a day before Losar, the Tibetan New Year, when many people visit the shrine.
 
 Official reports said the temple was closed on Saturday. Photographs and videos posted on social media show the fire in one portion of the temple, one of the most hallowed places in Tibet, blazing in the night. Unconfirmed reports indicate there were valuable relics in the affected portion of the temple which may have been damaged.
 
 The fire has caused some surprises because the Jokhang temple is closely monitored by guards and security cameras because the local government is keen to curb protest demonstrations. Official reports did not explain which part of the six-acre temple premises had been affected. Social media reports indicate the fire may have occurred in a side hall that may be a housing area for monks.
