 mogul   and music streaming service   are releasing a new posthumous   album. 

  According to a report, the announcement comes after   and Tidal settled their legal dispute.Jay-Z is working with the Prince Estate to select "previously unreleased music sourced from Prince's vast archive of Vault recordings" for the upcoming release, which is expected to drop in 2019. 
 
  
  
  The album will first stream exclusively on Tidal for 14 days and a download will be available seven days after its debut. A physical release will follow thereafter from the Prince Estate. 
 
  "Our only goal is to share Prince's music with his fans as he wanted. After (a) thoughtful and honest conversation with him, he chose Tidal as his partner for   Phase One and 'HitnRun' Phase Two, and we will continue to respect and honor Prince's enduring legacy and wishes with this new collection," Jay-Z said in a statement. 
 
  Prince's estate had sued Jay-Z's Roc Nation, which owns Tidal, in 2016 for copyright infringement over claims Prince's music had been streamed without permission.
