 According to sources, dozens of women went in the chaupal on Wednesday morning and discussed the condition of their families. They said that their husbands and sons who go to work in mines or fields come home late after consuming liquor.
 
 “Village youths are alcoholics and spend all the money earned in a day on liquor,” said Mamta Kumawat, a protester.
 
 The women decided to close down the wine shop. They all went to the shop and asked the owner to down shutters. “He was adamant. So, the women came on highway and sat on a dharna. They also blocked the road with bushes due to which there were large queues of vehicles on both sides,” said police.
 
 Women alleged that drunkards at the shop create nuisance which makes it difficult for girls to move out on highway to reach their school.
 
 “We met officials of the panchayat and also wrote to the administration but nothing has been done,” added Kavuta Kumawat.
 
 On getting information, Jahajpur police reached the spot and tried to remove the blockage but the women refused to budge. “They wanted a senior officer on the spot to act against the wine shop,” said police. 
 
 The road remained blocked for about two hours. SDO Kartar Singh reached the spot and assured action.
