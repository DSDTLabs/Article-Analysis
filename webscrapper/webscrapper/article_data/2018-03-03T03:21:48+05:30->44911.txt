VIJAYAWADA: Nearly a month after Union home minister   gave the assurance, BJP president   on Friday telephoned   Pradesh chief minister and TDP president   and told him to send a delegation to New Delhi on Monday to discuss ‘all state-related issues.’ 

 Since the Union budget presentation, AP has been on a warpath over what it called meagre allocation for the state and wanted the Centre to immediately make amends. 
 
 After TDP MPs staged protests in   in the first week of February, Rajnath Singh had assured them that BJP chief Amit Shah will speak to Naidu. Chief Minister’s Office sources said, after Shah called him, Naidu informed the BJP president that the fight for justice for AP will continue without any compromise. 
 
 “We are fighting only for the interests of the people of the state. You have to understand this,” Naidu reportedly told Shah. Naidu has decided to depute a three-member team to meet Shah on Monday.
