Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) general board witnessed stormy scenes at its general board meeting on Monday evening over the issue of development of Ambedkar Memorial at Sankalp Bhoomi in Sayajibaug.

 The opposition had raised the issue of the memorial after an activist and two councillors from the opposition Congress staged a demonstration outside the mayorâ€™s chamber on the issue. The meeting turned stormy after opposition leader Chandrakant Shrivastava pointed out that the BJP was playing politics by making a memorial for Sardar Patel even as the party was responsible for the deaths of youths from the Sardar Patel Group. He was referring to the Patidar quota agitation row. tnn
