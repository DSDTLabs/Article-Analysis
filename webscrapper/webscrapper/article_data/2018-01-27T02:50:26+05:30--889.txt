NEW DELHI: With non-functioning streetlights turning many areas into dark spots at night,   Municipal Corporation has decided to replace all conventional and semi-high mast lights under its jurisdiction with   ones. The replacement exercise, which would be completed before Diwali, began from   earlier this week.

 Around 1.2 lakh conventional streetlights, many of which are non-functional due to lack of maintenance, will be replaced with LED ones within the next nine months. The intelligent streetlights will send a signal to the control room when they turn defunct so that an electrician could be sent immediately to replace them.
 
 The replacement will reduce electricity bills and maintenance cost of streetlights saving crores every year for the cash-strapped  , which finds it difficult to pay its sanitation workers, teachers, doctors and other staff due to shortage of funds. The project would lead to energy savings of 77.97% as compared to existing energy bills.
 
 EDMC commissioner Ranbir Singh said that a private agency has been hired for the exercise. “The entire expenditure of maintenance of LED lights will be borne by the private agency for seven years. The project is environment-friendly, thereby reducing the carbon footprint of the corporation,” he added.
 
 Currently, the corporation maintains streetlights and semi-high mast lights on roads that are less than 60 feet wide. It’s also responsible for lighting parks, marketplaces, colonies and public places.
 
 “I complained about non-functional streetlights in Jaffrabad and neighbouring localities to the civic officials, but they did nothing. They do not take such complaints seriously,” said Abdul Rehman, leader of opposition in EDMC.
