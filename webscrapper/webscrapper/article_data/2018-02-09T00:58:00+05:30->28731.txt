Erode: Wild boars were a nightmare to the farmers of Sathyamangalam range until recently as they used to raid crops frequently, causing the latter huge financial damages. But things have changed for good now and all that the farmers needed was a few colourful cloths, especially saris, to ward off them.

 “Wild animals, mostly wild boars, used to raid our farmlands almost every day. When all other efforts to chase them away into forest went in vain, ‘fence’ made of colourful saris has kept them away from our crops,” a farmer said.
 
 Farmers of Senbagapudur near Sathyamangalam mostly cultivate paddy, turmeric, tapioca, sugarcane, banana and jower. The crops were often destroyed by wild boars, which stray into the farmlands from the forests of Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR).
 
 The farmers had petitioned the forest department to find a solution to save the crops from wild boar raid and also chase them away into deep forest, but in vain. “Wild boars barge towards us when we try to chase them away from our fields,” they said.
 
 Recently, wild boars had damaged sugarcane, banana and other standing crops in five acres of farmland belonging to T Dhanraj, of Sengabapudur. Talking to TOI, he said raids by wild boars were very common in the region.
 
 According to the farmers, they had tried their hands at various things to keep wild boars away from their farmlands, but nothing really worked out. Finally, they erected a fence of sort by tying colourful cloths, mainly saris, to the poles. And it worked. “Wild boars get scared by seeing these cloths flying in the air,” said S Kandasamy Gounder, another farmer.
 
 Today, the number of wild boar raids has come down drastically. “I used to spot wild boars in my farm every day. After setting up fence with colourful saris around the farm boundary, they haven’t entered my land,” said T Kanagavel, a farmer.
