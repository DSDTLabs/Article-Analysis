CHANDIGARH: An Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) delegation, led by Haryana leader of Opposition Abhay Singh Chautala, met Union water resources minister   on Monday to impress upon him early completion of Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal according to the   directions to the Centre. 

 They also requested him to urge the Haryana BJP government to follow the SC directive regarding compensation to farmers whose land was to be acquired for Dadupur-Nalvi canal and continue with the project.
 
 The delegation told the Union minister that even as the primary objective of both the SYL and the Dadupur-Nalvi canals was irrigation, the secondary aim of recharging groundwater was equally important. 
 
 “The SC has accepted that   is the life-line of the state and the country suffers huge annual losses in agricultural production when the state is deprived of its legitimate share of river waters. But apart from this, the demographic pressures of the past few decades have also thrown up new challenges that need to be urgently addressed,” said Chautala.
 
 He drew attention of the Union minister to the fast depleting groundwater. South Haryana has already become a ‘dark zone’ and a worried SC has put restrictions on construction. North Haryana, which exports Basmati worth crores of rupees annually, too, has slipped in the ‘critical’ zone. With drinking water shortage, the possibility of rising unemployment, frustration and hence, crime became high, they added.
 
 The Ellenabad MLA said that since a large part of the   (NCR) fell in Haryana, the effects of unemployment and crime would also be felt by it. 
 
 The Union minister said that he would look into the matter and find a solution to it. Besides Abhay Chautala, other members of the delegation included Hisar MP Dushyant Chautala, state INLD president Ashok Arora, party secretary R S Chowdhry and Rampal Majra.
