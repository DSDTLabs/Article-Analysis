BENGALURU:   has severely impacted the residential real estate market of Bengaluru with sales and new launches plummeting to record lows in the recently concluded quarter, according to a report from independent property consultancy  .

 Sales fell by 45% to 7,175 units for the quarter ended December, compared to 13,134 units during the third quarter of last year. New launches also plunged by 31% to 5,454 units in the same period. “After observing a peak in 2013, in the last two years, the city has come under considerable pressure. While launches were already on a decline, owing to factors such as the increasing unsold inventory in the city and BBMP's drive to confront the encroachment of lake beds, issues like the announcement of demonetisation in Q4 2016 further led to curbing of new launches,“ Satish B N, south India executive director of Knight Frank, said on Tuesday .
 
 Sobha Group said it sold just 0.61 million square feet residential space in the last quarter, compared to 0.8 million in the year earlier quarter. Total sales value dropped 28% to Rs 373.2 crore, the company said in a filing with the BSE.
 
 “The real estate sector was beginning to show a clear sign of improvement but got impacted post announcement of demonetisation,“ Sobha managing director J C Sharma said.
 
 The uncertainty is likely to continue during the current quarter, with Knight Frank estimating a loss of Rs 250 crore in stamp duty for the Karnataka government.
 
 Property developers say launches will dry up further this year as the implementation of the RERA ( ) and GST will push out insignificant players out of the market. This, they say , will eventually lead to a rise in price.
 
 Most of the builders in Bengaluru are expected to report a weak quarter, hurt by the government's move to make Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes illegal, which prompted customers to defer their purchases.
