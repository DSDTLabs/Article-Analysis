THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Reiterating his concerns over the move by the State Bank of India (SBI) to introduce new service charges, finance minister   told the assembly on Friday that it will have a severe impact on the   as it would destroy the trust people have on the banking system. Replying to a joint submission moved by members from both treasury and opposition benches against 'fleecing of customers by the SBI', Isaac said the government would raise its worries before the Union government and the SLBC (state level bankers committee). 

 "Due to the banking charges, people are now keeping their cash in hand, which is leading to currency shortage just like what happened post-demonetisation. If the SBI, which holds one-fourth of the market share, loses its credibility, the economic impact will be severe," he said.
 
 The new charges were for recapitalising its huge non-performing assets, which stood at Rs 1.6 lakh crore (out of the total Rs 6.7 lakh crore in the banking sector), the minister said. "Loans to corporates account for a major chunk of the  . It is pulling down the bank's share value and foreign agencies are putting pressure on the bank for recapitalisation," he said. The minister also said the move by the SBI would invariably nudge other banks to follow suit. 
 
  state president  , meanwhile, said the BJP did not have any obligation to blindly support or justify the SBI when it indulges in wrong doings. 
 
 "The Union government policy is to widen the base of the banking sector. Banks like the SBI should focus more on public welfare than on profit-making," he said.
