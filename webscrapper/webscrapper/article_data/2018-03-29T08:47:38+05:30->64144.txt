 Additional metropolitan commissioner Sanjay Kandhare said, "We will decided the date after a report is submitted by Garg."
 
 MMRDA will appoint a new operator as its contract with L&T and   expired in 2014.
 
 MMRDA received bids from   and IL&FS but they will be officially opened on Wednesday.
 
 MMRDA had received a poor response for its operations and maintenance bids. It also had to relax conditions to attract more bidders as only   had evinced interest. MMRDA floated a short tender notice on March 3 to attract more bidders.
 
 MMRDA expects around 2 lakh commuters a day once the entire stretch is operational. The 8.8km phase I had a daily ridership of Rs 15,000.
