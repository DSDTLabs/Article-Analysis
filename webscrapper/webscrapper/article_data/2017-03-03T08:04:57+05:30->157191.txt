HYDERABAD: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( ) is making plans for constructing a new  , a 10 or 12 storied tower that will also house its council hall. It is seeking 5-8 acres of land at  , Adarshnagar.

 The GHMC is considering two options, a single tower with three to four floors or twin towers, one for parking and the other to house the offices on the lines of Hyderabad police commissionerate and integrated police command and control room at Banjara Hills.
 
 Official sources said a plan to open an entrance opposite old Gandhi Medical College on   and constructing a commercial complex adjacent to the road is also being considered. The present six-storied head office near Tank Bund, constructed four decades ago, will be pulled down and in its place will come up a convention hall like Ravindra Bharathi. This plan, officials said, is expected to solve the parking problem in and around Liberty and the space crunch plaguing the GHMC.
 
 GHMC has been scouting for a site for a new headquarters as the existing office at Liberty is inadequate and other GHMC offices are scattered in Khairtabad and Abids. The current office also lacks adequate space for holding large meetings. Corporators are forced to park their vehicles near Lumbini Park complex. Visitors park their vehicles outside the office, choking the road during peak hours.
 
 Highly placed sources said chief minister   is looking into the vastu compliance of the New MLA Quarters site. GHMC commissioner B Janardhan Reddy said the Hyderabad district collector has been asked by the municipal administration minister to prepare an inventory of government land available in the city. Only after that will the government take a view on allocation of land, he said.
