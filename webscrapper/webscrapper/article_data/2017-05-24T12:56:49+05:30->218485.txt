 SURAT:   between   was affected following   of the   (OHE) between  
 
 Sources said that most of the super fast and long distance trains between Mumbai and Surat were running late by almost two hours and that the 
 trains on the UP line were diverted to the Down line.
 
 The incident occurred in the morning hours between Udhana and Surat. The Overhead cable of the OHE broke down, thereby resulting in the railway traffic towards Mumbai coming to a grinding halt.
 
 Most of the trains like Baroda-Bhilad, Karnavati, Double-Dekkar, Shatabdi and Suryanagri Express were halted at Surat, Utran and Udhana stations due to the break down of the OHE. Only down line is running, which has resulted in the slowing down of the railway traffic between Surat and Mumbai.
 
 Official sources said that the railway staff is working continuously to restore the break down of the OHE between Surat and Udhana.
