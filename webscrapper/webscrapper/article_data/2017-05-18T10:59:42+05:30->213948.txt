LUCKNOW: As evening settles over the Nawabi era monuments in the   heritage zone, scores of unregulated   find their way in too. And all that the area is left with by the end of the day is heaps of wrappers and garbage. In the absence of a food court (foundation stone for which was laid in December), the no-vending zone has become a hub for illegal food carts creating chaos and becoming a hazard for the traffic and beauty of the area.

 While   (LMC) officials claim a number of anti-encroachment drives in the area have reaped only monetary benefits, it has passed on the final responsibility of maintaining it on the local police. “I have conducted several drives in the past with the police’s support but once it is done, the police does not maintain it and the illegal stalls come up again. The entire area is unregulated and with no tickets for coming to the area, it has become a massive heap of dump,” said  , LMC zonal incharge of the area. 
 
 Rizvi also claimed that she had also written to the inspector incharge of the   police station about the repeated drives and the police support to illegal vendors. She said another drive will be conducted in the coming week to rid the area of the black spots. According to LMC officials, collection of garbage from the area every morning is a massive task with the dump being equivalent to that of a month’s garbage from other areas. 
 
 Not just that, with illegal food stalls also comes the problem of traffic regulation in the area. As vehicles come to visit food stalls, the traffic comes to a crawl because of chaotic parking. It was only recently that the state government approved of a new vending policy to regulate vendors and control the menace. As per the policy, committees, both at the state and district level, will be formed with members from police, local municipal corporation and even vendors to decide on fixed vendor spots in different parts of cities.
