Chandigarh: The Chandigarh district court granted bail to Jagjeet Singh, joint director of the technical education and industrial training wing of the Punjab government on Tuesday after he furnished bail bonds of Rs 50,000. 

 He was arrested for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 50,000 in February. The Special Court of CBI granted him bail.
 
 The Central Bureau of Investigation arrested him in Chandigarh for demanding and accepting a Rs 50,000 bribe from the complainant. A case was registered against him under Section 7 of the PC Act, 1988.
 
 The complainant alleged that two officials visited his institute (ITI) and told him they had been directed to inspect the institute on a complaint alleging it was being run without proper lab equipment, that it was charging fee from students of reserved category, had also given admission to students who did not attend class and had only 10% attendance.
 
 The department also issued a show-cause notice for de-affiliation of the institute. The complainant visited the office and met the joint director, who, after having a conversation with the complainant, allegedly told him that he would get his institute de-affiliated unless a Rs 50,000 was paid. 
 
 The CBI laid a trap and caught the joint director red-handed demanding and accepting the bribe from the complainant. Searches were conducted at the office and residence of the accused.
