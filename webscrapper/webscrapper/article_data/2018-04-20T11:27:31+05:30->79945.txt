PUNE: In an effort to create skilled manpower in the automobile industry, the   ( ) will soon establish a joint training institute for skill development. 

 While the plan is at a very nascent stage, talks are underway regarding affiliation with the institute and apex bodies in India and Germany, stated IGCC director Bernhard Steinruecke while speaking at a function held on Thursday to celebrate the chamber’s decade-long presence in Pune.
 
 IGCC delegates gave presentations about some project that are currently running in India as well as revealed their plans for future cooperation. Apart from Steinruecke, IGCC president Thomas Fuhrmann, Consul General Jurgen Morhard, Force Motors chief Abhay Firodia and IGCC regional director Natascha Lewandowski participated in the celebrations.
 
 Steinruecke said, “The German system of dual vocational education and training (VET) has grown and proven to be successful. It is perfectly placed to bridge the gap between the increasing need for theoretical knowledge and real world application of the skills. Considering the success of the past project, a joint training institute for skill development has been planned.”
 
 IGCC conducted a pilot course in metal working early in 2015 together with school partner   in Pune. The course showed positive results in terms of progress in trainees’ learning and feedback from participating companies.
 
 Later, several companies requested IGCC to extend the course and develop a year-long training session for industry mechanics. The training course, which started in November 2015, enables participants to focus on practical skills and applications, get shop floor experience and join the working world immediately after graduation.
 
 The project is sponsored by the   and coordinated by the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce.
