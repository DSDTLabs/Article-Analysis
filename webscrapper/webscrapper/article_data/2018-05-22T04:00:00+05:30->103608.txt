Surat: Police arrested four persons in connection with the murder of a 24-year-old man who was beaten to death for asking the accused to vacate the forecourt of his house on Sunday night. 

 Family members and local residents made a representation to city police commissioner Satish Sharma about the lackadaisical attitude of cops in controlling notorious persons in the area.
 
 Dinesh Kalu Kachhava, a labourer, was thrashed to death by seven people outside his house. Kachhava had asked the accused to vacate the forecourt of his house which made them furious. The accused were using foul language which compelled Kachhava to ask them to leave.
