Vadodara: The Gujarat State Eligibility Test (GSET) which is conducted for determining eligibility for lectureship in universities and colleges of Gujarat will be held on September 30.  MSU which is the nodal agency for conducting GSET in the state has decided to hold the examination as per the new guidelines of the University Grants Commission (UGC).  Unlike last year, when the exam was conducted at six centres across the state, this year, the 13th GSET will be conducted at 11 centres.  “Looking at the incremental rate of candidates registering and appearing for the test and to ensure that such candidates don’t face problems, we have decided to add five more centres including Valsad, Vallabh Vidyanagar, Godhra, Jamnagar and Bhuj,” said professor C N Murthy, member secretary of GSET. For the 12th GSET which was conducted in August last year, around 25,000 candidates had registered. This year, as the registrations have started on website, around 20,000 candidates have already registered.  “We are expecting 10 % increase in number of candidates appearing for the test,” he said, adding that as per a policy decision taken last year, toppers of all the 23 individual subjects will be felicitated in the coming days.  “Till last year, the examination was held in the format of paper I, II and III in which paper I was related to general research aptitude whereas paper II and paper III were subject specific,” he said.  “Now, UGC has decided to merge paper II and paper III and hence there will be only one subject-specific paper which will be of 100 questions each carrying two marks,” he said.  “Paper I which was previously of 60 questions will be now of 50 questions. But unlike past, when candidates had to answer 50 out of 60 questions, candidates will now have to answer all the questions,” he said, adding that the total marks for paper will be 100.  “All the candidates will have to pass both the papers individually in order to become eligible,” he added.
