Actor   says that he has spent a lot of his career making "excuses" for the "absurdity" of  .

 
  
 According to a report, Gyllenhall said, "You know, you think about   -- I've had people come up to me over the years and say how that movie changed their life or how it made them realise something -- and you see the power of movies".
 
 "I have spent a lot of time in my career making excuses for the absurdity of our world -- Hollywood -- and all of its confusion, apparent sickness over the past few months that we've discovered, the complications, the vanity."
 
 "But what I will never accept is anyone telling me that movies aren't an extraordinarily powerful tool for communication and ultimately, in a small way, for change. And sometimes in a big way," he added.
 
 Gyllenhaal's comments come after more than 300 Hollywood actresses, writers and directors including  ,  ,  ,   and   launched a campaign 'Time's Up' to help fight sexual harassment in the film industry and other workplaces.
