BENGALURU: Ballistics experts analyzing the bullet cartridges recovered from the spot where an   president was attacked last week said country-made pistols were used by the culprits. The use of firearms in gang wars is not rare in Bengaluru. A rowdysheeter was shot dead by his rivals in   last June. 

 Most underworld elements use country-made weapons, which are manufactured in north India. With a pistol costing Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000, many rowdies go gun shopping, say cops.
 
 As per the Union home ministry records, 362 unlicensed,   were seized in Karnataka in 2014 and 2015. However, these were just the weapons recovered by police, and the total number of similar firearms in the city, say cops, could be more.
 
 The drop in the number of seized firearms too is a cause for worry for police. While 278 illegal, country-made weapons were seized in 2014, the number dipped to 84 in 2015. The figure took Karnataka, which once occupied the first spot in terms of the number of illegal arms seized in south India, to the fourth position. 
 
 Cops, however, say interrogation of the arrested persons revealed there is more demand for ammunition than guns. Figures confirm this. In 2014, 122 bullets were recovered, but in 2015 more than 719 bullets were seized.
