PATNA: With the   pleading ignorance about any special package to Bihar in response to an RTI query, the state’s ruling JD (U) on Thursday assailed PM   for “falsely” promising Rs 1.25 lakh crore to the state during the 2015 assembly election.
 
  “Just before the announcement of assembly election, the PM at a government function at Ara announced a special package of Rs 1.25 lakh crore for the state. Now, the Niti Aayog says its financial resource division does not have any information about such a package. The Niti Aayog said this in response to an RTI application filed by one Md Iqbal Ansari on April 12, 2017,” said JD (U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan.
  
  Ranjan along with party MLC  , known for his proximity with CM  , was addressing a press conference in Patna.
  
  Neeraj said the Niti Aayog’s clarification came almost two years after the PM’s announcement. “It will not be wrong to call it a political scam perpetrated by Modi who is more of a poster boy than someone helming the world’s largest democracy,” said Neeraj.
  
  They demanded that the Centre should immediately make it clear whether or not it intended to help Bihar progress.
  
  Neeraj also flayed the Union ministers from Bihar for allegedly doing nothing to ensure that the state got what the PM promised. “These Union ministers are behaving like the PM’s ‘press boys’, only making statements at press conferences and public meetings to mislead innocent people,” he said.
