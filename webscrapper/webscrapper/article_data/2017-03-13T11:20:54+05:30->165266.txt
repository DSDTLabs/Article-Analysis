NEW DELHI: The BJP parliamentary board on Sunday authorised party chief   to select the 
  and Uttarakahand.

 Shah is likely to announce his choices based on the 
  to sound out party MLAs. For all practical purposes, Shah along with PM Modi, will decide who will be 
  and 
  .
 
 The authorisation mirrors Shah’s heft as the powerful chief of the ruling party and confirms his newly-acquired stature as de facto No. 2 in the saffron power structure. The parliamentary board, the party’s top decision-making body, did not consider the leadership issue in detail beyond the decision to send observers to states who will submit their reports to Shah.
 
 "Amit Shahji has been authorised by the parliamentary board to make a final decision as per the report of the observers," senior party leader J P Nadda said after the meeting.
 
 Importantly, Shah called on Union home minister  , seen as one of the possibilities for UP CM, to discuss the appointment of CMs for the two states.There was no addition to the list of probables for the UP top job.
 
 Singh, BJP state chief Keshav Maurya, Union minister Manoj Sinha and   are said to be in the race.
 
 
  include former Congress leader Satpal Maharaj, Prakash Pant and Devendra Rawat. It seems clear that former chief ministers like BC Khanduri, Bhagat Singh Koshiyari and Ramesh Pokhriyal are not in the running. The party seems to have decided to opt for a fresh face.
 
 The party later announced Venkaiah Naidu and Bhupendra Yadav as observers for UP, and Narendra Tomar and Saroj Pandey for Uttarakhand. The observers will visit the two states on March 16. Piyush Goyal and Vinay Sahasrabuddhe are observers for Manipur.
