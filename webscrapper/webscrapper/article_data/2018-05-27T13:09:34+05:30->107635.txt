  : About 120 kg of plastic waste, comprising mostly wrappers, packets, and bottles, was collected from 10 locations here under the   Clean-Up initiative on Saturday. 

 Taking part in the programme, health and environment minister   collected plastic waste littered on the streets, market backyards, drains for two hours. Addressing a gathering,   called upon people to reduce use of plastic items which, he said, is destroying our eco-friendly culture of carrying things in jute bags. "We are leaving behind healthy and eco-friendly habits. The natural mineral water has been replaced with added mineral water bottles. Meal plates made of banana and saal leaves are being replaced by plates. Almost 98% of things needed in a middle-class family are now packed in plastic," Roy Barman said.
