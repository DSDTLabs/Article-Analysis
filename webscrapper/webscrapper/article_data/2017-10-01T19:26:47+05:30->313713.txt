BHOPAL: A 32-year old debt-ridden farmer hanged himself to death in Sehore district early on Sunday. From June 6, when six protesting farmers were killed in police firing in Mandsaur district, around a dozen farmers have committed suicide in the district, till date.

 The farmer was identified as Bane Singh  , 32, resident of Dhabla village under   police station. He went to his farm and hanged himself to a tree. 
 
 Parmar owned around 10 acre of land and had cultivated Soyabean on it, but due to the low rainfall the entire crop was damaged and the total output in his farms was only 5 quintals, said sources. 
 
 He had also taken loans from the local bank as well as private money lenders and was under pressure of repayment and the crop damage added to his miseries, it is probably this reason that triggered his suicide, added sources. 
 
 The deceased farmer is survived by his wife and two children aged 8 and 10 years, sources said. 
 
 “We received information that a farmer had committed suicide at around 11 am. We rushed to spot and the body was sent for post-mortem and later handed over to the kin. As the family was grief stricken their statements could not be recorded till now. Locals were claiming that he was under debt and his crops were damaged. But this will only be clear once we are able to record statements of the kin. Whether he was under debt, if yes from where and whether this triggered the incident will only be clear after the investigations are over,” Bilkisganj police station incharge, Suresh Meena told TOI.
 
 Earlier farmers   of Budhni, Banshilal of Jamunia Khurd village, Dulichand Keer of Jajna village, Mukesh Yadav of Nasrullahganj, Mariya Barela of Bilkisganj, Babulal of Palkhedi, Vijay Singh of Icchhawar,   of Patharia were among the farmers of Sehore who have committed suicide after June 6 incident, said sources.
