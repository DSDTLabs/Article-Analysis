Few can challenge the strength of skipper Virat Kohli’s fan-base. What if we told you that his fan-base includes Varun Dhawan? Yes, the actor is a die-hard fan of the captain of the Indian cricket team and his feelings extend to his reel life character too. So much so that Varun went ahead and got his mane styled exactly like Virat Kohli for 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania'. Talking to BT about this, Varun said, “When we started shooting for 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania', I asked my director Shashank (Khaitan), ‘Badrinath kiska fan hai? Who does my character look up to?’ He said, “Tu Virat Kohli ka fan hai. Today, every child in our country is a Kohli fan. I quickly called my hairstylist and told him, ‘I want a haircut like Virat’. Coincidentally, Virat was in his salon for a haircut too. I dropped everything, and told him, ‘I am coming there right now’. I wanted the same look as VK’s. And then, we sat on chairs next to each other at the salon and got the same hairdo.” 
	


 That’s some real sporting spirit from Virat, though we wonder he thought about Varun’s idea? “He was quite amused at my thought of imitating his hair cut,” says the actor, laughing. He adds, “I know him from before. We were a part of the same football club. He started teasing me, ‘Main haircut badal doonga teri film release hone se pehle.’ Films take a while to get made. Over these months, every now and then, I had a message from him saying that he’s changing his look.’ When asked if cricket’s poster boy is keenly waiting to see his fan boy on screen, Varun beams, “I’d love to show the film to Virat.” Let’s hope VK is bowled over by VD fanboying over him.
