Bengaluru: It’s been a year since segregation of waste at source was made mandatory by BBMP, but only five of the city’s 198 wards have managed to achieve segregation levels higher than 80%. 

 Shockingly, across 16 wards, the figure continues to be below 25%, while 79 score between 50% and 80% and 98 show 25%-50% achievement. 
 
 According to data compiled by BBMP for the 2018 Swachh Survekshan, Doddabommasandra is the top performer, achieving 91% segregation, followed by wards like HSR Layout (85%), Kuvempunagar (85%), RK Temple (83%) and Sanjaynagar (80%).
 
 Wards in Gandhinagar and Pulakeshinagar assembly constituencies have fared the worst with 23% and 12% respectively.
 
 “Wards with higher levels of segregation such as Doddabommasandra and HSR Layout, have traditionally had strong and active citizen groups which monitor the waste collection process. In Doddabommasandra for instance, there are 4-5 master trainers who have been working very hard. In Gandhinagar, however, things are not so simple as it is a largely commercial area and has a floating population, especially around the train and bus stations. In Pulakeshinagar, officials are not doing what they are supposed to do,” said Sandya Narayan, member of the Solid Waste Management Round Table (SWMRT).
 
 The disparity between wards indicates that the Palike’s SWM plans should be tailored to suit the needs of each ward, something Sandya agrees with. “Each ward has its own peculiarities and a different demographic. Hence, it needs a specialized plan. But it can be formulated and implemented only if all the stakeholders, including ward committees, come together,” she said.
 
 Attributing higher segregation levels to increased involvement of citizens and BBMP officials, Ramprasad V, solid waste management expert, said, “The best practices that are successful in some wards should be replicated in the others.”
 
 Stating that they will intensify their focus on the problem areas, Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner, health and solid waste management, said, “In areas like Gandhinagar where there are smaller commercial pockets, the percentage tends to be lower. We will conduct a special drive for pourakarmikas, so that they learn not to pick up mixed waste. We will also improve our fining system; if we fine violators every time they generate mixed waste, they may be encouraged to segregate it.”
