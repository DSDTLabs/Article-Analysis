MUMBAI: The   (ED) on Wednesday said one of the reasons why a non-bailable warrant must be issued against controversial Islamic preacher   is that as a founder of  , he was "directly involved in activities of funding and provocative speeches". 

 Making the submissions before a special court that hears cases under Prevention of   Act, ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar said, "The Government of India has banned the organization in 2016 and the   (NIA) lodged its prosecution against him under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act." 
 
 "As the foundation is illegal and against the interests of the country and social and communal harmony, funds its receives from India and abroad are tainted," said Venegaonkar. "Companies were used to camouflage diversion of funds received by Dr Zakir Naik through his illegal activities of provocative speeches," said the ED application.
 
 While the ED concluded its submissions, Naik's lawyer Taraq Sayed requested special Judge P R Bhavke that he be heard before any orders are passed on Thursday.
