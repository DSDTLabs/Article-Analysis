LUDHIANA: Following the long-pending demand of the TET (Teachers Eligibility Test) Pass ETT (Elementary Teacher Training) Teachers’ Union, a state-level meeting was being organized by its members in the   here on Sunday. During this meeting, members had discussed further strategies on how to deal with the Captain Amarinder Singh-led   government, if they did not soon fulfil their long-pending demand for recruitment of 130 TET-pass teachers (belonging to backward classes) in the education department in the coming days.

 Members of the teachers’ union have decided to hold a mass agitation in Captain Amarinder Singh’s constituency in mid-April to wake up the Congress government to fulfil their demand, which the Congress itself had made their pre-poll promise at election time last year.
 
 Amarjit  , president of the teachers’ union — while addressing the media gathering — stated that the newly introduced policy of the state education department to transfer every teacher after three years is totally against the teaching staff, as it led to mental harassment. “How can teachers manage to shift their base every third year across the state? We urge the authorities to roll back their decision as early as possible,” he said.
 
 Amarjit added: “Even though some members of our teachers’ union are facing legal action because police had registered some FIRs while they were protesting against the state government policies in a recent protest march, we are requesting the state government once again to cancel all old cases, otherwise union members will be forced to come on the roads to seek the fulfilment of their demands.”
 
 Deepak Kumar, another member of the teachers’ union, stated: “We have decided 22 April as the date for a mass protest in Patiala, following which we will carry out a march to gherao the   in Patiala — Captain Amarinder Singh’s constituency — in order to make our voices heard on a priority basis.”
