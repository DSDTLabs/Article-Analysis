CHENNAI: The   accurately captures the   towards   for public use.

 In the 20th year of its commissioning, the subway stands severely damaged causing accidents involving two-wheelers. Potholes nearly a feet deep have developed due to years of being continuously pounded by rainfall.
 
 TOI visited the spot on Sunday and found craters in the middle of the subway. In the event of rainfall, chances of accidents double as craters get submerged, said N Goutham, a local resident.
 
 But the state highways department’s solution for the crisis is laughable at best. Brick debris is constantly dumped to fill up potholes which, according to the department’s admission, suffer from seepage issues. On Monday, the department repeated the endeavour.
 
 Recently, the   relaid the motorable surface of the Aranganathan subway. When a senior highways department official was asked as to why re-laying was not being pursued for Pazhavanthangal subway, he said, “Once we dig out the terrain, the velocity of seeping water will make work impossible. Replacing the cement blocks is the only solution, however, currently we have no plans for it.”
 
 The subway, constructed at a cost of Rs 3.84 crore, was opened in 1997. It is a crucial bit of infrastructure as it connects burgeoning Pazhavanthangal and Nanganallur localities with the arterial GST Road.
