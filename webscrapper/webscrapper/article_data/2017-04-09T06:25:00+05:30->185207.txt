DUMKA:   (VVPAT) will be used at all booths in   assembly constituency for the by-election on Sunday. While VVPAT was used at a few model booths in eight constituencies in Jharkhand during the 2014 assembly election, this is for the first time the system will be used for all the 272 booths under the  .

 More than 1.9 lakh people are eligible to vote in the Littipara constituency, which has 10 candidates in the fray. The constituency has more women voters — 96,214 — than men (93,915).
 
 With Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, the main opposition party in the state, approaching the   against the supply of the electronic voting machines (EVMs) used in the recent Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in Littipara, the use of VVPAT is expected to boost the confidence of the voters in a free and fair election.
 
 “VVPAT contains names of candidates and symbols of political parties and independent candidates. The system will assure people that their votes are recorded in the EVM as intended,” Dumka deputy commissioner Rahul Kumar Sinha said. “With VVPAT being used, the number of polling staff has been increased from previous four to five in each booth,” he said.
 
 Sinha was briefing the media about the administrative arrangements for polling on Sunday in the 40 booths under Gopikandar block of the district. He added that officials were dispatched with elaborate security arrangements for conducting the election in the 40 booths on Saturday.
 
 Elaborate security arrangements have been made for the safety of the voters and the polling staff, considering the violence triggered during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, when Maoist rebels had ambushed a polling party in Shikaripara (Dumka) killing eight, including five policemen. A large contingent of paramilitary forces have been heavily deployed in the entire constituency and all entry and exit points are being monitored.
