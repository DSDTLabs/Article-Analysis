PANAJI: Power consumers, both domestic as well as industrial, in the state will again have to prepare themselves to shell out more to pay their February, March and April   bills, following a second revision in the fuel and power purchase cost adjustment ( ) in six months. 

 Compared to the FPPCA in the last quarter, the rise in the FPPCA is between 13 to 15%, with consumers having to shell out between 4 paisa to 23 paisa more for every unit of power consumed. 
 
 The low tension commercial category of 0-100 units as well as the low tension industry category of above 500 units have seen the smallest increase of 13.1% followed closely by the high tension defence establishments category where the FPPCA has risen by 13.3%.
 
 The highest increase in FPPCA across all categories has been levied on domestic and non-commercial consumers the in three categories of 101-200 units, 301-400 units and above 400 units, where it is 15%. 
 
 The new FPPCA charges will be levied for January, February and March, to be billed in February, March and April respectively.
 
 The low income group category as well as high tension agriculture and low tension agriculture categories arenâ€™t affected by the revision in FPPCA.
 
 The joint electricity regulatory commission (JERC) allows the Goa electricity department to recover the amount paid to power suppliers through FPPCA charges. Every quarter, bulk power purchase cost is computed and anything that goes above or below the approved cost is recovered from the consumers or refunded to them. The entire process is based on   regulation and formula and is a routine practice followed by the department since 2012. 
 
 While the last quarter also saw a rise in FPPCA, the quarter before that was a relief for consumers who actually received a credit in their August, September and October bills.
