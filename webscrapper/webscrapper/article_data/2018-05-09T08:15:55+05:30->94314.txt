BENGALURU: When former India skipper and current U-19 and India ‘A’ head coach Rahul Dravid takes the ‘A’ teams for the one-day triangular series and four-day games to England next month, a few from the squad will look to make a statement, since the senior team will be playing a five-match Test series there starting August 1.

 
 
 
 On Tuesday, Dravid was keenly involved in handpicking the two squads and most of the domestic and IPL performers have been rewarded. The limited-overs team, which will play in a triangular series with West Indies and England Lions, will be led by Mumbaikar Shreyas Iyer. Karnataka’s   will lead the team in the two-match four-day fixtures. Domestic season’s highest run-getter Mayank Agarwal will feature in both the teams, as will Prithvi Shaw and Hanuma Vihari.
 
 Test match prospects Murali Vijay, KL Rahul, R Ashwin, Wriddhiman Saha and Mohammed Shami will join the India ‘A’ team for the last four-day game, against England Lions starting on July 16.
 
 “We have not left any performer out. Domestic performances have been given due importance. At the same time, those doing well in India ‘A’ and Indian teams are continuing in their places,” explained chief selector MSK Prasad.
 
 Prasad also pointed out that the tour will be crucial for Mayank, who many thought would make the India team when a secondstring outfit was sent to Sri Lanka for the Nidahas T20 tri-series. “The series in England should tell us where he (Mayank) stands when it comes to getting runs at that standard. We are confident that he will do well. So he figures in both formats.” Among the surprise picks in the limited overs team are Khaleel Ahmed and Prasidh Krishna.
