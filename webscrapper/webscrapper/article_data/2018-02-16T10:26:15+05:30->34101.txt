CHANDIGARH: Hanging wires, open electric junction boxes, dumped furniture and waste material on the premises of   civil secretariat have been posing a serious threat to the building and the visitors alike. Now, the fire and emergency wing of the Chandigarh municipal corporation will conduct fresh inspections of the entire building and prepare a report keeping all the safety measures in the mind.

 “During the operation to douse the fire on Thursday, we witnessed the area had several hanging wires that can prove to be dangerous due to heavy footfall in the government building. Moreover, the office concerned needs to constitute a committee to auction the dumped waste material that caused the fire on Thursday. Even after the fire incident, there is unused material lying is dumped in the building and it can lwad to similar incidents in the future,” said an official of the municipal corporation.
 
 “We were surprised to see the amount of waste material dumped there and the same has reportedly been lying there from the past many years. The people there told us that any unused material is dumped in the open and since there no proper process to either auction or dispose off the unused material, the authorities concerned could not do anything in this regard,” said another senior MC officer.
 
 The TOI team on Thursday also visited the record room situated adjoining the area where the fire had broken out. Files in the record room have been kept in open almirahs and in case any fire breaks out, the entire record could be damaged and also fuel the fire further.
 
 Since the   and Haryana secretariat is also a  , its conservation plan is being prepared and fire safety is one of the crucial component there. 
 
 The Chandigarh administration has already allotted a portion of the building for revamp.
