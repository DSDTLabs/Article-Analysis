CHENNAI: After several delays, Krishna water from   is finally set to reach the city on Thursday, said PWD officials. On Wednesday, the inflow from the   reservoir in AP was at the interstate border. “There is another 4km to go before the water enters   at the zero point in Uthukottai.From Uthukottai, it will travel another 25km before entering   ­ one of the four city reservoirs.

 Krishna water stored in the Kandaleru reservoir which was released 10 days ago underwent several delays before reaching the TN-AP border on Wednesday night. A PWD official said, “We will get at least 1 TMC (equivalent to one month's supply) from Krishna river.“ Kandaleru reservoir released 1180 cusecs (33,400 litres per second) on January 9, but the flow of water was affected due to illegal tapping by villagers living along the 152km KandaleruPoondi canal.
 
 PWD officials said they expect the rate of flow to reduce by the time it arrives at the Poondi reservoir.
