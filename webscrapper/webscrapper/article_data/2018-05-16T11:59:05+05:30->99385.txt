LUDHIANA: As plans are afoot to shift the Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Inter-State  , the city   service will play a crucial role in ferrying commuters. The shifting of the bus stand can prove to be a boon for the bus service, because more people will rely on public transport to reach the bus stand. Initially, authorities were planning to make arrangements for all buses in the grain market near  , except those moving to and from Ferozepur. Officials will also visit the grain market site on Wednesday to take a final decision.

 A meeting was conducted on Tuesday by deputy commissioner Pradeep Aggarwal with the bus stand authorities, city bus service officials, and other officials concerned. The city bus service is being managed by a private transport company, and even they are ready to increase the number of buses on Jalandhar Bypass route for public convenience. At present, 18 buses are plying on this route, and there are plans to add 12 more.
 
 In the meeting, it was discussed that around 700 buses go to Ferozepur from the bus stand, and these buses will continue on the existing route, but all other buses will be terminated at the grain market. There is also a plan to divide the load of buses from one bus stand to four. This shifting to the grain market will also be a trial run to see if the scheme is successful.
 
 Meanwhile,   manager Baljit Singh said they were ready to increase the number of buses on the required routes, and it would be beneficial for the bus service as well. He said they were looking forward to expand the service.
 
 Notably, the aim behind this exercise is to reduce the burden on the inner city, especially in the wake of non-functional bridges. After the retaining wall of Gill Chowk Flyover collapsed, the bridge is closed for public, and it might take at least a month to repair it. Traffic police are also diverting heavy vehicles from Atam Nagar towards Dugri Road and Partap Chowk to reach Delhi Road.
