LUCKNOW: People might have to pay a fine of Rs 1,000 if they do not have a pollution-free certificate for their vehicle. The   ( ) is a proof that your vehicle is not polluting the environment. 

 Given poor air quality index in Lucknow, Allahabad and Kanpur, the   appointed Committee on Road Safety has written to the transport department to crackdown on vehicles without PUCC.
 
 One of the reasons for poor execution of the rule is that the transport department does not conduct specific drive against polluting vehicles. The last such drive was conducted in January 2016.
 
 “The committee has asked the department to create awareness on PUCC and tell people that it’s an offence to not possess the certificate,” said transport department sources. 
 
 A PUCC is valid for six months and is issued by petrol pumps and agencies authorised by the transport department. In Lucknow, at least 100 agencies have been authorised to issue the certificate. 
 
 All commercial and private vehicles without PUCC will be challaned and seized. Directions been issued to field officers to act against polluting vehicles in the Road Safety Week starting from January 9, said sources. 
 
 Criterion for PUCC: 
 
 Pollutants emitted by a petrol engine include oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur, along with hydrocarbons and lead. The quantity of carbon monoxide (CO) in the smoke emitted by a vehicle is checked for issuing PUCC. If the smoke is less than 3% CO concentration, the vehicle is considered non-polluting and issued a PUCC. In case of diesel vehicles, smoke density is checked for pollution. If smoke density by a vehicle is less than 65 Hartridge   (HSU), PUCC is issued. While ‘0’ HSU means smoke is invisible, 100 HSU means smoke is thick and opaque.
