AHMEDABAD: The raid by the state monitoring cell (SMC), working directly under the state DGP, earlier this week at a   at Madhavpura has already cost a police inspector his job. More such raids are making the city cops wary as it may spell trouble for erring officials. They are now carrying out raids on gambling dens. 

  On Sunday, a team raided a spot in Sardarnagar and seized two scooters used for ferrying Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL). Search at the spot fetched   bottles worth Rs 1.12 lakh. The team has registered a complaint with Sardarnagar police for the find and have named Shashi Parmar, a resident of Mahajaniyavas, Kubernagar, as the accused in the case. 
 
 The SMC officials said that Shashi’s father and mother have been sent to prison under PASA provisions multiple times for violation of prohibition laws. Shashi has also been caught eight times for the same offence in the past four years.
 
 Soon after, the city police’s Prevention of Crime Branch ( ) raided gambling dens in Jehangir ni Chali near Shahibaug and Juna Medawali Chali in Rakhial, whereas the city crime branch raided a den in Sardarnagar and caught 20 persons for gambling. Danilimda police also conducted a raid on a gambling den on Saturday night.
 
 “With stringent prohibition laws in place and the SMC active to respond to information from across the state, it will surely compel the city police to up their act. The city police commissioner has also made it clear that he will not tolerate the illegal activities. Madhavpura police inspector M B Khileri was suspended after the SMC raid found a gambling den active in his area. It has triggered continuous raids and search operations by police stations and agencies like the PCB,” said a source.
 
 The sources said it was now to be seen as to how these raids would improve the law and order situation.
