Ludhiana: A local court has sentenced a student from Jharkhand to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for smuggling opium. Special court judge Virinder Aggarwal also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh, and in default of payment, he will have to undergo rigorous imprisonment for another two years.

 On 12 July 2017, Government Railway Police (GRP) had booked Aditya Kumar of Chatra district in Jharkhand under Section 18 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, after he was found in conscious possession of 2kg and 600g of opium.
 
 As per prosecution, on 12 July last year, assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Ram Kishan, the investigating officer — along with other police officials — was checking for suspects near the office of Railway Mail Service (RMS), Ludhiana railway station. During checking, the GRP team saw one person carrying a black colour bag in his right hand, coming from platform number one and going outside. On seeing the police party, the person tried to turn back, and on suspicion, the GRP team apprehended the person. Upon checking his bag, the team recovered 2kg and 600g of opium, after which he was arrested.
 
 GRP later presented a challan against the accused in a court of law. During trial of the case, the accused pleaded innocence and false implication. Additional public prosecutor for the state, SS Haidar, pleaded for punishment to the accused on the basis of prosecution evidence, and Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report. The court, after taking evidence on record, convicted Aditya Kumar.
 
 The convict pleaded for leniency, claiming he was a young student. Taking into consideration all facts and circumstances, and the recovery being commercial in nature, the special court judged sentenced him to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and also imposed a fine on him.
