Madurai: The annual float festival at the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple scheduled on January 31 will be held only during the day this year in view of the lunar eclipse which falls on that day. Meanwhile, the flag was hoisted for the float festival at the temple here on Saturday in a grand ceremony.

 This is one of the important events of the temple, with the float festival being held on the day of Thai Pournami, the full moon day in the month of Thai. On Saturday, thousands of devotees gathered at the temple to witness the flag-hoisting ceremony, which took place at around 11am. The flag was hoisted in the gold flag mast of the temple, to the chanting of hymns by the priests.
 
 During the festival, the deities, Meenakshi and Sundareswarar will be taken on processions on the streets around the temple in the mornings and evenings. People will be able to witness them on all these days.
 
 However, this year, it is expected that there will be a lunar eclipse on the day of the full moon day of the month of Thai, and the deities will have to return to the temple before it. So Meenakshi and Sundareswarar will be brought to the float around 9.30am on January 31 and will be taken back to the temple by 2pm. Hence, the evening float will not be held on that day.
 
 The doors of the temple would be open only between 9pm and 9.45pm on January 31 in view of the lunar eclipse.
