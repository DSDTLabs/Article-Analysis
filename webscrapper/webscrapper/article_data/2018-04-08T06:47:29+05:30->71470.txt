KOLAR: AICC president   on Saturday taunted Prime Minister   for “lacking the guts to face the Congress in Parliament” and using the NDA allies to stall the proceedings in both Houses, which were adjourned sine die without transacting business for 22 days.

 “Modi knows that we’ll tear him to shreds over the banking scams and corruption in his government,’’ he told reporters.
 
 Addressing the last leg of his Janaashirvaada yatra in KGF, Kolar and Chikkaballapur districts, Rahul said: “Time is running out for Modi and his government. The BJP’s decline will start from Karnataka followed by Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Rajasthan. In 2019, we will remove the   from the Centre. Four years ago, people gave Modi a blank cheque hoping that he’ll do good for the country. But, he failed miserably. In return, India got atrocities and oppressions against the poor and Dalits. Now, the mood has changed. India doesn’t trust Modi anymore.”
 
 Rahul said the Congress’s victory in the May 12 polls in Karnataka will mark the beginning of the end of the BJP in 2019. Referring to BJP national president Amit Shah terming the opposition party members “animals”, he said: “There are two non-animals in the country, one is Modi and the other is Shah. Barring them we are all animals. This is disrespectful.” He said both Modi and Shah have sensed the changing mood and they are under pressure.
 
 “One can easily make out that from Modi’s face while Shah is so tensed that he ended up praising Karnataka’s roads as the best in the country at a function in Maharashtra recently. It’s strange but true that the BJP president is campaigning for Congress,” he quipped.
 
 Rahul said he has asked his party leaders nottocriticiseUnion finance minister   who underwent a kidney transplant on Saturday. Returning to Bengaluru late in the evening, Rahul called on Adichunchanagiri mutt seer Swami Nirmalanandanatha in Vijayanagar.
