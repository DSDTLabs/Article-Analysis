VIJAYAWADA: Denizens of   will have to brace for   jams and diversions at   as the   over the busy junction enters a crucial phase.

 Though final plans for traffic diversions are yet to be finalised, it is likely that they will be implemented from the third or fourth week of April. The stakeholders are learnt to be busy preparing proposals for alternative routes that will ensure that traffic management is as smooth as possible.
 
 The contractor tasked with construction of the Benz Circle flyover is asking city police to hand over the junction for erection of two piles. The contractor is also learnt to have requested diversion of the entire traffic from all four sides to alternative routes so as to complete works at a faster pace.
 
 However, city traffic police are undecided over closing off the entire junction. As the NHâ€“16 passes through Benz Circle, it would be difficult for the traffic police to divert the entire traffic to alternative routes. Diverting heavy vehicle traffic from NH-16 is going to be a herculean task for the traffic police. Though diverting Kolkata-bound vehicles onto NH-216 from Ongole is as an option, it would still be difficult for the traffic police to manage Vijayawada-bound vehicles if the roundabout is completely closed.
 
 Benz Circle is the intersection of NH-16 and NH-65 where city traffic from MG Road also merges. This makes it the busiest traffic island in the city. Any obstruction at this point will create traffic   on two national highways as well as on MG Road where numerous commercial establishments are located. Keeping all these points in view, the city police are working out various alternatives to finalise the diversions.
 
 Benz Circle flyover is being constructed on either side of the road. As works were launched on one side of the road, it is learnt that cops are trying to keep the traffic flow open on the other side without obstructing the works.
