 Kher, who turned 62 on Monday, March 7, was ecstatic as he received a birthday wish from   legend Robert De Niro. The actors had shared screen space in David O Russell’s Oscar nominated 2012 romantic comedy, 'Silver Linings Playbook', and since then, haven't lost touch. Kher even hosted   in Mumbai during his last visit when Bollywood's youth brigade queued up to have an audience with him. Last year, Kher had even taken to social media and posted a picture with De Niro, shot at his pad in New York over lunch. Anupam says, “I got a message from   just before the day got over. What can be bigger than that? He signed off by saying ‘Love, Bob’. I felt like I was born all over again.”
