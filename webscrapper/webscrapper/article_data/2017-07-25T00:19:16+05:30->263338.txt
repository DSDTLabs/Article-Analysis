 Ludhiana: Failing to make any headway into the murder of pastor Sultan Masih, the Ludhiana police have announced a cash reward for informers who would provide leads about the killers.
 
 Masih was shot dead by two motorcycle-borne assailants outside ‘Temple of God’ church in Peeru Banda Mohalla of Salem Tabri area on July 14.
 
 The police teams, which have been conducting search operations in different areas to nab the killers, have made announcements among local residents about it.
 
 Though the police commissioner did not disclose the amount of cash reward, sources in the police put the amount at Rs 50 lakh.
 
 A resident of Jagirpur village in Meharban area, where one such search operation was conducted on Saturday, informed, “Besides asking about 6-ft tall men and people having weapons in the locality, the police also announced that the informer who would get Rs 50 lakh and a job.”
 
 Police commissioner R N Dhoke said, “The informer who would provide us important lead or help us nab the killers would be given cash reward.”
 
 However, the top cop did not confirm the amount.
 
 Talking about the investigation, Dhoke said, “A group of people had indulged into a scuffle with the pastor on May 31 on the occasion of silver jubilee of the church. The police have rounded them up and questioning them.”
 
 It is alleged that a group of people had indulged into a tiff with Masih, accusing him of conversion. However, no formal complaint was filed by the pastor in the matter, which was resolved later.
 
 However, now the kin of the priest have alleged that those people could be behind the murder.
 
 Speaking to TOI, pastor’s relative Stephen Sidhu alleged that those 20-25 people who indulged in the scuffle during the silver jubilee function could be behind the crime. They were quite aggressive as allegations on conversion had got wide support on Facebook page ‘No conversion’, which was followed by residents of the Salem Tabri area.
