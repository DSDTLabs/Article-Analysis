PATNA: RJD boss   inadvertently occupied the chair meant for CM   during a programme of   at   hall here on Sunday. However, Lalu immediately vacated the chair for CM and took the next one when one of the organizers pointed it out to him. But the incident left the tongues wagging as Lalu’s RJD and Nitish’s JD(U) are partners in the coalition government in Bihar.

 There were only five chairs on the dais with four already occupied by the dignitaries of Brahma Kumaris while the middle chair was kept vacant for the chief guest (CM). In the meantime, the RJD boss, accompanied by his party MLA Bhola Yadav and former MP Shivanand Tiwari, reached the venue. As Lalu entered the hall, the organizers guided him up to the dais. As only one chair was vacant, Lalu occupied it. Within seconds, the organizers brought two more chairs and the Brahma Kumaris dignitaries were shifted.
 
 It all happened minutes before the CM’s arrival at the venue. The programme was organized to celebrate golden jubilee year of Patna unit of the Prajapita Brahmakumaris Ishwariya Vishwa Vidyalaya, Mount Abu (Rajasthan).
