MUMBAI: Parts of south Mumbai once again faced a   on Tuesday morning. Supply was restored within an hour after complaints from residents, who were inconvenienced.

 A resident from Hughes Road said, “The power cut was at 8.10 am and supply was restored within an hour.” But residents faced hardships due to the humid weather, he said.
 
 Another resident said, “Lifts were shut for nearly an hour and several senior citizens and office-goers were stranded on upper floors. This is the third power   in   in the past month. The last time, a couple had to carry newly-born twins and walk up eight floors as the lifts were not working.” Another resident said, “We hope BEST ensures uninterrupted power supply this summer as the heat is unbearable, and we need to switch on fans and air-conditioners.”
 
 A senior officer from the power supply division said, “The feeder tripped at Cumballa Hill on Tuesday morning due to an underground cable fault. Our teams expedited the process of rectifying the fault and supply was restored in around 50 minutes.”
 
 On Monday evening, the power tripped in the same feeder and nine sub-stations were affected, which resulted in power cuts in several parts. Most of these areas witnessed a power outage for the second time on Tuesday.
 
 Sources said buildings and commercial establishments that faced an outage include those in parts of Cumballa Hill, Pedder Road, Malabar Hill, Kemp’s Corner, Gowalia Tank and Babulnath. Some petrol pumps were also affected.
 
 Due to the power outage, residents also faced a water problem, as they were unable to switch on pumps to supply water to overhead tanks in the morning.
 
 Residents also complained of poor customer care service. “When my neighbours called up a BEST helpline, he was informed that there was a cable fault in Kalbadevi. We learnt from the media that the tripping had occurred at Cumballa Hill,” a resident added.
 
 Last September, there were power cuts in SoBo for two successive days.
