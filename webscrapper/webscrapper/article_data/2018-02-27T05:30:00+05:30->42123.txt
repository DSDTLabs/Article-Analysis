Mysuru: Temples, besides being architectural marvels, also serve as markers of human civilisation, said in-charge vice-chancellor of university of Mysore (UoM) Prof. C Basavaraju here on Monday. “Architecture speaks about human existence, besides depicting the culture and heritage of a civilisation,” said Basavaraju, who is chairing the two-day owkrshop on ‘Architecture and Iconology of Indian Temples’ organised by the department of ancient history and  , UoM, which started on Monday.

 “Temple architecture speaks about the journey of mankind, our traditions and culture. They are an integral part of our society. They need to be studied further, and more research needs to be undertaken in this sphere,” he added.
 
 Lamenting that poor management practices posed a threat to temples, Basavaraju said, “These structures have to be preserved. UoM will help preserve the temples.”
 
 The in-charge director of the department of archaeology and museums Gavisiddaiah opined that students were basing their research on information they gain from other sources, and seldom visit the places their theses are based on. “Students are getting PhDs without visiting the temples. Universities have to compel students to stay near temples on which they are carrying out research,” he said.
 
 Gavisiddaiah bemoaned the failure to realise the proposal to set up an Architecture Research Centre in Karnataka. “Mysuru is the Heritage City, and the research centre should be set up here,” he said.
 
 Former director of the department MS Krishnamurthy, dean of academics at Karnataka State Open University Prabhu were present.
