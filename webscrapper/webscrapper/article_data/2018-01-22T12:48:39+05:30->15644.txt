VADODARA: The impasse between school managements and parents on the fee hike issue turned ugly on Sunday when three parents were   for allegedly assaulting accountant of Shaishav School on Gotri-Sevasi Road. This is the first time since their protests that the parents have been booked.

 A group of parents had gone to school to make a representation on circulars demanding fees for third quarter.
 
 The complainant Rajesh Macwan told police in his complaint that he and another staff member of the school were instructed by the schoolâ€™s principal to go to Gotri police station and call the cops to control the crowd of parents outside the school gate on Saturday noon. When Macwan and his colleague Nirav reached outside school gate, the three persons Bhavik Dave,   Patel and Ankit Patel took away the key of his bike. Macwan then alleged that Dave then pulled him by his collars and Mukund then punched him. Mukund then threatened him that if he will call anyone from outside, they will ensure that the school will shut down. 
 
 Police said that when Macwan asked them not to use abusive words, the trio then did not allow him to pass from there. Frightened by threat, Nirav called for help hearing which school staff ran to their rescue.
 
 The group of parents had reached the school to submit a memorandum stating that since the school had already issued a circular in the past in which it had stated that it will abide by the order of the   High Court in connection to the Gujarat Self-Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017, the school should keep its promise. The parents were demanding that the school should refund the excess fees.
 
 But when the group reached the school premises, it was locked down and the parents were not allowed to enter or meet school representatives. According to the parents, even as police intervened and asked the school management to accept the memorandum from a couple of representatives, the school did not relent.
