NEW DELHI: Two CRPF personnel, on sentry duty at a camp near  , turned saviour for an 18-year-old girl who slipped and fell into the   canal in   on Saturday afternoon. 

 According to police, the girl had accidentally slipped through one of the broken parts of the embankment. Seeing the girl drown, the CRPF men immediately jumped into the canal and pulled her out in the nick of time. The girl was later admitted to a government hospital, where she is recuperating. 
 
 The incident took place on Saturday afternoon when the girl, Laxmi, a resident of a village near the Delhi-Haryana border, had gone to a temple on the edge of the canal. Locals said that a number of people visit the temple every Saturday. Eyewitnesses told cops that by afternoon, the crowd had swelled up. Anarrow embanked road, which leads to the temple, was queued up with devotees. 
 
 Laxmi, standing on the edge of the embankment, suddenly slipped and fell into the canal. Locals said that she initially called out for help, but no one tried to pull her out. By the time people raised an alarm, Laxmi had almost drowned. 
 
 Eyewitnesses told police that only Laxmi’s hand was visible when the CRPF men jumped into the canal. Hearing calls for help from one of the devotees, head constable KD Sharma and   let off their weapons and jumped into the canal. They swam up to the girl and pulled her out of the embankment. Laxmi had, by then, fallen unconscious due to asphyxiations and was rushed to the CRPF hospital inside the camp. She was later referred to a government hospital. 
 
 DCP (Rohini) Rajneesh Gupta said that the girl was stable and had given her statement to the police. Laxmi’s father,  , later reached the CRPF camp and thanked the security personnel for their bravery.
