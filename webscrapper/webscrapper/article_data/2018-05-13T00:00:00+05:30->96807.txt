Office presentation. Check. Tidy up the house. Check. Fix doc appointment. Check. Instruct the nanny. Check. Finally make time for self-care and exercise. Or try smaller, more effective workouts alongside your daily routine. ‘Working out with kids’ is a booming trend on social media, with pictures and videos of mothers playfully working out while their babies and toddlers hanging out in the background. Here are a few fun ‘plug n play’ workouts for all busy moms... 

 
  Nothing beats early morning yoga. Your kids are happily snoozing, just roll out your yoga mat and try 100 marches/50 jumping jacks as warmup followed by yoga poses like cobra, downward dog, cat and camel, plough pose, and supine bridges. Meanwhile, if the baby wakes up, get him/her to stretch out with you. Slightly older kids love the frog pose, ballerina pose and making partner boats.
 
 
 Many moms like to drop kids to the school bus stop. No matter how close the bus stand is you can always put on your sneakers and jog to the stop. You could make it into a light race if you like. While coming back, take a longer route. Walk / jog / run as per your fitness level and liking. 15-20 min of jogging is a great way to keep belly fat away, especially when you are touching your 40s. 
 
 Nothing works better for busy office people than a pre-lunch stair  . Take into account your fitness level and start walking 5-10 floors (up and down). Soon you will ditch the elevators. 
 
 
 Children instinctively love to move. Resistance bands are great for playing ‘hop over’ and Bosu balance trainers make fun mini trampolines. As your children grow older, workouts can be a great bonding time. Young moms could also indulge in hardcore stroller-based workouts to shed post-partum flab. Strollers can be used for great cardio, circuit training and body toning.
 
 
 Be a fitness ninja. Making the atmosphere conducive for a quick workout doesn’t always work, so the idea is to do one on the sly. Sneak in a 10-15 min high intensity interval training while your kids are eating or watching cartoons. Or invest in a stationary bike/treadmill and spend 20-30 mins daily.
