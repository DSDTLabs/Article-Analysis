AURANGABAD: Congress workers on Saturday staged a protest against BJP president   in front of the district collectorate here for allegedly making derogatory remarks about farmers when he addressed party workers in Jalna district recently.

 Amid the demonstrations, the Aurangabad police prevented Congress workers from trying to burn an   of Danve. Some women also used footwear to beat a picture of Danve. When some workers tried to burn Danve’s effigy, the police intervened and stopped them.
 
 Danve had criticised tur dal growers, saying, “So far, the state government has procured the highest amount of tur dal in history and it is going to purchase an additional 1 lakh tonne, still some farmers continue to complain.” 
 
 His remark evoked sharp reactions across the state with even  , the BJP ally in the state government protesting. The opposition parties Congress and NCP, as well as farmers groups took to the streets to register their protest. ‘Morchas’ were held at various places forcing   to express his regrets for his remarks.
 
 The farmers groups and opposition parties, however, have continued to seek an unconditional apology from Danve. District unit Congress president Namdeo Pawar, while addressing demonstrators in front of the collectorate here, demanded that Danve steps down as state BJP chief and tenders an unconditional apology to the farming community. He said similar agitations are being planned at the taluka level in the district and added, “Danve has made mockery of the problems being faced by farmers.”
 
 Pawar also said a team of about 40 to 50 Congress workers will visit   to extend their moral support to the activists staging a dharna in front of Danve’s residence there. Other Congress leaders who led the agitation included MLC  , former MLA Kalyan Kale, senior party workers Ibrahim Pathan, Subhash Dev, Bhausaheb Jagtap, Mateen Ahmed, Mohsin Pahelwar and Shaikh Salim.
