VIJAYAWADA: While the Union government continues to levy 12% GST on sanitary napkins, the   government on Thursday gave a women's day gift by providing sanitary napkins to schoolgirls, and women from self-help groups (SHGs) for free. Finance minister   announced an allocation of 127 crore under two separate heads for sanitary napkins. 

 Ramakrishnudu said female students tend to skip lectures during their menstrual cycle, leading to rising dropout rates. 
 
 The minister said the state would like to address the issue by supplying sanitary napkins to girls in government schools for free. He allocated another 100 crore for providing pads to women of self-help groups. About 80 lakh women from self-help groups would benefit.
