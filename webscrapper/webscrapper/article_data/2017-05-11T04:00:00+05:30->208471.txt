Chennai: Mumbai-based ION Energy on Wednesday said it has its angel round from a group of investors including Sushil Jiwarajka (Chairman of OMC Power and Founder of Nippo Batteries), Aakrit Vaish & Swapan Rajdev (Founders of Haptik) and other individual investors. 

 ION Energy, founded by Akhil Aryan, is building a layer of infrastructure to enable the adoption of electric vehicles in India. The company leverages proprietary enhancements to the Lithium-Ion technology to deliver high performance energy storage systems. The undisclosed amount of funds will be used towards product development and bringing the technology closer to mass manufacturing.
 
 ION Energy will join a committee being led by Professor Ashok Jhunjhunwala that is standardizing Lithium-Ion batteries for electric vehicles in India. 
 
 “We cannot share specifics till patents are filed. However, the product and distribution infrastructure will help make the choice between EVs and traditional gas guzzlers obvious. ION will deliver not only a more lucrative price per km, but also 5-6 times better acceleration, 10-12 times longer life, highest standards of safety and reliability with the fastest replenishment (aka charging time) compared to existing EVs,” said Aryan.
