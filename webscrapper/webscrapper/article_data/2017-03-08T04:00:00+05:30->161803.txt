Bharuch: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday suggested a feasibility study to start boat service in Narmada river from Bharuch to Sardar Sarovar Dam.

 “People, especially from Bharuch and Surat, will be able to enjoy with their families and friends and even celebrate birthdays and other occasions by travelling in boats from Bharuch to the dam site,” Modi said addressing a public rally at Bharuch’s Krushi University.
 
 “I know, if the boat project is successfully launched, Surtis will be the most happy,” he said to a cheering crowd.
 
 At present, there is no boat service from Bharuch to Kevadiya in Narmada river. If boats are started, tourism could get a big boost as there are number of holy spots located on the river banks. These include Neelkantheshwar, Shukaltirth, Kabirvad, Nareshwar, Poicha, Madhi, Chandod-Karnadi and Garudeshwar that located along the river bank.
 
 At present, the tourists have to travel by road from Zadeshwar towards Kevadiya. 
 
 Talking about the crucial Rs 4,000 crore Bhadbhut barrage project of Gujarat government, Modi said it would change the entire scenario of the downstream of Sardar Sarovar. “This will create huge sweet water reservoir and underwater tables will go up in 20 km area on each side of the river. State government has allocated Rs 1000 crore for the project and the work would begin soon,” he said.
 
 Modi also dedicates a modern bus terminal at Bharuch, which has been developed on the lines of those in Vadodra and Ahmedabad.
