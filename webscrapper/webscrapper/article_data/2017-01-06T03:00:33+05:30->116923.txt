MUMBAI:   suicides in India rose by a steep 42% between 2014 and 2015, according to newly-released data from the National Crime Records Bureau. The NCRB had recorded 5,650   by farmers and cultivators in 2014. The figure rose to 8,007 in the latest data. Several states battled severe drought in both 2014 and 2015. Some, including  , experienced two successive years of drought.

 Maharashtra recorded the highest number of farmer suicides, accounting for 37.8% of the share, with 3,030 cases. Telangana was second, with 1,358 cases, with Karnataka being third with 1,197 suicides, the data shows. 
 
 The six states of Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka accounted for 94.1% of the total farmer suicides in the country, the NCRB data shows.
 
 In fact, farmer suicides shot up even though as many as nine states and seven Union territories recorded no cases at all, as per NCRB figures. The states which reported nil farmer suicides in 2015 include Bihar, West Bengal, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Mizoram, Nagaland and Uttarakhand.
 
 “Highly erratic and inadequate monsoon in the last two-three years has aggravated problems for people engaged in farming. Manifestations of these in extreme situations can be seen in the form of farmers’ suicides,” the NCRB report said.
 
 While the data showed a sharp rise in suicides by farmers, it also recorded a steep 31.5% decline in suicides by agricultural labourers in the country during the same period. This category was introduced by the NCRB in 2014, a move which was criticized as an attempt to reduce the number recorded as “farmer suicides”. The suicides by agricultural labourers declined from 6,710 cases in 2014 to 4,595 in 2015, according to NCRB data.
 
 Maharashtra recorded the highest number of suicides in the category of agricultural labourers as well, accounting for 1,261 cases. Madhya Pradesh followed with 709 suicides and Tamil Nadu was behind MP with 604 cases.
 
 The overall number of suicides in the farming sector in the country recorded a marginal 2% increase, rising from 12,360 in 2014 to 12,602 in 2015. The figures have risen only marginally, given the major decline recorded in the number of suicides of agricultural labourers.
 
 The data found “bankruptcy and indebtedness” as the single largest underlying cause behind farmer suicides in 2015. As many as 38.7% of the 8,007 suicides were found to be linked to bankruptcy and indebtedness. Farming-related issues formed the second major cause behind suicides, accounting for 19.5% of the cases. As many as 72.6% of farmers who committed suicide in 2015 were small and marginal farmers who owned less than two hectares of land.
 
 “Farmer suicides tend to be higher in states like Maharashtra which cultivate cash crops. These require high investments and are also high risk,” said farm activist Vijay Jawandhia. States like Bihar where farmers migrate during the lean season are also better able to cope with farm distress, he said.
