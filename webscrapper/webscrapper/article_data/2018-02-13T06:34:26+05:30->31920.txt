AHMEDABAD: The   has refused to   and  , for going after the   hammer and tongs to give up a barbaric method of catching stray dogs.

 In June 2010, an FIR was lodged against Warden by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) Cattle Nuisance Control Department (CNCD), for allegedly taking away 20 iron tongs from an AMC office in Danilimda without the consent of officials. Justice B N Karia rejected Warden’s petition to quash charges of extortion and robbery on the grounds that the investigation is yet to take place in this case.
 
 Warden’s advocate argued that AMC had already prohibited catching of dogs with iron tongs. Under such circumstances, her campaign to persuade AMC officials to stop the barbaric method of catching street dogs cannot be said to be a criminal offence. It was also submitted a video recording of the incident reveals that Warden had not snatched the tongs, but the officials voluntarily handed over the instruments to her. This does not constitute an offence under sections 384 and 392 of the IPC, for extortion and robbery.
 
 After hearing the case, the HC said that the submissions about the petitioner working in animal welfare activities cannot be considered at this juncture. The evidence cited in support of the claims of innocence can be placed before the investigator, and the probe should take place in this case. Whether Warden and her associate were falsely implicated or a false complaint was filed cannot be considered by the HC.
