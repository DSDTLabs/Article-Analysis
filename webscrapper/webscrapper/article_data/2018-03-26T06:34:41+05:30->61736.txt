 The security issue arose when the Sultanganj police brought two road accident victims to the hospital in the wee hours on Sunday. “While one died within five minutes of being brought to the hospital, the other one passed away in an hour of arrival,” said JDA president Dr Vinay Kumar.
 
 After police contacted the kin of the victims, a large crowd assembled in the hospital and created ruckus outside emergency room number 102 from 5am to 10am.
 
 “The crowd did not hurt anyone, but the hospital guards ran away from the scene after they were unable to disperse it. The doctors on duty also left for fear of escalating violence and returned after 10am,” Dr Vinay told this reporter.
 
 The JDA has demanded the implementation of one patient-two attendant system effectively and increase in the number of guards.
