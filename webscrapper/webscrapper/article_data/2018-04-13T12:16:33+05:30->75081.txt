VADODARA: The Baroda Cricket Association’s (BCA) hopes of getting back crores of rupees that it had paid to an agent for a land deal in Sankarda have brightened. 

 The   has issued an order asking land agent Arvind Jani to deposit Rs 4.11 crore after dismissing his petition. Jani had approached the SC after   high court ordered him to deposit the amount in a local court.
 
 “The SC dismissed the special leave petition filed by Jani. He has been asked to deposit the amount in two instalments. Our hopes of getting the money back have gone up now. Also, we will make more efforts to recover the remaining Rs four crore towards interest,” said Amul Jikar, BCA treasurer. 
 
 Jani has been asked to deposit 50% amount by May 15, 2018 and the remaining by June 15. A local civil court had in November last year passed an interim order asking Jani to deposit the amount within four months following which he approached the high court to seek a stay order. 
 
 BCA had paid Jani Rs 4.11 crore to buy a piece of land in Sankarda in 2007 for constructing an international cricket stadium. The deal, however, failed to materialize and BCA has been trying to recover the money along with interest since then. 
 
 Jani had issued post-dated cheques of Rs 8.25 crore to BCA towards final settlement in 2013. But the cheques bounced following which BCA filed a separate case in the court. The association later bought a land in Kotambi on Halol Road for building a cricket stadium.
