Panaji: BJP’s Calangute MLA Michael Lobo was elected deputy speaker of the Goa legislative assembly, on Friday. Lobo, who polled 21 votes in the House of 39 members, defeated Congress’ Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes who polled 15 votes. Though the Congress has 16 MLAs, its St Andre MLA Francis Silveira did not vote as he reached late. NCP’s Churchill Alemao abstained from voting though he had voted in favour of the Parrikar-led coalition government in last week’s floor test. The BJP has 13 MLAs and is supported by Goa Forward Party (GFP) and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (GFP) with three MLAs each and backed by three independent MLAs.  Chief minister Manohar Parrikar congratulated Lobo on his win. Leader of opposition Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar and MGP minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar also congratulated Lobo. In his speech, Lobo called Parrikar a visionary leader who he had followed since his 2006 political debut, contesting panchayat polls.
