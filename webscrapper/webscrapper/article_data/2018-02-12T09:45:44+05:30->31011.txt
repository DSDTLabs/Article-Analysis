 On Sunday, the Indian meteorological department (IMD),  , recorded a minimum temperature of 20.3 degrees Celsius in normal range after it had risen to 22 degrees Celsius due to the formation of an area of low atmospheric pressure off the coast of Karnataka.
 
 A slight drizzle was also experienced last week. Currently, a cyclonic circulation persists over south   and the adjoining region and stretches up to 0.9 km above mean sea level.
 
 Formation of an area of low atmospheric pressure has also been reported in the southeast Arabian sea off the coast of Kerala, but both these phenomena are unlikely to affect Goa, IMD sources said.
 
 “The cloudiness is likely to decrease and there may be clearer skies on Monday,” said Rahul M, scientist, IMD, Panaji.
 
 The cloud formation 5 km above ground level may continue due to the confluence of winds. “But there will be no severe weather,” he said.
 
 While the minimum temperature, which had plunged to the lowest of the season to 17.6 degrees Celsius on February 2, had risen due to the trough off the Karnataka coast, the day temperature had been pleasant for most of the week due to cloudiness.
