NEW DELHI: Stepping up its attack against BJP in the upcoming civic polls, AAP has pitched a question to the public whether they want   or Vijender Gupta to “hold the reigns of the municipal corporations of Delhi”. Hoardings put up across the municipal areas by AAP carry photographs of CM Arvind Kejriwal and leader of opposition in Delhi assembly Vijender Gupta, and ask, “MCD ki bagdor kisko — Kejriwal or Vijender Gupta”.

 The decision to pit the CM against Gupta has surprised many. Sources in AAP said that Gupta was chosen as an opponent as he fought from New Delhi assembly seat in 2013 and he came third behind Arvind Kejriwal and Sheila Dikshit. “As he is the leader of opposition in Delhi assembly, the competition between Kejriwal and Gupta is not new,” said a source.
 
 AAP functionary Ashish Talwar said: “The voters of Delhi trust Kejriwal who kept his word on electricity and water, and will keep his word on abolishing house tax, making Delhi garbage-free and the civic bodies corruption-free.”
 
 Gupta said that his picture on the posters are “distorted”. “AAP is going to lose the municipal elections that is why it gets engaged in useless things. Civic polls are not a beauty contest,” he said.
 
 He dared Kejriwal to a debate with him rather than using posters. “AAP does not have the courage to use the photo of Narendra Modi. After the rout in Punjab and Goa polls, even Modi’s name scares them,” he said.
