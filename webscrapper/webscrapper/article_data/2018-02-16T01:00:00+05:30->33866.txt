We’ve seen   set temperatures soaring on screen with her oomph factor, but in her upcoming Telugu film ' ', she is touted to set the screen on fire with her daredevilry. The actress plays a warrior princess in the film, which requires her to perform some high-octane action sequences. Sunny recently visited Chennai, where she prepped for the part by undertaking lessons in horse riding. Says Sunny, “I’ve always loved taking up challenging projects and a fantasy action film was right up there on my to-do list. It also helps that my character is of a strong and independent woman. I have learnt the English way of riding a horse, which is relatively more poised, but for this film, I have to gallop the horse with 50 more behind me, which is challenging.”

 Meanwhile, it’s not just Sunny who is rocking it by learning something new.   is also busy striking a different note. The actress is learning to play the guitar for her next, ' ', in which she plays a rock star. And guess who got to sample her new talent first-hand? Her family. Prachi took her folks by surprise at a cousin’s wedding as she strummed the guitar and sang a few songs as well, including one from her upcoming film. She told us, “I have always wanted to learn the guitar. Fortunately, the film I am shooting for gave me that opportunity. It was fun breaking into an impromptu gig at my cousin’s wedding.”
