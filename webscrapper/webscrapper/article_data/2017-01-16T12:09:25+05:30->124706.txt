Popular television actress   says she was apprehensive about playing the role of a transgender in the show "Shakti- Astitva ke Ehsaas Ki".

 Rubina had earlier gained recognition by playing Radhika, the main character in TV soap "Choti Bahu" and was playing the same role in its sequel "  2".
 
 She says she did not anticipate this kind of positive response coming her way for the current show.
 
 "I knew that this was my last chance of proving my mettle as an actor and I gave it my all. I had no expectation.. so such a response boosts my confidence in my work and encourages me to do even more better," she says.
 
 The actress feels grateful to her fans for all the love.
 
 
 
 
 
 Rubina says when the role of a transgender was offered to her she was in two minds to take up the role or not.
 
 "I was apprehensive about taking up such a project. I was extremely nervous to rise against all the odds," she adds.
 
 To portray this character was a challenge in itself.
 
 "It's hard to relate to such unusual characters . Thus it becomes an everyday struggle to create something new to refine and maintain the charm of the performance."
 
 In the show "Shakti- Astitva ke Ehsaas Ki" she is paired opposite co-star Vivian D'Sena.
 
 "We both are professionals and we appreciate each other's work ethics."
 
 Recently, Rubina appeared on the show "Bigg Boss" and says if given a chance she would be open to be part of it.
 
 "I never followed ' '. It was this season that I not only spent time in the Bigg Boss house but also followed few episodes to know about the show. If Bigg Boss locks me inside the house, I would happily spend my days," she adds.
