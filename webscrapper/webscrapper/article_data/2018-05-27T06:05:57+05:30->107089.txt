NEW DELHI: The perfect score is now just one mark away. A Noida girl,  , has scored 499 out of 500 in CBSE’s Class XII board exams, and in the process become the all-India topper. She is ahumanities student. Last year’s topper   had scored 498. It is for the fourth consecutive year that a girl has topped the exam, and the sixth straight year when the all-India topper is from Delhi-NCR. Of the 13 students who got the top four positions, 11 are girls. 

 
 So intense is the race that 72,599 students scored 90% and above, 9,352 more than last year, and 12,737 have notched up 95% and more, up from 10,091. This will, of course, make admissions to   colleges tougher, with cutoffs likely to record a new high. Nine of the 12 students who got the top four ranks are from humanities. The other three are from science. 
 
 Meghna scored a perfect 100 in four subjects – history, geography, psychology and economics. She scored 99 in English core. The girl who got the all-India second rank —  , also from Delhi-NCR — scored just one mark less than Meghna in English core. She too got a perfect 100 in history, political science, economics and psychology. 
 
 
  
 
 “I took humanities because I am interested in it and enjoyed studying social science. And if you pursue the subject of your interest, you will do well. There is no secret mantra; it’s just hard work. It’s not about science or humanities, it’s all about one’s interest. However, I am happy that the stereotype of humanities students not scoring has been broken,” said Meghna. 
 
 The overall pass percentage has, meanwhile, increased by nearly 1 percentage point at 83.01 after a drop of 1.03 last year. Thiruvananthapuram continues to have the highest pass percentage (97.32), while Kendriya Vidyalayas (97.78) are the best among institutions. Girls (88.31) maintained a lead over boys (78.99) in pass percentage and also bagged the top positions. Even among the top three performers in the differently-abled categories, two are girls.
