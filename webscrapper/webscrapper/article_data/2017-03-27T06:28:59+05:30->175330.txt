THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: When transport minister   was announcing his resignation,   interim chief MM Hassan was educating a group of journalism students on the unethical practice of the new media in sensationalising news without checking facts that could cause irreparable damage to individuals.

 Hassan, when confronted with the news, said Saseendran was liable to put in his papers for the alleged ‘obscene phone conversation’. Later, reacting to the reporters, he termed it a ‘shameful act’. Hassan ended abruptly his bitter remarks on media for ‘jumping the gun and flouting ethics to lose its credibility’. But,  , saw a flood of comments against this kind of ‘Peeping Tom’ journalism. Several visual media journalists expressed their disgust on Facebook.
 
 This is not journalism but filthy work, said senior visual media journalist Pramod Raman. “Action should be initiated against the news channel. This is not news presentation but a criminal activity with an obscene gesture. It’s not the ex-minister who has insulted people of Kerala, but this channel and its anchors,” said Manila C Mohan, another TV journalist.Visual media journalist Saneesh Elayadath questioned the way the news was presented. “When a minister is engaged in such conversation, he is just an ordinary person. If the ex-minister had asked for sexual favours misusing his powers, the news should have been presented in another way,” he said.
 
 Director Aashiq Abu added that audio or visual clips could be created from anyone’s bedroom. Social activist Parvathy T, termed it a trap. “If it was not with the woman’s consent, let her make a complaint. You should not resign as we have to end this trend of media resorting to this type journalism, which is an intrusion of privacy,” she said. Lawyer Harish Vasudevan sought the help of judiciary to ‘rein in activities carried out by some in the name of journalism’.
