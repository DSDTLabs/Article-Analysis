AHMEDABAD: The legal battle between Prakash Makwana and his wife, Manjula, for the   of their   ended in a   between the   who walked out of the   together and happy with their son. Had it not been for an initiative by the lawyers and intervention by the high court, the couple’s reunion would not have been possible.

 In the first week of March, Manjula filed a habeas corpus petition in the high court seeking custody of her 1.5-year-old son Vansh. She claimed that in November last year, her husband had snatched away the child when she had gone to her parents’ home in Chandkheda area. She had earlier left her husband’s house following a domestic dispute. When the father did not return the child for four months, the mother approached the high court.
 
 The high court summoned Makwana, asking him to bring the child to court. During the pendency of the litigation, the lawyers involved came to know that the woman had left her husband’s home over a minor dispute and the husband and wife did not have any real complaint against each other. 
 
 The lawyers informed the high court about this and the judges discussed the matter. The woman told the court that she did not have any problem with her husband and that they can live together. Makwana too promised the court to take good care of his wife and son. The high court advised them to give up the quarrel for the child’s custody and start their life afresh.
 
 “Both husband and wife are living together and we have not heard any complaint from them,” said advocate Mahesh Baria, who had represented the woman.
