BHUBANESWAR: The CBI on Monday issued fresh summons to the BJD's Balasore MP,  , over his alleged links with the  , a chit fund company. The parliamentarian has been asked to appear before it on January 12 for interrogation. 

 "We have sought some explanations from him about the financial transactions between him and Seashore Group," said a CBI officer. 
 
 Twice Jena has been quizzed by the CBI, once on January 12, 2015 and then again on December 10, 2016.
 
  While repeated summons to the BJD leader fuelled speculation about his suspected complicity in the scam, he kept on denying his involvement. 
 
 "Seashore Group had taken loan of around Rs 18 crore from me in 2011-12. The firm had paid back the bulk of the loan but it still owes me Rs 1.86 crore," Jena was quoted as saying last December. 
 
 The fresh summons to Jena has come as a boost to the opposition Congress to target the ruling BJD ahead of the panchayat elections, scheduled next month. 
 
 Ever since two top Trinamool Congress leaders - Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Tapas Pal - were arrested by the CBI for their alleged role in the Rose Valley chit fund scam, the state Congress has been demanding that the agency expedite its investigations into the alleged links between some BJD leaders and several chit fund firms
 
 The alleged involvement of some BJD leaders in chit fund scams came to the fore after the CBI took over the probe following the   directive on May 9, 2014. 
 
 The BJD's Banki MLA Pravat Tripathy and Mayurbhanj MP   were arrested in two separate cases in 2014. Subsequently, the ruling party's Dharmasala MLA Pranab Balabantray, Choudwar-Cuttack legislator Pravat Biswal and Balasore MP Jena were quizzed in the scam. 
 
 Then in pril last year food supplies minister   was also summoned by the CBI in connection with the AT Group scam.
