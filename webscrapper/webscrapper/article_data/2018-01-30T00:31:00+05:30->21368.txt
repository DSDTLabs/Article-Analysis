Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday expressed serious concern over the action by district administrations permitting stone quarries on mountains in the state and directed the director of geology and mining to appear before it with details as to licences issued for carrying out quarry operations in hillocks. One M Shanmugam alias Shanmugavel from Rajakallupatti municipality in Madurai filed a public interest litigation (PIL) against the permission given for quarrying an area in his locality in which the Perumalmalai (hill) is situated. It came up for admission before the division bench of justices N Kirubakaran and R Tharani. The petitioner’s counsel told the court that Perumalmalai is surrounded by a dense forest with wild boars, foxes, gaurs, rabbits, peacocks and other migratory birds. Besides, there are several check dams in it. The water that comes from those dams helps irrigate nearly 250 acres in many villages. While being so, the authorities gave permission to one Aathimuthan to run a stone quarry in Mettupatti village in survey number 418 to an extent of two hectare, in which survey number the Perumalmalai comes. Now, the licencee has taken steps to lay pathway over the hill to carry out quarry operations there.  Already, locals have strongly objected to the proposed quarry. Despite it, officials have helped the contractor, he said. Besides, on behalf of the said contractor one R S Ramkumar had already filed a case in the name of a PIL and obtained a direction for removal of encroachments on the cart track in Rajakallupatti.  The court also came to know that the authorities gave licence to quarry Perumalmalai by naming it as unassessed waste land. Following it, the court said, “Officials are restrained from making any preparatory works for quarrying in Perumalmalai. Besides, the director of geology and mining should appear before the court on Tuesday with details as to licences given to carryout quarry operations in hillocks.”
