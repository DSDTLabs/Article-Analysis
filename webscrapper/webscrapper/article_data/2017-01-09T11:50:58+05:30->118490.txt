RAJKOT: Gujarat Information Commission (GIC) has imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on   (JMC) executive engineer and public information officer (PIO) L K Vadher for not providing information in the stipulated timeframe under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. 

 In a recent order, GIC also asked Vadher to deposit the fine in the government treasury and if he failed to do so, JMC has been directed to deduct the amount from his salary. JMC commissioner has been asked to file action taken report by March 3.
 
 The order was issued on an application filed by Junagadh-based RTI activist Atul Shekdha.
 
 He had sought details about the government-funded housing schemes in   and its details like maps, permission acquired from concerned authorities regarding the housing plan, among other details. “I filed my RTI application in August 2015. However, JMC officials were not providing exact details that I had sought. 
 
 So, I filed an appeal with the GIC in  ,” Shekhda told TOI.
 
 GIC observed that Vadher, who is also a PIO, did not provide information within 30 days to the application mandated under RTI Act.
 
 “GIC is concerned about negligence by the PIO as he did not provide information to the applicant even after GIC issued a show-cause notice to Vadher on December 1,” R R Varsani, information commissioner, said in his order.
 
 GIC asked the PIO to provide all information to the applicant free of cost within 20 days.
 
 “I suspected some irregularities were done under the housing scheme for poor. Therefore, I had sought details under RTI. 
 
 However, JMC officials were reluctant to provide it and were using delaying tactics,” claimed Shekhda.
