DEHRADUN: On Wednesday, when PM   arrived at Kedarnath for the opening of the shrine for this year’s  , a huge crowd including locals and the shrine town’s priests gathered to welcome him. Although only a few select priests got the opportunity to accompany the PM inside the shrine, the excitement among the purohits was palpable. “It is for the first time that a Prime Minister was present at the opening of the temple and this gives a very important message to everyone. I am sure the number of visitors would be higher this time,” said Bhagwat Shukla, a priest.
 
  Praveer Tiwari, one of the priests who accompanied Modi inside the shrine and helped him conduct the ‘rudrabhishek’ (special pooja) of the deity, told TOI over phone that he felt privileged that the PM had come for the opening of the shrine. He claimed that Modi’s family had been regular visitors to the shrine for the past 30 years. “Modi jee’s brothers Pankaj Bhai and Prahlad Bhai and other family members used to come to Kedarnath for darshan regularly. I also used to travel to Gujarat to visit them and give prasad from the temple to his mother. It was a privilege for me to welcome him to the temple again and conduct the pooja for him for the first time since he became the PM.”
  
  Tiwari claimed that Modi recognised him even though he was meeting after a long time. “I had last met him when he was CM of Gujarat but did not get a chance to meet him after that. I am surprised that he recognised me and enquired about my well-being. The temple committee and priests gifted the PM a miniature of the  . He said that he was overwhelmed at having the darshan of Baba Kedar,” said Tiwari.
  
  The priests said that they had also conveyed to the Prime Minister about the need to have a motorable road connecting Gaurikund to Kedarnath which they said would help more pilgrims visit the remote Himalayan shrine.
