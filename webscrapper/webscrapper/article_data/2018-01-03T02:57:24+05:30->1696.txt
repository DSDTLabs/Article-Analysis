NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality turned “severe” on Tuesday as   continued to prevail in the capital for the third straight morning. The maximum   also fell to 17.7 degrees Celsius — the lowest this season as visibility fell below 200 metres in the morning.

 The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 408 — a slight rise from the reading of 400 on Monday with both PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels hovering close to “emergency” levels. Experts, however, say there will soon be an improvement in terms of air quality as the fog intensity is likely to reduce from Wednesday onwards.
 
 “There will be moderate to dense fog on Wednesday morning and the intensity will start reducing after that. Delhi will then see shallow to moderate fog from Thursday morning,” said a scientist at the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre in Delhi.
 
 The Safdarjung observatory, which is taken as the base for Delhi’s weather, recorded a   of 17.7 degrees Celsius on Tuesday — two degrees below normal for the season. The minimum was recorded at 8.4 degrees Celsius — one notch above normal. Forecasts for Wednesday show a maximum and minimum of 19 and six degrees Celsius, respectively.
 
 Delhi’s average PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels according to CPCB’s central control room were over four times the safe standard and remained close to the “severe plus” or “emergency” levels under the Graded Response Action Plan.
 
 Air quality is at “severe plus” if PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels are over 300 and 500 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively for a period of 48 hours or more. Delhi’s average PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels on Tuesday were 273 and 448 micrograms per cubic metre respectively.
 
 The Supreme Court appointed EPCA said that while it was initially supposed to issue instructions on Tuesday, it put it off for the time being as pollution levels continued to deteriorate. “We are observing the condition and action will be taken accordingly,” said an EPCA official.
