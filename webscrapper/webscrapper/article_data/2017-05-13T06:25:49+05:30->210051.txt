PATIALA: Wife of a   (SP) posted in Punjab on Friday accused her husband and his   of raping her at a relative’s house after she confronted the officer on infidelity. 

 The survivor’s brother, who is a school teacher, said the couple had been married for 16 years and had two children. He said they had been staying separately for quite some time as his brother-in-law was in illicit relationship with many women. However, he added, the SP was staying with one particular woman in his official house. 
 
 “When my sister got to know about his new relationship, she went to confront him at a relative’s house, where the cop asked his maternal uncle to   her to teach her a lesson,” he alleged.
 
 The accused SP has refuted all the charges, saying the two families had called a meeting to help the couple reconcile when the woman came there with her father and there were other women present too. “How can such a thing happen in the presence of women?” he asked.
 
 The officer’s brother-in-law alleged his sister was bleeding profusely and had even sustained injuries on various parts of her body after she was assaulted by the two. Appealing the authorities to help them, he said he feared that the SP may use his influence to get false cases registered against him and his family. 
 
 Patiala MP Dr  , who visited the woman in the hospital where she is undergoing treatment, demanded immediate action against the accused cop and his relative. He said it was not just a crime against a woman, but a crime committed in uniform and action should be taken against the accused. He said he would be writing to the chief minister for action in this case.
 
 Meanwhile, Patiala senior superintendent of police (SSP)   said a police team had been sent to record the complainant woman’s statement, after which further action would be taken as per law.
