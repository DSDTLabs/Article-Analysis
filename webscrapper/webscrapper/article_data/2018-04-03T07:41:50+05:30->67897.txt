LUCKNOW: The switch over to e-lottery for liquor shop licences has left tipplers in the lurch in   for the last one week.. Dry day like situation has been prevailing in the state every day since then, with more than 25,000 liquor shops facing supply crunch.

 Even starred properties, pubs and bars have been forced to shut shop as their demand to replenish stock are delayed due to the teething troubles excise department is facing. The situation is likely to turn normal by this weekend.
 
 According to market players, the crisis has evolved since all stakeholders, including excise department, liquor companies, distilleries, breweries, bonded warehouses, wholesalers and retailers are grappling with new rules and procedures as per the revised policy. In UP, six types of licences are issued for wholesale trade of foreign liquor, beer and wine. 
 
 As brands registered with the department have to switch over to new guidelines, which include secured bar coding to enable tracking of inventory, bottles that would hit the shelf now would have newly-added features.
 
 A general manager of a starred property in Gomtinagar said that though they have permanent liquor licence they are unable to serve booze since liquor companies were yet to distribute required brands.
 
 Business has been hit. "Last weekend seemed like a series of dry days since excise department was not issuing temporary licence," said  , director of a restrobar in Vibhutikhand.
 
 District excise officer   said that liquor companies have started distributing stock to retailers. 
 
 "It will take two to three days for things to get in order," he said.
 
 Sardar SP Singh, owner of a model shop at  , said, "Tipplers will have to wait till next week to get all brands. Some companies are ready with 750-ml bottle but are unable to supply 180-ml quarter. They have asked for more time."
