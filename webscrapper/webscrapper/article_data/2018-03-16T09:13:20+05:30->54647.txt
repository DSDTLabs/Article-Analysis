CHANDIGARH: In order to reduce the rush to PGIMER from neighbouring states, PGIMER authorities said they have asked Punjab, Haryana and   to strengthen their medical services and have also offered to help them by training their doctors in handling less critical patients. However, no response has been received from the three states as a result of which the rush in PGI continues to shoot up

 “The flow of the patient rush will be reduced in PGI only if the peripheral services of neighbouring states will be strengthened,” said   of PGI Prof   during a meeting organised by him with the media on competition of one year as a director of PGIMER. “The health officials of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh have been given a proposal that the PGI is ready to provide training to the medical personnel, including doctors, technicians or other, so that they can strengthen their medical facilities. All we can do is request them to come and get trained at PGI,” said Prof Jagat Ram. Presently the number of patients visiting PGI is more than 11,000, which was 8,000 till last year.
 
 “We have further asked our doctors to reach OPD’s on time to clear the OPD rush efficiently and quickly,” he said.
 
 “Efforts have been made to contact and hold meetings with the neighbouring states and have requested their appropriate authorities to strengthen their internal system, so that overburdening of referrals which otherwise can be avoidable medically should not come on to PGI,” deputy director administration (DDA) at   said.
 
 Delay in the tests in PGI
 
 Agreeing to the fact that the patients have to wait for long for getting the tests done, Prof Jagat ram said that they have already directed the concerned departments that if the patients are from economically weaker background and suffer from the life-threatening disease the test should be done timely.
