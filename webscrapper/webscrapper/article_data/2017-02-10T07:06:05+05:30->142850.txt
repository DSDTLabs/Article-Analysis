PUNE: As soon as a bus stopped at the traffic signal at Ramtekdi junction on   around 7.30pm on Wednesday, a man snatched the cellphone of a passenger from the window. Little did he know a police officer would immediately chase him. 

 The snatcher tried his best to flee. But the cop nabbed him after a 10-minute chase. Sub-inspector   recovered the cellphone from the suspect,   (25), and handed him over to the Wanowrie police. Shinde has been arrested and booked under Section 392 (robbery) of IPC.
 
 Sub-inspector Jadhav, attached to the Samarth police station, was on his way home in Hadapsar around 7pm on Wednesday to resume the night duty. "I had stopped at the signal at Ramtekdi junction a few metres behind a   bus," he said.
 
 He saw a man standing on the footpath and looking at the bus. All of a sudden, the man went near the vehicle, put his hand inside through a window and snatched something. "The passenger in the bus immediately raised an alarm," Jadhav said.
 
 Jadhav left his motorcycle on the road and started running towards the man. "Seeing a cop approaching him, the accused ran," he said.
 
 He said the suspect jumped onto the BRTS route and ran on the opposite direction of the road. "Despite vehicles on the road, I also crossed the BRTS corridor," Jadhav said.
 
 The man was running zigzag to dodge Jadhav. "He again crossed the road. But, I followed him. I was alerting people on the road. But, no one dared to stop him," he said. Jadhav nabbed the suspect near Kalubai temple in Hadapsar. The bus passenger, Ram Chandak of Satara, reached the spot in the meantime and said the suspect had snatched his phone.
