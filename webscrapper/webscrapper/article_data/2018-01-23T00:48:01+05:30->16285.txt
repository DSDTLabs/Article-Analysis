GREATER NOIDA: Residents of   on Monday complained to the GNIDA about open drains and alleged negligence towards them.

 The residents, who had raised the issue last year too, said the open drains posed a threat to lives and could cause accidents.
 
 “Open drains and unattended sewer lines are spread across Sector Beta 1. Some of them have indented at some places and are not clearly visible to the naked eye from even a short distance. Such sites can lead to major accidents,” said Harinder Bhati, the general secretary of Sector Beta 1  .
 
 Bhati said they had earlier complained to the senior manager of GNIDA, Subhash Chandra, but to no avail. 
 
 “No one from the GNIDA paid attention to the matter. Therefore, we have requested CEO Debashish Panda, and DGMs PK Kaushik and Ashok Arora to take action against such carelessness,” said Bhati.
 
 He claimed that Sector Beta 1 faced several other civic problems but neither the senior officials nor the contractors paid attention to their grievances. “Despite tenders awarded for the Sector recently, no contractor is ready to address these issues.” 
 
 In October 2017, the residents had made a similar complaint against open drains in their sector as well as in other areas such as Alpha, Gamma, Omicron and so on. 
 
 “Children are at grave risk of meeting with accidents, especially during the evening when they return home from parks and playgrounds. These open sewers are not visible,” said Snehlata Singh, a resident of Alpha 1.
 
 Officials from the GNIDA declined comment on the complaints.
