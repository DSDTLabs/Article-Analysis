Actress   said she is not proud of her   and regrets going under the knife. In the latest issue, the 59-year-old opens up about the regrets as well as the reason for her divorce from Antonia Banderas and battling addiction. 

  
  
 Griffith admits she was unaware of how drastically her cosmetic surgeries "she had over 20 years ago" had changed her face. "No, I didn't (realize) until people started saying, 'Oh my god, what has she done?!' I was so hurt. I went to a different doctor, and he started dissolving all of this that this other woman doctor had put in. Hopefully, I look more normal now," she said. 
 
 Though she feels confident that she raised her three children  , 31, Dakota Johnson, 27, and  , 20 to the best of her abilities, she also says there are some things she would have gone back and done differently. 
 
 "I was a totally functioning mom. I wasn't like a drunk-on-the-floor, out-of-it person. I didn't do some things I probably should have done, but, mostly, I was there for my kids. They had a sort of privileged gypsy life." 
 
 The actress married Banderas in 1996 and they were together for 18 years before divorcing in 2015. "I think part of the reason my marriage to Antonio fell apart was because I was stuck; nobody else is to blame. It's just that I personally got stuck and I won't let that happen again, I want to enjoy life, I want to do whatever I want to do," she said.
