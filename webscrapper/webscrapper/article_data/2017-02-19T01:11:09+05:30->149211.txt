GURUGRAM: Five people were   for a   in October 2013 during a brawl that started with a   asking his team leader for leave as his wife had given birth to a boy.

 Additional district and sessions judge Sudesh Kumar Sharma held the team leader, Mukesh Bisht, Ram Kishan, Pawan Banjara, Isram Dutt and Harikrishan guilty after a four-year trial.
 
 Public prosecutor Vikas Sharma said the brawl had started on October 5, 2013 after Sunil Kumar, then 25 years old, had asked his Bisht (30), his supervisor at Serco Pvt Ltd in Udyog Vihar Phase 4, for a day off. Bisht refused and the two started arguing.
 
 As tempers flared, the duo came out of the office building. Soon, they came to blows. They called other for help. Kumar was joined by his cousin Devender, Ram Avtar, Braham and Sanjay while Bisht called Ram Kishan, Isram Dutt, Pawan Banjara, and some others.
 
 Investigations showed Bisht and the others attacked Kumar with a dagger. Devendra and Avtar, his friend who was a medical representative, stepped in and tried to calm things down but got severely injured by sharp weapons in the process. They later succumbed to injuries. Kumar and Sanjay also sustained injuries. By the time police arrived, Bisht and the others had fled. The cops took the victims to hospital. 
 
 During the investigation, the first to be arrested was Banjara. Bisht, originally from Almora in Uttarakhand, surrendered in court later. Police subsequently nabbed the three other accused as well. “I am happy justice was done, but I feel sad for that unfortunate incident. A little argument turned violent and two people lost their lives for no reason,” said Kumar, who has fully recovered from his injuries and is currently working a private firm.
 
 Prosecutor Sharma said CCTV footage of The Udyog Vihar area proved crucial in nailing the culprits.
