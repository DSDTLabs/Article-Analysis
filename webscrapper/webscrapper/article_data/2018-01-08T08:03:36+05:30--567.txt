BENGALURU: Women in Bengaluru will soon get a wrist band that will be the key to their security, if a BBMP proposal becomes a reality. 

 The wearable technology module, to help women in distress alert their near and dear ones and a central monitoring agency as well by merely moving their arms in a particular way, has been aptly named Raksha Band. It’s a spin on Raksha Bandhan, where women tie rakhis on their brothers’ wrists. 
 
 The 100-crore proposal for Raksha Bands has been sent to the Centre under the safe-city scheme, with the money coming from the Nirbhaya fund, commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad said.
 
 “While wearing the band, if a woman moves her hand in a particular way, then her location details will be sent to family members and friends. The band costs Rs 700-800, but it will be available for Rs 300,” he said.
 
 The band will be integrated with a mobile application, which will come pre-programmed with the numbers of police and emergency services. The wearer can enter contact details of up to five guardians who will be alerted whenever she is in distress. To provide more insight into the emergency the user is in, audio clips and pictures will be automatically captured and shared with the central server for aiding security agencies.
 
 Through the app, users can crowdsource information such as availability of CCTVs, lighting in the area and proximity of security agencies. This will allow the central monitoring agency to arrive at a safety score for the area, which can then be viewed by fellow users. BBMP is targeting use of 10,00,000 bands in three years.
