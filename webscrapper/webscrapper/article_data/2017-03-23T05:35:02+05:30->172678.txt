MANALI:   which is covered in 20 to 30ft of snow and is under attack of blizzards, avalanches and chilling winds has been opened for pedestrians from Kullu and snow-bound   but the pedestrians will have to cross it at their own risk.

 Pedestrians will be at the mercy of weather. Sudden change in weather conditions will prove fatal for them. Many have lost their lives while attempting to cross the 13,051ft high Rohtang pass. Be it inclement weather or sunny day, both conditions are dangerous. It will take at least two more months to restore road connectivity with Lahaul and Ladakh and emergency helicopter service is not sufficient to provide relief to all the people in need, people will now start crossing Rohtang on foot to reach their destination.
 
 An official said that two rescue posts have been established on either side of Rohtang pass to monitor the movement of pedestrians. Each rescue team comprises of nine persons including trained mountaineers, police, medical team, radio operator, cook and helper. Both the rescue teams will stay in snow-bound regions away from civilization until road across Rohtang is opened for traffic after removing the snow.
 
 Officials have warned people that cross Rohtang pass only after ensuring that weather is favourable and safe. The administration of Lahaul-Spiti has requested people to register them in both the rescue posts before and after crossing Rohtang to ensure that they have crossed the pass safely. Rescue posts will not allow people to go towards Rohtang it the experts feel that conditions are inclement and dangerous.
 
 Meanwhile,   (BRO) will officially start snow clearance operation on   highway from Thursday after organizing a puja for the safety of men engaged in operation.
