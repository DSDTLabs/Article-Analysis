LUCKNOW: A lawyer from UP's Pratapgarh district has filed a petition against former   chief minister BS   and protem Speaker   for disrespecting the national flag and national anthem on May 19. 

 The petitioner said that Yeddyurappa and Bopaiah, both from  , walked out of the Karnataka assembly even as the national anthem was being played. 
 
 The two leaders had left the assembly after Yeddyurappa announced his resignation. Petitioner Gyan Prakash said that besides flouting legal norms, the two leaders are liable for punishment for hurting the sentiments of Indians. 
 
 District court Kunda has accepted the plea and fixed May 29 for next hearing. The petition was filed on May 21. "What former Karnataka CM and protem speaker did was seen by everyone on national television. Their act was condemned on social media and by people in general but the criticism failed to evoke apology from the two BJP leaders. Thus, I decided to move to the court," Gyan told TOI. 
 
 Speaking to reporters on May 19, Congress president   had also pointed to Yeddyurappa's act of leaving the assembly while the national anthem was being played. Videos showing Yeddyurappa leaving the assembly during the national anthem were widely shared on social media. 
 
 Gyan said Yeddyurappa and   had violated Section 3 of the the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act 1971, which deals with disrespect shown to the national anthem and is a punishable offence under the Act. 
 
 Gyan claimed that what he felt was a common sentiment shared by his fellows in the  , a body of around 10,000 lawyers across India. "We felt that as a citizen of India, it is everyone's duty to follow the code of conduct. The general sense of responsibility gets diluted when our public representatives disregard the rules," he said.
