ARARIA/PATNA: Two youths were arrested on Friday for allegedly raising anti-national slogans during the victory procession of newly elected RJD MP from Araria,   Alam, on Wednesday. In a video that went viral on the social media, three youths are seen shouting slogans such as 'Pakistan zindabad' and 'Bharat tere tukde honge'. 

 The duo arrested has been identified as Sultan Aazmi and Shehzad, while police are conducting raids to nab the third accused.
 
 However, a news website said that it found after doing an audio analysis that there were "serious issues with lip sync in the video". It added that at two spots in the three videos that it analysed, the audio level was zero.
 
 The RJD MP initially said the video was fake. On Friday, he told newspersons that police should take stern action against the accused if the video was authentic.
 
  Araria is a Muslim-dominated constituency bordering Nepal. Reacting to BJP's defeat, Union minister   had said on Thursday: "Araria is not just a bordering area, connected to Nepal and Bengal... (It is moving) to a hardline ideology, which is not just dangerous for Bihar, but for the whole country. It will become a hub of terrorism." 
 
 RJD leader   said on Friday that nothing could be said about the video until its authenticity was verified. "And why hasn't a case been registered against Union minister Giriraj Singh for giving such a provocative statement?" he said, referring to his statement on Thursday. Tejashwi's mother Rabri Devi alleged that the "slogan show was engineered by BJP as part of a conspiracy against RJD".
 
  The two arrests were made following an FIR which was lodged by Araria town police station SHO Deepankar Srigyan on Thursday evening on the basis of a self-complaint after he received the video on his cellphone. "The video seems to have been shot in the   locality where MP Sarfaraz has his house," the SHO said.
