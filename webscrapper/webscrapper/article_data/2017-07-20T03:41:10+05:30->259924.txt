MUMBAI: A preliminary probe by   and   has established that   procured tur dal in the open market and illegally sold stocks at higher rates in the name of farmers to state-run procurement centres in May 2017. As per rules, only farmers can sell tur to the   (Nafed), the government's main agency for procurement of pulses. 

 A senior bureaucrat told TOI the probe has found that in 50 cases, traders indulged in illegal arbitrage to sell tur worth Rs 1 crore to Nafed in violation of state and central government guidelines. “We probed all such cases where 30 quintals or more of tur was sold to Nafed. There was no verification if tur has been brought by farmers or otherwise,” he said.
 
 It was after many complaints alleging irregularities that Jalna guardian minister Babanrao Lonikar asked collector Shivajirao Jondhale to conduct a probe into tur procurement by Nafed. “We submitted a list of 800 farmers to the superintendent of police for investigation. While the market price of tur is Rs 4,000 per quintal, Nafed procurement price is Rs 5,050. So far, probe has been completed in 50 cases,’’ he said.
 
 Jalna’s Nafed procurement centre was in news even earlier after 377 lakh quintals of tur was sold by the family of Shiv Sena leader and minister of state for textiles Arjun Khotkar in a single day. When eyebrows were raised over the sale, Khotkar sought to defend himself saying there was nothing illegal in the sale. “I am a farmer. My family owns huge tracts of land in Latur and nearby areas,’’ Khotkar said.
 
 Meanwhile, the bureaucrat said Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has directed the department of agriculture and marketing to procure an additional 23 lakh quintals of tur. “The CM’s decision will be a huge relief to farmers,’’ he said.
