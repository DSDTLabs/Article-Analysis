Besides being drop dead gorgeous, a yoga and   and a self-appointed “spokespersons for stray dogs”,   just showed us that she has a bit of a musician in her too. In a video she posted on her social media accounts recently, she is seen playing a piano in the lobby of a hotel she is staying at. Sharing that the tune she played has a special childhood memory associated with it, Adah posted: “This was the first piece I learned to play when I was 6. Now everytime I play the piano I have to first start with this before I play anything else (sic).”
Oh, do we need to add that she looked gorgeous in a black ensemble and those really cool John Lennon-inspired sunglasses? Adah be so cool, we can’t help but envy her swagger in everything she does.
