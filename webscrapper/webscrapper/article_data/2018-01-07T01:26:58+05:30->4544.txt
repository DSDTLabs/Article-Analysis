GURUGRAM: Over 150 residents of Sushant Lok 2 and 3 took out a protest march on Saturday morning to demonstrate against the recent hike in   and water charges by the developers, Rigoss Estate Network Pvt Ltd - a subsidiary of Ansals.

 The   were held outside Ansals’ maintenance office in Sector 57. 
 
 The residents told TOI that the builder had hiked the fees multiple times before the hike last month. 
 
 “Previously, the maintenance charge was Rs 2.5 per square yard of area. Now, it has been increased to Rs 3.5,” said M S Yadav, member of RWA of Sushant Lok 2 and 3.
 
 “Similarly water charges - along with all the taxes - was Rs 3.5 per square yard of area. Now, they have increased it to Rs 6.5,” he said. 
 
 The protesters told TOI that the hike was enforced last month. “We had sent a letter to Rigoss on December 28. We had asked them to revoke the hike,” said Gaurav, a protester. “However, they never gave us a reply. So finally on Saturday, we were forced to take out a protest march.”
 
 Protesters said that they also submitted a memorandum to the representatives of Rigoss at their office. 
 
 When TOI contacted Rigoss officials, they said that the hike was justified. “This is the first hike we have made in a span of eight years. It is a legitimate hike. We had been facing problems on account of the maintenance costs,” an official said.
 
 Sushant Lok 2 and 3 is a 550-acre township that has nearly 3,500 plots and houses over 50, 000 residents.
