CHENNAI: It was a Deja vu moment at the Grenke Classic chess tournament in Germany on Sunday evening. Much like the fifth round where all the five matches ended in stalemates, the eighth round too followed the same route.

 
 Fabiano Caruana, who recently won the Candidates tournament to book a place against   in the World championship final to be held in London later this year, drew his 8th round against Levon Aronian. Caruana, who was playing with the white pieces, shared the points with his opponent after 32 moves. The draw means   continues to lead the points tally with 5.3 points from 8 outings. Close on Caruana's heels is current World champion   who shared the spoils with   Nikita Vitiugov. The clash --- which saw Carlsen play with white --- went on for 65 moves. It was a keenly-fought affair with both players not ready to offer an inch. Nikita and Carlsen share the second spot with 5 points apiece.
 
 Two players --- Aronian and Maxime Vachier Lagrave --- are on 4 points each sharing the third position in the table. Maxime drew with Matthais Bluebaum.
 
 Multiple time World champion   drew his eighth round clash against Arkadij Naiditsch. Meanwhile, Yifan Hou played out a draw against her opponent  .
 
 In the final round on Monday, Anand will be locking horns with Carlsen, a clash that is bound to generate a lot of spectator interest from across the globe. Caruana faces Nikita in his final round clash while Maxime will be up against Meier.
