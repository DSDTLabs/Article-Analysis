LUCKNOW: There is a rise in number of cases of failed surgery received by   at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences for corrective operation. About 30% of the surgeries in the department are now in the re-operative category, tripling the number two decades ago.

 The institute will hold a continuing medical education programme during the surgical   (March 31-April 5) on re-operative GI surgeries. Head of surgical gastroenterology, Prof Rajan Saxena said, “Re-operative surgeries comprise one-third of our total work burden of 150 surgeries per year.”
 
 He added, “Incomplete or technically incorrect surgeries, operative accidents at the time of first surgery leading to complication, recurrence of disease and second complications emerging out of emergency procedures cause failure of an operation.” 
 
 Faculty member Prof Anu Behari said the proportion of failed surgery change depending on the organ involved. “Gall bladder removal is the commonest procedure done, especially in the private sector and thus more cases of failure from this category are seen. Being less common, pancreas and intestines appear less,” she explained. 
 
 The issue assumes importance considering that 40% of all surgeries taking place in the world relate to the gastroenterological tract (from food pipe to anal canal). Of all, surgeries related to removal of gall bladder to get rid of stones or cancers, were the commonest. 
 
 Stating that reoperative surgeries had a much higher risk of complication, experts advised that both surgeons and patients need to be made aware about it.
