Navi Mumbai: After facing flak from motorists, activists and the traffic department, NMMC’s engineering wing has prepared a comprehensive proposal to widen the mouth of the Airoli   near Bharat Bijlee. 

 The subway which is a link to Thane-Belapur road has been a chronic bottleneck spot along the arterial and service road. 
 
 The   will ease the traffic flow as Thane-bound vehicles getting out of   node and station area can move smoothly without waiting for a green signal. Similarly, vehicles entering Airoli node from Thane-bound carriageway of TB road will have free access.
 
 According to the plan, a minimum 7 meter will be expanded from the existing 6m while shifting the pipelines, culvert and nullah. The width of the subway connecting TB road will be 13m where multiple vehicles can pass through easily. “A proposal has been submitted to the higher-ups for approval towards carrying out the widening work,” said Airoli executive engineer Sanjay Desai.
 
 Activist Sharad Bhat has been following up the issue for months. He wrote to the civic chief and concerned officials in NMMC to look into the matter. Based on his complaints, NMMC engineering section visited the traffic prone spot and conducted a ground survey to prepare the proposal for the widening on both Thane and   ends. 
 
 “The pile-up goes for a km along TB road. I have written to the concerned department to get the work done since there’s ample space in place for the revamp work. I have been assured of immediate remedial measure which is still awaited,” said Bhat.
 
 Residents alleged that sometimes the fire fighting engines get stuck in front of the fire station road. “The fire station road should be cleared from traffic for quick response to incidents. The road seems crowded all through the day due to the bottleneck at the subway junction,” said a local resident Vijay Patil.
