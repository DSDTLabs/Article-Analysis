PUDUCHERRY: Chief minister  , made a surprise visit to the chief secretariat at 9.30am on Monday, and was in for a shock. More than 70% of the staff had not arrived at the office whose work hours are from 8.45am to 1pm and 2pm to 5.45pm. 

 After ordering a pay cut for a day for the absentees, he found the   facility defunct. He inspected all the departments functioning in the five-storied building and found most seats empty. Only peons were present in most departments. Narayanasamy directed the chief secretary and secretaries to initiate stringent action against the latecomers including deducting a day's salary and disciplinary proceedings against those coming late often. He said he and his cabinet colleagues will undertake surprise inspections at government offices in future.
 
 The inspection was the result of frequent complaints of inordinate delay in getting   matters from officials. 
 
 "We chalked out a proposal to launch biometric attendance at  . Stern action will be taken against those using official vehicles for personal purposes as well," said Narayanaswamy.
 
  "We propose to constitute a committee to monitor and action against such people," he said.
