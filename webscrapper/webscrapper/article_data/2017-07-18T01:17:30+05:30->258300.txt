Navi Mumbai:   has shortlisted seven   for the Navi Mumbai corporate park project, touted to be the biggest real estate project to be conceived by a government agency in the state. 

  The seven architects are among 27 who had bid for designing the 120 hectares park. A planning department official said, “One of the seven will be selected in this fierce competition.” Based on the winning design, Cidco will sell the plots under urban design guidelines and implement the infrastructure of the project.
 
 The designing will be done with reference to some well-known global business parks in Canary Wharf, London, Vancouver, and Jurong (Singapore).
 
 “This corporate park will be different from Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC),” a Cidco official said. This complex will have more people-friendly features, the official added. 
 
 The revenue earned from the project, to be developed in phases, would depend on the rates at which plots will be sold and the approved FSI. The earnings have been pegged between Rs 20,000 crore to Rs 40,000 crore. 
 
 “We have not worked out the FSI yet,” a Cidco official said. Sources said the FSI will be pegged higher than the current FSI of 1.5 for commercial projects. “The state government had provided 2.5 FSI for BKC. We will finalise our proposal later,” sources in the town planning department said. Cidco’s board of directors will fix the FSI from their end and then forward it to the state government for its approval.
 
 The project has drawn global attention, with 14 of the 27 bids for the architect coming from international names and the rest domestic.
 
  It has been learnt that some big corporate houses will be purchasing plots in the complex for residential purposes. This project will thus have a mixed land use with differential FSI.
