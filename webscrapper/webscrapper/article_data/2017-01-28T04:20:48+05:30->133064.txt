NEW DELHI: The   (DSGMC) polls are all set to be held on February 26. With the state government and lieutenant governor Anil Baijal approving the election notification, the poll date and schedule is expected to be notified on February 1. DSGMC is a 55-member body with 46 elected members and 10 historical gurdwaras and 30 educational institutions come under its purview.

 This announcement has also kicked-in the election season in the capital where civic polls are expected to be held sometime in April.
 
 This election will be interesting as it will be held after the Punjab assembly polls, but before the results are announced in March. “We are ready to go to polls with the work done since 2013,” said the DSGMC president Manjeet Singh GK.
 
 Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) had won the DSGMC election in January 2013. The outcome of both the polls will be critical for the SAD (Badal)-BJP combine, the ruling dispensation in Punjab.
 
 The Committee polls will also be a testing ground for Shiromani Akali Dal (Delhi), which had led the DSGMC since 2002. SAD (Delhi) has always been backed by Congress.
 
 While there are rumours of AAP MLA Avtaar Singh Kalka floating a group backed by his party in the DSGMC polls, AAP Delhi convener Dilip Pandey denied any such development. “We are not contesting the  ,” he told TOI.
