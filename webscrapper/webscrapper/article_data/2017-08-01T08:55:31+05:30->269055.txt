ALLAHABAD: Allahabad HC on Monday allowed an application challenging the state government's order of May 3 declining sanction to prosecute UP CM Aditya Nath   in the   riot case of 2007.
Hearing a writ petition, a two-judge division bench allowed the amendment application moved by the petitioners and fixed August 9 for further hearing. The court granted two days' time to the state government to file its counter-affidavit against the amended pleadings.
 
 The court also expressed surprise on the contradictory arguments advanced by the advocate general and additional advocate general on whether a magistrate can apply judicial mind and proceed in a case in spite of state government's refusal of sanction to prosecute.
 
 Additional advocate general Manish Goel started his arguments with the contention that the magistrate, under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), has the power to apply judicial mind after grant or re fusal of sanction to prosecute by the state government. However, advocate general Raghvendra Singh intervened in the matter and argued that under CrPC provisions, a magistrate has no power to apply his judicial mind in case sanction has been refused. The petitioners had requested the court to direct an investigation by an independent agency into the FIR lodged at Cantt police station of Gorakhpur in 2008 against Yogi, who was   MP at that time, and three others. The FIR alleges that Yogi and then mayor of Gorakhpur Anju Chaudhri, then MLA Radha Mohan Agarwal and another person had incited communal violence and riot in Gorakhpur in 2007.
