LUCKNOW: The state capital has fared poor with 269th rank in  , scoring only 43% marks in overall score of 2000. Despite being capital of UP it ranked 10th in the state, much below other cities like Varanasi, Aligarh, Jhansi, Kanpur and Saharanpur etc. 

 Major setback for the city this year was its all India   rank slipping from earlier 28th to now 269th position, mainly because of poor performance in waste disposal, eradication of open defecation, construction of public/individual toilets and poor feedback from citizens. The worst performing parameter was eradication of open defecation and construction of toilets where Lucknow scored just 30 marks out of total score 270. 
 
 The ministry had allocated 2000 marks this time with 900 for overall   and cleanliness in city, 500 for third party inspection and 600 marks for residents’ feedback. Last year, Lucknow scored about 65% in sanitation and third party feedback but lost out in residents’ feedback with just 50% score. 
 
 This time too, it could encourage only 3,792 people in a population of 28 lakh to participate and give feedback and could score only 214 out of 600 marks which is less than 35%. Lucknow lost the battle mainly because of   pileup and LMC’s failure to supervise the private company handling door-to-door waste collection and garbage treatment. Despite starting city’s waste treatment plant in 2011, the company couldn’t cover even half of Lucknow wards and also failed miserably to treat even one-third of city’s daily generated waste.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner P K Srivastava said, “Sanitation carried 900 marks and we failed big time. It is time the previous agency was unable to process the waste and the new company was about to take over. The survey happened during the transition phase when most garbage was being dumped on roads and vacant plots.”
