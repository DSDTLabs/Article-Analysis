NAGPUR: The   (GDCH) in the city has finally got approval for two  , which is dentistry of children. It is for the first time that any   has got seats in this super-speciality in Maharashtra.

 These two seats will bring additional trained hands for treating children in the college and the   will be a boon for poor people.
 
 Admissions for the two seats will be done in the second round of PG admissions in 7-10 days. “It is a matter of pride for our college to get these two seats. Now, out of nine superspecialities, we have PG seats in all subjects except community dentistry which is a relatively new subject and there is shortage of teachers in this subject pan-India,” said GDC dean Dr Sindhu Ganvir.
 
 The   (DCI) conducted an inspection at GDCH for these seats about a year ago, and then sanctioned them in December. But admissions could not be conducted because a court case relating to PG admissions was being heard.
 
 Professor and head of the department of paedodontics, Dr Ritesh Kalaskar, told TOI that GDCH was one of the handful of colleges in the state to have the infrastructure and manpower for PG seats in the paediatric dentistry. “Our college alone has a conscious sedation equipment for children’s surgery and other procedures,” said Kalaskar.
 
 Kalaskar says that rendering dental treatment to children is extremely difficult. Each child has a different psychology and has to be dealt with accordingly. In fact, even parents need special counselling. The use of the conscious sedation machine does simplify the work of the doctor, but it is difficult to tell parents that the machine will administer nitrous oxide and oxygen to children during the procedure and sedate the child locally. “They are generally against general anaesthesia but many are not ready for conscious sedation either. Hence, the treating doctor has to understand the child and their family first,” said Kalaskar.
