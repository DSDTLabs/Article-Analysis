NAVI MUMBAI: Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner  , who withstood political pressure to crack down on land encroachers and illegal constructions in the region, was abruptly transferred on Friday evening without being assigned a post.

 In an order issued by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Mundhe was shifted out after a tenure that lasted less than a year. He was appointed in May 2016. N Ramaswami, inspector general of registration and controller of stamps, has been named the new commissioner.
 
 Demands for Mundhe's transfer began when he cracked down on illegal development and extensions including some owned by corporators. Mundhe had also targeted large-scale evasion of property tax and acted to streamline the tendering process for government work. Popular with residents, he was known for prompt action taken on the basis of information gleaned during his “Walk with the Commissioner“ events. Criticism for his apparent “unwillingness“ to work in tandem with corporators and for disregarding their views was sharp.
 
 A no-confidence motion was passed in the Navi Mumbai civic house against Mundhe after Shiv Sena joined hands with the ruling NCP-Congress coalition to back the move. It was passed by an overwhelming vote of 104 in a house of 111. “It was reason enough for the commissioner to be removed,'' said mayor Sudhakar Sonawane, who questioned Mundhe's “autocratic“ style of functioning.
 
 The transfer was a demand that both allies and leaders in opposition placed before the CM. To build pressure, the mayor threatened to resign on “moral grounds“. He met the CM and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray in October 2016 and later expressed satisfaction that the commissioner would be removed as “talks were fruitful.'' Five months later with the transfer actually through, Thackeray's role in resolving the contentious issue seems apparent, said party sources.
