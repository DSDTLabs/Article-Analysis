PUNE: The teaching staff of   (STES) colleges, on strike for over five months now, is conducting makeshift classes on the campus to help students with their doubts.

 The teachers have created a temporary help desk at the Wadgaon campus to assist students and are holding doubt-clearing sessions outside the cultural centre, on staircases, and other open spaces within the premises.
 
 Neha Godbole, a teacher, said, “Students should not suffer because of the issues between the management and the staff. They should continue to study. Thus, we decided to put up help desks to help them with their doubts.”
 
 Faculties from almost all the branches have put up a table and chair within the campus and running informal classrooms. Godbole said, “Students are studying themselves, but still come across many doubts. We are available for them between 8am and 8pm every day.”
 
 The teachers went on strike in November last year demanding a government-appointed administrator for the society or handing over the administration to the teaching staff. 
 
 The demand was raised against the backdrop of the   deciding to bar several STES colleges from admitting students in the 2018-19 session.
 
 “Over 15 months of salaries are pending. The management keeps making false promises, but now we have decided not to cooperate till our dues are cleared,” said an STES college staffer.
 
 
 
 
 The parents’ group met with the representatives of the Sinhgad society on Wednesday and demanded that the teachers resume their duties and complete the remaining syllabus in a month. Around 300 parents gathered at the Wadgaon campus and urged the society to pay the staff salaries without further delay. The group representatives have planned to meet education minister Vinod Tawde on March 9 to present their concerns.
