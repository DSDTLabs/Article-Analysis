  Agra: Fakkad Baba, a 73-year-old ascetic from Mathura, is well-known in the city of temples, mainly because he has been contesting elections for years. Following a prophecy by his guru, Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati of the Jagannath Puri peeth that he would win the 20th election he contested, the baba is now preparing to file his nomination papers for the 16th time.    Talking to TOI, the baba said, “All politicians are liars. Only ascetics like me can ensure honesty in public life and development for the people. I have complete faith in my guru’s prophecy and will surely be elected either an MLA or MP when my time comes.”    Fakkad Baba contested his first election in 1977 and got 8,000 votes and his journey has continued ever since. Interestingly, in every election he is the first to file his nomination papers. By now he has contested Lok Sabha elections eight times and assembly elections seven times from Mathura.    Times have changed for him. Pointing out that election expenses had been getting higher, Fakkad Baba said he has collected Rs 12,000 after selling his scooty and household utensils. “Of these, Rs 2,000 will be for my election expenses and Rs 10,000 as deposite for my nomination papers,” he added.    The ascetic is certain he will not win this time around too, but only succeed on his 20th attempt. He earns his living reciting the Ramayana, which he has done, by his own claim, at more than 13,000 houses in Mathura.    “I am from Kanpur and came to Mathura when I was 11. It has been my home ever since. It is my karmabhumi. I am committed to work for the people of this town and will one day serve them as their elected representative. Unlike politicians who forget their voters after being elected, I will ensure development of the city and its residents. I have no family of my own. It is the people of Mathura who are my family,” the baba added.
