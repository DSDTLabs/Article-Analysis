Last weekend saw the members of Compassion Unlimited Plus Action (CUPA) celebrate, as they inaugurated the new   Second Chance Adoption Centre. In a note to us, they said, “The much smaller centre that we had earlier was riddled with problems, like space constraints and frequent flooding during the rains. After facing its own set of challenges, the new centre at  , spread over an acre, is now up and running. It has fresh air, wide open spaces, crisp blue skies and nearly 80 happy   that are waiting eagerly for their forever homes.”
Diksha Kamat, one of the trustees of CUPA, says, “The land that we have is over two acres. We are using around 1.2 acre for the kennels, while the rest of the space will be reserved for animal activities. We also plan on having a swimming pool here as well as other facilities, which will allow the space to be utilized for pet and kids’ birthday parties too.”
 The new space, she adds, will be used mainly for rehabilitating rescued and abandoned dogs. “We have our main trauma care centre and other work going on in Hebbal. The space in Sarjapur will be used to keep rescued dogs. There are many expensive breeds too, so we want to ensure only those that are vaccinated and sterilized find a place in this  ,” says Diksha.
 The new shelter will keep dogs until they are eight years old and once older, they will be shifted to the geriatric care unit near the international airport. The new Sarjapur centre hopes to encourage more people to come and adopt rescued and abandoned animals.
