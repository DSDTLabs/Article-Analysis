Pune: Pune, Satara and Kolhapur are lagging behind in the land records updating programme. Only 70% work is complete even as chief minister Devendra Fadnavis dedicated the service to provide online 7/12 extracts with digital signatures to the state for nearly 30,000 villages on May 1.  The prime focus areas for Pune division which comprises Pune, Satara, Sangli, Solapur and Kolhapur would be the updating of land records and to execute government projects and cater to the issues of farmers, pending loan waiver cases, women and the youth, Deepak Mhaisekar, divisional commissioner (holding charge) and additional divisional commissioner, who took charge on Wednesday, said. He said he had conducted a review of the division and found there was a connectivity problem and he would set a target for updating in three months.  “Pune district recorded only 72.84% of updating of records, Satara was at 71% and Kolhapur was at 60%. Within the next two months, work should be completed as the state government is keen that from August it should be fully operational in all the districts,’’ Mhaisekar said. Sangli and Solapur were at 99%, he added.  The tanker demand in Pune division during the scorching summer has not been as much as in Marathwada and Vidarbha divisions of the state, he said.  They were seeking regular reports from Groundwater Survey Development Agency (GSDA) regarding groundwater depletion, he said. “We had good rains last year so the situation is better this year,’’he added. Former divisional commissioner Chandrakant Dalvi introduced the zero pendency programme. Mhaisekar, the divisional commissioner who is holding charge, said there would be special focus on the areas lagging behind. Mhaisekar took charge as additional divisional commissioner, a special post. He is also holding charge as Pune divisional commissioner after Dalvi retired on March 31.
