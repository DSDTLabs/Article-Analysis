PATNA: PM Narendra Modi is likely to attend the ceremony at which Nitish Kumar will be administered   as Bihar CM for the sixth time at 5pm on Thursday.

 Nitish tendered his resignation on Wednesday evening severing ties with RJD and Congress after RJD boss Lalu Prasad’s son and deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav declined to resign following CBI raids against him in a land graft case.
 
 The schedule of the oath ceremony was decided at a meeting of the JD (U) and NDA legislators at the CM’s official residence around 10pm. BJP functionaries confirmed Nitish was formally elected leader of the new alliance’s legislature party.
 
 State BJP’s media in-charge Ashok Bhatt said Union health minister J P Nadda and party’s national general secretary Anil Jain would also attend the function at Raj Bhawan. The duo will reach Patna by a service flight at 8.30am.
 
 Officiating governor Keshari Nath Tripathi, who was admitted to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences for the treatment of a nose infection on Wednesday evening, was discharged late in night.
