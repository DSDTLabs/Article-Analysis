PANAJI: After January 15, four more road transport offices (RTOs) in the state will upgrade to the new softwares Vahan 4.0 and   4.0. “We have to have the entire functioning of the RTOs under Vahan and Sarathi’s upgraded versions. The idea is to decongest crowds coming to the offices,” a transport official said.

 The Union ministry had introduced the online-based citizen-centric application Vahan for driving licences and Sarathi for registration of vehicles. 
 
 The 2.0 version of the applications were being used at the office level by transport officials. The 4.0 version is therefore an upgrade of the already existing systems at the state department’s RTOs.
 
 TOI had reported last year that RTO Panaji was the first in Goa to upgrade to this system.
 
 The system was later adopted in   and   RTOs, giving citizens the privilege of registering vehicles and applying for licences from the comfort of their home. Mid-January, the system will be operated in Vasco, Quepem, Canacona and Dharbandora.
 
 Other than this, driving licences are being mailed to applicants by post since November 2017 onwards. “There has been a 15% decrease in people queueing up at the RTOs since then,” the official said.
