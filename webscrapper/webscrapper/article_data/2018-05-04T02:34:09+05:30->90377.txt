NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday told the   government to show its bona fides by releasing at least 2 tmc feet Cauvery water to   by Tuesday and ordered the Centre to file an affidavit detailing steps taken to frame the scheme on inter-state sharing of river water in accordance with the SC’s February 16 judgment. 

 
 “Let them not play foul with the   judgment. Release 4 tmc feet water, at least 2 tmc feet by Tuesday. Come with a positive attitude on Tuesday or face consequences. We can take suo motu contempt,” a bench of CJI Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud warned Karnataka, which goes to polls on May 12. However, the SC order merely said the counsel would take instructions from the state government. 
 
 Karnataka’s counsel Shyam Divan and advocate general M R Naik said the state had released more water than what was envisaged under the Cauvery Tribunal Award and there was no plea by Tamil Nadu seeking release of water or violation of the SC judgment. Attorney general K K Venugopal told the court that the Centre would require more time to frame the scheme envisaged by the court in its February 16 judgment as it required approval by the Union cabinet. 
 
 “The cabinet could not meet as the PM was abroad and after coming back has gone to Karnataka for campaigning,” he said and requested the court to post the matter for hearing after May 12. Tamil Nadu, through senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, said, “Not only the summer temperature but temperature over Cauvery water is rising in Tamil Nadu as the SC’s judgment is not getting implemented even after two months.
