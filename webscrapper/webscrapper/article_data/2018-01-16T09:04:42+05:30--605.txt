MANGALURU: Close on the heels of the murder of   leader  , an audio clip threatening to kill those suspected of killing him has gone viral.

 In the 37-second clip, a man says in the Beary dialect that the murderers of Eliyas will meet the same fate as him.
 
 “Agree that Eliyas used to be a rowdy. However, he was a changed man… He had promised that he would travel to Mecca and then mend old ways. Everything was fine… He was suddenly killed. Who killed him?   and Safwan. They have now escaped. Eliyas supporters are in jail. If released, they (Dawood and Safwan) are gone,” the person says. 
 
 While some of Eliyas’ aides are in jail for various crimes, others are free. The identity of the person in the audio clip is yet to be established. According to sources, it could be the handiwork of Imran alias Immu, known to be the right-hand man of Eliyas. He may have recorded the audio as a warning before attempting to avenge the murder.
 
 Imran reportedly did not even eat for a few days after the news of Eliyas’ murder spread.
 
 Mangaluru City police commissioner   said: “I’ve directed the investigating officer to ascertain where the audio clip was recorded. We’re tracking down the person.”
 
 A gang barged in to the apartment of Eliyas in Jeppu, Kudapaddy, on January 13 morning and stabbed him to death when his 2-year-old daughter, mother-in-law and brother-in-law were in the house. He had been released on bail just three days before the murder.
