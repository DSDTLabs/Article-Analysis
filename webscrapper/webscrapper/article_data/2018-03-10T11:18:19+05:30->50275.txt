NEW DELHI: The government on Friday said the US plan to go beyond the agreed cap on import duty on steel and aluminium had triggered concerns, but said it would wait for details to emerge before deciding on future course of action. The statement came as it emerged that 17 countries — including China, EU, Mexico and India — had flagged their concerns over protectionist measures from the US at a meeting of WTO’s General Council earlier this week. The issue came up after China insisted on discussions on the special agenda item.

 India’s ambassador to the   J S Deepak told reporters that there were no concerns over the government’s decision to raise import duty on 40 items in the Budget as they remained within-bound rates or the highest levy that a country has committed to levy. But the US move to raise duties on two products had resulted in a global “disquiet”, he said.
 
 “India is not a protectionist country and it has always kept duties within the WTO bound rates,” commerce secretary Rita Teaotia said. “Of course, there will be some impact on India as it is an exporter. We will wait to see what form it will take.”
 
 US President Donald   has signed two proclamations that levied a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% duty on aluminium imported from all countries, except Canada and Mexico. The new tariffs come into effect in 15 days.
 
 While Trump has also suggested imposing reciprocal duties against countries such as India and China, officials said, the move was not possible under the WTO regime given the “most favoured nation” status. This binds them to levy the same duty on an imported product, irrespective of the source country. Asked about the US demand to lower import duty on super-bikes, such as Harley Davidson, Teaotia said India has its own ‘Make in India’ and is largest producer of motor bikes. She said the government had calibrated duties once sectors stabilised and the policy will continue.
