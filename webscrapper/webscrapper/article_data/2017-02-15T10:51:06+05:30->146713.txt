GUWAHATI: The latest National Family Health Survey-4 reveals only 44.6% of women in Assam are aware that consistent use of condom can reduce the chances of contracting  . 

 The figure is only slightly better than that of Bihar (33.5%) and Gujarat (43.2%). Neighbouring states like Manipur (79%),   (47%), Sikkim (62.7%) and Tripura (57%) have all fared better than Assam. 
 
 Till December 31, 2014, a total of 9,991 HIV-positive cases were detected in Assam, of which 3,445 were women. Even though Assam is categorised as a low HIV-prevalence state, the number of new HIV infection cases annually has risen at a rate of 2.5% from 1,219 in 2007 to 2,408 in 2011.
 
 The estimated adult HIV-prevalence rate in the state is 0.6% against the national prevalence of 0.26%. The rate is, however, higher than the 0.04% recorded in 2007.
 
 AIDS experts attribute this to the society's gender roles and the taboo surrounding contraceptive methods.
 
 "What is made available is for the males. Gender role has a role to play in Assam's low awareness among women about the use of condoms and its effect on the prevention of HIV. It is important that awareness be made inclusive," said SI Ahmed, one of the first medical practitioners in the state to do an enhanced study on the AIDS scenario in the region, and the chairman of the Assam Prevention Society.
 
 HIV-positive women continue to face difficulties in terms of property rights, face social stigma from both within their families and outside in the society, and have to encounter discrimination in all walks of life.
 
 "Most women from poor economic background, who are not well-educated and not aware of the afflictions, bear the brunt. Their family ties are severed just because they are HIV-positive," an AIDS activist said.
