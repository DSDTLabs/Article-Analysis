AMRITSAR: Though former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu is yet to formally join the Congress, on Wednesday his wife Dr   and Punjab Congress vice-president   claimed that he would the party’s candidate from   assembly constituency.

 “Tentatively, Sidhu will contest from my constituency that is Amritsar East,” said Dr Navjot, adding that final decision would be of the Congress high command. Verka also confirmed the development.
 
 Dr Navjot said high-level deliberations were in progress and most likely Sidhu’s name would be announced before January 10. “We have worked in Amritsar East constituency for the past five years and general sentiments are against the SAD-BJP government,” she said on her husband’s prospects in the segment. She said that the Congress workers were united and would give a thumping victory to Sidhu.
 
 Verka said, “Rahul Gandhi, Captain   and Sidhu are discussing the issue for the past several days. Very soon, Sidhu will come to Amritsar and contest the elections. He will also campaign across the state for the party.”
 
 During the last assembly elections, Dr Navjot had polled 33,406 votes as against 26,307 votes secured by her nearest rival Simerpreet Kaur, a lesser known candidate who had contested as an independent. Cricketer-turned-politician Sidhu had also campaigned for his wife in the 2012 elections.
 
 “I have worked for over 10 years in Amritsar East constituency, and it is my right to claim the ticket,” said former mayor of Amritsar Sunil Dutti, one of the ticket aspirant from the Congress. Dutti said despite Punjab Congress chief Amarinder stating that the Amritsar East seat was vacant for Sidhu, he would continue to stake his claim.
 
 Another ticket aspirant from same constituency and former   also claimed to have worked hard in the area and said he was the senior most Congress claimant for the ticket.
