CHANDIGARH: Disheartened by  , members of Panchkula Animal Welfare Association have started a new  . They got around 70 collars for Rs 50-60 each from Indore and are now planning to order more.

 The main idea was given by   and executed by her, Neenu Sodhi, Nidhi Anad, Gunjan Rastogi, and Ivneet Kataria.
 
 “We have started to put neon collars on dogs  . I really want to thank Rimjhim and Tushar from Indore for providing us the collars. They had been using them there and we have adopted the same here keeping in view the growing number of accidents involving dogs,” said Meenakshi.
 
 “Recently, five to six accidents were reported in Panchkula itself. The most recent was of an abandoned Labrador that died after a day of treatment. On July 23, one more accident was reported,” she said. 
 
 The group members are further planning to extend the drive with the help of other animal lovers from the Tricity. “On Facebook, we are promoting the initiative as more the word spreads, the more dogs will be safe. If anyone wants the collars, they can contact us. The idea is to reach out to as many dogs,” she added.
 
 They are also planning to write phone numbers on them and stick them with the help of glue so that they are not stolen. “Two of the collars that we put on dogs in Sector 5, Panchkula got stolen on Sunday. We are trying to ensure it doesn’t happen again,” she said.
 
 They have put collars on around 35 dogs so far.
