KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia will allow a US-based exploration firm to resume the search for   flight  , an airline support group told families of the victims on Friday, in a bid to solve one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries.

 Flight MH370, carrying 239 people, disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014. The plane was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew.
 
 The governments of Malaysia, China and Australia called off the 1,046-day official search on January 17 last year. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau's final report on the search conceded that authorities were no closer to knowing the reasons for the plane's disappearance, or its exact location.
 
 An email, sent from the MH Family Support Centre and seen by Reuters, said the Malaysian government had accepted an offer by the company,  , to resume the search on a "no cure, no fee" basis, meaning the company will only get paid if they find the plane.
 
 A government spokesman declined to confirm that an email had been sent to families but said more details on the deal would be forthcoming. Ocean Infinity did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
 
 Investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the transponder of the Boeing 777 before diverting it over the  .
 
 Several pieces of aircraft debris have been collected from Indian Ocean islands and along Africa's east coast, with at least three being confirmed as being from the missing plane. 
 
 
 
 
 The search vessel named Seabed Constructor left the South African port of Durban on Tuesday as part of the Ocean Infinity company's plan to look for debris in the southern Indian Ocean. The ship has unmanned submarines that can descend deep into the ocean.
 
 Ocean Infinity was taking advantage of favorable weather to move the vessel toward "the vicinity of the possible search zone," the company said in a statement.
