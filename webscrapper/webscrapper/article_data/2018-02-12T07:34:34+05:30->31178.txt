CHANDIGARH:   industries minister   on Sunday gave Rs 1.5 crore for the construction of homes for 101 poor families of Varanasi on the wedding of his niece that was solemnized in New Delhi on Sunday.

 Besides providing homes to 101 poor families under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, Goels also solemnized marriages of 31 poor girls from the same pandal where his niece   got married. Prime Minister   represents Varanasi parliamentary constituency.   in a letter complemented   on his noble initiative and advised others to follow his example.
 
 Unlike typical fat weddings, which Goel’s community generally witnesses, the wedding was a simple affair with a special community kitchen for thousands of guests present at the ceremony. Most of the guests were invited through a WhatsApp message. “This (decision) was a message for all rich and famous people that instead of spending lavishly in marriages, we should encourage spending of this amount for community welfare. Public representatives must set such examples,” maintained Goel.
 
 Prominent leaders like   minister Krishan Pal Gurjar, RSS Haryana in charge   and state minister Rao Narbir Singh and other senior leaders attended the simple ceremony. Others who were present included Anil Jain, Haryana BJP incharge, and Dinesh Chandra, senior leader of the VHP. “This is the real spirit of ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padao’ campaign. Such initiatives are always helpful for society,’’ said Jain.
