GUMLA: The   south Chotanagpur division on Tuesday accused the   government of 'forcibly' amending the   (SNT) and   (SPT) Acts. 

 "We would rather face bullets than allow the evil designs of the government to be implemented," JMM chief Shibu Soren said while addressing party workers at a meeting here on Tuesday.
 
 Soren added that   was created for the development and progress of the people but the government's move would now force them to migrate in search of livelihood.
 
 Former chief minister Hemant Soren also took a jibe at the government and said accused it of amending the Acts only to evacuate the tribals from their ancestral land in the name of development. 
 
 If the protest to safeguard the very existence (lands) is anti-development, protests will continue, Hemant said.
