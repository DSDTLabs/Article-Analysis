NEW DELHI: On a day the   showcased its “achievements” on completing three years, opposition   staged a protest outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence. Gathered in large numbers, BJP workers shouted slogans against the government for its “failure” to deliver on its poll promises.

 “In the past three years, the government has failed on every promise it made to the people of the city, whether it was about installing 15 lakh CCTV cameras, giving free Wi-Fi services, deploying marshals in DTC buses, or providing free water,” Delhi BJP unit chief   said, adding that the government had pushed the city back by 30 years.
 
 Referring to the disqualification of AAP MLAs in office-of-profit case, Tiwari said, “They use to preach everyone about honesty. And now their 20 MLAs have been disqualified by the President because they broke all laws.” He charged Kejriwal with lying, alleging that not a single new hospital or college had been opened in the last three years.
 
 “Even the condition of government hospitals is very bad these days,” he said. Tiwari accused the CM of only suggesting “closing down things or doing drama” whenever Delhi sees any problem. “When pollution level rises, he says shut down Delhi and implement odd-even. When ammonia level in water goes up, he talks of stopping water supply,” he said.
 
 Vijender Gupta, leader of opposition in Delhi assembly, alleged that the AAP government had not done anything to curb corruption. “They have not made any law to check corruption. No new bill has been presented in the assembly in the last two years,” he said.
 
 BJP plans to hold public meetings on various issues in the coming week and present a white paper on the performance of the Kejriwal government. On Thursday, it will hold demonstrations at various places in the city.
