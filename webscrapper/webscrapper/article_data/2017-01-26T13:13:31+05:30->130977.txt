 The university has decided that once it receives the papers regarding Choondawat’s arrest it will seek a legal opinion on the matter before starting the process of his suspension.
 
 “We were told by the Jodhpur police that they have dispatched the papers regarding his arrested through speed post. We are waiting for that,” said MSU’s in-charge vice-chancellor professor M N Parmar. 
 
 According to Jodhpur’s anti-corruption bureau ( ), Choondawat, who was arrested on Saturday was in 2012 invited as an external expert in a selection committee for appointments at sociology department of JNVU.
 
 Another ground on which   can take disciplinary action against Choondawat, who is on verge of retirement, is the fact that although he had applied for leave between January 13 and January 19, he has failed to officially communicate to the university the reason behind his extended leave.
