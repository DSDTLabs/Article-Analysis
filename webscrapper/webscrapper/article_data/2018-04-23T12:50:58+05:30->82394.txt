BAREILLY: Union minister of state for labour and employment   kicked up a row when he said rape incidents are "unfortunate but cannot be stopped sometimes". Talking to reporters in Bareilly on Saturday evening, Gangwar said, "The government is taking action. One or two such incidents in a big country like India should not be hyped so much." 

 Asked about   gang rape and murder, Gangwar, who is Bareilly MP, said, "Such incidents are unfortunate, but cannot be stopped sometimes. However, the government is alert and taking action and it is visible to everyone. Itne bade desh me ek do ghatna ho jaye to kevel usko hi batangar bana kar kaam kiya jaye, ye bhi uchit nahi hai (One or two rape cases in a big country like India should not by hyped)."
 
 Soon after this, he wrote several posts on his Twitter account to clarify his stand. "I have said that media should not twist (my) statement and act responsibly. This (rape) is a very serious and sensitive matter. Our government under leadership of   ji is very sensitive and it is government's progressive step to safeguard children and women. Ordinance is a step towards same (sic)." 
 
  When TOI contacted him on Sunday, Gangwar again said, "I did not say anything and media twisted my statement.'' 
 
  Later in the day, PM Modi issued a gag order to all   MPs and MLAs. Interacting with party lawmakers and legislators through the Narendra Modi App on Sunday, he advised them to steer clear of making controversial statements before the media. 
 
  "We commit mistakes and give masala to media. The moment we see a camera, we jump to make a statement as if we are great social scientists or experts ... and then these ill-informed statements are used by media. It is not the fault of media," he said. 
 
 In the past few months, party's leaders have issued controversial statements on a range of topics, including Darwin's theory and use of internet in Mahabharata.
