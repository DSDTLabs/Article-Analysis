MUMBAI: Seven   department officials, including the   prison  , were suspended on Friday for their alleged involvement in a bribe-for-meeting-inmates scandal.

 The suspended officials are three constables from Arthur Road jail, three from Thane central prison and the jailer. 
 
 The alleged scandal came to light after a student, Amit Mishra, who was once not allowed to meet a relative in the Thane jail, started filming his visits to prisons and recording every encounter where he had to pay a bribe to officials. He conducted sting operations at the Thane jail, Taloja jail, Arthur Road jail and Kalyan jail.
 
 Mishra alleged that earlier when he approached jail authorities to complain about the corruption, no one believed him. He has filmed more than half a dozen cases where jail staffers are seen demanding bribe to fix a meeting with inmates. 
 
 In one of the videos shot at the Thane jail, Mishra is seen approaching a constable saying he wanted to take his jailed friendâ€™s signature on bail paper. The constable demands Rs 2,000 from Mishra to get the documents signed. Another constable seeks Rs 3,000 for arranging a meeting with a friend in the jail. 
 
 In another video, a Kalyan jail constable demanded Rs 2 lakh to get an inmate admitted to a hospital. In Arthur Road prison, the jailer was caught on camera demanding Rs 2 lakh for getting an inmate admitted to hospital.
 
 Rajvardhan Sinha, inspector general of police (prisons), had ordered superintendents of all jails to submit detailed inquiry reports into the allegations.
