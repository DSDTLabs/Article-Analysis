DHARAMSHALA:   increase with snow in upper hills as   to lower areas. Traps set to maim or catch these animals also leads to   in the region.

  have witnessed a sharp rise in incidents where stray animals particularly cows,   can be seen palpitating in severe pain with bleeding wounds in sheer winters.
 
 Traps are of two types Â­ one made from a brake wire which ensnares the animal and slowly tightens, and the other a firecracker hidden in food which explodes inside the animal's mouth. Both of these traps catch innocent animals, causing their slow and painful death.
 
 Working for the welfare of stray animals, American activist   said she had came across seven such cases in a month. "A cow had stepped in a wire trap which had completely cut off its foot near the bus stand.Another cow in Palampur had bitten an explosive trap hidden inside a chapati, which burst in its mouth and completely fractured and unhinged the jaw. Both died slowly over a week's time," she said.
 
 Another activist, Yogesh Kumar, said one dog had a wire trap caught around his middle which slowly cut into his body over two weeks and caused his internal organs to come out.
 
 An activist at Peepal Farm in Chambi, where wounded stray animals treated, said survival of animals wounded in the trap is rare. "Those who survive, are left permanently disfigured. The traps are so deeply hidden that it is only a matter of time before a child inadvertently becomes maimed," said a representative there.
 
 Activists said police should intervene before such traps are used more often due to the easy availability of cheap materials used in these.They also raised the issue with the district administration to create awareness among common people.
