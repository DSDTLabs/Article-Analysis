GAYA: CM   Kumar will visit Suggi village, the Open Defecation-Free (ODF) hamlet of   panchayat in Amas block of   district on Sunday, as part of his ongoing Nishchay Yatra.

 The CM will assess the ground-level impact of his vow to provide basic amenities, including tap water, electricity and toilet etc, to all households.
 
 All the households of the village have been provided tap water, electricity and toilet, Gaya DM Kumar Ravi said, adding open defecation has ended in the village. 
 
 When reminded that construction of toilet does not mean automatic end of the open defecation habit, the DM said Jeevika activists have been extensively involved in creating awareness about the harmful effects of open defecation and the villagers have voluntarily started using toilets.
 
 Gayaites recall a similar campaign in   panchayat of Amas block failed as people complained of water deficiency and proximity of toilets to cooking area in small houses. 
 
 “This time such concerns and apprehensions have been taken into account,” the DM said and added availability of tap water would ensure supply of enough water to flush out the human excreta.
 
 The CM will interact with the villagers to have a first hand account of hiccups, if any. He will also visit   temple in the afternoon and thereafter review the progress of the ongoing development projects with senior officials of the five districts of Magadh division.
