Patna: It will be a give and take between Nitish Kumar’s JD (U) and Congress in the upcoming Punjab assembly polls.

 The JD (U) wants accommodation of its candidates by Congress if the grand old party wants Nitish to campaign for it in  . Punjab Congress chief Capt Amarinder Singh had extended invitation to Nitish to campaign for Congress during his visit to Bihar during Prakashotsava.
 
 JD (U) general secretary K C Tyagi said Nitish has very good personal relation spanning over three decades with Punjab CM Prakash Singh Badal and his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal, whose Aam Aadmi Party is also in the fray.
 
 “It was only Congress chief Amarinder Singh who invited Nitish ji and requested him to campaign for the party. The JD (U) has a good support base in Punjab. However, the party may think of an alliance with Congress in the northern state only if the grand old party agrees to allot tickets to its candidates,” Tyagi said. He did not specify the number of candidates the JD (U) wants Congress to accommodate.
 
 Asked what will be the stand of JD (U) in case Congress does not accommodate its candidates, Tyagi said, “If our candidates are not accommodated, we will have to think our future strategy. Our party leadership will take a final call keeping in mind all aspects.” 
 
 On whether JD (U) will jump into the fray alone, Tyagi said Nitish will take the final call. 
 
 Sources in JD (U) said the party would not hesitate in contesting Punjab polls alone as it has good support base there and good response by Sikhs, who visited Bihar for Prakashotsava, will go a long way in helping the party to establish its base in the state. “The Sikh community has seen the good governance model of   and they would definitely vote for JD (U) candidates or the party which is supported by us,” said JD (U) sources.
