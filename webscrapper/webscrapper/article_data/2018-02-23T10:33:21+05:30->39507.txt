CHANDIGARH: An open ground located in Sector 38-West near   has been bearing the brunt of the lack of any dumpster nearby. The ground has turned into an open air dumping zone with mountains of debris and garbage scattered all around the ground, which is located almost parallel to the arterial road dividing Sector 38-West and   Colony. 

 "This place was once completely empty. There was no filth, garbage or debris here. Eventually with time, a lot of people started throwing garbage here, due to the absence of dumpsters nearby. A lot of construction labourers, who work at various construction sites in Sector 38-West and Dadu Majra, now come and dump all the debris into the open ground," said  , a Sector 38-West resident. 
 
 The presence of garbage and debris in the locality has also paved way for stray animals to come and inhabit this side of the ground. They can be often seen feeding on the disposed garbage and thus end up scattering the same at different locations. They are also creating a problem for numerous passers-by living in Dadu Majra Colony, who are now concerned about encountering stray animals on their way. 
 
 The ground,which was once used for recreational purposes of the nearby children, has now been reduced to a makeshift   which has contributed to polluting the vicinity immensely. 
 
 The concerned   official, when contacted to get a response on the issue, remained out of reach.
