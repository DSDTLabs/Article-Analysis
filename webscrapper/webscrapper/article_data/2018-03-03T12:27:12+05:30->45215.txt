 “We’ve never known anything like it at the British Library,” lead curator Julian Harrison said. “It was a first for us, every day we had queues of people desperate to get in. We could see from the expressions of joy and surprise on many faces as they came that they’d never been in the library before – but we also got many visitors who had never read and had no particular interest in the Harry Potter books, but were just fascinated by the history of magic and the treasures of our collections relating to it,” added Harrison.
 
 The collection included included crystal balls, spells, wands, brooms and cauldrons owned by people, who claimed to be real 20th-century witches. They came to London on loan from the collection of the Museum of Witchcraft and Magic in Boscastle, Cornwall. There were original drafts and drawings by J.K. Rowling and illustrator  , both on display for the first time and several other things to explore not just the world which J.K. Rowling created but the world that inspired it.
