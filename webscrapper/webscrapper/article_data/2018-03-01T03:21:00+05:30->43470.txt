The relics of   of Padua, one of the most popular saints in the Catholic church, will be displayed for public viewing and veneration at Averno Frirary, Monte De Guirim, and Padre Pio Friary, Navelim. 
 
 Coming from Padua, Italy, the two ‘first-class’ relics will be open for veneration at Monte De Guirim from the morning of March 2 till the afternoon of March 3, and at the Padre Pio Friary from the afternoon of March 3 till the afternoon of March 4. 
  
 One reliquary contains the smallest rib bone of the saint and the other a fragment of his petrified flesh in a bust. 
  
 Saint Anthony is known to millions of Catholics as the patron saint of lost and stolen articles. People pray to him for restoring anything they may have lost from tangible objects such as keys, to more profound aspects such as faith, a sense of purpose, etc. A view of his relics is believed to help Catholics cope with the loss of faith, family harmony, health, peace of mind, as well as material things. 
  
 There are three classes of sacred relics. The first class is a part of the saint’s body, the second, a piece of his/her clothing or something used by him/her, and the third, an object touched to a first-class relic. St Anthony died on June 13, 1231, and was buried in a little church outside the walls of Padua. In 1263, his remains were transferred to a newly constructed basilica. When his coffin was opened, bones and ashes were found, but his vocal apparatus was intact. His tongue, in particular, was still red and soft. That was deemed a miracle. 
  
 In 2005, Pope Benedict Emeritus said of the relics: “By inviting us to venerate the mortal remains of martyrs and saints, the Church does not forget that, in the end, these are indeed just human bones, but they are bones that belonged to individuals touched by the living power of God.”
