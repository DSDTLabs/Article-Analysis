PUNE: It may be entirely unrelated to its directives and function but the  's ( ) website features a detailed explanation on writing essays in the 'news' section. This comes as a shocker at a time when the government is pushing towards a Digital India. 

 In fact, the error has existed since the portal was launched in 2014. The website has been due for a major overhaul, pending approval from the board, an official stated.
 
  According to Rahul  , officer-in-charge of the board's Pune office, "MSBB was constituted in 2012. A year later, there were two options to upload the website by having the   (NIC) develop it and subsequently maintain it, or by doing it ourselves. The decision was taken to develop the website in-house due to paucity of time." 
 
 A local web developer was contracted to build the website based on a template from a popular web platform and the website went live in 2014. "Some sections of the template used were left behind and came to the notice of the board at a later time. The website is managed from the MSBB head office in Nagpur. However, since we do not have a dedicated web developer on the board staff, it has been difficult to follow the regular updating cycle," Mungikar explained.
 
 Lack of timely updates have also made the security of the page vulnerable.
