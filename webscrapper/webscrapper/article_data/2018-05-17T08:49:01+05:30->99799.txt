CHENNAI: The lure of a career in the corporate sector remains high and   continues to be the most sought-after course in city colleges, but the   for basic science courses has also gained momentum, with many reputed institutions running out of applications. 

 On Wednesday, soon after the Class XII board exam results were out, long queues were spotted outside most colleges despite the entire admissions process being made online. Almost every   has set up a temporary guidance cell, offering advice to students and their parents on selecting courses as well as on the scope for employment and higher studies in the various courses.
 
 When TOI correspondents posing as students approached the guidance cells, staff manning them said that only those with scores of 90 % and above stood a chance in securing a B.Com seat. 
 
 On the continued high demand for B Com, Dr C R Ravi, former principal of a government aided college, said, “It has become a time-tested course and students believe that they have some future in banking, financing and accounting by opting for this.” 
 
 The demand for basic science courses has also shot up with many probably believing that engineering may not take them far and that they have better options if they pursue post graduation courses or undertake a Ph.D after a basic science course like B Sc (physics) or B Sc (chemistry). 
 
 N Shettu, general secretary of the Association of University Teachers said there was a popular misconception that taking up a CA (Chartered Accountant) course gets easy after B Com. “This is not true as anyone can take up CA after completing a UG course. As far as life sciences are concerned, B Sc (zoology) and B Sc (botany) are getting more attention of late. Many of these students have excelled in researches with the help of increased exposure attained through these courses.”
