THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Congress high command has begun discussions to appoint an interim president for the   in the state. 

 Mukul Wasnik, the AICC general secretary who is in charge of Kerala affairs, has started discussions in this regard with senior leaders of the party in the state.
 
 The party high command has decided to go for an interim president instead of a full time state chief for the time being, it is learnt, as it needs more time to have discussions with all the leaders and reach a consensus before finalising a full time president.
 
 However, the party in the state is divided over the choice of an interim president too. Both the ‘I’ and ‘A’ factions want their nominees to be made as the new interim president. 
 
 Even though both the groups are supporting the view that the interim president should be selected from among the current vice-presidents, each group is particular about choosing its own nominee for the post.
 
 When ‘A’ group is demanding to make senior most vice -resident   as the interim president, the ‘I’ group wants   in the post. 
 
 Lack of consensus among the groups may force the party high command to choose a neutral candidate from outside the present committee.
 
 P T Thomas and K V Thomas are the two neutral names being considered if the groups are not ready to end their fight for the president’s post. 
 
 But, for sure, the party high command will be taking the view of both   and   before finalizing the name unlike last time when   chose V M Sudheeran, despite the opposition from Chennithala and Chandy.
