 According to sources at NTPC, “While multiple air pollution sources have been recognised, open burning of biomass has been identified as one of the major causes of poor air quality in northern India, especially in and around Delhi.” 
 
 In order to curb air pollution, NTPC’s procurement of agro residue based biomass pellets has ensured approximately 200 metric tonnes per day of agro residue based fuel at NTPC Dadri which will generate approximately 150 MU of renewable electricity annually.
