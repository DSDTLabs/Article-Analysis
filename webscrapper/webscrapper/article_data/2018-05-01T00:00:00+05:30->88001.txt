After Maheshinte Prathikaram and Thondimuthalum Drikshakshiyum, actor   will be doing a completely different character in debutant director Vivek’s Aanenkilum Allenkilum. In the movie, he will be seen as a carefree, urban playboy. The actor will be romancing South Indian actress   as well.
 
 “Aanenkilum Allenkilum was announced a year ago as a   project. It was delayed as Fahadh had to grow out his beard for Trance as well as the Amal Neerad movie. He is done with the shoot of both and we are going on floors on May 7,” says the director.
  
 The movie would also mark Catherine’s comeback to Mollywood after Prithviraj’s The Thriller in 2010. “She plays a village belle in the film who resides in Koottickal, Kottayam. The story is completely set against a Christian backdrop,” he says, adding that the actress is excited to return to Mollywood through the film.
  
 According to Vivek, the movie, which has a romance, also falls into the funeral-comedy genre. “It is a complete entertainer and is shot in Bengaluru, Pondicherry and Koottickal. It is also a story about friendship and as Sunny is busy with  , we have roped in Sharafudheen to play the role,” he says, adding that the film will also have Renji Panicker, Dharmajan Bolgatty, Alencier Lopez and Thesni Khan.
