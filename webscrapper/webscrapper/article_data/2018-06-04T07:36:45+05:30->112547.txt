LUCKNOW: Now, students of Lucknow   and its affiliated colleges will have access to advanced scientific instruments. These instruments will prove helpful in conducting research in various branches of science like zoology, geology, botany and biochemistry.

 A centralised instrumentation facility will be set up at LU zoology department for undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD students from the new academic session.
 
 A sum of Rs 1.9 crore has been allocated for it. Until now, LU students had to visit other scientific institutions for conducting advanced experiments.
 
 “The central instrumentation facility will have three instruments funded by DST-FIST. The setting up of this facility will help a number of students produce international level scientific research papers,” said head of zoology department Prof Omkar.
 
 He said the university will also get a multi-reader — a multi-purpose instrument used for studying biological aspects like cellular structure, protein and scientific aspects of plants and animals.
