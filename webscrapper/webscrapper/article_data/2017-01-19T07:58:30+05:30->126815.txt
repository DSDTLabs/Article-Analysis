CHARMINAR: The Telangana government and the   have locked horns over the allotment of office space with the former threatening to evict the minorities panel from Raghava Sadan, a government building at  , treating the occupation as “unauthorised“.

 The State Minorities Commission (SMC) is yet to be bifurcated and is functioning for both states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
 
 In a fresh round of jousting, the office of the estate of ficer, in a letter to chairman Abid Rasool Khan, reiterated the stand of Telangana advocate general who contended that the minorities commis sion is “non-existent“ given that its term had expired in May last year.
 
 “In view of the above facts, the occupation of the respon dent in the public premises in question i.e. Govt Bldg No.1248, Raghava Sadan, Hyderabad is treated as unauthorised and liable to be evicted from the suit premises under the provisions of sub section (h) of section 2 of the   (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1968 (sic),“ an excerpt from the letter issued to SMC reads.
 
 The commission was beset with accommodation woes ever since it was reconstituted in May 2013. In 2014, the commission began to discharge its duties from Raghava Sadan, which was allotted to Khan as official residence, after the government instructed that the panel vacate rooms 320 and 325 from the third floor of the H Block in the Secretariate so as to make way for offices of the state of Andhra Pradesh. This, after the commission petitioned the High Court.
 
 “The commission also functioned from my residence on a temporary basis. The government is yet to pay salaries of staff as well as reimburse other expenses. During the monsoon, the commission could not function for a fortnight as a sewage water had flooded the Raghava Sadan.
 
 It was only after the governor intervened that it was addressed,“ SMC chairman Abid rasool Khan said.
