SHIMLA:   MP of   Anurag Thakur has asked the authorities to complete the detailed survey work of the 50 km broad gauge railway line in   between Una and Hamirpur within six months. He said that the rail connectivity is one of the key agenda on his list as it is an important aspect to boost the economy of the state. He also informed that he had held several meetings with the key stakeholders in the ministry to seek their support in expediting the projects.

 Thakur said, “The rail connectivity will act as a catalyst and would improve trade and business opportunities and also give a boost to the tourism industry. This will help the state to grow.” He further added that once the rail link starts functioning, it will help the locals to commute.
 
 The tender notice for the project has already been issued. 
 
 According to Thakur, the Union government has started the process of geological mapping and final location surveying in six months. He also said that other proposed project includes the Amb-Andaura to Daulatpur Chowk (16 km) rail section. In June 2016, the initial survey for Una–Hamirpur railway link was completed in a record time. In the budget presented on February 1 this year, the construction of this 50 km railway line to be constructed at a cost of Rs 2,850 crore was also approved.
 
 “In a span of six months, the central government has issued a tender for the detailed survey and also gave the estimation of the rail link,” he said.
 
 MP also said that he is making continuous efforts to enhance the connectivity in the state and this can be gauged from the fact that in the union budget 2017-18 close to Rs 400 crore were sanctioned for the railway construction.
