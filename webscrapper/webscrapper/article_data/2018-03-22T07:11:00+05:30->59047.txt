LUDHIANA: Financial commissioner (taxation) M P   and excise and taxation commissioner   in a meeting here on Tuesday decided to organise draw of 670   on March 26 at Harsheela Resorts, Ferozepur Road.

 Unlike last year, when a tender was conducted and only large players were able to participate, a draw will be conducted in which anyone depositing Rs 18,000 as non-refundable ‘parchi’ (Lucky draw slip) will be able to participate. The move has been appreciated by small liquor contractors, who were not able to participate in draw tender last year.
 
 According to deputy excise and taxation commissioner ( ) of  , along with reducing the draw slip to Rs 18,000, the group size has also been reduced to Rs 5 crore so that maximum number of businessmen -- small or large -- can participate.
 
 “There will be a total of 135 total groups of liquor vends in Ludhiana, under which 670 liquor vends will be allotted. We are expecting to collect Rs 827 crore revenue from the liquor draw for 2018-19,” he said. DETC also informed that proper security arrangements have been made by the administration and the draw will be held under the supervision of senior police officials.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Gurcharan Batra a liquor contractor said, “We are happy that this time draw is being conducted instead of a tender. This will give equal chance to all. Last year, due to the tender system we were unable to participate in the draw. There were several conditions which could only be fulfilled by large-scale players”.
