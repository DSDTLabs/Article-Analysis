CHARMINAR: The state government appears to be not so keen to provide the   report on the   police firing. After having declined in November to provide a copy of the report for academic purpose to a Right to Information (RTI) activist, on Tuesday it even skipped a hearing before the   (CIC) on the issue. Five people were killed in police firing on the crowd after the blast in the mosque on May 18, 2007. When the case came up for hearing before chief information commissioner M Ratan on Tuesday , RTI activist SQ Masood was present but there was no official from the general administration department. This despite the commission sending both the parties a notice on January 2, 2016 to appear with documents specifying what kind of action had been taken on the   . With the govern ment not appearing for the hearing, the chief information commissioner said he would soon give his order.

 It was on September 12 that RTI activist Masood had sought information on the terms of reference (ToR) of the panel.“Apart from asking for the ToR, I also asked for a copy. And if this is not possible, I requested for time so that I could read the report, which is permissible under provisions of the RTI Act,“ Masood said. While the query was sent to the chief minister's office, it was then forwarded to the home department and then to general administration (law and order) department.
 
 In November, responding to a query from Masood, the general administration (law and order) department refused to provide a copy of the report on technical grounds. “I am to inform that the information sought has to be placed before both the Houses of state legislature, hence it is not feasible to furnish the same, in terms of the section 8 (1) (c) of the RTI Act, 2005,“ an excerpt from the communication read. The section provides for an exemption from furnishing information on the ground that doing so can cause a “breach of privilege“ of   or state legislature.
