AURANGABAD: The crime branch of the city police, which is probing the rewriting of answer sheets scam, have decided to summon Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University’s (Bamu) Controller of Examinations and   for recording their statements. But the university went a step further and decided to shunt out DM Netke, the Controller of Examinations. He has been replaced by Rajesh Ragde, Director of Student’s Welfare Department. The order to shunt out Netke was given by Vice-Chancellor BA Chopade.

 The crime branch team’s raid at   corporator’s residence in the early hours of Wednesday has blown the lid off a major scam. All the arrested accused, including corporator and his son were remanded to police custody on Thursday till 23 May, 2017.
 
 Sai Institute of Engineering and Technology and its activities were under the scanner for the police for the past couple of years, but failure in initiating timely action let the racket flourish this year as well.
 
 Aurangabad commissioner of police  , said, “Our teams will be summoning university’s joint registrar and examination controller for recording their statements.”
 
 A senior crime branch official told TOI, “If need be, we will summon vice chancellor, because he is morally responsible for everything and anything happening under his nose.”
 
 When asked about parallel action being taken by university against the guilty staffers, Yadav said, “The action being taken by the University is civil in nature and we have initiated a criminal process against them. Both are independent of each other and we will soon arrest some officials from the University for their being hand in gloves.”
 
 The   police crime branch on Wednesday raided the house of Sitaram Sure, a Shiv Sena corporator from Surewadi in the city, and bust the scam. Several students were caught red-handed when they were filling blank answer sheets of a civil engineering exam paper held a day earlier.
