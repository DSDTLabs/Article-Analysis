BENGALURU: San Francisco-based cab-hailing major   launched its food delivery business —   — on Tuesday in India, competing with existing players like   and  . Having launched its operations in select areas of Mumbai, UberEats plans to have the service in the top six cities by year-end.

 Bhavik Rathod, former GM (south & west), Uber India, has been appointed as the head of the UberEATS business here. Globally, UberEATS is available in 78 cities across 26 countries. 
 
 "We have tied up with around 200 restaurants, along with 100 delivery partners to kick off the operations," Rathod said. The company is believed to be charging a higher commission compared with its rivals Zomato and Swiggy. 
 
 Existing players typically charge 15-20% of the order value as their commission. UberEATS will also levy a Rs 15 delivery fee as it does not have any minimum order threshold for users. Rathod did not comment on the commissions it was charging from restaurant partners.
 
 Over the last two years, food technology firms have seen several ups and downs with the likes of TinyOwl shutting shop and many others forced to prune their operations as margins in the business are wafer thin. "The growth trajectory has been positive for us but Uber's planned entry is likely to cause a disruption and could have an impact on other players' market share," a top executive of a leading food technology startup said.
 
 Uber's Indian rival Ola too had started a food delivery service,  , which was shut down last year as the cab aggregator decided to focus on its core business.
