 Ariana Grande has suspended her world tour until June 5 in the wake of the deadly attack at her concert in   that claimed the lives of 22 people, including children. 

 The 23-year-old singer's scheduled concerts in Europe- including two in London's O2 Arena as well as all others until the one planned for June 5 in Switzerland - have been cancelled as Grande wanted to pay "proper respects to those lost".
 
  
  
 "Due to the tragic events in Manchester, the Dangerous Woman tour with   has been suspended until we can further assess the situation and pay our proper respects to those lost," the tour's promoters confirmed in a statement. 
 
 "We ask at this time that we all continue to support the city of Manchester and all those families affected by this cowardice and senseless violence. Our way of life has once again been threatened but we will overcome this together. Thank you." 
 
 Grande, who, hours after the attack, tweeted that she was "broken" and at a loss for words, returned to her home town of Boca Raton in Florida on Tuesday. 
 
  
  
 Her current 'The Dangerous Woman Tour' is in support of her third studio album, 'Dangerous Woman', which released last year on May 20. The tour began on February 3, in Phoenix, Arizona. 
 
 The album is the follow-up to her 2014 studio album 'My Everything' and features guest appearances from Minaj, Lil Wayne,   and Future. The lead single 'Dangerous Woman' was released on March 11, 2016.
