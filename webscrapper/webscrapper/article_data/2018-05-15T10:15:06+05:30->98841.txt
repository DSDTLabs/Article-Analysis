KOLKATA:   has started working on a design to set up a smart digital library in New Town. The library will have e-books, e-subscriptions, Kindle-like e-readers that can be borrowed, audio books, online resources, digital archives, information centres and career guidance corners along with newspapers, magazines and a coffee shop. 

 The authorities recently held a meeting to discuss the project. "Apart from having various kind of books, a good public library also serves as a social meeting point where people can come and chat on different issues over a cup of coffee," an official said. 
 
 According to the plan, the library will have a general section, children's area, teen services, events and workshop corner and a cafeteria. The general section will have open shelves for books and magazines with adequate seating arrangements and a public area with PCs and a printer. The children's section would be a colourful area with books for them.
 
 There will also be a teen services section for organising group study and projects for school students.
 
 Various activities would be organised in the library daily. There will be events for children with workshops, storytelling session and documentary shows. The   plans to to have a weekly 'over-reach service', whereby a mobile van would carry books to senior citizens.
