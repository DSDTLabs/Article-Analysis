Since Mahalaya, the first day of Navratri, an air of celebration and exhilaration has gripped the city. Adding zing to the week-long celebrations are the garba and dandiya nights, that are being organised in the city. Even though the dance forms are immensely popular in   and  ,   also seem to have mastered the moves and make the best of festive times. Soaked in the spirit of   and clad in colourful attires, 
city folks are getting on to the dance floor and grooving to dandiya beats. The inclination is on upswing especially among the youth. The city is bustling with youngsters wielding dandiya sticks and dancing like thereâ€™s no tomorrow.
