Mumbai: Following in the footsteps of market leader   ( ),   (GCPL) has taken price corrections in the range of 6-8% in its toilet soaps portfolio. The price cuts are with the objective of passing on   benefits to consumers.

 A 100gm pack of four Godrej No.1 soaps, which was priced at Rs 72, now has a maximum retail price (MRP) of Rs 66. On Fairglow’s 75gm  , the MRP has come down by Rs 5 to Rs 70. GCPL business head (India and  ) Sunil Kataria said, “After taking a 48-hour IT shutdown to move to the new tax regime, we witnessed a smooth transition to GST.” 
 
 After GST, the tax rate on soaps, hair oils and toothpastes has come down to 18% from the earlier levels of 24-25%. On  , skin care, hair care and biscuits, however, the tax rate has increased to 28% from 24-25%.
 
 In hair colours, where tax rates have increased after GST, Kataria said GCPL is not hiking prices. He said the company does not want to create roadblocks in growth and would like consumer demand to get stimulated. 
 
 “We would like to drive a volume-led growth in hair colours. We are thus not increasing prices in this category,” said Kataria.
 
 To pass on GST benefits, HUL is offering 33% extra volume on select stock keeping units (SKUs) of Pears and 35% extra volume on its premium soap brand Dove. The multinational also took a price reduction on Rin bar and increased the grammage of Surf Excel bar. Emami too dropped the price of ‘Emami 7 Oils in One’ by 6-9% across SKUs for production done under GST regime, while Colgate-Palmolive (India) took price cuts on toothpastes and toothbrushes by 8-9%.
 
 So far, FMCG companies have mostly absorbed cost escalations due to GST, while passing on the benefits to consumers wherever the tax rate has come down.
