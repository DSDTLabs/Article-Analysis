GANDHINAGAR: Demonetisation has punched a hole in the state’s coffers. In an election year, the state’s   reported a fall in value added tax (VAT) revenues, which form the bulk of the state’s income. Of the Rs 50,500 crore estimate, the state fell short by a whopping Rs 6,500 crore (about 13%).

 A key official privy to the development said: “Even with receipt of old dues cleared in old currency notes, total commercial tax (VAT) receipts are likely to be around Rs 44,000 crore (net) according to revised estimates, against budgetary projections of Rs 50,500 crore.”
 
 There is likely to be a substantial reduction in government expenditure too, due to the fall in the state’s revenue as well as the inability of departments to spend. By the end of January, average spending of the state government was only around 60%, even as the new budget is to be tabled on February 21.
 
 Last year, we received large amounts of old dues from two key companies and around Rs 1,500 crore as CST (central sales tax) compensation from the government of India. However, this year we have not got any such dues and only received Rs 143 crore in CST compensation. After  , average collections have witnessed a fall. Even though we hope for good receipts under the settlement schemes, according to the revised budget estimates, there will be a shortfall of around Rs 6,500 crore from the target.” Commercial tax contributes more than 50% of the state’s total revenue receipts. 
 
 A key official privy to the development said: “Though it will take a few more days for the revised revenue estimates of non-commercial tax revenue — like stamp duty and registration fees (target Rs 6,550 crore), land revenue (target Rs 2,665.18 crore), taxes on vehicles (target Rs 3,502 crore), electricity duty (target Rs 6,506 crore) etc — total revenue estimates in the 2016-17 budget was Rs 89,889.88 crore. Now, there may be a shortfall of around Rs 8,000 crore by the end of March 2017.
 
 Though the state’s revenues may see a considerable shortfall, the state government has estimated it will get some Rs 1,000 crore of assistance in addition to the budgetary estimate of Rs 18,520 crore which is the state’s share in central taxes and centrally-sponsored assistance of around Rs 14,048 crore.
