 A few months ago, I met a guy and we grew close over time. I don't know exactly when it turned into a relationship, but before I knew, he kissed me. We had an argument about it and he immediately apologized. I had mentioned it to him that I didn't intend to get sexually involved until our   knew about the relationship and he obliged too. But after few days of completing 7 months, we were at his place and he forced himself on me. It was the first for me since I was a virgin. We used to hang out previously also at his place, but this was the first time he did such a thing. He didn’t even seek my permission. And, all this happened in spite of my decision of not getting physical with him until our families know about our relationship.
 
  He is actually a good guy, but he always hurries up things. I still can't make up my mind on how could someone do such a thing to a person? My instincts suggest that I should be wary of him and end the relationship before it gets too late. But, at the same time, I’ll miss the time spent with him. Please help me figure out what can be the right reaction for this situation. 
 
  
  
 First of all, I am sorry this terrible thing happened to you. Nobody has the right to force himself on to you without your consent, no matter how close the friendship/relationship is. He should have respected your decision. In this case, your instincts seem to be right, so be wary of him.
  
  You can think about a few options on how to react. You can report the matter to the police because   is   and this is illegal. You can also inform him about the same. Try talking about it with your parents (or a confidant) if you are comfortable with the idea.
  
  If the sex was unprotected, do take an emergency contraception and also get tested for STDs/HIV to be on the safer side.
