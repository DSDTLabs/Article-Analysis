PUNE: A 28-year-old   has been   for allegedly sending lewd text messages to a 36-year-old makeup artist on her cellphone on June 15, 2016. 

 The Bibvewadi police said the suspect, originally from Rajasthan but currently staying in Pashan, was working at an aviation firm in Mumbai. “He also used to offer services to a city-based businessman for maintaining his helicopter,” the police said. 
 
 According to the police, the suspect befriended the complainant on a social networking site in 2014 and got her cellphone number. 
 
 “Initially, he would send her usual good morning messages, but the woman ignored them and eventually blocked his number. The suspect then changed his cellphone number and started sending her   on WhatsApp. This prompted the woman to file a complaint with the cybercrime cell of the Pune police,” the police said. 
 
 The suspect would frequently change his cellphone number. 
 
 “Since he was changing his cellphone number every now and then, the police had a tough time tracing him,” a police said.
 
 Inspector Santosh Barge said of the Bibvewadi police said on Saturday, “The suspect evaded arrest by changing cell numbers and stealing phone of a man in Baramati for sending lewd messages to the woman.”
 
 It was after  , that we could trace and arrest him, the officer said, adding that further investigations are on.
