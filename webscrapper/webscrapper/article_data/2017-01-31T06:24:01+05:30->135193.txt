PUNE: Moving away from the current three times a week treatment, over 1.30 lakh   ( )   in the state will switch over to   from next month.

 Maharashtra was one of the five states, including Bihar, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim, to roll out daily drug treatment for TB in India a month ago. However, it was initially meant only for patients with TB-HIV co-infection.
 
 The switch over follows findings by experts who revealed that the old regimen led to increased cases of drug resistance and relapse among TB patients. Relapse occurs when a patient declared ‘cured’ by a doctor tests positive for the same disease again.
 
 “We started daily drug regimen for TB-HIV co-infected patients in Maharashtra from December 1, 2016. Now the Union government has extended the daily treatment to every TB patient under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) in five states, including Maharashtra. We intend to start this regimen for every TB patients in the state from February 10,” state tuberculosis officer Sanjeev Kamble said.
 
 The drug will be given free to all patients at state-run health care facilities and designated civic-run TB care centres. Besides, every newly diagnosed TB patient in the state will also get the daily drug treatment.
 
 Sunil Khaparde, deputy director general (TB control), Union health ministry, said, “The daily drug regimen has drastically raised the need for TB drugs. We have already provided the drugs to the five states as per their requirement. Now it’s their call to roll out the new drug regimen.”
 
 “Daily treatment can have equally high compliance rates with the added benefit of less harm that may accrue out of a single missed dose, compared with the thrice weekly regimen,” Sharad Agarkhedkar, senior paediatrician and former vice-president of the state chapter of Indian Medical Association, said.
