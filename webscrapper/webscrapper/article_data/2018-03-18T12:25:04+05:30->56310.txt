BAREILLY: In a stern move, the   ( ) will now be giving only two-day time to bill defaulters having small pending amount to clear their dues. The process of disconnection, however, will be initiated on the spot for those having arrears of over Rs 50,000. Earlier, such defaulters were given 15-30 days to clear their dues.

 Officials at power department told TOI that the decision to this effect was taken at a recent meeting held in Bareilly which was headed by   ( ) managing director AP Singh.
 
 Speaking with TOI, UPPCL executive engineer PA Moga said, “It is necessary to recover revenues as there are several defaulters who are not used to paying their bills timely. Since power consumers do not make regular payments, there is a risk that the department might face loss of revenue. To tackle the situation, it has now been decided that the power consumers who have pending electricity bills of over Rs 50,000 will lose connections immediately. After this, the process of issuing recovery certificate and property attachment will be initiated.”
 
 Moga added, “Earlier, the department had its main focus only on big defaulters and they were granted ample time to clear their dues. However, it has been observed that people had made it a habit of not clearing their outstanding bills within the given period too. A few consumers even failed to pay their bills even in installments. For consumers having small dues, they can contact the official concerned to know whether they are allowed for part payment.”
 
 The MVVNL MD, AP Singh, had also conducted a surprise inspection of the powerhouses located in   and Delapir areas of the city to take stock of the situation there. The inspection was carried out in the presence of executive engineers, chief engineers and assistant engineers along with other departmental staff of the entire Bareilly division.
