MUMBAI: Five years after the Bombay   allowed her to attend a masters course in design at IIT-B, a student with learning disability finds herself without a final degree, despite completing all semesters. The HC said the girl’s condition, dyscalculia, cannot be taken to be a physical disability.

 
 However, given the fact that she successfully completed the course in 2015, the question before the HC was, to do complete justice whether it could direct the   to award her the degree. The HC this week said its powers were limited and hence it cannot direct the IIT to grant her a degree. HCs, unlike SCs, lack powers to pass orders to do complete justice, said a bench of Justices M S   and   while disposing the student’s petition. She would need to move the SC now.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 The student had secured a bachelor of design degree from   and gave the Common Entrance Exam for Design (CEED) under general category. After she could not qualify for the master of design course at IIT-B, she sought to be allowed admission under the physical disability category. IIT-B refused and said she had applied under the general category. She moved the HC in 2013. In September 2013, the HC, in interest of justice, permitted her to attend classes without prejudice to her as well as IIT-B’s rights.
 
 The HC said, “We are of the view that although the petitioner may be entitled to be declared successful in the course, we are unable to grant her any further relief in this petition.”
 
 Significantly, the IIT lawyer said that ‘physical disability’ in its forms is not restricted to persons with physical disability.
 
 The HC said, “In our view to make special provision for the integration of persons with disabilities into the social mainstream would be one of the heads under which an educational institute could provide for learning disability.”
