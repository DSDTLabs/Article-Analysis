JAIPUR: Proposal to construct five foot overbridges (FoBs) on Bus Rapid Transit Corridor (BRTS)   has hit the roadblock. 

  (JDA)’s finance wing has raised an objection on the proposal. As pedestrians are finding it difficult to cross road due to erected railings, proposal was forwarded to construct three FoBs at major points on   and two on  . 
 
 Engineering wing proposed to construct FoBs on built operate and transfer (BoT) basis. However, objection was raised by finance wing. “We have asked to invite private players for construction. The awarded firm could earn revenue after selling the advertisement space. But project was rejected,” said a JDA engineer. 
 
 Sources said finance department also claimed that there are no accidents reported so far on the route and it would not help pedestrians. 
 
 An official said, “Large number of city’s population travels to Ajmer Road and Mansarovar as these areas have become a hub for education and business. This is the reason JDA constructed BRTS on this route. FoB is must as it’s unsafe for pedestrians to cross roads on the busy route.” 
 
 “Similarly, the seven kms corridor constructed on Sikar Road has increased the travel speed of vehicles. Also, many institutes and hospitals fall along BRTS. FoB will be required sooner or late,” he added
 
 It was informed that many points at crossroads falling on BRTS corridor are unsafe. However, not many efforts have been made in this regard. “JDA has failed to change design of 12 crossroads falling on BRTS corridor on Ajmer Road. In December 2015, decision was taken after security audit was conducted by the   (CRRI). JDA had spent Rs 10 lakh for conducting security audit. But no changes have been made till date,” said the official.
