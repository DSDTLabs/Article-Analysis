Ludhiana: A few days after the BJP finished its application seeking process from ticket aspirants for the MC elections, the Congress has now swung into action and preponed the application process.

 Though it had planned to start the process on January 15, the party will now issue the application forms from Thursday (January 11) while January 18 has been kept as the last date of issuing forms and withdrawal as well. The fee for form for general category has been kept at Rs 1,000 while it is Rs 500 for reserved category.
 
 Party sources said the date has been preponed keeping in view the growing restlessness among the tickets aspirants who feel that if the party delays the process any further, then it can harm their winning prospects as they will get very less time for campaigning.
 
 Gurpreet Gogi, president of District Congress Committee (DCC), said, “We are starting the application process from January 11. Interested candidates can get the form from the DCC office at Chaura Bazar from 10am tomorrow and it can be submitted till January 18. Names can also be withdrawn till January 18.”
 
 Gogi said, “Unlike our rivals, we have kept very nominal fees for the application forms, which is Rs 1000 for general and Rs 500 for reserved category applicants.”
 
 Talking about the issue of multiple aspirants seeking tickets from each ward, Gogi said, “This is not a serious issue and our party high command is capable enough of resolving it. The tickets will be distributed only after taking in consideration the norms decided by our senior party leaders.”
