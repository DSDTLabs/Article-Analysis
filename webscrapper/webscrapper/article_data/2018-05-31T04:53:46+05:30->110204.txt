MUMBAI:   has clocked a passenger growth of almost 1 lakh per day in this financial year due to increase in number of services, extension of harbour line services up to   and also better performance in the ticket-checking drive.

 Central Railway carries 42.4 lakh passengers every day on its suburban network that includes the main line, harbour line and also trans-harbour line (Thane-Panvel).
 
 A CR official said, “Since April 1, we have added 62 lakh more passengers over a period of two months. It means that on an average, we are witnessing a growth of 1 lakh passenger per day.”
 
 The earnings too have increased as the CR has earned Rs23.12 crore between April and May 2018 as compared to Rs 22.5 crore in the corresponding period last year.
 
 An official said, “It does appear that the number of passengers has increased because of the extension of harbour line services to Goregaon.”
 
 Harbour line services were extended up to Goregaon from March 29. A total of 49 services operated between these two destinations every day.
 
 Moreover, in fact, in 2016-17, all the 9-car services on harbour were converted to 12-car, thus increasing the carrying capacity by 33 per cent.
 
 A CR official said, “People in   and Masjid use to travel to Churchgate to board the train for Goregaon. Now, the passengers can get a direct train from CSMT, which may have made a huge difference.”
 
 Another reason for improvement is the improved ticket-checking performance A total of 3.11 lakh without ticket passengers as compared to 2.98 lakh passengers in the same period last year. This is an increase of almost 13,000.”
