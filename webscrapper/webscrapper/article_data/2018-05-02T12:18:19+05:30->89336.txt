 HYDERABAD:Muslims in Hyderabad observed  , which falls between the 14th and 15th of Sha’aban (8th Islamic month) on Tuesday.   seek forgiveness and mercy for themselves and for the deceased from God on the night of May 1 and May 2, with houses, streets and graveyards lit up with candles and lights.
 
 Sunni Muslims comprise the majority of Islam and believe in the four Caliphs as their leaders. They pray, fast and shop on this auspicious day.
 
 “We pray the whole night. Allah writes about our rewards, keeps in mind our sins and grants us our destiny and lifeline. It’s like starting anew. We think of where we need to stop wasting money, shop for our family’s needs and buy food, so we have enough for the entire year”, said Mariam Hameed, a devotee.
 
 The devout believe there is a special tree in heaven with people’s names on its leaves. “If the leaf with our name on it falls tonight then we could die this year,” said one devotee Shia Muslims who comprise the second largest branch of Islam believe in the 12 Imams as their leaders (descendants of the Prophet). On 15th of Sha’aban, they also celebrate the birthday of their 12th Imam.
 
 Masuma Ali Dubey, director of Nature’s Nest resort, said, “We visit the Imam-e-Zamin mountain in Khayam Nagar and distribute sweets. Then we visit graveyards across Old City, including Mir Momin Dayra, to pray for the peace and forgiveness of our deceased relatives. The souls of those dead visit us today.”
 
 They pray the whole night for a long life, fortune and seek forgiveness.
 
 “We cook mutton khorma, roti and kheer, burn candles and conduct Jashans (parties) for the 12th Imam’s long life. Then we feed the poor,” added Azra Hasan, an architect.
