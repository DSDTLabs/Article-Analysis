LUCKNOW: Agitated over Adityanath Yogi government’s decision to scrap projects and schemes launched by the Akhilesh Yadav government, the   is all set to register a strong protest during the budget session of the state assembly beginning on Tuesday. The ruling BJP has upset the   with its decision to demolish the cycle tracks and to scrap the previous government’s pension scheme.

 SP leaders said issues like rising crime in the state and attacks on women will also be taken up. “They (BJP) had promised a crime-free UP but two top medical practitioners from chief minister’s hometown Gorakhpur have received extortion calls from criminals lodged in jails over the last 15 days,” said a former minister and sitting SP MLA claiming that such incidents prove the government has failed to contain the rising crime graph.
 
 The party is also irked over the state government’s decision to demolish cycle tracks that were laid during the SP regime across the state. SP national president Akhilesh Yadav had taken the state government head-on claiming that such moves were politically motivated and against public interest. He had issued a statement claiming that cycle tracks were laid to encourage people who use the pollution-free mode of commuting.
 
 “As a responsible opposition, we are bound to take up issues in public interest and will do so in a democratic manner on the floor of the house,” said SP chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary. He said deteriorating   will be the main issue. The maiden session of the UP assembly held in May had witnessed major protests by opposition parties on the same issue and paper balls were hurled at Governor   during his address.
