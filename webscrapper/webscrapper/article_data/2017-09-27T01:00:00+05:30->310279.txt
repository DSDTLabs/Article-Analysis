 was overjoyed to meet football icons   and   at an event in Mumbai recently. The Swedish beauty was delighted to click pictures with the Soccer stars and share the experience with her friends back home. 

 She told BT, “I was on cloud nine, I was jumping around like a kid after meeting them. I told Ronaldinho that I am a huge fan and asked him if I could click a picture with him, hug him and get his autograph. He was kind enough to oblige.” 
 
 The actress, who also performed at the event, added, “I couldn’t have imagined a moment like this even in my wildest dreams. I am a big fan of football and so are my friends back home in Sweden, where the game is hugely popular.” The icing on the cake was Ronaldinho sharing a video of the event on his photo-sharing page, which also featured Elli. “I am lucky”, she said with a broad smile.
