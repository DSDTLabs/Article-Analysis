LUCKNOW To commemorate the 138th death anniversary of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah’s first wife   on Friday, Muslims organised ‘Fatiha’ (ritual prayer for the dead) in their homes but in the wake of the ongoing meat sellers’ strike, they had to do without the culinary   that were her favourite. Several families said it is the first time in decades they are facing a problem in following their years’ old rituals.

 According to historian Roshan Taqui, Hazrat Mahal was married with Nawab Wajid Ali Shah in 1842, after the latter saw her helping her father in preparing a plan for the Nawab’s empire. The title ‘Hazrat Mahal’ was given to her by the Nawab after he married her and discovered her culinary talents. 
 
 Hazrat Mahal famous for the dishes she prepared with   and   for the Nawab. She was also known for the invention of dishes like kofte, stew and makhani gosht. She asked the ancestors of Tundey Kababi to create a non-vegetarian recipe for the Nawab when he was suffering from toothache. The kabab dish was invented then. For the feast after Fatiha on the her anniversary, it is a ritual to prepare a variety of buffalo meat and mutton delicacies. Families in Old City who organised the ritual prayer said the closure of meat shops hit their feast. “We have never faced such circumstances as we are facing now,” said Sameer Abbas. 
 
 “We have prepared vegetable dishes which were never quite appreciated by Hazrat Mahal and it is a matter of shame for us”, said Razi Hasan.
