KOLKATA: The   (NKDA) has decided to spray Bacillus Thuringiensis Israelensis (BTI) , a kind of bacteria that destroys mosquito larvae, to prevent dengue outbreak in the township.   officials said that   will be sprayed using a hand compression machine having a tank capacity of 10 litre or more. 

 An agency is being selected for the work. It was four years back when the idea to use BTI as a mosquito killing agent was proposed by Gautam Chandra, a zoology professor of  . A report submitted by   and his team had mentioned, “spraying mosquito larvaecidal agents like BTI, a kind of naturally occurring bacteria that infects and kill mosquito larvae, is an effective solution. 
 
 
  
 These bacteria are highly selective, killing only mosquitoes, fungus gnats and blackflies. Formulations of BTI will only kill these types of insects and won’t harm other insects, fish, birds, worms or any mammals.” “Temephos and BTI should be sprayed for two months each to get the maximum effect,” Chandra said. He went to   about 10 days back to have a look on the present situation. Other than using BTI, the NKDA authorities will also spray temephos and citronella chemicals. 
 
 Officials said that fogging will be continued using only 2% extract of pyrethrins. Also, house-to-house survey will be conducted across New Town as a part of its vector-control measures.
