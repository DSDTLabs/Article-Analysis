 MUMBAI: The   water supply department plugged the leakage spots on the main supply line near steel market in   after a TOI report (May 28). 

 MIDC sources said the truck drivers frequenting Mumbai wholesale steel market are tampering with the main supply lines and repeated attempts to plug the leakage have been short-lived. 
 
  Miscreants had tampered with the pipeline from   river that supplies to PCMC areas and industrial units near Kalamboli wholesale steel market. MIDC deputy engineer, CN   said, "We enforced temporary shutdown to get the spots fixed and informed the market committee to get a legal connection for the truck operators. The broken valves have been fixed."
