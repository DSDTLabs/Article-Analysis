LUDHIANA: A class IV employee of a private school allegedly sexually assaulted a four-year-old boy of nursery class. The accused used to “make the child watch blue films on his phone before assaulting him inside the school washroom”.

 The parents came to know of the incident on Wednesday when the boy complained of severe pain in his private parts. The parents reached the school on Thursday, where the boy identified the accused and the police took him into custody.
 
 Father of the boy alleged that his son told them that an uncle in the school assaulted him inside the washroom. He said the boy told that the man used to make him watch blue films on his phone and touch him inappropriately. “My son was in pain for the past so many days, but we ignored it. He was scared to tell anything, but my wife and I managed to draw truth from him. When we send our kids to school, we trust the authorities to ensure their safety. But kids are not safe in school. My son is scared now,” he added.
 
  inspector Brij Mohan said, “The police have recovered the  . We are scanning the footage of CCTV cameras installed in the school, especially around the washrooms. Even as a complaint has been lodged, the case will be thoroughly investigated before registering an FIR.”
 
 The school owner said, “The accused is a gatekeeper and never enters the school. As it is a playway school, we only have women staff. The women employees take kids to washroom. In view of the serious allegations, we are fully cooperating with the police and the parents.”
 
 The school authorities, meanwhile, have filed a complaint against the boy’s parents and those who accompanied them to the school, accusing them of misbehaving with teachers.
 
 “The school authorities alleged that the boy’s parents, along with outsiders, barged into the school and misbehaved with teachers rather than taking up the matter peacefully,” the SHO added.
