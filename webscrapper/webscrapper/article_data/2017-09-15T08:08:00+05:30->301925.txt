Ludhiana: A day after Lok Insaf Party MLA Simarjit Singh Bains caught a government official taking a bribe, Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu warned government officials against indulging in the malpractice. Releasing a press statement, Bittu asked corrupt officials to stop exploiting people or face consequences. “It was common to see a few officials, especially those in the revenue department, appointing illegal agents exploiting people. I have taken up the issue with DC Pardeep Kumar Agrawal and these officials and agents carrying on such activities in government offices will be identified. These agents are looting people and damaging the image of the state government, which will not be tolerated.” 

 Bittu said police have been asked to take stern action against unscrupolous agents and officials, who will be dismissed from service.
