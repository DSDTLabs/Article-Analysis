AHMEDABAD: Even as the smoke over firing on Borsad councillor   is yet to fade out, two more city-based builders have alleged that they have received extortion threats from  , the underworld don who was once a right hand of  . 

 The cops claim that sharp shooter Suresh Pillai of Thane, who had fired three rounds at the councillor, was in touch with Pujari in October, 2016.
 
 According to the top city police officials, out of the six extortion complaints probed by the city crime branch, two have recently been registered.
 
 “Pujari told the builder that he had kept his son’s movements under observation and threatened him with dire consequences if he did not take him seriously,” said a senior police official.
 
 Gujarat ATS on Tuesday arrested three persons including Pillai for a murder attempt on Borsad councillor Pragnesh Patel. The incident had taken place on January 13.
 
 The officials said a builder and a mall owner in Surat was also in the hit list of Pujari. “The builder had refused to pay extortion money to Pujari. Pujari then sent Pillai to Surat and kept him in a rented house there to track the builder and plan an attack on him. Even the rent of the house where Pillai stayed was paid by Pujari through angadia,” said the official. The officials probing the extortion complaints lodged against Pujari are finding the tracking of the calls time consuming. “The calls have been made through Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and hence tracking them is a time consuming job,” said an official. 
 
 The officials said that Pujari is also a member of a drug syndicate run by international drug mafia  , who is originally from Ahmedabad and is currently based in Kenya.
 
 “It was Goswami who was providing cell numbers of city-based builders to Pujari who used to make extortion calls to them. Goswami has contacts in the city and we are tracing them,” added the official.
