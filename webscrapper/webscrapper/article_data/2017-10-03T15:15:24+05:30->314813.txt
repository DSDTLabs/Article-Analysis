PATNA: JD(U) national general secretary and   member R C P Singh on Monday said the national council meet called by rebel party senior   at Delhi on October 8 was “illegal” as the Election Commission (EC) had dismissed his claims. Singh also asked   to quit as Rajya Sabha member.

 Sharad on Sunday said the EC, in a letter on September 27, had written to him that “it would be open to you to file a fresh application along with the documentary evidence in support of the claim that may be made in such application”.
 
 Singh said the fact is that Sharad has submitted documents to the EC not twice, but thrice and every time they have been found to be far short of sufficient evidence to back up his claim to the party’s symbol. He said in such a situation, Sharad’s call to hold the party’s national council meet was illegal. 
 
 Sharad fell out with Nitish after the   chief minister walked out of the grand alliance with   and RJD and formed government with the   and other   partners in July this year. Nitish, who is also the JD(U) national president, has already stripped Sharad of the parliamentary party leadership post and replaced him by Singh.
 
 “In the light of the EC asking Sharad to produce evidence, it is clear that he does not have sufficient papers to support his claim. He, in that circumstances, should quit his Rajya Sabha membership,” Singh said.
