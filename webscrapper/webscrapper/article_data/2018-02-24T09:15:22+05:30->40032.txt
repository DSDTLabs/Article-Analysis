AMRITSAR: International luxury fashion brand   has come under attack from Sikhs around the world for launching its Fall 2018 collection with models sashaying in Sikh-styled turbans as headgears during the Milan Fashion Week.

 Gucci’s cudgel with   has not only invited wrath of many models and actors but also Sikhs for bringing ‘disgrace’ to one of their religious symbols.
 
 Following the release of pictures of models wearing Sikh turbans on the internet, social media users blasted Gucci for ‘insulting’ Sikhs by using one of their five—articles of faith—and using it as hats.
 
 Many Sikh individuals and actors have tweeted against Gucci’s for being ‘offensive and irresponsible.’
 
 Manjit Singh, a Sikh entrepreneur from London, told TOI, “For Sikhs, turban is not a fashion accessory but an integral part of our religion. Presenting it like that is profane.”
 
 Harjinder Singh Kukreja tweeted, “Dear@gucci, the Sikh turban is not a hot new accessory for white models but an article of faith for practising Sikhs. Your models have used turbans as ‘hats’ whereas practising Sikhs tie them neatly fold by fold. Using Sikh turban is worse than selling fake Gucci products.”
 
 According to media reports, Gucci’s creative director Alessandro Michele, who had displayed his creation, had said ahead of the fashion show, “Our job (as creatives) is a surgical job—cutting and assembling and experimenting on the operating table.”
 
 Meanwhile, when contacted,   jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh said the honour of Sikhs’ turban should always be maintained and no one should be allowed to bring disgrace to their article of faith.
