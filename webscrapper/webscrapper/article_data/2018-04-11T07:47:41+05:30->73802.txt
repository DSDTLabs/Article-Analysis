CHENNAI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) moved the Madras high court on Tuesday to vacate an interim stay on its summons issued to  , senior advocate and wife of former Union finance minister P Chidambaram, in connection with the   chit funds case.

 When the plea came up for hearing, Justice S M Subramaniam adjourned the hearing to April 13. On September 7, 2016, ED issued summons to the petitioner over her receipt of over Rs1crore as fee from promoters of Sarada group.

 On September 21, 2016, a single judge of the court admitted the pleas and granted interim relief by directing the ED to keep the summons in abeyance till further orders.
