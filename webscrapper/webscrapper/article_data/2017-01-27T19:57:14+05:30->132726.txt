LONDON: In a major gaffe, the   misspelled British Prime Minister  's name three times in an official schedule of her visit to the US, confusing her name with a porn star.

 Staff in US President  's administration missed out the 'h' in her name in a document setting out the plan for talks on Friday, including a "bilateral meeting" in the   and a "working luncheon" following a joint press conference.
 
 The White House's daily guidance and press schedule from the office of the press secretary reads: "In the afternoon, the president will partake in a bilateral meeting with United Kingdom Prime Minister,  " - missing out the "h" in her name, despite spelling it correctly elsewhere, the Mirror reported.
 
 It continued: "The president participates in a working luncheon with Teresa May, Prime Minister of United Kingdom."
 
 The error was repeated in a later guidance note from the Office of the Vice President, though it elsewhere also spelt her name correctly, before finally being rectified fully in another notice from the same office.
 
 Teresa May is the name of a former glamour model and soft porn actress who starred in a video in 1997 for the song Smack My B**** Up, by music band  . 
 
 Teresa May - the actress - also trended on Twitter during the race to be prime minister last summer.
