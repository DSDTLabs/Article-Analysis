KARWAR: A 30-year-old labourer sustained serious injuries after being   while bathing in   on Wednesday. 

 Thakku Gangu Bajari’s house is situated on the banks of Kali river at Sakali in   near Dandeli. Like every day, he went to the river to bathe, but as soon as he stepped into the waters, a crocodile caught him by his leg and dragged him into the water. Local residents rushed to his help and rescued him. Thakku’s right leg has been severely injured. He is under treatment at a hospital in Hubballi.
 
 Thakku’s family members and villagers demanded that the forest department provide him compensation as he was the lone breadwinner of the family and the incident has rendered him physically handicapped. The villagers pooled in a small amount and gave it to his family for the treatment.
