LUCKNOW: The Yogi government is ready to roll out the second phase of its public outreach programme from June 1. Under the 15-day schedule, the government will cover 13,500 villages across the state to promote various Central and state schemes. 

 This time, however, it will not be compulsory for MLAs and ministers to spend nights in villages.
 
 In the first phase of Gram   - now renamed Gram Chaupal Abhiyan - CM   had made it compulsory for public representatives, district magistrates and senior officials to stay overnight in villages and interact with locals. 
 
 "When a minister or   goes to a village, there is a large entourage along. Very often it is not possible to accommodate so many people for night and arrange food for them. This time, therefore, it is not compulsory to spend the night in villages. But, if someone wants to, they can stay over," said party sources.
 
 Officials said that besides villages, slums in city wards would also be covered this time. "The focus is primarily on places which are lagging severely in development. The previous exercise had a focus on Dalits. This time, the focus will be on lack of development. The administration will make a list of eligible persons for various government schemes and ensure that they are enrolled for them," said an official.BJP will also be playing a huge role in the programme. Sources in the party said that about 3,000-odd workers would be mobilized and each will be given around four villages to work on. 
 
 "We are holding regular meetings to chalk out programmes for each village and allocating work to party cadre. The party will make MLAs and ministers responsible for specific areas which they will be required to visit. Before a nigh chaupal is held in a village, party workers will go there and publicise the meeting so that there is a good audience," said party sources.
