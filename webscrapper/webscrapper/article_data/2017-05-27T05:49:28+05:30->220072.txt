BENGALURU: Chief minister   on Friday claimed BJP state president   was practising untouchability by eating food brought from outside at a dalit’s home, despite home-cooked food readily available.

 Speaking to the media here on completion of three years of the   government, Siddaramaiah said Yeddyurappa’s act was evidence enough to prove BJP’s double standards. "Why did he eat outside food when the dalit family had prepared pulao at home? Is it not practising untouchability," he asked.
 
 The chief minister said all these days Yeddyurappa hadn’t visited a dalit’s home. "Now, with elections around the corner, he decided to go to a dalit’s home and fake concern towards the downtrodden community," he added.
 
 
 
 
 BJP chief B S Yeddyurappa’s visit to dalit colonies looks more like a sojourn and a political gimmick. The 12th century social reformer Basavanna promoted inter-caste marriages, which were held at Anubhava Mantapa; he tried to eliminate caste system. If BJP is serious, let it take up inter-caste marriages instead of inter-dining programmes

 Chief minister Siddaramaiah on Friday made a gaffe when he uttered the name of party MP M Veerappa Moily, instead of PM Narendra Modi who was being targeted by the  .
 
 “Moily is full of lies... I am sorry, I always get confused with the names of Moily and Modi,” Siddaramaiah said, which had presspersons and Congress leaders in splits. However, a visibly annoyed CM said: “Why are you laughing so much? I meant the PM and nobody else.”
