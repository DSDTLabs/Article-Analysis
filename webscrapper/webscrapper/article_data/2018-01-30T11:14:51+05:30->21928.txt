HAVERI: The   condemned the delay in disbursal of crop insurance and fulfilment of demands and flung cow dung and tomatoes at district-level officials here on Monday.

 Hundreds of BJP workers, led by district unit president Shivaraj Sajjanar, reached the deputy commissioner’s office by 12.30pm along with cattle and blocked entry to the premises.
 
 Sajjanar said his party has been appealing to the district administration to transfer the compensation amount to beneficiaries’ accounts, under the crop insurance scheme.
 
 “The administration has not met our demands. It has not set up a maize and groundnut procurement centre to purchase the crop from farmers. The state government led by chief minister   and the district administration have neglected farmers for four and a half years,” he said.
 
 The protest turned violent when BJP activists and the cattle headed to the DC’s office. When police officers, including SP K Parashuram and Additional SP   tried to prevent them by setting up barricades, protesters hurled tomatoes and cow dung at them.
 
 BJP workers insisted on submitting their memorandum to the DC.   MLA   sustained minor injuries in the melee.
 
 Police arrested the activists as a precautionary measure to maintain law and order. Police sources said that protesters were taken to the police station and were released later.
