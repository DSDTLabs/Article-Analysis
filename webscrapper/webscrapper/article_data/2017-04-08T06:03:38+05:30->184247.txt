NAGPUR: Refusing to grant any leniency to controversial lawyer Satish Uke, the Nagpur bench of   on Friday imposed another Rs 10,000 cost on him for failing to appear in the proceedings.

 A specially constituted division bench comprising justices Prasanna Varale and   also rejected two applications filed by him. The lawyer had demanded copies of video recordings of contempt proceedings against him in the first suo motu contempt and withdrawal of two-month jail term awarded to him by the court.
 
 Incidentally, it was also the first case in Nagpur bench’s history which was video recorded and first one where a lawyer was convicted for contempt of court.
 
 The bench directed the registry to complete formalities of its earlier orders against Uke at the earliest.
 
 In another suo motu contempt case, the division bench led by justice Bhushan Gavai had issued bailable warrant against him for failure to appear before the court. The commissioner of police was told to trace him and produce him before the court by April 26.
 
 On account of his tendency to evade proceedings, the court already slapped Rs 4.12 lakh charges on him, which he has failed to deposit so far. His Rs2 lakh deposit was already forfeited by the court towards the cost of video recordings.
 
 The first suo motu contempt against the lawyer was initiated by justice   on June 7 last year, stating that there was definite, deliberate, motivated and calculated attempt on Uke’s part to bring down judiciary’s image and obstruct justice administration system.
 
 Justice Deshpande had restrained the court registry, judges and other officers, including lawyers, from entertaining any plea filed by Uke without its permission, while deciding a civil revision application filed by the lawyer himself.
