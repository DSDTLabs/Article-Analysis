AHMEDABAD: Some 7,000 public sector bank employees from across   have been transferred, following an advisory issued by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) to transfer staff in the wake of the fraud at   (PNB). 

 Last week, the CVC had advised banks to transfer officers who have completed three years of service in a branch and clerical staff who have completed five years, as on December 31, 2017.
 
 “The CVC advisory was issued soon after the PNB fraud unfolded,” said  , general secretary, Maha Gujarat Bank Employees Association (MGBEA). Well-placed sources in PNB revealed that some 100 employees from branches across Gujarat have been transferred. Sources in Dena Bank and Bank of Baroda (BoB) also confirmed transfers of employees.
 
 “Nearly 40 people in Oriental Bank of Commerce branches across Gujarat got transfer letters,” said  , general secretary, Oriental Bank of Commerce Employees Union. 
 
 “Most employees received the letter on February 21 and were asked to report for the new assignment the next day. Employees were taken aback by the last-minute notification.” 
 
 He said employees in certain parts of the state were transferred out of their centre, and sent to locations 40-100km from their current location. “Relocating at such a short notice is difficult,” he said.
 
 Transfers have not been effected at some banks, considering the looming end of the financial year. 
 
 “Employees at our bank will get transfer orders in April and May, soon after the financial year-ending procedures are over,” said Anil Dubey, president, Bank Employees Union, Bank of India–South Gujarat. 
 
 All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) also raised concerns over transfers made about a month ahead of the end of the financial year. 
 
 “Banks must adhere to the rules of transfer. They must initiate transfer of employees as per the norms and must not delay it beyond the subsequent quarter,” said J B Patel, president,   (AIBOA)– Gujarat.
