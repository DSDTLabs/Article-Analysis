NEW DELHI: The latest attempt by Aam Aadmi Party to boost donations has come in the form of a letter by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia sent to supporters and regular donors by the party’s outreach team.

 Written in first person, Sisodia has explained the reasons for bringing out the outcome report on the LG’s office and tried to project it as an attempt to “lay new standards in governance.”
 
 “Yesterday, I presented the   outcome report in Delhi assembly, a first such report to hold the institution of LG accountable to the people of Delhi. In the past three years, our government has voiced its frustration over the obstructionist conduct of the office of the LG. The report examines the key policy proposals and schemes of Delhi government that were sent to the LG and provides a detailed analysis of repeated attempts to scuttle our flagship schemes,” Sisodia said in the letter.
 
 The deputy CM asserted, “Even though the LG is appointed by the central government, his decisions have an impact on how public money is spent and how policies are made. It is therefore important that the institution of LG should be accountable to the people of Delhi.”
 
 Sisodia went on to claim that he is aware that the AAP government has the full support of people in laying new standards of accountability in governance. “But we also need your support to make this movement stronger and prepare us for all the challenges that lie ahead,” he concluded. At the end of the letter, there is an icon that people can click to make donations.
