 ’ starring   in a dual avatar who will be seen romancing   and   releases today amidst much fan-fare. 

 
 
 
 Right from the day the film was announced and the first look of Nani released on his birthday on February 24, movie lovers seem to have been taken with the concept of the film. And then, when the songs composed by Hiphop Tamizha released, the soundtrack also garnered praise, especially the massy ‘Dhaari Choodu’. 
 
 
 
 Directed by  , ‘Krishnarjuna Yuddham’ charts the journey of desi lungi-clad Krishna from Chittoor and his leather jacket sporting rockstar lookalike Arjun from Prague. Despite being worlds apart, literally, the two join hands to fight for their love. Anupama Parameswaran and newcomer Rukshar play the love interests of Krishna and Arjun in the film. 
 
 The title of the film was announced by Nani right when he had announced the title of his former film ‘MCA’ (Middle Class Abbayi). While ‘MCA’ starring Nani,   and Bhumika in lead roles had received mixed reviews from both critics and audience alike, expectations lie high on this one. 
 
 
 
 Especially so because Nani, when talking to Hyderabad Times had claimed that it was Gandhi’s narration and treatment that drew him to the film. He had said, “I have known Gandhi since long as he would call me after catching every film of mine on the first day. Wanting to work with each other, I had heard a narration of his for a different story, but I couldn’t see myself doing that film. So two months later, he turned up again with this story and the way he narrated it, I could immediately see myself being a part of the film. I absolutely loved not just the way he narrated it, but the treatment and screenplay he gave for the film too. I immediately okayed it.”
