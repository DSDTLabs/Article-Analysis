MUMBAI:  , late CBI Judge  's son at a press conference on Sunday stated clearly that he had no suspicions about his father's death on December 1, 2014.

 
 At his first media conference soon after four senior most Supreme Court judges held a press conference themselves on the manner of assigning of matters by Chief Justice Of India--where a PIL on Loya's death is also filed--Anuj a 21-year-old law student, said, "I have been going through media reports. I want to make it clear that my family is pained. We have no allegations against anyone. Don't try to harass us or trouble us."
 
 His sudden death as the only bread earner put us into an emotional trauma initially, he said later.
 
 "I was only 17 then and emotionally it affected me," when asked why and if he had changed his stance since the time his father died. He had reportedly questioned the death.
 
 K B Katke, former district judge and a friend of the family said, "because of media reports MLAs and NGOs trying to harass family members. His mother is ill and needs medical treatment."
 
 Anuj Loya, when asked by the media who is was harassing the family, said, "I don't want to name anyone."
 
 Katke added, "Request all media to ask NGOs to stay away from the family. Doubts were created by some, but now it is clear that Loya died because of a heart attack. Good treatment was provided to him. However, he could not survive. And, the family has accepted it."
 
 "This is a matter of great grief for the family. What has happened is tragic. Anuj is very disturbed by all this. We want this issue to remain non-controversial," said advocate   in whose office the PC was held.
