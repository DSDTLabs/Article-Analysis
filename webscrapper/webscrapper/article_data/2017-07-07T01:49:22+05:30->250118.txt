MUMBAI: Wednesday’s visit to   by the parliamentary standing committee proved to be headache for commuters as ticket-checkers (TCs) were out in full force. 

 Nearly Rs 1.25 lakh was netted in fines from those travelling without tickets on Wednesday.
 
 The standing committee was visiting CSMT to inspect the star chambers where the booking offices are located, platforms and the control room.
 
 A senior   official said, “We had deployed about 50 TCs at various locations between 10am and 6pm. This is the practice when important dignitaries, including the parliamentary committee or the railway minister, visit CSMT.”
 
 The committee was scheduled to arrive at 3pm but its visit was delayed to 4.30pm. The official added, “On normal days, we depute only around 20 TCs who net not more than 100 ticketless passengers and collect a total of Rs 30,000 in fines.” On Thursday, around 500 ticket-less passengers were caught. 
 
 Commuters said that the fact that so many were caught without a   at CSMT shows the enormity of the problem. A commuter, Ankit Joshi, said, “CSMT should have a fortress-like deployment of the TCs. There are a lot of commuters who board the first class without tickets.”
 
 Another CR official said, “There cannot be lopsided deployment of TCs as other railway stations are important too. However, heavy deployment is a norm whenever important dignitaries visit the station.”
 
 CR’s chief public relations officer Sunil Udasi said, “We undertake fortress checks at periodic intervals at several stations. Our ticket-checking performance too has improved.”
 
 During April and May this year, a total of 7.25 lakh cases of ticketless travel and unbooked luggage were detected as against 5.30 lakh cases during the corresponding period last year, thus registering an increase of 36.86% in the number of cases. An amount of Rs.41.22 crore was realized from them as fine against the Rs.29.10 crore last year, thus registering an increase of 41.67% in earnings.
