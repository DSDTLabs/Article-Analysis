NAGPUR: Taking cognisance of protests by Sitabuldi shopkeepers, Mahametro (earlier  ) officials have decided to allow two-wheelers on the road connecting Munje Square and   intersection. However, this road will remain open only for two to three months after which it will be completely closed. Traffic marshals appointed by Mahametro will not allow four wheelers to enter this road during the three month period. 

 The road is being closed for construction of Sitabuldi Interchange Metro station, which will be a 25-storey structure.
 
 Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Mahametro directors Mahesh Kumar and S Sivamathan said that they would break the road divider at a few places so that people can come out of Modi No 1, 2 and 3 and Hanuman Gali. “We will trim the footpath to create a two metre wide passage which can be used by two-wheelers. We will also request traffic police to make Sitabuldi main road two-way so that citizens can reach these lanes,” Kumar said.
 
 Replying to a query, Kumar said that while construction of Sitabuldi station would take two years, Mahametro would remove the barricades within one year. “We will provide free parking at   ground. Shop-owners and shoppers can park their vehicles and go to the affected area on foot,” he added.
 
 Sivamathan said the road near Zero Mile will also be closed partially as Mahametro intended to construct a basement parking below the Metro station. “We will first do piling work so that the road does not cave in when start digging,” he said.
 
 Commenting on the project finances, the director said that Mahametro required Rs1,100 crore in 2016-17 and this requirement had been met. “If   ( ) does not pay its share of Rs73 crore then Mahametro would seek an additional grant from state government,” he said adding that the agency needed Rs 2,700 crore in 2017-18.
