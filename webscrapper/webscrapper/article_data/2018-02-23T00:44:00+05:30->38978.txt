A study conducted by the School of Energy, Madurai Kamaraj University, found that household appliances also contribute to greenhouses gases, and indoor plants can help to tackle the problem, say experts.

 NASA’s Clean Air Study, has said that the common indoor plant may be the best way to overcome the sick building syndrome, which is attributed to poor indoor air quality. Plants which can be easily grown indoors with less requirement of sunlight were ideal ‘cleaners of the air’, said chairman of School of Energy, Madurai Kamaraj University, Dr K Muthuchezhian.
 
 He said that much is being said about trees being the best solution to all types of environmental pollution, including dust and air. But, trees take long to grow and with many people living in apartments growing a tree to tackle the pollution problem, may not be possible always. "But, there is always an alternative and the easily cultivable plants are the best solution, these plants require less care and grow well indoors. Many of these plants are sadly ‘stigmatized’ as unlucky plants. "But, what is needed today in every household, to bring lot of good luck and also good health, are some of these plants, in each room if possible’’, he said.
