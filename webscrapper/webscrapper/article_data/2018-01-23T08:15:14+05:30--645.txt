UDAIPUR: To curb the evil practice of   (death feast), the   community in   has resolved to limit the rituals to a minimum. Instead of a lavish spread on such occasions, only dal puri and a sweet would be served by families holding such feasts. 

 In a meeting of the community held at   on Sunday, members from several villages including Manpura, Siddhpura, Akhepur, Karamdi Kheda, etc., gave their consensus to many proposals put up for discussion. 
 
 “Mrityu Bhoj is a social evil and many poor families had been bearing the burden of age-old customs. Some even take loans to feed people following a death in their home,” spokesman   said. 
 
 Shri Lovesena, a voluntary group by Labana youths, had been trying for many years to curb this practice and had been sensitizing people on its bad effects in society.
