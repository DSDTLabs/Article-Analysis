NAVI MUMBAI: The standing committee   the Rs 3 crore amount allocated for removing encroachments to Rs 2 crore on Thursday, stating that there are not many encroachments in the city.

 But contradictory to the committee's view, the civic   department, along with Cidco, undertook demolition drive on Friday at a vacant plot opposite Nerul Gymkhana for the fifth consecutive time. “There is rampant encroachment all over the city and administration will need funds to employ adequate manpower and machinery to prevent such activities. Standing committee’s reason to believe otherwise is unknown,” said additional municipal commissioner Ankush Chavan.
 
 Officials also talked about problems they face while tackling encroachment. “We have undertaken multiple demolition drives in Nerul slums but as soon as officials leave the spot the structures are rebuilt. This time, we have taken it in writing from Cidco to fence the area,” he added.
 
 Even the nature of encroachment and the machinery required to demolish it is a problem administration has to tackle. 
 
 Slums can be razed with the help of JCBs and poclain machine, which don’t cost much. But administration has to seek stone crushers, costing upto Rs 30,000 per hour for demolishing multi-storey buildings. 
 
 “Tender bids seeking for suppliers of heavy machinery have not been receiving favourable response as the rates are not too high,” said a senior official from encroachment department. He added that unused funds could have easily been reallocated in December instead of reducing the  .
 
 Even residents have complained about encroachments in Vashi Sanpada and Koparkhairane. Unauthorized religious structures have come up in the tree belts at sector 2, Sanpada and Koparkhairane. “Officials needs to take note and take action,” said Shipra TP, a resident.
