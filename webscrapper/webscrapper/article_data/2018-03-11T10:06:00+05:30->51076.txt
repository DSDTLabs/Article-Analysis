 “I have just begun my journey and it was a huge learning curve for me in Guadalajara. These are small but significant steps for me before I reach my destination — the Olympic stage. Winning an Olympic gold is my ultimate goal,” she told TOI during an exclusive chat soon after landing in the city on Saturday evening.
 
 The teen shooter admitted that the World Cup experience made her realise the thin line between glory and gloom. “I’ve returned from Guadalajara after learning a number of lessons. One of them is how you need to be focused and consistent throughout your event. A momentary lapse in concentration can make huge difference in our sport,” she stated.
 
 Mehuli’s next target is to improve her performance in the Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Gold Coast, Australia, next month. Mehuli will attend the national camp in New Delhi before that.
 
 “She showed signs of maturity in Guadalajara. Normally, a debutant makes better scores in the qualification round and falters in the final. But the fact that she got her personal best in that stage and, that too, in her first World Cup, speaks volumes about her mental strength and maturity. I’m hopeful that she will bag a gold in the Commonwealth Games,” Olympian Joydeep Karmakar, who mentors Mehuli, said of his pupil.
