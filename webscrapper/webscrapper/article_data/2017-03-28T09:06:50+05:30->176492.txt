BENGALURU: A Sudanese and her three college-going children exchanged heated words with a citybased homemaker and her advocate in the magistrate   complex on   on Monday. Both parties went to   police station later and arrived at a compromise.

 Sources said the   nationals had come to court to give evidence in a cheating case. The homemaker, a party to the dispute, was in the court hall when the hearing was on. Later, when the Sudanese family walked out of the hall, the opposite party objected, saying the woman had made a false statement. “The Sudanese woman flew into a fit of rage and abused the homemaker. A verbal altercation ensued and both parties went to Ulsoorgate police station,“ police said.
 
 “We have registered a non-cognizable statement. No complaint or FIR was filed,“ police said.
