 Justin Bieber enjoyed a gruelling cycling session with Baskin Champion, who is rumoured to be his new girlfriend.

  
  
 According to a report, Bieber took a SoulCycle class in   on Thursday morning.
 
 He stayed covered up as he donned a grey sweatshirt.
 
 In addition to sporting the sweater's hoodie, the singer rocked a navy blue baseball cap.
 
 Staying comfortable for the intense workout session, he sported a pair of bright red basketball shorts with a yellow-and-white strip running down the side.
 
 Champion tried to stay incognito as she checked into a class alongside Bieber while sporting a matching grey sweatshirt.
 
 Her long blonde hair was covered with a large black hat that featured a patch which read, "Surf naked".
 
 The 22-year-old model rocked a pair of palm print leggings and fuzzy pink slippers as she left the class in an elevator.
 
 She was spotted emerging from Bieber's home later in the day, with wet hair, but also wearing the same clothes as earlier.
