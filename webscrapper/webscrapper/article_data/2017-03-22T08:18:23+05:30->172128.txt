BHAGALPUR: The Senate of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University on Monday cancelled the LLB degree of AAP MLA and Delhi’s former law minister  .

 The decision was taken after a marathon Senate meeting following a go-ahead from governor -cum- chancellor of the state universities Ram Nath Kovind to the TMBU Syndicate’s proposal.
 
 The Syndicate had earlier on December 3, 2016 ratified the decision of the TMBU’s examination board and disciplinary committee to cancel the degree. The Syndicate had sent its decision to the chancellor for his approval.
 
 The Syndicate had in December also approved legal proceedings against the university employees involved in the irregularities to help Tomar get the degree. 
 
 Tomar, claiming to be an LLB student of   (VSILS) between 1994 and 1998, secured the degree in September 2012. Over two years on, a controversy erupted when Tomar applied to the   for enrolment as a lawyer in February 2015. 
 
 VSILS is a unit of TMBU.
 
 A petition was filed in the Delhi high court, challenging Tomar’s university degrees on the basis of information collected through RTI inquiries. During a probe, Avadh University (Faizabad), from where Tomar claimed to have graduated and which was the basis of Tomar’s admission to the LLB course, denied having ever awarded any Bachelor’s degree to Tomar.
 
 On the other hand, TMBU submitted an affidavit before the Delhi high court, saying the provisional certificate bearing serial number 3687 dated July 29, 1999 was issued to Sanjay Kumar Choudhary (a student of R S College-Tarapur under TMBU) for BA (Honours) in Political Science examination, and not to Tomar for LLB.
 
 TMBU’s acting VC Kshemendra Kumar Singh, who presided over the Senate meeting, told this correspondent the Senate unanimously approved the cancellation of degree. “Now the   stands finally cancelled,” he added.
