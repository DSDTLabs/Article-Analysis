MADRID: Spanish separatist group   announced on Thursday it has ended its armed campaign and political efforts to create a Basque homeland, though the Spanish government vowed to continue prosecuting the organisation’s militants.

 
 ETA, which killed more than 850 people in its six decades of existence, said in an open letter to the Basque people that it has “completely dismantled all of its structures” and “will no longer express political positions, promote initiatives or interact with other stakeholders”.
 
 The letter was published by the Basque news website naiz.eus, a day after the group’s intentions were leaked in a letter.
