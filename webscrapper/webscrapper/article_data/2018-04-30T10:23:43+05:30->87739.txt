CHANDIGARH: Three months before the term of outgoing   vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar   gets over, the syndicate of the university on Sunday took back the powers it had delegated to him. 

 According to the Volume III and Chapter XLVII of PU calendar, there are around 34 powers that the syndicate delegates to the V-C. These powers include making appointments, selections, quashing of results, and admission of foreign scholars to the various courses.
 
 
  
  
 
 The syndicate members told Grover in the meeting that since he had no faith in the syndicate and senate of the university, the syndicate members too have lost faith in the vice-chancellor and that is why the House was taking back the powers. However, senator   gave his dissent on the decision.
 
 Sources said that the syndicate also resolved to form a three-member committee of senators Navdeep Goyal, Ashok Goyal and   to file an affidavit in the Punjab and Haryana high court through registrar of the university, seeking withdrawal of the affidavit filed by Grover on governance reforms.
 
 The syndicate members reiterated their demand that Grover should withdraw the affidavit filed by him in the Punjab and Haryana high court on governance reforms. However, Grover did not concede and said he would submit in the high court that he had filed that affidavit in his personal capacity.
 
 Member I S   said in the meeting Grover should put to the court that abiding by the orders of the syndicate, he was taking back the affidavit. Another member, Amit Joshi along with other syndicate members said it was their hand-folded request to withdraw the affidavit. However, Grover did not agree.
