NEW DELHI:   on Sunday demanded sacking of J&K   chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir, claiming that he was seen in a video terming the police probe in the Kathua rape-cum-murder case as motivated and defending the public protests against it.

 
 Congress rejected the demand and said it was because of Mir that the inquiry into the matter had seen progress initially. Citing BJP’s decision to remove two of its ministers who had joined the protests, Union minister Prakash Javadekar asked if Congress president   would only point fingers at others and maintain silence on the comments of his party’s state unit chief.
 
 In the video shown by BJP during a press meet at the party headquarters on Sunday, Mir is seen purportedly telling reporters that locals believed the probe was motivated and the main culprits were still at large.
 
 Javadekar said, “When our ministers expressed these sentiments, Congress and the media made a lot of noise. We took action. They resigned. Now we want to ask Rahul Gandhi why is he not taking action against his party’s state president?”
 
 Responding to the video released by BJP, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said, “Mir sahab has clearly said the video they are talking about is one or one-and-a-half months old. There was some progress, action in the case because of Mir sahab’s demand.”
 
 Khera termed as “misleading” the BJP’s talk of two state ministers resigning from their posts, saying it was because of the pressure exerted by people and the protest march led by Rahul.
 
 Meanwhile, reacting to Congress leader Dinesh Gundurao’s comment that the UP CM should be shown slippers, Javadekar said BJP condemned such remarks and claimed that the opposition party was trying to incite violence as it was afraid of losing the Karnataka assembly polls.
