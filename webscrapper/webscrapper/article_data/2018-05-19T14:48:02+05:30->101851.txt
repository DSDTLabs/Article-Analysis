INDORE: The Indore bench of   on Friday again directed inspector general of stamps and registrations to submit record on the number of flats registered in high -rises despite courtâ€™s order prohibiting the same without its permission.

 
 The earlier affidavit submitted by IG registration and stamps was placed on record on Wednesday in which IG stated that he could not stop registries of flats since the order was applicable to builders applying for registry and not the registrar, who had not even been a party in the petition.
 
 Division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice SK Awasthi reprimanded IG for not complying with the order and directed him to file affidavit with details of registries done by him. The court granted four weeks to the state government to file the affidavit on record and listed the matter after summer vacations on July 4. The state government meanwhile, also submitted their reply to the application moved by the petitioner seeking to implead three registrars in Indore and IG registration and stamps to be made party to the petition.
 
 The state has opposed them being pled as parties to the petition since the petition had only sought relief with regard to director of town and country planning department and that the registrars were not necessary respondents to the petition.
 
 The petition filed by Pradeep Hinduja has sought for fixing or residential density norms for high rise buildings. The court through an interim order in October 2017 had prohibited the creation of any third party interest in the high rise buildings of Indore without the permission of the court.
