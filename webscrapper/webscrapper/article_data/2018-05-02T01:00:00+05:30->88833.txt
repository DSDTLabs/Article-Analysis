Apart from being a successful director,   continues to be one of the most sought after choreographers too, having choreographed over 150 songs in the course of her career. While dancing will always remain her passion, Farah has become selective about the songs she chooses to choreograph, and the upcoming film Veere Di Wedding’s Tareefan is one of those special tracks. Despite her busy schedule, Farah came on board to direct and choreograph the promotional song that has been composed by Qaran Mehta.

 Featuring rapper Badshah, Tareefan is a role reversal song with four instances of girls taking on roles stereotypically assumed by their male counterparts. Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam Kapoor, Swara Bhasker and   set temperatures soaring, as these boss ladies step it up and have some ‘boy style’ fun in their stilettos. The song was shot over a two-day schedule at a studio in Mumbai.
 
 Talking about Tareefan, Farah says, “This is the second music video that I have conceptualised after Bluffmaster’s Ek Main Aur Ek Tu Hai. We’ve taken this song to the next level. The concept of a gender swap really appealed to me, so we made the boys the decorative pieces in the song, with the girls being the heroes. It was fun working with some truly empowered and enlightened women like Rhea (Kapoor), Ekta (Kapoor), Kareena, Sonam, Swara and Shikha.”
 Veere Di Wedding, directed by   and produced by Shobha Kapoor, Anil Kapoor, Ekta Kapoor, Rhea Kapoor and  , releases on June 1.
