LUCKNOW: Changing his political script with a dizzying regularity,   patriarch   said on Monday that   would be the next chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. The move is being seen as back-pedalling by the veteran politician, who had earlier stated, on numerous occasions, that the next CM would be chosen by the elected MLAs after this year’s assembly polls.

 But, Mulayam’s statement failed to address issues that had pushed the party towards a split.   had demanded a free hand in the selection of candidates, which remained unaddressed. Also Mulayam’s cryptic statement didn’t throw light on who is SP president.
 
 The move is being seen as the wily Yadav chief ’s attempt to win over Akhilesh and isolate  , whom he has described as the “only person responsible for misleading his son”. Earlier in the day, Mulayam had written to Rajya Sabha chairman informing him about Ram Gopal’s expulsion from SP.
 
 “
  (Akhilesh will be the next CM),” Mulayam told a news agency.
 
 Mulayam, who also went to the   to stake claim to his party’s ‘bicycle’ election symbol, said later in Lucknow that there was no question of any split in the party. He also said he would go out to campaign soon. Mulayam and Akhilesh are likely to meet at 10 am on Tuesday, sources said.
 
 The statement is being seen as Mulayam’s attempt to reassure Akhilesh’s supporters, who have been apprehensive of a plot to dislodge him by not projecting him as the future face of the party. Observers said there was a need to take Mulayam’s statement with caution in light of his recent flip-flops.
 
 On Sunday, talking to party workers at his Ashoka Road residence in New Delhi, Mulayam had said that Akhilesh was his son and “let him do what he wanted to”.
