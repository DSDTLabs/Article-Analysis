MUMBAI : A  , who had arrested Zabiuddin Ansari alias   in June 2012 informed a   in Mumbai on Monday that no private person was willing to be a panch witness. It was a police official who had to become an independent  , said Chandra while being cross-examined by defence lawyer Wahab Khan before special judge G A Sanap in the 2008 terror attack trial.

 A   and identity cards were found in Jundal’s possession but the police said he was arrested near IGI airport in Delhi.
 
 Khan’s questions towards the police officer were aimed at demolishing the prosecution case of his arrest outside the airport as he said Zabiuddin had been brought from Saudi Arabia by flight and two of Chandra’s subordinate officers had gone earlier from India to get him back from Damam.
 
 During the cross-examination, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam objected to the questions posed several times. The officer confirmed there was no visa or stamp found on the Pakistani passport seized from Jundal after his arrest. On being asked by Wahab, he said he had not had any correspondence with Pakistan to verify genuineness of the passport.
