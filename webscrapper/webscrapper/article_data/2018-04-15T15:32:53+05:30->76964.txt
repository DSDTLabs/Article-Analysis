Actor   has played intense characters in movies like Anurag Kashyap’s ' ' and Sudhir Mishra’s ' '. Both characters have an edge and the actor reveals that such roles always take a toll on an actor. He says, “If an actor is true to his craft, then, a small piece of the person that you become in your performance stays with you as long as you live. When I shot for 'Ugly', I stopped sleeping. I needed to look like a man on the edge and that’s how I got there. But, after the film I realised, my sleeping patterns had changed completely. I just couldn’t sleep anymore. I still can’t. Now I regularly go to sleep at 4 am. To wear myself down, I watch two films every night. That’s become a routine for me.” 

 He’s played an alcoholic in both films but he maintains that both characters are unique. He explains, “Both Rahul (from 'Ugly') and Dev (from 'Daas Dev') are addicted to alcohol. But their journeys are so different. As an actor it’s my job to bring something new to the role. So I try and sneak in a few nuances to each role. Dev, for example is also obsessed with power. So his addictions have shades of love and power apart from the usual alcoholic turn.”
