KOLHAPUR: Visitors to the   are set to get a glimpse of renovated and   premises around next month-end. 

 The Town Hall building, built in 1876, hosts the Kolhapur museum which has hundreds of artefacts found during the excavation done in 1945- 1946 near Bramhapuri, an ancient village on the banks of Panchganga river. Over the years, other interesting historical objects have been added to the collection. 
 
 Work on renovation of the building premises, including laying new pavement, cleaning the two-century old structure, began in April last year and is set to be completed by June-end.
 
 Amrut Patil, assistant curator of the museum, said the work of digging up 2 ft around the Town hall premises has helped clear centuries old gutters and levelled the pathways. 
 
 “The area around the town hall structure had gathered at least 2 ft of dust on the original surface. We have dug the area to retain the original look. Along with it, the gutters which were covered due to the soil were also cleared up. The fountain area too has been dug and has retained its original look,” he said. 
 
 In addition, around 40 vintage style street poles will be installed with LED lights in coming days. However, the parking facility needs to be looked after by the   (KMC) and a request will be made to the authorities.
 
 “Now, the number of visitors is gradually increasing. Hence, we need to have some kind of separate parking facility for the visitors on an urgent basis,” Patil said.
 
 The state government had sanctioned Rs 1.9 crore for the work. The current work is being done in full speed under the first instalment of Rs 1 crore.
 
 Earlier, the renovation and revamp of the interiors of the museum was done in 2012. Unlike the renovation work done then, when the museum was closed for almost three years, the museum was open for general public during all this time.
