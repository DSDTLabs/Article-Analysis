AHMEDABAD: In over a month residents of Bodakdev and Jodhpur wards in the new west zone have been annoyed by the frequent   and   problems. 

 In separate incidents at Bodakdev and Jodhpur ward offices, angry residents even created a ruckus and threatened to approach the chief minister for redressal of their complaints.
 
 “Everyday we face an issue of low pressure water supply in Bodakdev. We pay the highest taxes in the city, but get the worst of services. We have had enough,” says Piyush Chokshi of Vrundavan Apartments in Bodakdev.
 
 On Wednesday alone Bodakdev and Jodhpur wards of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) registered 20 and 18 complaints respectively for just water and drainage issues. The   officials claim that the works related to water metering for 24x7 water supply is on in Jodhpur ward because of which there are issues with water supply.
 
 In February alone, Bodakdev ward witnessed 206 complaints, most of which were related to drainage and water supply  . Some of the areas that have been complaining include Sadhbhav Flats, Kailashnagar, Sigma Apartments, Shanti Medical Area, Thakor Vas, Sharda School and Jambhuvan among others. Jodhopur ward has in the same period witnessed 173 drainage and water supply problems. Areas like Jain Sasan nagar, Shiv Nagar, Setu bungalows, Mahabaleshwar flats, Gokul Awas have been frequently complaining of poor water supply. 
 
 In case of drainage issues in Jodhpur, Shivam bungalows, Palak 2, Sonlai flats and   have registered their complaints. “Sometimes ward officials close our complaints online without even verifying with us whether the complaints have been solved or not. I suspect that the AMC supply lines cannot match the capacity needed against the number of building permissions they are issuing. There has to be a check,” says another resident of Kameshwar Flats, Jayant Hirpara.
