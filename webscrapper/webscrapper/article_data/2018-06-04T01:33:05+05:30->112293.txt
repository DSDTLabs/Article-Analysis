LOS ANGELES: A shooter opened fire in downtown   and was taken into custody Sunday as thousands of people participated in the California city's marathon, police said.

 
 A woman fired shots in a parking structure near the finish line of the San Diego Rock 'n' Roll Marathon, according to the local CBS and   television affiliates, which said a police officer was reportedly injured by an accidental, self-inflicted gunshot wound to the leg or foot.
 
 "There's no longer a threat to the community. The scene is secure. The Rock and Roll Marathon has resumed," the San Diego Police Department said in a tweet.
