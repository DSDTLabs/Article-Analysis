KOLHAPUR: The transportation wing of   ( ) staged a protest and shouted slogans against various licence fee hikes and shut the   (RTO) for more than two hours on Monday.

 The Central government hiked various fees through its 22nd amendment in Motor Vehicle Act 1989. The government has increased fees from leaner’s licence to late passing fees and renovation of licenses. The RTO has started charging fees as per the new rule of the government resolution.
 
 Raju Jadhav, district president of transportation wing, said, “We are against the hike. The RTO is charging new rates for dues before the government resolution came into effect. It cannot be justified. We demanded the copy of resolution but the RTO did not give it to us. So, we shouted slogans and stopped the working of RTO for more than two hours.”
 
 He added, “Regional transport officer   did not accept our petition of demands. We appealed to the people not to pay the fees as per the new rates. The officials at RTO are not cooperative and hesitate to share information with us. We have given an ultimatum till next Wednesday to revoke the fees. If they fail to do it, we will increase the intensity of our agitation.”
 
 Meanwhile, Pawar said, “We have sent the petition of demands to the government. We are charging the fees as per government’s decision. We don’t have any right to change or alter the fees. If anybody interrupts our functioning, we will take legal action against them. It is Central government’s decision and we need to follow it.”
