 AHMEDABAD:  , the 193rd-ranked Indian, has given herself a chance to enter the main draw of the French Open at   this year after being included in the list of qualifiers released by the WTA on Wednesday.
 
 
 Ankita, after losing in the second round to second seed Yafang Wang at WTA Kunming Open in Anning, China, told TOI: “My dream has come true. Right from the time I started playing tennis, the dream was to play in Grand Slam. “I have grown up watching   and Maria Sharapova. This is a huge moment for me and my country.”
 
 
 
 Ankita will next be in action on the ITF women’s circuit in Luan next week. Her entry into the qualifying draw of the French Open comes on the back of consistent performances on the ITF and WTA circuit this year, says Ankita’s coach Hemant Bendrey.
 
 “The WTA Mumbai Open in November last, where she was a quarterfinalist, was when she took the next step,” Bendrey told TOI. “The improvement in her game was clearly evident in the Federation Cup early this year in New Delhi, where she defeated two players ranked above her. Though she won the ITF $25,000 in Gwalior in March this year, her performances (in Japan and China on ITF circuit) could have been better.”
