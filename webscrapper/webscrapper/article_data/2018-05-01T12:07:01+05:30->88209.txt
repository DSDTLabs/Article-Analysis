SALIGAO: A delegation of residents of   and Calangute, led by former MLA Agnelo Fernandes, submitted a representation to   Pandurang Madkaikar on Monday demanding for an early solution to the erratic power supply that the two villages have been facing for some time now.

 Fernandes said as the electricity department failed to rectify the situation, despite leading a ‘morcha’ to the office of the assistant engineer nearly two weeks ago, they called on the power minister on Monday as a last resort.
 
 Madkaikar assured them that he would look into the matter and sought 15 days time to decide on the solution. “We will wait for 15 days, failing which we’ll launch an agitation,” Fernandes said.
 
 Madkaikar said that the state government has taken up an initiative to lay a 33kv line from Canca to Candolim and from Porvorim to   and that the transmission situation will improve within 45 days. 
 
 The locals also protested against the hike in tariff.
