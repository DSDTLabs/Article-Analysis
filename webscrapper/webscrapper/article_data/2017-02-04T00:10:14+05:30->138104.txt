New Delhi: The menace of on-road   continues to grow and traffic police seem to have few answers. Rampant encroachments and lack of a land-use policy are hurdles that need to be overcome urgently if the city has to be made congestion-free.

 Simply put, there is hardly any alternative space where vehicles can be parked. Police sources, however, say that a hefty increase in fines for illegal parking and making multilevel parking cheaper could be the starting point.
 
 Police are preparing a list — to be submitted to civic agencies — of 21 stretches that are hit badly due to obstructive parking. Traffic cops maintain that personal vehicles must be made stakeholders in the plan to decongest the city. A police officer said: “Parking space comes at a cost. According to an estimate, if only the capital cost of providing multilevel parking was to be recovered, each car owner would need to pay Rs 100 an hour. Any charge below that would amount to subsidy.”
 
 Special commissioner (traffic) Ajay Kashyap says that apart from enforcing no-parking laws, vehicle owners need to be provided with proper space. “We would propose that the government come up with a concrete anti-encroachment and transport policy. We can issue a challan, but its purpose will be served only when the driver is directed towards another parking space after paying the fine,” says Kashyap.
 
 Rohit Baluja, president of Institute of Road Traffic and Education, calls for stricter enforcement of no-parking laws. “It must start with enforcement. Traffic police should let civic bodies and government think about policies and space allocation,” says Baluja.
 
 A stronger land-use policy is equally important. The stretch between South-Ex and AIIMS could be a case study in this regard .
