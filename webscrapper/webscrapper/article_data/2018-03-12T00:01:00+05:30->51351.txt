Pune: While it may be fairly simple to get an International Driving Permit (IDP), the driving standards of Indian motorists are not considered amongst the best. Many, therefore, believe the tests to obtain a driving licence in India must be made stricter to ensure safe driving habits — in the country and abroad.

 Indians settled overseas say while the Indian RTOs issue IDPs in accordance with international conventions, the issuance of normal driving licences too must meet  .
 
 Sachi Modi-Khakhria, currently a Dubai resident, speaks from experience. “Despite having an Indian license, it took me years to be able to get a driving licence in Dubai. The process, as well as the tests, are very stringent. Dubai has left-hand drive and vehicles are driven at such high speeds that if you do not follow traffic rules, there could be fatal accidents. I haven’t heard of too many Indian drivers violating traffic rules here as they have to pay heavy fines in Dirhams. They are not allowed to return to India without paying up.”
 
 An Indian student in Australia, Yash Khandelwal too warns of the heavy fines imposed on traffic violators. “The average fine for a minor traffic violation is AUS $500. People coming from India, many who do not follow traffic rules back home, must be prepared to follow rules in Australia or any other country. Licences in India are easily issued, in certain cases even to people who do not attend the driving tests in person. There is a need for a stricter procedure and tests to obtain a driving licence in India,” he says.
 
 Shivam Singh, a student in Budapest, says, “Getting a license in Hungary is not difficult. One test needs to be cleared to obtain a licence here. However, driving tests are way more tough and Indians often need multiple attempts to obtain licences abroad. Indian tests should be of international standards as well.”
