AHMEDABAD: The supply of new residential properties took beating as realtors grappled with   (Regulation and Development) Act ( ) and Goods and   (GST) last year. Ahmedabad real estate market witnessed 52% decline, the steepest in percentage terms among top eight cities in India, in launches of new residential units during 2017.

 According to the data compiled by real estate consultant Cushman and Wakefield (C&W), 4,680 residential units were launched in 2017 as compared to 9,713 units in 2016.
  
  
 “Ahmedabad saw a decline in the total number of residential units launched in 2017 mirroring the national trend. Here the thrust has been on the affordable housing which has mostly remained unchanged from last year with only a minor decline of 2%,” said Anshul Jain, country head and managing director, India, C&W.
 
 Almost half of new residential launches in Ahmedabad were in affordable segment (2,532 units).
 
 Cumulatively, launch of residential units in eight cities — Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Kolkata — dipped by 35% to 73,956 units in 2017 from 1,13,044 units in the previous year. Launches of residential units in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Chennai dropped by 51%, 47% 45% and 44%, respectively.
 
 According to real estate sector experts, implementation of RERA and GST in quick succession, few months after demonetization, took their toll on real estate market.
 
 However, government’s push to affordable housing segment and clarity with regard to affordable housing has led to a rise of 6% in affordable unit launches. A total 31,241 units were launched in affordable segment in top eight cities cumulatively. The number stood at 29,410 in 2016.
 
 “With continued stability at the political front and national government’s push for affordable housing, we can expect to see the sector to see further traction going forward. However, similar to national trend, it will be a while before the residential demand starts to pick pace,” added Jain.
 
 Not just residential units launches, supply of office space in Ahmedabad also declined by 18% to 27.27 lakh sq ft in 2017 as compared to 33.16 lakh sq ft recorded in 2016, states another estimate by C&W. “Lower absorption of office space may led to reduced supply in office space category,” said Dipak Patel, former president of city-based real estate body GIHED-CREDAI.
