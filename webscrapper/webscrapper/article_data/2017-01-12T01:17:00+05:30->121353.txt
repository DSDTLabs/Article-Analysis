NAVI MUMBAI: Several children from the economically weaker section were denied entry to the Navi Mumbai Mayor’s Trophy   tournament due to lack of the right footwear.

 Navi Mumbai Sport Association’s (NMSA) administration made it compulsory for the participants, in the tournament that kicked off on Tuesday, to wear special gum-sole  . 
 
 The administration stated that the club spent lakhs of rupees preparing the badminton court turf in Vashi, which was at par with the international standard facility, and ordinary shoes would damage it.
 
 Hence, several civic school students, who could not afford to buy the shoes, were unable to participate, despite   being the organizer of the event.
 
 A parent of a civic school student said, “My 17 -year-old son is an excellent badminton player, but we cannot afford to buy the expensive shoes, therefore, my son could not display his talent.”
 
 He added that experts in the sports arena have claimed that at any badminton tournament, the players were allowed to play barefoot if they do not have gum sole shoes. “But, NMSA is apparently an exception,” he added. The administration clarified that they could not allow the participants to play bare foot, as they would injure their ankles.
 
 Dr Dilip Rane, president, NMSA said, “Players need to abide by the rules. The organizers need to provide gum-sole shoes to the participants who do not have them.” 
 
 Mayor Sudhakar Sonawane said he would request concerned additional municipal commissioner to allocate a budget for providing gum-sole shoes to those who could not afford them .
