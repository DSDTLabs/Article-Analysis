PATNA: The   on Monday asked the state government to come up with an action plan by April 10 to curb   in Patna. 

 A division bench of chief justice   and Justice S Kumar issued the oral directive while hearing a batch of PILs over noise pollution in Patna. 
 
 The court also asked for suggestions to be submitted to the advocate general and the state government from those complaining about noise pollution.
 
 Meanwhile, experts said three-wheelers were the main reason for noise pollution in the city. “Auto drivers remove filter from the vehicle’s silencer, which decreases the consumption of fuel but increases the noise,” said a   official.
 
 “Other reasons for noise pollution in the city are constant honking by motor vehicles, generator sets and construction activities without barriers,” the official said.
 
 He said green foliage is an effective deterrent for noise pollution. “Plants form a natural barrier for noise pollution and also help reduce air pollution. We have plans to encourage plantation on both sides of the road,” he said. 
 
 Other methods by which noise pollution can be curbed are use of soundless generators and use of barrier curtains around construction activities. “We are also planning to issue ‘No horn’ stickers for vehicles,” the official said.
