NOIDA: A 50-year-old activist from Uttarakhand helped save at least four lives after her death as four organs from her body were transplanted to four other persons.

 While the heart, liver and kidneys of the woman were transplanted to four persons, her eyes have been donated to an eye bank by her family.
 
 The   traffic police created two green corridors to ensure speedy travel of the organs on Tuesday morning. It took 20 minutes to transport the heart to   in Saket from  , Sector 128, Noida, while the kidney was transported to Max Hospital in Vaishali in 18 minutes.
 
 The first corridor was created at 6.30am and the second at 7.30am. The liver and the second kidney were used by Jaypee Hospital to transplant them into two persons.
 
 While the liver has been transplanted to a 42-year-old man from Hapur, the kidney has been used to save a 35-year-old kidney patient from Dwarka.
 
 Gita Devi, a resident of Badalu village in Pittoragarh district, worked as an activist with Mahila Yuvak Mandal Dal, a local organisation promoting women’s education and other social causes in the area.
 
 “Gita lost her husband at a very young age and stayed with her parents for the rest of her life. She would encourage girls to take up sports and would help them visit places like Dehradun with her father’s support. Being a retired army officer he supported her a lot,” B P Joshi, the woman’s cousin, told TOI.
 
 Gita suffered a brain stroke and was brought to Kailash Hospital on April 28 from where she was shifted to Jaypee Hospital the next day. She was declared brain-dead by the doctors at the hospital on Monday night, following which the family members agreed to donate her organs.
