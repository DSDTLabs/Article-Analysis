BENGALURU: With the exit polls predicting a fractured verdict in Karnataka, the race for the chief minister’s post is set to widen beyond incumbent Siddaramaiah and BJP and JD(S) CM candidates B S Yeddyurappa and H D Kumaraswamy, respectively.

 
 In the event of a hung assembly and the JD(S) and Congress forming the government, the former will have a greater say in choosing the CM candidate like it did in 2004. The party had then backed Dharam Singh, overlooking the claims of other seniors like Mallikarjun Kharge.
 
 
  
  
 
 JD(S) has a wide pool to choose from: Kharge, KPCC president G Parameshwara, chairman of Congress campaign committee D K Shivakumar, seven-time MP K H Muniyappa and industries minister R V Deshpande who are aspiring to be CM.
 
 “In a coalition government, the CM should be acceptable to both the partners. Hence, the JD(S) becomes more important. It will definitely opt for a political lightweight amenable to it and not an assertive leader with base in any community. A ‘weak’ CM will give them the control over the government,” said a political analyst.
 
 
  
  
 
 The possibility of someone other than Yeddyurappa from BJP becoming the CM cannot be ruled out either, if the JD(S) decides to go with the saffron party. In such a scenario, Jagadish Shettar, D V Sadananda Gowda, Ballari MP B Sreeramulu, K S Eshwarappa and Govind Karjol could be the dark horses.
 
 “JD(S) may also back a Dalit for the CM’s post and claim credit for making a Dalit the CM for the first time in Karnataka. This will also help the party make inroads into the Dalit voter base,” said a senior Congress leader.
