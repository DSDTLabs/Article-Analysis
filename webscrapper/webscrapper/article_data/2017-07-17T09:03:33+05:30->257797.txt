NEW DELHI:   worth nearly Rs 93 lakh was seized at the   airport by   officials from a passenger bound for Dubai. The currency had reportedly been concealed inside a metallic container of a ‘ghee’ brand.

 The incident took place on Friday when the passenger, an Indian national, heading for flight no 6E-023 was intercepted by Customs sleuths at the departure hall of Terminal 3.
 
 Officials said that upon close inspection and scanning of his baggage, something ‘suspicious’ was detected inside a metallic container. The container marked as ‘Gopala Desi Ghee’ which had been sealed, was physically checked and foreign currency in the form of US dollars, officials added.
 
 “A detailed examination of the luggage led to the finding of $1,44,800 inside it, which in Indian currency is worth Rs 92.59 lakh. The passenger was taken into custody for further interrogation. We suspect he may have been carrying it for someone else,” said an official.
 
 Customs sleuths added that the passenger was intercepted on the basis of surveillance and random checks which are often conducted in the departure hall. Customs department had seized foreign currency worth nearly Rs 33 lakh on July 6, which was in the form of Saudi Riyal and Kuwaiti Dinar. In another case, foreign currency worth Rs 1 crore was found concealed in the trolley baggage of a 63-year-female passenger who was acting as a carrier.
 
 “While gold is brought into the country by different means, we keep an eye on the departure hall for foreign currency. In a lot of the cases, people act as carriers, taking currency from India to deliver it to an individual abroad,” said a Customs official.
