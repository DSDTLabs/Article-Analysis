Mumbai: A   bench, headed by Justice Swatanter Kumar, on Tuesday passed an order banning the use of synthetic and nylon  , also known as  , for flying kites. 

 The order excludes cotton thread when coated with a degradable material.
 
 The order was in response to a petition of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India in August 2016, calling for a nationwide   on sharp kite strings. In December 2016, the tribunal issued an interim ban on the production, sale, procurement and import of all forms of manja and allowed kite-flying only with plain cotton thread.
 
 “This prohibition on the use of synthetic and nylon ma-nja is a lifesaving step. Now, we must press on until all dangerous manja is banned,” said PETA lead-public policy Nikunj Sharma. “Particularly worrying is glass-coated manja that causes injury and even death.”
 
 PETA was represented by senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, who scientifically demonstrated to the court that except for uncoated plain cotton threads traditionally known as saddi, all other sharp kite-flying threads cause grievous injuries to humans and birds. He also argued that these are non-biodegradable, thus a threat to the environment.
 
 Thousands of birds die every year when they they either get cut or trapped in manja. On January 14, during  , nearly 100 birds were injured by sharp kite strings in Mumbai. Around 350 injured birds are reported to various animal workers and hospitals, including BSPCA in Parel, every year.
