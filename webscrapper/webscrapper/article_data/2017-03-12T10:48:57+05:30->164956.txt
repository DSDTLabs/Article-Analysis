MAJHA: Majha played a vital role in Congress's victory with the party winning 22 out of 25 seats in the region. AAP, on the other hand, was disappointed on all seats. What's more,   and Akali leaders who had shifted loyalty to the Congress ahead of assembly elections won their seats with huge margins. The incumbent alliance got only two seats in Majha.

 In 2012, Congress won just eight seats in Majha. The SAD-BJP combine pocketed 17. While the two sides were locked in a neck and neck battle in the numerically larger Malwa belt, it was the Majha setback that consigned the Congress to another five years in opposition.
 
 Former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu is now Congress MLA from Amritsr East assembly constituency, earlier represented by his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu. BJP had fielded its district president Rajesh Honey, a relatively weaker candidate before the celebrity stature of Sidhu, which contributed to the huge victory margin of 42,709 votes.
 
 Similarly, former SAD MLA from Amritsar South constituency, Inderbir Singh Bolaria, who had shifted loyalty to Congress, once again won by defeating AAP's Inderbir Singh Nijjar.
 
 Congress candidate from Amritsar Centre, Om Parkash Soni, managed to retain his seat by trouncing BJP's national secretary Tarun Chugh. Riding the party wave, Soni even managed to increase the victory margin.
 
 From the keenly watched Majitha constituency, revenue minister Bikram Majithia defeated Congress's Sukhjinder Raj Singh Lalli Majithia by a margin of 22,884 votes. AAP's Himmat Singh barely managed 10,252 votes.
