PATNA: The IT raids on properties linked to   and his family and a steady stream of disclosures about their acquisition of hitherto unknown assets appear to be straining the RJD boss’s alliance with  , who has remained aloof to the mounting problems of his ally.

 The tension showed through on Tuesday when   reacted to the IT raids on shell companies linked to property acquired by his daughter   and her spouse by tweeting: “BJP ko naye alliance partners mubarak ho. Main jhukne aur darnewala nahi hoon. (Congrats to   for acquiring new allies. I’m not going to be cowed down).”
 
 
 
 In fact, the raids came a day after Nitish’s statement that the alleged   of Lalu’s family were out of the state government’s purview, hinting that the Centre was free to act if it had enough evidence.
 
 Although Lalu soon clarified in another tweet that the alliance was intact and BJP should not feel good, this failed to allay the perception of a growing rift. Sources said   is worried about the fallout of the revelations on his image and the credibility of his government. 
 
 He is particularly annoyed that Lalu’s two sons, both ministers, did not disclose details of all the assets owned by him.
