NEW DELHI: A gang of   used to replace the original key of a vehicle with a replica if its doors were left unlocked during cleaning in the morning. The gang would then keep a watch and a member would soon flee with a car whenever it would be parked away from the locality in south and   colonies. 

 The gang was busted on Tuesday night following a shootout with crime branch officials in Najafgarh and seven luxury vehicles, stolen from across the city, were recovered. The kingpin, Pramod Ganja (33), involved in more than a dozen criminal cases in Delhi and UP, was barred from entering Delhi. 
 
 The gang had stolen nine vehicles, including a Honda City and a Toyota Fortuner. It used to sell these cars in the second-hand vehicle market. 
 
 Joint commissioner (crime) Alok Kumar said a team had been tracking him for the past few days after he was found to be involved in orchestrating a number of car thefts in the last few months. “We got to know that he would travel towards Najafgarh in a stolen vehicle and intercepted him. He opened fire at the police team but was caught,” said Kumar.
 
 Pramod, who is from Mangolpuri, told interrogators led by ACP Aditya Gautam that he had teamed up with another auto lifter, Mohit Sharma, and stole luxury cars from NCR colonies on specific orders, said DCP (crime) Bhisham Singh. The owners would usually blame the cleaners for the loss of keys and use duplicate ones, said a source. 
 
 The police have also found a pistol and a few cartridges on him.
