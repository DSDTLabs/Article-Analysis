LUCKNOW: With the required   of water at the raw-water pumping station of Gaughat falling by four inches on Wednesday,   is worried about providing a continuous water supply to the city in the coming days. 

 Gaughat station supplies   to two important reservoirs, Aishbagh and Balaganj, feeding over 20 lakh people daily. Gaughat needs a water level of 346.9 feet above the ground to run the pumps smoothly. However, in summers when the water level starts declining, it becomes difficult for the pumps to function at a lower level. To avoid this situation, a government order was issued almost 15 years ago, mandating the irrigation department to release 100 cusecs of water to Gomti every April and May to maintain the water level during summers.
 
 Though the department released water from Sharda canal in April, it had to stop it midway because of ongoing railway bridge construction over the canal in Bareilly. A source in irrigation department said, “To facilitate the construction of bridge over the canal, we had to remove water. Hence, we couldn’t supply it to Gomti in May.” The department said they had received a letter from Jal Sansthan in April for 100 cusecs of water from Sharda canal but they hadn’t received any such requirement in May. 
 
 “The low level has started causing problems in the functioning of pumps and may deteriorate if the department doesn’t release water soon,” said Neeraj Gaur, secretary, Jal Sansthan.
