NEW DELHI: The mere mention of ‘at owner’s risk’ on the parking tag does not absolve a   if a vehicles goes missing from its parking space and it will be construed as ‘negligence’, the country’s   ordered on Monday.

 The order was passed by single-member bench of M Shreesha while hearing the case of a Maruti Zen being stolen from the parking lot of   in Delhi in August 1998 after the car owner left it at the valet parking. Holding the hotel responsible, the   (NCDRC) ordered it to pay Rs 2.8 lakh to  , which had insured the car, and pay interest at 9% from January 28, 1999.
 
 One Sapan Dhawan had gone to the hotel on August 1, 1998 to have dinner at 11 pm and had given the keys to the parking man. He had received a parking slip. When he retuned after dinner two hours later and asked for the key, he was informed that his car was driven away by some unknown person. 
 
 The hotel had denied any negligence on its part when Dhawan sought Rs 5.3 lakh as compensation. He approached the Delhi state commission, which ordered Rs 2.8 lakh compensation to the insurance company and Rs 1 lakh to Dhawan. Though the hotel paid Dhawan, it challenged the order in NCDRC.
 
 The hotel argued there was no negligence on its part and the parking slip clearly mentioned the vehicle was being parked at the request of the guest at his own risk.
 
 But the NCDRC observed that as per the doctrine of ‘infra hospitium’, the hotel’s ‘duty of care’ towards guests’ vehicle does not stop with mere parking of the vehicles. 
 
 “...When the parking tag is issued in the name of the hotel, it can be reasonably inferred by the ‘car owner’ that the car would be in the ‘duty of care’ and custody of the hotel, which in this case, it failed to exercise and is held liable to pay damages,” NCDRC member Shreesha said.
