PANAJI: The power department has submitted a proposal of Rs 1,700 crore to the central government to upgrade infrastructure in the state, power minister   said on Friday. 

 The proposal was prepared together with Tata Power. 
 
 “Union minister for power   agreed to provide at least 50% in the form of a grant and some part in the form of long-term loans,”   said. 
 
 The present infrastructure is more than 25 years old and cannot take the present load, he said, adding that uninterrupted power supply can only be ensured once the infrastructure is upgraded. 
 
 The state has received Rs 50 crore to replace mechanical and non-functional metres in the state under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana and the   of the central government for rural and urban areas, respectively.
 
 Madkaikar said the power scenario in the state would be revamped in the next three years once infrastructure was updated.
