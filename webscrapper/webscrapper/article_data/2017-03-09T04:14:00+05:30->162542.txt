Nagpur: The Maharashtra government, on Wednesday, categorically denied granting furlough to underworld don Arun  . In its affidavit, it was stated that furlough can not be granted after new rules came into the force since August 28 last year.

 A division bench comprising justice Bhushan Gavai and justice Indira Jain adjourned the hearing till next week, after Gawli’s counsel Mir Nagman Ali sought time to reply on the affidavit.
 
 The court was hearing the gangster’s plea challenging constitutional validity of Rule 4 (11) of Maharashtra Prisons (Parole and Furlough) Rules. These rules prohibit prisoners from applying for furlough if their appeals against conviction are pending with the higher courts. The DIG (Prisons, East) and Central Jail superintendent have been made respondents in the case.
 
 Ali contended that Rule 4 (11) is violative of Article 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. “The rule makes a classification which is not based on any intelligible differentia. It has no nexus with the object sought to be achieved. Moreover, there is no rationale behind making such a rule.”
 
 He argued that the new rules are contradictory to Rule 3 of ‘Maharashtra Prisons Parole and Furlough Rules’ which lays down that, a murder convict should be granted furlough after undergoing imprisonment of three years. Merely because appeal is pending does not mean that the prisoner loses status of convict and thus right to get furlough, he said.
 
 The gangster-turned-politician was convicted for murder of Shiv Sena MLA Kamalakar Jamsandekar on August 3, 2012, along with 11 others and was awarded rigorous life imprisonment. He, along with 11 others, was brought to Nagpur Central Jail in March last year, after being awarded life sentence, which is probably his first ever conviction.
