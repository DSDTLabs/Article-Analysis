BHOPAL: In wake of the decision of the   to ban polythene bags in the state from May 1, traders and residents anxiously await its impact on their lives. 

 Shopkeepers feel that it may lead to increase in cost of products as paper carry bags are costlier while citizens think the decision is good but are all at sea as regards availability of an alternative.
 
 “Polythene ban will come with some issues. But as every good thing comes with a problem, I am ready to face it. At least it will help in environment conservation,” said  , a homemaker who lives in BHEL.
 
 “Though it is a good move for environment, the government should have ensured that paper bags are easily available before imposing a ban on polybags,” said Pradyumn Tayde who lives on Hoshangabad Road and is an engineer in a private firm.
 
 Vegetable seller Anu Ramnani told TOI, “On an average, I use 250 polythene bags everyday at my stall. From tomorrow onwards, customers will have to bring their own bags because if I start providing them paper bags, I will have to levy charge and products will become costlier.”
 
 Some shopkeepers also think there will be a practical problem with the ban. Ravi, a dairy product shop owner, said, “How will I sell items like curd that I give in polythene bag? If I go for alternative, cost of bag will be more than the curd if a customer buys it in small quantity.”
 
 Grocery shop owner Mukesh said, “People from the lower strata of society who purchase goods in smaller quantity will be the worst hit because paper bags will not be cost-effective.”
