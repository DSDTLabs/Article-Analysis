ed:saju Coimbatore: S Rajasekaran, chairman and head of the department of orthopaedics at Ganga Hospital here received the prestigious Hari Om Ashram Alembic Research Award from the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee, at a function held in the Rashtrabathi Bhavan in New Delhi on Tuesday. Instituted by the Medical Council of India, the award is considered as a prestigious honour for those involved in medical research. It is given for an original research work done in India, which has a great impact in the practice of medicine. A statement from the Ganga Hospital said that the award was bestowed on Rajasekaran for his research in lumbar disc biology, probing into oxygen and nutritional transport into the disc. Reduction of nutritional pathways to the disc is considered to be the most important cause for low back pain, the most serious musculoskeletal disorder in the world, according to research. “Rajasekaran and his team also documented for the first time in world, the possibility to improve nutritional transport pharmacologically by the use of calcium channel blocking drugs. This has tremendous potential for improving the health and function of the disc and to reduce the incidence of back pain,’’ said the statement. This is the second time the doctor and his team are getting the award.
