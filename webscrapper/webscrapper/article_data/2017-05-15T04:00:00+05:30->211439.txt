Vadodara: State Consumer Redressal Commission has upheld decision of consumer court that ordered a city-based surgeon to pay Rs 2.65 lakh to a former employee of Food Corporation of India (FCI) as treatment cost, mental torture and legal costs. Ismail Delawala had approached Dr Kaushal Parikh at Muslim Medical Centre in Panigate in 2007 to treat severe cramps in his left leg. Parikh had initially given medicines to Delawala but when the pain persisted Parikh told him that the pain can be healed only after a surgery. However, Delawala was informed by Parikh that since the Muslim Medical Centre did not have enough facilities the operation can be done at his private hospital. Parikh after examining Delawala informed him that the surgery needs to be conducted on L4 and L5 lumbar nerve roots and the surgery was conducted in July 2007. But even after the surgery and taking the prescribed medicines Delawala’s cramps continued. Meanwhile, he approached another surgeon. “The other surgeon told me that the problem was in L3 lumbar nerve while the surgery was conducted on other lumbar nerves,” said Delawala. He had to undergo another surgery because of Parikh’s negligence. As Delawala’s medical costs rose due to second surgery, he moved consumer court through Jagrut Nagrik – a voluntary consumer association in September 2007 against Parikh. The consumer court, in October 2016, ordered Parikh to pay Rs 1.06 lakh along with 9% interest since he moved court, Rs 50,000 for mental torture and Rs 10,000 for legal costs.
