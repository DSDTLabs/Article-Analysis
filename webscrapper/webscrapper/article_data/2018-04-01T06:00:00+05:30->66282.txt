Kolkata: The future looks bright for Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers ( ) Ltd in Kolkata. After bagging orders for three stealth frigates under the Navy’s Project 17A, the defence shipyard is likely to build four survey vessels and eight anti-submarine warfare (ASW) shallow water craft for the Indian Navy. These two projects would be worth nearly Rs 8,000 crore.

 “We competed with other shipyards, as well as those in the private sector, and stood L1 in the bid for the survey vessels. The order is likely to be finalized by mid-2018. In the tender for the ASW shallow water craft, we were L2 while Cochin Shipyard was L1. As per this deal, the L1 firm is to get eight orders while the L2 shipyard will get orders for the remaining eight vessels. By the end of the 2018-19 financial year, we hope to have orders worth nearly Rs 8,000 crore from the Navy,” Rear Admiral (retd) V K Saxena, chairman and managing director, GRSE, told TOI on Friday.
 
 During the day, the shipyard launched the second of five fast patrol vessels (FPV) being built for the Coast Guard. 
 
 According to K S Sheoran, IG and commander, Coast Guard Region North East, these ships are part of a vital capacity building process that the force is undergoing. These ships have advanced weapons and sensors and are powered by three water-jet engines, he added.
 
 Lt Gen Krishna, GOC-in-C, Eastern Command, said that the latest ships being designed and built by GRSE are an encouraging development. GRSE also builds engineering equipment for the Army, including bailey bridges that are essential in mountainous terrain. According to Rear Admiral (retd) Saxena, GRSE has already built and supplied 5,100 portable bridges.
