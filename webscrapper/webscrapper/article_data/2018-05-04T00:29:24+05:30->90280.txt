Madurai: Madurai West MLA VV Rajan Chellapa inaugurated the desilting works at Sellur tank, a long pending demand of residents, in the presence of Madurai collector K Veera Raghava Rao and corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar on Thursday.

 In the first phase, the tank will be deepened for about one metre depth for one kilometre length and 30 metre breadth. Though Rs60 lakh has been sought for the process, work has begun even before the funds got sanctioned. District administration, public works department, civic body and public have helped to pitch in funds for the first phase. Officials said that 13 earth mover vehicles, eight trucks and seven tractors are being used for the works.
 
 Located on the northern banks of Vaigai River, Sellur tank was once spread over 94.75 acres. The sprawling tank used to cater to the irrigation of nearly 72 hectares of agricultural lands. It holds the excess water received from Sathayaru dam in the foothills of Sirumalai hills in Dindigul-Madurai border.
 
 An official said that it was a long demand of Sellur residents. The water in the tank helps to augment the underground water table and help the residents get water from borewells without any issue. 
 
 Due to silt deposit in the tank and poor storage of water level in the borewells, the residential settlements have come down over the years.
