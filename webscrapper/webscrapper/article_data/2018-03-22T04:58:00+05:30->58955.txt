Chennai: With pressure building up on his government to act against the offenders, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Tuesday said the government would take action against anyone, whosoever he/she may be, if they are found vandalizing statues of leaders. He condemned the incidence in Alangudi in Pudukottai and Tirupathur in Vellore district, in which three people, including a CRPF personnel, were arrested. 

 The stern warning followed after leader of opposition M K Stalin said the incidents would not have occurred had the state government taken against the national secretary of BJP, H Raja for his provocative tweet against Periyar. While moving a call attention motion to draw the attention of the House, the DMK leader recalled the statement of Raja about razing down the statues of Periyar, in the aftermath of statues of Lenin being pulled down in Tripura immediately after the assembly elections. “The country got to see widespread protests against Raja in Tamil Nadu. Raja should have been arrested,” Stalin said.
 
 Stalin reminded the House his earlier demand to the state to slap Goondas Act against the BJP leader. “Lack of action from the state led others gaining strength to damage the statues. The offenders, as well those who instigated them should be arrested,” he said, wondering why the government was not acting against those who disturb public peace, when those who protested against VHP’s Ram Rajiya Rath Yatra taking a route in Tamil Nadu. 
 
 Palaniswami said that both the incidents were condemnable. “Unbiased action will be taken against the offenders, whoever it may be or whatever rank he is,” the CM said, detailing the arrests made for both incidents. A CPRF cop, Senthil Kumar, who came home on vacation, had admitted during investigation that he destructed the statue. BJP town secretary Muthukumaran and Francis were arrested in Tirupathur on a complaint from DK functionaries.
