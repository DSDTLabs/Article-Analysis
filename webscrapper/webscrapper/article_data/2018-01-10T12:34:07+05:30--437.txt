KOLHAPUR: A trap camera fitted on a tree located in Kulewadi area of   in   taluka of   district was stolen between January 3 and January 6. The incident has been registered with Shahuwadi police station. 

 A police officer attached with Shahuwadi police station said, "We suspect that the motive behind stealing camera is not just monetary gain but to enter in forest area and carry out hunting."
 
 The trap camera along with the instruments used to fit it on the tree was worth Rs 21,000.
 
 According to police officials, the incident came to light on January 7 when the forest guard of the area   noticed that the camera was missing.
 
 The trap camera was set up to spot animals loitering in the forest and to keep a check on hunting in the forest area. The cameras record animal movements that can be useful to solve issues related to man-animal conflict.
 
 The officer said, "We have registered a case against unidentified persons under section 379 of IPC. The issue is serious as the culprits know where the trap cameras are installed in the forest."
 
 He added, "Usually the cameras are installed in such a way that they are not visible to people. However the cameras can spot animal movements. The theft suggests that some culprits know the placement of the cameras in detail."
