KOLKATA: Residents of 9 and 10 Old Court House Street may be allowed to return on Monday as   ( ) needs to keep the building under observation for 30-36 hours after the TBM has trudged past.

 Tunnel boring machine (TBM) Rachna, which is digging the east-bound tunnel of the   link, surpassed 9 and 10 Old Court House Street “safely” late on Friday evening.
 
 Aafter Rachna moved past the two ramshackle buildings, KMRC general manager (administration) A K   informed the occupants (26 residents and 14 shopkeepers) that they can return to their premises on Monday.
  
  
 A KMRC source said, “No notice will be served for the return. The occupants have been verbally told that they can come back to 9 and 10 Old Court House Street.”
 
 Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) engineers said residents would return “at their own risk” since the buildings have been declared “dangerous” and “condemned” by the civic authorities. “Hats off to KMRC and construction company Afcons for the way they strengthened the buildings. However, those who want to use such structures, must do it at their own risk,” a KMC engineer said.
 
 Clearly, KMRC is steering clear of the non-inhabitability issue and strictly focusing on taking the TBMs ahead. Sources in the agency said crossing each of the seven “extremely critical condition” buildings identified at Dalhousie is like surpassing milestones. “We are bracing for more such buildings. The condition of 5 Old Court House Street, which was declared “condemned” by KMC ages ago, is most scary. We are keeping our fingers crossed,” a source said.
 
 The residents are, however, relieved that they can return to their premises at last.  , a paan seller, said, “It was nice living in the hotel.But it’s time to go home now.” On Thursday, Nandy asked the residents to wait outside as they inspected the condition of the buildings. The evacuees, 26 of whom have been put up in a central Kolkata hotel by KMRC, were initially supposed to return on January 19.
