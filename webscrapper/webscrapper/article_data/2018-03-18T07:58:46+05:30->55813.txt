BHOPAL: A Class XII student hanged herself at home in  , leaving behind a note to her mother in which she apologized for not being able to memorize lessons.

 The victim, Meryl, thought she hadn’t done well in her physics paper in the ongoing board exams. She studied in a private school in Karmveer Nagar. This is the fourth exam-related suicide in the state this month, and the second in the city in a week.
 
 In her last letter to her mother, she wrote: “My efforts to memorize lessons go to waste. I cannot remember the topics I studied. Forgive me mother.” 
 
 Meryl was with her maternal grandmother at their house in   on Friday morning, with her brother giving his Class X board exams, father RD Swami in his factory and her mother out on work. She told her grandma that a neighbour was calling her. When she left, Meryl fashioned a noose out of her dupatta and hanged herself. Her grandma returned a little later to find her hanging. Her brother returned, too, and together they called police. Cops found the letter, written with English alphabets for Hindi, in which she said she was killing herself because she hadn’t done well in physics, said investigation officer ASI Umesh Mishra.
 
 A case was registered at Piplani police station. Her father told police that Meryl was depressed after returning from her physics exam on March 14. She said she hadn’t done well. Her parents counselled her to forget it and prepare for next paper, biology, but she couldn’t concentrate on studies, said Swami.
 
 On March 12, Class XII student   had committed suicide because he had been able to attempt only 55% questions in his English paper. He had scored 85% in Class X.
