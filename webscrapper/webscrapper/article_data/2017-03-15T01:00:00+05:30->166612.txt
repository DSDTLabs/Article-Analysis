Hardy Sandhu, who was the star performer at  's annual cultural festival, ' ', on the last day, began his performance fashionably late. Hardy not only sang his own Punjabi songs like ' ' and 'Backbone', he also sang some Hindi hit numbers like 'Channa Mereya', 'Kabira', and also Euphoria's 'Maaeri' with a Punjabi twist. Before singing 'Maaeri', he said, "Wherever I go, I tell people, 'Meri girlfriend mujhe chhod ke chali gayi,' aur phir yeh gaana gaata hoon."

  The singer was overwhelmed to see the response of the crowd. He asked them, "Aap sab theek ho na? Maza aa raha hai na?" and also danced with the crowd.
 
 
 The sports ground of the college was almost packed. Though he started his performance quite late, the students had no complaints. Manisha Yadav, a third-year student, told us, "I like him so much. We came here around 1pm and the performance started at 4pm, but his performance was worth the wait." Laxmi Mathur, another third-year student, added, "Kabhi kabhi toh dekh paate hain inn logon ko. Toh thoda wait karne se fark nahin padta."
