HYDERABAD: A software engineer has been arrested for secretly recording intimate moments with his wife and streaming them live on a   using his laptop. The engineer, who was arrested last week, has been sent to judicial custody.

 
 
 
 The victim (28), who is also employed, lodged a complaint with the   police in November 2016 after one of her friends informed her about the video on a porn site. At that time, she did not suspect that it was her husband who was behind the crime.
 
 Investigations led cops to a man in Thrissur, who confessed that he had recorded the visuals from a live streaming porn site and uploaded them on another porn site. Upon analyzing the video and talking to the victim, cops concluded that the video was recorded in the couple’s bedroom using a laptop camera.
 
 The couple was watching a movie on the husband’s laptop but the wife didn’t realize that simultaneously their video was being recorded using the laptop camera, police said.
 
 
 
 
 “He played a film on the laptop at the same time to conceal the fact that the web cam was on. Also, he wanted his wife to look at the monitor so that the viewers watching the live stream would see her properly,” a police officer said. The husband was detained and his laptop and cell phone seized 10 days ago.
 
 “The analysis of the laptop provided us information that he had been visiting a lot of porn websites. He also has accounts on porn streaming sites and escort service sites,” ACP, Cyber Crime, S Jayaram told TOI.
 
 The husband confessed to his crime after interrogation. Police have also gathered technical evidence to prove that the video was live streamed from the accused’s laptop. Police have already got the videos removed from the porn site.
