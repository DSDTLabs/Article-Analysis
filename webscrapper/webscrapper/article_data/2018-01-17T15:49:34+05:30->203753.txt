Bollywood actress,   was honoured with her first National Award at the 64th edition of National Film Awards. She received the 'Special Mention Award' for her brave act in ‘Neerja’ movie. She was accompanied by her family members and her good friend Anand Ahuja for this prestigious event in Delhi. 

 She received the award by President Pranab Mukherjee, making it one of her biggest moments in the film industry. And for this special occasion, Sonam kept it regal in a green sari by Anamika Khanna. She decked up the look with beautiful kundan jewellery and neatly tied hair. She also decorated her bun with gajra, giving it a traditional touch. We trust her to make a fashion statement every time. And this impressive styling of Sonam just reminds us the power of sari yet again!
