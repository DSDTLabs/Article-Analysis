PATNA: In a swift reaction to the row over withdrawal of 17 security personnel from Rabri Devi’s 10, Circular Road bungalow on Tuesday, chief minister   on Thursday ordered restoration of the pre-Tuesday security cover at the former CM’s official residence.

 Nitish took cognizance of Rabri’s letter of protest to him against the state police HQ’s move soon after his return from poll-bound Karnataka on Thursday. The chief minister has also sought an explanation from the officials concerned as to who decided to downgrade the security allotted to the two former CMs for their lifetime, and why.
 
 While 10, Circular Road has been allotted to Rabri in her capacity as a former CM, another former CM and her husband   also resides in it. Their two sons — MLAs Tej Pratap and   — live with them. Lalu is currently away in judicial custody after his conviction in fodder scam cases by a   court in Ranchi in December last year.
 
 Of the 123 bodyguards and house guards deployed at the bungalow, 17 Bihar   personnel were withdrawn by the state police HQ on the ground that they had been allotted for the security of Lalu who no longer lived on the premises.
