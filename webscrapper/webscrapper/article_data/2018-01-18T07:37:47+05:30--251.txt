CHENNAI: Actor   has said that he would be ready to contest the   assembly election even if it was held six months from now. He also wished success to fellow actor and long-time friend   on his plans to launch a political party.

 “We will be ready,” Rajinikanth told reporters outside his residence on Wednesday, when asked about whether he and his yet-to-belaunched party will be ready to face elections if they were held in the next few months. On Kamal Haasan’s plan for a state-wide tour from February 21after naming his party, Rajinikanth wished him success but remained non-committal on whether the two actors, who are taking the political plunge around the same time, will work together. “Only time can tell,” Rajinikanth said, when asked whether the political parties of the two actors would work together.
 
 
 It may be recalled that actor Kamal Haasan, on Tuesday night, revealed his plans to undertake a state-wide tour from February 21, to understand people’s problems and issues affecting them, starting it from his birthplace Ramanathapuram in south Tamil Nadu. In the first phase of the tour, he will also cover and interact with people in Madurai, Dindigul and   districts.
 
 “At the commencement of the journey, I intend to announce the name of my political party along with the guiding principles we intend to live by,” Kamal Haasan had said in the statement. “Finally, let’s question mediocrity and raise the bar on governance and welfare for the people of Tamil Nadu. This journey is intended towards that goal,” he added.
 
 “Rajinikanth is for spiritual politics. Mine will be rationalist politics,” actor Kamal Haasan told reporters late on Wednesday evening, after participating in a film function in Chennai.
