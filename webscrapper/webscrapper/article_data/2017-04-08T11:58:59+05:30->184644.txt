PATNA: The Patna police on Friday arrested   alias Sonu (30) for allegedly demanding extortion money from a railway contractor.

 Sources said the arrested criminal told police he was operating at jailed legislator Ritlal Yadav’s behest. He was arrested from Ranjan Path under the Rupaspur police station area.
 
 Railway contractor   (47), a native of Jamalpur in Munger district, lodged an FIR in the Khagaul police station on Wednesday, alleging that he got a call on his cellphone and the caller demanded Rs 20 lakh from him.
 
 Khagaul police station SHO   said the FIR named three accused, including MLC   and Sonu. “Sonu made the call, and asked the contractor to contact Ritlal for making the payment,” the SHO said and added Sonu also thrashed the contractor in Khagaul.
 
 “We are examining the call detail records of the cellphone number which was used to threaten the contractor,” the SHO said.
 
 Patna SSP   said Sonu at the MLC’s behest collected extortion money from two other contractors in the past. Contractor Prasad got the call from Sonu soon after getting a railway contract worth around Rs 1.8 crore, the SSP said, adding Ritlal would be taken on police remand for interrogation.
