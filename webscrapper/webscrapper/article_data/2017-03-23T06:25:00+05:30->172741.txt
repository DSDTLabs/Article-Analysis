 The six malls include JD Hi Street Mall, SRS Tower, Galaxia Mall, Nucleus Mall, Spring City Mall and Eyelex Mall.
 
 Sharma said, “For now, we have given them a warning. If they don’t follow the directions we will send a letter again. If they flout the norms for the third time we will explore provision to impose fine.” Sources in the RMC said that the amount of fine can go up to Rs 25,000 for each mall. The civic body is also preparing a list of such places which offer paid parking.
 
 “We will check the fees collected at all the private parking spots and send notices to those who do not follow the norms,” Sharma added.
