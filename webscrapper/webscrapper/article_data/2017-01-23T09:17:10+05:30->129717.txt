GUWAHATI: The   (PVM), an anti-influx body headed by   advocate Upamanyu Hazarika, is going to lodge complaints with the police against the state government and several of its officials for "aiding infiltrators" to settle in 77,420 bighas of land in Darrang district's Sipajhar. 

 Hazarika, who had also headed an apex court commission studying   into Assam, said, "For the past three years, the indigenous people of Sipajhar have been relentlessly demanding that their land be freed of encroachers, suspected to be illegal migrants. Rather than evicting them, the government has provided benefits to them, which is in flagrant violation of the law. It is nothing but a continued breach of laws."
 
 "Of the land under encroachment, only 1,200 bighas was cleared in the name of eviction. A total of some 3,000 bighas of the encroached land falls under Professional Grazing Reserves, which, under the Assam Revenue Regulation, can only be used for grazing," he added.
 
 The move came after the state government failed to evict the encroachers despite it announced it would do so within January 21 this year. The PVM is going to observe a   on January 28 to press for immediate eviction.
