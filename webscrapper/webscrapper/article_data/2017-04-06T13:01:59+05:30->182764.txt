PANAJI:   beach would become Goa’s first wheelchair accessible beach with the installation of a permanent wooden ramp starting from the main beach right up to the waves. Deputy speaker and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo announced on Wednesday that wheelchair accessibility and other amenities for the disabled would be completed within the next two months. 

 This ramps would be replicated at the beaches of Calangute, Baga, near Titos and Sinquerim, before it is taken to other beaches in the state, Lobo told reporters on the sidelines of BeachFest2017, a festival to celebrate beach accessibility, organized an online travel platform for persons with disabilities named Umoja. 
 
 Around 15,000sqm of the tourism department’s land on Candolim beach would be developed to accommodate changing rooms, bathrooms and a parking area where a portion would be reserved for persons with disabilities including the elderly, Lobo said.
 
 Lobo said that ramps will be fitted on other beaches by October this year. 
 
 “I feel the tourism department should take it up as a priority,” Lobo said. He added that he would take the help of government departments for making the bathrooms accessible and disabled-friendly, but other costs would be borne by hoteliers as part of their corporate social responsibility activities. Lobo has not only ramps, but also wheelchairs at these beaches with people to assist the disabled.
