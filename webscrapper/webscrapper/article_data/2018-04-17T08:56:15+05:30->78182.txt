Bhubaneswar:   coach   is still living a nightmare. He was assistant to   last May, when   stunned an in-form Mohun Bagan 2-0 to lift the   in Cuttack.

 As Sen lambasted some of his “over-rated players” at the media conference, an emotionally-broken Chakraborty could not sit in the dressing room as the noise of celebrations from the adjacent room was too “torturing” to tolerate.
 
 “I will never forget that match. Our team was one of the best at that time and still we lost. It was unbearable,” Chakraborty reminisced on Monday.
 
 Chakraborty and his team will have the chance to heal that wound when the two teams face off on Tuesday in the second   semifinal at the Kalinga Stadium, barely a 40-minute drive from Cuttack’s Barabati Stadium.
 
 During his pre-match news conference, BFC coach Albert Roca talked about Bagan’s emergence as “a team” in the post-Sony Norde days. “Bagan have a few new players, they have a good balance and they have a lot of character. It’s going to be a good test for my players,” the Spaniard pointed out.
