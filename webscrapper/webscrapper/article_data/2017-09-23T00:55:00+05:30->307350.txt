Coimbatore: People in Coimbatore corporation limits will get water supply once in five days. S P Velumani, minister for municipal admisnitration, who held a review meeting at the collector’s office on Friday to take stock of the city’s drinking water supply, said the district recorded 6.8% excess rainfall from January to September, which resulted in all the dams filling up. 

 The expected rainfall was 369mm, but 394mm was received. “We will draw 80MLD from the Siruvani dam instead of the current 40 MLD that will increase water supply in wards that get Siruvani water. And the 25MLD that was drawn from the Pillur I scheme will be stopped so that areas that got water supply from that scheme will get increased supply,” said the minister. 
 
 He said areas such as Kurichi and Kuniyamuthur will draw 9 MLD from the Aliyar water-supply scheme and 11 MLD from the Vadavalli-Veerakeralam drinking water scheme.
