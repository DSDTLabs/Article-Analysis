KOCHI: As tourist season peaks in Kerala's popular hill station Munnar, visitors are playing a dangerous game of getting down from their vehicles not only to have a close look at elephants but also to take selfies. 

 
  
  
 
 On Wednesday, a lone wild tusker - who locals lovingly call   - stood on the Munnar-Marayoor road helplessly, sometimes even charging at tourists who yelled, rode their bikes and took selfies.
 
  
  
 
 
 Project Elephant member   said that tourists should know how to behave in the wilderness and keep a safe distance from the elephants. 
  
  
 
 
 
 "They should not drive towards the elephant nor switch on the lights or blow the vehicle horns. They should wait for the elephant to move out," he said.
