 Prannoy said that he played well and made it tough for his rival. "I played really well today to make it tough for Wang. I did well in the first game also but a couple of errors cost me that game. But I did not get tense and was patient enough to win the next two," said Prannoy, who will face former world No.1 Wan Ho Son of South Korea in the quarterfinals on Friday. Son enjoys a 3-1 win-loss record against Prannoy but the Indian won their last meeting in Denmark last October.
