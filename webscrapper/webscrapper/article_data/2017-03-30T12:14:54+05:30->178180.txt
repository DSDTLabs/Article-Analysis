  : The staff nurses of the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital (GMKMCH) here staged a protest in front of the hospital on Wednesday, demanding protection for them during working hours. 

 The move comes after the video of a staff nurse refusing to attend to a patient, citing work overload went viral on WhatsApp and Facebook. Following this, hospital dean   had ordered a departmental inquiry into the incident.
 
 There were also allegations of nurses and other hospital staff, who allegedly sought 1,000 from the kin of a pregnant woman but got only 300, abusing the lady admitted to the labour ward. 
 
 In the first incident, a painter identified as Chandran, of Shevapet, fell from atop a building in   in   and he was admitted to the Salem government hospital on Saturday early morning. Since the patient wasn't accompanied by any kin at the time of the admission, he was put in the septic ward. When his relatives reached the hospital on Sunday late night, they found him unconscious and not aware that he had already succumbed to his injuries asked a duty nurse to examine him.
 
 The nurse, however, refused to attend to the patient saying that she can't take care of each patient as she had to take care of eight wards at night. The kin of the deceased recorded the whole episode using a mobile phone and shared it on WhatsApp and Face Book. The video went viral and hospital dean Dr Kanagaraj ordered a departmental inquiry after he saw the video.
 
 On Wednesday, the nurses staged a protest in front of the dean's building. Talking to reporters, president of   said the Salem government hospital nurses were often harassed by the visitors and the attenders. "There are many vacancies for nurses, but as authorities haven't taken any step to fill them one is forced to take care of many wards at a time," she said.
 
 The protest lasted for only a few minutes as they returned to their duty.
