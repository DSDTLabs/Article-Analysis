GAYA: The confusion on account of the ongoing   bifurcation exercise was worse confounded following a government notification issued with retrospective effect. 

 The state government on April 9, 2018 issued a gazette notification transferring the administrative and academic control of all MU colleges, located in Patna and   districts to the newly-created  , with Patna as its headquarters. The notification was made retrospectively effective from March 18, 2018. 
 
 The notification issued by additional secretary, education department,   also said that assets and liabilities of these colleges are also automatically transferred to Pataliputra University.
 
 According to legal experts, as per the contents of the gazette notification, all decisions taken by the MU VC between March 18 and April 1, with regard to colleges and employees located in Patna and Nalanda districts automatically gets nullified.
 
 A plain reading of the notification also means that nearly 2,000 teachers and non- teaching employees of 25 constituent and three government-funded minority colleges of the undivided MU will get their March salary in two instalments. As these employees ceased to be on the pay roll of MU on March 18, the parent university will be liable to pay the remuneration for March 1 to 17 and remuneration for the remaining days of the month will be paid by the new varsity.
 
 MU VC Prof Qamar Ahsan said he cannot say anything categorically and the committee constituted to formalise the bifurcation modalities will take care.
 
 According to former director of higher education  , “Pataliputra University, for all practical purposes came into existence, the day its VC assumed charge. Apportionment of employees and distribution of assets and liabilities was an administrative issue and a pragmatic approach was needed in ironing out the problems.”
