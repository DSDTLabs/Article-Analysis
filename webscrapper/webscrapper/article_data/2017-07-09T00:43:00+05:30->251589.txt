Udupi: Welcoming the decision of   Vishwesha Teertha Swami to hold an iftar at Krishna Mutt premises, AICC general secretary and in-charge of Karnataka K C Venugopal said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should learn from the seer about maintaining   in society. 

 “Pejawar seer has set a best example for maintaining peace and harmony in society by hosting an iftar meet. Modi should learn from him as he has not hosted a single iftar in the last three years. Even former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee used to host an iftaar. In a democratic set up such things do matter,’’ he said. 
 
 When his attention was drawn towards the statement of Pejawar seer where he likened the demolition of Babri Masjid to India’s Independence, the Congress leader said he would not question the seer’s belief. 
 
 Commenting on BC Road issue, he said that the law and order situation in Karnataka has always been peaceful. However, whenever elections approach, a section of society try to create communal disturbances intending to polarise voters, he added.
 
 To a question, he said the party will field new faces in 2018 assembly elections, if required. “ Congress will face the election with the agenda of development and social responsibility which the Siddaramaiah government is following for the last four years,” he added.
