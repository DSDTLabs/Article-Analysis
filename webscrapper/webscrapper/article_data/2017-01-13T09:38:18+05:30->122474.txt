AMRITSAR: A horrendous face of modern day  , which even death can’t defy, has come to light.

 Body of 25-year-old   is lying in a morgue of a Riyadh hospital for the past three months after his employer refused to pay hospital bills. As a result the hospital has withheld the body forcing Amritpal’s family in India to knock every door seeking help in bringing back the body. 
 
 Amritpal’s hapless father   told TOI on Wednesday that his son was hit by a speeding car driven by a Saudi national while he was crossing the road on October 5, 2016. However, after 7 days of treatment, his condition didn’t improve and he died on October 10.
 
 A graduate, Amritpal Singh worked in a private bank in Amritsar before taking up a job in a transport company in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
 
 Parminder said his son had all the necessary medical insurance coverage in place and his salary was due to the company he worked for but his employer refused to pay hospital bill of nearly 39,000 Riyal following which the hospital refused to release Amritpal’s body.
 
 Stating that Amritpal’s one-year-old son and wife had dark future, Parminder said he had also approached foreign minister Sushma Swaraj’s office urging them to help bring back his son’s body and adequate compensation so his family could survive. “We are going to Delhi to meet the minister,” he said. 
 
 NGO Justice Upheld’s  , who has taken up Amritpal’s case at various government levels, said she had investigated and found that the deceased was a victim of prevailing ‘Kafla’ system, a form of bonded labour operating in the Gulf state. She said ‘Kafla’ system allowed nationals of the Gulf States to employ non Gulf nationals and also enables the exploitation of foreign migrant workers as well as encouraging and facilitating forced labour.
 
 Uppal said “It is sad that the parents of Amritpal Singh have been forced to plead with the Indian and the Saudi authorities for over three months for the repatriation of his body.
