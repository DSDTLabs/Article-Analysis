Ahmedabad: A city sessions court on Thursday sent an accused in the controversial bitcoin extortion case, Kirit Paladiya, to further police remand for two days.

 CID crime had sought eight daysâ€™ remand for Paladiya after his six-day custodial interrogation was over.
 
 Public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt submitted that Paladiya was the main conspirator in this case and was the business partner of complainant Shailesh Bhatt. His questioning revealed that an amount of $10.95 lakh was in his Binance exchange in 119 bitcoins.
 
 The prosecutor also claimed that Paladiya had launched Nexa Coin and had begun dealing in Nexa coins. Since he was in the know of the passwords of digital wallets from where the bitcoins had been transferred at the behest of Amreli police, his custodial interrogation was required for eight more days.
 
 After hearing the submissions, the court granted two more days of custodial interrogation.
