Not only is it halal, waterproof and long lasting, it is also  . To get a natural looking reddish stain, just make a paste of   by mixing dried, ground leaves with water, lemon juice or strong tea and apply the paste on the lips cleanly and evenly as this will   based on how it is applied. Leave it on for half an hour or until you have got the desired colour and then scrape or wash it off. 

 This stain will last for about three days as the skin on the lips is thin and renews quickly. One word of caution, if you are sensitive to strong smells, then steer clear of this one. Also, henna is known to dry the skin, so apply   balm at regular intervals. 
 
 PS: Henna stains are your best bet if you are going for a outing to the waterpark, where you cannot apply makeup.
