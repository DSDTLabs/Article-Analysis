GURUGRAM: A   was found beheaded in Kiranj village on Friday, 30km from the city on Sohna-Palwal road, a day after there were reports of a   being shot on Thursday evening at the same village.

 The villagers have sent a written complaint to the   wildlife department (a copy is with TOI). “I found a   peacock in my farmland. I also noticed a suspicious person nearby, who I think was the killer,” states the complaint. 
 
 Jai Prakash Shastri, a complainant, told TOI, “A nilgai was shot in Kiranj a day earlier. Increase in wildlife crimes is concerning. Peacocks are killed mainly for meat.” A wildlife department source differed, saying, “Peacocks shed their plumage towards summer-end, but it’s difficult to gather these, so they are killed. However, in this case, it might have been attacked by another animal.”
 
 Amit Chaudhery, president of People for Animals (PFA)  , agreed, saying, “Killings of peacocks often go unnoticed. Even in this case, despite a complaint getting lodged, no action has been taken yet.”
