  NPS charts the journey of an angry young soldier from the Army, Surya, played by Allu Arjun. When his behavioural issues land him in trouble with his higher-ups, he must prove himself a changed man to be allowed into the army again, if only to make him dream at serving at the Border come true. Does he manage to achieve this dream or will he let his weakness come in the way of his dreams forms the crux of the story.
 
  The film saw Allu Arjun give in his heart and soul not just for his performance, but also behind-the-scenes wherein he came up with his character’s look for the film. The filmmakers also released a video showing Allu Arjun worked hard for 2 whole months to get the hat tricks he performs in the song ‘Lover Also Fighter Also’ right. Despite his hard work, poor direction and screenplay turned out to be the film’s bane. 
 
  It remains to be seen how the film will fare in the coming days.
