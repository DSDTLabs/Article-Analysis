Though finance minister Arun Jaitley said yoga would be extended to all policemen to ensure they are fit, no allocation has been made.

 In the 2015-16 Budget, the government had allocated Rs 4 crore towards yoga programmes. Besides, the government had decided to accord special status to yoga by categorising its promotion as a charitable activity in the previous Budget.
 
 Although there has been no allocation in yoga for policemen, Tamil Nadu has always been a pioneer in conducting yoga programmes not only for policemen but also prisoners. Yoga teachers conducted sessions for more than 10,000 policemen in each session.
