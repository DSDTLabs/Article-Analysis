PUNE:   outside housing societies and bungalows across the city pose a major hurdle for free  . Citizens also use footpaths and open spaces around their houses to park vehicles. 

 On Wednesday afternoon, a major traffic snarl was witnessed in Taware colony area, off Satara Road, after traffic signals at the junction nearby stopped working abruptly. 
 
 However, bungalow owners along the road, near  , who had parked their vehicles on the road, didn't bother to move their vehicles to ease the traffic flow. Residents here continue to park their vehicles on the road 24x7, undeterred by the regular traffic jams and the resultant chaos.
 
 "The civic body and the traffic department continue to ignore violation of rules. Roads are being converted into parking lots by housing societies and nobody is holding them responsible for the illegal activity," said Sudarshan Kanta, who regularly commutes by bus.
 
 However, society residents have a different stand on the issue. Suhas Patwardhan, chairman, Pune district co-operative housing federation, said, "Housing society members have no option but to park their vehicles on roads. Parking space in societies is limited and the number of vehicles per household is increasing. The   or traffic department cannot impose fine on vehicle owners as people have to use private vehicles in the absence of efficient public transport."
 
 A senior   official said pressure is building on the civic body to increase parking spaces in housing societies and public places. "Politicians continue to insist on increasing parking plots, but we cannot go on adding more plots," he added.
