 Pankaj Kumar, principal secretary, revenue, informed on his Twitter handle that 45 were shifted near Deesa after Sherpura and Pechdal ponds overflowed. Also, five more rain-related deaths were reported across the state. Approach roads to 10 villages in Amigadh were affected due to flow of water on the causeway.
