SASARAM: Three named FIRs have been lodged with the Model police station ,   against   chairperson   Devi and three others for making three contractors captive in her official chamber on Tuesday . 
 
 Sources said the contractors had come to deposit hard copies of the documents related to bidding process for putting up dustbins and mobile toilets. Model police station SHO Md. Irashad confirmed the incident and said stern action would be taken against the accused. 
  
 “The accused allegedly deprived the contractors from depositing the hard copies on scheduled time (3 pm) on Tuesday by holding them hostage. Possibility of involvement of the Nagar Parishad employees in the incident cannot be denied as the   camera of the Parishad was found to be non-functional,” said the SHO. 
  
 Kanchan however denied the charges saying she had not gone to her office on Tuesday. Sources said that three contractors—Ritesh Ranjan from Patna and Sudama Pandey and Raju Kumar from Kaimur district had gone to submit their documents for the bidding process. The executive officer had asked them to hand over the documents to a clerk, but when they reached there, the chairperson and three others assaulted them and snatched their documents and they were locked up in the chairperson’s chamber.
