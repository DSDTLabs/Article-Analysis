NAGPUR:   forest officer ( ) was caught red-handed by sleuths of   ( ) while accepting bribe of Rs 3 lakh at a hotel in Dharampeth on Wednesday.

 A branch engineer of city forest department too was nabbed an hour later from Zero Mile Square as he accepted a bribe of Rs20,000. The duo had demanded money from a contractor to clear his bills of Rs11.46 lakh for construction of a bridge.
 
 The accused, identified as RFO Ashok Makde (54) and Anil Padole were booked and arrested under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The duo was immediately suspended from the department. They would be produced before the court on Thursday.
 
 Cops carried out searches at Makde’s place in Sant Gadge Nagar on Hingna Road and recovered Rs12.35lakh and 25 gram of gold. Makde’s father Kashiram, retired from SRPF, claimed they had collected the cash to buy farm land but could not show any documents to support his claims.
 
 This is the second time Makde has been suspended from the department. In December 2013, he was suspended from the post of RFO at Hingni in Wardha in the plantation scam running into lakhs, though he managed to get a lucrative post in the department later.
 
 The complainant had legally got the sub-contract of road construction in 2016 and completed four bridges, following which he raised bills of Rs11.46lakh. He approached Makde for clearing his bills. But complainant was asked to pay 30% of the bills as bribe. Later, he went to take the bills of construction measurements, which would help clear his claims. But there he was told to give Rs20,000.
 
 As the contractor was not willing to fulfil illegal demand, he approached ACB department and lodged a complaint. The concerned team verified Makde’s demand on March 9 and Padole’s demand on March 7. Accordingly, ACB sleuths laid a trap to catch the duo red-handed. Cops nabbed the duo after they accepted the bribe amount at different places from the contractor. Offences have been registered at Sitabuldi police station.
