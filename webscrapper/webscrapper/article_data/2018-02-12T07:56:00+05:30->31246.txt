Dharamshala: The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) reacted to the murder of a 20-year-old woman in Kangra by staging a protest on Sunday and saying that people had lost faith in “government machinery”, especially after the gangrape and murder of a schoolgirl in Shimla last year.

 The ABVP happens to be the student wing of the RSS, whose political wing, the BJP, is in power in the state. Members of the ABVP protested at the main square of Dharamshala over the murder, while the Congress and none of its affiliates organised any kind of protest. 
 
 The ABVP’s protest has come at a time when chief minister Jai Ram Thakur is facing protests in his home district over the shiftingf of the office of Seraj sub-divisional magistrate (SDM). ANVP state joint secretary Rahul Rana said were perturbed by incidents of rape and murder in a “peaceful” state like Himachal Pradesh. “People have lost faith in government machinery. We need to questiuon why such incidents are taking place,” he said.
 
 When asked why were they protesting against their own government, the ABVP leadeer said they were protesting for the state’s welfare, not over politics.
 
 ABVP’s convener for Kangra, Nishu Thakur, said they just wanted justice. “The accused in Shimla rape and murder case are still free, while they should be behind bars. And now this killing,” she said.
 
 Later, they were briefed by the police about the details of the case. Congress leaders Kewal Singh Pathania and Sudhir Sharma said the tragedy was unfortunate and the police should ensure justice for the woman’s family.
