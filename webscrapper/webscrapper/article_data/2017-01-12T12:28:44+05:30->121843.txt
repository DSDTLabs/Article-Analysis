PATNA: Differences surfaced within the   on Wednesday as former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s   (HAM) decided to stay away from the human chain to be formed in Bihar on  .

 Manjhi’s decision has come as a surprise to many as HAM is a constituent of the NDA and its main partner BJP has already extended support to the state government’s initiative.
 
 “The NDA (BJP, HAM, LJP and RLSP) had in one voice described the Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 as draconian as it contained stringent provisions like arrest of family members on recovery of liquor from a house. The Act has not been amended and, therefore, supporting the human chain initiative is not correct,” Manjhi said.
 
 The former CM recalled the NDA leaders also voiced protest against the stringent provisions in the Act at an all-party meeting on prohibition late last year and took out a protest march to the   after boycotting the assembly. “If at all the NDA wishes to join the human chain, it should first express regret for describing the Act as draconian and Talibani,” he said.
 
 Manjhi also feared Nitish would use the NDA’s participation in the human chain to justify the stringent provisions of the Act.
 
 Visibly upset over the BJP’s sudden decision, Manjhi said it was a a unilateral decision of the BJP. “All allies should have been consulted and taken into confidence before arriving at such a decision,” he said.
