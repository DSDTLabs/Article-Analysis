NEW DELHI:   leader   facing   case from finance minister   on Monday argued in Delhi high court that Jaitley is a politician and should be open to “close scrutiny” and should “tolerate fair criticism.”

 Chadha defended his utterances against Jaitley, submitting in his plea that he didn’t say anything to defame the senior BJP leader. He claimed that the defamation action by Jaitley is a “threat” and continues to be “a fetter on free speech” on a topic which is clearly in public interest.
 
 In an application, Chadha sought to add certain preliminary objections to his written statements that he had filed earlier in response to the suit, even as Jaitley’s lawyers have maintained that AAP leaders including chief minister   are adopting delaying tactics.
 
 On Monday, Chandha’s counsel sought adjournment before Justice Deepa Sharma on the ground that the lead counsel, who would argue the matter, was not available.
 
 Senior advocate Pratibha M Singh and advocate  , representing Jaitley, told the court that trial proceedings in the matter were going on before the Joint Registrar and the finance minister had tendered his evidence in support of his suit. HC then fixed the matter for May 11.
