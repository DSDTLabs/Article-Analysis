BHOPAL: Availability of cash may not be a problem in cities, but in some areas in  , the situation is far from satisfactory. A large number of ATMs — both private and nationalised banks— are reportedly running dry in Sagar, Damoh, Chhatarpur and   districts for past three to seven days days.

 “We have become a cashless system as there is no cash,” said   jokingly. He is a guide in Khajuraho, the international tourist destination, where all six ATMs did not have cash for past one week. SBI ATM near Western group of temples complex has no money. “ATMs are a lifeline in this age,” Tripathi said, adding Khajuraho is a tourist destination where people from across the world come to visit the site. The banks must ensure ATMs run smoothly,” said Tripathi.
 
 In Sagar, divisional headquarters of Bundelkhand for the state, 125 out of 140 ATMs ran out of cash for three days. “After April 2 violence, many people have started keeping enough cash at home. ATMs are running almost dry on a regular basis,” said  , a local trader.
 
 Vinay Jain, another trader said, “The business is affected as ATMs don’t have money and the swipe machines don’t work properly. This is happening irrespective of the fact whether it is a public or a private sector bank.” On Saturday, ATMs were not functioning at Katra, Civil Lines, Gopalganj , Sadar and Makronia among other places in Sagar city. Similar situation prevailed in the rural areas of the district.
 
 In neighbouring Chhatarpur, Damoh and Tikamgarh, residents face problems in the absence of cash in ATMs. Talk to bank officials in  , and they refuse to come on record to tell what has gone wrong. Sources in SBI, pleading anonymity, said, “ ATMs are not filled because there is not enough cash. Many bank branches in rural area are not getting enough cash, which can be used to refill ATMs.” “It appears people are not depositing cash, which is leading to a crisis of sorts,” he said.
