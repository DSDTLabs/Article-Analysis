KOLKATA: The western world loves to believe that all universities the world over are modelled on the European education system, but that doesn’t apply to Asia, and definitely not to India, which has always been the doyen of ancient education, said renowned historian  . He was delivering a lecture on cultural transfers in history at the bicentenary celebrations of   on Friday. 

 According to Gungwu, the   and its resultant impact on education remain examples for the whole world even today. “Hindoo College had started in 1817. Singapore was not more than a swamp at that time. So you can imagine how the rest of the Asian world looked up to you for  ,” Gungwu stressed. 
 
 In his speech, the Australian historian of overseas Chinese descent also referred to Buddhist monks to stress on India’s contribution to education. “Trained in the sutras, they travelled to China with rare knowledge that they peacefully spread. People of China were so impressed with these teachings that they accepted Buddhism. This is the kind of non-aggressive dissemination of knowledge that India is capable of, something that the West cannot imagine,” Gungwu said.
 
 When asked whether complete autonomy was possible, Gungwu replied in the negative. “The source of existence of universities lies in state funding. Despite their best efforts, even universities in Europe and the US have not been able to achieve complete freedom from state control,” he explained.
