CHENNAI: A public interest litigation has been filed in the Madras high court in a last ditch effort to foil AIADMK legislature party leader Edappadi K Palaniswami from being sworn in as   chief minister.

 After the party’s interim general secretary was convicted by the Supreme Court in a disproportionate assets case on February 14, leading her to her surrender on Wednesday, AIADMK legislators have chosen Palaniswami as their leader and a letter of support and with formal request to be invited to form the government has been handed over to Tamil Nadu governor Vidyasagar Rao.
 
 This   was mentioned as an urgent matter by advocate N Jothi, who was long-time personal advocate of deceased chief minister Jayalalithaa. After doing a stint as member of the Rajya Sabha on behalf of the AIADMK, Jothi had joined the DMK.
 
 On Thursday, Jothi mentioned the matter before a division bench of Justice Huluvadi Ramesh and Justice Anitha Sumath, which permitted him to bring the case up for hearing at 2.15pm. The PIL cites state as well as central government authorities, besides the Governor’s secretariat as respondents.
 
 Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao on Thursday appointed Edappadi K Palaniswami as  . The Governor invited him to form the ministry at the earliest. The governor requested the chief minister-designate to seek the vote confidence of the assembly within 15 days.
