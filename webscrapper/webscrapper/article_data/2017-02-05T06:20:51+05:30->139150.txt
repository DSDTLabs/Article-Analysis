CHENNAI: As personnel from   and   struggle to contain and remove the   that has spread across almost the entire length of the city's coastline using the spade-and-bucket method, experts called for a dedicated team to handle such disasters.

 A specialised team on the lines of the   (NDRF) has to be formed to attend to oil spills in the sea or other water bodies, say activists and seafarers.
 
 Manoj Joy , coordinator of a sailors' helpline, said such a force should have its arms in the four regions -South, North, West and East -with a unified command. At present, the Indian Coast Guard coordinates operations along the coast in association with local agencies.
 
 Joy said in developed countries, the scale of initial incident and the threat posed by the spilled oil are considered very seriously. A response team will be in place and its members will be notified about an oil spill immediately . A command centre will be established and an organisational chart of response personnel and a list of their responsibilities and action to be taken in the first few hours after the incident will be notified immediately, he said.
 
 Soon after the collision of ships, the director general of shipping has to order an inquiry, but in the present case, the director general ordered an inquiry six days after the incident took place.
 
 P Muthusamy, a high court advocate who deals with issues concerning sailors, said Section 56J of the Merchant Shipping Act states that a ship's owner can be fined and imprisoned for an oil spill that brings ecological damages. Also, according to Section 352, compensation has to be paid to people affected by the oil spill. Both the sections have to be implemented after conducting an inquiry, Muthusamy said.
