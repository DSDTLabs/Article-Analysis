Legendary singer  's collection of memorabilia has been put up for sale at the price of USD 7.5 million. 

 The 67-year-old musician's mementos, being called "Ultimate Springsteen Collection" by dealer Moments in Time, contains more than 300 items, ranging from the rock icon's guitars to lyrics to clothing and more. 
 
  
  
 According to Moments in Time CEO  , the collection's seller accumulated the goods over a seven-year period of time that began after he first purchased the 1957 Chevy   in which Springsteen wrote "Born to Run." 
 
 He then went on a collection spree where he went on to build his own personal museum and contributing pieces to exhibits at the   of Fame. 
 
 "It's extraordinary that one person could assemble such a truly unbelievable collection," said Zimet. He added that although the price for all the items is fixed but he would consider selling pieces individually. 
 
 The trophies include lyrics to 'Born in the U.S.A.' 'Rosalie' 'Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out' a lyric notebook from 1968 containing 18 early songs, artifacts of Springsteen's first band, The Castiles and Springsteen's temporary driver's license from 1974, among others.
