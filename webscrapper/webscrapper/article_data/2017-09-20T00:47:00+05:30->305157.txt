Salem: Hundreds of tapioca farmers protested in Salem city urging the state government and the district administration to convene a ‘tripartite’ meeting at the earliest. They claimed that the chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami did not take any step to save thousands of farmers and the sago industry.

 Headed by the district president K Thangavelu, the members of the Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam (TNVS) organised the protest in front of ‘Sago Serve’ office in Salem city on Tuesday.
 
 Addressing the media, Thangavelu said in the last few years, all the farmers have been facing a huge loss as the state government was inactive in fixing the tapioca price. 
 
 He added that the state government also was not ready to convene a ‘tripartite’ meeting to fix the rate and sort out the issues.
 
 According to farmers, two years ago, one tonne of tapioca was sold for Rs 15,000. It has come down below Rs 7,000 this year. 
 
 “The farmers don’t have any option but to bare the loss,” Thangavel said.
 
 The farmers also said that the central government recently gave its consent to import starch taken from tapioca from foreign countries. However, we have plenty of starch in Salem and its surrounding districts. “We could save those sago units and the industry if the central government stops importing starch from abroad,” Thangavel said, adding that the state government should take this issue to central government and stop importing tapioca starch from abroad.
 
 The farmers warned if their demands are unanswered, they will lay siege to the chief minister when he visits Salem next time. “We also have planned to march to Chennai seeking action to save tapioca farmers and the industry,” Thangavel added.
