NAGPUR: As the controversy over the content of movie ‘Padmaavat’ has caused unrest in many parts of the country, a novel ‘Maharani Padmini’ was released in city, at Baburao Dhanwate Hall, on Saturday. The novel has been written by noted writer Shubhangi Gan to spread more light on the history and character of the Queen of Chittor. The inaugural ceremony was organized by Padmagandha Pratishthan as part of its silver jubilee celebrations.

 Well-known orator and writer   was the keynote speaker. Speaking about the book, he said, “It is true that   was a beauty but she had many other qualities too. Notably among those were her bravery and knowledge about warfare. Rani Padmini is a model of valour and how she rescues her husband from the jaws of  , has to be read to be believed.”
 
 “Historical novels are very soft, so no one should distort with facts while writing such books. The writer has beautifully portrayed the character of Padmini,” added Shastri.
 
 Another keynote speaker and writer Ravindra Shobhne said, “The book is well-written but there was a great scope for portraying the social atmosphere at that time. It would have given the book a good flavour. However, the timing of the book release is a great coincidence as recently the movie has caused great controversy. In this time, the book can provide more insight into the story.”
 
 Praising the writer for her way of presenting all kinds of stories and facts concerning the Rani Padmini, noted critic   said, “The writer has provided many versions of the story in the book and she has given directions to other writers as well.”
 
 “While writing a historical novel, a writer can have his/her own imagination about the character and the situation but it must be premised upon the historical facts and beliefs,” added Kulkarni.
 
 The book was released by celebrity chef Vishnu Manohar while Gan thanked all the speakers for their reviews on the book.
