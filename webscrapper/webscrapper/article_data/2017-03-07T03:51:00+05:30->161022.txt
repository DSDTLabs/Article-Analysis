Nagpur: The gruesome assault on a youth at Ram Nagar has once again raised questions about the city’s law and order. A 22-year-old man was attacked with boulders by three miscreants following a scuffle over liquor consumption in a residential area near Ram Nagar on Sunday night. Exactly a month ago, a young man was murdered in broad light at Ram Nagar square. Now, an attempt to murder at the same spot has terrorized residents. According to police, Basant Dagoria (23) , Jitu Dogar, and Nikhil Bohate (31) were consuming beer opposite Shiv Temple in Chhota Ram Nagar on Sunday at around 8.45pm. When Shubham Kanojiya (22), a resident of Pandhrabodi, objected beer consumption in front of a temple, the trio assaulted him in a fit of rage. Kanojiya head was severely injured. He also sustained injuries to the hands and body. Investigation officer PSI YT Netam told TOI that nobody came to Kanojiya’s rescue. However, a passers-by alerted the control room and patrolling Ambazari cops soon reached the spot. The cops rushed injured Kanojiya to a private hospital in Ravi Nagar. The police later arrested the trio. To a query, Netam said that the police have already started the investigation. “We are trying to establish whether they have any criminal backgrounds,” he said.
