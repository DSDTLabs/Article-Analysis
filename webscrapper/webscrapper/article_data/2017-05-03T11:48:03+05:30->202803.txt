CHENNAI: A 46-year-old   on Tuesday after he was trapped for more than 30 minutes in a fire that broke out from the Air conditioning unit in his bedroom at Villivakkam. 

 Police identified the man as VKS  , a resident of Agatheeswarar temple street. He was a   member and the district deputy secretary of the farmers wing. 
 
 Gandhirajan, who usually slept in the hall, woke up on Tuesday morning and went into his bedroom. At 9am, his family members saw smoke billowing from the bedroom. Though his wife Sangeetha, knocked the door and alerted her husband to come out, there was no response from him. Police said by then Gandhirajan was unconsious inside the room engulfed in smoke.
 
 The fire soon spread to the bed on which Gandhirajan was lying. He regained conciousness only after fire spread on his body. "Since the door was very old, it was strong, and we found it difficult to open," said  , his friend.
 
 Gandhirajan himself managed to open the door and come out of the room. As there was a delay in 108 ambulance reaching the spot, neighbours took him to a nearby private hospital in an autorickshaw. From there, he was shifted to   and Hospital, where he was admitted with 96% burns. He scumbbed to burns on Tuesday afternoon.
 
 Gandhirajan is survived by his wife and three children. Investigations revealed that the fire might have been caused due to electrical short circuit. Experts said over usage of AC during summer can overheat the equipment leading to a short ciurcuit.
