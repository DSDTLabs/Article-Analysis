Barnala: Various social and cultural outfits have opposed the Barnala district administration’s decision to organize Punjabi actor-singer   Grewal’s cultural night on March 16 to mark one-year of Captain Amarinder Singh government.

 The activists of these organizations said the district administration should hire those who contribute to enriching the culture instead of those who glorify guns and objectify women.
 
 Members of three outfits: Punjab Students Union (PSU), Punjab Lok Sabhyacharak Manch and Istri Jagriti Mahch on Monday joined hands to oppose the event and handed over a memorandum to the Barnala deputy commissioner.
 
 They also announced to hold a big protest on March 16 if the administration went ahead with its plans.
 
 Meanwhile, the district administration claimed that the night was being organized to mobilize resources for the district Red Cross Society.
 
 Istri Jagriti Manch president Charanjit Kaur said the Barnala administration, while adopting Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign, was roping in singers who portray women in bad light.
 
 Punjab Lok Sabhyachark Manch activist Harwinder Diwana said, “We will approach Punjab cultural affairs minister Navjot singh Sidhu to direct the district administration not to denigrate women in official functions. If administration goes ahead, we will hold a protest during the cultural night.”
 
 Barnala DC Ghanshyam Thori confirmed some activists have handed over a memorandum against hiring Gippy for the show. He said, “The administration is organizing the cultural night to mobilize resources to be used by the Red Cross Society for needy persons. The singer has been hired to raise funds and he has already been asked to sing only appropriate songs.”
