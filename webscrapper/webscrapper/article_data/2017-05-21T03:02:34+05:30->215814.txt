NEW DELHI:   academic   will address India’s top policy makers as part of Niti Aayog’s lecture series on “Transforming India” on May 25.

 The celebrity professor’s talk on “The Only Meaningful Concept of Competitiveness at the National level is Productivity” will be the third lecture organised by the government’s premier think tank. The government has planned a full house for the lecture by Porter who is seen as an undisputed authority on the principles of sustainable competitive advantage.
 
 From Porter’s hypothesis, which suggests strict environmental regulations can improve efficiency and encourage innovations that help improve commercial competition, to the ‘Diamond Model’, that can help understand the competitive position of a nation, his theories continue to form the basis for competitive advantage strategies around the world. The address will be followed by a panel discussion which will have Michael Green, CEO, Social Progress Imperative, Adil Zainulbhai, chairman, Quality Council of India and Pramath Raj Sinha, founder of Ashoka University as participants.
 
 With these lectures, the Aayog aims to bring globally renowned policy-makers, academics, experts and administrators to India for benefit of states and the Centre. All Union Cabinet ministers and senior officials are expected to attend Porter’s lecture.
