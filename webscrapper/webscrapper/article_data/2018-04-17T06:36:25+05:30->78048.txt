CHANDIGARH: While dismissing reports of differences with   president   and terming these as “media creation”, chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday insisted that the demand for local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s resignation over the road rage case was none of Akalis’ business and they should stay out of it.

 Talking to mediapersons in Mohali on Monday after flagging off a fleet of nine ambulances here, the chief minister lauded   MP Ambika Soni’s initiative in procuring these ambulances under MPLADS fund and urged other members of the Parliament to follow suit. Responding to questions, Amarinder said that there were absolutely no problems between him and   MP Jakhar. It was the creation of the media, which had blown out of proportion a small incident in which Jakhar had left without meeting him because he had to go somewhere else, he claimed. Last week, there were reports of Jakhar leaving CM’s office in a huff after he was asked to deposit his phone by the security staff.
 
 He also reiterated his stand that there was no need for Sidhu to quit over the   proceedings in the road rage case against him. Amarinder said the situation did not warrant his resignation. He lambasted the Akalis for seeking his resignation. In reply to a query on the Phagwara clash, Amarinder said that the situation was completely under control. While some of the culprits responsible for violence that took place on Ambedkar Jayanti were already in custody, the others would also be arrested, he maintained.
 
 There was no law and order problem now, he said, asserting that his government would not allow anyone to disturb the state’s peace and communal harmony.
 
 Earlier, Amarinder flagged off nine hi-tech ambulances equipped with worldclass equipment from Mohali. While three ambulances will cater to the needs of the people of Ropar, two have been earmarked for Mohali, three for Nawanshahr and one for Hoshiarpur.
