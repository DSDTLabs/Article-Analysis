GHAZIABAD: Two persons were arrested on Monday in connection with the   of  , who was found dead with a bullet wound in the head near IMS Engineering College on January 8. The accused, identified as Sameer and  , were close friends of Amir.

 According to police, a ‘love triangle’ was the reason behind the murder, as both Amir and Sameer wanted to marry the same girl. 
 
 When Amir apperently confronted his friend over the matter, the latter allegedly bought a country-made gun for Rs 3,000 and shot him dead near the engineering college.
 
 Amir (22) apparently had a criminal background and had been sent to   jail by a Masuri court earlier on December 25 after he was found in ‘suspicious circumstances’ with a knife. 
 
 He was released from the jail on January 7. A day later, he was found dead under mysterious circumstances.
 
 SHO (Masuri)   said: “Amir was about to marry the daughter of one of his maternal uncles very soon. They had been in a relationship for two years. After his friends asked him to conduct a loyalty test on her before the marriage, Amir gave her number to Sameer and asked him to find out the truth about her.”
 
 “However, Sameer and the girl became friends and started spending time together. In the meantime, Amir went to jail for possessing a knife. One day, Sameer took the girl to the jail, which infuriated Amir. After coming out of jail, when Amir expressed his desire to meet the girl, the latter told him that she was in Delhi with Sameer. A verbal argument between Sameer and Amir took place over the phone. Later in the night, Sameer and Salman called the victim near the college and murdered him,” added the SHO. 
 
 Amir was a suspect in a murder case in 2014, too. 
 
 However, his name was later struck off the FIR. 
 
 Amir’s father   said he ran an AC repair shop in Noida with his two associates.
