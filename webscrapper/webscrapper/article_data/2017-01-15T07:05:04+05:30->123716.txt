BENGALURU: Amith's family was still in shock on Saturday. Police were deployed outside his house in Nelamangala and no one was allowed inside. His body was in the Sapthagiri Hospital mortuary, where he was wheeled in after being declared brought dead, shot by  . 

 But, Amith's uncle   said Amith did not have an affair with Shruthi. 
 
 "It was only friendship; it was nothing more than that. Amith was a lawyer and Shruthi a block development officer. Amith was fighting several land disputes in the Nelamangala Judicial First Magistrate Court. Shruthi was consulting him over a government land issue. On Friday noon, Shruthi called Amit, asking him to meet her near Acharya College to discuss that dispute. Shruthi had brought documents and papers about it. If you see the car in which Amit was shot, you'll find these land documents and letters. They are in the pouch of the left-front door," he said, trying to hold back his tears.
 
 "We're deeply hurt by the affair reference. Rajesh always suspected his wife's fidelity whenever Shruthi spoke to men," he said, adding, "This suspicion has shattered three children's lives -- Shruthi's daughters have lost a mother and their father is in jail. Amith's son lost a father," he asked.
