MUMBAI: A student living in   has been allotted a centre at   for his NEET exam scheduled on May 6. Another student from   has got a centre at   in  . Several city students are hassled over the far-off centres allotted to them for the national medical entrance test.

 
 To avoid overcrowding, the   has given two slots for students to enter their centres - 7.30 to 8.30 am and 8.30 to 9.30 am. The ones in the 7.30-8.30 am slot will be forced to leave at least 5.30-6 am to avoid delays, say parents.
 
 The parent of the student from Virar, said that his child was expecting a centre closer home or at least on the same railway line. "With the centre in Kharghar, we have decided to book a hotel room there a night before to avoid delays in the morning. We will have to ensure that our son gets sound sleep a night before the exam. Waking up at 4 am to reach the centre at 7.30 am for the 10 am exam will only add to his stress," said the parent.
 
 Another parent, whose daughter is scheduled to write the exam in Raigad, said that he thought the centre allocation would be on first-come-first-served basis. "But this allotment seems to be system generated. We are planning to check out the location this Sunday and then we will decide how to travel on the exam day. My daughter has an 8.30-9.30 am slot to enter the exam centre, others who have the first slot will be inconvenienced a lot," said the parent. 
 
 Another parent said that his son and his friend filled the exam form at the same time, but the latter managed to get Andheri and his was allotted a centre in Navi Mumbai.
