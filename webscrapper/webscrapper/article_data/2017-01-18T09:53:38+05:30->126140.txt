PANAJI: Members of Fatorda block   accused senior Congress leaders   and Pratapsingh Rane to their faces of deserting them to fix a deal with independent MLA Vijai Sardesai. 

 The situation unfolded as Singh met block members just before leaving. The group of Congress workers demanded a clarification from Singh over his delay in announcing a candidate from Fatorda.
 
 “These people have taken money from Vijai Sardesai, even senior Rane has taken money,” block worker Piedade Noronha alleged. 
 
 Block members said they have been duped by their own leaders after working in the constituency at the ground-level. “Rahul Gandhi had promised during the rally that Congress will be contesting all 40 seats. If they can’t keep promises to their own workers, how can others trust them?” workers questioned. 
 
 The party member targeted Singh specifically, who had said the party is in a seat-sharing agreement with  . “I will be contesting on my own against Vijai Sardesai now. We won’t resign from the party, let them sack us,” block member Joseph Silva said.
