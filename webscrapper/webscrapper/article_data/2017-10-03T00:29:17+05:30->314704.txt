THANE: Over 50 members of a   cleared 10   from   in   on the anniversary of   on Monday, October 2. 

 The members of Nanasaheb Dharmadhikari Pratishthan were joined by guardian minister Eknath Shinde and Kalyan MP Shrikant Shinde. The clean-up drive went on for three hours from 8:30am to 11:30am. 
 
 Abhishek Kadam, a resident of Wagle Estate, said, “This lake has been dirty for years and people throw waste in it making it more dirty. It is great to see these groups coming to clean our lake even though they don’t belong to this area.”
 
 MP Shinde said, “Tonnes of waste have been dumped here over the years. While we found remnants of idols and decorations, we also came across a lot of household waste, plastic and rotting green waste around the sides of the lake as well as floating over the surface in the centre. We first pulled the waste to the sides and then raked it out and dumped it into the civic waste collection trucks.”
 
 While the group managed to clear the accumulated waste, they believe that any such cleanliness drive is pointless unless the locals embrace the idea of keeping their own localities clean. 
 
 “The Swachh Bharat movement was kick-started three years ago and despite the amount of cleanliness drives and awareness campaigns, it is observed that these areas lack the citizens’ will to keep it clean. Citizens still pollute the water bodies and the drains and roads with waste. For any true change to come, Thaneites should take this motto personally and start the zero-waste movement from their own homes and housing societies,” he added.
