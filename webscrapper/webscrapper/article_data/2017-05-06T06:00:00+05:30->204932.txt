NAGPUR: Commercial activity is rampant in residential areas, causing severe inconvenience to citizens right under the nose of   ( ). Ruling party leader Sandip Joshi pointed out one such case to the civic body on Friday, and action was taken immediately.

 Unfortunately, NMC had not taken any action in the case in the past, when citizens had lodged similar complaints.
 
 Joshi told TOI a notice has been served to building owner under the   and Town Planning (MRTP) Act. “Rahate Colony is a residential area. Building comprising G+7 floors has been constructed at   and put into use for a beauty clinic. There is no parking inside the building for visitors to the beauty clinic. Also, the building owner demolished compound wall of Punjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PDKV) and encroached on some land. The building also does not have proper permissions from fire and emergency services department,” he said.
 
 Joshi added that vehicles of visitors were being parked in the residential lane creating problems for citizens. “The beauty clinic operator has engaged bouncers so that citizens do not oppose parking of vehicles on the road. I also have doubt about FSI consumed since such a big structure has come up on a plot measuring 1,800 sq ft,” he said.
 
 Joshi said NMC should conduct proper inspection and initiate immediate action against such unauthorized constructions. “It is a problem for residents and also visitors if parking area is not provided at the buildings, especially when it come to commercial establishments. Delay in action in such cases also raise a question mark on NMC. Also, it becomes difficult for the NMC to initiate action in large number of cases if it not initiated on regular basis. NMC should act immediately after receiving complaints about lack of parking or commercial activities in residential areas. Action will be taken against engineers who neglect citizens’ complaints,” he said.
