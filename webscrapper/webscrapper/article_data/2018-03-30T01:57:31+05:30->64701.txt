NOIDA:   at the district hospital are likely to be affected on Friday as doctors and medical staff have called for a strike. The call for strike allegedly follows a quarrel between doctors and   over residential quarters. 

 According to pharmacist  , his wife Neelam Singh was abused by the institute staff on March 24 at the society's residential quarters. "A doctor and two members of themedical staff from the district hospital misbehaved with my wife. I was away when the incident took place. We reported the matter to the local police station but they refused to register an FIR," he said.
 
 The institute management gave a different version.   said the residential quarters, in which the pharmacist's family stays, was meant for gazetted officers only. He said that last week, some boys were playing cricket in the playground while some staff members of institute were sitting nearby. "The ball landed in the pharmacist's house and the woman rushed outside. She started quarrelling with the staff and alleged she was abused," he said. Bhatta claimed the allegations were not true.
 
 He said some people had illegally occupied accommodations in the four towers, which is a bone of contention. 
 
 The staff association of the institute has planned a parallel protest on Friday, demanding eviction of people who have illegally occupied houses. "Some people have occupied two houses in Tower 7. There are some junior staff who have occupied houses in tower 5 meant for gazetted officer. We demand a proper investigation and audit of the allotment," the organisation said in a statement. They have also demanded deployment of female security guards on the campus for safety.
 
 The hospital and institute officials said the emergency services would be functional despite the protests on Friday.
