MUMBAI:   is set to get a makeover. The area, where the truck terminus is located, will be revamped with the regional planning agency, MMRDA, approving a plan to transform it into a business district with a provision for residential properties.   will carry out development on 64 hectares of land of the total 109 hectares that it owns.

 Chief minister   said that the landscape of the area is set to change into a business district after proposed master plan to convert Wadala into a business district was given approval. “We have proposed mixed use of the land for both residential and commercial use,” said Fadnavis. “We have also proposed setting up of a transport hub along the lines of ISBT in Wadala.” ISBT refers to an inter-state bus terminus.
 
 He also said that developing Wadala will help generate revenue for MMRDA quite like the development of Bandra-Kurla Complex.
 
 MMRDA, which is the special planning authority for the Wadala business district, has proposed to scrap the truck terminal and instead develop it for the inter-state bus terminus.
 
 A senior official said, “We will develop it as a smart business district with Wi-Fi facility, parking guidance system and an advanced CCTV system network.”
 
 Wadala is billed to become a transportation hub due to its proximity to Eastern   and since it offers connectivity to Monorail. Also, the fourth Metro line planned via Wadala offers connectivity to Thane and Chhattrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus.
 
 Mumbai Port Trust is also carrying out a revamp of its land to convert it into a recreation and entertainment hub.
 
 MMRDA had plans to have tall buildings but height restrictions imposed by International Civil Aviation Organisationin will impact MMRDA’s revenue potential.
 
 MMRDA commissioner UPS   said, “The master plan will now have to be approved by the state government. The urban development department will now invite suggestions and objections. We hope this process will be completed in three months.”
