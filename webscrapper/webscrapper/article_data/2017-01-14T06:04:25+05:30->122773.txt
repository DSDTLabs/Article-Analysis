PUNE: A   on Thursday alleged that he was duped of Rs 25 lakh in   by an acquaintance. 

 The contractor claimed that he had given the money to his friend for depositing it in his bank account on November 11 last year.
 
 However, he neither deposited the money in the contractor’s bank account nor did he return the cash to the contractor, prompting the latter to lodge a complaint with the  . 
 
 Sub-inspector VS Mule said the complainant is a Wanowrie resident. The suspect works in a cooperative credit society at Wanowrie. Last year he approached the contractor and requested him to open an account in their credit society.
 
 “The contractor claimed that he tried depositing the cash in his bank, but due to heavy rush he couldn’t,” he added.
 
 Mule said, “He told the contractor that his brother-in-law was a manager in a public sector bank.” He requested the suspect to deposit the cash in his bank account as he had some work in Nashik.
 
 However, he returned to find that the amount was not deposited to his account. “When contacted, the suspect promised to deposit it immediately. The contractor waited for two months for him to deposit the money, before lodging the complaint,” Mule said.
 
 Investigations revealed the suspect’s relative was not a manager, but a temporary security guard in the bank. “We have booked the duo under section 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code. We are yet to arrest them,” Mule said.
