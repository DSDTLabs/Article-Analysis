New Delhi:   had to prematurely withdraw its   to pay salaries for June due to delayed release of grants by University Grants Commission (UGC). 

 While officials said the university administration managed the situation this month, it would be difficult to pay salaries in future if grants are delayed.
 
 In a separate case, all the employees of Centre of Study of Social Inclusion and Inclusive Policy have not been paid their salaries since April this year. The employees claim that the administration told them that the university has not received funds from the UGC either.
 
 There are 715 teachers and 1,180 non-teaching staff in Jamia. The university needs over Rs 12-crore grant for salaries. While UGC sends the money before the last working day so that the salaries are paid on time, according to a   source, the university received the money only on July 4.
 
 “Unlike  , the university doesn’t have much corpus to manage on its own,” said an official. The Jamia administration, however, refused to comment on the matter, stating that the university will take it up with the authorities concerned.
