GURGAON: Even after imposing penalty on an offender for felling 63 trees and seizing a truck that was being used to dump construction and demolition waste on a one-and-a-half acre plot near Ghata-Gwalpahari along the Gurgaon-Faridabad road in December, an incident of dumping of waste was again reported from the same spot on Monday evening. 

 Environmentalists claimed that a truck was seen dumping construction and demolition waste on the plot and an earth moving machine was found parked at the site. As the area is protected under sections 4 & 5 of Punjab Land Preservation Act, no non-forest activity is permitted there.
 
 This was the second incident of waste dumping reported from the site, despite environmentalists informing the forest department of the violations. “On December 30, when I spotted a truck dumping waste, I reported the matter to the forest department. However, when I called up the department on Monday to report the second incident, I was informed that the department, till now, hasn’t filed a police complaint in the December 30 case. It is shocking that despite imposing penalties and seizing trucks, the department didn’t file a police complaint,” said Vaishali Rana Chandra, an environmental activist. 
 
 Green activists have been reporting rampant tree felling, waste dumping and encroachment taking place in the   for the last three-four months. While Colonel SS Oberoi, a legal expert and an environmentalist, had sent a notice to the MCG, under Section 30 of the Central Act 10 of 1994 on January 9, demanding action against offenders; last month he met union environment minister   and sought his intervention.
 
 When asked, a forest official said, “We have already imposed penalty on the offender for felling of trees. We will take strict action against the offender as he has resumed dumping of waste on the plot.”
