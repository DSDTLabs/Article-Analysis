NEW DELHI: The name   might not ring a bell, but he happens to be a podium contender in weightlifting at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast City, Australia from April 4-15. While   and Satish Sivalingam are among the Indians to regularly attract the headlines in the sport, this youngster from Andhra has quietly build his reputation of a serious medal prospect.

 
 
 
 Weightlifting is one sport where India have traditionally performed well at the CWG, with over 100 medals to date which places them at third in the all-time list behind Australia and England. It is for this reason that at least four weightlifters - Mirabai (48kg), Sathish (77kg),   (53kg) and Rahul (85kg) - are being considered as sure-shots to land medals. 
 
 Rahul's breakthrough performance came at the raw age of 17 years when he won two gold medals in the youth and junior categories of the Commonwealth Youth and Junior Weightlifting Championship in Malaysia in 2013.
 
 
 
 He qualified for the 2018 CWG by winning gold at the 2017 Commonwealth Senior Weightlifting Championships also in Gold Coast, lifting a total of 351kg (156kg in snatch and 195kg in clean & jerk). In fact, he won two gold medals in junior and senior categories and setting a couple of records.
 
 
  
  
 
 As a reward, the Andhra government announced a cash reward of INR 15 lakh for him.
 
 Rahul, 20, hails from Guntur and has a younger brother Varun who also happens to be a weightlifter and also qualified for the CWG 2018. While Rahul's ultimate dream is to win a gold at the Olympics, he would want to add more weight to it by putting up an impressive show at the CWG. 
 
 
 Deepak Lather (69kg), Gururaja (56kg), Raja Muthupandi (62kg), Venkat Rahul Ragala (85kg), Pardeep Singh (105kg), Gurdeep Singh (.+105kg), Sathish Kumar Sivalingam (77kg), Vikas Thakur (94kg)
