Trichy: The Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association (TNPGTA) has decided not to perform evaluation work during the month of May this year as they claim it would eat into their vacation time. 

 The move by the association with over 12,000 teachers across the state is likely to delay the results for class XI. 
 
 Higher secondary teachers usually complete board exam paper evaluation in April and return back to school in June during reopening after a month long vacation in May. 
 
 However, this year onwards they will have to spend half of May also for evaluation as class XI students will be appearing for board exams.
 
 Till last year, the respective schools were evaluating the answer scripts of class XI students and publishing the results.
 
 Stating that 12,000 teachers from the association will not be part of the evaluation work in May, Kumaravel, president of the association, said that evaluation of class XI answer scripts can be done after schools reopen in June. 
 
 “As students in class XI will not be detained even if they fail in a few subjects, the government should conduct the valuation in June as delay in results would not affect the students,” he said. 
 
 A headmaster from a city government school while speaking on the same lines said that the worst affected would be the language teachers who will have to evaluate double the papers than subject teachers since students appear for two language papers. 
 
 “The government should also appoint additional staff to the take care of the evaluation process,” he added.
