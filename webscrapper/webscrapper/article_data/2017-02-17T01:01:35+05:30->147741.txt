MUMBAI: Despite a demand from the   to ban the   mouthpiece, Saamna, the Election Commission may not act. On Wednesday, BJP spokesperson Shweta Shalini wrote to the EC, seeking a ban on Saamna for three days on February 16,20 and 21 till the elections in the state as well as Mumbai are completed. 

 EC officials said that any such action is unlikely. “We can’t ban them randomly, the content that a newspaper publishes is governed under the expression of freedom norms, we cannot intervene in this issue,” said a senior EC official.
 
 “There is a ban on publishing content or undertaking publicity campaigns two days before the polling date. However, Saamna is flouting this norm,” state unit BJP spokesperson Shweta Shalini said in a letter to EC. 
 
 Reacting to the BJP’s demand, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said that, “The situation in the country has become worse than the internal Emergency imposed in 1975.”
