VADODARA: The city administration as well as the   (NHSRC) are now considering the possibility of having two terminals for the bullet train in the city. The move was discussed during the latest meeting of the   officials with those from the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) and other agencies including the Vadodara division of the Western Railway.

 At a meeting in February, all parties involved in the process of facilitating the bullet train terminal had discussed the possibility of having a terminal towards the Jetalpur side instead of the platform number six. Taking this forward, the possibility of having two terminals – one opposite the Alkapuri side of the railway station and another on the eastern side of the railway tracks towards   and Sayajigunj – was discussed.
 
 Sources said that at a meeting last month, the NHSRC, VMC and others have agreed in principle towards the possibility of having two terminals. Both these terminals could be connected to the boarding point near the platform number six using escalators and travelators or moving walkways.
 
 The plans, however, are still at a preliminary stage. While a small plot of land would be needed for the terminal towards Alkapuri, the VMC will have to vacate the Kadakbazaar for the larger and the main terminal. Apart from the VMC land, the rest of the land parcel to be used for the project included the land of the railway colony that has some structures that are not in use any more and a private building.
 
 According to sources, there would be major changes in the traffic movement in the station area in wake of the development of the terminals. 
 
 They added that this would ensure smoother traffic flow instead of the existing chaos in the   area. “The Jetalpur railway underbridge will also be widened to handle more traffic moving towards the bullet train station and Sayajigunj,” said VMC commissioner Vinod Rao.
