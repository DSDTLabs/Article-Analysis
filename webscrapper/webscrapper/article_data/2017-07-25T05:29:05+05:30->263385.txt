BHOPAL: Less trauma, minimal scarring, significantly reduced blood loss and post operative pain and faster recovery time is the new frontier with robot assisted surgery, said consultant laparoscopic and robotic gynaecology surgeon, Dr Imran Hamzawala. He will deliver a lecture on robot assisted surgery and its benefits, here on Tuesday.

 “No patient wants a large incision for his or her surgery. Given a choice, a scar and less pain would be opted by all. Complex surgeries are being carried out robotically in India too,” said Mumbai-based Dr Imran Hamzawala.
 
 Having an operation and leaving with minimal scarring, is the new hope for patients and doctors. Robotic surgery requires small incisions through which the robotic arms and camera enter and the surgery is carried out by a surgeon sitting comfortably on a console.
 
  “The instruments are in complete control of the surgeon. The robot’s movements are guided by the doctor. With this new technology, complex operations are now being carried out via the minimal access route with robot assistance which once would have been deemed impossible,” said Dr Hamzawala. “3D vision and magnification and help of robotic arms could well be a reality in state capital soon. Top private sector surgeons were impressed by display of demo robotic surgery at the hospital,” said   hospital, gastroenterology and minimal invasive surgery expert, Dr  .
 
 Widely used, laparoscopic surgery depends on 2-d vision and the surgeon has to stand and perform the operation. Replace it with, robotic arms, a 10x high-definition 3-d camera, the perspective and control of the surgeon is vastly improved.
