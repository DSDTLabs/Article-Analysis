JALANDHAR: After the polling in Punjab, Shiromani Akali Dalâ€™s Delhi unit president   has launched scathing attack on Sirsa Dera chief by saying that he would raise the issue of support extended by the Dera to SAD in the Punjab assembly election at party forum. He is also the president of   (DSGMC). 

 "Despite the announcement of support by the Dera to SAD, the DSGMC is firm on its stand that Sirsa Dera was sheltering anti-Sikh forces and we have no business to argue support to a person of such character," said GK in a statement issued on Saturday evening.
 
 While SAD candidates had announced to organize Satsangs (congregations) of the Dera in Punjab, GK said that they would oppose these congregations in Punjab. "Our old stand against him remains unchanged. We have always spoken and argued against him whenever we were called by the national media on his issue and we shall continue doing so," he said. In the past too we opposed his films and did not allow his films to be screened in Delhi.
 
 GK also asked his opponents to question "their mentors" about later's closeness to Nirankaris and why were they not questioning the massacre of Sikhs and Operation Blue Star.
 
 Notably DSGMC elections are also being held in a few weeks and SAD getting Sirsa Dera support in Punjab elections is likely to give handle to opponents of the party in Delhi.
