JODHPUR: A four-member committee will now probe into the allegations by the sanitary wards incharge on the councillors and heads of two sanitation committees demanding monthly amount. Finally, after about a fortnight since the issue was raked up and a preliminary investigation started by the city   president, a panel headed by mayor is now looking into the matter. 

 The panel comprises the deputy mayor Devendra Salecha, head of the JMC marketing committee Hari Gopal Rathi, and two former party presidents (city) Prasan Chand Mehta and Narendra Kachhawaha. The committee will be submitting its report to the mayor in 15 days.
 
 “We have directed them to complete the inquiry in 15 days and submit the report to me,” said mayor   assuring action based on the report outcome.
 
 The allegations by the sanitary inspectors had created a wide ruckus in the JMC, with both the councillors and sanitary inspectors demanding action against each other. It was followed by the suspension of one sanitary inspector by the mayor, which was, however, withdrawn within 24 hours after the suspended inspector tendered apology.
 
 The issue had further heated up when some audios revealing the communication regarding money between the heads of two sanitary committees of the JMC and the sanitary staff went viral, unveiling the corrupt practices prevalent within the JMC.
 
 The inquiry, however, was then conducted by BJP president Devendra Joshi, who submitted his preliminary report to the state president Ashok Parnami, who showed his discontent with the report.
 
 “Even then, the two councillors, the heads of these two committees, had skipped meeting with him, which required a serious inquiry into the matter for the sake of the image of the party in the city,” said a party leader.
