NAGPUR: Even as transport department dithers on passenger safety in red buses, Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s Aapli buses are operating on city roads with either defunct or no doors. 

 As per NMC’s official statistics, doors of 200 standard buses of its 375 fleet (25 ethanol-run air-conditioned, 200 standard and 150 midi buses) are defunct. As per a notification, doors are mandatory in city buses to curb footboard travelling. 
 
 On Thursday, TOI spotted many buses with footboard travellers and open doors on Wadi,   and   routes.
 
 “According to the conductors, the doors are not repaired despite complaints to the depot officials. The doors appear closed in some buses but there is a big gap between them. A child can easily fall through it,” said Rahul Bhalerao, a resident of Kamptee and a daily traveller.
 
 Gajanan Pande, a consumer right activist, said that bus crew as well as citizens lack traffic discipline and it shows how poorly buses are maintained.
 
 As per the commuters, the officials do not bother to monitor condition of the buses. “Checking inspectors must ensure that the bus doors aren’t open, interiors are clean and buses halt at the allotted bays. But, this is never done,” they said.
 
 As a practice, once a bus enters the depot, drivers note defects in the vehicle in a log sheet. The officials concerned have to rectify the fault. “But this is not done in most cases,” said a source from the transport department.
 
 Transport committee chairman   assured to look into the matter. He also asked transport department officials to identify buses with defective automatic doors. “If the fault is not rectified within a stipulated period of time, action will be taken against the officials concerned,” he said.
