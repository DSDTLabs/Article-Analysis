JAIPUR: A 40-year-old woman was brutally killed and her face set on fire by unidentified assailants who dumped her half-charred body near a vacant plot in Amber area of the city on Monday morning.

 While the police have yet to establish the identity of the deceased, the cops suspect that she was a resident of a nearby village. “Prima facie, it appears that she was murdered elsewhere and her body was dumped here. To conceal her identity, the criminals set woman’s body on fire,” said  , additional DCP (North Jaipur).
 
 The body was recovered near a dental college on Monday morning by a villager who informed the police. The right hand and face of the victim was charred beyond recognition. The forensic experts have collected samples of petrol and blood from the spot and sent it for the examination. 
 
 The police have ruled out the possibility of the loot as jewellery on her body was intact, including gold chains and bangles. “The woman was killed late night and her body was dumped here on early morning,” said police.
 
 The victim’s cloths were also burnt in the fire and her throat was slit. “The spot from which we recovered the body is completely isolated from the main  . There are chances of her being killed near any village and body being dumped here,” said police.
 
 The Amber police have asked control room to check if any missing complaint was lodged in last two days. The cops have kept the body at the mortuary of the hospital and waiting for her relatives to come forward. “There are no CCTVs in the area. Therefore, it would be difficult to check when was she murdered,” police said, adding that two teams have been sent to find the culprit.
