NEW DELHI: India and Sweden are looking for some big outcomes at Tuesday’s summit when Prime Minister   travels to Stockholm for a bilateral meeting and the first Indo-Nordic conference with Iceland, Finland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

 
 India and Sweden will sign a general security agreement, which is a precondition for Sweden to share sensitive technology with India if, for instance, Swedish company Saab is chosen to build fighter jets in India. The agreement has been finalised and will be signed during the PM’s visit. 
 
 Bilaterally, India and Sweden may sign an innovation partnership agreement. The pact is derived from a broader agreement by India and Sweden in 2016 during the visit of the Swedish PM   to India — the two sides are hoping to focus on a few areas which will get greater attention.
 
 Modi will arrive in Stockholm on Monday evening and stay overnight. On Tuesday, Modi will call on the king of Sweden before heading to a ‘restricted’ meeting with the Swedish PM before formal delegation talks. After a meeting with industry captains, Modi will hold separate bilateral summits with the other Nordic countries. 
 
 It will be only the second time that all five Nordic countries will have a summit with one country, the only other time was with the US during Barack Obama’s term. The only difference — this will be a summit of heads of government, not including heads of state.
 
 For India, it will mark another first. It will be the first time India and Denmark will put behind an uncomfortable phase in their bilateral ties for a summit-level meeting, the first since the Purulia arms drop case soured relations between New Delhi and Copenhagen.
 
 Smart cities, renewables, trade and investment and climate change will dominate discussions in Stockholm — sources said, Modi, has been particularly keen to build closer ties with the Nordic countries.
