NEW DELHI: Blocked toilets have often forced aircraft to divert, but in a possible first, a plane had to do so due to pungent smell emanating from a lavatory.

 A few minutes into the flight, the 188 passengers on a Bangalore-Delhi   on Sunday complained of the smell coming from the front lavatory. The smell kept getting stronger and soon became impossible for the crew and passengers to bear. The pilots, themselves battling the foul smell, then decided to land at the nearest airport, Hyderabad.
 
 A   spokesman said: “SpiceJet B-737 operating (as) SG192 had to be diverted to Hyderabad due to very foul smell from forward lavatory coming into the cockpit. After landing in Hyderabad, the lavatory and cockpit were thoroughly cleaned and ventilated before the aircraft was released for service.“
