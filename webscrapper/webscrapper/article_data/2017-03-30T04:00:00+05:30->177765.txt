Even on a formal basis, companies procure some goods from smaller players who will be outside the ambit of the   system. Given the hassles involved when purchases are made from unregistered sellers, its likely that the business of the smaller players will be hit. The other issue relates to challenges in claiming input tax credit. “A proviso to section 16(2) provides that, failure to make ‘payment’ to the vendor for supply of goods or services, within 180 days from the issue of invoice, will result in reversal of input tax credit.

 “The complexity arises because the Bill provides that the amount equal to the input tax credit availed shall be added to the output tax liability together with interest thereon. The current rate of interest is 15% per annum. When the buyer ultimately pays the vendor after 180 days, there is an adjustment for the input tax credit that had been added back, but not for interest. The interest liability remains a sunk cost,” explains Narayanan. Under the matching concept provisions, the onus continues to remain on the buyer to check whether the seller has paid GST.
