NEW DELHI: Chief minister   has added a rider to his   by   in the case of alleged assault on   at the CM’s residence in February. He wants the entire proceedings to be captured on camera. He was responding to a Delhi Police notice sent to him on Wednesday, informing him of the decision question him. He had been asked to let the police know where he would be available on Friday.

 
 “Due to some prior commitments, I would not be able to join the investigation at 11am,” Kejriwal wrote in a letter to the SHO, Civil Lines police station, and informed that he would be available at his camp office to join the investigations at 5pm on Friday.
 
 “If you have any objection (to my   the proceedings), then I would request you to kindly make arrangements at your end to video record the same, and in such a case, a copy of the video recording may be provided after the conclusion of my questioning,” Kejriwal told the police.
 
 Delhi Police sources said they will not allow any video recording of the questioning as it is against existing provisions. The questioning will be held as per the guidelines of Section 160 of CrPC, a senior cop said. The police is now likely to go to the CM’s residence on Friday evening.
 
 AAP’s Delhi chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj has said that it would be “the first instance in the democratic history of the country that a CM is being questioned by police in a false case.” AAP has been accusing the CS of filing a fabricated case.
 
 The police have decided to question Kejriwal because the alleged assault on the CS took place in the CM’s drawing room during a meeting that was convened by him and he was present at the meeting. Soon after the case was lodged, two AAP MLAs were arrested.
