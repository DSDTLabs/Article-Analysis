One of Kannada cinema’s most popular comedians,   is all set for a new avatar. In director Guru Deshpande’s next, Samhaara, shooting for which is currently underway in Mangaluru, the actor will be seen in the role of a cop, and a very serious one at that. “I play a police officer called  , which explains the get-up, including the style of moustache made famous by Yash in the film Raja Huli. My character does provide laughs, but that is not his primary role in the story. The humour in   is situational and I do not have a separate comedy track,” says Chikkanna, adding that the character is integral to the tale and will be seen in close to 70% of the film. The team, including lead actor  , is on a 30-day schedule in the coastal city.
