FIROZABAD/AGRA: After five   assistant engineers were suspended for allegedly showing an expenditure of Rs 3 crore as “developmental work” in Firozabad and spending it on ex-CM Akhilesh Yadav’s public rallies, a cashier of the department has also been found guilty. Senior officials said action was expected to be taken against more officials in the coming days.
 
  Sources said no official work has been assigned to cashier   after his role jn the scam was found to be suspicious.
  
  The role of a former executive engineer   is also under the scanner. The probe is being conducted by Meerut’s PWD chief engineer.
  
  Yadav has been accused of paying huge sums of money to a construction company for carrying out road repairs in the city. This in turn was spent on Akhilesh’s rallies .
  
  Recently, five PWD assistant engineers were suspended for attaching inflated bills for “making arrangements” during the public rallies of former UP chief minister  . After a complaint was received by the state government, a special team was constituted to probe the allegations.
  
  Sources said during the   regime, the responsibility of making arrangements for Akhilesh’s events in Shikohabad, Firozabad and Sirsaganj was given to the regional PWD offices. The department was instructed to make high-level arrangements for the former CM’s functions without bothering about the funds required for the same.
  
  Lakhs of rupees were allegedly spent on these lavish functions and these engineers showed the expenditure incurred during these events under the development work category.
