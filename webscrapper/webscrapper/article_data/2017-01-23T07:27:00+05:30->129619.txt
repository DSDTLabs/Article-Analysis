ROHTAK: Shedding the image of having skewed child sex ratio, 12 of the 21 districts in Haryana have for the first time crossed the psychological barrier of 900 girls per 1,000 boys (in the age group of 0 to 6 years) thus bringing the overall gender ratio of the state to 900. This has been revealed by data from civil registration system for January to December 2016.

 Districts infamous in this regard, like Sirsa and Fatehabad, have come up among toppers while Gurugram and Faridabad, sharing proximity with New Delhi, finished on the lower rungs. A total of 5,25,278 births took place in the state last year out of which 2,48,864 were girls.
 
 The districts dominated by Jat community, where reports of honour killing and female foeticide are widely reported, have also registered better child sex ratio of above 900. Rohtak is at the 10th rank where 24,900 births took place with 11,831 girls, bringing the sex ratio to 905. Sonipat registered 29,782 total births out of which 14,113 were girls, making the sex ratio 901. Gurugram is at the 18th position in the tally registering 33,103 births out of which 17,577 were girls, putting the sex ratio at 883. Faridabad finished at the 15th position with the sex ratio 895. Narnaul and Kurukshetra got the lowest tally at 850.
 
 Haryana health minister Anil Vij’s home district Ambala is at the 6th position with the sex ratio of 912, better than Karnal (908) which has the constituency of chief minister  . Another district which surprised the health authorities in child sex ratio is Mewat with a total of 45,944 births reported in 2016, out of which 24,024 were girls taking the sex ratio to 912, better than 15 districts of Haryana. Bhiwani district, however, is at the 14th position in the tally with sex ratio of 895, but it has drastically improved from its tally in 2015. 
 
 The state health authorities have not lagged behind in registering FIRs under   (PNDT) Act/Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act. From April to November, 2016, 372 FIRs have been registered against persons who carried out sex determination tests. The highest number of FIRs registered are 36 in Panipat, followed by Yamunagar at 35, Gurugram 10, Panchkula 9 and Mewat 2.
 
 Lauding the efforts of the state health authorities,   Kavita Jain said the campaign started by Prime Minister   had started yielding results two years ago. “The government has gone down to village level to celebrate and promote birth of girl child through various welfare schemes and it has boosted the confidence of the people to raise girl child,” she said.
