 The runners said that the event was different and challenging as running on the mountain trails is a different ball game altogether. Gurgaon resident  , who competed in the 7km run, said, "The trail is very tough, the path is stony and at times steep. You have to be constantly alert and looking at the ground to avoid injury. That's a unique challenge, which is also a lot of fun."
 
  
  Run like a pro!
