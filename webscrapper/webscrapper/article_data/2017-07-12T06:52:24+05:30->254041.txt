 Sharing the sequence of events as narrated to her by Danish, she said, "He told me that the accident happened at a sharp turn and there was some water on that stretch. All he remembers is that the car went spinning into the air after that and took several turns, which caused giddiness. He couldn't give any further details." 
 
 Sabiha said that she hadn't told her 18-year-old son about Fasahat's death yet.
 
 Meanwhile, doctors at   in  , where the injured teenager was first rushed to, said that he had suffered a fracture on his left elbow.

 It was later learnt that Danish was being moved to  , in another part of the town.
