MUMBAI: The state government is yet to register a first information report (FIR) against 22 persons, including   officials and contractors, who were found to be involved in a minor repair work  . 

 A probe by state public works department (PWD) of   carried out in state-owned buildings in south Mumbai revealed irregularities in awarding contract and an unnecessary payment of over Rs 10 lakh to few contractors. The report has recommended criminal cases against the PWD officials and contractors but the department has yet to act on it.
 
 PWD minister Chandrakant Patil told TOI that the process was on. “I have sanctioned the file regarding the FIR and will get necessary work done once Maharashtra chief minister   gives his go-ahead,” said Patil.
 
 BJP legislator Prashant Bamb who is following the corruption case alleged that few officials from the administration were trying to defend the guilty officials. “The government should not protect corrupt officials and should take action against them as soon as possible,” said Bamb.
 
 Following the complaints received about suspected irregularities, Bamb wrote to the department in April 2017 demanding a probe into the issue. 
 
 Subsequently, the department has conducted an internal probe and appointed a flying squad headed by superintendent engineer Dhananjay Chamalawar, who submitted a report to the government in the last week of February.
 
 Out of 658 cases, the squad chose 50-odd randomly, and investigated them in detail. It found irregularities in some of them. Among other observations, it was said the extra payment of Rs 10 lakh had been made by the department.
