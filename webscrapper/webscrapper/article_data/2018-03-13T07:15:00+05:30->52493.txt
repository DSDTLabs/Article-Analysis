Noida: The power department has procured a ‘fault finding machine’ which will now help locate any damage in underground cable in much less time than required during earlier under manual process. The   is titled as Megger Cable Fault Test Van and is also called cable fault pre-locator.

 The machine is a fault location system installed on small vans/vehicles which operates through computerised testing, pre-location, pinpointing and burning of cable in low and medium voltage networks. It uses advanced technology for fault distance measurement which helps unskilled operator to locate the damage with accuracy and dig only in the area where the fault is located rather than pulling out the entire cable as was practised earlier.
