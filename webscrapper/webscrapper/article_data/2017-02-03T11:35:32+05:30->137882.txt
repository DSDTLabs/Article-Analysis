BHOPAL: Auto-rickshaw drivers and owners in state capital called off their 38 hour-long strike on Thursday afternoon much to the relief of harried and inconvenienced train passengers.

 Softening their stand, auto drivers claimed that the transport commissioner assured auto-drivers he would make it mandatory for IT-enabled cabs to run on permit. 
 
 Talking to TOI, Pappu Rajput, president,  , said “On Wednesday, we met transport commissioner  . He assured us he would see to it in 20 day that the IT-enabled cabs run on permit. We are facing problems because cabs are not following permission rules.”
 
 “We are facing hardship as a result of which we have decided to call off our strike for 15 days. If officials failed to fulfill our demands, we would resort to strike again. This time, it will be on a larger scale,” he said.
 
 We are planning to go on a strike with mini-buses and Magic van owners on or after February 20. Once it happens, public transportation will come to a grinding halt. It will create pressure on officials, he said.
 
 On Thursday morning, while the strike was on, an auto was found carrying passengers, which was caught by other auto-drivers near  . This triggered an argument and a ruckus among drivers at the spot. However, other auto drivers punctured his auto.
