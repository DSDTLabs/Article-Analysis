Actor   is known to speak his mind and that is what he did when he was in   on Wednesday. Speaking at a press meet in that city, the actor said, “No political party or any political leader can ever resolve the   water dispute. The reason for this is clear — politicians use this issue for political mileage. Therefore, the people of   and   have to unite to fight to reverse climate change, instead of fighting over the share of Cauvery water.”

 To illustrate his point, Prakash noted that when several countries are peacefully using the water of the Nile, why can’t the two states in India do the same with Cauvery? “Both states need to discuss the rejuvenation of lakes and wells, and the development of forests in the catchment area of the river. They also need to be strict and curb the sand mafia and the encroachment of the river basin. If Karnataka and Tamil Nadu don’t take such concrete steps immediately, the future of the river is very bleak,” Prakash said. 
 
 The actor also said that his 'Just Asking Foundation' is making a documentary on the Cauvery, which is expected to be completed in month. The documentary will look at sand mining and river encroachment, among other issues affecting the Cauvery. Prakash added that he also plans on make a similar documentary on the Mahadayi.
