NEW DELHI: The   of Delhi Police has   a   supplying   in the capital and   a distributor with fake notes having a   in the denomination of Rs 2,000.

 The module procured the fake notes from their contact in Malda, West Bengal after these were smuggled in from Pakistan from across the border. The accused, Mumtaz Ansari (48), sold the notes for 30% commission.
 
 According to DCP (special cell) P S Kushwah, a team led by ACP Govind Sharma and inspector Sanjay Dutt had received a tip off about and laid a trap on Minto Road. The suspected was nabbed from near the government quarters.
 
 Kushwaha said the recovered fake notes are high quality counterfeits as they cannot be detected by naked eye. However, there are certain evident discrepancies if scanned in bulk.
 
 “The quality of paper, printing, colour and thread mark appears to be genuine, but some security features are missing. Some notes have the same serial numbers,” he added.
 
 The accused told cops that he was earlier arrested in 2010 and was in jail till 2014. After his release, he joined the trade again. He procured the notes from a Pak-based man who delivered the consignment at the border by throwing the consignment packet above the wire fencing.
 
 This is the fourth seizure of new notes in many months, indicating that Pak-based printers have been able to print a sizeable amount of new notes in the year after demonetisation.
