NEW DELHI. Indian cuisine restaurant Baadal is one of the Silicon Valley’s most popular food outlet that caters to   employees.

 It came into existence after several employees of Indian origin at Google expressed their desire to have ‘desi’ food.
 
 When   awardee   recently visited the Google campus for a talk, the restaurant pulled out all the stops to ensure that the legendary composer felt at home.
 
 Baadal chef Mahesh Kumar created a ‘Raja-centric’ menu for the occasion with dishes named after several of his iconic films and songs. 
 
 The music composer was surprised to find ‘Annakili’ poondu rasam, ‘Thalapathy’ pumpkin erissery, ‘Naachiyar’ paneer milagu masala, and ‘Thaara Thappattai’ puli sadam as some of the specialities on offer for the occasion.
 
 Ilaiyaraaja is currently in US for a musical concert tour and was invited by Google earlier this week to hold a talk on the power of music in life’s journey.
 
 While at Google, Raja decided to take a refreshment break at the Baadal, which has become extremely famous in California among Tamilians settled in the US. Some of these Tamilians requested Ilaiyaraaja to try out its cuisine and the music director paid heed to their advice. 
 
  Ever since Ilaiyaraaja’s visit, the manager of the restaurant has been inundated with various calls requesting him to make the Raja-themed menu permanent.
