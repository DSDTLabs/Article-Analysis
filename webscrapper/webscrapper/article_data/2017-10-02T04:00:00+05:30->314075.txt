Vadodara: His father made a name for himself in international cricket by being one of the best wicket-keepers the Indian team had. Now, Mohit Mongia, son of Nayan Mongia, has now set his eyes on entering the big league. Eighteen-year-old Mohit has been appointed as captain of the Baroda U-19 team by the selectors. Mohit will lead the team for the upcoming season. 

 Mohit, a left-arm spinner and middle-order batsman, began his cricketing career in the Under-14 team and also played for Hindu Gymkhana in the same age category. He went on to play for U-16 and U-19 Baroda teams as well. “He is just 18 years old but plays and behaves like a matured man. Mohit has a thinking brain and a heart to take on any bowler. I always ask other junior cricketers to learn from him,” said Atul Bedade, Baroda Ranji coach, who coached Mohit for two years in the past. 
 
 Mohit scored a blistering 91 runs off 36 balls and bagged six wickets against Vyara in Maharaja Fatesingrao Gaekwad Inter-District U-19 tournament held in June at Billimora. “It’s a great achievement for Mohit who has been made captain of U-19 team. I am glad that the selectors have shown faith in him. He will perform to the best of his ability,” Nayan told TOI. When asked whether he wanted his son to become a wicket-keeper too, Nayan said that Mohit took up cricket as it came to him naturally. “I never forced him to play the game,” he added.
