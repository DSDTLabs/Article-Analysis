Puducherry: Lt governor Kiran Bedi has welcomed welfare minister M Kandasamy’s comment that he will refrain from making hostile remarks against her, and added that ministers and elected members must also not accuse the territorial officials for following the rules and regulations strictly.

 Kandasamy on Saturday told reporters he had decided not to make any hostile remarks against Bedi. However, the minister accused the finance secretary of rejecting the government’s welfare proposals, and held the official responsible for influencing Bedi through his comments on the files.
 
 Bedi, while welcoming the attitudinal change in the minister, said he must realise all the appointed public servants have to fulfill their responsibilities in such a manner that no auditor can find fault. “If not, they (public servants) will be asked to explain the violation of rules. By the time, political representatives may have moved on elsewhere. The files may not even have the recorded approvals of their minister concerned, but may have given only verbal orders, which cannot be proven by the public officials during inquiry,” she pointed out.
