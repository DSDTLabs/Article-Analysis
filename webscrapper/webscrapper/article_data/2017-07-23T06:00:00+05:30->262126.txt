" Vaadu Trump typee. Eppudu ela react avuthado teliyadu," remarks   describing Goutham Nanda’s character in the film’s trailer. Loose translation: He is like Donald Trump, you never know how he will react in any situation. Ask   about the funny Trump analogy, and he says, “I play a billionaire, who has an eccentric streak about him. The film is based on a journey of self exploration that he sets out on. My character has dual shades to him; it is a unique concept that is told in a completely commercial manner.” 

 Hansika and Catherine Tresa play the leading ladies in the film directed by   Nandi. Gopi sounds quite pleased with the way the film has shaped up. “Sampath delivered 
 exactly on what he had promised initially and that’s all I ask for. Incidentally, he got the idea for   after reading a book written by Ramana Maharishi (19th century spiritual guru), and the underlying philosophical curve of the film is something that everyone can relate to,” says Gopichand adding, “After watching Goutham Nanda, everyone will feel the need to introspect at one level or the other. But having said that, the message is told subtly without compromising on the entertainment quotient.” 
 
 In keeping with his image, Goutham Nanda has a generous dose of breathtaking stunts. In fact the actor underwent training to perform a ‘sky diving’ sequence shot in Dubai and a gravity-defying bike stunt. “There are four action sequences in the film that will be a treat for the audience. We worked very hard for them and they turned out brilliantly,” says Gopi, who seems to be happy playing the action hero onscreen. 
 “By God’s grace, I have got this image. Why would I want to compromise on that just to reach out to a wider audience at the expense of my image which is my strength?” asks Gopi, signing off. 
 
  Produced by   and J Pullarao under Sri Balaji Cine Media banner, Goutham Nanda is releasing on July 28.
