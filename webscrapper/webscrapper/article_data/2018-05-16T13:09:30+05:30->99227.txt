VADODARA: A proposal by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) suggesting the inclusion of the   and Ecosystem Rejuvenation Project (VRERP) in the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) has been taken up by the state government. The state government has sought an assurance from the civic body regarding its share of the cost of the project.

 VMC had in October last year written to the state government stating that the VRERP proposal should be included under NRCP, a project of the central government. Since even the state government contributes to the projects under NRCP, such projects are routed through it.
 
 As per NRCP guidelines, if a project is selected, the central government bears 60 per cent of the cost, 30 per cent is borne by the state government while 10 per cent has to be borne by the civic body. The project funding is provided over a period of four years.
 
 While the exact amount of funding needed for the VRERP is yet to be finalised, it is estimated that around Rs 800crore will be spent on the project. Going by these estimates, the civic body will have to arrange for around Rs 80crore funding over a period of four years amounting to an average of Rs 20crore a year.
 
 The state governmentâ€™s urban development and urban housing department has recently sent a letter to the VMC that before sending the proposal for NRCP, the VMC should give an assurance to the state government that it will bear its share of expenses. The VMC administration has now sought an approval from the standing committee in this regard.
 
 If the standing committee gives a nod for taking up the expenses, the administration will give a written assurance to the state government. The proposal can then be forwarded to the central government.
