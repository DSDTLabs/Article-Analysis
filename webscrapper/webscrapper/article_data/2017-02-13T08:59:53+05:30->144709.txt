KOLHAPUR: The   corporators will lend their support to Shiv Sena’s leader of house Niyaz Khan for the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation's ( ) transport committee elections.

 The transport committee election is scheduled for Monday and considering the numbers, Khan is likely to be elected as chairman of the committee. The   (BJP)-Tararani Aghadi alliance has nominated   for the post. However, considering the lack of numbers, Kusale's may not get elected.
 
 The Sena had abstained from voting while electing the mayor as it was reluctant to openly support Congress-NCP and owing to the local differences, it did not support the BJP.
 
 A senior Congress leader said, “Sena members in the standing committee voted for our party candidate during crucial election. We had one member less as the member had aligned with the opposition camp. The nomination of Khan is to reciprocate the help extended by Sena members in the standing committee.”
 
 For the first in the history of KMC such an alliance has taken place where Shiv Sena — having just four corporators in the civic body — has got an opportunity to enter into power equations. As per the post-election arrangement, the post of chairman of the transport committee was to be shared between Congress and   for equal period for tenure of five years.
 
 After the resignation of Congress leader Lala Bhosale, it was the turn of an NCP candidate to hold the post. However, the understanding between both party's senior leaders paved way for Khan.
 
 The chairman of the transport committee is entitled to draft the budget for the transport service provided to the public, conduct weekly meetings with officials and track improvement in the service.
