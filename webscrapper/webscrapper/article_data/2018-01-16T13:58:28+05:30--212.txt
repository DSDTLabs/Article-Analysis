 The party members also displayed posters of pollution reaching dangerous levels in  .
 
 Upadhyay said that industries and environment minister   has not paid heed to pollution menace in Raipur which has been ranked among the top seven polluted cities in the world by   (WHO). Taking a dig at Munat, Upadhyay said, "Munat is minister for public works department, environment and industries- and all the departments complement each other for increasing the pollution. But in the last fourteen years of BJP government, the levels of polluted air has only increased and left people coughing. Hence, we have protested by doing yoga and wearing mask to send out a message about how dangerous it is to breathe in the city.
 
 On RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's visit to Raipur, Upadhyay said that BJP and   have been saying 'Yog kare swastha rahein' (Do yoga and be healthy). I would like to convey this message to RSS chief that he shouldn't do Yoga in Raipur else he too would suffer from lung disease as the air is too polluted to perform yoga here, else wear a mask.
 
 Earlier, as part of red alert campaign, district Congress members had distributed masks to people participating in Sehatmandi programme of Raipur Municipal Corporation (RMC).
