Then, police used some sort of material to turn it into a temporary shelter. Now, they have raised walls. The walls have been  ," a   official, who did not wish to be identified, told TOI.

 Charminar MLA   landed at the location and claimed police have not sought permission to carry out the construction. “Archaeological Survey of India ( ) does not give permission to construct structures near Charminar," he told TOI. He also objected to the fact that construction was done on the footpath.
 
 ASI officials said they would take stock of the situation on Friday.
