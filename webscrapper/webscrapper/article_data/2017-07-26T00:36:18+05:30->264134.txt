Trichy: The much-awaited project to streamline the flow of sewage water in the city will soon become a reality with the civic body ready to implement the underground drainage ( ) system in 26 wards.

 Ward numbers 8, 9, 12 in Srirangam zone; 7, 14, 15, 21, 27, 28 and 29 in Ariyamangalam zone; 30, 31, 46, 61, 62, 63,64 and 65 in Golden Rock zone and 52, 53, 54, 57, 58, 59 and 60 in Ko Abhishekapuram zone will be equipped with UGD under the second phase of the project, said special officer and corporation commissioner N Ravichandran on Tuesday. 
 
 He said that the civic body has received approval from the state government to implement the project at a cost of Rs 344 crore under AMRUT scheme. A private concern Voyants Private Limited has been awarded the contract for laying the UGD in the areas. 
 
 “In order to improve the sanitation in the city and maintain cleanliness, the government has given approval for the project. The wards covered in the project will have the full benefits of UGD,” said Ravichandran. 
 
 Under the project, sewage water pipelines for 318 km, main sewage pumping pipelines for 22km and four pumping stations will be laid, besides providing UGD connections to 39,849 residences in the 26 wards. 
 
 The 65 wards of the corporation spread across 167.23 square kilometers have a total population of 9,16,857. The civic body had provided UGD connections to 42,851 households under the various schemes of state and central governments many years ago. The rest of the areas remained without UGD, forcing the people to release the sewage water into normal sewage canal which is linked to water canals like Uyyakondan river. In most of the areas, the sewage water was let into vacant plots or it stagnated near the house and resulted in breeding of mosquitoes. 
 
 The corporation also said that the work to lay UGD in the left out areas of Srirangam zone was on the verge of completion. The government had allotted Rs 24 crore under the first phase. 
 
 The present phase of the project to cover 26 wards is expected to be complete in 2019 after which the third phase will commemnce at a estimated cost of Rs 450 crore.
