JAIPUR: Police are on alert after various organizations called for a   on April 10 to protest against the violence that erupted during the SC/ST Bharat   on April 2. 

 Sources said that adequate security arrangements will also be made as Shree Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena has called for a massive rally in the city on April 9 to voice their host of demands including reservation for upper castes.
 
 Leaders of a group called “Sarv Samaj,” an amalgamation of different caste groups like Jats, Gujjars, Brahmins and Rajputs, etc, held a press conference in the city on Saturday and called for a nationwide shut down on April 10. 
 
 The organization has also formed a special committee for the Bharat Bandh, “April 10 Bharat Bandh Sangharsh Samiti”.
 
 “Our call is not against reservation or a particular community, but the violence that erupted on April 2 during Bharat Bandh was unfortunate. A police sub-inspector, Mahendra Singh Choudhary in Jodhpur and a youth Pawan Kumar in Alwar were killed in the violence,” said Bhim Singh, one of the organisers.
 
 In another development, Shree Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena’s president Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi claimed that he will organise a massive rally in the city on Monday against the several demands including reservations for upper castes.
 
 “I am expecting over 30,000 people to take part in the rally. More people may join in after the horrible incidents that took place on April 2 in Rajasthan. We are also conducting a yagna to wake up this government against our plight,” Gogamedi said.
 
 Additional commissioner of police (law and order)   told TOI that the city police are prepared for all circumstances.
 
 Rajsthan police had initially claimed that call for Bharat Bandh on April 10 was mere rumour on social media, however, the Saturday’s press conference about Bharat Bandh has puzzled senior officials.
 
 ‘There is no face or a central committee, but we will keep a close eye on the events as they progress,” an official said.
