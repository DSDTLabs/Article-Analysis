NAGPUR: The Dinkar Zoting commission probing into allegations of illegal land transfer by former revenue minister   on Friday disposed of one of the two applications moved by him, while the second plea would be taken up on Monday.

 The commission dismissed the application moved by Khadse which had sought that two key witnesses — Pune district collector   and  , the then CEO of   (MIDC) — be recalled.
 
 The commission was of the opinion that there was no need to recall the two officers since the applicant’s purpose was to show that they had endorsed a specific document.
 
 On the other application of Khadse seeking reconstitution of issues before the commission, judge Zoting reserved his pronouncement till Monday when the exact status of the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed in Bombay high court main bench is ascertained.
 
 Arguing for the reconstitution of issues, senior counsel M   had raised the matter of PIL. 
 
 On Thursday, he argued that when the petition pending before the high court was dealing with matters related to ownership of the Bhosari land in question and whether it was ever acquired by the government for the MIDC, the commission would be overstepping its jurisdiction.
