HYDERABAD: The Telangana government has introduced an   system for transporting goods across the country effective February 1, principal secretary of commercial taxes,  , said on Thursday. He said that the new system was the second milestone in the Goods and   (GST) regime. This is the single bill applicable for the entire country.

 However, later in the evening, there were reports that the e-waybill system experienced technical glitches leading to the deferment of the introduction of the system from Thursday. When asked about it, Kumar told TOI: "We are not aware of any technical glitches. The e-waybill system has been launched and if we face any technical glitches, we will revert to the old system till they are rectified." 
 
 Addressing a press conference on Thursday, he said that the new system would help the state government access a database that would monitor the movement of goods from one state to another. He added that e-waybill becomes mandatory for transport of taxable goods exceeding a value of Rs 50,000. It is also mandatory for goods sent for job work from one state to another, irrespective of the value of the consignment transported.
 
 Kumar termed January 2018 as the best month post-GST. "While the state government got Rs 1,493 crore in December 2017, it has earned Rs 1,656 crore in January 2018," he said.
 
 He also said that 14,000 notices were served on traders who did not file their GST returns and Rs 1.19 crore collected as penalty. The government will impose 100% penalty on tax evaders, he added. Commercial taxes commissioner   said that e-waybill is a single bill and useful for all traders.
