RANCHI:  , Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali will be the   in the city to do away with   

 Following the guidelines of the central board of secondary education (CBSE), JVM has come up with the plan to get rid of school bags for children in nursery and preparatory classes from the next academic year.
 
 Principal AK Singh said, "CBSE guidelines say that the bags for students up to class one should be made as light as possible. We are implementing it for the junior classes this year and will do the same for class one, the next year."
 
 "The children will have to carry only a lunch box and a water bottle to school every day. They will be given the facility to keep their books and notebooks in classroom itself for which they will be allotted cupboards. They will have to carry a book or notebook home only if it's necessary," said Singh.
 
 The principal also said that parents would be directed to give only half a litre water bottle to their children. "We do not want children to carry heavy weight, as it effects their health. Parents need not worry as we have water filters and coolers installed across the school premises so the children would not have to face a crisis of drinking water," he said.
 
 Nursery and preparatory are not the classes for academic burden. Singh said, "Parents have to understand that nursery and preparatory classes are meant to train children and teach them to stay away from home for a few hours. They should not be burdened unnecessarily."
