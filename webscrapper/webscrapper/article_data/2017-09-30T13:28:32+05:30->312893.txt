The dream for 'Sex and the City 3' movie is over, unfulfilled.   has squashed the reports that said a third movie of the franchise was in the process of making.

  
  
  "It's over,"   said, in an interview adding, "We're not doing it." The 52-year-old said she was "disappointed" about the news herself. "I'm disappointed. We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story," she continued.
 
  "It's not just disappointing that we don't get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie." It comes after Parker and her two other co-stars,   and Cynthia Nixon, had apparently all signed up for the same upfront fee in order to have one more outing as the loveable and lustful Manhattan socialites.
 
  The series, which went off the air in 2004, revolved around Parker's character,  , and her core group of girlfriends who navigate life and love in New York. It spawned two feature films, 'Sex and the City' (2008) and its sequel 'Sex and the City 2' (2010).
