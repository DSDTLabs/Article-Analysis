DARBHANGA/PATNA: One Ramchandta Yadav was killed in an attack by armed miscreants on the family of BJP worker   (41), who had renamed Bhadwa Chowk as   Chowk a couple of years back, in Balha village under the Sadar police station area in   district on Thursday night. 

 The 70-year-old deceased was Tej’s father. Police have arrested Dilip Mahto (32), Devendra Kumar Yadav (22) and Ramsevak Yadav (45), who were named in an FIR lodged by Tej’s wife Shushila Devi in the Sadar police station on Friday.
 
 Quoting the FIR, a police officer attributed the attack to an old   between Tej’s family members and their relatives, who were reported to be RJD supporters. However, the officer denied reports doing the rounds on the social media that the attackers wanted to rename   to Lalu Chowk.
 
 Besides naming the trio, the FIR has also made “unknown people” accused. Sadar police station SHO Ravishankar Prasad said raids were on to nab others.
 
 According to the SHO, Tej runs a tea stall at Bhadwa Chowk. A Narendra Modi supporter, he put up a board at the intersection, announcing its renaming as Modi Chowk in 2016.
 
 Tej had a heated argument with four youths near his shop around 8pm on Thursday. “Hours later, at least one dozen people armed with hockey sticks and iron rods attacked his house. Even as Tej and his four brothers resisted them, their father came out and received a fatal blow on his head,” the SHO said and reiterated Sushila in her FIR had not referred to any dispute over the renaming of the intersection.
