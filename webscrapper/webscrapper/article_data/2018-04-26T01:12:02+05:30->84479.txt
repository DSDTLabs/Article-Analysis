One look at the   records of K Madhapur in Sulur block in Coimbatore and it is very hard to ignore how several   were created and   put into the records to siphon off extra money.

 For instance, there was a job card with number 554 in the name of Thulasiammal, aged 48, wife of Chinnapalani, resident of No 41, K Madhapur. But another job card was issued in the name of Thulasiammal, wife of Chinnapalani, bearing number 554 (a) in the same address. But the second card mentions Thulasiammal’s age as 55.
 
 It was not Chinnapalani alone with `multiple wives’ in the village, according to the panchayat records. There were other men too, who had multiple wives with the same name, though of different ages. The job card data showed that Senthil Kumar in address 4/70, Amman nagar, K Madhapur has wife named Lalitha, 31. There was another job card, with his wife’s name as Lalitha, but aged 30.
 
 Officials in DRDA when asked about this said that several fake cards were weeded out and some bank accounts were frozen. This is not it. There were several double entries in the muster too showed the same person working on two projects on the same day, at the same time and drawing wages for both the work.
 
 In most cases, all these workers are illiterate and they are not even aware of the money that they are supposed to get under the scheme. C Raayatha, 65, said she was given Rs 80 in 2012 and 2013 when, as per norms, she was supposed to get more than Rs 100. "Rs 20 per worker is taken out as commission by the officials," said K Mayilsamy, a BJP functionary.
 
 Villages such as Malumichampatti in Madhukkarai block and Nanjundapuram in P N Palayam block have recorded similar irregularities, said officials.
