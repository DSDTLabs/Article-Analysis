  : The All Tawang District Students' Union (ATDSU) has demanded that the state government constitute a committee for verification of Tibetan refugees in Tawang district who are allegedly availing benefits of both ST certificates and refugee cards. The ATDSU has been spearheading ' ', a movement to evict all 'illegal settlers' from Tawang. 

 "Tawang is in danger from outsiders. Indigenous rights are in danger," said Operation Clean Drive chairman   in a press conference on Wednesday.
 
 Tsering said there are 199 refugee card holders in the district as per official records but inclusions as per directives of the state government since 2002 have taken their actual number to more than 1000. "The state government had issued a directive to the gaon burahs of Shyo village to issue ST certificates on the basis of the genealogical tree prepared on the basis of an agreement made in 1936. Accordingly, 90 families were issued ST certificates," he said.
 
 To back up the claim of refugee card holders also availing benefits of ST certificates, Tsering claimed three Arunachal   (APPSC) aspirants who were recently selected in the medical officer (allopathy) examination under the ST quota - Sonam Tsomu, Sonam Dolma and Pema Dolma - come from a family which had no mention in the list of 90 families. Their ST certificates are fake, alleged Tsering. Demanding immediate cancellation of their candidatures after verification, he said they have written to the APPSC in this regard and the commission has asked Tawang DC to verify the claims.
