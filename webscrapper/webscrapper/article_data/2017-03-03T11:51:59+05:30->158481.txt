GORAKHPUR: BJP national president   said during a road show here on Thursday that the people of the state are fed up with the caste-based and appeasement politics in UP. He exuded confidence that his party will form the next government. Shah was leading but it was   who stole the show. 

 The 6-km roadshow started around an hour late. Shah ended his speech at Vijay Chauraha in mere two three sentences as the campaigning time ended. 
 
 On the last day of campaigning for the sixth phase of the  , the BJP workers were charged up. They raised slogans during the around three-and-a-half hour road show. Most of the time they were shouting slogans in favour of Yogi Adityanath. 'UP dol raha hai, Yogi Yogi Bol raha hai', 'Gorakhpur mein rehna hai to Yogi Yogi kehna hai', apart from 'Jai Sri Ram, Bharat Mata ki jai and Vandematram'. Many women in the road show were found in sarees with lotus sign.
 
 Shah said: "I thank you all for your immense support. The people of the state are fed up of caste-based and appeasement politics. We'll form a majority government." Due to the late start and time constraint, the road show was not taken to the pre-planned route and missed places like Golghar, Ganesh Chauraha, Collectorate Chowk and Shastri Chowk. the Shah mounted on truck decorated with marigold and passed through many Muslim populated areas but there was no sign of protest.
 
 As soon as convoy reached Ghasikatra, a Hindu funeral procession came across. The people took as an auspicious sign. Accompanied by local MP Yogi Adityanath and BJP state incharge Om Prakash Mathur, Shah passed though the narrow lanes of the city amid heavy security.
