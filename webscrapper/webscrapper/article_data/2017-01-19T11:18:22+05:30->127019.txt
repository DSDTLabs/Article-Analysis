NASHIK: A speeding multi-axle truck tore the side of a city   and knocked down a two-wheeler at Adgaon Naka on Wednesday, leaving six people injured. All the   have been admitted to various private hospitals.

 The truck coming from Ozar and going towards Nashik city tore the rear end of the driver’s side of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus that was at the cross-road at Adgaon village, on the outskirts of Nashik city. 
 
 “The bus was going towards Ozar and was waiting at the divider when the truck dashed it before turning sideways,” inspector Sanjay Sanap of Adgaon police station said. 
 
 Five passengers in the bus were injured in the mishap. A motorcyclist from the village, who was also crossing the highway, was knocked down by the truck.
 
 The cross-roads between KK Wagh College and Adgaon village are infamous for accidents mainly because of the heavy traffic movement on the Dhule-Pune national highway (earlier known as Mumbai-Agra national highway) that divides the densely populated areas of Panchavati.
 
 “For a long time, residents of the areas on either side of the road have been demanding flyovers across the highway, which is very busy in the peak hours, leading to traffic jams for hours together. Now, the flyover has been sanctioned. Had it been done earlier, a good number of lives and property would have been saved,” said Anita Sharma, a local resident.
