 The Congress chief minister, however, reminded Badal that "the previous Congress government policy in this regard allowed for government accommodation to former chief ministers was revoked by Akalis". Amarinder said he had learnt that Badal was hunting for a suitable accommodation after demitting the chief minister’s office following his party's defeat in the recent assembly elections.
 
 "The SAD leader will get an official residence of his liking to stay till the time he desires" a Congress government statement said. It pointed out that the existing policy does not provide for official residence to former chief ministers in the state.

Amarinder had fought against Badal in Lambi but was defeated by the SAD warhorse by 22,770 votes. Badal polled 66,375 votes while Amarinder Singh secured 43,605 votes. AAP candidate Jarnail Singh was at the third spot, securing 21,254 votes.
