Sivaganga: A 30-year-old man, his wife and two-year-old child were found dead near Singampunari in Sivaganga district. Police suspect that the man might have murdered his wife and son before committing suicide. While a case was registered, an investigation is underway to find the reason behind the crime.

 Police said P Muthupandi, 30, from M Kovilpatti was running an electrical shop in Singampunari. When Muthupandi’s parents, who left the house to visit a temple, returned in the noon, they found the house locked from inside. As there was no response, they peeped into the house only to find their son hanging. Shocked by this, they alerted the neighbours, who informed the local police. The door was broke open to gain entry. Muthupandi’s wife M Priya, 25, was found dead with a stab injury on the neck, whereas his son Sowmiya Narayanan was found dead with froth in the mouth.
 
  However, there was no conclusive information on why Muthupandi could have commited such a crime.
