NAGPUR: It was a mixed luck for   in the 68th Maharashtra U-18 State Inter-District Junior Basketball Championship being held at the   near Pune on Wednesday.

 While city girls stormed into the semifinals, boys suffered a heart-breaking two-point defeat to bow out of the competition in the quarterfinal.
 
 Nagpur district girls overcame a tough challenge from unfancied Dhule before registering a hard-fought 65-52 win in the quarter. City lasses started strongly and were leading by 18-6 at the end of the first quarter. However, Dhule bounced back gallantly and claimed the next two quarters (19-12, 19-15) to reduce the deficit to just one point (44-45).
 
 One of the title favourites, Nagpur girls arrested the slide and bounced back in the fourth and last quarter (20-8) to shatter the hopes of their opponents with a 13-point victory.
 
 Once again it was Shreya Dandekar, who stole the show with 16 points. She got valuable support from Rasika Pande, Siddha Deshmukh (12 each) and Abha Lad (9).
 
 For Dhule,   (21) and Sanika Shinkar (12) did well but lacked support from others.
 
 While Nagpur girls escaped to victory, boys crashed to a painful 54-56 defeat at the hands of Mumbai Central. After winning the first quarter narrowly at 19-18, Nagpur lads faltered in the second and lost tamely 6-16 to trail by 25-34 at the half time. Although, Nagpur tried to catch up by dominating the third quarter (17-9) they still could not take the lead (42-43).
 
 The fourth and final quarter was a nail-biting affair with both the teams trying hard for each and every basket. Mumbai Central managed to keep their nerves in the pressure situations and notched up a thrilling two-point win.
 
 Yash Jiwtode, Piyush Singh and Dhruv Dhabe all scored 11 points each but still could not prevent defeat for Nagpur. For the winners, Hitesh Bapna (13) and Shivam Mishra (12) were the heroes for Mumbai Central.
 
 Semifinals will be played on Thursday.
