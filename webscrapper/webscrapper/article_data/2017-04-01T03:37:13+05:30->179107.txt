BEIJING: Unable to block the upcoming visit of the Dalai   to  , China is now emphasising that India is committing a major mistake in allowing him to visit the border state.

 “This will have serious damage on bilateral relations (sic),” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson   warned on Friday. “China firmly opposes the Dalai Lama carrying out any activity in the relevant region and we have expressed our concerns to the Indian side,” he said.
 
 China’s protest highlights the dichotomy in its stand on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor where Chinese construction companies are building infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, a region claimed by India. Beijing says India need not worry about   work because it will not affect its policy on the Kashmir issue. “On the eastern section of the China-India border, China’s position is clear and constant. The Dalai clique has long been engaging in separatist activities with unglorious record (sic) … But despite this India still invited the Dalai Lama to visit the region,” Lu said.
