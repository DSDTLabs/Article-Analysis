PANAJI: The directorate of mines and geology has asked panchayats to create awareness about the availability of Rs 180 crore in district mineral foundation funds (DMFF), and to take up projects. The move came after the high court of Bombay at Goa expressed shock and concern over the governmentâ€™s apathy in utilising the funds. 

 Mines director   said that all panchayats must put up notices in their offices to inform the public about the DMFF, available through projects recommended by panchayats or gram sabhas, which can be undertaken by the respective DMFF. The communique from Acharya came after specific directions from the high court. 
 
 The corpus can be utilised for a variety of welfare activities such as restoring the ecology, providing healthcare, education, education, building roads and bridge networks, desilting of water bodies, installing pollution control devices, constructing sewage treatment plants, providing assistance in agriculture, horiculture, dairy farming and animal husbandry. 
 
 The DMFF has been established in both districts in the state to work for the interest and benefit of persons and areas affected by mining-related operations.
 
 A total of Rs 180.3 crore has been collected from both districts, of which Rs 93.8 crore is from   and Rs 86.5 crore from South Goa. Acharya said that the funds can be spent for purposes specified under the   Rules, 2016.
 
 The Goa District Mineral Foundation Rules, 2016, came into force on January 12, 2015. However, both the north and south district foundations were only notified on December 7, 2017. 
 
 The court had passed a series of orders, the last one on March 7, this year, to ensure drinking water to Sonshi and also to lay a pipeline for supply.
