GHAZIABAD: An 18-year-old girl has been booked for culpable homicide after she allegedly   her mother with a blunt object on the   during a quarrel on Friday, causing her death.

 The girl, who fled home in   here leaving her mother in a pool of blood, was booked under Section 304 of IPC after her father Satish Kumar lodged a complaint at Kavi Nagar police station.
 
 Satish, a 44-year-old goods transporter, has apparently told the police that the two had been fighting over his daughter’s relationship with a   teacher of the school where she studied. 
 
 Sources said the girl had earlier left home in September last year — when she was still a minor — to live with the teacher (35) at a rented accommodation in  . She was eventually brought back home on January 28 after her father lodged a police complaint accusing the teacher of luring her daughter away.
 
 The accused girl is the elder of Satish’s two daughters.
 
 Satish had been away at work and his younger daughter at school when the quarrel started between his wife and his elder daughter around 11am on Friday.
 
 “When my other daughter returned from school, she found my wife Pushpa lying on the floor and blood all over. My wife could barely speak, but told her she had been hit on the head by my elder daughter during a quarrel,” Satish said.
 
 “We took her to a private hospital nearby. They referred her to the GTB Hospital in Delhi, where she died. I have told police that the woman teacher could be involved in the murder. My daughter could not have committed the crime alone,” he added.
 
 An autopsy was conducted on the body in Delhi. “The woman had been attacked with a blunt and heavy object on the head. On the basis of allegations made by the girl’s family, we went to the teacher’s house. It was found locked. As of now, we are trying to find out the whereabouts of the teacher. All efforts are being made to nab the accused girl,” said Samarjeet Singh, SHO of Kavi Nagar police station.
