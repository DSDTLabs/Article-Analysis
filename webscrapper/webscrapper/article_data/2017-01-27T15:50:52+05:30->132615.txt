The Indian National Congress (INC), one of the major political parties of India, is hoping to make a comeback in Punjab with the upcoming Punjab assembly elections. Amarinder Singh, the Congress's de facto chief ministerial face, has already declared that this will be his last election. Singh is contesting from two seats â€” Patiala and Lambi, where he is locked in a triangular contest with Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal and AAP's Jarnail Singh. Cricketer turned politician Navjot Singh Sidhu has also joined Congress and will be contesting from the Amritsar East seat, a seat won by his wife Navjot Kaur in 2012 who like him recently left the BJP and joined Congress.  The state assembly elections in Punjab will be held on February 4, 2017 and the results will be announced on March 11, 2017.
