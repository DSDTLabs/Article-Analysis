MUMBAI: As Sikhs enjoy   festivities on Saturday, the  , Tamilian,   and   communities will celebrate their harvest festivals and new year this weekend.

 Bengalis in Shivaji Park plan to ring in Poila Boishakh on Sunday with a puja at the Kali Mandir located in the vast ground. A community dinner is planned Sunday night. “We traditionally open new books of account at Poila Boishakh although this exercise is more symbolic now. Since it is Sunday, I will cook our favourite fish, hilsa, in mustard, and mixed vegetables followed by either payesh or rasgullas,” said Kandivli resident Runa Chatterjee.
 
 The Navi Mumbai   Sangham will distribute buttermilk and panagam (a jaggery drink) at Puthandu or Vilambi new year Saturday, said secretary Rajasri Nagarajan. “On Sunday, we are hosting a musical orchestra by U K Murali at Vishnudas Bhave hall,” Nagarajan said. Tamilian households lay out an elaborate display of auspicious items on Puthandu. The centrepiece is a picture of Lord Krishna with fruits, rice, tur dal, jaggery, coins, gold and silver.
 
 The Malayalees’ Vishukani arrangement includes special golden-yellow flowers, coins, jewellery, jackfruit, mango, vegetables and a metal mirror placed before Lord Krishna. “This is the first sight we glimpse on Vishu day. Both households and temples lay out the Vishukani,” said Upendra Menon, national vice president of the All India Malayalee Association. —Bella Jaisinghani
