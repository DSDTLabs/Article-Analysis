 A three-member team of the central government will be arriving in the city on Friday to review ground realities. For the next three days, the team members will visit various spots and interact with NGOs, common men and give marks to the civic body for its steps taken to make the city clean. The team’s finding will decide the ranking of the city under the Swachh Bharat Mission.
 
 Last year, the city was ranked 53 out of 70. The ranking was based on various parameters like steps to eradicate practice of open defecation and solid waste management.

 Under the mission, the state government has set a target of building 11,997 toilets as per the city’s population. But so far, the authorities could complete construction of less than 3,000 toilets.
