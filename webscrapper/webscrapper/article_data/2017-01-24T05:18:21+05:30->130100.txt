New Delhi: Only one online application per candidate will be accepted for the forthcoming   admission, an official said.

 Last year over 3.5 lakh candidates registered for various undergraduate courses, of which nearly 30,000 filed more than one application. In order to avoid such a situation, the admission committee, which is deliberating on the new admission policy for 2017-18, is also working towards making   mandatory for the registration process.
 
 The reason for filling multiple forms are diverse. “While filling the online form if the connection crashes, many candidates fill a second form. Many do it to rectify their mistakes, while others want to be doubly sure,” an official, who is also a member of the admission committee, said.
 
 To avoid such duplicity the university will allow only one application per candidate and a window will be given during which they can rectify their mistakes and submit again, the official said. The procedure, however, is at the recommendation stage and the administration are yet to take a final call, he added.
 
 Another official said linking of Aadhaar number will help in declaration of results and issuing of certificates online as well as providing other facilities like disbursement of scholarships.
 
 However, making it mandatory will also cause problems to those from the northeast as most of them don’t have Aadhaar cards yet.
 
 “To get an Aadhaar card we have to travel to district headquarters. Very few have them. It should not be made mandatory for aspirants from northeast region,” said Chinglen Khumukcham of North-East Forum for International Solidarity.
 
 “Every decision will be taken considering all the section of the society. The admission committee will deliberate on this issue so that that the admission process is fair,” said Yogesh Tyagi,  .
