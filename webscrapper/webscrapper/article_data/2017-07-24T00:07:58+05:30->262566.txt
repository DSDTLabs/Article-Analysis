The   Marathi names on   were installed on Uran road and Thana Naka road. The signages with mistakes are that for Tapal naka,   court, Senior Citizen Hall and an indicator for Panvel bus stop. The errors were spotted by citizens and activists with most of them going viral on social media. Few posted the wrong signages by encircling the misspellings.
 
 Blaming the PCMC for the goof up, MMRDA contractors claimed that they had got the misspelled names from the Panvel civic body. However, the PCMC defaulted the contracting firms for the goof-up. Now, the signages have been removed for correction. 
 
 A MMRDA contractor staff said the names had been provided by the Panvel civic body. PCMC engineer Sanjay Katekar said, “The MMRDA contractors had taken the names from us. They have made the mistake and have started removing the signages.”
 
 However, activist Bharat Jadhav alleged, “The possibility of PCMC giving the wrong names to MMRDA cannot be ruled out. Now they are blaming the MMRDA contractors in the wake of the public outburst. This should be probed.”
