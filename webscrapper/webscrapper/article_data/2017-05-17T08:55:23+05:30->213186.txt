NEW DELHI: The   (ITPO) will auction 3.7 acres prime land in   to raise funds for building the country’s biggest exhibition-cum-convention centre. The money will be used to build a 500-room hotel for guests.

 Announcing this, ITPO chief L C Goyal said that the project would require Rs 2,250 crore. ITPO will pump in about Rs 1,200 crore. “The Cabinet has approved that we can raise institutional loan from banks and financial institutions. We have about 3.7 acre land, which we will be monetising. I personally feel that the successful bidder should get this land on freehold. But the decision will be taken by the Union Cabinet. We are moving a proposal seeking Cabinet nod,” he added.
 
 Goyal said another Rs 800 crore will be spent for overhaul of the road infrastructure and connectivity around Pragati Maidan. At least 80% of this amount will come from the urban development ministry.
 
 Sources said going by the past trends and the prevailing land rates ITPO may get more than Rs 500 crore from the sale of this parcel.   (NBCC), which is implementing the project, had auctioned three acre land in   to   at Rs 500 crore. Officials said the loan amount ITPO will raise from banks will depend on the amount it gets from auction of this land. 
 
 “Top companies have shown interest to undertake work. The bids will be out in the next one month,” said NBCC chief A K Mittal.
