MUMBAI: Final-year law students who have been shortlisted for   are now left in a quandary over   results. While Saturday is the last day for submission of LLM admission forms, results of many students are still held in reserve or they are awaiting revaluation owing to discrepancies.

 The unprecedented delay in the announcement of results and assessment glitches leading to students failing in one subject, when they have scored first class marks in the rest of the subjects, has caused mental trauma to the students, they claimed in a letter to the university. “We have asked the university to either allow provisional admission on the basis of marks in lower classes or to extend the admission deadline to accommodate eligible students,” said a law student. The students have made their representation to the university as they are worried about losing a year in the process.
 
 The university declared the result of the last semester of LLB/BLS, which was conducted in May, on August 30. On September 10, the institute released another set of results. tnn
