 Similarly, the roads and infrastructure department is slated to receive higher funding compared to what it got in the current fiscal. Funds for laying more than 800 km-long national highway roads as well as regional ring road projects will be earmarked in the budget. From the Rs 3,334 crore budgetary allocation in the current year, the department is expected to see a major jump in the allocations.Welfare schemes such as old age pensions, scholarships, marriage allowance to SC, BC and minorities, free health under Arogyasri programs are also slated to recieve more funds.
