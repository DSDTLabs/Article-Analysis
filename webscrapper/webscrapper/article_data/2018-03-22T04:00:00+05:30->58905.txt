Chennai: The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal filed by Yogendra Vasupal, co-founder of hotel and homestay aggregator Stayzilla. In a hearing on Wednesday, the two judge bench disposed Vasupal’s appeal, challenging the insolvency proceedings ordered by National Company Law Tribunal.

 “I stand vindicated. Wonder what the defaulters and their lobbyists will cry about now,” said Aditya GC Shekhar, CEO, JigSaw Solutions.
 
 Advertising agency JigSaw Solutions had initiated corporate insolvency proceedings against Stayzilla by approached the NCLT Chennai for unpaid dues of Rs 1.7 crore. 
 
 The dispute took centre stage in the startup scene weeks after Vasupal declared in February last year that he was suspending operations and working on a reboot of Stayzilla. Soon after, based on a complaint from Jigsaw, Vasupal was arrested by the police on counts of cheating. Vasupal was out on bail after a month in jail while cofounder Sachit Singhi got anticipatory bail. 
 
 He had taken to social media to draw attention to his plight, posting multiple blog posts about his arrest and subsequent intimidation. 
 
 Vasupal's experience proved a lesson for entrepreneurs in corporate governance and the dangers in vendor contracts. Vasupal and his lawyers were not available for a comment.
