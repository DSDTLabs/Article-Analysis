LUCKNOW:   Manpreet Singh Badal on Friday said his state was the first to ban the   or other ministers from displaying their names on   or edicts.

 He spoke to TOI during a visit to the state capital. 
 
 He also said that Punjab was the first state to shun the red beacon and other traditional protocol to ministers and officers, bringing an an end to VVIP culture followed by the Modi government. 
 
 Instead of names of ministers, foundation stones in Punjab would say from the ‘money of tax payers’. This would be a unique experiment by the Congress government of giving credit to the public for development, Badal said.
 
 “Since it is public money and (institutions) are built with their taxes, it is the moral duty of the state to give credit to the public,” Badal said, talking to TOI.
