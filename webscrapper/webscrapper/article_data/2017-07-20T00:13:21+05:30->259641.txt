A labour contractor was arrested by the Malad police on Wednesday on charges of molesting his 11-year-old daughter. According to the police, the accused committed the crime on two to three occasions. He would also watch   videos on his cellphone in her presence, an officer said.

 “The harassment had been going on for the past four to five months. When the girl, who is a school student, started staying aloof, her mother quizzed her. The girl then broke down and confided in her mother, who approached the police and registered a case on Tuesday,” said a police officer. The accused will be produced before a court in Thursday. tnn
