CHANDIGARH: Will Punjab voters better their own voting percentage record this time? While the   (EC) has been running campaigns to exhort voters to exercise their franchise, key political parties too are leaving no stone unturned to ensure that they do not lose by narrow margins in a three-corner fight this time.

 On Friday, chief electoral officer (CEO)   said based on the trends of past elections, it is hoped that voting time will touch the 85% mark. “An effort has been made to reach out to all sections of voters over the past few months,” he said.
 
 Punjab assembly elections in 2012 witnessed 78.57 % voting. Before this it was 65.14 % in 2002 and the voter turnout in Punjab assembly elections jumped to 75.45% in 2007. The poll percentage for women (79.10%) was higher than men (78.09%) in 2012. The voting percentage in assembly elections is more than Lok Sabha polls in the state and it was 70.04% in 2009 and 70.89% in 2014 general elections.
 
 The ECI has tried to target voters at both ends of the age spectrum. Where it has carried out voter registration drives in educational institutions, it has been decided to set up model polling booths so that there is easy access for the aged and differently abled.
 
 In 2012, the lowest victory margin was 31 of Avinash Chander of SAD against   of the Congress in Phillaur. In fact, there were at least ten seats where the victory margin was less than 1,000 votes and these included Ferozepur Rural, Jagraon (SC), Nihalsinghwala, Payal (SC), Fatehgarh Churian, Shutrana, Jalandhar Cantonment, and Kartarpur.
 
 The political parties have been running campaigns to reach out to voters. As part of its telecalling,   (AAP) reached 7 lakh voters in Punjab during the last two months to exhort people to cast their votes.
