NEW DELHI: A large segment of traders who are protesting against the government’s decision to reallocate tomato sheds at the   went on strike on Monday. 

  said that business of Rs 30-40 crore was hit as arrival of fruits and vegetables dropped significantly.
 
 The strike has been postponed after the government called the protesting traders for a meeting on Tuesday. “An official from the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) called us at 2pm and asked us to meet the development minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday. If our demands are accepted, we will call off the strike, else, we will go back on strike later this week,” said Metha Ram Kripalani, a trader.
 
 Sources said the supply of fruits was more affected than vegetables and over 90% of work at the mandi was held up. “We had informed the farmers about the strike, so most of them did not come here. A slight shortage may continue on Tuesday but, if we decide to call off the strike, the situation should stabilise by Wednesday,” said a trader.
 
 The reason for the unrest was a decision by the government to reallocate tomato sheds. A section of traders had complained to APMC about some unauthorised people who had occupied their sheds. 
 
 “APMC later issued showcause notices to these traders but the response was not satisfactory. So, teams have gone there on a couple of occasions to remove them but traders have threatened self-immolation. On Monday a final notice was issued and appropriate action will be taken soon,” said a senior official.
 
 Despite the eviction, government officials said, reallocation of sheds would still be done. “There is a cartel that needs to be broken. Allocation of sheds has always been a contentious issue. To bring about some order, we will have to carry our reallocation based on market fees paid by traders over the past three years. We have already asked for applications and the process has started,” said an APMC official.
