AMRITSAR: Several Indians, whose relatives died in Pakistan jails, have come out in support of Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian national who has been awarded death sentence for allegedly spying in Pakistan. They have appealed to the Union government to help him escape the gallows.

 “He is an innocent person and a businessman having links with Iran, but the Pakistan government implicated him in a false case to defame India,” said former Indian spy   while talking to TOI on Monday.
 
 Pankaj claimed that he was an Indian spy who was sent to Pakistan by the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in 1994 and was arrested in 2004, but was released by Pakistan government in 2016 in want of evidence. “I am admitting that I spied for India but in the same spirit I say that Kulbhushan was not a spy, but a businessman,” he said.
 
 The Inter-Services Public Relations ( ) of Pakistan had released a confessional video statement of Jadhav where he is shown to have admitted fomenting terrorism in Balochistan and Karachi. He was arrested on March 3, 2016 and was charged for spying and carrying out disruptive activities.
 
 The field general court martial under the Pakistan Army Act had awarded Kulbhushan death for his alleged involvement in “spying and subversive activities.”
 
 Meanwhile, Dalbir Kaur, sister of slain Indian prisoner  , who died after being attacked in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail, said, “I had earlier warned the Indian government that it should react quickly before it was too late.”
 
 Saying that it was still not too late to stop Jadhav’s execution, Dalbir said the government should move the   (ICJ) or she would move the court to stay the death sentence of Jadhav.
 
 Jagir Kaur, sister of another slain Indian prisoner Kirpal Singh, said it was the most unfortunate incident. She blamed the Pakistani government for doing injustice to the Indian prisoners. “Pakistan will not let Indian prisoners go back home alive. It has been doing it time and again,” she said.
