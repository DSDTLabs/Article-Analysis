Gurgaon: Two people have been arrested in   Phase 1 for possession of   notes. 

 According to police, the accused, identified as Kaptan Singh, Romi Singh and Bittu, had visited   in DT Mega Mall on Monday night for a party. When handed a bill of Rs 8,900, the trio made the payment in cash. They paid Rs 5,100 in 100 -rupee notes. The cashier raised an alarm that the 100 rupee notes were fake. The trio was questioned.
