In the biggest points gain for the   on a   day ever, the index jumped 486 points (1.8%) on Tuesday, riding on the government’s resolve for fiscal discipline and economic reforms and the relief announced for taxpayers. The sensex ended the day at 28,142 — a three-month high. Foreign investors, however, were muted in their response to the Budget. Their net buying of stocks was worth Rs 93 crore, while bullish domestic funds recorded a net inflow figure of Rs 1,134 crore. The day’s rally was led by auto and banking & financial sector stocks, while IT and pharma continued to witness selling pressure due to emerging business hurdles in the US, the largest export market for these companies.

 The day’s gains, which made investors richer by over Rs 1.7 lakh crore with BSE’s current market capitalisation now at nearly Rs 114 lakh crore, were also boosted by short covering by speculators who had gone short, anticipating a tough   for the market in particular.
 
 Brokers and fund managers said some of the FM’s proposals signalled that India is open for business. “The Budget clearly affirms India’s commitment to globalisation and an open market against a global trend of protectionism. The abolition of FIPB is a strong signal towards the same, as is the clarification on tax on indirect transfer,” said Leo Puri, MD, UTIMF.
 
 Brokers also feel that the government’s tax proposals are a long-term positive for the market. “The proposed reduction in tax will be constructive for improving overall compliance and collection efficiency. This will also be positive for greater flow of savings to formal channels and towards various alternative investment avenues including capital markets,” said Shilpa Kumar, MD & CEO, ICICI Securities.
