Indore: People caught littering the streets who refuse to pay spot fines levied on them will have to appear before a court if they refuse to pay fines.

 Civic body officials said the system will be similar to that followed by the traffic police department where once the vehicle is seized, a notice from the court is sent to the violator’s residence and they have to appear before the court.
 
 “We have a municipal magistrate in the court and we can follow the same procedure, the minimum penalty issued by the court will be Rs 5000,” said Manish Singh, commissioner, IMC.
 
 Officials of the civic body said that the penalty levied will depend on the amount of garbage that the violator has dumped.
 
 “If the garbage is not disposed properly, the civic body has to send vehicles and people to the spot where garbage is thrown. The fine depends on the cost incurred by IMC in the process,” Singh said.
 
 The civic body has gone all out in running drives on cleanliness. Fines are issued to violators on a daily basis. IMC officials had fined some people a week ago for leaving construction material lying on a road.
 
 Five renowned coaching institutes were on Tuesday fined Rs 5,000 for littering roads with pamphlets they would distribute. Several challans have also been issued to marriage gardens and marriage processions in the last one week.
 
 The civic body has also kept a constant check on shopkeepers who do not follow norms. The shopkeepers have been instructed to ensure they keep two dustbins at their establishments and throw the waste only in garbage collection vehicles.
 
 “We have attained the number one position in the cleanliness survey. We have to take extra effort to maintain this position. The drive in the city will continue with the same pace and action will be taken against anyone found guilty of littering in any manner,” Singh said.
