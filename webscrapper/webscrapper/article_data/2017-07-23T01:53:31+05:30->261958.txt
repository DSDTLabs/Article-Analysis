NEW DELHI: Four girls living at a shelter home,  , escaped from their room with the help of dupattas and left the premises in the early hours of Saturday. However, a police official outside the   saw them escaping and caught hold of three girls. The fourth girl, who had apparently planned the entire escape, managed to escape and is yet to be traced.

 Police said that the matter came to fore at 1.40 am, when a cop who was posted near the shelter home noticed three girls running into a dark area and a man chasing them. He rushed to see what the matter was and was told by the guard who was chadsing them that the girls were trying to escape. He then caught hold of the girls and made a PCR call, as all of them were injured. 
 
 They were taken to a hospital and given treatment. Two of them were discharged whereas the third girl got a fracture in her back and is still in the hospital.
 
 The two girls told police that the fourth girl, who managed to escape, had been telling them stories of men escaping from a house where they were confined which excited them.
 
 They all tried coming down one after the other, without waiting for the one before them to reach down first. Due to this, the ties opened and the girls fell while they were midway and sustained injuries. DCP (southeast), Romil Baniya, said that they have registered a case.
 
 “All the girls who tried to escape have done it before too, just not in our shelter home,” said Vishwajeet Ghoshal, director at Prayas.
