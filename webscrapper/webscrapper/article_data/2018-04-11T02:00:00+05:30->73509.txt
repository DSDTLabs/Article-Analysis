PATNA: The ‘Bharat bandh’ supporters manhandled Union minister and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) chief   at Nauma village on Hajipur-Mahua road in Vaishali district on Tuesday morning when he was on way to Motihari to attend PM Narendras Modi’s meeting.

 They also made ‘casteist’ remarks against   and called him ‘pro-reservationist’, RLSP state general secretary   said. He said the matter would be presented before the national leadership of the NDA. RLSP is a part of the BJP-led NDA. 
 
 “What has happened is condemnable,” is what state   president and Ujiarpur MP Nityanand Rai, who belongs to Hajipur, said while JD(U) maintained studied silence on the incident. Rai refused to say anything else either about Kushwaha or on the ‘bandh’ call given by  , an obscure organization of upper caste groups, and WhatsApp messages which had gone viral after the April 2 bandh by dalit outfits. 
 
 Reacting sharply, RLSP national general secretary Madhav Anand said RLSP was founded on the basis of socialism and equality. “We have always stood in favour of affirmative action and will continue to do so. The people of   know this very well. The attack was carried out by the miscreants who believe in feudalism and ‘manuvad’. Such cowardice acts will never deter us from our path of social and political equality for every Indian,” he said.
 
 RLSP spokesman   called the Kushwaha’s attackers as “feudal goondas”, pointing out that the incident was an “insult” to dalits, extremely backward classes, backward classes and also to the people of Kushwaha caste.
