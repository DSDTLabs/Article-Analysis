RANCHI: Skipper  's fantastic raiding saw the   maintain their unbeaten run at home as they defeated the   by four points (36-32) in their Zone B encounter at Harivansh Tana Bhagat Indoor Stadium here on Tuesday. By virtue of their eighth win of the season, the Pirates have now moved to the top of the zone, displacing the Bengal Warriors.

 Off to a flier, the Pirates hardly allowed their opposition any breathing space as Narwal ran riot against a vulnerable Bulls defence. Opening the scoring in his very first raid of the evening, the Pirates skipper looked at his scintillating best reeling off one successful raid after the other.
 
 With opposite number Rohit Kumar faltering at the hands of the Pirates defence, Narwal seized the momentum in favour of the hosts, conjuring four successive raid points. While the Bulls struggled to tame Narwal, their situation further deteriorated with Monu Goyat putting up a superb all-round show.
 
 Goyat first got rid of   before Narwal returned for a superlative display of raiding to seize their first allout of the match. The likes of Sunil Jaipal and Ravinder Pahal, with their inexperience, became easy prey for the marauding raider as the Pirates pulled ahead with an eight-point (13-5) lead.
 
 Goyat and Narwal came out hard after the break with determination as the Bulls again wilted under pressure. While Rohit produced a strong display, his teammates clearly lacked the edge. Earlier in the day, an outstanding performance from all-rounder Sandeep Narwal powered the Puneri Paltan to a 12-point (37-25) win over the Haryana Steelers in their Zone A tie.
