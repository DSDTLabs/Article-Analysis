Madurai: A mother, who tried to persuade her daughter to return with her, failed in her attempt after the latter expressed her willingness in court to stay with a transgender, which was the bone of contention of the whole issue 

 “Considering the fact that the detenu (daughter) is major and also the fact that she is desirous to reside with a transgender at Manipur, she is at liberty to act as per her own wish,” a division bench of justices S Vimala and T Krishnavalli said disposing the petition filed by the girl’s mother. 
 
 The mother said that her daughter was studying in a college in Rajapalayam, where she developed friendship with an assistant karate teacher who is allegedly said to be a transgender. Later, she discontinued her studies. The college also sent the transgender out. While so, she was found missing from September 26 last year. Then the petitioner came to know that her daughter is residing with the karate teacher in Manipur. She then lodged a complaint with the Sankarankovil taluk police station and thereafter filed a case seeking direction to police to produce her daughter liberty and set her free. 
 
 Accordingly, inspector Joseph Jetson, sub-inspector V Muthulakshmi and police constable Subbiah went to Manipur and secured the petitioner’s daughter besides producing her before the court. 
 
 When the case came up for hearing, police told the court that the girl attempted to commit suicide, however they saved her and brought her to Tamil Nadu by air by spending from their own pockets. 
 
 Following it, the bench said the police’s action deserved appreciation and directed the SP to reimburse all the expenses spent by them. When the court asked the girl, she said that being a major, she has every liberty to choose her own way of living.
