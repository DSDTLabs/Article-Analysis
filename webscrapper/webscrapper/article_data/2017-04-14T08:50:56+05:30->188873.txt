PATIALA: Trouble at the   Medical, Dental, Nursing and Physiotherapy Colleges, Banur is far from getting over even as the   government is mulling a proposal to shift about 1,500 students to other medical colleges following the ongoing financial crisis that grips the institution. On Thursday, the staff members of the college blocked the national highway-1 (NH-1) near   seeking their rehabilitation in case the institution was shut down.

 They demanded that the government should keep their interests in mind before taking a final call. The medical college staffers had been protesting against the management of the institute as they had not been paid salaries for seven months.
 
 The faculty has already suspended teaching and medical facilities at the institute in the last two months, sending the students in a tizzy who are now facing uncertainty about their future. At present, there are around 1,500 faculty members including doctors, paramedical staff, sweepers, technicians and electricians, who are also in a lurch. All attempts made by the state government following direct intervention by the Punjab health minister Brahm Mohindra have so far failed to yield any results.
