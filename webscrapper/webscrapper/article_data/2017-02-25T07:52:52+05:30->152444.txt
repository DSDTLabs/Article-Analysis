NAGPUR: The two-day art exhibition organized by ‘Art for Concern’, the fund raising arm of Concern India, drew a blank with city art aficionados not purchasing any artwork in its debut exhibition. Organized at   at   on February 22 and 23, the event showed 70 works of well known and upcoming artists, including paintings by the likes of Babu Xavier, Tapas Ghoshal, Pratap Rana, KG Subramanyan and Sudip Roy.

 The exhibition was held to sell art works at nominal prices to raise funds for 300 grass roots organizations working in the sphere of health, child care and community development. “It was a fantastic turnout, which unfortunately for us did not translate into a successful fund raiser,” said  , who heads  , and, incidentally, also hails from the city. “I got a lot of support as many turned up but would have been delighted if the works had flown off the wall,” she told TOI.
 
 The organization holds annual exhibitions in metro cities of works done by known and underprivileged artists. “Art collectors buy from us as they have studied the market and realize that they are able to get authentic art at much lower rates here,” Khanna informed. The organization also holds an art auction once a year at Mumbai and this year it was held on February 9 and was a huge success.
 
 “We chose Nagpur over Ahmedabad for this exhibition. But I have realized that this city needs more exposure to good art so that the buyer can feel more assured of his investment,” Khanna said. She added that though no local sales happened, yet people in Mumbai and Delhi sent their local representatives to this exhibition to buy.
 
 Promising to return next year too, Khanna said her organization had explored a new area and would continue to nurture it. The works exhibited at Nagpur will be available online for the next two weeks.
