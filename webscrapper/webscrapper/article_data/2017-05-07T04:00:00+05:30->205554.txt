 “I like acting,” Madhubhai said. “For me movies are a hobby.” Now, the MLA is slated to play a police officer in his next movie, ‘Lion of Gujarat’. And giving him company in fighting the baddies will be his son, Deepak.
 
 “I have a double role in the movie. The other role is that of an MLA,” Madhubhai said. He said Deepak’s debut in movies was quite accidental. “He has a good physique. We were looking for someone to play a young police officer and that is when deepak’s name came up,” the MLA said.
 
 Deepak said he liked doing the role. “But my priority will always be politics,” he said. 
 
 The son makes an appearance in the movie only towards the climax. Madhu Shrivastav, a police inspector, is going off to fight villains. His senior suggests that he take a young officer with him. And that’s when Deepak shares screen space with his father as the young officer.
