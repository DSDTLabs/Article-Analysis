BENGALURU: Heaving a sigh of relief over what they described as incident-free New Year celebrations in the city, Bengaluru police on Monday said they received no complaints of sexual harassment and molestation during the revelry. 

 "Till now, we haven't received any such complaints. No cases have been filed in any police station across the city," police commissioner T Suneel Kumar said, adding, "Four men were arrested for pickpocketing while at least 20 men, who were inebriated and creating a nuisance for women revellers, were detained." Police were on high alert across the city during the celebrations, in the wake of multiple incidents of alleged molestation during last year's revelry. 
 
  Leaving no stone unturned, police played good Samaritans on Sunday by dropping home revellers, mostly women and children, who were seen stranded by the roadside as cabs and autorickshaws were difficult to get. 
 
 Staff of Pink Hoysalas, the women police patrol vehicles, were assigned the responsibility of transporting women and children to their destinations. 
 
  "The time after the crowds disperse is most important. Motorists speed and chances of miscreants targeting their quarries is high. We made sure that women and children were moved to safe zones and transported later," he said.
