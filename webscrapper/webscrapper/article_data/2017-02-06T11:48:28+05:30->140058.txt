NAGPUR: Three-bike borne miscreants assaulted a 38-year-old trader with a stick and robbed Rs 45,000 cash from him between Agrasen Chowk and   on Saturday night. In two other incidents, miscreants decamped with valuables from women at different places. 

 Grocery shop owner   was headed home on bike from   after closing his shop when he was hit on the head from behind. The trader, who had not worn helmet as he while returning late, lost control over the bike and fell down. The miscreants then pulled out the handbag from his bike’s handle before fleeing with it. The bag contained cash which Khandwani was supposed to deposit in the bank. 
 
 Khandwani, who suffered contusion on the head, said that he generally took the same route to home on   but nothing of this sort had happened earlier. “I had gone blank for sometime after being hit on the head. By the time I could I realize what was happening, the miscreants had sped away with the bag. I feel they must have started following me after spotting the bag hung on the handle,” said Khandwani. 
 
 He also said the miscreants fled towards Sevasadan Chowk and then took left. “I could not see much or notice the registration number of their bike. But, I noticed the one who was behind me was wearing a mask,” he said. 
 
 Khandwani rushed to home before alerting his elder brother Bhupendra who too owns a grocery shop at Itwari. Ganeshpeth police have registered an offence of armed robbery against unidentified persons.
