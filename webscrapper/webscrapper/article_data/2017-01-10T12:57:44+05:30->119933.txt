PATNA: The   (PMC), which earned accolades from Sikh pilgrims for maintaining cleanliness in the city during the recently concluded Prakashotsava, has decided to impose fine on those throwing garbage on roads. The idea, according to   officials, is to sustain the tempo and make Patna a clean city.

 PMC commissioner Abhishek Singh told TOI on Monday that in order to maintain cleanliness in the city with limited resources, the civic body has decided to impose fine on those throwing garbage on roads, including shopkeepers and restaurant owners. However, the amount would be decided at the meeting of the empowered standing committee (ESC) of PMC on Tuesday. 
 
 “We had got additional workers from the urban development and housing department (UDHD) for Prakashotsava. Funds were also allotted to the PMC to carry out various works for the event. A private agency with 783 workers was also roped in to maintain cleanliness. However, the festival is over now and we have to use the limited resources available with us to keep the city clean and green,” he said. Singh also appealed to the citizens of Patna to cooperate with the PMC.
 
 He said the corporation would distribute work among its 3,200 workers them area wise. “Primary roads would be cleaned at least twice a day. We will request the UDHD to provide at least two city managers per circle to look after the work. There are six circles in PMC,” Singh added.
