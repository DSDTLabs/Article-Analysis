HYDERABAD: Cab aggregator   is contemplating rolling out battery-fitted electric three-wheelers in the city in the next one year as part of its pan India project -- ‘Mission: Electric’ to cut down on pollution in all leading metros.

 Sources said the cab aggregator is in talks with the Telangana government to run a considerable number of erickshaws in the city where the market for app cabs is booming.
 
 
 “We have set a target to introduce around 10,000 electric vehicles in various cities of the country. Hyderabad serves as one of the most important markets for us and talks are going on with the government to create an environment for the deployment of electric vehicles,” an Ola official told TOI.
 
 Ola’s e-vehicle project, which was first launched in Nagpur last year, including electric cabs,  ,  , charging stations and battery swapping stations.
 
 “Following the success of the project in Nagpur, we are looking forward to extending the e-vehicle service to other cities like Hyderabad where the number of app cab users is significantly high,” Ola sources said.
 
 The introduction of e-vehicles also aims at benefitting people looking for last mile connectivity at cheaper fares as compared to other modes of transport like autorickshaws or taxis. It is also expected to boost job opportunities as the cab aggregator will have to hire drivers for e-vehicles.
