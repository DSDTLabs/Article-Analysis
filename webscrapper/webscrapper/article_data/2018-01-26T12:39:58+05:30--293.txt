PANAJI: Corporation of the City of   (CCP) has decided to ask the director of municipal administration to declare 16 wards of the state capital as ‘free of open defecation’. Attempts to tackle   in the other wards have been stymied due to lack of public toilets, say councilors.

 At an ordinary council meeting, the council adopted a resolution to declare wards 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 as ‘open-defecation free’ wards.
 
 As per Swachh Bharat guidelines, a preliminary declaration was given on November 9 announcing that the above wards were free of open defecation. CCP invited public objections and feedback and since none were received, decided to propose that the government declare the wards as ‘open defecation free’. tnn
