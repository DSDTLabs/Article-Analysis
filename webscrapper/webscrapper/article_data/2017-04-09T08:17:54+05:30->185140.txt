MUMBAI: BJP legislator  , along with members of the Jain community, on Saturday appealed to slaughterhouses and meat traders in the state to keep their shops shut on Sunday on account of  .

 The appeal comes after the Bombay high court on Thursday set aside a state government circular issued in March 2003, directing all local bodies in the state to shut slaughterhouses and meat shops. The court order stated that the government has no statutory power to direct municipal bodies to shut slaughterhouses on any particular day.
 
 “For 2000 years, and even during the Mughal regime, slaughterhouses remained shut on Mahavir Jayanti,“ said Lodha.“Every person has the right to food and culture, and we respect that, but Mahavir Jayanti is celebrated in the whole world as Ahimsa divas. We request that all slaughterhouses remain shut on Mahavir Jayanti.“
 
 Lodha, and a few legislators, met CM Fadnavis on Friday. He told them the government will appeal against the order. “We were told that as soon as court opens, an appeal will be filed keeping in mind the Jain community's sentiments,“ said Lodha.
