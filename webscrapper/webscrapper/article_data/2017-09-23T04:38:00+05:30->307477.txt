NEW DELHI:   is set to join the rank of saffron leaders being consecrated by the BJP government in policy making. 

  Union rural development ministry will observe the birth centenary of Deshmukh with two days of functions and seminars on its schemes and poverty-alleviation programmes. To be held on October 11 and 12, the ministry will dedicate the functions to the late RSS leader who worked for rural development and also founded a university in Chitrakoot - on the borders of   and Uttar Pradesh. 
 
 The decision to associate Deshmukh with rural development in the government follows widespread naming and renaming of central schemes after Deendayal Upadhyay, RSS leader who also headed the Bharatiya Jana Sangh.
 
  Most central schemes named after   icons,  , Indira Gandhi and  , have been rechristened since the advent of the Modi government. The saffron camp has long felt that association of Gandhi family mascots with schemes targeting the under-privileged is behind Congress's enduring image as a "pro-poor" party. 
 
 Inserting Deshmukh in the official discourse would mark another saffron step in its bid to put an ideological imprimatur on the social sector.
