BENGALURU:   is looking to automate slightly higher value jobs, apart from those at the bottom of the pyramid. The plan is to retrain those who are relieved on account of   and put them on even higher level jobs, which would over time improve employee utilisation.

 "Net employee utilisation dropped to 80.3 per cent in the June quarter, from 81.9 per cent, as more employees were released from traditional projects. We will make them future ready", President & Chief Human Resources Officer Saurabh Govil said. 2,000 people were released in the first quarter due to automation.
 
 “The movement is from L1 (basic jobs) to L2. When we started automation, the aim was to first grab the low hanging fruits. As we do more cognitive implementations, the aim is to make higher value jobs automated as well,” Govil said.
 
 CEO   said the value capture is relatively low at L1 levels. “Hence, we are aligning our internal goals on automating L2 and above tasks,” he said.
 
 Govil said quarterly feedback will be given to employees to help them improve and acquire new skills.
 
 The company’s voluntary quarterly annualised attrition rose to 16.1 per cent, from 14.8 per cent, typical of the quarter as more employees leave a company to pursue higher studies or shift companies after salary hikes. Wipro added 1,309 employees in the quarter, taking its headcount to 166,790 as of June 30.
 
 The company said that 10 per cent, or about 17,000, of its employees have been identified as top performers and they have been given salary hikes that are double that of the company average. The attrition among top performers has been in single digits.
