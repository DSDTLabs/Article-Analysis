CHENNAI: The city police had chalked it down as another  , albeit a particularly gruesome one, after finding a 20-year-old man dead on   early on Friday.

 
 
  
 
 
 An iron rod on the median had pierced the neck and blood had pooled near the body. The motorcycle that the young man was riding had been flung several metres from the median, the scene of a high-speed accident, policemen who arrived at the spot deduced.
 
 That was till the investigating officer received a preliminary autopsy report indicating that S Ganesh, an assistant at a motorcycle repair shop, had been stabbed in the abdomen.
 
 “We have detained a 17-year-old boy for murder after an autopsy report revealed that the victim was stabbed in the stomach,” the officer said. “The juvenile admitted to stabbing the victim while he was riding pillion on the bike near  .”
 
 Citing the autopsy report, he said the accident took place at 4am, two hours before a   police patrol team found the body.
 
 “The juvenile said he planned to kill the mechanic because he had been stalking the girl,” the officer said. “He said he was waiting for Ganesh to make a wrong move. When Ganesh made fun of the girl, he stabbed him and fled the scene.”
 
 The juvenile said Ganesh and he were in love with a girl. The boy said he “had tried to sort out the issue” but Ganesh would not relent.
 
 Ganesh, a one-time welder who worked for a mechanic, had taken a motorcycle from the workshop and went for a ride with the juvenile, who carried a knife with him from his house.
 
 “We initially believed that it was an accident and registered a suspicious death,” the officer said. “We later checked   camera footage and found that a juvenile was riding pillion with Ganesh but was missing from the accident spot.”
 
 The police altered the case to murder and sent the juvenile to the government observation home for boys in Kellys.
