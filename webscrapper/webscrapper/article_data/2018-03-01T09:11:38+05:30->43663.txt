LUDHIANA: The vote percentage of   (BJP) remained better than its alliance partner   (SAD) in the municipal corporation polls. Though BJP could secure only 10 seats against SAD’s 11, the percentage of total votes received by BJP is more than that of SAD. Meanwhile, Congress secured the maximum vote percentage of 43.55 with 2.8 lakh votes in their name. 
 
 With 87,009 votes, SAD secured 13.52% of the total votes cast by the people. BJP’s 87,629 votes amounted to 13.62% of total votes cast by the residents. Again, the   (LIP) might have to satiate with only 7 seats in the MC polls, but the party candidates were successful in getting more   than secured by SAD and BJP individually. The total votes polled in favour of LIP were 89,208 amounting to 13.86% of total polled votes. 
  
 It is pertinent to mention here that LIP had fielded 56 candidates while BJP had 47 seats and SAD 48 seats. 
  
 However, the situation has not been much comfortable for the   (AAP) with only a single seat in their kitty. Vote percentage is also lower than even the independent candidates. Meanwhile, the AAP candidates got only 16,917 votes in their share, which is only 2.63% of the total polled vote. Even the independent candidates got 10.23% of the total vote share with as many as 65,798 votes in their favour. 
  
 The LIP MLA Balwinder Bains said if there would have been fair election, the result of his party would have been much different. It is due to the rigging and fake polling that their candidates lost at a nominal margin. He said they have accepted the mandate and are ready for the next fight. 
  
 BJP district president Ravinder Arora said they contested the elections on 47 seats. Had they contested in all 95 wards, their vote share would have been much better. 
  
 The SAD district president (urban)   said around 15-20% voters did not come out for polling as only 59% polling was recorded. Moreover, there was booth capturing and fake polling due to which their poll share has decreased, he added. He said if there would have been fair polling, results would have been different.
