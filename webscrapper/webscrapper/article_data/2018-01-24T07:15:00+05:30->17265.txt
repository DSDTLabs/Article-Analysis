GURGAON: An FIR was registered against Sana Realtors and its directors on Tuesday, following a court order, for allegedly selling units to investors in Precision Soho Tower, a commercial project in Sector 67, nearly eight years back without having an approved building plan. The developer is also accused of selling common toilets as office space in another commercial project — Silverton Towers — on Golf Course Road Extension.

 Praveen, the investigation officer, said the FIR was registered against the developer under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 467 (forgery), 468 (cheating), 471 (using a forged document as genuine) of the IPC. “We will now investigate the case,” said Praveen adding that they have to file compliance report before February 8, 2018.
 
 Praveen Saluja, one of the complainant, said despite repeated complaint against the developers on different forums no action was taken by department of town and country planning (DTCP). He alleged that even police had initially refused to file the case. 
 
 Yash Handa, another complainant, claimed the developer first took more than 20% of the unit cost and then forwarded the “one-sided” builder-buyer agreement in April 2010. “We were threatened that our money would be forfeited in case we resisted to sign the buyers agreement. The project was to be completed in three years’ time, but it has not been delivered yet,” he said.
 
 Pankaj Gambhir, director of Sana Realtors, did not respond to the calls and messages to get his version.
