  Activists and citizens are opposing the boat club at  . How will you tackle it? 
 
 As of now we have only three motor boats. The boat club has not yet started. We can introduce adventure sports which are not harmful to the environment, like water cycling, pedal board steppers, human-powered monorail, and parasailing. These activities do not require use of fuel.
 
  Your predecessor had suggested that the motor boats of Gangapur boat club could be used at   dam as the water there is not used for drinking and neither are there are birds. Are you going to pursue it? 
 
 It is for the head office to take a call on it. 
 
  What is the status of MTDC's plans for   at   village, Gangapur? 
 
 The central government has discontinued the scheme and asked us to seek funds from the state. We are following up funding with the state. We have completed 70% of the work. The main structure has been constructed. Landscaping and internal roads are remaining. The compound has been constructed at the backside but the front part is remaining.
 
  Are the land issues for Bhavali dam tourism project resolved? 
 
 We are in the process of acquiring land for the project. 
 
  How many bed-breakfast-baths (BBB) does MTDC have now and what is the success post-Kumbh? 
 
 We have 129 BBBs registered with us in the region. More than 80% of them are in Nashik city. They are doing well. We are also thinking of converting some sanatoriums into BBB, like the ones in Panchavati. 
 
  What new concepts would you like to bring? 
 
 When some ministers went to   they noticed spots on the highway with amenities like toilets and shops. We can try this. Nashik has tourism potential.
