Bhopal: Three liquor shops in Bhopal were relocated in wake of Supreme Court’s order to close down liquor vends situated 500 metres from highways across the country. Fearing loss of revenue, the state government decided to shift all such shops.

 These three shops were located on the city outskirts — at 11 Mile on Hoshangabad Road, Sukhi Sewaniya and Ayodhya Bypass.
 
 “ Since morning, the excise department personnel were supervising the relocation of these shops beyond the 500-metre directive of the apex court issued in December last year,” excise department sources said.
 
 When the excise department started the exercise of identifying such shops, it found that the SC ruling had affected more than 1,400 vends out of a total of 3,617 liquor shops in Madhya Pradesh.
 
 Meanwhile, amidst chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s anti-liquor campaign and Supreme Court’s order, the state government posted profit while auctioning liquor shops for the new financial year.
 
 Though the final figures are yet to arrive, the excise department has generated 13% profit in reauctioning of ‘thekas’ as on March 28.
 
 Excise commissioner Arun Kochar said, “ A total of 288 shops remained to be auctioned across the state till March 28. After reauctioning, the revenue was up by almost 13%.”
 
 Close on the heels of the November 8, 2016 demonetisation order, the Supreme Court had on December 15 ordered to close liquor shops within 500 metres of highways. The ruling has hit almost 40% shops in the state. However, the state government did not close the vends but decided to relocate them.
 
 “Had the government downed their shutters, the Rs7,500-crore business from the sale of booze in the state would have suffered almost 40% revenue loss,” a senior bureaucrat said.
