Chennai: Companies backed by external investors, more particularly PE/VC investors have grown faster than those that are self funded or those corporates that tapped into public equity markets, says a report by Venture Intelligence. For the period 2011 to 2016, PE backed companies witnessed 40% growth in revenues while non PE backed listed entities saw a 15% growth, the report said.

 “The presence of a PE / VC investor provides a kind of certification which, while broadening the equity base, also helps the investee companies access other sources of funding including debt capital. PE/VC investors also forge active partnerships with their investee companies to improve growth and business strategy, besides opening up new opportunities,” said  , professor,  , under whose guidance the report was prepared.
 
 Between 2011 and 2016, PE-VC firms invested over $72 billion in Indian companies – over 6.5 times what was raised via Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Given that PE funded companies were one-sixth the size of all listed companies, the report suggested that these funds have played an important role in providing long term capital to small companies. 
 
 While PE/VCs outstripped equity markets from a revenue perspetive, companies backed by PE/VCs fared poorly in terms of profitability. The average annual growth rate of profits for PE-VC funded companies during the period of the study was the lowest at -73%. 
 
 “The common thread that emerges from The Study is that PE-VC investment, when chosen and leveraged well, can help companies scale up rapidly and accelerate growth in several ways that add significant value to the Indian economy,” said  , CEO of Venture Intelligence.
