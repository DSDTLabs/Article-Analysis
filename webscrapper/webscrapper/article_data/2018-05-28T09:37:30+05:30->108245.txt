LONDON: Scientists have developed an artificial intelligence ( ) system that can identify people by measuring their gait or walking pattern. The technology could be used at airport security instead of fingerprinting and eye-scanning. It can successfully verify an individual simply by analysing the footstep 3D and time-based data.

 
 The AI system, developed by researchers at   in the UK and   in  , correctly identified an individual almost 100% of the time, with just a 0.7 error rate. Physical biometrics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition and retinal scans, are currently more commonly used for security purposes.
 
 “Each human has approximately 24 different factors and movements when walking, resulting in every individual person having a unique, singular walking pattern. Therefore monitoring these movements can be used, like a fingerprint or retinal scan, to recognise and clearly identify or verify an individual,” said  , from University of Manchester.
 
 One the key benefits of using footprint recognition is, unlike being filmed or scanned at an airport, the process is non-intrusive for the individual and resilient to noise environmental conditions.
