AHMEDABAD: In times when din over beef ban is the loudest, the Comptroller and Accountant General (CAG) has blamed the state government for not bothering to control quality of meat being sold in the state for last five years.

 CAG report has also exposed how all abattoirs functioning in the state of   are running without proper license from concerned authorities. Interestingly, all the slaughter houses are run by government instrumentalities.
 
 Such facts were highlighted on Friday, when Gujarat chief minister   said while addressing the   that he wanted ‘vegetarian’ Gujarat. This was immediately after the state assembly cleared amendments in the anti-cow slaughtering   making punishment more severe.
 
 In its report, CAG has highlighted that though the state has sizeable population – 39.05% - of non-vegetarian, the Food & Drug Control Administration (FDCA) had not taken any measures to bring the slaughter houses and meat shops under the Food Safety Standard (FSS) Act.
 
 The audit report revealed that there are only nine slaughter houses situated under the municipal corporation/municipality area, but all of them are functioning without license under FSS Act.
 
 The audit report rebuked the authorities because out of thousands of meat shops in the state, only 55 shops have been registered, whereas FSS Act mandates compulsory registration/license to carry on any food business.
