 recently took to Twitter to announce that   is a part of his upcoming film, ‘Thugs of Hindostan’. He tweeted:

 
 The film not only stars Aamir Khan but also   playing one of the lead actors. Along with Katrina Kaif, ‘Dangal’ actress   will be seen opposite Aamir Khan in the film.
 
 Just after Katrina Kaif’s confirmation in ‘Thugs of Hindostan’,   took to his Twitter handle to congratulate her, but in his own hilarious style! Salman Khan tweeted:
 
 
 After ‘Dhoom 3’, this is Katrina Kaif’s second film with Aamir Khan and for the first time she will be seen sharing screen space with Amitabh Bachchan. The actress is currently busy juggling between ‘Jagga Jasoos’ and ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’. Soon after the completion of these films, it’s been reported that Katrina Kaif will undergo a special training for ‘Thugs of Hindostan’. While we are excited to see Katrina Kaif playing a ‘thug’, what’s more exciting is to see her chemistry with Aamir Khan on big screen once again!
