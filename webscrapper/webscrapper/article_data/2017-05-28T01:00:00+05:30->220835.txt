Director   is attempting something different in his second film,  . The film will have no elements of romance and violence, an attempt that is rare in Tamil cinema. “The film revolves around the life of four friends. In life, we are asked to forego certain things to lead our lives better. This film focuses on those things and how they help us for the betterment of our lives. The title, in fact, is about our forgotten traditional game — gilli, bambaram and goli. What connection the game has with the story line and how these friends solve issues without resorting to bloodshed or violence forms the crux,” says Manoharan. The film stars Thamizh, Prasad, Naresh and Deepthi Shetty. Santhosh Kumar plays the antagonist in the film. Actors Ganja Karuppu and   play pivotal roles in the film. “The biggest challenge was to work with newcomers. Today, most filmmakers opt for established stars owing to the risk involved in the film’s success. I had faith in my script and the actors. We chose the best five among 40 people, who had auditioned for the film. They were given four months training prior to the shooting,” he adds. Most of the film was shot in and around   and Langkawi.
