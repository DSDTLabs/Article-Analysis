With almost half-a-dozen films in her kitty even before her first movie has hit screens,   is on a signing spree. The actress has the trilingual flick  ,  ,   and Podhu Nalan Karudhi, among others, in her kitty. 

 An excited Leesha says, “Madai Thiranthu, which is 1945 in Telugu, has   playing the lead role. The period film throws light on intriguing aspects of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose’s life. I play a traditional girl from south India — as the movie is set in olden times, we had to undergo training on a lot of things. Priyamudan Priya, directed by AJ Sujith, has me paired opposite Ashok Kumar, while Santhosh Pratap is my co-star in Podhu Nalan Karudhi. Another project of mine, Eedili, a thriller, is a woman-centric movie. I’m happy to play the lead role in it ; the film has me in a bold avatar.”
