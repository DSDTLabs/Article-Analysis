New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Friday agreed to grant an   hearing on the appeal filed by   seeking a common symbol for municipal corporation polls.

 However, due to a strike by lawyers on Friday, the matter could not be taken up for   and the division bench will now hear it on Saturday. The party has challenged a single judge’s order dismissing its plea to allot a common symbol to its candidates for the civic polls. 
 
 In absence of counsel for the Delhi state election commission (SEC), HC refused to pass an interim order, even as senior advocate  , who appeared for Swaraj India, sought the court’s intervention saying it is an urgent matter and the last date for filing nomination papers for polls is April 3.
 
 But a bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and   maintained it cannot pass any ex-parte interim order and also questioned why the outfit approached the court “so late” — an issue also raised by the single judge.
