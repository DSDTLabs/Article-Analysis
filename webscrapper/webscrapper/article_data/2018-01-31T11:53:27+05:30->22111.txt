MADURAI: Researchers found an undocumented species of reptile, a rock dwelling gecko, in   Wildlife Sanctuary recently. The Megamalai Rock Gecko, which is its suggested common name by researchers, is the first description of a reptile from this landscape since 1949 after English planter and naturalist Angus Finlay Hutton spotted Hutton’s Pit Viper in Megamalai. 

 The large seized gecko, growing up to a length of 20 centimeters from head to tail-tip, is presently known only from the confines of Megamalai Wildlife Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu according to team of researchers consisting R Chaitanya, a herpetologist studying Megamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Aparna Lajmi from Centre for Ecological Sciences,  , Bengaluru and Dr   from National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru.
 
 “This is a second time, a reptile species is found from Megamalai and this particular gecko is found only in Megamalai region”, quipped Chaitanya. Megamalai Rock Gecko would have been misidentified in the past as Spotted Rock Gecko (Hemidactylus maculatus) endemic to northern Western Ghats of Maharashtra. But detailed morphological observations coupled with DNA sequencing showed that these two geographically isolated populations are in fact distinct from each other, he said.
 
 An article on this new species has been published by the researchers in Zootaxa, an international peer-reviewed journal devoted to taxonomical research, on January 17. The researchers also expressed their gratitude to TN Forest Department for their support for granting permits to work in the region. “ The team which found the species is from Indian Institute of Science and it is authentic”, mentioned Megamalai Wildlife Warden, Rammohan K.
