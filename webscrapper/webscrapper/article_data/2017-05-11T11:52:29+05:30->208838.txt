HYDERABAD: Over 5.39 lakh members from the Yadava and   communities have queued up to lay their hands on the 5,000 crore worth 84 lakh   which would be distributed to them by the TRS-government with 42 lakh of the animals being distributed in the current   and an equal number in the next financial year. 

 The selection of beneficiaries for the first phase distribution in the current fiscal commenced on Wednesday and will continue up to May 20. Though Wednesday was the last day for member-enrolment, officials sought more time stating there was scope for enrolment of another 30,000 members from two beneficiary communities.
 
 While giving permission to the officials to enrol members for another five days, the government directed them to ensure that such enrolment is taken up only in villages where selection of beneficiary is not being done. Those who have been left out can be covered as beneficiaries in the next phase of distribution, it was decided.
 
 "The crucial phase of selection of beneficiaries for distribution of over 42 lakh sheep in the first phase i.e. in the current fiscal, commenced on Wednesday. Draw of lots was conducted in several gram sabhas and beneficiaries for first phase were selected. This selection through draw of lots would continue until May 20 and during these days, enrolment could be taken up wherever draw of lots is not being conducted," a senior official said.
 
 Sources said that as many as 7,037 Sheep Breeding Societies were formed till May 10 with a membership of 5,39,433 at the rate of 76.6 members on an average per Society. However, not all of them were attending the selection process due to their earlier commitment of going out of station, marriages and even emergencies. This has left officials in many gram panchayats high and dry.
