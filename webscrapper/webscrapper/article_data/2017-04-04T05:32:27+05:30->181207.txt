Bhopal: Pay-day joy soon turned distressing for many on Monday. Most of the ATMs across the city ran dry leaving many gasping for cash. 

 After the March-end closure and week-end holiday, the banks reopened Monday morning making it the pay-day for many. However, most of the ATMs continued to display the ‘no cash’ boards leaving people dejected. These included the ATMs of public sector banks like   (SBI) and that of private sector banks like HDFC as well. 
 
 For Ramsaran Bisariya in Bairagarh, the day began with turning away empty handed from an SBI ATM in his locality. In need of cash, he had to spent a good part of his day searching for an ATM with cash from Bairagarh to New Market. 
 
 He said he has tried ATMs of Punjab National Bank, Andhra Bank and HDFC at New Market. “None of them have any cash,” he said. 
 
 Bisariya’s search ended at an ATM located at the GTB complex post noon.
 
 Rajesh Kumar, an HDFC bank debit card holder, had similar woes to share. “For the past two days, there is no cash in any of the ATMs I visited,” he said.
 
 A number of ATMs in the city are cash dry since April 1 as they are not replenished. Requesting anonymity, a senior SBI official said, “ Banks were closed for two days for year-end clearances which was followed by a Sunday. As such, most of the ATMs could not be filled with cash.”
 
 SBI has 436 ATMs in   city -- the maximum number for any bank. The bank official said the ATMs are being replenished. However, by 4pm on Monday, 40 ATMs of the bank were still left to be refilled, said another officials of the bank.
