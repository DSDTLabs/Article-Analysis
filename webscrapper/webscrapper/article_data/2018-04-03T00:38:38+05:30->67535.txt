Salem: Groundwater level in Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts has depleted due to poor rainfall. Farmers in these districts will be left in the lurch if southwest and northeast monsoon seasons fail this year.

 “Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri district farmers depend on groundwater as the Thenpennai River is dry even during rainy seasons,” said an official from the meteorological department. Talking to TOI, he said farmers will struggle for water for irrigation needs, especially in coming months of May, June and July.
 
 Hit by acute water shortage, most of the farmers in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts started pumping water from borewells to their open wells. “We will top-up water level in open wells using water from borewells. Later, we will use the same water to our farms,” said K Periyasamy, a farmer from Periyampatti village in Dharmapuri district. 
 
 Though Cauvery flows through Dharmapuri district, the farmers could not depend on the river water during drought season. “Now, we don’t have sufficient water to save our crops,” a farmer said.
 
 According to the data available with the public works department (PWD), the average groundwater level in Salem district currently available is at 10.20 metre. It was marked at 14.25 metre depth in the same month in 2017. 
 
 “Nearly 4.05 metre groundwater level reduced in the district when compared last year,” said an official from PWD, on condition of anonymity. He said the water level in Namakkal marked at 14.86 metre in 2017 and it was standing at 11.91 metre this year. 
 
 Similarly, the groundwater level was at 11.04 metre in 2017 and now it has marked 9.85 metre in Dharmapuri district and Krishnagiri the average groundwater level was marked at 9.19 metre in 2017 and now marked at 7.53 metre this year.
