New Delhi: In a rare moment in the history of  , two of its senior most   bid farewell within 24 hours on Wednesday and Thursday.

 Justices B D Ahmed and Pradeep Nandrajog will now head Jammu & Kashmir and Rajasthan high courts respectively.
 
 On Thursday, Delhi   saw a full court reference to honour Justice Nandrajog, who in the recent past delivered some landmark verdicts including the DU photocopy case against international publishers.
 
 The judge who joined the bar in 1981 is also known for authoring the judgment that threw open the doors of elite Sanskriti school to all, quashing the 60% quota for officers’ kids. With Justice Mukta Gupta, he led a charged up division bench on criminal side that saw significant cut in pendency and swift disposal of criminal appeals.
 
 Justice Nandrajog’s rulings on paramilitary and   have also helped numerous jawans and constables get entry into the forces. He held that public employment can’t be denied merely because a candidate was booked for a criminal offence where the nature of the crime was trivial, such as dispute with neighbours. The judge held that government employers must make a difference between a “felony” and a “misdemeanour.”
 
 The bench had noted that, “Life is too precious to be staked over petty incidents and the cruel result of conviction for petty offences being the end of the career, the future and the present, of young and inexperienced persons cannot blast their life and their dreams.”
 
 Due to elevation of Justice B D Ahmed as Chief Justice of J&K high court, a fresh bench will look into cases important for the city. Justice Ahmed with Justice Ashutosh Kumar passed some seminal directions on improving air quality of the city, on removing illegal construction and making the city safer for women. It was his bench that was monitoring steps being taken to reduce air pollution and to improve policing after the Nirbhaya incident.
