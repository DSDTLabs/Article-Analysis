CHARMINAR: The   ( ) work has led to a steep 50% drop in businesses around the Charminar, over the last few months. While fruit vendors in the area had already been reeling under losses, the ongoing work has now come to haunt bangle sellers and other stores owners in the Old City. 

 Speaking about their plight, a bangle store owner, Mohammed Sohail, said how customers from the districts who usually visited the   are now winding up their shopping at   owing to the many restrictions imposed by the traffic cops around the bazaar.
 
 "Business has taken a huge hit due to the CPP work. Customers willing to visit and shop at Laad Bazaar complain about multiple obstacles and the limited accessibility," said Sohail. 
 
 Another shopkeeper from the area added how over and above the "traffic restrictions" people are also faced with the mammoth problem of parking and the frequent traffic snarls that are caused because of haphazard parking at busy junctions. 
 
 While, usually, Ramzan shopping picks up pace from the night of Shab-e-Meraj - which falls on April 13 - traders fear that CPP work might act as a dampener this time around. Predictably, traders wanted the   (GHMC) to expedite the ongoing work and complete it before the festival season.
 
 "My customer footfall has dropped by almost 30-40% as people are not able to visit my shop because of the work. A lot of youth have lost their earnings owing to CPP work around Charminar. While I was certain of my lassi business doing well this season, the sales have drastically come down instead," said, Mohammed Matwale.
