THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In its latest move for the protection of women and children, vigilant groups constituted by   mission will be extended to all wards in the state. Of the nearly 20,000 wards in  , the vigilant groups have been constituted in 15,000 wards. This comes in at a time when efforts are on to strengthen   or vigilant committees at the panchayat-level constituted by local self-government (LSG) bodies.

 "Unlike Jagratha Samithis at the panchayat-level with an advisory role, these groups at the ward-level will be an activity group which will ensure immediate intervention to prevent violence against women and children. It will be led by Kudumbashree neighbourhood groups (Ayalkootams) women and gender resource persons," Kudumbashree executive director   said, "The aim will be to ensure child and women-friendly wards".
 
 "Each vigilant group at the ward-level will have five to 10 members. It will form part of the national mission for empowerment of women with the support of social justice department (SJD) and   police. Snehita help desks, integrated child development services (ICDS) supervisors and Anganwadi members of the SJD will offer assistance to these groups," said Kudumbashree program manager Soya Thomas.
 
 Gender sensitisation and capacity building training will be offered to the group members at the 130 gender resource centres at panchayats. Kudumbashree has set aside about Rs 1 crore for the same. Initially, 25 members will be trained and they will then provide training to other groups, the officials said.
