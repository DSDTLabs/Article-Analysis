HYDERABAD:   Ali Khan proved to be a hard nut to crack. He consistently maintained both with his relatives and police his innocence in the disappearance of his seven-year-old nephew. He, however, came around after one-hour of   by the police and confessed that he had lured away Mir Abbas Hassan Razvi, with a promise of buying him fruit juice, and killed the boy at a graveyard.

 Initially, he claimed he had taken the boy on his bike from   and later dropped him at the same place. Nailing his lie, a   showed that Jawad was alone when he returned on his bike.
 
 This convinced both the South Zone sleuths and Task Force police, who jointly interrogated the accused, that Jawad was the one who brutally murdered Razvi.
 
 “Till a few years ago, the families of both the victim and the accused lived together at Moula Ali. It was during this period, Jawad's son died. Later, Jawad went to Saudi Arabia on employment. He returned recently,'' assistant commissioner of police Ashok Chakrawarthy said.
 
 Officials said that a dispute between the two famili es pertaining to the management of a graveyard at Moula Ali was also being probed by police. Though they lived at Moula Ali, they own houses at various parts of the   . While Jawad resides at Rein Bazar, Razvi's parents stay at Yakutpura.
 
 Jawad even contacted Sijju, a rowdysheeter, and sought his advice in covering up the murder and eliminating every possible evidence. “All angles are being probed to find out the motive behind the murder. A chargesheet will be filed as early as possible in the case,'' deputy commissioner of police (South Zone) V Satyanarayana said.
