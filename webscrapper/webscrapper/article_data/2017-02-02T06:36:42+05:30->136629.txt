NEW DELHI: The   ( ) on Wednesday directed the chief secretary of Delhi to constitute a committee that will assess if there are CNG or petrol variants of mechanised   that can be procured for the capital.

 The committee, which will include commissioners of all three municipal corporations, will decide on the procurement of sweeping machines based on the findings.
 
 The tribunal was hearing an application filed by the south corporation seeking permission to buy 30   sweeping machines of more than 2,000cc size. The NGT, on December 11, 2015, had passed an order that prohibited the registration of diesel vehicles.
 
 “The machines proposed to be deployed have an engine capacity of more than 2,000CC and run on diesel. As per the information gathered from various sources it has been found that these are all diesel powered machines and the petrol or CNG variants of these machines are not available in the domestic market. The deployment of mechanical road sweeping machine is expected to keep the dust or air pollution under control which is otherwise caused due to manual sweeping,” the   said in its application.
 
 “The committee will conduct or get a market survey conducted whether road sweeping machines are available in CNG or petrol. If such CNG or petrol-run machines are not available, the Delhi government will order purchase of these machines for road sweeping and other related purposes,” the bench said.
 
 “And if these machines are available in CNG or petrol then efforts will be made to purchase these (preferably CNG-run) instead of the diesel machines,” the bench said.
