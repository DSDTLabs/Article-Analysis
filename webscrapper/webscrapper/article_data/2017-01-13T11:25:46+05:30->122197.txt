NEW DELHI: Friday could be a day of reckoning for 
  factions as the   (EC) will hear their claims to the party symbol ‘cycle’ even as 
  and his son, CM  , show no indication of burying the hatchet.

 Mulayam and brother Shivpal Yadav, along with confidant Amar Singh, have been camping in Delhi discussing the situation and sending documents to the EC while Akhilesh held meetings with supporters in Lucknow.
 
 After announcing the poll schedule for UP, the EC is running out of time and will have to pronounce a verdict soon. If it cannot settle the claims at short notice, there is a possibility of the symbol being frozen and the two factions being given alternate ones.
 
 EC sources said the special convention called on behalf of Akhilesh by SP national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav was being carefully examined for its legality as per party rules. During the convention in Lucknow, the Akhilesh camp passed three resolutions, including the CM replacing Mulayam as party president and the “elevation” of the Yadav patriarch as “margdarshak” or guide. The opposing camp says Mulayam could have been replaced only after serving a notice, which did not happen.
 
 Moreover, Mulayam has claimed that Ram Gopal had no authority to convene the meet since he had been expelled from the party. Both factions are bracing to meet the consequences of the party symbol being frozen.
 
 Sources said the Akhilesh camp is hopeful of being given ‘motorcycle’ as a symbol after floating Akhil Bharatiya   while adopting the Samajwadi Janata Party of late Chandra Shekhar is another option. Sources said Mulayam has reached out to the Lok Dal founded by the late Charan Singh in 1980. Mulayam was part of this party in his initial career and had contested the 1985 assembly polls on the Lok Dal’s symbol of a farmer ploughing a field.
