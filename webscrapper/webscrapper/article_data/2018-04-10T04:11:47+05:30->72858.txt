Actor-writer-producer  , who has been a target of several   for her frank opinion, on Monday said that these   trolls are like cockroaches.

  
  
 At an event, Twinkle expressed that online trolls are like cockroaches. 
 
 "They come along and they do that to everybody and people who take trolls seriously, I'd rather say they are foolish. Trolls are like cockroaches, once in a while, you spray hit on them and get them out of the way and you go on," she said.
 
 Eminent personalities were present at the event.
 
 Twinkle further said that she takes criticism carefully. 
 
 "I do look at criticism and examine it carefully as sometimes it is valid and it always tells me about the world around me," she added.
 
  has also been targeted several times on social media. Her political allegiance and strong viewpoint have attracted many threats.
 
 Talking about online trolls and dealing with them, Gul said, "The moment you take a position, you set yourself up for an attack; either from people, who disagree with you or people who just don't like the fact that you have taken a position because traditionally women, especially those who belong to film industry, are not entitled to have an opinion."
 
 "A woman having an opinion was discouraged outside and within the industry, but it is changing now," she said.
