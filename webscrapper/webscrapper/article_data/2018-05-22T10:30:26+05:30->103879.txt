In the latest episode of   Ka Ooltah Chashmah, Bhide is worried for his Sakharam and he takes Champak chacha's permission to ask a few questions to Tapu. 

 
 Tapu says he will speak the truth and this worries  . Tapu smartly tells Bhide if his scooter Sakharam is not in the society compound then it must be in a garage. Bhide gets worried and realises that his Sakharam is stolen. 
 
 Jethalal is happy that how smartly Tapu handled the situation without even lying to his dada ji. 
 
 Then Champak chacha suggests Bhide to go and register a complaint for his lost scooter. Bhide, Iyer and Popatlal agree with him and decide to go to the police station. Jethalal feels tensed thinking if police is involved then it will be difficult to get Sakharam back.
 
 Jethalal then hints to Dr Hathi that he should stop Bhide from going to the police station. Dr Hathi tells Bhide that he should stay here and let Jethalal go to the police station to register complaint. 
 
 Sodhi and Jethalal finally manage to make Bhide, Iyer stop from leaving the society but Popatlal says he will accompany them since he is a journalist and will be able to help them. 
 
 Jethalal and Sodhi are unable to stop him and Popatlal tags along. Jethalal and Sodhi make excuses but are unable to make Popatlal leave. Then Jethalal decides to tell Popatlal the truth about Sakharam.
