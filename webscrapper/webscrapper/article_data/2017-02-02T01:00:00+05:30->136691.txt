 In its 12th year, the college saw participation of more than 200 climbers. “This is the annual championship that we organize each year, where not only students from our college but also other colleges and schools participate. They do not represent any school or come as a team from any school or college, they compete individually. One advantage that we as students of Stephen’s have is that we have practised enough on this wall. But more than anything, one needs dedication and the spirit to not give up,” says Rishva Mathur, secretary of the hiking club of the college.
