MUMBAI: Having struggled to get back to her best post her knee surgery last year, badminton superstar   has made it clear that she will take some more time to get back to her best. "There is nothing much that can be planned as of now. The surgery phase was a little difficult. It is not easy to come back after such a surgery because there are slot of movements you suddenly forget. The cross movement is a struggle to deal with, and it takes time to get your movement back," Saina said at the Edelweiss Brain Bout event on Sunday evening.

 On her coach  's observation that she was tentative at the net because of her injury, Saina said, "There will definitely be issues when you come out of injury, it remains in your mind. I don't feel it as it is natural phenomenon. But we are working on the net area."
 
 She added, "I'm losing narrowly, say (from) 18 points in 3rd game. Confidence also matters, and once I get a win here and there, it will come back. Fitness is important because of the scheduling of back to back tournaments. I can see that I am not very far from my best. It will come with a 5-6 week break."
 
 Saina is looking forward to play at Thailand (Grand Prix), Indonesia and Australia (super series) events. "I'm not thinking about ranking, it's about winning tournaments. Ranking will obviously improve by winning tournaments," she said.
 
 On compatriot PV Sindhus phenomenal progress, Saina said, "Sindhu is also playing a lot of opponents a lot of matches, lot of top players, so she's competing with the best. It shows her fighting spirit which has gone higher. That's the reason she's able to achieve so much."
 
 Saina expressed happiness at the new   (BAI) president   recently clearing the prize money which had been due to the players for the last 3 years. "Akhilesh Das Gupta (who passed away recently) took badminton to a certain level in India and I'm sure the new president will take it further," she felt.
