KOLHAPUR: The   is also likely to announce to go solo for the 2019 elections at a party convention to be held on Saturday.

 The likely decision is coming in the wake of BJP’s resolve to fight all assembly constituencies in the district for the 2019 polls. Revenue minister and   leader   appealed to party workers that they should be ready to contest all ten constituencies and begin preparations for the polls.
 
 If the BJP advances its preparations, then it will be a bigger setback to the Shiv Sena — its ally in the state government. The Sena won at six of ten assembly constituencies in the district and suffered a major dent in the Congress-NCP bastion. The BJP is eyeing all the seats. 
 
 A senior Shiv Sena functionary said, “Patil taunted us, saying we are a party that only makes noise. On Saturday, our convention will decide the future course of action. The BJP is relying on outsiders for the win in the assembly constituencies, but we have genuine and well-rooted leaders across the district.”
 
 Sena-BJP relations soured after the recent local body elections. At most places, the Sena informally aligned with   and NCP to defeat BJP candidates. But, this had the least impact. The BJP increased its party stronghold after the municipal council polls.
