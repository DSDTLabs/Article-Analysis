PATNA:   was celebrated with pomp and show across Bihar on Wednesday.

 The state capital wore a festive look with almost all the roads leading to major temples illuminated with colourful lights and saffron flags with Jai Shri Ram written on them. Religious songs devoted to Lord Ram and Sita blared from loudspeakers installed on the temples and roadsides.
 
 The Mahavir Mandir near   drew a sea of devotees since Tuesday evening. Satish Singh, 55, and his 50-year-old wife Manju Singh of Digha spent four hours in a queue before they could enter the temple and offer puja to the Lord.
 
 “We are feeling now blessed,” said Manju who had been fasting since Monday.
 
 Vibha Singh had come all the way from Ramachak Bairriya to Mahavir Mandir. “My devotion for Lord Ram gives me strength to bear the difficulties of life,” the housewife told TOI on Wednesday morning while she bought laddoo and garlands before entering the temple. 
 
 The administration had banned vehicular traffic on the stretch from the temple towards the GPO roundabout. The devotees forming a queue from the temple up to the   Park on the stretch continuously chanted the name of Lord Ram.
 
 Hindu as well as Muslim volunteers were seen managing the crowd and helping the devotees.   Dookandar Sangh functionary   was one of them. “All we shopkeepers of the market contribute money... We also provide help to the fasting devotees if they ask for it,” he said as he gave a glass of sherbet to one in the queue.
 
 Devotees also thronged the famous ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) temple on Buddh Marg and participated in ‘mahabhishek’, ‘arti’ and ‘kirtan’. A talk on the incarnation of Lord Ram was also organised at the temple.
