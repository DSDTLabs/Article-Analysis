MEERUT: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday paid tribute to slain constable  , who was fatally wounded in Kairana in a recent encounter in which dreaded criminal  , a member of the   gang, was gunned down. “I salute Ankit for his supreme sacrifice. Today, Kairana, which had earlier become a symbol of fear and oppression, is no longer seen in that light. People are living without any fear,” the CM said.
 
  While addressing a rally in Meerut, Yogi also announced that the ex-gratia compensation to Tomar’s family will be doubled. “Our government is working towards doubling compensation for cops who die in process of ensuring safe environment for citizens,” he said.
  
  Ever since the Yogi government came to power, western UP has witnessed a spurt in police encounters, so much so that even NHRC has issued a notice to the state government in this regard. Out of 27 criminals who were gunned down by cops in 2017, 18 were from western UP.
  
  Kairana has always found a special mention in BJP leaders’ speeches ever since the issue of “exodus” out of the ear of criminals was raised by local MP   in June 2016. A large number of criminals have been arrested or gunned down from this region. In almost all his speeches, Yogi has admired police for their “good work”.
