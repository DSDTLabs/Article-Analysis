Coimbatore: The opposition DMK on Tuesday alleged that AIADMK members were interfering in the conduct of cooperative elections in the district.

 In a complaint to the district administration, DMK MLA N Karthik alleged that cooperative department officials, special officers as well as police were working hand in glove with AIADMK members to rig the election in favour of the ruling party. He also said DMK men were denied nomination papers, to stop them from contesting the elections.
 
 “When we approached the special officers, they neither issued us nomination papers nor accepted the papers. AIADMK men are, meanwhile, threatening those who want to file nominations. The ruling party members want to capture all the cooperative societies by force and exploit the vast resources of the societies,’’ Karthik alleged.
 
 Pointing out that during its tenure elections to the cooperative societies were held in a free and fair manner, he said, “But when the elections were conducted five years ago during the AIADMK regime, there was political interference. Similarly, now AIADMK men are preventing others from filing nominations,’’ Karthik said.
 
 DMK has warned of a series of protests, if the district administration authorities failed to intervene and ensure a fair election. “We will stage protests in places where elections are not held in a free and fair manner,” he said.
 
 There are about 1,800 cooperative societies in as many as 15 government departments, including agriculture, housing and fisheries. The elections to the 18,775 posts of office-bearers in these societies would be conducted in TN in five phases.
