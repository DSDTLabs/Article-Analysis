AHMEDABAD: The coming   has led   to issue instructions to lower courts for conservation of water and electricity.

 Upon instructions from the Chief Justice R S Reddy, the HC registry has forwarded a note to all courts situated in the city asking them to follow specific instructions to save water and power.
 
 The court administrations have been instructed for regular checking of faucets and taps, to use signage for reminding people to turn off the water while lathering and scrubbing hands. The HC has insisted on educating people in courts over conservation and asked lower court administrations to make sure that all involved should know that the institution is focused on water conservation.
 
 The HC has advised for smart watering during landscaping that it should be done in the morning so that water goes into the soil instead of evaporating. All courts are asked to install rain sensors so that the system turns off at the time of rain. The HC has asked to reuse water disposed of from RO water purifiers and to install low flush toilets.
 
 To conserve power, the HC has advised use of LED lights instead of CFL. Maximizing usage of solar panels has been suggested apart from maximum usage of natural lighting.
