CHENNAI: Citing Bar Council of India (BCI) rules that bar lawyers from turning litigants, the   on Thursday dismissed habeas corpus petitions (HCP) filed by two lawyers to trace the `missing MLAs' of Tamil Nadu.

 A division bench comprising Justice M Jaichandren and Justice T Mathivanan, which had reserved the orders on the HCPs filed by lawyers Elavarasan and Preetha on February 13, held that the petitions were not maintainable since they had been filed by advocates.
 
 “Having taken into consideration the relevant facts, we find that since the question of maintainability is hanging over the petition, we do not find any merits,“ the bench said. Referring to the BCI rules, the judges said, “Rule 9 contemplated that an advocate should not act or plead in any manner in which he himself is peculiarly interested and Rule 18 mandated that an advocate shall not act at any time as a party to fomented litigants. Keeping in view the fact, we are of the considered view that the petitions are devoid of any merit and therefore deserve to be dismissed.“
 
 The HCPs claimed that AIADMK MLAs -Geetha of Krishnarayapuram constituency and R T Ramachandran of Kunnam constituency -had been kept in illegal confinement against their wishes for the past one week.
 
 During arguments, their counsel K Balu and Preetha told the bench that more than 100 MLAs belonging to the AIADMK had been kept at a resort in Koovathur on East Coast Road and that their safety and liberty were in danger.Congress advocate A P Suryaprkasam and social activist `Traffic' Ramaswamy too raised similar concerns.
 
 State public prosecutor R Rajarathinam, however, denied allegations of unlawful custody and said they were staying at the resort on their own volition, and submitted statements from 119 MLAs to that effect.
 
 The statements were recorded by a team of revenue and police officials, deputed by Kancheepuram district superintendent of police, as directed by the court, he said. The case evoked a lot of public attention, since it came at a time when chief minister O Panneerselvam was involved in a tug of war with AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala for the chief minister's post.
