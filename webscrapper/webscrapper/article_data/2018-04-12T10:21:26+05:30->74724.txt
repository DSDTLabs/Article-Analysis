The most important thing is to start projects that generate power at a cheap rate and hydel projects top the list,” said power minister MM Mani.

 The government also plans to generate electricity from alternative methods like solar and wind energy. “After LDF govt took charge, it began solar projects that added 150 MW. We will be generating 500MW solar plants. Government institutions,   schools, hospitals etc will have to generate solar energy. The government has started taking steps in this direction,” he said.
