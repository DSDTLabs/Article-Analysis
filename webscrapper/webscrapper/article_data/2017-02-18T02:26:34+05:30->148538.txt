GURUGRAM: After keeping it under observation for 12 hours, the forest department on Friday   in the Shivalik hills the three-and-a-half-year-old   that had strayed into a house in   on Thursday. Officials said the big cat was released after it was declared fit, following a medical examination.

 The leopard was   by a team of forest and wildlife officials on Thursday afternoon from Krishna Colony, a residential area near Old Railway Road in Palwal. Forest officials Thursday said the leopard had reached the city by possibly hiding in a truck carrying goods from Saharanpur, which is close to the Shivalik hills, to warehouses in Palwal.
 
 “However, it still remains a mystery how has the leopard come all the way from the Shivalik hills to the city. Anyway, our veterinary surgeons have confirmed that the leopard has lighter coat than the leopards found in the Aravalli hills. What is important is that the leopard was absolutely fit and healthy and so we released it in the Shivalik hills,” MD Sinha, conservator of forests (Gurgaon) told TOI.
 
 Dr Ashok Khasa, veterinary surgeon in the wildlife department, also said that “it was a healthy male leopard and the colour of its coat indicates it is from the   hills. It is possible that it might have reached Palwal in a truck from hills in Uttarakhand”. “We conducted a thorough medical examination of the big cat and found it was fit to be released,” he added.
 
 Experts, on the other hand, feel that coat could be lighter due to various reasons. “Lighter coat is due to melanin formation. It doesn’t tell the habitat of a leopard. A leopard can come from anywhere. However, it is any day better to rehabilitate the big cat in the Shivalik hills, than the Aravalis. Leopard is an extremely intelligent animal so it is not difficult for it to hunt in hills. As long as the animal is able to hunt and is healthy, it can be released in any protected forest area,” said Amit Chaudhery from People for Animal (PFA), Gurgaon.
