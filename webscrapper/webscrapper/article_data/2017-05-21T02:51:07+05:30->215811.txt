NEW DELHI: The central   has prohibited states from issuing manufacturing licences to new drugs, particularly fixed dose combinations (FDCs), unless approval has been granted by the   controller general of India ( ).

 The order comes in the wake of the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority’s (NPPA’s) crackdown on leading pharmaceutical companies found selling over 200 medicines without price approval.
 
 The pricing authority alleged most of these medicines were FDCs, and raised doubts on whether they had been approved by the DCGI.
 
 Pharmaceutical companies often launch new drugs after tweaking drug formulations by combining them with other medicines to circumvent price control. 
 
 Since manufacturing licences can be sought more easily from state authorities than from the Centre, owing to the scrutiny undertaken by the latter, companies often opt to go through states before launching a drug.
 
 However, through the new order, the drug quality regulator has directed states to refuse to grant manufacturing licences for new drugs without the DCGI’s approval.
 
 “Drug regulators of some of the manufacturing states have complained that the licensing authorities of certain states and UTs continue to grant licences for the manufacture of new drugs, including FDCs, without prior approval of the DCG(I),” the regulator said in a recent letter to all state drug regulators. 
 
 It added that the practice was “illegal and not in conformity with the law and would have disastrous consequences”.
