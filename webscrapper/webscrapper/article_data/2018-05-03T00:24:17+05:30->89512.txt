 A total of 77,000 students had appeared for the agriculture entrance test in this year’s Eamcet entrance examination.

 Talking to TOI, Supriya who is studying at Chaitanya College in Visakhapatnam, said, “I was definitely hoping to break into the top ten. However, topping the list was something that I did not expect at all.” Regarding the effort that went into her preparation, Supriya said she studied for no less than 13 hours a day and was glad that her hard work is paying off.
 
 Supriya’s father J Varahala Guptaji, an engineer with the Hinduja power plant and an ex-Railways employee, could hardly contain his joy. “Though I’m an engineer, I wanted to become a doctor, it was my childhood dream. Now, both my children are making this dream come true,” Guptaji said. Supriya credited her mother J Kameswari for being a constant source of encouragement. “My mother helped me a lot through the last two years. Constantly egging me on and encouraging me to do well, she ensured I was always in a positive frame of mind,” Supriya said.
 
 Asked about her tight study schedule, she said, “I used to enjoy playing chess and reading books, but now it is all academics. However, with my hard work paying off, I have no regrets whatsoever. I wish to keep the good form going and do well in the upcoming NEET and AIIMS entrance tests,” Supriya said.
