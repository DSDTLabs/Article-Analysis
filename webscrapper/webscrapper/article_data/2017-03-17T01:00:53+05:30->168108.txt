PATNA: Terror suspect Shivam Soni, who was arrested from Karor Khanjapur village in Begusarai district on Tuesday, told police during interrogation that explosives were filled in a 12-inch long tubular structure to blow up railway tracks near Kanpur, which resulted in derailment of Indore-Patna Express on November 2 last year. At least 150 passengers had lost their lives in the incident.   According to police sources, Soni also revealed that he had placed two large stone slabs along with few others from Uttar Pradesh on railway tracks between Sathajagat and Dalsingsarai stations of Sonepur division of East Central Railway in Bihar last year. However, the slabs were spotted by railway employees and a major accident was averted.    During interrogation, Soni told police that he tied nuptial knot with a girl of a very poor family in Begusarai for using the place as his safe haven.    Sources said Soni came in contact with his Jaunpur-based handler in 2015 who had promised him huge money for sabotaging railway tracks. “He has so far not given much information about his Jaunpur-based handler,” said a source.    Sources also said that the five-six Uttar Pradesh people for whom Soni used to work, might be the persons Umashankar Patel, Motilal Paswan and Mukesh Yadav had mentioned about during interrogation after their arrest from Motihari in January. Motilal had told police that a separate team had joined them at Kanpur for sabotaging the tracks.    Meanwhile, an NIA team has reached Begusarai to interrogate Soni. Sources in Uttar Pradesh Police said no one in the neighbourhood of Soni at Karakat in Jaunpur district could reveal anything about him as he was not living in the locality from a very long time.    The police are also trying to get the details of the agency which issued fake Aadhaar card to Soni.
