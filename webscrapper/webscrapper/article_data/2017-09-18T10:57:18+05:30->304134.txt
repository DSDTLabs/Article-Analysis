CHENNAI: A consumer court in Chennai came to the aid of a man whose car could not be repaired for four years as the   company refused to clear Rs 2.92 lakh as damage claims. The company has been asked to pay Rs 1 lakh for not processing the claims.

 The case pertains to B   who purchased the car from a dealer in   in March 2012. It was insured with   from March 2013 to February 2014. In 2013, Ramalingam was driving to Villupuram when a stone hit the chassis of the vehicle due to which there was leakage of oil. He informed the dealer and was informed that the cost of repairs would be Rs 2.92 lakh.
 
 However, Bajaj Allianz appointed a surveyor who assessed the damage and offered a settlement of only Rs 10,439. The company stated that Ramalingam drove the car after the oil was drained, which caused consequential damage to the engine.
 
 The Chennai (North) district consumer redressal forum rubbished the surveyor report. The bench headed by president   said the dealer had given a statement that the car was damaged by an external factor and repairs would be covered by the insurance firm.
 
 “No evidence has been provided to support the surveyor's report and hence it is rejected,“ the forum said.As a result, the insurance firm was ordered to pay the Rs 2.92 lakh to the dealer for repairing the vehicle and also a sum of Rs 1 lakh to the complainant for committing deficiency in service by rejecting the claim.
