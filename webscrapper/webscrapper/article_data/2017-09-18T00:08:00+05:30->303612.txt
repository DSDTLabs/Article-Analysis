Pune: A gang of six dacoits barged into three houses at Savindane village in Shirur taluka, about 70km from here, and robbed cash and gold ornaments collectively worth Rs1.23 lakh on Saturday.

 They also beat up three persons, including a 60-year-old woman.
 
 Phulbai Waykar, who sustained injuries on her back and shoulders, lodged a complaint with the Shirur police. The dacoits also attacked Dattatreya Kadam and Ramdas Padval. The police have registered an offence under section 395 (dacoity) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 The police said Waykar stays alone in her Pokle Vasti house. Her son and daughter-in-law stay in Talegaon-Dhamdhere. “Waykar slept outside her house on Friday night. She had locked the house from the outside,” an officer from the Shirur police said.
 
 On Saturday around 3am, the dacoits woke her up. They were carrying iron rods and sharp weapons. “One of them snatched the keys of her house and opened the lock. The others lifted the bed along with Waykar and took her inside the house,” the officer said.
 
 The suspects then demanded valuables from her. “When Waykar said she did not have any valuables at home, the suspects thrashed her with the iron rods,” the officer said.
 
 The suspects then snatched Waykar’s gold chain and earrings worth Rs15,000 in total. They searched the cupboards in the house and found cash of Rs4,000. “Before leaving the house, the suspects locked Waykar inside,” the officer added.
 
 The suspects then barged into Kadam’s house and snatched gold chains and ear rings from the women in the house and robbed them of cash, collectively worth Rs80,000. “The suspects then moved on to into Padval’s house and robbed gold and silver ornaments worth Rs25,000 and fled,” the officer said.
 
 Waykar raised an alarm some time after the dacoits left. Her neighbours opened the lock and rescued Waykar.
