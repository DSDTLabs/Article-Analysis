CHENNAI: At least a week after a division bench of the Madras high court directed the CB-CID to inquire into the misappropriation of ?2.30 crore by lawyer  , who represented the families of a few victims of the   school fire tragedy in 2004, a team of CB-CID police from   conducted a surprise raid at the lawyer’s house in   on Sunday.

 
 Led by deputy superintendent ii of police (DSP) Thangavelu, the team visited the lawyer’s house when neither the lawyer nor his family members were present. Police personnel took the house key from the security guard and skimmed through the house.
 
 CB-CID officials are believed to have videographed the cheques and documents seized from the   residence. The case was that the advocate swindled ?2.30 lakh of the compensation of ?8.01 lakh deposited in 2016 to the account of U Marimuthu, whose son   died in the fire.
 
 Tamilarasan had allegedly obtained two undated cheques and signed blank papers from the claimants and used them to withdraw a part of the compensation and diverted the funds to accounts of his relatives. It came to light thereafter that more than ?2 crore was siphoned from various victims’ families in a similar fashion.
