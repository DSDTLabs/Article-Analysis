COIMBATORE: As part of a series of educational reforms that the state government has been working on to implement from the next academic year, the school education department will upload the contents of text books for the first time along with video lessons in a mobile-compatible website. 

 In order to inculcate digitisation among school students, the department has embedded QR code in all textbooks and work books that the   (SCERT) has designed as a part of upgraded syllabus. The board has upgraded syllabus for Classes I, VI, IX and XI and it will be implemented in the coming academic year.
 
 Once the process of creating e-content is over, the entire work related to upgradation will be completed, a source in the school education department said. The process of mapping the QR codes to the website address is also completed. 
 
 "Depending on the difficulty of the topics and sub topics, a chapter will have four to five videos," said a government school teacher who is involved in creating the e-content of the syllabus.
