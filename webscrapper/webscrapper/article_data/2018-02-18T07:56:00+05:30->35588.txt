GURUGRAM: A city court on Saturday ordered a status quo on a park in  , where an alleged attempt by the   to fell trees sparked a protest last week and prompted residents to take recourse to legal options.

 After hearing the appeal of the residents who challenged an earlier order in favour of the developer who seeks to ‘reclaim’ the park in Block C for setting up a dispensary there, the court stayed all activities that might affect the greenery on the said plot till the next hearing on February 23.
 
 According to the residents, there are nearly 100 trees, including peepuls, silver oaks and neems, in the 1.2-acre park, which also has a playground and jogging tracks. Surrounded by two dozen homes, the park has been used for years by children, senior citizens, yoga and fitness enthusiasts. But the developer, who claimed the land was meant for a dispensary, was planning to hand it over for a multi-specialty hospital, they alleged. “There is already a functioning dispensary 200 metres away while at least six large hospitals are located in the area, each a stone’s throw from the park,” said  , a resident of Sushant Lok.
 
 Last week, the residents had filed a complaint with the police and the forest department against an alleged bid by the developer to cut trees after two bulldozers crashed into the community park. The residents said it had over 100 trees of protected species and thus a nod was required from the forest department to cut the same even as the developer claimed that the land was earmarked for a dispensary from the beginning.
