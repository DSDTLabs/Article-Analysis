KOLKATA:   is the new talk of the neighbourhood. And why shouldn’t he? Early on Sunday, the braveheart mongrel jumped on a gun-toting goon to save a member of his adopted family and chased the goons away with his barks before they could set the house ablaze.

 Neighbours, children and distant relatives have been dropping in since Sunday at the   house near Acropolis mall to take a look at the loyal dog that the family picked up from a park and gave refuge in their home. Many of them brought food for him, while a young fan brought a tennis ball for him to play with. Even the police officers who visited the house of   to start investigation asked about the dog and clicked his pictures.
 
 Oblivious to the adulation, Gulgul (thus named for a sound he use to make as a puppy) has been sniffing every guest before disappearing to the terrace to soak in the winter sun. 
 
 Early on Sunday, goons raided Roy’s Kasba home and fired at his mother Shila when she tried to raise the alarm, but Gulgul jumped on the gun-toting goon, spoiling his aim. His incessant barks chased away the goons, who were trying to set the house ablaze to settle a score over a dispute over a four-cottah plot. 
 
 “He not only saved my mother but all of us because the goons were trying to set our house on fire. If Gulgul had not alerted us with his barks, we would not be alive today. All of us are indebted to him,” said Roy.
 
 On Monday, Roy’s wife treated Gulgul to a special treat of mutton liver with rice and a piece of cake for his extraordinary act of bravery. The couple, who earlier had a Labrador, had picked up Gulgul from   around four years ago. Since then, he has been a part of the family. 
 
 Gulgul was edgy and nervous for the whole of Sunday. “I think he was traumatised by the incident too. He was following us everywhere throughout the day. He seems better today,” said Shila.
