Panaji: Purple Pebble Pictures co-owned by Bollywood actor Priyanka Chopra and her mother will produce a children’s feature film in Konkani-Hindi, set in Goa. Twenty-eight-year-old Suvrata Nasnodkar, who grew up in Porvorim before her love for films took her to Mumbai, is ecstatic about having her first film produced by Chopra. Currently in the pre-production stage, ‘Little Joe’ will be shot in the state and is Nasnodkar’s “ode to Goa and her childhood spent here”.  “The film celebrates childhood and is modelled on friendship. Kids should be able to watch good films that celebrate life and childhood. The elderly too want to relive their childhood,” she told TOI.
