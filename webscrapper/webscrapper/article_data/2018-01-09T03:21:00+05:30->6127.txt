Visakhapatnam: A 17-year-old hotel management student, P Raja Ramakrishna Chinna Swami Naidu, from the old city has become a role model for people of his age group by storing antique items owned by his ancestors.

 Naidu has kept all the items in two rooms in which his great grandfather Chinna Swami Naidu stayed at his heritage house near Kanaka Mahalakshmi temple in old city.
 
 TOI visited the house to see the   that included gramaphone, brass and copper utensils, vintage handicraft, foreign and Indian rare books on law and encyclopaedias (1880-2017), among other items.
 
 Naidu said safe-keeping of the antiques has been a labour of love for him since he was eight.
 
 “I feel these antiques are the real properties my grandfather bequeathed to me. My grandparents collected rare coins and antique items. My father continued the tradition. Now I am doing it,” Naidu said. He pointed out that a flower plant at his house is 100 years old. At present he is taking care of it. 
 
 Naidu’s father Rajesh, an advocate, said most antiques are inherited from his ancestors, and he has also added a few. “I am happy to see that my son is taking responsibility and continuing the tradition,” Rajesh said. 
 
 “Anything old, rich and unique catches my attention. I go all the way to add it to my collection. I have the money to buy them from others, and if anybody is interested to share items with me, I am ready to preserve them,” Naidu said.
 
 The highlights of Naidu’s collection are an expensive Veena made of elephant ivory, gramaphone made in Japan, star edition watches, old currency notes of the two US dollars and coins from the Mughal age.
 
 “Colleting antiques is not just a hobby. It is a way of preserving the heritage. I am proud to have inherited items from my ancestors and I would like to pass them on to the next generation,” Naidu added. “I don’t display these items at public events. However, I love to display them at my school and college events,” he signed off.
