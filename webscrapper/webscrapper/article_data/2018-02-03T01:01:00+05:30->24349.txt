Madurai: With a good patronage for the Madurai-Singapore service operated by the Air India Express, the flight operator has planned to increase its frequency. The flight which was inaugurated on September 15, 2017 is currently being operated four days a week, connecting Delhi-Madurai-Singapore and vice versa. Airport sources say that green signal has been given to increase in frequency and that the operator is awaiting clearance from the directorate general of civil aviation. Once the clearance is through, the operator has to take it on from there and start the operation. Sources from the Air India Express said that the patronage was better than expected. While more than 90 per cent of the seats are filled on normal days, during festivals it is fully packed. “Not just for Singapore, the patronage for Delhi is good as well. We were confident about the potential for more service connecting Singapore, right from the first week of the inauguration,” an official said. Apart from passengers, large quantities of cargo are also being lifted to Singapore. The cargo operations were inaugurated at Madurai airport on December 15. Air India Express began utilising it days before the Pongal festival this year. It also proposed to add three more services to the Kochi-Madurai-Singapore to the existing four days a week service. If things fall in place, the operations for more services will begin soon. Singapore is the only country among the Southeast Asian countries to be connected with a direct flight with Madurai. Apart from Singapore, Madurai has got direct connections to Colombo and Dubai.
