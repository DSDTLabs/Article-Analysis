Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is set to procure two new cars for its functionaries. The civic body is set to procure two Toyota Innova Crysta cars after a proposal in this regard was cleared by its standing committee.

 The VMC had in October cleared a proposal to give a car to the leader of the ruling party in the civic body. The proposal was made on the grounds that statutory functionaries of the elected body with like mayor, deputy mayor and standing committee chairperson were already being given official cars. The leader of opposition was being given a car as per tradition, but VMC did not give a car to the leader of the ruling party even as this was being done in other civic bodies.
 
 While the decision was taken on October, the ruling BJP’s leader Nilesh Rathod was given a used car from the existing pool of vehicles of the civic body. The proposal cleared on Friday seeks that a new car should be procured for the ruling party’s leader.
 
 Another proposal was brought to procure a new car for the VMC commissioner. The commissioner’s car is three years old and there are difficulties with its maintenance. At times, the car stays in the workshop as spares of the particular model are not available.
 
 The decision to procure the new car for the leader of the ruling party has, however, raised eyebrows. The car would be newer and better than those being used by other elected functionaries of the civic body. Many believe that he may not actually use it and may swap it with someone senior.
 
 The civic body will be spending over Rs 18 lakh per car. These cars are being procured at government rates.
