Rajkot: Over 400 college and school students on Wednesday morning protested at the Gondal Depot in Rajkot over few buses plying on the Gondal-Rajkot route. 

 They claimed that all buses were sent to Somnath and Gandhinagar for Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s progrmmes, hence they did not have buses to go to college in Rajkot. On Wednesday, the students did not allow the buses to go out of the station for nearly three hours. After intervention of police and assurance from Gondal depot manager, the students dispersed and operations resumed to normal.
