TRICHY: It's the season of farm fresh   and  , especially those hailing from the urban areas, have been increasingly plumping for the fruit to stay away from diseases. 

 For 35-year-old Chandru, a fruit vendor from Samayapuram, guava fruits directly procured from the farms have brought good income for the past three months. The freshness of the fruit has attracted customers who are ready to buy it even for a higher price.
 
 "The attraction here is the freshness of the fruits plucked daily from the trees and sold the same day. Hence, the real flavour of the fruit won't change and the people can taste its original sweetness," said Chandru who along with his wife needs about half a day to sell their entire cart of the fruit on  . 
 
 Though the vendors claim that the fruits are farm fresh, it is normal for customers to doubt it. In order to clear any such apprehensions, the vendors display the fruit along with the shoot to show its freshness. "Customers have all rights to check the quality of the fruit. They first taste the fruit and buy them," Mariappan, another guava fruit vendor from Trichy, said. 
 
 The vendors procure the guava from farms around Trichy and Ariyalur. However, the vegetable outlets procure them from the wholesale market which could only give them the fruits stored a few days before. With the people growing health conscious, the search is mostly for organically grown vegetables and fresh fruits to stay healthy. 
 
 "Apart from its nutritious value, I also get the satisfaction of helping a street vendor whose livelihood depends on the sale of his fruits," said Saravanan, a customer.
