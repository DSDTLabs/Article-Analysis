GUWAHATI: Buoyed by the Tamil Nadu government's move to allow  , the Ahatguri Moh Juj Aru Bhogali Utsav Udjapan Samiti has decided to formally organize the state's traditional moh juj or buffalo fight at Ahatguri in Morigaon district on Friday. 

 "With the Tamil Nadu government's ordinance allowing the sport, there is no reason why we should not organize our own moh juj. After all, it is an integral part of our life in Assam," secretary of the organization   said.
 
 Buffalo fights are organized in the state from the first day of the month of Magh.
 
 The Samiti organizes one of the largest buffalo fights of the state at Ahatguri. 
 
 However, this time, it refrained from holding the event on the first day of Magh (January 15) in deference to the   ban. Many owners and keepers of buffaloes did organize fights but they were low-key affairs and did not have the approval of committees like the Samiti which have traditionally been the main organizers of such events.
 
 "We are ready to hold moh juj at Ahatguri. We have very little time," another organizer said.
 
 Last week, the Samiti said the Centre's approval of the Tamil Nadu government's ordinance and subsequently holding of jallikattu had raised the hope for buffalo fight in Assam. "The developments in Tamil Nadu will have a positive impact here," Das had said.
 
 Authorities of the 16th century Hayagriva Madhava temple at Hajo, about 55 km from here, have also appealed to the state government to allow the traditional bulbul (songbird) fights which are held on the first day of Magh. 
 
 The temple has, for the third consecutive year, abstained from holding the traditional the bulbul fight since the Supreme Court ban.
 
 Forest and environment minister   said the government would look into the issue.
