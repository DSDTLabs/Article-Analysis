KANPUR:  , who has been removed as   state chief, said he will contest elections from his traditional   seat. 

 “I will contest election from Jaswantnagar assembly seat and expect a big win,” said Shivpal while addressing party workers at SS Memorial School in Saifai, his native village, on Thursday.
 
 Shivpal said, “I was least interested in fighting elections this time, but it’s the love of the people of Jaswantnagar that has forced me to change my decision.” 
 
 He, however, did not forget to alert the workers. “Money and muscle power can be used for ruining my fortunes, but as Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav) is with me, none can dare to do so.”
 
 He also recalled that how he and Netaji had worked hard for raising and establishing the SP. “I along with Netaji had canvassed on bicycle and motorcycle for the party and also went to jail several times for its cause,” he added.
 
 “Now, some people are hell-bent on damaging the prospects of the party. But I and Netaji will not let it happen. Everybody is with Netaji, and we will for sure make a strong comeback in Assembly elections,” he said. 
 
 This was the first time when Shivpal reached Saifai and addressed party workers since he had been removed from SP post.
 
 His name was added to a list of 38 candidates sent by Mulayam to Akhilesh Yadav, who has been recognised by the   as the Samajwadi Party chief and has been allowed to use ‘cycle’ symbol.
