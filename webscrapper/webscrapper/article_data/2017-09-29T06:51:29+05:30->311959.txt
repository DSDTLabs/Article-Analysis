BENGALURU: Newly elected mayor   is taking the reins at the height of  , in the   He appears to have his plan of action ready.

 
 
 
 My first priority would be to ensure that all emergency repairs take place, as I don't want people to be inconvenienced or suffer more than they have. Work on   is underway. I hope to repose the trust people have placed in me. The city's population has increased manifold and new villages have been added to BBMP limits. There is a lot of work to be done. All Indira Canteens will be ready in two months.
 
 
 
 We will introduce several good programmes for the public. Bengaluru is an IT City and known for its educational opportunities. We will ensure that there are more of these for children, especially girls.For public safety, especially working women, we will ensure that CCTV cameras are fixed at all major roads and junctions within a month. We will collaborate with corporates to get funds and improve facilities for BBMP schools under their CSR initiative.
 
 
 
 All 198 corporators should know that everything they say and do at the council meetings is being watched by the citizens. They know who is working and who is not. The opposition is there to oppose our schemes and policies but from our side, we have always worked according to the law and will continue to do so.
 
 
 
 It is the one thing I want to change in the city in the next year. It will be my area of focus. The problems with contractors and others have to be resolved. We will hold meetings with officials and find a solution that works.
 
 
 
 
 I will ensure something is done about it within 15 days.We will ensure good work in all wards.
