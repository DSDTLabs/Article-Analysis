HYDERABAD: Expressing serious concern over inordinate delay in the completion of several projects, MPs from   met   railway general manager   on Wednesday. Ahead of the railway and general budgets, the MPs submitted a slew of demands to be included in the budget for allocation. 

 "The   is top in revenue earning but has been indifferent in resolving pending issues. The Nalgonda-Macherla line was sanctioned in 1997, but even after 20 years, the project is yet to see the light of the day. Similarly, the Pagidipalli- Nallapadu doubling works are yet to be taken up. Same is the case with the Jaggayyapet-Mellachervu passenger line, which on becoming a reality will reduce the distance between Hyderabad and   drastically,"   MP Gutta Sukender Reddy told TOI. The MPs expressed displeasure over delay even in small works to which the GM responded by stating that he would write to the railway board on all issues. "Does the change of lights in a railway station also require the approval of the railway board? We have been asking a small road to the goods shed and the GM says it require permission from the board. If everything is to come from the railway board, when will these issues be resolved," wondered an MP. 
 
 TRS MPs requested for a study on the proposal to lay a new line between Kazipet-Karimnagar via Huzurabad. Congress Rajya Sabha MP Rapolu Ananda Bhaskar asked for special trains for the Medaram Jatara.
