Films on reincarnation are few and far between in Tollywood. Sonar Kella, Kshudhito Pashan and Jaatishwar are rare examples that deal with life and death as a continuous chain, and stay on the must-watch list of movie lovers. 
Despite their encouraging feedback, not many directors took the risk of telling a story on the subject. Come April, debutant directors   and Abhishek will explore the genre with their new film,  , starring   in the lead.
 Says Meenakshii, an energy worker and occult specialist, about her first film that has overtones of Gothic and noir, “It’s about two stories set in two eras — 1960s and the modern times — with a common link. A film on reincarnation, it’s about the unknown. When there’s fog, you can’t see anything. And then, when it moves, everything around gets crystal clear. Our film deals with this mist in life.” 
 Gargee plays Rajeshwari, a mysterious character in this ‘paranormal romance’. “I am a spiritual person and could immediately connect with the story. Also, I am in that phase in my career where I can take risks; the decision to work with a new set of directors is one such,” she said. 
 A believer in life after death, Gargee said her intuition is very strong. “Often, when I meet people, I feel I have seen them somewhere. It has always turned out that we had some connection through family or friends. Also, I strongly feel that if you love someone with all your heart, you are bound to end up with him,” said the actress. 
 The script of the film is penned by  , while music is scored by Chirantan. The film also stars newcomer Rishav, apart from Anindya Pulak Banerjee, Sudeshna Roy, Shoan, Manali and Soumitra Ray of Bhoomi.
