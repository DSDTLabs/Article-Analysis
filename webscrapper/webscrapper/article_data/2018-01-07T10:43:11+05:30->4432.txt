 Paul, who has been gaining attention for his performance in films like Solo and   through impressive character roles, will soon debut as a hero in Kollywood. 

 His leading lady will be the Big Boss fame Malayali girl  . The actor has already started shooting for the film, which is directed by Anita Udeep.
 “It’s a romcom and it feels great to work in Tamil as a hero, after working in Remo,” says Anson, about the untitled film, which would get christened around February. The actor seems to be at home working with Oviya, who also hails from his native place, Thrissur. “In fact, we are from the same locality in Thrissur. She mentioned that we went to the same church as well! It's great working with her,” Anson says. In Malayalam, he has also just wrapped up his debut hero project, Kala Viplavam Pranayam. 
 
 The actor, who played the villainous role of Anali Sabu in   2 is also thrilled about his performance getting lauded. “Actor Vijay Babu is like a brother to me and previously, I had told him that I would have loved to be part of Aadu. Actually, Appani Sarath was supposed to play Anali Sabu, but I guess his dates didn’t work out. After Solo, I was on a break and was also growing my hair and beard for fun, also wondering whether I can take up roles in the new look. I guess the universe conspired to land me two projects — Kala Viplavam Pranayam and Aadu 2 in this look,” he says.
 
 Though he is trying a variety of new stunts in the film including dance, Anson says that bringing on the body language of Anali Sabu was the biggest challenge. “Also, I was curious to learn why Sabu was called Anali. While director Midhun initially said that there isn’t much of a story behind the name, it was later included and I guess that helped as well,” he says. 
 
 In Mammootty’s upcoming film Abrahaminte Santhathikal, Anson plays the megastar’s brother. “It’s the character in Solo that paved the way for all these roles,” he says.
