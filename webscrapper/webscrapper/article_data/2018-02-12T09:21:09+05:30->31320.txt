  : Senior   said on Sunday that his party will not enter any pre-poll or post-poll alliance in Meghalaya. 

 "BJP will fight the election on its own," Rudy said. The former Union minister was in the city to campaign for the BJP candidate in the North Shillong constituency. Rudy's comment assumes significance in light of the fact that the National People's Party (NPP), which has emerged as a major contender for power in the Congress-ruled state, has also maintained that it will not consider an alliance with any party in the state.
 
 The NPP, which is part of the BJP-led NDA at the Centre and also shares power with the BJP in Manipur, has pitted candidates against the BJP in several constituencies, most notably in South Tura, where the late PA Sangma's daughter Agatha Sangma is pitted against the BJP's  . Political speculation, however, is rife that the NPP will ultimately tie up with the BJP to keep the   out of power as was the case in neighbouring Manipur.
