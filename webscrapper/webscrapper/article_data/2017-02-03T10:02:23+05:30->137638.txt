NAGPUR: The   was in complete disarray with infighting taking centrestage on the penultimate day of filing nominations for he NMC elections.

 The state party headquarters in Mumbai was the scene of action. The party’s city office at Devadia Bhavan was locked as leaders were away in Mumbai pushing for inclusion of their respective followers in the candidates’ list for NMC polls.
 
 Till late Thursday evening, there was no consensus and no names were announced as the Congress parliamentary board’s efforts to put together a final list met with stiff resistance from a faction leaders. All that the media and prospective candidates have been hearing for the last two days from Mumbai are juicy stories of scuffles breaking out between factions.
 
 The latest was a tiff between former minister   and MPCC president  , who reportedly did not allow the former a say in tickets for East Nagpur wards. Miffed on being ignored despite representing the constituency for over two decades, Chaturvedi walked out of the meeting in a huff.
 
 Insiders said a tentative list was ready on Wednesday but then a duel was witnessed at the parliamentary board meeting between former MP Vilas Muttemwar and ex-minister Anees Ahmed over some names.
 
 Soon, there was a heated argument between city Congress president Vilas Thakre and sitting corporator  , with both sticking to their guns. After these disputes, the exercise of revising the list began afresh.
 
 MPCC observer   told TOI that the process of finalization of names was underway. “It may get very late tonight (Thursday). After that, AB forms will be prepared with candidates’ names printed on them. We will try to send the forms by Friday morning,” he added.
 
 Thakre said there was no chance of any list being declared for public. “The selected candidates will be intimated by Friday morning and will be asked to reach their respective NMC zone offices for filing nominations, along with AB forms,” he said.
