VADODARA: The next time your valuables are  , the first thing that the government railway police (GRP) will do is scan the database of  . If they come across any suspect, they would know where to look for him or her. 

 Wary of the thefts in trains, the Vadodara division of GRP has begun collecting data of the vendors and port attendants moving on the railway station and in the trains. 
 
 GRP officials said that names, identity cards, phone numbers and addresses of nearly 700 vendors and port attendants have already been collected and the process is still on. 
 
 “We have been collecting the data since months on directions of western railway superintendent of police,  . The idea is to have complete details of those who move around frequently in the trains and at railway stations. In case any crime occurs, such data always comes in handy,” said S J Rajput, police inspector, LCB, western railways. 
 
 The police said that when any theft occurs in the trains, some of the first suspects are vendors, many of whom don’t have proper permissions from the railway department.
 
  “They frequent the trains and have access to the coaches even during night time. So they are on the suspect list. When any theft occurs, we simply have to show their photos to the complainant. If identified, arresting the suspect becomes easier,” GRP officials said. All the data including photos collected by the GRP is fed in the ‘Vadodara Railway Police’ app. 
 
 The app has been launched by the GRP to ensure that railway passengers get prompt help in case any crime or other issue happens during the travel. 
 
 “Selling anything without proper permissions is also illegal at railway stations. We will be able to identify illegal vendors with this new system,” a GRP official added.
