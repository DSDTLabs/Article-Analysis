THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Hotels and restaurants in the state are yet follow the government decision to reduce the rate of many items after GST came into effect on July 1. Finance minister T M   has urged officials to book those establishments that are overcharging consumers. He pointed out that Kerala State Film Development Corporation (KSFDC) and   ( ) had set an example for others by reducing prices of film tickets and chicken meat respectively. 

 Officials in the finance department said that they had recently received numerous complaints against hotels that have not lowered the rate. The sales tax department has started inspecting hotels and restaurants in the state and in the coming day's notices will be issued to establishments that do not follow government orders.
 
 The finance minister said that government agencies have started reducing the price. He said Kepco has abolished the 14% tax levied on chicken. As a result, a kilo of chicken now costs Rs 153 (skinless), the earlier rate was Rs 175. Similar rate reduction has been implemented in other chicken products sold by Kepco.
 
 He underlined this change while saying that this had happened when the price of chicken had increased in the open market after the rollout of GST. It has proved that the chicken traders were fleecing customers in the name of GST. Now they will have to face action, Isaac said.
 
 Similarly, KSFDC has lowered the ticket rates at their film theatres. The entertainment tax collected by the local self-governments has been stopped and a ticket that was priced at Rs 103 will now cost only Rs 78.
 
 "The models set by Kepco and KSFDC should be emulated by others in the industry or the government would be forced to take action," said the finance minister.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP state president Kummanam Rajasekharan has urged the government to act tough against traders and hotel owners who were overcharging under the guise of GST.
