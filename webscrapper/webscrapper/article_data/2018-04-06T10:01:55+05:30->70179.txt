MUMBAI: Mumbai’s loss, it seems, has been Australia’s gain. Last month,   had resigned as the spin bowling coach of the   ( ) academy at BKC after being denied the opportunity to conduct a camp for budding spinners. On Thursday, TOI learnt that the former India and Mumbai off-spinner had been roped in by Cricket   (CA) to coach its young spinners. Interestingly, Powar’s name for the job was proposed by none other than Australian batting legend and former India coach Greg Chappell.

 
 Powar is the second Indian cricketer after former Tamil Nadu cricketer Sridharan Sriram, who was recruited by the Kangaroos last year as their spin bowling coach.
 
 “I am happy to inform you that I have been invited by CA to Brisbane in June to coach young spinners,” Powar told TOI on Thursday. The 39-year-old played two Tests and 31 ODIs for India from 2004 to 2007, in which he took six and 34 wickets. At the First-Class level though, the burly spinner enjoyed an epic career, taking 470 wickets in 148 games to emerge as a matchwinner for Mumbai for around 15 years. “It was Chappell who recommended my name to CA. I thank him and Troy Cooley, head coach of their National Performance Programme, for giving me the opportunity,” he added.
 
 Many countries are turning to India or Indians to learn how to bowl and play spin. Last month, Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced a squad of players and coaches that will attend a spin bowling camp in the city from April 28 to May 6, ahead of South Africa A’s tour to India later this year. “The squad is a mixture of youth and experience headed by many of South Africa’s senior spin bowlers such as Keshav Maharaj, Dane Piedt and Tabraiz Shamsi, Proteas batsman Temba Bavuma plus senior coaches Malibongwe Maketa, Claude Henderson and Russell Domingo (former South African national team coach),” said the CSA release. “Several senior players, who have been to this camp before, appreciate its value and have asked to be included again,” added the release.
