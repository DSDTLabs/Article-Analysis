Bengaluru: Chief minister   on Thursday said it was the responsibility of every Kannadiga to watch   in addition to other languages.

 At the inauguration of the 9th   held on the grand steps of Vidhana Soudha, Siddaramaiah was candid about the quality of Kannada films being made. “When we look at the Kannada film industry there is a serious question about how many of the movies released every year have quality? Kannada movies need to provide a good message to the people and not be crass entertainers,” he said.
 
 Siddaramaiah said, “There are a lot of good movies that need to be watched by Kannadigas. I do not say that people should not watch other language movies but on that pretext do not avoid going to Kannada movies.”
 
 Earlier, film industry veterans urged Siddaramaiah to call a meeting to address the concern of multiplexes eating into the Kannada movie revenues as they do not provide prime-time slots.
 
 Siddaramaiah said he would call a meeting between representatives of multiplexes and the Kannada film industry shortly.
 
 A laser show mapping the film industry in India and Karnataka was organised on the occasion.
