UDUPI: Karnataka revenue minister   on Wednesday inaugurated three new taluks — Byndoor,   and Kaup — of   district, taking the total to seven. It already has Udupi, Kundapur and Karkala taluks. Though Hebri was also declared a new taluk, it’ll be inaugurated later. 

 People of these places had been demanding new taluks for many years.
 
 Thimmappa said, "People expect a clean and transparent administration. Accordingly, the state government works towards implementing changes. But, if work doesn’t happen, it’s bad for the government and an insult to the CM. Officials must follow government orders and implement them. The PDOs and EOs should conduct the required surveys and provide title deeds to the needy.”
 
 He added: "There should not be any caste discrimination in providing land. If officials help provide land to the poor, they don't have to go to Dharmasthala, Tirupati or any other temple to get blessings. Official’s laziness won’t be tolerated. I’m also working on issues related to deemed forest. Kumki land will be provided to the homeless poor under Revenue Act 79-2. Officials have been instructed to process applications without fear.   land will be made available and given title deeds. There is no issue under   land. We’ll have a discussion with ministers concerned about government land which is in temples.” 
 
 Mangalore and Udupi will soon have a new sand mining policy. Sakala applications are cleared up to 99%. We’ll build a mini Vidhan Soudha soon at Byndoor and Brahmavar, he added.
