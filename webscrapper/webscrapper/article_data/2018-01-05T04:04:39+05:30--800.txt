NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday said it was in favour of repealing the   Offenders Act, which would bring reprieve for de-notified and nomadic tribes. Responding to a question from noted lawyer K T S   in the  , junior minister for social justice and empowerment   said, “A commission that was formed in 2015 made a reference in this regard in its interim report. 

 The final report is expected in the next few days (on June 8). I think a proposal to repeal this act will come and the government is favour of repealing this law.” Earlier, other members 
 
 had raised questions about the law, which they said stigmatised certain communities as criminals. This act classifies certain tribes as hereditary criminals, depriving them of affirmative actions by the government and these include pardhis, kanjars and vanjaras.
