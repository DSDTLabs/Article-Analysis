CHENNAI: The city police on Monday booked three AIADMK ( ) leaders including former education minister ‘Ma Foi’ K Pandiarajan and Dr Azhagu Muthuselvi for ‘dishonouring’ the national flag after the party campaigned with a replica of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s coffin covered with the tricolour.

 They carried a miniature of Jayalalithaa’s ‘body’ and kept it for “public homage” in Rajaji Hall. 
 
 The campaigner of the OPS-faction responsible, Azhagu Tamilselvi, addressed voters of RK Nagar on April 6 and sought their support.
 
 The rival factions criticised the OPS group for the campaign. Police took action soon after, removing the dummy coffin and stopping the rally. Complaints were filed with the returning officer who, in turn, lodged a complaint at the RK Nagar police station.
 
 Many images of the procession with the dummy, including that of Azhagu Muthuselvi addressing the gathering with Pandiarajan, were circulated on social media.
 
 The move by the OPS-faction drew criticism from all sides on social networking sites. Based on the returning officer’s complaint, police registered a case under IPC Section 171F (punishment for undue influence or imper- sonation at an election) read with Section 123 (corrupt practices) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and under the provisions of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, against   Pandiarajan, Azhagu Muthuselvi and alocal functionary, Kuppan.
