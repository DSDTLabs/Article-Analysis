HYDERABAD: As many as 38 stall holders operating within  's   have been served eviction notices by the tehsildar and estate officer of Serilingampally mandal for "illegally" occupying the space. 

 This was brought to light by Shilparamam officials through a communication released on Wednesday, which stated that the entire operation was conducted in the presence of revenue officials and police personnel from the   police station. Earlier, 13 stall holders had vacated the premises while Shilparamam took possession of 20 more stalls, left vacant for a long time, the release read. 
 
 The recent move comes four months after 22 traders moved the   against the state government and special officer of the tourism department, accusing them of disconnecting power supply to their stores. Shilparamam authorities had maintained that it was done after the traders failed to clear their rental dues, totalling 94 lakh. While the court subsequently quashed the plea of 16 traders, six were granted stay. 
 
 When contacted on Wednesday, members of the traders association lashed out at the revenue and police officials for sealing their shops without any prior notice. 
 
 "The officials slyly came to the premises early on Monday morning, put wax seals on the shops and threw our wares out onto the street. We were completely in the dark about it until we reached our shops and saw the sight," said Jacob Raju, president, Shilparamam  , adding that they were planning to file an appeal in the court on the matter. 
 
 The Night Bazaar, an arts and crafts market that opened over half a decade ago, has been embroiled in this conflict for years with speculations being rife about the premises being shut down to public for good.
