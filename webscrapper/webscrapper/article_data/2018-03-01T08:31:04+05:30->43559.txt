NEW DELHI: Rebuffing CBI’s summons to return to India and join the investigation in the Rs 12,600 crore PNB scam, diamantaire   has told the agency that he would not be able to do so as he was busy with his business abroad. 

 CBI had emailed the summons to   a few days ago and asked him to appear for interrogation. Without disclosing his location, Modi replied, “I have business to run here. Won’t be able to join.” 
 
 After receiving Modi’s reply on Wednesday, CBI again wrote to him and asked him to contact the Indian high commission in the country he was staying in so that he could be brought to India. “It is mandatory for all the accused to join the probe,” CBI said and asked Modi to appear before it next week. CBI officials said they would have to trace him and use the extradition route to bring him to India. 
 
 The agency may soon approach   to issue a red corner notice against Modi and  , sources said. CBI on Wednesday arrested the internal chief auditor of PNB, M K Sharma, a chief manager rank officer. “Sharma was responsible for auditing the systems and practices of PNB’s   branch and report the deficiencies to the zonal audit office,” CBI spokesperson   said. 
 
 It has been alleged that PNB officers omitted entries of letters of undertaking (LoUs) in the core banking system issued on behalf of Modi and Choksi’s companies to avoid detection. The funds raised through the LoUs were meant to be used for payment of import bills of Modi’s companies whereas it was utilised for other purposes.
