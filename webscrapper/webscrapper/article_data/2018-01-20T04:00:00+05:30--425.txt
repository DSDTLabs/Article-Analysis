Palanpur: Over a dozen farmers from Banaskantha were trained in bee keeping under the Village Based Bee Keeping and Honey Production (VBBHP) scheme of the National Bee Board (NBB). The seven-day training that ended recently was organized by NBB along with Banaskantha District Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union Ltd,  

 According to in-charge of ‘Project Honey’ at Banas Dairy Mahesh Bhatol, bee keeping is gaining momentum in Banaskantha district.
 
 “The famers are keenly interested in VBBHP as the honey production does not carry any risk and requires no huge investment. Moreover, it is free from risk of climatic changes. Also, there is almost zero possibility of loss in honey production unlike other agricultural products,” Bhatol said.
 
 He added that the dairy had to diversify into different products to sustain livelihood of farmers. “We currently have put up 1,100 beehive boxes in the district which were made available from Khadi Gramudyog Commission in Ahmedabad and state horticulture department,” Bhatol added. 
 
 Banas Dairy has so far procured 2,264 kg honey at the rate of Rs 150 per kg from local bee keepers. 
 
 “By May this year, we are expecting the yield of honey to go up to something between 15 and 20 tonne,” Bhatol said. The honey will be marketed under the brand name ‘Banas Honey’, which will be available in the package of 250 gm and 500 gm.
