VISAKHAPATNAM: Six   are reportedly being interrogated by senior officials of the maritime force for their alleged role in a question  .

 The news came to light recently after a Board of Inquiry was constituted over the issue, sources said.   authorities have reportedly not filed any case with the police regarding the matter.
  
  
 According to sources, the Coast Guard conducts a written test for general duty posts every six months. The eligibility criteria for the post is intermediate pass or equivalent. The question paper for this exam was prepared in Noida.
 
 Some employees of the Coast Guard reportedly leaked the question paper to some academies and individuals a few days before the examination, by charging a sum of Rs 2 lakh to Rs 6 lakh.
 
 
 In the last week of February an employee allegedly belonging to the Coast Guard was arrested. Authorities obtained leads from the accused and took another five persons into custody in March, most of them belonging to the Coast Guard. The Board of Inquiry consists of higher officials of the Coast Guard, sources said.
 
 The paper was allegedly leaked with the help of two civilian employees, including a driver and a crane operator, who are reportedly close to higher officials in the Coast Guard. Allegations are rife that higher officials in the Coast Guard are trying to hush up the matter.
 
 When contacted, DIG of Coast Guard district-VI, AK Harbola, said that no employee of his district was involved in any irregular or illegal practices. An independent inquiry was going on over the allegations, he added.
 
 “The system is honest and transparent. Higher authorities are already focusing on the matter,” he said.
 
 There are allegations that injustice has been done to candidates of Telugu states as the alleged question paper leak has given an opportunity to candidates from other states to get jobs.
