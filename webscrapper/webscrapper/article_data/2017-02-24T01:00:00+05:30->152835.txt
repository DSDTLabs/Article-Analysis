Picture this — a gaggle of kids dressed in school uniforms take the stage. They exude an uncontrollable energy, as they smile mischievously from behind the dim lights. On cue, they burst into an energetic folk number that takes you by surprise. Seeing The Manganiyar classroom live is sheer joy. A mix between a skit and a musical show, the kids are their naughty selves, as they belt out one folk number after another, bent on harassing their teacher. While it’s all fun and frolic, you can’t help being amazed at the talent of this 35-member strong choir, as they sing about subjects that are very real and affect these little ones — the frail and subjugating educational system of their village. These are songs from their life and they present them with gusto and talent.
