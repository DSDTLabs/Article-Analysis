PUNE: Hotel and restaurant owners of the western region want the government to level the playing field when it comes to regulations.

 The   (HRAWI) recently said that it will petition the governments of its western region to even out the field and bring uniformity in regulations for hospitality players in the market.
 
 HRAWI president   said, “Disruptions are healthy, as they allow customers to enjoy the best services at the cheapest rates. But disruptors cannot be allowed to upset the system simply on the basis of avoiding regulations and taxes. Let’s say a hotel charges Rs 1,500 for a room, then it has to pay 10% as   beside other taxes. But a bungalow listed as an online homestay network, for over Rs 10,000 a day, ends up paying nothing.”
 
 “In a country like India where tourism is at a nascent stage, the unorganized, illicit accommodation could spell doom. The primary problem is that there are no standardisations,” he added.
 
 HRAWI also questioned subjecting hotels to administrative clearances, liquor permits and other licenses while unorganized accommodations, providing the same services, are exempted.
