NEW DELHI: Social activist   on Monday alleged that chief minister   has forgotten the   movement after entering politics and said he will ask his onetime protege to keep a "safe distance" when he launches another anti-corruption agitation.

 He also targeted Puducherry lieutenant governor   and Union minister   for their failure to take the 2011movement to a successful conclusion.
 
 "We had all these people in our team. We undertook such a massive agitation. And they forgot the Lokpal because all have ventured into politics," he said. The Gandhian, whose anti-corruption protest attracted a huge outpouring of support in 2011, threatened a rerun of his crusade as he denounced the Modi government at the Centre over its "failure" to appoint a Lokpal and create a graft-free India.
 
 Hazare, who was the face of the impassioned movement for the creation of Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayukta in states to probe corruption in the government, targeted PM Modi, saying "he is averse to appoint anyone to the office".
