PANAJI: Five offshore   will get another six months to continue their operations in the Mandovi river. The state cabinet on Wednesday granted extension to the offshore casinos, while the government is expected to finalize its main policy on their relocation by December.

 Speaking to reporters after the cabinet meet, chief minister   said, “By December, we will come up with the main policy on relocation of casinos”. While a final call on relocation will be taken in December, Parrikar said discussion will start in mid-October. The extension comes into effect from October 1 and ends on March 31, 2018.
 
 The cabinet note on Wednesday stated that the five offshore casinos will be required to submit an unconditional undertaking, that they will shift the casinos out of River Mandovi whenever an alternative feasible site is finalized by the state government on or before March 31, 2018.
 
 The current permission granted to the five offshore casinos is a three-month period that ends on September 30. This permission was given as the government failed to identify an alternative site to relocate the offshore casinos.
 
 The previous BJP-led government had identified locations in the Aguada bay and Zuari, Chapora and Sal rivers. But, the proposal to shift the vessels never saw the light of day over the last two years. The proposal was shot down on grounds on non-viability. After the BJP-led government took charge in March, Parrikar said his government is committed to moving casinos out of the Mandovi river, but only after an alternative site was identified. The BJP’s coalition partners had also demanded that the offshore casinos be moved out of River Mandovi.
 
 The five offshore casino licencees are  , Goa Coastal Resorts and Recreation Pvt Ltd, Highstreet Cruises and Entertainment, Golden Peace Infrastructure Pvt Ltd and Delta Pleasure Cruise Company.
