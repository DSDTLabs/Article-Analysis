Coimbatore: The second bail petition submitted by suspended Bharathiar University vice-chancellor A Ganapathy was also rejected by the special court for prevention of corruption act here on Thursday. The court also dismissed the bail plea of the universityâ€™s Chemistry department professor Dharmaraj. 

 The earlier bail petition of Ganapathy, who has been lodged in the Coimbatore prison for the last fortnight since his arrest by the sleuths of the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) on graft charges, was dismissed on February 8.
 
 Ganapathy had once again moved court last Tuesday. His counsel argued that the suspended vice-chancellor has already been interrogated by the police and that there was no evidence to prove that he had received bribe. He also argued for Dharmaraj stating that there was no evidence to implicate him.
 
 However, the prosecution argued that further investigation was to be carried out and that evidences need to be collected. Hence, Ganapthy should be not let on bail as there was a possibility of tampering with the evidence.TNN
