MUMBAI: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences ( ) Act court on Tuesday convicted and sentenced a 30-year-old religious studies teacher to 20 years imprisonment for sodomising a 13-year-old boy and molesting his 11-year-old sister repeatedly.

 In his statement before the court, the boy said in 2015 when he used to go to the religious institution, the accused would ask other children present there to go out. He further stated the accused would show him obscene videos on his laptop. He would then tell him that he would re-enact the scenes. The child said the accused used to sexually assault him and ensured they exited the room separately.
 
 He further stated that since he was scared, he did not reveal the abuse to his parents. The matter came to light only on September 10, 2015, when his sister told their mother about the sexual abuse she faced at the hands of the accused.
 
  
  
 The boy said when his parents enquired with him, he too revealed his ordeal.
 
 During cross examination, the child denied the defence claims that the accused was being falsely implicated as there was a dispute between him and his parents. He further denied he was tutored by his mother and the cops on what to state in court.
 
 The girl too deposed before the court. She said whenever her mother was unwell, she stepped in for her and went to the religious institution to sweep and make tea. She said that one such time, the accused caught hold of her from behind. She, however, screamed, and escaped. She stated that on one occasion when she went for her religious studies, the accused said, “I love you” to her. The child has said the accused sexually abused her on two other occasions. After the mother found out that both her children had been sexually exploited by the teacher, she lodged a complaint with the police.
