MANGALURU: Disappointed over the wholesale acquittal of all the accused in the infamous attack on the  , that rocked Mangaluru in 2009, students of private colleges in the city have commenced a signature campaign.

 The signature campaign demands a detailed inquiry into lapses, where 29 accused were acquitted for lack of evidence, recently. According to the campaigners, who are students, the signatures are addressed to home minister Ramalinga Reddy, with a memorandum seeking an inquiry.
 
 Various student groups in Bengaluru and Mysuru are also set to join the campaign.
 
 Activist   has started an online signature campaign against the acquittal of the accused in the pub attack in ‘change.org’. She mentioned in her campaign that the attack on Amnesia Pub had made international headlines in the print and electronic media, and that the world witnessed the gruesome footage of the attack on young men and women.
 
 She said newspapers also carried photographs of the goons beating up the victims. “This attack also marked the onset of ‘immoral policing’ in Mangaluru, which has destroyed the foundations of civic freedoms in this region, and allowed criminal culture to flourish and terrorize citizens in general, with political backing,” she added.
 
 The campaign further added that it is distressing to note that despite such a strong video, photographic evidence and a trial lasting nearly a decade, the prosecution failed to bring the guilty to justice. “The outcome of the trial shook us, as we were expecting stringent punishment for the guilty as per law,” she said.
 
 In the campaign, they demanded that the state government take measures to prove the guilt of the accused and ensure deterrent punishment for them.
