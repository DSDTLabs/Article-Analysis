NEW DELHI: Student Union leader of  's   college has been suspended by the college after investigation by the varsity found that his admission was “wrong and mala fide”. 

 A message circulated by the college principal P V Khatri to his staff members on Monday mentioned that  's admission is cancelled "as per university directive."
 
 A complaint was filed both in the university and the   against the union president Saurabh Mann by his opponent, Sanjay who 
 alleged that Mann had been granted admission in 2016 despite “not meeting the cut-off”.
 
 Mann, a student of BA (Programme), won the post of president in the recent election of 2017. His opponent, Sanjay who lost the election alleged 'widespread corruption' in the college and complained against Mann's status as student and filed a petition in the High Court in October. An order issued by Justice Indermeet Kaur on January 10 said the “prayer made in the petition is largely satisfied” and asked the college and the election officer to enquire into the admission and also decide on his presidency “within an outer limit of six weeks”.
 
 It was also on January 8, that DU's Deputy Dean of Students’ Welfare (DSW) wrote to the college principal demanding answers on Mann's admission. 
 
 "Enquiries by the university, including replies from your office, show that it is prima facie a case of wrong and mala fide admission. The committee, therefore, recommends immediate suspension of admission of Mann, pending detailed enquiry by your office, which must be completed within 10 days of the issuance of the letter,” the letter signed by deputy DSW Gurpreet Tuteja said.
