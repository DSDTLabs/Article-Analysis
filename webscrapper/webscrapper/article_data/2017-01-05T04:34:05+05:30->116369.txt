GURUGRAM: Rajput Mahasabha has agreed to shift the   of its legendary leader from   Chowk, paving the way for construction of the proposed   that will pass over this perennially congested traffic junction.

 Huda, on its part, has agreed to provide required land for reinstalling the Maharana Pratap’s statue around three-four kilometre away at Leisure Valley Park in Sector 29, one of the biggest and prominent free-time destinations in the city.
 
 The statue, which was installed by the Mahasabha in 2002, has been posing hurdle for the alignment of the Rs 126-crore flyover to be constructed on the stretch between Signature Tower and Atul Kataria Chowk. 
 
 It is likely to start from near MDI gate and end near Sector 17 gate and help streamline vehicular movement on MG Road from the local bus stand to Iffco Chowk.
 
 Rajput Mahasabha president Satinder Singh Chouhan said the company, which has bagged the contract to build the flyover, approached them with a request to shift the icon’s statue.
 
 “Accordingly, we requested Huda to provide us land at Leisure Valley Park for shifting the statue. We wanted the statue to be installed at the gate of the park and Huda has agreed to it,” said Chouhan after a meeting with Huda officials on Wednesday.
