GURUGRAM: A 20-year-old man was   on Monday for allegedly   a five-year-old girl near Pathredi village in   area. 

 The girl’s father, who works as a painter to earn his livelihood, told cops that the accused — Ramsar Jeevan — was their   and used to often spend time with the girl near their house. “At 5.30pm on Sunday, our daughter had stepped out of the house to play. Jeevan joined her after a few minutes. This wasn’t the first time that the youth came to play with our girl so we didn’t suspect him. After a while, my wife noticed that Jeevan and our daughter were not outside the house. She assumed that they had gone nearby. Soon she heard our daughter screaming and rushed out of the house. She saw Jeeven at a secluded spot forcing himself on our daughter. As my wife raised an alarm Jeeven fled the spot,” the girl’s father told cops. 
 
 After reaching home, the woman informed her husband and then approached cops at   police station. An FIR was registered against Jeeven under the POCSO Act and the girl was sent for a medical examination that confirmed sexual assault. 
 
 “We have arrested the accused and will produce him in court on Tuesday,” said Poonam Singh, SHO of Manesar woman police station. 
 
 This is not the first time that a child has been lured by someone known and raped or sexually assaulted in the city. Divya Vaishnava, director of BUD foundation — an NGO— said conducting personal safety lessons for children across the city is the need of the hour. “In most cases, the abuser is known to the child. The key to check sexual abuse cases against children is to spread awareness through campaigns,” Vaishnava said.
