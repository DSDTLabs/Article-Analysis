NAGPUR: While the local captains of industry are not going gaga over the 2017-18 union budget, they think it will have a positive effect on the whole. 

 Pravin Tapadia, former president of Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA), said that the budget was by and large a good one. “The government has given relief to SMEs by reducing corporate tax by 5%. Big industries would have appreciated if there was some reduction in corporate tax. A good aspect is that public investment has been increased by 25%   has also been maintained. Moreover, the budget is not very populist,” he added.
 
 Madhusudan Rungta, president of Chandrapur MIDC Industries Association, said that the budget was quite good for SMEs. “The income tax for companies having turnover less than Rs50 crore has been reduced to 25% from 30%. The audit limit has been increase from Rs1 crore to Rs2 crore. Income Tax has also been reduced. Mudra loan and stand up loans tickets have been increased,” he said.
 
 Chandramohan Randhir, MIDC (Hingna) Industries Association (MIA) president, said, “Increase amount of spending on defence, social, etc will help the economy and hence the industry by increasing demand” he added.
 
 Randhir added that some measure of relief should have to those earning higher.
 
 Nitin Lonkar, president of Butibori Manufacturers Association (BMA), said, “It can’t be termed be as an industry specific budget but it has taken care of all sectors,” he said. 
 
 The decision to reduce tax for small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) is a welcome one. The incentives given under Stand Up India scheme will hopefully kick-start new industries. The unprecedented investment in infrastructure — Rs3.96 lakh crore — will hopefully give a big boost to industry and manufacturing’s share in gross domestic product (GDP) will go up significantly,” he said.
