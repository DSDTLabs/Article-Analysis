GHAZIABAD: A youth presumed to be in his early 20s was killed when the car in which he was travelling crashed into an SUV in   in the wee hours of Sunday. The police suspect the occupants of the car, a white Skoda Rapid, could have been drunk and were speeding. The occupants of both the vehicles fled the spot at the   crossing leaving the cars behind.

 The deceased was later identified in the afternoon as  , a resident of Arthala in Mohan Nagar. The police said Atif, who was seated in the rear of the car, was travelling to Aligarh along with his cousins Inaam and Haider to attend a wedding. Atif’s father, Mohammed Haroon, is a sub-inspector of UP police posted in Kanpur.
 
 Haroon was not available for comments despite repeated calls. The SUV, a black Scorpio, had a BJP sticker and a party flag in the front.
 
 “The deceased’s family members have told the police that he was in the habit of drinking along with his friends. So, we are not ruling out drunk driving. It is not clear which vehicle was at fault. We have traced the primary owners of both vehicles. It cannot be concluded that the SUV belonged to any BJP leader because such stickers are used freely,” Kavi Nagar circle officer Atish Kumar Singh said.
 
 Eyewitnesses have told the police that both the vehicles had been speeding on the stretch. Gaurav Sharma, who runs a website designing firm in Shastri Nagar, was among those who rushed Atif to the hospital, where he was declared brought dead.
 
 Police were yet to register any case till late in the evening. An autopsy was conducted and its report awaited.
