CHENNAI: Caretaker chief minister   on Thursday sought to assert his authority with the bureaucracy, exploring the option of transferring Chennai police commissioner S George at a joint meeting of chief secretary Girija Vaidyanathan and DGP  .

 Sources said the CM was upset with the way the CoP handled the situation when the   faction bundled MLAs into buses on Wednesday to be driven to a resort outside the city. He sought a replacement for George and zeroed in on ADGP, police administration, Sanjay Arora . However, no official order was released either by the chief secretary or the home secretary.The sources said the chief secretary might seek the governor’s nod before issuing the order. 
 
 The officials recommended three names of IPS officers – J K Tripathy, Karan Sinha and Sanjay Arora – to Paneerselvam. Tripathy is the additional director general of police, state law and order, and Sinha is the head of the CBCID wing.
 
 TOI on Thursday reported that senior police officers were in a quandary as to who to look forward to for orders because of the uncertainty in the tug-of-war between Paneerselvam and   general secretary V K Sasikala. 
 
 Soon after Paneerselvam’s resignation as chief minister to pave way for the swearing in of Sasikala, police officers have been meeting Sasikala at her residence hoping that she is going to be the next chief minister. But the dynamics changed after Paneerselvam raised a flag of revolt.
