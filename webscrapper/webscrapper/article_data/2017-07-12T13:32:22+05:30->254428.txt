NAGPUR: Former civil supplies minister and NCP leader   has alleged that the BJP-led government in the state has resorted to massive cut in   to   card holders availing benefit of public distribution system. 

 “After denying help to farmers reeling in distress for last three years, now the government is depriving the sweetener to 70% of the poor and needy under PDS,” Deshmukh said in a release. Except the Antyodaya, all other card holders are not getting sugar through ration shops. Even the Antyodaya ones get only one kg per month,” the ex-minister alleged.
 
 “The Devendra Fadnavis government has once again demonstrated its anti-poor approach. In fact soon after coming to power it has started reducing supplies through PDS and the orange cards were withdrawn. How will the poor and needy survive without essential supplies which they cannot afford to buy in open market,” asked Deshmukh. “Thousands of people who used to get the grains and sugar at Rs13.50 a kg have thus been deprived of the facility,” he added.
 
 In Nagpur district alone the sugar supply has been cut from 3,135 quintals a month to just 693 quintals. A similar cut has been effected in every other district,” Deshmukh alleged. “The BJP government on the one hand favours industrialists but on the other deprives those living below poverty line the basic food items through the public distribution system,” Deshmukh stressed.
