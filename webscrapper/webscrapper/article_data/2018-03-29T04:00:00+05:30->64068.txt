Ahmedabad: The Comptroller and Auditor General of India in its report stated that despite the recommendation to insulate power cables to prevent electrocution of birds, the absence of such insulation is threatening the lives of flamingoes and other birds that fly through Little Rann of Kutch.

 The CAG noted that for evacuation of power from ultra-mega power projects (UMPP) at Mundra and further transmission to the end users, high voltage transmission lines were laid by APL, GETCO and PGCIL. The transmission lines of UMPP had to cross LRK-the nesting ground of the lesser and greater flamingoes. These birds were prone to collision with transmission lines and electrocution. 
 
 The MoEF&CC had in 2014 recommended insulated conductors to prevent electrocution of birds. The sanctions for laying of transmission lines across LRK were granted subject to the condition of installing reflectors or use of insulated cables.
 
 The audit observed that there was no system to monitor compliance of conditions laid down in the sanction for laying transmission lines by the user agencies. In the absence of monitoring mechanism, installation of reflectors, perch detector and insulated conductors could not be ensured. 
 
 Further ,CAG also pulled up the forest department for permitting the Adani Power Limited for laying power transmission lines without any prior permission. The CAG stated that APL had commissioned the line in July 2009 according to the order of the Central Electricity Commission and PCCF wildlife in September 2010, that is around 13 months after commissioning of the transmission line in July 2009.
