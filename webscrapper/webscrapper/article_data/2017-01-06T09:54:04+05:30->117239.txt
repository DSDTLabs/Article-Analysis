CHANDIGRAH: Ending the uncertainty,   of All India   (TMC)   released the first list of five candidates to be fielded by the party. Those named include: Former minister Harbans Lal from Fatehgarh Sahib, Begum Parveen Nusrat from Malerkotla, former MLA Vijay Sathi from Moga, Prof Manpreet Kaur Brar Rajeana from Bagha Purana, and Giriraj Rajora from Balluana (SC). 

 While Brar did not answer how many seats TMC would contest in Punjab, he said, "We made repeated appeals for joint candidates where the movement was weak but now there is no further reason to hold back much stronger overlooked candidates and in the coming days we will announce more names."
 
 Party sources have confirmed that a team of central election observers from TMC has been appointed under the supervision of TMC's national vice-president & Rajya Sabha MP Mukul Roy. Party supremo Mamata Banerjee will campaign for TMC candidates in   in the coming days. After AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal "backed out" of the pre-poll alliance talks with the TMC, Brar termed the development as "an immature self-goal".
