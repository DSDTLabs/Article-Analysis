VIJAYAWADA: Criticising the Union government, and the provisions in 15th Finance Commission, for using 2011census data to allocate funds and resources,   finance minister TM Thomas   said the move imposes conditions and limits fiscal powers of all states.

 The terms of reference (TOR) provisions are, in a manner, to impose conditions and limit fiscal powers and tax devolution of all states, he said.
 
 Talking to TOI on Monday during his visit to   to meet AP finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, Isaac said the southern states alone will suffer a loss of Rs 80,000 crore because of the commission’s recommendations. He hoped that  , which did not attend the first conclave of finance ministers from southern states in Thiruvananthapuram, participates in the second edition which will be held in Amaravati on May 7. He said the discussion will be at a broader level, where federal aspects in the TOR will be discussed.
 
 The minister said that the Telangana government had decided not to participate in the first conclave as it wanted the agenda of discussion to be ‘state versus the Centre’, and not ‘southern states versus central government’. “We also don’t have objections to this, hope this time they will join the conclave.”
 
 Isaac was in the city to discuss the agenda for second edition of the FM’s conclave. The minister said that the TOR also argues that there is need to reduce share of states in tax devolution. Even if the share of states in devolution is decreased to one per cent, it will have a huge impact on the particular state’s economy.
 
 Expressing concern over some references, which concern all states, he said, “The wording of TOR of the commission gives an impression that the 14th commission had given too much to the states. There is a clause, which asks the finance commission to stop compensating the revenue deficit of the states.”
