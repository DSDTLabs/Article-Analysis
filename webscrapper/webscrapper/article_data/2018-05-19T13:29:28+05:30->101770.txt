BHOPAL: Among the foreign and Indian tourists visiting the state capital,   and   (RMNH) have been the most sought-after with a steady increase in footfall at the two museums over the years.

 
 RMNH registered a rise in number of visitors from 67,536 in 2016-17 (April to March) to 72,935 in the financial year 2017-18 while Tribal Museum with its state-of-the-art gallery and unique planning and architecture rose to become the most loved museum in Bhopal with 2,14,522 people visiting it in 2017 and 59,596 in the first five months of 2018. Museum curator   attributed the success to simple-yet-beautiful tribal art forms that the museum tries to preserve and popularize. “The museum is becoming popular as it represents many forms of simple, elegant and beautiful tribal art forms. The simplicity of tribal paintings, craft and decorations has made the people relate to them and replicate them in their own houses and art forms. The expression of tribal art is simple and understandable with no complications. This is what appeals to the visitors,” said Mishra.
 
 With online promotions and engaging citizens on social media platforms, the museums are leaving no stone unturned to connect with the people.
 
 Senior scientist at RMNH Manoj Sharma said, “We try to keep on conducting activities for citizens, especially the children, to help them learn and have a good time at the museum. With good response from the visitors, we always try to give them the best of facilities.”
 
 While footfall of tourists increased for the two museums, the   (IGRMS) registered a fall in the number of tourists. Once a top destination for art and culture lovers, IGRMS has not been able to attract visitors in 2017-18 with only 1,87,180 people visiting it. Over 2 lakh people had visited IGRMS in 2015-16 and 2016-17.
 
 Explaining the reason behind falling numbers, IGRMS PRO   told TOI that the number of visitors went down because of the rise in ticket price from Rs 20 to Rs 50 per head in 2018. “It’s been seen that the footfall went down after rise in ticket prices. Still, we are having a good footfall. Anthropology students and research scholars are coming to the museum in large numbers,” said Sharma.
