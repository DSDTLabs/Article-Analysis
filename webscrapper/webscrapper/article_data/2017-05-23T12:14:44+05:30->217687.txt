MYSURU: R  , 19, a  ,   at   here on Monday. 

 Rakshitha had attempted suicide by setting herself ablaze near KSRTC bus stand in   on May 18. She took the extreme step after being humiliated by the parents of her lover Srinivas, a KSRTC driver, whom she had married secretly four months ago. Her father Ramegowda was also assaulted by them the same day. 
 
 When her father went to complain against Srinivas at KSRTC bus depot in Chamarajanagar, Rakshitha collected petrol in a bottle from a nearby petrol station and attempted suicide at the bus stand. 
 
 Srinivas allegedly abandoned Rakshitha a few weeks after they tied the knot at MM Hill without informing their parents. Rakshitha, V semester computer science student of Government Engineering College in Chamarajanagar, used to regularly travel in the bus from Mysuru to the border district. It was then that she befriended Srinivas. Their friendship turned into love, after which they got married at a temple.
 
 Police have arrested Srinivas and a search is on for his parents.
