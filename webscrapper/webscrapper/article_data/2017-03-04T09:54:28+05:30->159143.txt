LUCKNOW: BSP chief   on Friday played the Most Backward Caste card ahead of sixth phase polling and accused the BJP of ending the rule of VP Singh government that implemented the   report envisaging reservation for the other backward class. 

 Addressing a rally in Mirzapur, BSP chief accused the BJP of being against MBC, which constitute a significant portion of OBCs. Mayawati said her party had given the support to the then VP Singh government on a condition that it would implement the Mandal commission report.
 
 She said when Singh implemented the commission report it was not liked by the BJP. 
 
 At another rally in Jaunpur, she termed Prime Minister  's statement that there was a 'strong undercurrent' in favour of BJP as 'din mein tare dekhne ke samaan' (daydreaming) and claimed people who faced hardships after 'note bandi' had made up their mind to teach BJP a lesson.
 
 "These days, the PM is indulging in imaginary talks that even his party men could not believe. The people have already made up their mind to go with BSP," she said at an election rally in Jaunpur.
