CHANDIGARH: Former Union minister and local MP   has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and sought direct connectivity of the city to the new   at Mohali through an underpass below the runway from the road connecting National Highway 21 to the recently-built but now closed Airport Terminal at Chandigarh.

 In his letter   said that new-terminal building at Chandigarh was completed with a cost of Rs 78 crore and put to operation in April, 2011, after demolition of the old building, which had existed ever since the civil enclave of the Indian Air Force Station was opened in 1970s.
 
 “After the commissioning of the new international terminal at Mohali in 2015, all services from the newly-constructed domestic terminal at Chandigarh (constructed at a cost of over Rs. 78 crore) have been discontinued and shifted to the terminal in Mohali. At of now, the terminal in Chandigarh is lying completely shut, thus putting to waste enormous government funds. Concomitantly, the shifting of all the operations, domestic and international, to Mohali side has resulted in depriving Chandigarh UT (and Panchkula) of an easy access to the new terminal. Instead, and a long, circuitous route has to be followed through a major part of Mohali,” he wrote.
 
 “Since the two terminals at Chandigarh and Mohali have a common runway that lies in Chandigarh territory, there is a genuine feeling amongst the people of Chandigarh that they should have an easy, direct access to the new terminal. Provision of such a facility at Chandigarh will save a lot of time of residents in approaching the Terminal on Mohali side,” he further stated.
