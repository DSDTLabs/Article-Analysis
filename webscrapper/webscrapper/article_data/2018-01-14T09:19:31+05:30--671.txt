THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: "We will now hear from a member, whose presence in this assembly is significant," said speaker   during the final sessions of   (LKS) on Saturday. His dramatic remark was sufficient to catch the attention of the entire assembly when he introduced Najeeb, who inspired the lead character of author  's book Aadujeevitham (Goat Days). 

 His was the shortest speech at the two-day proceedings. But, it was the most-powerful one too as the audience broke into a huge applause. "The opportunity given to somebody like me to be a member of this assembly has provided great relief to thousands of destitute NRKs (non-resident Keralites). This has raised their hopes," he said.
 
 Najeeb wasn't alone in representing people who were destined to survive difficult situations during their life in faraway lands. There was Merin Jose, the nurse who escaped from the clutches of terrorists in   and inspired the   film Take Off.
 
 In her address, she described the difficulties faced by nurses at their workplaces abroad. "Officials with Indian Embassy in each country should find time, at least once in six months, to understand the problems faced by nurses," she said.
 
 Governor  , during his inaugural address at the concluding ceremony held later, did not forget to mention the presence of Najeeb at LKS. "I am informed that Najeeb, the main character in Benyamin's novel, was present at LKS. I am certain that it must have conveyed a message on the hardships faced by our people who are often cheated by recruiters and other agencies, when they aspire to go abroad and work. Such instances occur despite the best efforts of government agencies to ensure transparency in recruitment," he added.
