KOLKATA: Heavy showers on   and again on Wednesday, coupled with the Met prediction that it may rain during Durga Puja, have left Puja committees,   officials and Kolkata Police worried. The government agencies have now returned to the drawing board to chart out plans for a hassle-free and safe festive season.

 Sources privy to the development said the authorities are especially worried about four major pockets — Ultadanga, Central Avenue, Behala and Bhowanipore — that are home to some of the most popular pandals.
 
 According to a civic official, KMC is trying to keep all arrangements ready to ensure that water doesn’t stagnate in and around the pandals. The traffic guards have been asked to keep diver-sion plans ready in case of heavy rainfall and subsequ-ent waterlogging.
 
 “We have gone back to the specifics to chalk out a plan. For example, if there is waterlogging near Ultadanga underpass, a KMC team will be present to pump it out. There are two traffic regulation plans in place, but smaller vehicles will be regulated from Manicktala and Khanna. 
 
 “Similarly, if required, James Long Sarani will have to take greater load if DH Road chokes up. For Behala areas, KMC will keep a drainage department team ready with porable pumps to flush out storm water. Our teams will collect hourly ground report that will reach KMC and police headquarters so that the brass can take quick decisions. We will be also employing strategic crowd management systems at important crossings if we see a surge,” said a senior IPS officer at Lalbazar.
 
 A KMC drainage department official added that elaborate arrangements will be in place both at the ward level and at drainage pumping stations on festive days.
