Rajkot: Happy Pachani, a class 8th student of city-based PB Kotak School, emerged winner of Classmate Spell Bee Season 9’s online semi-finals conducted for Rajkot this week.  Pachani will now be in the contention to compete in the national finals of the competition. The competition this year is powered by The Times of India and Times NIE is the education partner. In the initial phase, an on-ground exercise was conducted across 15 schools in Rajkot where children were given spelling tests. Top 15 scorers from each school then competed in the city finals round. Top performers from the finals then competed in the semi-final stage of the competition.  “We are extremely pleased with Happy’s achievement and performance. She has always been competitive and herself decides on taking part in various such competitions,” said Ajay Pachani, her father, who works with a private firm in the city. A city winner does not automatically qualify for the national finals. Only 16 students with the top 16 scores across India will qualify purely on the score merit. The culmination of Classmate Spell Bee Season 9 will see a gruelling competition between the top 16 scorers of India to win the title of Classmate Spell Bee Season 9’s national champion. Rajkot is one of the 30 cities in which such semi-finals were conducted.  The national champion will win a prize of Rs 2 lakh besides an opportunity to witness the prestigious Scripps National Spelling Bee with a parent in Washington DC USA in an all-expense paid trip. The four semi-finalists will win a cash prize of Rs 50,000 each.
