PATNA: The   on Monday criticised CM   for not arresting   minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey’s son Arijit Shashwat despite a warrant of arrest pending against him in connection with the communal clashes at   in Bhagalpur on March 17.

 RJD legislators held a demonstration outside the state legislature in protest against the police’s failure to arrest Shashwat and also demanded resignation of the CM.
 
 Leader of opposition in the assembly   Prasad Yadav alleged Shashwat was freely moving on the Patna streets on Sunday evening. “Though an arrest warrant was issued against him on Saturday, Shashwat participated in a Ram Navami procession brandishing a sword in Patna and also live-streamed the procession on the Facebook,” the RJD leader told reporters. 
 
 “Where is the rule of law and the law of land, Mr CM? He is wanted in a case of inciting riots. Such a shame for Nitish government,” Tejashwi later tweeted.
 
 In another tweet, he said, “Nitish Kumar should answer how is he (Shashwat) roaming free if there is a warrant issued against him. He (CM) has lost control over the govt. It is being run from Nagpur. This shows how weak he has become.”
 
 The wrrants of arrest have been issued by Bhagalpur’s additional CJM Anjani Kumar Srivastava against Shashwat and eight others on an application filed by the Nathnagar police. The eight others are Abhay Kumar Ghosh, Sonu, Pramod Verma Pammy, Dev Kumar Pandey, Sanjay Bhatt, Surendra Pathak, Amit Lal Sah and Pranav Sah alias Pranav Das, who are co-accused with Shashwat in an FIR lodged by police for fomenting communal tension at Nathnagar.
