LUCKNOW: In a meeting held at   on Thursday, meat sellers, exporters and suppliers from across the state decided to hold a protest march on April 20, demanding issuance and renewal of licences. A meeting of all the state delegates of All India   (AIJQA) has been called in Barielly on May 10 to decide on nationwide strike if demands are not met by then. 

 AIJQA, UP, president Mohd Yusuf Qureshi said, "The chief minister promised us that   will issue and renew licences to those who are following all norms, but no action has been taken so far." The meat sellers are on strike for the past 13 days protesting crackdown on unlicensed slaughterhouses and meat shops. 
 
 AIJQA national president Sirajuddin Qureshi appealed to all the members to establish and support cow shelters in their districts because cow is the symbol of peace and love between two religions. Qureshi also lauded the members for not reacting to police high-handedness and provocative sloganeering in parts of the state.
