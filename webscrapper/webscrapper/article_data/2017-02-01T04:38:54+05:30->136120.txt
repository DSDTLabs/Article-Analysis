GURUGRAM:   remained ‘very poor’ on Tuesday as dense fog engulfed large parts of the city in the morning. However, the minimum temperature on Tuesday was recorded at 10 degrees Celsius, a mild increase from Monday’s eight degrees Celsius. 

 The   office has said that fog will persist through the week and predicted   during the weekend owing to fresh western disturbance, which will bring the temperature down by two to three degrees.
 
 Haryana Pollution Control Board (HPCB) data suggested that the concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 on Tuesday was at a level that was four times higher than what is prescribed as safe by World Health Organisation ( ).

 “Fuel exhaust from vehicles and smoke from generators have shot up the pollution levels. Gurgaon’s proximity to NH-8 where thousands of vehicles zoom past the city every day contribute to the rising levels of bad air,” an official from HSPCB told TOI.
 
 Meanwhile, the Met department said the National Capital Region is likely to witness a fresh spell of rain over the weekend, which might send the temperatures plummeting in Gurgaon. “In the morning, there will be shallow fog in the coming days. At isolated places, the fog might get denser,” said Devendra Pradhan, senior scientist at Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). “Light showers are expected on Sunday,” he added.
