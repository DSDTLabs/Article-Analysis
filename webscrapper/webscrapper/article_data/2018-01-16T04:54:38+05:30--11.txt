NEW DELHI: Slamming the capital’s civic authorities for their failure to take action against  , the   on Monday said they had failed to discharge their duties leading to complete breakdown of law and sought explanation on why illegal construction was allowed over the years.

 A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta directed MCD, NDMC, DDA and Land and Development Office (L&DO) to file their response after senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, assisting the court as amicus curiae, contended that the authorities had taken no action to stop illegal construction after 2012 when the apex court had stayed the sealing drive conducted by its monitoring committee.
 
 The court passed the order after perusing the report filed by the monitoring committee highlighting that officials of civic authorities were hand in glove with builders to allow them to build illegal structures in violation of laws for extraneous considerations and no action was taken. 
 
 The committee, comprising former advisor to Election Commission K J Rao, Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) chairman Bhure Lal and Major General Som Jhingan, was entrusted the task of carrying out sealing drive against illegal constructions in 2006 during which thousands of premises were sealed. The sealing drive went on till January, 2012 when the court asked the panel not to proceed further as the government had brought in force 2021 Master Plan for regularising some of the illegal constructions. But the committee was asked to keep filing reports on the status of unauthorised constructions in the city.
 
 “The committee during its period of existence was successful in creating a climate of acceptance of the laid down regulations in terms of Master Plan, building by-laws and other enactments with respect to land use, construction activities and general functioning. With the embargo imposed on sealing, the fear factor has completely evaporated and all the agencies namely MCD, NDMC,DDA, L&DO are back to their dubious practices and are hand in glove with the greedy citizens,” the report said.
 
 The bench said the court, while staying the sealing drive, had not restrained the civic authorities from taking action against builders for illegal construction and they failed to carry out their statutory duties.
