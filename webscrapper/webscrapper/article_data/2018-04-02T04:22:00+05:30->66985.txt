Vadodara: The Vadodara Innovation Council (VIC) will give a major push to the ‘Tod-Fod-Jod’ initiative through which students gain knowledge out of experience rather than text books. 

 VIC has decided to conduct nearly 300 sessions of ‘Tod-Fod-Jod’ in 15 schools in the next academic year. 
 
 The initiative was first launched by the National Innovation Council through which kids used to get opportunity to de-construct everyday products and learn real life applications. 
 
 In 2012, VIC had launched its first batch of Tod-Fod-Jod in the city. The programme helps students to figure out how products are designed, how they work, connecting multi-disciplinary concepts that they otherwise learn from textbooks. During the sessions, the kids re-construct or repair them or re-purpose them to create something new.
 
 “Earlier, our efforts were that schools should set up ‘Tod-Fod-Jod’ labs at their premises. But schools found difficulties in setting up such labs. Hence, we have decided that VIC itself will run the sessions at the schools and provide gadgets, facilitators and other required tools,” said Dr Madhu Mehta from VIC. 
 
 Sunday witnessed a pre-launch of the project at Baroda High School, Alkapuri where a select group was invited to share thoughts and plans to give the initiative a big push. 
 
 “We will be launching the project on April 15,” said Mehta, adding that at each of the participating schools, a group of 50 students can be taught functioning of ten products including day to day gadgets be it bicycles, water purifiers, pressure cookers or sewing machines. 
 
 “While the students will open the gadgets, understand their functioning and learn how the products got evolved, a facilitator will remain present at each of this session to answer their queries,” he said.
