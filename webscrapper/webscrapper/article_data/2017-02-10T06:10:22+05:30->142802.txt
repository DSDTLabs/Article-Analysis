KOCHI: The high court has declined to accept out-of-court settlement in a case where a 45-year-old monk, who was the warden of the boys' hostel of a school run by the  , is accused of sexually assaulting a minor boy. The court said it was a serious case and any settlement between the accused and the guardian cannot be given approval by the court.

 The single bench order came while considering a petition filed by  , now residing at Ra makrishna Mission Vidyalaya in Coimbatore. The alleged acts of aggravated sexual assault on the Class V student took place in 2014 while the monk was working at   at Puranattukara in Thrissur. The case was registered by Peramangalam police on a complaint filed by the child's grandmother. The case is now pending trial before a Thrissur court. Seeking to quash the case, the monk had produced affidavits given by three students and the grandmother allegedly agreeing to an out-ofcourt settlement. The monk contended that the allegations were falsely foisted. Senior students of the school were behind the complaint as they were aggrieved as he was a strict disciplinarian.An internal inquiry conducted by the mission had exculpated him, he argued.
 
 The public prosecutor opposed the plea on the ground that the allegations were extremely serious and the act allegedly committed by the petitioner cannot be condoned by no stretch of imagination.
 
 The court said in the judgment, “The allegations raised are serious and a minor child is involved. By no stretch of imagination can it be held to be an offence as between the private parties simplicitor. Offence of this nature will have a serious impact on the society at large and any settlement... cannot be given the imprimatur (approval) of this court.“ The court then ordered for an expedited trial.
