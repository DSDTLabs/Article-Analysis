Think of a   and the name’s Bond, James Bond. But MI6 instead wants mothers for their emotional intelligence, not a martini-swilling, guntoting womanizer in a tux.

 The UK’s overseas secret intelligence service is on a recruitment drive aimed at women with kids and black and minority ethnic candidates. Why? Because the changing nature of the security threat calls for a more diverse workforce with different skills.
 
 “We want, oxymoronically, people who never thought of joining MI6 — to join MI6,” the agency’s chief   said at the launch of a new advertising campaign. “We want different points of view when making the crunchy decisions.”
 
 The advertisement plays on the public’s imagination of what a spy should look like. Footage shows menacing sharks circling their prey before the camera pans out to reveal a mom at an aquarium able to anticipate danger. It concludes: “Secretly, we’re just like you.” The agency offers flexible work patterns to suit parents, as it seeks to recruit 800 more staff by 2021.
