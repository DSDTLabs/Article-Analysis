THANE: The fake call centre mastermind, Sagar Thakar aka   (24), left the law-enforcement officials baffled after he told a magistrate that he wants to be remanded in a police lock-up. 

 On Thursday, Shaggy was produced before magistrate AB Katte after his police custody ended on Thursday. 
 
 Investigation officer Mukund Hatote told the court that they had taken Shaggy to Ahmedabad. " Some of his accounts, which may be linked to the crime, need to be checked. Hence, we require his custody for seven more days," Hatote told the court. 
 
 Katte asked Shaggy if he had any complaints against the police, after which the accused said he wanted to be in police custody and cooperate with the investigators and reveal the details of the modus operandi of fake call centres. The lawyers present in the court were stunned to hear his reply. "Shaggy reportedly fears going to prison and live among hardened criminals," said a police source. After hearing both sides, the magistrate extended Shaggy's police custody till April 17.
 
 Police said that they have not got anything substantial from their visit to Ahmedabad with Shaggy. "All the accused showed us is his residential apartments and the office blocks he purchased," said a police officer. The mastermind of the   and Ahmedabad fake call centres that conned hundreds of US citizens of millions of dollars was arrested by the Thane police following his deportation from Dubai late on Friday. He was on the run soon after the Thane crime branch raided nine call centres at Mira Road on October 4, 2016.
 
 On the other hand, investigators claimed that they have zeroed on 10 complainants from US whose voice samples as well as trail of the call made from Mira road fake call centres and the one who extracted money is traced.
