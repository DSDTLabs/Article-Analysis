KOCHI:   at   ( ) came to a halt for around 50 minutes after a   flight from Colombo landed a metre away from its designated path due to strong crosswinds and heavy rain on Sunday afternoon.

 
 There were 248 passengers onboard the flight. Scheduled to arrive at Cial from Colombo at 3.20 am, it slightly deviated during the last lap of its landing due to   and low visibility causing the rear side left wheel of the aircraft to hit the edge of the runway at 3.55 pm. The incident also led to Jet Airways flight from Mumbai being diverted to Coimbatore. The airport had resumed operations in 50 minutes.
 
 Mishap was avoided after the pilot skilfully handled the deviation and turned the flight into the runway, thereby safely parking the flight. Airport officials informed that none of the passengers or crew members onboard suffered any injury due to the incident.
 
 “Once the incident had taken place, the runway had to be cleaned for further operations. There were no damages caused on the runway or the aircraft because of the incident. The tyres of the aircrafts were covered in sludge, which required cleaning to get it back to normal,” said Chandrakumaran Nair A, Cial’s airport director. Cial is waiting for final approval to operationalize their instrument landing system on the western end of the runway. This will allow pilots to land the aircraft during low visibility and high winds on western end of the runway, thereby considerably reducing the chances for similar mishaps or flight diversions.
 
 “In this case, nothing else was possible but to go ahead with landing as the pilot had already entered the final lap of the landing. Once the flight has entered the final lap of the landing during heavy wind and rain, there will be a slight shift in the landing position. The pilot had handled the situation well in this case,” added Nair.
