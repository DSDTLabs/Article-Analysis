Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday stayed the public works department notification dated March 20 inviting tender to carry out various works in Pudukottai district under a package system clubbing various works at a cost of Rs 17.8 crore. Justice M S Ramesh who heard the case filed by contractor P Muthukumar from Pudukottai against the tender issued by the superintending engineer (buildings), Trichy, adjourned the case to June 5.

 Petitioner’s counsel Ganapathi Subramanian told the court that the PWD had on various occasions called for tenders to carry out seven works separately. The works included construction of ten classrooms, science laboratory, boys toilet and stadium work. All on a sudden, it cancelled all the tender notifications and issued a fresh one clubbing all the works at a cost of Rs 17.8 crore. Also, a contractor who had completed works for Rs 8.9 crore last year alone was eligible to participate in the tender process. The PWD’s action had enabled around 20 contractors to participate in the tender process but deprived many like the petitioner in Pudukottai district an opportunity to take part in it. 
 
 Besides, the PWD had said the tender schedule would be available from March 22 to 24 on the government website but it failed to upload the same. Further, it had also not followed the central vigilance commission’s guidelines insisting on e-tender/e- procurement so as to bring about transparency. The PWD’s action smacked of favouritism so as to benefit people of its choice, he said. tnn
