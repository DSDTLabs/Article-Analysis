GUWAHATI: The All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) has sought President  's intervention to stop   in the name of eviction in the state. 

 An AIUDF delegation, led by party chief  , met the President in New Delhi on Tuesday on the issue of state government's recent eviction drives on its encroached lands.
 
 The delegation highlighted that the evictions were carried out targeting people of a particular community in an 'arbitrary' manner without providing rehabilitation packages. Ajmal said people actually settled on government land after they were displaced by floods and erosion.
 
 "It has been observed that since the eviction in fringe villages of Kaziranga in September last year, several such drives were carried out in places like Sipajhar, Mayang, Fuhuratali, Chandardinga and Hajo. A particular community was targeted and the eviction was done by ggiving a short notice to them," he alleged. 
 
 The AIUDF delegation has sought the President's intervention to instruct the central and state governments to formulate a comprehensive policy on eviction and settlement.
 
 Asserting that 23% of government land is under encroachment, the AIUDF delegation said there should be no discrimination on the basis of religion, caste and creed while carrying out eviction drives.
 
 AIUDF demanded land rights for people who settled on government lands after being displced in floods and erosion.
