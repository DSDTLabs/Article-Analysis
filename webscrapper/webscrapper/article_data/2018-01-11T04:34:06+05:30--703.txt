BHOPAL: Three years after taking over the investigation of the  , the CBI has found no credible evidence to substantiate allegations against former   chief minister Uma Bharati, say sources.

 Initially, investigators had divided opinions on the matter, but superiors intervened and cleared their “confusion”, said an official privy to the information.
 
 It was Uma Bharati who had reiterated in 2014 that the Vyapam scam was bigger than the fodder scam and pressed for a CBI probe. The same year, the state   charged her with involvement in the scam. She reacted strongly, accusing the opposition of misleading people since its leaders were involved.
