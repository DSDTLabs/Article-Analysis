Mangaluru: Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) commissioner   has warned underground drainage maintenance (UGD) contractors, who allegedly let sewage towards the   (Phalguni) river. 

 “We have noticed that sewage from houses is being allowed to flow through storm water drains due to lack of UGD system. Such storm water drains flow towards Gurupur river. Those who are responsible for the maintenance of UGD should stop letting sewage flowing into storm water drain. Those who violate the directions will be booked under the KMC Act 1976 for polluting the river water,” the commissioner stated in a release. 
 
 He said that the MCC has received complaints regarding sewage from the septic tanks and leech pits being transported in cesspool tankers and lown towards the river. “Those individuals and owners of the cesspool tankers should immediately stop releasing sewage towards the river. Stern action will be taken against them if they continue to release sewage into the river,” he warned. 
 
 It may be recalled that the TOI had highlighted the issue of Gurupur river pollution due to the inflow effluents from nearby factories. The river in   village near   had witnessed the mass death of fish in May last year. However, the issue was temporarily solved after the onset of monsoon. However, with no rains, the water in the river has turned black again at Malavoor, Sultan Batteri, Hoigebail and other surrounding places. Residents on the river bank also feel stink and saw dead fishes floating on the river.
