Mumbai: A few churches that fall under   may shift Good Friday and   indoors, instead of holding them on school grounds. Police spokesman Ashok Dudhe said it was untrue that permissions were not being granted for outdoor mass. Maundy Thursday falls on April 13, Good Fridayon April 14 and Easter on April 16.

 Holy Name Cathedral in Colaba, where the archbishop presides over holy mass, has been asked to avoid using sound systems. “Most churches use grounds attached to their   for mass. The area around a school is demarcated as silence zone, but schools are closed this time of year. Also, our services wind up before 10pm,” said Fr Nigel Barrett, spokesman for archdiocese. Several churches, whose names were circulated by an NGO, denied not getting permission. —Bella Jaisinghani
