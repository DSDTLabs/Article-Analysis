LUCKNOW: After the   to keep liquor shops 500 metres away from national as well as  , the UP government is all set to make it mandatory to keep them 500 metres away from  ,   and   too. 

 Talking to TOI, excise minister Jai Pratap Singh said that on the lines of SC's order on highways, the state government has decided to keep the liquor shops at a similar distance from hospitals, schools and religious places. "New directives would most likely come into effect from the current fiscal itself. He said that the proposal to bring uniformity in distance could be taken up after a couple of cabinet meetings," he added. 
 
 "Since many liquor shops have flouted norms during the previous regime and prescribed distance from a school, hospital or a religious place has not been adhered to completely, UP government will make it uniform 500 metres," he said.
 
 Meanwhile, following large-scale protests against shifting of liquor shops from highways to locations 500m away in compliance with the SC's order, the government has decided to stop the relocation of around 8,000 such shops till protests subside, the minster told TOI in an exclusive interview.
 
 Speaking about the proposed relocation of liquor shops, the minister said out of the total 8,000 shops, around 5,300 did not face any protest but their business got affected too. So, actual number of shops whose business did not get affected is only between 1,500 and 2,000.
 
 On any decision to change the policy, Singh said a committee was being formed to study policy in different states. Once it gives a report, a new policy would be implemented after March 31, 2018 when the existing liquor policy is no more in effect. 
 
 Singh said state government had no plan to declare   a dry state.
