NEW DELHI: The Bar Council of India on Wednesday decided to examine if  , once elected as  , can continue to remain in legal practice.

 Taking note of a representation it recieved from a lawyer raising the issue, the apex statutory body of advocates issued notice to all elected representatives across the country who continue to practice.
 
 Prominent among those issued notices include former union ministers  ,  , senior lawyers K T S Tulsi, Abhishek Manu Singhvi -all from   and BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Chairman Manan Kumar Mishra said the Council would like to reflect on the views and comments of all the MPs, MLAs and MLCs who are also practicing as lawyers for which a week’s time has been given “The Council has thought it just and proper to seek the comments of those lawmakers who are in legal practice, before taking any final decision in this matter. It is a very important issue which may have far reaching affect,” he explained.
 
 “As per rules, government employees cannot practice as advocates. Does the same logic extend to legislators? We have issued the notice on the basis of the petition filed before the BCI,” Mishra added.
 
 BCI’s notice came on a plea filed by a BJP affiliated lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay. Once it recieved Upadhyay’s representation, the BCI set up a Committee to first examine if it merits attention. In his representation Upadhyay wants to “debar MLAs and MPs from practicing as an advocate before the court of law in spirit of the Bar Council of India rules.”
 
 He argued that such lawmakers appear as advocates even when Parliament or the assemblies are in session and “participate in matters that affects financial interests of country as well as financial interests of their spouse/children/blood relatives/partner/organisation in which they serve.”
