THRISSUR: Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) on Saturday released a document on   practices, detailing cultivation methods that need to be adopted. Vice-chancellor P Rajendran said that though there were 73 agricultural universities in India,   was the first one to prepare such an exclusive package on  

 Agriculture minister   – who released the document at the preparatory meeting of the forthcoming   (OWC) – said that his department would now depend on the document to aid organic farmers. “Kerala will be a partner at the forthcoming event in New Delhi and we will use it as a platform to showcase the state’s progress in organic farming,” he said. OWC coordinator Claude Alvares said the event is held every three years to discuss current issues.
 
 Kerala is aiming to be an organic state and with the release of this KAU document, it will be possible to infuse a standard procedure. The strategy envisages not just the use of organic manure and pesticides, but a complete integration of biodiversity and indigenous farming practices, he added.
 
 Sunilkumar said the state will not patronize ‘fundamentalist concepts’ in the name organic farming as this could lead to a dip in yield. “What we need is a fundamental shift from indiscriminate dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides to scientific farming practice that will ensure high productivity, conserve biodiversity and natural assets. We need indigenous cultivation methods, he said.
 
 The vice-chancellor said organic farming would be sustainable in the state only if it was integrated to waste management. “Earlier, much of the waste would reach homestead farms. Now, people dump waste on roads. This must be reversed,” he said, adding that farmers will have to use organic fertilizers and pesticides.
