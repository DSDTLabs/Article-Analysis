JAIPUR: The   government has issued a notification regarding the   of Maintenance of Internal Security Act ( ) prisoners, declaring them ‘Loktantra Senani’ (Fighters of Democracy).

 MISA prisoners are workers from various political parties who were imprisoned during the Emergency (1975-77). They will now have to be invited for Independence Day and Republic Day functions.
 
 There are about 11,000 ‘Loktantra Senanis’ eligible for this pension, according to officials. They will be given a monthly pension of Rs 12,000 and a medical allowance of Rs 1,200 per month. Those who were imprisoned for at least for a month are eligible for the pension, according to the notification.
 
 At its meeting held on December 12 last year, the state cabinet had decided to amend the Rajasthan’s ‘MISA and DIR Prisoners Pension Rules 2008’.
 
 As per this amendment, natives detained in state jails for political and social reasons during the Emergency would be known as ‘Fighters of Democracy’ and given pension.
 
 Now, native residents of Rajasthan, who were detained in prisons outside the state during the Emergency, will also be given pension and allowances under the rules.
 
 Earlier, only MISA detainees imprisoned in Rajasthan were entitled to pension and allowances.
 
 In case of non-availability of records in jails and police stations, a Loktantra   can apply for pension on the basis of affidavit and certificate of two affiliates, or certified by present or former state legislator or Member of   (MP) of the concerned district.
 
 Earlier, only those who had records of their incarceration were given pension benefits.
 
 The notification, however, says that those MISA prisoners, who are receiving pension from any other state, will not be eligible for the same from Rajasthan.
