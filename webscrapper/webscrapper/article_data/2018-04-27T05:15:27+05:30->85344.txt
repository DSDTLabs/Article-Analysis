MUMBAI:   accused   has sent a notice for amicable, mutual consent divorce to husband and co-accused Peter.

 The two-page notice sent by Speed Post to Peter's present address, Byculla's Arthur Road jail cell, asked him to agree to a mutual consent divorce by complying with the financial settlement already drawn up. The settlement plan would include division of various assets, including properties in Spain and London, and fixed deposits and other investments in domestic and foreign banks. It asked Peter to execute the settlement no later than April 30.
 
 Indrani sent the notice through her advocate Edith Dey. Peter's lawyer Amit Ghag said he was not aware of any such notice being sent or received (a notice is considered served when received).
 
 On Thursday, the accused trio, which also includes Indrani's ex-husband  , appeared before the special   judge for their trial. They sat next to each other, with Indrani in the middle. They didn't speak among themselves.
