NAGPUR: Abdul Majid, 47, president of the coolie association at Nagpur railway station, and his colleagues, ensured that a 30-year-old woman and her two children were rescued from the platform and sent to government shelter home through an NGO. 

 Meena Panhwa, who hails from Barpali in Odisha, had come to the city with her children after her husband   brought another woman home. She was also subjected to torture. Meena finally walked out after Shivprasad tried to throttle their son Chetan during a tiff one day. 
 
 Meena, along with Chetan (6) and daughter Chandi (2 1/2 years), was loitering on platform No. 1 and was moving along quite close to its edge. Chandi was in her arms while Chetan was holding her hand. 
 
 Just before a train was to arrive, a coolie,  , spotted them. Gourkhede alerted his senior colleague Majid who, along with his friend Asfaque Khan, rushed towards the three.
 
 Majid said Meena was on the footover bridge and leaning over the railings when they reached her. “Initially she was not able to speak but broke down soon and narrated her plight,” he said.
 
 “Meena wanted to support her children by working anywhere. We assured her help,” said Majid who offered the woman and her children some food. “She was in a daze and did not seem to have any idea where she was nor where she had come from,” he added.
 
 Majid later took Meena and her children to the camp of NGO Childline on platform No. 1. The childline counsellors immediately alerted the railway security forces who handed her over to the government shelter home.
