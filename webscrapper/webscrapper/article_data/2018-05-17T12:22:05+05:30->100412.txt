PUDUCHERRY: Lieutenant governor   on Wednesday undertook an inspection at the   central prison to review the facilities and initiatives in reforming the prison  . She also reviewed the record management system.

 Bedi, known for launching several reforms at Tihar jail when she served at the high-security prison, guided the Puducherry IG (prisons) Pankaj Kumar Jha on the initiatives to be undertaken to improve prison management. Interacting with the prisoners, she learnt that the most of the violent crimes were out of revenge or nursing a grudge or anger over a period of time. She directed the prison officials to rope in experts to hold ‘anger management’ sessions for the prison inmates to rid their revenge-seeking activities. 
 
 She also directed the officials to impart life skills and sought them to approach the Auroville Foundation to extend spiritual and moral lessons to the experts, who can, in turn, guide the inmates.
