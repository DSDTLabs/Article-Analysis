MUMBAI: The Sena morninger, Saamna, has warned that the latest mob frenzy on the  's verdict on the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act will bring the nation on the brink of disaster. 

 On March 20, the SC introduced a provision of anticipatory bail while also directing that there would be no automatic arrest on any complaint filed under the law.
 
 The Saamna said there was nothing wrong in the SC order that said that the Act should not be misused. "To take to the streets against the SC order goes against the thoughts of Dr B R  ," said the Sena morninger.
 
 Slamming the Centre for filing a review petition seeking an interim stay on SC's March 20 order in the wake of violence, Saamna said such a step would plainly mean cowardice on part of the government. "This would also mean Dr Ambedkar's insult," opined Saamna. The SC verdict of March 20 relating to the SC/ST protection law has triggered widespread unrest with organizations accusing the apex court of having diluted the Act's provisions. On Tuesday, while hearing the Centre's review plea, the SC refused to   of its earlier verdict. "Riots erupt when leadership becomes weak. What is the PM doing," asked Saamna in an editorial on Wednesday.
