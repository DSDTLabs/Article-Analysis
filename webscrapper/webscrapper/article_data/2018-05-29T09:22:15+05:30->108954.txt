CHENNAI: For more than three months, passengers at   have been deprived of a proper food plaza in the new concourse due to delayed approvals by   and Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC). 

 Though the station has a footfall of four lakh passengers per day, users are forced to make do with one   canteen and a few shops that sell food packets. 
 
 More than 50,000 passengers thronged the earlier unit which was closed after the contractor's term ended in February. Passengers who prefer branded food items instead of the food served at railway's subsidised catering stalls are left with few options. This has also led to a huge rush at the railway-run Jan Aahar counter which has not been able to cater to this demand.
 
 It has been a year since the contractor pulled out of a Rs 96 crore deal to set up a major food plaza in the station. After the plan did not take off, passengers were depending on a multi-branch small food plaza. 
 
 The small plaza earlier run by a contractor had a biriyani stall on the first floor and a store selling branded coffee and savouries on the ground floor. To ensure the new ones would be in place before summer, IRCTC floated a tender for the site months in advance and awarded the contract to   (TFSL) last December.
 
 Railway sources said there was a lot of back and forth between TFSL, Chennai division of Southern Railway and IRCTC. The Chennai division wanted some changes in the plan submitted by the contractor citing passenger convenience and footfall.
 
 Divisional railway manager   attributed the delays to the minor changes they had wanted and said they had given approval to revisions. "We have not yet received a final plan from the contractor," he said.
