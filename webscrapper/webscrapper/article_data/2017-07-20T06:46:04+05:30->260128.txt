LUCKNOW: Director general (technical services) of UP   Mahendra Modi on Wednesday conducted what was described as a “routine inspection” of the   at Lucknow.

 The move is significant in the backdrop of the recent security breach at Vidhan Sabha in which a suspicious powder was recovered from the main hall of the assembly on July 12. The lab, in its preliminary findings, had identified the powder as PETN—a highly destructive plastic explosive.
 
 Confirming the inspection, Modi said he spoke to laboratory technicians and staff regarding various issues, and to understand the skill set of staff members.
 
 Sources said during the inspection, senior police officers also tried to find out the procedure that the forensic experts followed while testing the suspicious powder before concluding that it was PETN.
 
 Statements of three staff members who conducted the preliminary test—deputy director Arun Kumar Sharma, scientific officer Narendra Kumar and senior scientific assistant Manoj Kumar—were also recorded by senior officials of the technical service.
 
 According to sources, senior officers also held discussions with laboratory director Shyam Bihari Upadhyay, for almost an hour. Officials also sought an explanation from deputy director, serology, AK Sinha, joint director AK Mittal and scientific officer (chemistry division) Mobeen Khan. While Mittal heads the forensic lab at Agra as joint director, Sinha and Khan are posted at the Lucknow lab.
