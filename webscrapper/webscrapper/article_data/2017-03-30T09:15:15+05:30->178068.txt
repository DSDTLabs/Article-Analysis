NEW  : Brace up for scorching   this weekend and early next week. 

  will occur in many   in the next two to three days. The maximum temperature in the capital and NCR will be around 39 degrees but isolated areas could record more than 40 degrees in the next three-four days.
 
 According to the Regional Meteorological Centre, Delhi heat wave like conditions are prevailing in many parts of Rajasthan, a few places in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and NCR. Parts of west Rajasthan are experiencing severe heat wave conditions. 
 
 The maximum temperature in the capital on Wednesday was 38.2 degrees, about 6 degrees above normal, and the minimum temperature was 23.1 degrees, about 5 degrees above normal. 
 
 Heat wave is mainly attributed to subsidence caused by lower level anti-cyclone over Gujarat and neighbouring areas. This kind of wind pattern and consequent above normal minimum and maximum temperatures are likely to persist for the next few days, a scientist in RMC said. In Delhi NCR the maximum temperatures have been 4 to 6 degrees above normal, the temperature is likely to fall marginally from April 4 or 5, he added.
