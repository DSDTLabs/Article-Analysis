New Delhi: The Crime Branch has unearthed another   paper leak   from Rohini and arrested two members of the gang. The suspects were found to be using a remote software to access the profile of the applicant and solving the papers.

 Police are probing whether this group was a part of the racket busted in north Delhi’s Timarpur on Tuesday. That case was transferred to Crime Branch on Thursday.
 
 The new racket was allegedly running out of a residential house in Rohini. One of the accused has been identified as Amit and his associate Ashok was found in the house with some mobile phones. A laptop too has been seized and is being scanned. Police suspect that the two men could be solvers working for a big gang.
 
 “We have taken over the Timarpur case from the district police and have conducted some enquiries and raids,” said joint commissioner (crime) Alok Kumar.
 
 The cops are looking for Harpal and his associate Anu, the suspected kingpins. Some of the employees of the exam centre in Patparganj and Vivek Vihar are being questioned as well.
 
 It was found that one of accused, Sonu who allegedly has contacts with some of the employees of the SSC at the CGO complex is being interrogated. Cops have contacted the technological service provider, based out of Bangalore, to find out how the papers that were uploaded through their servers were made accessible to the crooks.
 
 On Thursday cops also traced down 10 students who had paid the gang Rs 12-15 lakh each to solve the Combined Higher Secondary Level examination that the men were solving. It was found that the gang has been operating from three houses, apart from the one in Gandhi Vihar. One of them is located near Laxmi Nagar while the other two are in Loni.
