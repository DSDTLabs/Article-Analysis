KOLKATA: Octogenarian  , unlike his son  , used to step out of his home regularly and speak to neighbours till he completely shut himself in three years back, locals said on Friday. When they tried to reach out to the Majumdar household, they were often turned back. 

 "Till a few years back, he did step out of his home regularly. He had a fixed rickshaw puller. He would travel in it to the local market, even to the grocery shop. He would buy milk there. Whenever we met, he would talk normally," said  , a local and elderly himself. All this, however, changed with his wife's death. He not only shut himself in the home. He was rarely seen the first-floor balcony. 
 
 Subhra Mahal, another neighbour, had rushed to the hospital three years back when she came to know that   had passed away. "I had gone to the Balananda hospital. I tried to do whatever little I could. But they refused to speak to us. After a point of time, we didn't make any effort to do it either. The entire neighbourhood felt the same. They never misbehaved but they refused to talk to anyone outside," she recollected. 
 
 Kunal Das, who had gone to the Majumdar home three years back from the local party office, said, "When we heard there was a death in the family, we had gone to their home to verify it and strike the name off the electoral rolls, as is the norm. They first refused to let us in. But the second time, they refused to give the death certificate. We didn't push the matter further but we never went there again."
