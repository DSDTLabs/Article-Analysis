NEW DELHI: The emergent   (EC) of   approved   of the   on Tuesday. However, the members have decided to write to UGC saying they would be unable to comply with the new rule that requires that colleges generate 30% of resources on their own. The EC also decided that they will suggest proposals to takeover colleges such as Hindu, Lady Shri Ram and others managed by trusts, if they are found flouting university rules. 

 EC member AK Bhagi said that implementation of the seventh pay commission “has now made way for the implementation of revised salaries and receiving of funds from funding agencies such as UGC and Delhi government, which was a demand of many teachers.”
 
 The EC resolution also stated that the revised pay scales are applicable to all employees of the university and all constituent colleges. “The EC also noted our concern that the benefits and allowances should be same for DU faculty members and central government employees,” EC member Rajesh Jha added.
 
 However, EC members raised a few concerns in the meeting. Criticising the Office Memorandum (OM) of the ministry of finance, which asks educational institutes to generate 30% of its internal resources on its own, Jha said that “this is an attempt at privatisation that will lead to a steep hike in students’ fees and deprive SC, ST and OBC students of higher education.”
 
 The meeting also saw discussion over the plight of colleges managed by trusts.
