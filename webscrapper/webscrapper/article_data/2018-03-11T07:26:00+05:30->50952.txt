NOIDA: An   has been filed against the   of Bambawad village for allegedly luring 11 couples to remarry for the sake of gifts and cash at a   organised by the   administration last month.

 Three more couples who had gone to the wedding venue have also been held. The families of Sarita and Arun, Seema and Bijender, and Anita and Vishal had claimed that though they had gone to the venue, they had been declared “ineligible” and could not take part in the wedding.
 
 “An FIR has been lodged against Jaswant Singh, the pradhan of the village, under IPC Section 420 (cheating). We have also arrested three of the couples,” said  , the SHO of Badalpur police station.
 
 The villagers pleaded helplessness, saying they had been lured by the panchayat pradhan to participate in the mass wedding for the sake of gifts.
 
 “We are poor people. We got into this problem only because of the pradhan. My mother is old and is feeling insulted. Had we known what we were being made to do was wrong, we would have never done it,” said  , the brother of three sisters Afsana, Rubina and Gulshan who remarried on February 24.
 
 Repeated calls to the pradhan met with the response that it was unreachable.
 
 The chief of another panchayat has been named in the FIR in connection with the mass wedding scam and her husband arrested.
