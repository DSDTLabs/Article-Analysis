SURAT: In an attempt to prevent road mishaps caused by stray cattle on city roads,   (SMC) has decided to   for tying reflector belts along with unique numbers around their necks. 

 Official sources said the civic body had invited tenders from interested agencies for tagging stray cattle in the city. In the first attempt, none of the parties turned up and that the tender was called for the second time. In the second attempt, an agency has shown interest to work for the civic body. 
 
 The tender proposal has been accepted in the   (TSC) and that the same will be sent for final approval before the standing committee.
 
 The tagging of animals will help in identifying the ownership of the cattle, which are let loose on the city roads, thereby creating trouble for commuters and pedestrians.
 
 The belts will have a unique identification number for each and every cattle. The agency persons will visit all ‘tabelas‘ across the city and on the peripheral borders to tag the cattle. 
 
 The stray cattle menace is a major issue here, which had even caused injuries to a large number of people and a few cases were fatal. 
 
 Stray cattle can be found roaming on all roads across the town. The situation was worse on  , Varachha, Katargam, walled city areas, Athwalines, Jehangirpura, Rander, Adajan and Dindoli.
 
 “The tags will identify the cattle let loose on the city roads by their owners. Through the tags, we will be able to identity the ownership of the cattle and accordingly action will be initiated. The stray cattle are a major cause of road accidents, especially during night hours,” an officer said.
 
 SMC officials, however, are not aware about exact figure of stray cattle in the city.
