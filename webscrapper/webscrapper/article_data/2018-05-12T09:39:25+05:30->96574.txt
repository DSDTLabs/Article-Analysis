KOLKATA: A fire broke out at an office room on the 10th floor of the 14-storey   building on   near   station on Friday night. Ten fire tenders reached the spot to douse the flames. While no one was hurt, the exact cause of fire is yet to be ascertained. The situation remained tense as there was fear that the fire might spread to the other floors.

 
 Fire fighters said the fire broke out around 8:45pm. A short circuit in an office room had probably triggered the fire, said an official. The fire fighters were assisted by the Kolkata Policeâ€™s disaster management group and Bowbazar PS officers. The fire was brought under control by 10pm after which the cooling process began. The extent of damage is yet to be known.
