AHMEDABAD: Existence of the girl child in Gujarat, which shot to national infamy with a skewed child   (CSR) of 886 girls per 1,000 boys in Census 2001, continues to be under threat.

 After showing a marginal recovery in sex ratio at birth (SRB) between years 2007 and 2014 where the number of girls rose above 900 per 1,000 boys born, Gujarat has once again come under the scanner as it recorded an alarming fall of 63 points in   between years 2011-13 and 2014-16. This is the highest fall recorded in average SRB in any state in the country.
  
 The SRB of 848 in 2014-16 is in fact one of the lowest ever recorded by the state since year 2005-07 when the number of girls born were 891per 1,000 boys.
  
  
 
 The Niti Aayog’s latest report, titled ‘Healthy States, Progressive India’, too highlights dismal outcomes in India’s child sex ratio at birth (SRB). The report shows most steep decline in sex ratio in Gujarat, where the SRB fell to 854 females in 2013-15 from 907 females per 1,000 males born in 2012-14.
 
 
 
 
 The Sample Registration Survey (SRS) 2016 data released by the office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, India, reveals a further decline. From average SRB of 911recorded in 2011-13, the numbers have dipped to 848 girls per 1,000 boys at birth in 2014-16.
 
 Gujarat is followed by Rajasthan where the numbers dipped by 36 points from 893 to 857.   saw a decline of 32 points from 864 to 832; Delhi recorded fall of 30 points from 887 to 857 and   registered a fall of 26 points from 943 to 917 during the five years between 2011-13and 2014-2016.
 
  
  
 During this time period, the national average SRB released in blocks of two years dropped by 11points from 909 to 898.
 
 Experts say that while SRS data is not as absolute as the Census data, the alarming fall in numbers of girl child indicates continued bias against the girl child. They also say that for longterm social change, government have to be committed to persistent programmes, deterring drives and awareness campaigns.
 
 Sociologist   says: “More families, even in rural areas, are embracing one child norm due to economic and social constraints especially if the first born is a son.
 
 “Declining numbers also indicate that sex determination and resultant killing of girl child in the womb has not stopped; it has only gone underground. Strict implementation of Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PCPNDT) Act eludes the state as unlike Haryana which has over 50 doctors behind bars, Gujarat has only filed cases, no doctor is serving a jail sentence .”
 
 Social researcher and ex-director of   (GIDR) Leela Visaria says: “Strict implementation or monitoring is very unlikely to work. I firmly believe we need better understanding of the dynamics of family formation of Indian households. The limited understanding based on micro-level research suggests that with the widespread acceptance of small family norm, couples prefer one son and one daughter as ideal family composition and if the first born is a girl, then effort to ensure that the second child is a son leads to practices that are in violation of the enacted rules.”
