Navi Mumbai: The Panvel civic body is unlikely to take over garbage cleaning from   from Friday. The deadline set by Cidco expires on Thursday midnight. 

  took files related to   management from Cidco a week ago. However, the town planning body has asked its 22 contractors to stop work but will continue to provide emergency services like maintaining urban health centres and crematoriums.
 
 Cidco chief health officer Dr   said, “Our contractors have been asked to discontinue their services with effect from March 16.” 
 
 A Cidco sanitary inspector (Kharghar node) said around 22 contractors have been asked to stop road sweeping, garbage cleaning and vector control programmes in PCMC areas. Around 750 contract workers will be losing their jobs.
 
 At the time of going to press, the PCMC chief was in a meeting with the chief minister on the issue. “We are awaiting a decision,” PCMC health and sanitation committee president Dr A Bhagat said. 
 
 Requesting anonymity, a PCMC sanitary inspector said, “There is no chance of PCMC lifting garbage in Cidco-developed nodes. No tenders have been invited and other arrangements like vehicles for lifting of garbage have also been done.”
 
 BJP leader   said Cidco has been doing what the Panvel civic body should be doing. “We have been demanding for long that PCMC takes over the garbage lifting work.”
