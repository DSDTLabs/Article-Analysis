This one won’t be like the local   we’d revel in when it would visit town; promises circus performer   from France. He, along with   (also from France), will perform their creation,   (Don’t Tangle), at   auditorium on January 24, at 7 pm. Part of their ongoing India-Nepal tour, the “new kind of circus show” is replete with acrobatics and juggling. 

 Hugo opines, “Circus art is different, because unlike most scenic art forms that start with an intellectual idea before transcending into physical movements, it starts from a physical difficulty, around which an impression of virtuosity is built.” Their piece, created over two years, mixes 
 theatre, dance and the clown universe, creating absurd situations between the characters played by Anouck and Hugo. 
 
 Anouck’s technical acrobatics and wide-eye innocence complement Hugo’s stage presence. “We have chosen a theatre approach seen in the 
 Commedia dell’arte (first form of professional theatre) and utilised in clown performance, that involves exaggerating traits, allowing freedom for improvisation,” adds Hugo.
 
 And what can the audience expect? “The show is about intimate moments filled with simplicity and pleasure. Just come along with curiosity, that’s a lot already,” says Hugo.
