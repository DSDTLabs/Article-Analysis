Coimbatore: The R S Pumar police on Wednesday arrested two men in connection with the   and assault of a 41-year-old man. 

 On February 9, two men - Ashwin and   - along with five of their accomplices kidnapped K  , who runs   on TV Samy Road at RS Puram. He had borrowed Rs 22 lakh from Ashwin, a month ago, but failed to repay it. The financer had taken away his car as he was a defaulter. 
 
 Subsequently, Dhanraj approached the RS Puram (law & order) police station to file a complaint. Ashwin, who was called to the station, requested him not to lodge a complaint. However, later, Ashwin and his friend Arun who has a red sanders smuggling case against him, waited for Dhanraj in car on DB Road. 
 
 The duo managed to kidnap Dhanraj and took him to a faraway location, where five others joined them. After beating him severely, they dropped him near his house. On Wednesday, police arrested Karthik Kannan, Ashwin’s driver and Agnesh, Ashwin’s younger brother. Nevertheless, they are yet to nab the main accused- Ashwin and Arun. tnn
