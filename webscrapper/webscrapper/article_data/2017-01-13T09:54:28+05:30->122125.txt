LUCKNOW: No matter in whose favour the   rules on Friday, chief minister   will ‘vroom’ ahead with his preparations for the UP polls. Sources in   said Akhilesh has readied a backup plan that will kick in, in case the   freezes the Samajwadi Party’s name and bicycle symbol, mandating both warring factions of the erstwhile SP to contest the elections with a new party name and symbol.

 A senior functionary in the SP camp said, “Some people on Netaji (Mulayam)’s side are trying everything to make sure the symbol is frozen. Even under these circumstances, CM will forge his way forward with a minor modification to the party’s existing name, and also a symbol.”
 
 The formal launch of Akhilesh’s new outfit—the Akhil Bharatiya Samajwadi Party with the motorcycle symbol—will have to wait for the EC’s nod on Friday. Sources told TOI the EC will hear both sides on their claims to the SP and the bicycle and will freeze the symbol only if it remains undecided about which side to rule in favour of. “Akhilesh is staking claim to the Samajwadi Party and the bicycle symbol. That is why he is not in a hurry to declare formation of any new political outfit or symbol. Only when the bicycle and the SP is handed over to Mulayam, or if is becomes unusable for either will   be announced,” said an SP MP. 
 
 A section of the SP favouring Akhilesh also said the current impasse served the CM with a “golden opportunity” to make a fresh start, putting him in the riding seat of the motorcycle, and ridding him of the baggage that the bicycle symbol carried.
