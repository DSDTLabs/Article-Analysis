GUWAHATI: The All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) and 28 other groups have demanded that the state government declare the   a proscribed organization. 

 Workers of the outfit recently attacked an Aasu office in Dhemaji district's Silapathar.
 
 In a meeting here on Friday, the groups said they would urge the Centre to adopt steps to safeguard the interests of the indigenous people of Assam. While the Nikhil Bharat Bangali Udbastu Samannay Samiti has been spearheading a country-wide movement seeking citizenship for Hindu Bengalis in Assam, Aasu has been staunchly opposed to any such rights for 'foreigners'.
 
 "In the first week of April, we will meet Union ministers and urge them to rid Assam of illegal migrants. The government has failed to arrest  , the prime accused in the Silapathar incident," chief adviser of   said.
 
 On April 1, the 29 organizations will stage a protest in Guwahati to highlight their demands - withdrawal of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, implementation of the Assam Accord and completion of the   update at the earliest.
 
 The organizations also warned the Centre and the state government against going ahead with their plans to construct the 2000MW Lower Subansiri Hydroelectric Project in Gerukamukh along the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border.
 
 "The people of Assam will suffer if the dam is constructed. We will go to any extent to thwart the project," Bhattacharyya said.
