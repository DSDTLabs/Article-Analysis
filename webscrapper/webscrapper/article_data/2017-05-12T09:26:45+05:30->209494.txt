After the engagement of singer   and telly star   (  and Mahabharat fame) in February at Jalandhar, everyone was waiting for the couple's wedding. However, we hear the wedding date has been pushed further due to professional commitments of Yuvraj.
 
 With two film releases lined up for YuvrajLahoriye, Chhajju Da Chubara, the nuptials might take place early next year. Says Hans Raj Hans, Yuvraj's dad, “After the roka ceremony Yuvraj got busy with work. So, I did not insist upon it as it's his wish. Right now, wedding dates have not been decided.“
 
  
  
 On the excitement that's brewing at the Hans household with Yuvraj's elder bro Navraj, who is giving a number for RGV's Sarkar 3, and bhabhi Ajit Kaur (Daler Mehndi's daughter) preparing for the occasion, Hans Raj says, “Saada ki hai. I just have to quickly put on a turban for the wedding. I am not a khadoos baap, and I let my kids take their own decisions.“
  
 Given the fact that it's a family of singers, its little surprise then that music will be the flavour of all functions. The musical influences are also expected from the Hans' extended family, represented by Daler's daughter Ajit.
  
 “I am eagerly waiting for another angel (Mansi) to join us,“ says Hans, “Both my daughters in law are very close to me. God has been kind as my sons did not falter and took the singing-acting route which they always desired.“
