KOLKATA: Support in the education sector and boost to trade were the key points of discussion when British high commissioner   met chief minister   on Thursday. 

 Expressing her wish to start exchange programmes between   and top British varsities, Mamata seized the opportunity to ask if the British government could help improve the infrastructure for the 200-year-old institute as well as the rest of the education sector. 
 
 Describing it a "courtesy call" at Nabanna, Asquith said there were talks about boosting trade, while state sources pointed out they discussed how British companies could be utilized in urban regeneration and if their expertise could be used to deck up Kolkata's river-front, similar to that of the Thames. Mamata also mentioned her dream project of setting up a London Eye-like Kolkata Eye by the Hooghly. Another interesting point of discussion was British experts' help for the renovation and preservation of heritage buildings in Kolkata, with Mamata keen on redesigning Writers' Buildings. 
 
 Talking about the recent business summit, Mamata asked Asquith if more British companies could have their presence here; she also wanted  , which withdrew services here in 2009, to be back.
