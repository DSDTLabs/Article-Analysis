Madurai: A lot of trading activities depend on mobile phones and modern applications like WhatsApp enabled traders to send invoices, receipts and orders over phone. After Aircel announced its closure and non-availability of its network, it has driven many traders to a corner, as they are not able to carry out their regular transactions over phone in last few days.

 “It was like a surprise attack, slitting the throat of a person, as hundreds of traders and vendors have been using this particular network. Orders have to be placed, outstanding has to be collected and this failing network has put us all in a serious trouble,” rued P S Murugan, president of Mattuthavani central vegetable market.
 
 Further, the GST registrations, sales tax information are all connected to their mobile phones. When such crucial information is not delivered in phones, trading community is severely hit, said secretary of Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry, G Elangovan. He also alleged that many mobile dealers have been dumped with recharge coupons and valets of the network provider, and whoever invested in these coupons or valets are worst affected. “It is like complete chaos and we appeal to the government to intervene and set things right for a while, so that we will have a breathing time to change our service providers,” he added.
