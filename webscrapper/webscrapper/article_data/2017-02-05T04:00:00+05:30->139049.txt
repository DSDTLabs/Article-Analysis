Vadodara: The National Federation of Indian Railwaymen (NFIR), Western Railway Mazdoor Sangh (WRMS) and other zonal railway unions affiliated with NFIR will hold demonstrations in all the 16 zonal railways of Indian Railways on Monday (February 6) to lodge protest against government of India’s move to finish trade union movement of the Indian Railways.  J G Mahurkar, vice president of NFIR and general secretary of WRMS said this here on Saturday.  “There is an announcement by the government that railway supervisors working as junior engineers and senior engineers in grade pay Rs 4,200 and Rs 4,600 cannot remain office bearers of trade union after March 31, 2017 to improve safety. This is an example of high handedness of the government to finish the trade union movement of Indian Railways which has played a constructive role since last over 60 years. This is not permitted by the Trade Union Act 1926,” said Mahurkar. “This is fabrication of truth because there are only 1.5% supervisors who are office bearers of recognised federation – NFIR. The government in its budget has totally neglected other areas where inputs are required, but funds are not available to improve safety of Indian Railways,” said Mahurkar, adding that government wants to destroy trade union movement of the Indian Railways.  He said that so far no pay commission has ever stopped special allowance being paid to railway employees because of difficult working condition. “Seventh pay commission has stopped all allowances without giving any reasons. NFIR requests to release allowances is still pending with the committee of finance department,” he said. “When the government is claiming that they want to create job opportunities for youngsters, they are not filling 1.20 lakh vacancies in the safety categories of railways since last more than two years. Because of these vacancies, railwaymen are living a bad and uncomfortable life,” he said.
