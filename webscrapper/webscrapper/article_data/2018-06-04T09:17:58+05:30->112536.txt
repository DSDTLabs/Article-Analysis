BATHINDA: The   State Power Corporation Ltd ( ) has completed the recruitment process for various categories and appointment letters to 3,678 people will be handed over on Monday. The categories where recruitments have been made include junior engineers, sub-station assistants, lower division clerks and assistant linemen.

 Punjab power minister Gurpreet Singh   on Sunday said appointment letters will be handed over to 300 junior engineers, 330 lower division clerks, 248 sub-station attendants and 2,800 assistant linemen soon. Assistant linemen have been waiting for jobs for the last many years and have demanded that all vacancies be filled. Those still unemployed, claim there are nearly 4,300 linemen and assistant linemen vacancies that need filling.
 
 Holding a sangat darshan programme at   village, Kangar said, “Chief minister Amarinder Singh, while fulfilling the promise of providing jobs, will hand over appointment letters to 3,678 unemployed people”.
 
 Meanwhile, Aam Admi Party MLA Pirmal Singh Khalsa, who before his election as MLA from   assembly constituency in 2017 had been taking part in protests for jobs to unemployed linemen, said, “There are nearly 4,300 unemployed linemen in Punjab and the state government is recruiting 2,800. We will not sit back and will hold protests. Earlier my mother Ranjit Kaur had taken part in similar protest for jobs for the unemployed at Patiala on May 22”.
 
 He said the previous SAD-BJP and the present Congress government had promised to provide jobs to unemployed linemen but now the government had lowered the post and the assistant linemen would be getting Rs 7,200 per month for two years.
 
 In 2011, unemployed linemen pass outs led by now MLA Pirmal Singh Khalsa, had started protest demanding jobs for 5,000 of them. The government had given jobs to 1,000 linemen in 2011 and then again in 2013, leaving behind 3,000 unemployed.
 
 In the meantime, another 1,300 people have completed the apprenticeship for linemen’s jobs, raising the number again to 4,300.
 
 The Technical Services Union of the PSPCL too is for appointment for all the unemployed. TSU activist Narain Dutt said though the state government was making claims to hand over appointment letters to 2,800 assistant linemen but as per PSPCL officials the recruitment process of only 1,700 people has been completed and appointment letters will be provided to 1,700 and rest of the 1,100 assistant linemen will be provided letters after completion of the process.
