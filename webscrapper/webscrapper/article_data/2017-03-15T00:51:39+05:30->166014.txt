Gurgaon: A seven-member sub-committee of the Allottee Grievance Redress Forum (AGRF) has been set up in Gurgaon for speedy disposal of homebuyers’ grievances. It will hold its first meeting on  . 

 Officials said on Tuesday around a dozen issues related to developers and   projects would be taken up in the meeting. The AGRF sub-committee was set up by the deputy commissioner last month for fast disposal of complaints and continuous monitoring of the delayed projects in the wake of a large number of complaints of homebuyers against real estate projects and developers.
 
 “Around a dozen issues related to several developers in the city — including Suncity, Vatika, Unitech, Adel Landmarks, Puri Construction, ABW Infrastructure, Universal Buildwell, and Today Home and Infrastrucure — are likely to be discussed in the panel’s first meeting. The committee may also issue certain directions for the resolution of homebuyers’ grievances,” said a senior official of the department of town and country planning (DTCP).
 
 “After the meeting, the chairman of the sub-committee will submit an action taken report to the chairman of AGRF (the deputy commissioner of Gurgaon) for necessary action. Unresolved complaints will be taken by the deputy commissioner in the next meeting of AGRF,” said the official. In order to address the problems of homebuyers in private developer areas in a time-bound manner, the state government had constituted AGRF in Gurgaon in September 2015. Since then, AGRF had held four meetings — in September 2015, January, August and September 2016 — and taken up over 150 complaints.
 
 To make AGRF more effective and organised forum for disposal of real estate-related complaints, deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh constituted the sub-committee in February this year.
 
 The senior town planner of DTCP has been appointed the chairperson of the sub-committee and the district town planner its member secretary.
