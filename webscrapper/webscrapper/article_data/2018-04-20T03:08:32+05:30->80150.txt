MUMBAI: There was no respite from the   and   on Thursday, with a high of 35.2 degrees Celsius recorded at the IMD suburban station. 

 On Thursday, the Colaba observatory of the India Meteorological Department recorded a maximum   of 34 degrees Celsius, which was 1.6 degrees Celsius above normal. At the suburban Santacruz observatory, the maximum of 35.2 degrees Celsius was 2.4 degrees above normal.
 
 “Hot air coming from the northern parts of the country, especially Gujarat, is why the temperatures are seen going up,” IMD scientist Ajay Kumar said. “But owing to a change in pattern of circulation over the Arabian Sea, we are expecting a meagre decline.”
 
 The minimum temperature recorded by IMD Colaba was 27 degrees Celsius, which was 1.9 degrees Celsius above normal. The minimum at Santacruz was 24.6 degrees Celsius, which was 0.4 degree Celsius above normal. The relative humidity recorded by Colaba and Santacruz observatories was 63% and 40%, respectively.
