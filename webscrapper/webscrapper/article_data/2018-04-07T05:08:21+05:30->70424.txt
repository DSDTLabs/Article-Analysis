MUMBAI: While former   of Mumbai University   had to step down for the chaos that followed the implementation of online assessment, the selection of his successor could well be on the basis of how he can clear the mess. On Saturday, the 32  , who will be interviewed in the coming week, have to submit their presentation, which will include suggesting solutions for the results’ problem that has plagued the university for some time now. 

 One of the candidates, said a university official, even visited the   this week to understand the current process, while another was part of the university’s technical committee that had investigated the results mess last year. 
 
 One of the candidates told TOI that resolving the examination mess is an urgent need of the hour and will definitely come up in the interview. “The new VC is likely to assume office by the end of this month and the biggest challenge for him/her would be to deliver results of the ongoing exam on time. It would be an obvious requirement in the presentation and candidates are expected to be prepared with solutions,” said the aspirant. According to him, several measures could be taken to reduce the time consumed between the scanning of papers and the onscreen assessment. “The scanning process could be decentralised,” he added.
 
 Another aspirant, whose interview is scheduled on April 14, said filling vacant posts is one of the prime concerns for the university. “The new VC needs to focus on appointments too. Many key posts are lying vacant or are held by ad hoc candidates.”
