INDORE: Fondness for packaged clean pulses in households is pushing dal mills to adopt modern machineries and updated technology as it will also cut down wastage and improve quality. Inclination to this modern technology was noticed on the first day of a three-day exhibition organised in the city by All India Dal Mill Association on Friday.

 “Demand for quality and hygienic product is increasing everywhere. Modern machineries help in improving the quality of the product and reducing wastage,” said a dal mill owner  .
 
 Outdated technology used in dal mill industry is leading to higher wastage of goods and poor quality. According to the association only about 10 per cent of the dal mill industry in the Indore region use modern technology machines for cleaning and sorting pulses. 
 
 Dal mills purchase raw pulses from the market and then process it into dal of various grades. On processing 60 per cent comes out as dal while 25 per cent goes as cattle feed and the rest is wasted, experts said. 
 
 Over 100 leading machinery manufacturers of dal mill and packaging industry from across the world participated in a three day exhibition began from Friday. Exhibitors displayed and gave live demonstration of several modern technology machineries at the event. 
 
 Participants from Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Chattisgarh, Karnataka and foreign destination including China, Turkey, Japan, Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Germany and UK were also present in the event.
 
 “Industry will get a lot of information about modern machineries used in the dal mill sector across the world in these 3 days. About 110 companies have participated in this event of which 10 are from foreign destinations,” said All India Dal Mill Association (Indore) chairman Suresh Agrawal.
 
 According to the All India Dal Mill Association the footfall on the first day of the exhibition was about 2,000 which is expected to increase on weekends.
