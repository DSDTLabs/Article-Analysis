It is all the more disturbing that nobody, including the CM, tried to save or prevent the assault, which clearly indicates prior conspiracy and collusion of all present. The chief secretary was being forced to violate the law of the land laid down by  , which he correctly refused.”

 “This conduct of the government of Delhi tantamounts to criminal action, which are punishable under IPC,” the association says, demanding registration of criminal cases against those who assaulted Prakash. Everybody else present is guilty of abetment, it declares.
 
 “The incident clearly shows that in the state government of Delhi, there is complete breakdown of constitutional scheme of governance. The assault on head of state civil services to compel him for the gains of a political party against the law attracts provisions of Article 356. In the current scenario, rule of law cannot be ensured in Delhi. Therefore, we demand that the incumbent government of Delhi be dismissed and President’s rule may be imposed,” the association says.
