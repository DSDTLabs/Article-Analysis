LUCKNOW: Chief minister and   president Akhilesh Yadav’s schedule of election campaigning has kept him too busy to notice that a minister in his cabinet   is continuing to hold the post despite having defected to the principal opposition party  .

 Mishra was elected MLA from Ghazipur district on SP ticket and appointed minister in the state government. But before elections, as national president of the party Akhilesh denied him ticket. In protest, he quit the party and office of minister and joined the BSP in presence of the party’s general secretary Satish Chand Mishra in Lucknow in January.
 
 A number of MLAs and former ministers owing allegiance to the Samajwadi Party have defected to the rival political parties, mainly the BJP and the BSP. But Mishra’s case is different.
 
 Highly placed sourced in Raj Bhawan told ToI on Friday that the chief minister had not accepted Vijay Mishra’s resignation yet, nor recommended his acceptance to Governor Ram Naik.
 
 Technically, Vijay Mishra continues to be a minister despite being in BSP and campaigning for it against the chief minister, who has not yet got time to accept the resignation and send it to Raj Bhawan.
