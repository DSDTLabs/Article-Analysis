ONGOLE: Coming down heavily on chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, senior   leader and former Union minister   has termed the induction of   legislators in the cabinet   and unconstitutional. She felt the legislators, who had switched loyalties to another party, should have quit their posts. 

 Purandeswari dashed off letters to Prime Minister   and party president Amit Shah explaining the need to discourage the practice of defections to protect democratic values. She said that four legislators who won on the symbol of another party were inducted into the cabinet in AP on April 2 which is a gross disrespect to the X Schedule of the Constitution. "I personally feel that it is undemocratic to encourage such practices particularly as a coalition partner. It is unfortunate that luring of legislators from other parties is going on despite X Schedule prohibiting such practices," she said.
 
 Purandeswari urged the prime minister and party president Amit Shah to bring in a new and stringent law to prohibit such practices.
