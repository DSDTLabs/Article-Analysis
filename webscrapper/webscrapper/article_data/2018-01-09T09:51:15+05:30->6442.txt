The Supreme Court discussed on Monday the affidavit of suspended Manipur police commando   who has claimed that he witnessed a large number of fake encounters carried out in the state between 2003 and 2009. 

  The affidavit by Herojit, once considered an encounter specialist, was admitted as a criminal miscellaneous petition case.   and   heard the plea that the diaries seized by CBI in 2010, where he gave detailed entries of the operations, be produced in court. The SC then observed that his statements can be recorded by a chief judicial magistrate in Delhi. After being suspended, Herojit, made a startling revelation that he gunned down reformed militant   inside a pharmacy in Imphal.
