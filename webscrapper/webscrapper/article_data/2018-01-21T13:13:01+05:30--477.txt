 has sent a notice against a leading television channel for body shaming actor   in one of the shows. The Sangam’s general secretary has sent a letter to the channel on behalf of the association.The statement reads:

  Subject: Marking of protest and seeking action against untasteful and unacceptable mocking and trolling on your program.
 
 Sir, Recently in one of “Sun Music" channel program the show hosts (two young girls), literally., stocked and trolled the physical appearance of one of our respected senior members, Mr. Suriya under the pretext of film news chat. It is a real cause of concern and shock to witness such indecent and derogatory comments in a channel program about an individual. The fact that a movie star may be in the public eye does not warrant such pejorative discussions in a public medium such as yours.
 
 We would like to highlight that an actor, like every other citizen, has right to privacy, personal space, basic respect, decency and equal protection under Law. Sun Network should not have permitted the telecast of such defaming and disparaging content.
 
 Being our long-standing partner in the media space, we welcome any constructive and decent criticism of our work from Sun Network. However, we will not tolerate or excuse such insensitive talk shows that are aimed at hurting one of our senior members and respected actor. We demand immediate and stern action against the show hosts who exhibited such indecency and an assurance that such chat shows in bad taste would not be telecast on your network channels.
 
 We look forward to your immediate response and corrective action so that we do not induce any strain in our ongoing relationship.
 
 Regards
 For INDIAN ARTISTES' ASSOCIATION General Secretary
