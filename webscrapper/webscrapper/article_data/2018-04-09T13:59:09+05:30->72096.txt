PANAJI: Two days after the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2018 was declared, Goa   has said that it has been able to maintain its rank in the top 75 universities in the country despite increased competition.   slid four positions in 2018 to 68th rank as compared to last year.

 Goa University has issued a statement on its website, where it has said that the small   has successfully maintained its presence in the 75 universities in the country for the third consecutive year, “despite   being a relatively young university, its small size, the increased competition from existing participants and new entrants applying for ranking”.
 
 The statement also claims that it has actually improved its rank in the overall category of NIRF climbing to the 98th position from being in the 100-150 band in 2017.
 
 “Goa University improved its ranking in NIRF (2018 edition), which was released on April 3, 2018, by the Union ministry for human resource development,” reads the statement. “In the ‘Overall’ ranking, GU moved up to the 98th place (from among 957 higher educational institutions). This is an improvement over its ranking in 2017 when GU was placed in the 100-150 band (from among 724 higher educational institutes).”
 
 In 2017, after Goa University’s rank saw a massive slide from 2016’s 20th rank to 64th in 2017, the varsity had written to the ministry, pointing out flaws in the NIRF ranking process where institutes, big and small, are compared purely on quantitative scale and not based on averages of faculty available, funds, research output, etc. The university has said a comparison of NIRF’s 2018 with 2017 ranks shows that 20 new universities have found a place in the top 100, and while nine of them were ranked above GU, another eight that were placed above GU in 2017 do not feature in this list in 2018.
