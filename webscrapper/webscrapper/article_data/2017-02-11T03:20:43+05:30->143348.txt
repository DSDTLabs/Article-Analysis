CHENNAI:   general secretary   sacked presidium chairman   from the party on Friday, a day after he joined ranks with O   in the ongoing contest between the two to be J Jayalalithaa’s successor. She appointed former minister K A Sengottaiyan as the new chair of AIADMK presidium.

 The expulsion came within hours of Madhusudanan sending a memorandum to the  , demanding that Sasikala’s appointment as AIADMK’s interim general secretary be declared null and void as “it violates party bylaws”. Madhusudanan later told mediapersons that he had expelled   much before she announced his removal.
 
 “Madhusudanan has violated the party principles and brought disrepute to the party. He has been removed from the primary membership of the party,” Sasikala said.
 
 Madhusudanan said in the evening that the cadres must get ready soon for the election of a general secretary.
 
 “I sent a fax to chief election commissioner Nasim Zaidi and two other commissioners stating that the bylaws framed by our founder   said that the general secretary should be elected by the primary members of the party. MGR wanted every party flag-bearer to vote in the election. By that scale, the election of Sasikala is null and void,” said Madhusudanan.
 
 Madhusudanan said the party bylaws specified that only a person with five continuous years of membership could become general secretary. “Sasikala is ineligible, because she will complete five years only on March 30,” he said.
 
 It is pertinent to note that during Sasikala’s appointment as general secretary, both Panneerselvam and Madhusudanan were in the party and had supported the decision. Madhusudanan was among the first few leaders to visit Sasikala to persuade her to take over the party reins.
