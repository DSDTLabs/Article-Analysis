BHUBANESWAR: The economic offences wing ( ) of the   on Friday arrested two persons,   and his son  , for their alleged involvement in a chit fund scam of nearly Rs 3 crore. 

  The ponzi firm, Creative Express Events and Promoters, had allegedly collected money from hundreds of investors between 2015 and 2016. The EOW had registered a cheating case against the company on January 27, 2017. Sampad and Ajitesh were directors of the company, sources said. 
 
 The probe agency said the company lured people, mostly acquaintances of Jogania, to invest in the firm with the promise of high returns. Towards the end of 2016, the company had shut down its office in   here and the accused had fled when duped investors demanded refunds. "We had arrested the scam's prime conspirator and founder of the company   on September 6, 2017. The father-son duo were on the run since the registration of the case," an EOW officer said. 
 
 The EOW sources said the duo, who used to run a small shop in the city, came in contact with   and joined hands with him to start the business in 2015. The EOW officials said the accused were unfazed by the massive public outcry over the chit fund scam that surfaced in 2013-14. 
 
 "We found that the father and his son played a key role in mobilising money from people. When people started asking for interests, they offered them two options, either to collect interests or take land in the city," the officer said. 
 
 To avoid the investors, the accused kept giving them different deadlines to either return their money or give land. "When we realized that we have been cheated, we approached the EOW. The probe agency should detect the assets of the company and freeze the bank accounts of the accused so that we get our money back," said  , an investor.
