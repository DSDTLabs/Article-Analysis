KOLKATA: The Purba Jadavpur police have made the fifth arrest in the probe related to the death of   examinee Arijit Das. Accused Sk   Hossain (26), a resident of Jamalpur in  , was arrested from another private nursing home, Life Care Nursing Home, in Burdwan. “We arrested the accused around 10.45pm on Thursday,” said DC (east)  .

 
  
  
 According to police, the accused would lure the kin of patients like Das to take help of fake doctors and paramedics while transporting them from Burdwan to Kolkata hospitals. The kin of Das, too, were allegedly lured by Toffajjal more than a week ago leading to the unfortunate death of the Madhyamik candidate.
 
 Police said that accused  , the owner of Annapurna Nursing Home where Das was admitted, and Sk Ruhul Islam, the manager, had called up Vicky, the owner of four ambulances, telling him that they needed an ambulance to shift Das to Kolkata. Vicky is presently absconding.
 
 An unidentified ambulance driver, who reportedly drove an ambulance owned by Vicky, had convinced Das’s father to admit his son to the Burdwan nursing home instead of driving him directly to Kolkata that was the initial plan.
 
 Vicky called up ambulance driver Tara Babu Sha (now arrested) and asked him to report at Annapurna Nursing Home. When Sha reached there, he found that the Das family was insisting on having a doctor in the ambulance and was ready to pay a high amount.
 
 Sha soon called up Toffajjal. “Tofajjal had worked as an ICU technician for a couple of years in two private hospitals in Kolkata. On his return to Burdwan, he recruited around eight semi-skilled youths and opened a centre to provide ICU operatives to various private hospitals. In case someone needed a paramedic to shift patients to Kolkata, it was his gang that provided men to patients’ kin,” said police. Toffajjal then directed   to pose as a doctor and present himself before Das.
