 turns scorpion

 TV makers are turning creative while introducing shape-shifting humans in their shows. After naagins and daayans, the latest to join the clan is Bichukhi — half human and half scorpion — in 'Khunkhar — Super Cops Vs Super Villains'. The character will be played by Neetha Shetty. The Werewolf clan will take Bichukhi’s help to kill the vampire clan in the show.
