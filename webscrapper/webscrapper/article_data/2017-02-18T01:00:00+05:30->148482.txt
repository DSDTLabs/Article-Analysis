Thousands of women in the world will envy   for the equation she has with the country’s most sought-after bachelor,  . Otherwise, how is it that she rode his custom-made   all around the studio premises while he watched from the sidelines? The actress was shooting for the actor’s home brand at a studio in Bandra on Thursday noon. During the tea-break, she decided to go spinning on his black cycle, which was parked in the shade of his vanity van. 

 “Amy and   had been shooting throughout the afternoon. It was around 6 pm when they decided to take a break. Dressed in short casual clothes and her hair pulled pack and tied neatly into a pony tail, Amy hopped on to the cycle with due permission from Salman.

While she took a round or two on the cycle, Salman’s guards ran alongside her for security reasons and brought her safely back to the floor she was shooting at,” says an eye-witness.
