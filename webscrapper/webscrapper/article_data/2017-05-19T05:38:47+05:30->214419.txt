LUCKNOW: Joining hands with   in its initiative of “No   No Petrol”, a city based non-government organisation (NGO) has decided to distribute 1,000 branded helmets to people who go for fuel refill at petrol pumps. According to UP   Dealers’ Association, they will work in phases to spread awareness about safety with helmet. Founder of NGO   foundation, Ashutosh Soti, said they wanted to encourage more and more people to wear helmets by distributing them for free. 

 Riding without helmets is still one of the traffic offences committed most often. There have been over 50,000 challans since January this year of which over 70% were issued for riding without helmets. According to traffic norms, challan of Rs 1,000 is slapped for rash driving. For no helmet, the challan is for Rs 100 which, said traffic officials, a lot of people pay on the spot. 
 
 On Wednesday, SSP Deepak Kumar met Lucknow Petrol Pump Dealers’ Association to implement the law. Kumar has also directed SOs and SHOs to train filling staff at the petrol pumps for three days on how to handle riders without helmets and counsel them to wear the helmet. He said repeat offenders would be dealt with sternly and they would not be provided fuel. The drive will start from May 21. According to Petrol Pump Dealers’ Association president Sudhir Bora, all dealers have been directed to warn the first-time offenders. But if the offence is repeated, they’d be refused fuel. The same would be identified with CCTV installed at petrol pumps.
 
 SP, traffic, Habibul Hasan said he would enforce the law as per the SSP’s directions.
 
 Ashutosh Soti, who lost his son in a road accident, said the NGO would start distributing helmets from next week.
