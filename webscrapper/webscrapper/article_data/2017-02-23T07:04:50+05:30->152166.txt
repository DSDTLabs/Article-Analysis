HYDERABAD: A team of labour department officials, which visited the fire-ravaged air cooler manufacturing unit   at Rajendranagar, has found that the employer violated several provisions of the Labour Act. In the first place, the firm did not register the names of the employees with the department and secondly, they did not pay minimum wages. 

 A three-member team, headed by deputy commissioner of labour (DCL) P Pramod Reddy, and comprising assistant commissioner of labour ( ) K Ravindra Reddy and assistant labour officer (ALO) of   district, P Prabhavathi, visited the unit to check the details of the victims and their wages. 
 
 “The unit owner, D Pramod Kumar, a resident of Karwan, had hired four workers for fabricating coolers under the name of ‘Enova’. As per the Interstate Migrant Workmen Act 1979, the employer has to register worker (employee) details in a register with age, area and state, but he did not follow it. The employer has to maintain an attendance register (roster) for record purpose. He failed to do that too,” ACL Ravindra Reddy told TOI. 
 
 Another major violation was that the unit owner did not pay wages to the workers as per the Labour Act. Also, the firm did not have trade licence and was running illegally. The unit owner said he had been engaging workers from Jharkhand for fabricating coolers for the past two years. The four workers Saddam, Irfan, Mujahid and Saha joined the unit last month. The two other victims were also from Jharkhand, but the unit owner did not know that the last two were working at his unit, the ACL added. 
 
 The labour department has served notices on the unit owner as per Labour Act to pay suitable compensation to the kith and kin of the victims. A detailed report on the incident will be sent to the commissioner of labour on Thursday, the official added.
