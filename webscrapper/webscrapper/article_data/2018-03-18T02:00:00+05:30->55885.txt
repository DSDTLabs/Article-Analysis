ARARIA/PATNA: Araria police on Saturday moved a local court seeking permission to send the video, in which three youths are seen raising pro-Pakistan slogans, to forensic science laboratory (FSL) in Patna.

 The video had gone viral after the victory of RJD candidate Sarfaraz Alam in the byelection in the Muslim-dominated Araria parliamentary constituency. Araria SP Dhurat Saayli Savlaram said the video would be sent to FSL after court’s permission.
 
 Meanwhile, police claimed two of the arrested youths – Shahzad Alam (19) and Sultan Azmi (19) – have admitted that they had raised slogans such as ‘Pakistan zindabad’ and ‘Bharat tere tukde honge’ a day after RJD’s victory in the Araria Lok Sabha byelection. The third accused, Abid Raza (21), is still to be arrested.
