Pune: A 21-year-old Yemen national was arrested on Tuesday for knocking down a two-wheeler with his car, which left one person dead and another injured on Monday night. The incident took place on the gradient near KJ College at Yewalewadi at around 8.30pm.

 The Kondhwa police arrested Ayaz Mohammad Al-Amri, a first-year commerce student in a city-based college. He has been residing in Undri. According to the police, Al-Amri was also driving without a valid licence.
 
 The deceased has been identified as Parshuram Dalvi while the injured person is Vinod Shendkar, both from Purandar taluka. Both the men were not wearing helmets at the time of the accident. The complaint was lodged by Prakash Bhalerao and Chetan Shendkar, who were eyewitnesses to the incident. In fact, Al-Amri had rashly overtaken Bhalerao’s car before knocking down Dalvi’s two-wheeler, which was coming from the opposite direction. 
 
 The car driver sped away without checking on the injured or informing the police. A police team rushed to the spot after Bhalerao called the control room. Dalvi died due to multiple injuries while Shendkar is undergoing treatment.
 
 MS Deshmukh, Kondhwa police assistant sub-inspector, said, “We have arrested the suspect from his residence for causing the death due to negligence, among other charges of the IPC and the Motor Vehicles Act.” Deshmukh added, “The suspect said the accident occurred because he had lost control of his vehicle. He said he panicked and sped away.”
