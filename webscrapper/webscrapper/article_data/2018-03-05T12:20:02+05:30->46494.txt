NOIDA : A “technical glitch” has been preventing open school students from applying for   despite a Delhi High Court order allowing them to do so.

 A number of students said they were unable to complete the application process online as the website asked them to fill in details such as the year they passed Class XI and the name of the school and its address where they were enrolled.
 
 These details have turned out to be the stumbling block for students from the National Institute of Open Schooling as they directly write the exams for Class XII without appearing in Class XI. Many of the applicants said they tried to proceed without filling the details of Class XI but were prevented from submitting the form.
 
 The students have conveyed the problem to the NIOS authorities, who, in turn, have approached the CBSE, which conducts NEET.
 
  “On Friday, I tried filling the form for my son for   but the website kept asking the name of the school from where he has passed Class XI. NIOS students do not appear for Class XI tests. I left the space blank and proceeded with the form, but I was redirected to the page,” said MKS Raghav, whose son is preparing for NEET.
 
 An NIOS official said the issue could be solved only on Monday, the next working day. Board officials termed the problem a “technical glitch”. 
 
 “We are working on the problem. The students can fill only their Class XII details in the box and the system should accept,” said a CBSE spokesperson.
 
 Delhi High Court had last week allowed students from the   to fill NEET forms online, given that the last day of submission is March 9. 
 
 The court is yet to decided if the students would be allowed to write the exams.
