ROHTAK: With the   (INLD) workers leaving the   at   following the party’s call to re-dig the   (SYL) canal, hundreds of supporters of arrested preacher Rampal thronged the venue on Thursday.

 All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS), which has been holding dharnas for reservation in jobs and educational institutes to Jats since January 30, got the support of Rampal’s followers after its chief Yashpal Malik reached out to them.
 
 INLD has played a crucial role in mobilising support from the Jat community. Senior INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala had visited a number of AIJASS sit-ins in the last 22 days. He had even threatened to not let the state assembly function if the Jat community’s demands were not accepted by the Haryana government.
 
 INLD state president Satish Nandal had issued a press release from Rohtak, appealing to party workers to reach the Haryana-Punjab border to start digging of the SYL canal for claiming its share of water. Nandal said at least 15,000 INLD activists from Rohtak would reach the site for digging the canal.
 
 Admitting that INLD workers had left to support the canal issue, AIJASS member Pawan Hooda, who has been handling the Jassia sit-in, however denied that it had adversely affected the gathering at their site.
 
 “Even if the INLD workers had gone, we received an overwhelming support from Rampal’s supporters on Thursday. Later, some Delhi University students also joined the sit-in,” he said.
 
 Sources said in Sonipat also there was a dip in the number of people joining the sit-in at Jauli Lath village, but they went up later after supporters of some religious organisations came.
