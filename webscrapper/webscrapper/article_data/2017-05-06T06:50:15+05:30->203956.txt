 Tanmayi suffers from Morquio IV A, an inherited genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of a specific enzyme . This is a disease of metabolism in which the body is missing or does not have enough of a substance needed to break down long chains of sugar molecules. 
 
 A class III student of a school in Madhugiri, Tanmayi has been literally hobbled by the disorder. “She gets tired even if she walks a bit. However, she is a brilliant student. She has secured good marks in exams and has a sharp memory,” said Subrayappa, an agriculturist. 
 
 It all started after bouts of fever gripped Tanmayyi when she was seven months old. “She was healthy but started getting fever frequently. It was only when she was nine months old, we noticed that there’s a problem. She weighs 13 kg now and has not put on weight for couple of years. Her growth has been hampered,” he said.
 
 Tanmayi’s agriculturist parents took her to several hospitals in Delhi but there was no positive results. “I wonder what is so mysterious about my grandchild that we get no solution for her problem anywhere,” Subrayappa lamented.

 Dr Rejina said she has asked the girl’s grandfather to get in touch with a specialist at Victoria Hospital. “We will assist the child in all possible ways,” she added.
