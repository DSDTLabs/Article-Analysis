The pre-wedding rituals of Priyanka's wedding are in full swing when Kamini asks all married couples to come forth and give their blessings to the new couple.
 
  When Jhanvi calls out for   and Anika, Kamini turns her back and tells Jhanvi that she might not have listened to her properly as she called out for only married couples and taunts Shivaay for his relationship with Anika. Unstoppable Kamini further says that Shivaay and Ankia's relationship has no name and there is no base to their relationship. She says that Tia is Shivaay's wife according to all that she has heard and not Anika.
  
  Jhanvi tells Kamini that Anika is the daughter-in-law of their house, but Kamini doesn't listen and asks Shivaay to decide. He asks Anika to leave the venue and go to her room, when he sees Daksh smiling at him. Upset over the entire situation, Anika goes to her room.
  
  
 
  
  Later, Shivaay goes to his room and apologies to Anika. On being asked by her if he would let her down in front of everyone each time, Shivaay promises to not behave like this with her anymore.
  
  Anika gets up and goes out to help the house help with all the wedding work.
  
  Meanwhile, the entire family sits down to see the gifts that the bride and the groom have received.
