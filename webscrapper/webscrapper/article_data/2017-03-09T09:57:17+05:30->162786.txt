NEW DELHI:  , the son-in-law of the Congress party president  , on Thursday took on Delhi chief minister   over his "Vadra will eat him alive" remark.

 In a Facebook post, Robert Vadra slammed Kejriwal for inciting people against him and said, "Robert Vadra seems to be the most referred name in the dictionary of Delhi CM. His remarks "Vadra will eat him alive" depict a strange obsession for me." 
  
 “I would humbly request our Delhi CM to come and speak with me directly, for all his grudges he has against me, instead of inciting other people against me,” Vadra said, adding,"My best wishes to our Delhi CM, in all his endeavours."
 
 This comes a day after Kejriwal, during vote of thanks to the Delhi Lieutenant Governor’s address, accused Prime Minister   of targeting AAP minister  .
 
 “You can only arrest Satyendar Jain, not Dikshit. If the PM raises a finger against Robert Vadra, I’ll be convinced he has a 56-inch chest… Vadra will eat him alive… He (Modi) is taking revenge on the people of Delhi for choosing us, and has been blocking our work, but we have done so much despite the hindrance,"Kejriwal said in Delhi Assembly on Tuesday.
