NEW DELHI: In a view to ensure smooth movement of commuters at the new interchange stations of  , Delhi   Rail Corporation (DMRC) has installed 10 extra Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) gates at Hauz Khas and six extra AFC gates at Janakpuri West interchange station.

 As these stations are witnessing an increase in daily footfall since the opening of the Janakpuri West-Kalkaji Mandir section of Magenta Line, this move will help in decongesting entry and exit at these stations. “The total number of AFC gates has thus increased from 12 to 22 at Hauz Khas and from six to 12 at Janakpuri (West).
 
 In addition, the Old Hauz Khas metro station (Yellow Line) already has seven AFC gates and Janakpuri West station on Blue Line has 13 AFC gates,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. 
 
 “In the recent past, the number of trains and its frequency has increased on a few lines. On Red and Blue Line, three more trains have been added, increasing the total number to 29 and 64, respectively,” Dayal said. “Similarly, on Yellow Line, the total number of trains has increased to 55 from 54,” he added.
 
 The increase in the number of trains has also resulted in the increase in total number train trips on these lines. The Red Line is operating 25 more trips and Blue Line is operating 43 more trips. “The total train trips have increased from 3,650 to 3,735 across network, including the fully operational Magenta Line,” Dayal added.
