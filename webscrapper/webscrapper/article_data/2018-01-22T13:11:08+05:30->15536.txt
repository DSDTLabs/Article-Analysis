Trichy: Upset by the present condition, staff members of the chemical metallurgical technical department ( ) have urged Prime Minister   to implement seventh pay commission recommendations immediately.

 The staff alleged that they have been unfairly treated by various   recommendations except the fourth one, even though they are huge part of railways. If the Indian railways was the lifeline of the nation, the CMT staff are the backbone of the Indian railways, said the members.
 
 This department is the watchdog of the quality of railways which ensures that quality products are inducted into the railway system by chemical and metallurgical inspection of materials purchased from trade as well as the railways own products. They registered their complaints a memorandum sent to the prime minister, on behalf of the CMT.
 
 “Though the IV CPCs recommendations have been implemented in letter and spirit, the VII   recommendations are not implemented,” said  , former secretary of Chemical Metallurgical Staff Association, Golden Rock Railway Workshop.
 
 “The whole CMT staff in the railways, about 1500 personnel, is struggling as a result of the situation. The CMT staffers are being recruited to chemical and metallurgical laboratory as CMAs in the grade pay Rs 4,200 in spite of their qualification such as BE, B Tech, Chemical Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, MSc in pure and Applied Chemistry. Whereas, their counterparts with BE (Mechanical and Electrical) are recruited as SSEs in grade pay Rs 4, 600,” he added.
