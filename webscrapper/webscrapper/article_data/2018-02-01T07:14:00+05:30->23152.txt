GURUGRAM: The Haryana education department will set up   in all government schools across the state from February 1. 

 For this, the schools will have to register themselves in an online forum created by the department that will provide information about   clubs. 
 
 Each   will have to enrol a minimum of 50 students into their road safety club.
 
 There are 2,442 private schools against 1,968 government schools in the state. While most of the private schools already have a road safety club, the government schools do not have any such provisions yet.
 
 In the initiative launched by the department, various types of programmes will be organised in the government schools of the state with regard to road safety and traffic rules. 
 
 Only students between classes 9 to 11 will be included in the club. The students will be given training by a teacher appointed by the school for the purpose of managing the club.
 
 The member students of these clubs will be informed on road safety first. Then these students in turn will make the rest of the school’s students aware about the same by organising interactive activities. 
 
 In order to ensure the formation of the club in each school, the activities will be recorded and sent to education directorate. 
 
 Ram Kumar, district education officer said, “The clubs will be formed in all the government schools as part of road safety campaign. The school management have been informed about this initiative. At the same time, block education officers will have to ensure that these clubs have been opened in all the secondary and senior secondary schools of their block. This campaign has been undertaken to sensitise students about road safety and how they should move on roads.”
