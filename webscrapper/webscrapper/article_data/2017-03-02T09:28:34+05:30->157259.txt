PANAJI: This year, the   is moving from one record to another. After the sun   than usual during January to make it the   in a decade, February’s extra glow has fetched it a  .
 
  The mean maximum temperature of 33.3 degrees Celsius (C) recorded during last month is the highest in a decade. “The month of February is one of the warmest in the last ten years,” director, meteorological centre at Altinho M L Sahu said.
  
  Earlier, the monthly mean maximum of 33.7 degrees C recorded during February 2013 was the highest in a long time. “An identical mean maximum of 33.3 degrees C of this month was also recorded in February 2015,” Sahu said.
  
  Many had heaved a sigh of relief that after the sultry weather in January, the second month appeared normal. But after the mercury suddenly surged to a discomforting 36.5 degrees C on Valentine’s Day, they knew they may have been mistaken.
  
  During that week the sun felt like a blazing furnace, without the comfort of the cooling sea breeze. After the Valentine Day horror, the maximum temperature remained stuck at 36.5 degrees C on February 15 only to soar to a record 36.6 degrees C on February 16, nearly five degrees above normal.
  
  “This was the highest temperature during February in ten years,” Sahu said.
  
  The all-time record of the hottest day in February was on February 29, 1984, when a maximum temperature of 38 degrees C was recorded by meteorologists at Altinho.
  
  The early morning hours, which were often cool during the winter season, had not much to cheer about in February, either. “The mean monthly minimum of 19.5 degrees C during February 2017 is also the highest for the last ten years,” Sahu said.
