PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad New Township Development Authority ( ) demolished 25 kuccha and permanent constructions over 25,000sqft in an anti-encroachment drive at Kalewadi Phata last week. 

 Vasant  , deputy engineer, PCNTDA, said it was the largest anti-encroachment drive of this year till now. “The 30-metre-wide high capacity mass transit route is in the development plan of the authority and  . It is a ring road that starts from Nashik Phata and goes via Rahatani, Spine Road and Chikhali . An 800-metre-long stretch of the route passes through   village, out of which we have planned to make 300 metres encroachment free this month,” he said.
 
 He added that the first phase of the drive started on Saturday along the   on Sangvi-Kiwale bus rapid transit system route.
 
 “The authority had sent notices three years ago for vacating the land as it is reserved for the high capacity mass transit route. We had also sent reminders repeatedly. But people did not vacate it. So we were forced to conduct the drive,” Naik said.
 
 Initially, the people tried to oppose the drive, but relented later. They were allowed to remove their valuables and belongings. Among the demolished structures were two-storied houses, automobile garages, godowns and a bungalow.
