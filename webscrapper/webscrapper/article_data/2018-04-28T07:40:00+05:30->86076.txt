Dharamshala: Farmers in border area villages of Himachal are suffering losses due to lack of proper markets. In Kangra district, farmers say they are forced to sell their produce in markets of Punjab at cheaper rates and lack of proper roads adds to transportation cost.

 Famers of Mand, Indora, Miami, Rey and Bogrwan say they are selling milk at Rs 25 per kg in Pathankot and Mukerian areas of Punjab. They produce sugarcane, which is sold to the sugar mills of the other states.
 
 “Our land holdings are different compared to the farmers of rest of Himachal. These are like those in neighbouring areas of Punjab, but there are no markets for us to sell our produce. So we are forced to sell this in Punjab at cheaper rates,” said Pooran Chand, a farmer of Mand village and secretary of Prayavarn Sngrakshan Samiti of the area.
 
 In addition to this, there are no proper roads in these border areas. Farmers, patients and old age people were the worst sufferers of roads lying in tatters, he adds.
 
 People believe that they were bearing the brunt of electing an independent candidate during 2012 elections in Himachal Pradesh.
 
 “I have a land holding of 15 acres. I produce sugarcane, wheat, rice and vegetables but there is no facility for us to sell our produce. We can produce cereals and government can procure it to supply the same at ration depot. The state should not make purchase from outside and should strengthen the local farmers” said Jatinder Singh Rana, a local farmer of the area.
 
 Present MLA from BJP Ritan Dhiman says, “The previous Congress government should not have done this to the people of this area, even if they failed to get an MLA from here. But now all the developmental works would be done here in this regime.”
