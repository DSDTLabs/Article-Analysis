Ex-lovers   and   recently came together to a walk the ramp for a charity fashion show. The duo walked down the ramp hand-in-hand and looked stunning in Manish Malhotra's creations. 

  
  
 Deepika looked like a dream in a heavily embellished lehenga with silver-white detailing, while Ranbir, on the other hand, looked dapper in a black bandhgala with elaborate embroidery work.
 
 Though the event happened over a week ago, a new video has surfaced online which has fans gushing over the former couple's animated conversation. In the video, we can see   speaking during the media interaction while Ranbir has a little chat with Deepika that ends with her looking the other way. It's no wonder why these two continue to be one of the best joids in  . 
 
  
  
 
 Deepika and Ranbir worked together in films like ‘Bachna Ae Haseeno’, ‘Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani’ and ‘Tamasha’, and stunned everyone with their extraordinary chemistry on-screen. This walk for the ace designer proved to be no different.
