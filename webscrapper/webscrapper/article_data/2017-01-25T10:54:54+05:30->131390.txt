LUCKNOW: Around a dozen outsiders have made it to BJP’s third list of 67 candidates   on Tuesday. 

 On top of the list is former BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya, who has got the ticket from his constituency Padrauna in Kushinagar district. Maurya has already managed a ticket for his son Utkarsh from Unchahaar. 
 
 The surprise is former BSP leader RK Chaudhary, who also has a political party called BS4. He has been given a ticket from Mohanlalganj (reserved) constituency. Chaudhary was earlier in talks with BJP for an alliance and was reportedly demanding three seats. 
 
 The list also brought curtains down on the possibility of Beni Prasad Verma’s son Rakesh joining the BJP and getting a ticket from Ramnagar. The candidate from that seat is former district unit chief of BJP Sharad Awasthi. 
 
 RK Patel, a former BSP leader and an ex-MLA, has got the BJP ticket from Maanikpur. NCP MLA from Campiyarganj in 2012 Fateh Bahadur Singh, the son of former chief minister Veer Bahadur Singh, has the ticket from that seat. Singh’s family joined the BJP a year ago.
 
 Similarly, sitting BSP MLA from Chillupar Rajesh Tripathi, who switched to BJP, has got a ticket from the same constituency. 
 
 Former BSP leader Dinanath Bhaskar has managed a ticket for himself from Araai (reserved) while   Chauhan, another former BSP leader, has got a ticket from Madhuban. Anil Rajbhar, a former SP leader who joined the BJP in Varanasi about a year ago, has been given a ticket from Shivpur.
