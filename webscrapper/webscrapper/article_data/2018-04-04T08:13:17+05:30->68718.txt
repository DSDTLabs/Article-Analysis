CHENNAI: The state government is likely to move the   urging amendments in the rules that will allow   to retain 50% of the postgraduate medical seats from the state quota for in-service candidates for admissions this academic year. It will also urge the court to direct the   to amend rules for postgraduate admissions so that the state can use its traditional methods of incentives while admitting students, said state health minister C Vijaya Baskar.

 The state selection committee is working on finalising the merit list based on PG NEET scores. The counselling process should be completed by the end of May. The state has already submitted a representation to the Medical Council of India and the Union health ministry, he said. The letter was based on the detailed study done by the six-member committee headed by   managing director P Umanath. “We have presented a copy of the report to them as well. If we don’t incentivise our doctors, we will not have adequate staff in rural areas and services will suffer,” said the minister.
 
 The committee has put 16 of the 32 districts in the state in the backward list because of an inadequate doctor-patient ratio, high vacancies in government departments or poor health indices. Senior public health experts like Mumbai-based T Sundararaman of the Tata Institute of Social Studies say that incentive marks, higher salaries and infrastructure development will encourage more doctors to work in rural areas.
 
 On Tuesday, a group of doctors from Doctors’ Association for Social Equality led by general secretary   met Union health minister J P Nadda to request NEET exemption for the state quota of seats.
 
 “We have also sought reservations of seats for BC and MBC students like those for SC/ST students,” he said.
