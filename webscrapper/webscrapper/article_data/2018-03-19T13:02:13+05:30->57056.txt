  : Chief minister   on Sunday announced regularisation of the home guards temporarily appointed during Simhastha 2016. 

 This came during a media interaction on the sidelines of a home guard convention at his residence. "2,790 people temporarily appointed as home guards during Simhastha 2016 will be absorbed as regulars at a fixed salary of Rs 20,700 per month." The move is expected to cost an additional Rs 75 crore to the exchequer.
 
 The chief minister also said talked about a re-look on the contractual hiring of employees saying that it does not allow a person to settle down in life. 
 
 Several groups of contractual employees of different departments have been on a strike demanding pay revision and regularisation. With the assembly elections right around the corner, the state cannot ignore the demands of the agitating staff. The government gave into the demands of most of the groups - including the contractual teachers that have a strength of 2.84 lakhs.
 
 However, many other groups like aanganwadi workers, health workers have begun their agitation demanding pay hike and regularisation. The state government had made provisions for college guest faculty and aanganwadi workers in the 2018-19 budget, but it has failed to cut ice with the agitating employees, as the number of protestors keep on increasing.
 
 Presently, over 17,000 National   (NHM) workers across the state have been on a strike for the last 28 days impacting the immunisation programme and other health missions. 
 
 In addition, over a lakh of contract employees from various departments have threatened a joint strike on March 28 to press for their demand for regularisation.
 
 Amidst all this, chief minister obliquely advocating for abolition of contract system of jobs could come as a major source of solace for them.
