PATNA:   is likely to gain one seat in the legislative council election to be held for 11 seats in state on April 26, a party insider said on Saturday. The JD (U) and the BJP are likely to announce their candidates on Sunday. The last date for the filing of nomination papers by the candidates is April 16.

 The seats falling vacant include that of CM  , deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, former CM   and health minister Mangal Pandey. There is no confusion on Nitish, Modi and Pandey. Rabri and two others from her party have already filed their papers while the RJD has accommodated former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s son from its quota. As per their respective strength in the state assembly, four of the 11 seats would go to the RJD and one to the   in the grand alliance, leaving six seats in the BJP-led   kitty. One candidate needs 21 MLAs’ support to be elected as MLC.
 
 On their strength, JD (U) and BJP will have seven and 11 surplus votes after getting elected three and two nominees respectively. The NDA allies RLSP and LJP have two MLAs each and the BJP nominee will require only three surplus votes to win. 
 
 Against them, three seats would naturally go to the JD (U) and two to the BJP in the NDA camp. However, behind the scene pulls and pressures were being applied regarding the sixth seat in the NDA. Sources said the mystery as to the final claim over the sixth seat cleared on Saturday with the JD (U) politely backing off from its claim. Till now, the two parties and the Congress have not yet formally announced their nominees.
