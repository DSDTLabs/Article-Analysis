 and   have never confirmed their relationship, but news of their romance has been doing the rounds for quite some time now. But well, it seems like now this rumoured relationship has reached the quit point. The first speculations around their fondness for each other started around the time when they began shooting for ' '.

 Then on, the rumours grew only stronger, of course, neither of them or their families ever spoke about it. Last year, there was speculation that Shraddha had a big showdown with her family over living in with Farhan. However, in an interview with BT, Shraddha had quelled the rumour, saying, “Yes, I am living in... with my parents! I was born and brought up in this house. It's a joke within the family that I will bring my husband home (laughs). It's because I'm so happy living with my family.”
 
 Following that, it was believed that, Shraddha had moved back in with her dad and mother. When she unfollowed Farhan on Instagram in January 2018, people assumed it was a sign that things were over between the two. However, a few days later, when Shraddha wished Farhan on his birthday (January 9) on social media, it was natural to believe that all is well between the two. A few weeks later, it was also reported that Farhan and Shraddha were going to give their relationship another chance. 
 
 But our sources claim that the two have finally called it quits on their relationship. It was also reported a month ago that the two were slated to work together in a web series, which didn’t materialise because Shraddha didn’t have the required dates for the project. Whether this is merely a passing phase or the are two determined to move on, is something that we will have to wait and watch.
