Nagpur: Civic   Deepak Admane, who was carrying out beautification work of the Mahatma Gandhi statue premises at Juni Shukrawari, has been booked for causing death due to negligence by Kotwali   on Wednesday for the drowning of Siddhesh Shahu (4) in an open   on December 29 last year. 

 Senior PI Khusal Tijare of Kotwali police station said Admane has been put behind bars after the complaint against him was registered with the police. 
 
 Admane, who had taken up the project in November last year, is supposed to complete it by February. Rs 4.50 lakh was allotted for the work. The well, which was dug up to provide water for the fountain, was left uncovered when the work was temporarily discontinued and the site left unguarded. Also, no warning signboard was put up at the site even after that, thus risking the lives of the passersby and more so children who used to play nearby. 
 
 Siddhesh, only son of his parents, fell in the well while he was playing in the area. The friends, who too were playing with him, initially had refrained from raising any alarm. Kotwali police had initially registered a case of accidental death. PI Tijare said the investigating team procured documents, including tender papers and other documents related to the project. 
 
 “The negligence shown in not covering the well, not closing the access and not erecting a precautionary signboard at the site was the prime factor which resulted in the registration of offence,” he said.
