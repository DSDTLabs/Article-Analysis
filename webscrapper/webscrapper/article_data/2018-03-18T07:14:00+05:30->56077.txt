GURUGRAM: A woman living in Gurugram alleged on Saturday a   branch denied her money transferred by a friend abroad.   took to Twitter and uploaded a video, accusing officials at the branch of discrimination on the basis of religion.

 While the Western Union Twitter handle, responding to her tweet, promised a probe, the manager of the city branch refuted the charges and said the woman was offered a cheque which she refused to accept.
 
 In the video uploaded on Saturday, Martin claimed she had gone to the branch in Sector 10A to collect the money on Friday. The teller there asked her for an ID proof and enquired about her religion. “He then told me that the sender was a Hindu and I was a Christian, so I would not get the money,” she said in the video. “I was shocked. I had never been discriminated on the basis of (my) religion.” 
 
 “After being denied the money when I went to the next branch, I found that they had already blocked my transaction,” she told TOI.
 
 Meenakshi Pahwa, the manager of the branch, said it was part of procedure to check the relationship between the sender and the receiver. In this case, it was ‘unsubstantiated’. “So we offered her cheque (against the money transferred in her name). But, she didn’t accept it and behaved rudely,” she added.
