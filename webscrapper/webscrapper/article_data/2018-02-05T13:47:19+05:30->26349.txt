PANAJI: The state government is going to use Aadhaar to verify potential employees and even track the employment status of those who register with the state employment exchange. 

 The move is expected to provide a clear picture of the unemployment scenario in the state. It will also give authorities a clear idea about how many Goans are employed in the private and public sector, minister for revenue, information & technology and labour   said.
 
 “We expect to launch the Aadhaar system by end of February. Data filling has already started and connecting it with   will identify very clearly, Goans, non-Goans, skilled, unskilled, employed and unemployed,” Khaunte said.
 
 Officials of the ministry of labour and employment explained that there was a major challenge in collating accurate data on unemployment and job creation. Often the data available with the employment exchange and the data with the state department of labour and employment did not match. The list of persons registered with the employment exchange shows that some of the names are repeated.
 
 “Sometimes they have registered themselves as graduates, then   and registered themselves again. There are also people working in the private sector but looking for a government job,” Khaunte said.
 
 The government will collect data from the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), which has already linked Aadhaar to provident fund accounts so that data data of private sector employees can be captured. This will help the government identify if an applicant for a government job is already employed in the private sector. 
 
 Khaunte also hinted that the state government could introduce a financial assistance scheme for   in the state.
