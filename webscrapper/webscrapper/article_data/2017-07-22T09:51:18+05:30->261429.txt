AHMEDABAD: Four convicts of 2002   — Prakash Shezad Chara, Tiniya Mekda, Tiniya Shashikant Kadam and   — who are serving life-term for their role in the killings have jumped parole. Sources in the apex court-appointed special investigation team (SIT) said the convicts were granted parole by the jail authorities but they had not produced themselves within the specific time granted to them. Neither has the SIT received any written intimation from the jail authorities.

 It may be mentioned that earlier Mukesh Rathod, another convict of the   massacre case, had also jumped parole in December 2016. However, he was tracked down by the   (SOG) in January 2017 . SIT officials said that while the city police are searching for the absconding convicts, they too have launched an operation to arrest them. “We have informed our superiors about the incident and have activated our sources to nab them,” an SIT official. tnn
