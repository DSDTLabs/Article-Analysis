NEW DELHI: “Arunachal Pradesh is a  . People there can   better than in other northeastern states,” claimed   in an address to   students. 

 
 The   CM pointed out that several steps, including admissions of students from the Northeast into DU, had been taken in the past few years for integration of people from the northeastern states to other parts of the country. He added, “If you go to the villages there, people greet you with Namaste and Jai Hind”.
 
  DU had recently announced that it will include more students from the Northeast in the 2018-19 DU elections. The university’s admission committee had said that it will create a special cell for students from the Northeast and that each college will have a nodal officer during admissions. “The university will discuss the admission procedure with the resident commissioners from these states, who in turn will reach out to schools in the Northeast,” said Gurpreet Singh Tuteja, OSD UG admissions.
 
 At the Student’s Experience on Inter-Living event by ABVP, Khandu told students that he had studied in DU’s Hindu College at a time when not many knew about the states in the Northeast. “When I used to tell people that I am from Arunachal Pradesh, they used to get confused”. He praised the central government for its ‘Look East’ policy. In its 53rd year, the event, according to ABVP national media convener Saket Bahuguna, is an attempt at national integration. A delegation from the northeastern states will visit the mainland and live with a host family to connect with them better, he said. “In Delhi, they would be stationed in homes of teachers from DU, JNU and others. This will create a connection between people”.
