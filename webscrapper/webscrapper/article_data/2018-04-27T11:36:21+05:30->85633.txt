PANAJI: Olive Ridley turtles along Goa’s coast have been facing the impact of human activities. Earlier this week, the swirling waters of a storm surge may have caused damage to 10 nests in   and  .

 
 
  
  
 
 Ten nests on Canacona beaches were flooded for a couple of days. Forest officials are worried that seepage into the nests may have affected the breeding dynamics. “Most turtle nests at both sites have hatched, but seven in Agonda and three in Galgibaga were laid in recent weeks,” Vikramditya Gaonkar, range forest officer (wild life),  , said.
 
 Sand temperatures for nesting turtles are a vital factor and moist conditions may affect the hatching success. “These are amphibious reptiles that shuttle between the seas and shoreline, but they instinctly choose a supralittoral zone for egg-laying to avoid tidal flush. But with changing shore morphology, they are forced to chose a much lower inter-tidal zone,”  , a marine zoologist, said. “We will have to wait and see how the seepage affects the nests,” a forest official said.
