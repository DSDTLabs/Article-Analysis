PUNE: A 45-year-old farmer, his wife and their daughter were found murdered and their bodies concealed under a heap of garbage adjacent to a poultry farm near their house at   in Khed taluka, about 50km from here, on Tuesday.

 The Pune rural police exhumed the bodies of Rohidas Balu Gogavale, Manda (40) and Ankita (12). They were missing since Sunday. The police detained two persons, including Gogavale’s elder son from his first wife. Manda’s father,   (64), lodged a complaint with the Chakan police.
 
 Deputy superintendent of police (Pune rural) Ram Pathare told TOI that on Tuesday afternoon, a resident of Kurkundi village noticed a part of human body from the garbage heap and alerted the police.
 
  “Three of them were hacked to death and their bodies had started decomposing,” Pathare said. Gogavale was a farmer and owned a poultry farm in Kurkundi. “We suspect that the murder could be a fallout of some family dispute,” he said.
