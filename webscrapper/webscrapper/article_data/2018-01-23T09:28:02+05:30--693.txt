BHOPAL: Moving an interim application in   on Monday to recall its earlier order to lift the ban on screening of ‘Padmaavat’, the Madhya Pradesh government contended that under Section 6 of Cinematograph Act, it has the power to stop exhibition of any controversial movie on the grounds of possible law and order violation.

 The   government also moved an interim application in SC on similar lines. But while Rajasthan had formally banned screening of the film, Madhya Pradesh has not issued any notification announcing the ban.   and   are the other two states to have banned screening of the film.
 
 In MP, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had announced banning of the film, but no official notification was issued to this effect.
 
 A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice   posted the case for hearing on Tuesday.
 
 Advocate general of MP   moved the application. Senior lawyer Harish Salve represented producer of the film-Diacom 18.
