VARANASI: Reiterating his call for an out-of-court settlement of the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case, spiritual leader and founder of the Art of Living Foundation Sri Sri Ravi Shankar said on Tuesday that Muslims should gift the disputed land in   to Hindus for building a Ram temple. 

  Speaking at the ' ' organised here by his foundation, the spiritual guru said, "For a win-win situation, Muslims should gift the piece of land to the Hindus and withdraw all court cases. In return, Hindu saints should gift an equal area of land to the Muslims at a nearby location where they can construct a mosque. Such a settlement will lead to friendship between both the communities." 
 
  Though several religious leaders from across the country attended the Samagam, Muslim, Sikh and Christian invitees skipped the conclave. "This clearly shows that they do not consider themselves a part of this nation and are least interested to agree to any kind of settlement... There is no point in fighting, it is Ram Janmabhoomi. Sri Sri's intentions are undoubtedly positive," the chief priest of   temple, Santosh Das said. 
 
  Apart from Das, the other attendees included   chief priest Shrikant Mishra, mahant of Sankat Mochan Temple Vishambharnath Mishra, Mahant of   Rameshwar Puri, the vice-chancellor of Sampurnanand Sanskrit Prof Yadunath Dwivedi and Dandi Swamis. 
 
  Sri Sri also inaugurated the 'Om Anugrah Rail Yatra', a spiritual train journey from Varanasi, which would pass through the towns and villages in Uttar Pradesh, along with 900 devotees.
