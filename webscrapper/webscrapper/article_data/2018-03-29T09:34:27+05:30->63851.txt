PUNE: A special court here on Wednesday ordered the discharge of Virendra Mhaiskar, the chairman and managing director of   Infrastructure Developers Limited (IIDL), and three others from a case of criminal conspiracy and attempt to cheat the state by grabbing massive tracts of government land at Pimpaloli village along the Pune-Mumbai Expressway for a proposed integrated township project. 

 Deepak Gadgil, the chief executive officer of IRB company, and two corporate entities — IIDL and its subsidiary as well as real estate development arm, Aryan Infrastructure Investments Private Limited (AIIPL) — are the three others discharged from the case by special judge A K Patil.
 
 The case was initiated in 2009 by   activist Satish Shetty. He was murdered in January 2010.
 
 The fate of the remaining 13 accused hinges on the individual roles attributed to them by the   ( ) and the view to be taken by the court. “Some of the remaining accused have moved their discharge pleas,” Mhaiskar’s lawyer, Shrikant Shivade, told TOI.
 
 Later, in a disclosure statement filed with the   and the National Stock Exchange, IIDL’s company secretary Mehul Patel said, “The learned judge in his order today (on Wednesday) observed that no case is made out even to frame the charges under any of the sections alleged by the CBI.”
 
 The special court’s order was not uploaded on the district court’s site till Wednesday evening.
 
 On December 6, the CBI had filed a chargesheet against Mhaiskar and 17 others, including then sub-registrars of Lonavala and Maval talukas in Pune district and a lawyer, for criminal conspiracy and attempt to cheat. The same day, Mhaiskar and 11 others appeared before the special judge, who ordered their release on bail.
 
 Shetty’s brother, Sandeep, who has been pursuing the matter after the RTI activist’s murder, said, “It was evident from the CBI’s chargesheet that the case against the prime accused was weak. I shall keep on fighting for the cause.”
