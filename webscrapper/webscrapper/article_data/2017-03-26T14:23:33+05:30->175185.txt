NEW DELHI:   has become an overnight star after his sensational debut in Dharamsala where he picked 4/68 to limit Australia's first innings tally to 300 on Saturday.

 And the left-arm Chinaman credited legendary Australian legspinner, his childhood idol,   for the impressive performance. 
 
 "If you see the first wicket, it was not a chinaman, it was a flipper that I have learnt from Warne," Kuldeep said on Saturday.
 
 In response, Warne has praised the 22-year-old Indian saying he is always open to offer his expertise to any spinner belonging to any country and hopes for a better future for wrist spinners. 
 
  
  
 
 Kuldeep said he still watches Warne's bowling videos to learn the nuances of spin bowling and revealed that the 47-year-old has promised to hold a training session with him in future.
  
 "It's fun to learn it from him and then dismiss batsmen from his own country. Warne is my idol and I have followed him since childhood, even now I watch his videos. It was a dream come true when I first met and talked to him. I have continued to follow his advice. Now he has promised me to meet again and hold a training session with me," Kuldeep said.
 
 Kuldeep stunned Australia with three quick scalps in the second session on the opening day of the fourth and final Test being underway in Dharamsala. His victims included  , Peter Handscomb,   and Pat Cummins.
