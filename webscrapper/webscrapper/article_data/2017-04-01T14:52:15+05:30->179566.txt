Taapsee Pannu-starrer ‘Naam Shabana’, which hit theatres on Friday (March 31), collected approximately Rs 4.75 crore (nett) on its opening day, according to a report on Boxofficeindia.com. 
 
 The producers released their figures, which quoted that the film earned Rs 5.12 crore on day one. 
 
 The action spy thriller is a spin-off of the 2015 hit ‘Baby’. The 2015 Neeraj Pandey-directed film saw   playing the central role, while Taapsee’s role was relatively shorter but pivotal to the story. It was the audience’s interest in her character that sparked off the inception of the prequel. Now, ‘Naam Shabana’ delves into the backstory of Taapsee’s character Shabana Khan and shows the audience how she is trained to become a spy. Akshay can be seen in an extended cameo in the Shivam Nair-directed film. The movie also stars Manoj Bajpayee as Shabana’s mentor,   as Akshay’s aide and Prithviraj Sukumaran as the antagonist. 
  
  
  
 Taapsee has received appreciation from all quarters for her powerful performance as a spy. The actress had to train in mixed martial arts, Kudo and Krav Maga in order to pull off the role convincingly.
