Shivamogga: A day after the Dalit protests and the subsequent loss of lives shook the nation, AICC president   on Tuesday questioned PM Narendra Modi on his silence over the dilution of the scheduled caste and scheduled tribes atrocities act.

 “When there is a clear threat to the lives of the weaker section of the society, their exploitation continuing across the nation, the fear of the SC/ST atrocities act being diluted is palpable. There is large scale opposition against the dilution of the act, and yet, Modi remains silent,” Rahul said.
 
 Expressing his condolences towards the loss of life in the Dalits agitations which saw the death of 11 people across parts of north India, Rahul charged Modi with making “false promises” of removing disparity in the society and providing equal opportunity to all. “But instead, he is allowing the rich to become even richer and escape from the country and continues to remain silent on the matter. Perhaps, he believes that silence is the best way of ruling this country,” he said with sarcasm.
 
 Rahul also attacked Modi for his silence on the “incomparable” corruption which took place under the BJP reign of Karnataka in 2008. “I believe that the BJP national president Amit Shah’s statement of Karnataka achieving the number one position in corruption under B S Yeddyurappa was not a slip of tongue but a fact,” he said.
 
 Earlier in the day, Rahul met the Kanaka Gurupeetha pontiff Sri Niranjanananda Puri swamiji at Belludi near Harihar. He took the blessing of the pontiff and was felicitated with a black Kambali (woolen blanket), percieved to be a good omen of victory ahead of the elections.
 
 Along the route, he held a road show in Malebennur and greeted party workers along the way.
