Vadodara: An auto parts shop owner living in Warasia was allegedly threatened by his friend, sister and brother-in-law of a history-sheeter Anil Gangwani alias Anthony. A case of extortion and criminal intimidation was registered against Sanjay Nawani, Mahesh Bhojwani and his wife, who also claimed to be Anthony’s wife, Rakesh Bhojwani and Jitu Rohida at Warasia police station on Saturday. Complainant Ashok Wadhwani told the police that Vicky Ahuja, who had his garments shop beside Wadhwani’s old shop at Bajwada, had borrowed Rs one lakh at 3% interest from his childhood friend Sanjay Nawani around three years back. Wadhwani had agreed to be Ahuja’s guarantor. But, after Wadhwani sold his Bajwada shop four months back, he lost contact with Ahuja. On April 12, Nawani came to Wadhwani’s shop along with Bhojwani and his wife. According to Wadhwani’s complaint, Nawani told Wadhwani that Ahuja has fled with his money and since he had agreed to be his guarantor, Wadhwani will have to give Rs 15 lakh to him. When Wadhwani denied, Bhojwani and his wife allegedly threatened him by saying that they are Anthony’s sister and brother-in-law and have taken up responsibility of extorting money from him, cops said. They also told Wadhwani that they will abduct his sons and kill them, if he will not return money. Wadhwani then call police control room and later went to Warasia police station with complaint against the trio. Police said that at the police station with intervention of members of their community, they reached at a settlement. Nawani agreed to take Rs 1 lakh from Wadhwani within a week. However, the trio and Rakesh again went to his shop on next day and threatened Wadhwani, following which he filed complaint.
