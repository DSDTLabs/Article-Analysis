HYDERABAD: The   has dismissed a plea by an   who contended that   enhancement GO was applicable to employees in  .

 The amendment brought out by the Andhra Pradesh government to the AP Public Employment Act, 1984, increasing the age of superannuation of its employees from 58 to 60 years will not be applicable to their counterparts in Telangana, the bench comprising acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Shameem Akhter said while dismissing the petition of the additional SP of Telangana. The AP government on June 27, 2014 amended the Act increasing the age of superannuation. M Sarveshwar Reddy , an additional superintendent of police, moved the petition urging the court to direct the Telangana government to extend the benefit of extension of age of superannuation as the Act of 1984 was adopted by the Telangana government under Section 101 of the AP Reorganisation Act 2014. 
 
 Vedula Srinivas, the counsel appearing for the petitioner, contended that since AP amended the Act of 1984 with retrospective effect from June 2, 2014 and as the Act 1984 was adopted by the Telangana government, it would apply to Telangana also, and consequently all government servants working in Telangana are entitled to be continued till they attain the age of 60 years.
