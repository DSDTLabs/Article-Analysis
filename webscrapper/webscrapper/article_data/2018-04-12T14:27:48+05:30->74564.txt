LUDHIANA: Obscene pictures of a   leader from Dugri, advocate  , with a foreigner have gone viral on social media. Sheela’s wife   is a Congress councillor from ward 43.

 Ever since Wednesday morning, the photos were being circulated on various WhatsApp groups along with a graphic message, taking dig at Capt Amarinder Singh and the Congress. The messages show Sheela’s obscene photos and also his old pictures with Amarinder and former Union minister  . The message says, “Mainu maan hai ki Congress party da harek neta mere dikhaye raste te chal reha hai: Captain (I am proud that every leader of the Congress party is walking on the path shown by me: Captain).”
 
 The opposition has been ridiculing Sheela since morning. Besides, Congress leaders are demanding that Sheela be sacked for causing embarrassment to the party.
 
 However, terming it a conspiracy of his opponents, Sheela claimed that these were morphed pictures circulated with the intention of ending his political career. He also filed a complaint with the deputy commissioner of police, demanding an FIR against the propagators of photographs.
 
 Speaking to the TOI, Sheela said, “These morphed pictures are an attempt by my opponents to end my political career and defame me and my family. They have even sent audio messages to people known to me, in which they have used derogatory remarks against me and my wife and also threatened me.”
 
 When asked if it could be the handiwork of someone from his own party, Sheela said, “Since I have filed a police complaint and investigation is under way, I will not comment. Once FIR is lodged, everything will be out in the open and culprits will be behind bars.”
 
 Slamming the Congress, BJP district president Ravinder Arora said, “The Congress owes an apology to the people of Punjab for encouraging such elements.”
 
 Ludhiana DCP (crime) Gagan Ajit Singh confirmed receiving the complaint from Sheela. “The probe has been marked to the ACP (investigation),” said the DCP.
