PUNE: Brace for traffic diversions on   as Maha   Rail Corporation on Thursday said the foundation work of the project along the 1.7km stretch on the street will continue for at least a year. 

 The work is expected to begin in February from Paud Phata and will continue till Garware high school near Deccan Gymkhana.   officials said plans were afoot to complete the foundation work within a year since its commencement. Other work related to construction of piers and installation of segments will be taken up once the foundations are ready.
 
 As per the plan, the Metro rail will travel from Paud Phata, SNDT and then towards Deccan Gymkahana. The tracks will proceed along the river near Yeshvantrao Chavan bridge. The Metro line is aligned on the road median and the work will be taken up in phases. Traffic diversions are proposed on Karve Road to facilitate the work. 
 
 On Wednesday, a survey was conducted jointly by the elected representatives from the   (PMC), traffic police and Maha Metro officials to chalk out a traffic management plan. The traffic police have told the civic authorities to reduce the width of footpaths, remove dividers at some stretches and shift the PMPML bus stops. The traffic police also plan to impose no-parking and no-halting rules on both sides of the road. 
 
 The changes in the traffic rules are likely to come into force in the next two weeks following necessary changes. The traffic police will conduct a review of the arrangements after two weeks.
 
 The officials said since the work was likely to start in phases, they would consult the civic authorities and traffic police as and when required. 
 
 Maha Metro is also planning to set up parking lots near Paud Phata to provide connectivity for Metro users to park their vehicles.
