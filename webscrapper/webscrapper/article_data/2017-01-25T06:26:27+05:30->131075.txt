AMRITSAR: Election Commission and Punjab Police have initiated a probe into a complaint by AAP against a forged letter, which carries the signatures of its spokesperson Sanjay Singh and asks   to reduce his rallies in the state. 

 AAP has told the EC that the letter was forged to "jeopardise free and fair elections" in Punjab. "Through media circulation, a letter written by Sanjay Singh, our Punjab prabhari, and addressed to our national convener has come to our notice which has been found to be a forged," the complaint says
 
  "Appending photocopy of letter, we request you to refer the matter to the DGP Punjab to get the matter investigated and a case registered under provisions of IPC," it adds.
 
 Sources in   said cops were probing the complaint. Earlier in the day, a war of words broke out between the   and AAP over the letter. Allegedly written by Sanjay Singh, the letter 'suggests' Kejriwal to bring down his public appearances at rallies in Punjab in wake of unfavourable findings in an internal AAP survey. Sanjay posted a picture of his passport signature on Twitter to point out that his signatures did not match. He said in the Tweet that the "dirty tricks department" of Congress campaign strategist   was behind it.
 
 Kishor's team retorted by pointing out that the passport picture posted by Singh itself was fake as it showed one-year validity. The letter read, "As you know, the internal survey on the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab has not been in our favour... In view of this, my suggestion is that your rallies should be slowly declared and local leaders be brought to the forefront."
 
 In the evening, a photo of an email allegedly written by Kishor to   also started doing rounds on social media. It has almost similar content as the later.
