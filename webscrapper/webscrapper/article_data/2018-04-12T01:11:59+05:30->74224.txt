MUMBAI: The   on Wednesday quashed the CBI’s case against prominent builder   related to alleged   (PF) dues amounting to Rs 9 crore. 

 A division bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice Makarand Karnik said the action of the enforcement agencies in initiating criminal prosecution against the   was “impermissible”.
 
 The CBI’s anti-corruption bureau had filed the FIR in 2008 and the chargesheet in 2010. Hiranandani was accused of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy. 
 
 “Looking to the fact that Hiranandani is being prosecuted in a case revolving around non-payment of PF dues without any inquiry being conducted under Section 7-A of the Employee Provident Fund Act, we are of the opinion that it amounts to an abuse of the process of the court,” said the bench. “Such a prosecution cannot be allowed to continue. The case is also such that chances of conviction are bleak and no useful purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue,” said the bench and quashed the FIR.
 
 The court said under the law, an inquiry has to be conducted to determine the amount payable, which was not done in this case. Moreover, the dues did not even relate to Hiranandani Properties Private Ltd, but contractors engaged by the company. If the contractors failed to pay, only then would the company be asked to pay. Prosecution could have been launched only if the company refused to pay the dues, the court said.
