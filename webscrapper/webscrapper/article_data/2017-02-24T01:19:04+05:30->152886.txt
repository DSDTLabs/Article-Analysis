Lucknow: Crowds will not be deprived of ‘darshan’ as even in a queue they will be viewing the sanctum sanctorum on LED screens at temples in the city on the occasion of   on Friday. Most of the temples will screen puja ceremony live on LED walls placed outside the premises, while some have even made arrangements   of the event, giving devotees a chance to view all rituals on   from anywhere.

 High priest of Mankameshwar temple Mahant Devyagiri said the arrangement have been made especially for people standing in long queues. “From midnight, devotees start gathering outside the temple but not everybody gets a chance to see properly what is going on inside the main enclosure, so with the arrangement made, while they wait for their turn, they can watch rituals like ‘Rudrabhisekh’, ‘shringar’ and ‘maha-aarti’ on the giant screen outside the temple.”
 
 Rajendranagar Shiva temple trustee Atul Mishra said they had recently invested Rs 35 Lakh for overall renovation and installation of of LED screens on the temple premises was part of the project. “As many as five screens are mounted so that people standing in all corners can see the activities going on inside the sanctum.”
 
 Arrangements for special online screening have also been made for the first time at Ranjendranagar Shiv temple, this year. People may watch all rituals as they take place by logging in to www.mahashivmandir.com.
 
 In several other temples including the one in Sadar and the Shivala in Old City, Led screens are being installed on the premises. 
 
 Sadar temple priest Roop Narayan said, “We have decided to put up LED screens because there is a big crowd on festivals and visitors hardly get a few seconds to go inside the sanctum and with this arrangement, they can at least look at the deity as much as they want. And click pictures too.”
