HYDERABAD:   chief official spokesperson   on Saturday said that the decision of chief minister   to extend Rs 4,000 per acre sop to only those farmers owning agriculture land will leave behind nearly 15 lakh   farmers and their families, which is about 60 lakh people at the rate of four persons per family on an average.

 “If you give Rs 4,000 per acre to only farmers who own agriculture land, do you think they would pass on this government sop or even share it with tenant farmers who actually bear the brunt of the vagaries of monsoon? You should know that a majority of the over 4,000 farmers who committed suicide were tenant farmers,” he said.
