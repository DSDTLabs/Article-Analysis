GUWAHATI: Veteran actor   has urged chief minister   to enact a   in  . Recently, at least two Assamese films were taken off theatres to make way for big-budget Hindi movies. 

 "I'm a person who believes in rules. I think Sarba (chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal) is a good man and he should make a rule. If he wants a cultural awakening, he should make it compulsory for cinemas to screen local films so that Assamese movies can be promoted and preserved," said Banerjee, who has acted in several Assamese films. 
 
 The sequel of Assamese cult movie 'Local Kung Fu' (LKF), which was released on April 19, had to make way for 'Baahubali-2'. A few months ago, Himangshu Prasad Das's 'Shakira Aahibo Bakul Tolor Bihuloi' was taken off theatres to accommodate Shahrukh Khan's 'Raaes' and Hritik Roshan starrer 'Kaabil'. This prompted Himangshu to seek help from Ulfa leader Paresh Baruah. 
 
 Banerjee said Assam filmmakers have been doing excellent work at the national level. He also praised Arman Ahmed and Deep Choudhury, the producer and director of 'Alifa', which won the best debut director honour at the national awards this year. 
 
 "So many people in Assam are doing good work. So, the government must take some steps in this regard. Make it compulsory that at least four weeks in a year the theatres have to screen local films and let them choose the time. That's how you have to encourage the industry," said Banerjee, who recently finished shooting for another Assamese film, 'Xhoixobote Dhemalite', by Bidyut Kotoky.
 
 Kenny Basumatary, the director of LKF2 which got an overwhelming response, expressed shock at the treatment meted out to him. 
 
 "Is this the way these theatre owners treat local cinema? If it continues like this, why should I make Assamese films here?" he added.
