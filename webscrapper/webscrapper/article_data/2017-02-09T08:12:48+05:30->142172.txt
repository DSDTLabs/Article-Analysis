JAIPUR: Rajasthan High Court said that the   has no competence to enact rules governing the functioning the various district bar associations in the state and constituted a committee under state advocate general N M Lodha to recommend guidelines for various bar associations.

 The court said the secretary of the   of Rajasthan would act as the secretary of the 11-member committee. The committee has to make the recommendations by March 20.
 
 The division bench of   and   gave the order on a petition by various district bar associations challenging the Rule issued by the Bar Council of Rajasthan in 2013. 
 
 The court observed there is no doubt about anxiety of Bar Council to have matured and responsible Bar Associations with mature leadership, but this pious object is not supposed to be achieved by imposing rules without having jurisdiction.
 
 It said “the Bar Council is under statutory obligation to have orientation, refresher and training courses for Advocates. The Council is also required to have all necessary measures to enrich academic and professional standards of the Advocates. Much activity in these fields is required to be taken instead of travelling beyond the authority vested.” 
 
 It further expressed its displeasure about casual attitude adopted by the Bar Council even in enacting rules, if had any authority. It said the complete set of Rules is full of grammatical errors including the errors of expression while striking down the rules. 
 
 Court however said it is aware with the need of having necessary guidelines/norms to strengthen the Bar Associations, more specifically the legal profession, members of which are part of Bar Associations, therefore, the Court while exercising powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, deems it appropriate to extend certain norms and guidelines in tune with the directions given by the Apex Court.
