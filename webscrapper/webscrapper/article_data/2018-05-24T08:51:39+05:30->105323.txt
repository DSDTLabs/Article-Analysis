 Speaking to reporters at Chengannur on Wednesday, the veteran Congress leader said that the Congress- JD(S) coalition in Karnataka is just a stepping stone in this regard.
 
 “The   should also cooperate with the Congress in the move against BJP at national-level. But the politics in Kerala is entirely different,” he said.
 
 Antony was in Chengannur on Wednesday for attending the campaign programme of UDF candidate D Vijayakumar. The former defense minister said that the CPM can only verbally challenge the BJP.
 
 “CPM candidates tasted failure in Karnataka, Gujarat, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh polls. In many assembly constituencies, CPM candidates were even behind NOTA votes. All the CPM candidates, who contested in Delhi, lost even the cash they put in for contesting in the bypoll. The party was thrown out of power in Tripura. They are finding it difficult to make a headway in West Bengal. The condition of CPM is very pathetic in all the states. So how can they fight the BJP? CPM has now become the communist party of Kerala,’’ said Antony.
 
 He further said: “Only Congress can lead a fight against the BJP.”
 
 Meanwhile, BJP district president K Soman said that though defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman had agreed to address a women's meet at Chengannur on Wednesday as part of the election campaigh of   candidate P S Sreedharan Pillai, she had to cancel the programme following cabinet meeting.
