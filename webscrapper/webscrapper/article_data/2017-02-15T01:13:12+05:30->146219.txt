MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation on Tuesday informed the   it will ‘peacefully’ vacate its   located inside Jawaharlal Nehru Garden at   barracks near Mantralaya. The agency also moved court seeking time to hand over possession of its office by October 31, saying it is still in talks to shift to another location nearby. 

 On March 2, 2016, the HC, after hearing PILs by resident associations, came down heavily on BJP headquarters and state agencies, including  , for encroaching on the recreation garden. It had then directed the BMC to take action against contravening structures.
 
 On Tuesday, senior advocate S M Gorwadkar, appearing for MTDC, informed a division bench of Justice V M Kanade and Justice P R Bora that the agency recently received a final demolition notice from the BMC, but it needs time as talks are on to move into another office. “There are 10 proposals from various premises,” said Gorwadkar, adding that the World Trade Centre was almost finalized, but following allegations of “some things hanky-panky”, the process was stopped. Gorwadkar also informed HC that three alternative sites were zeroed in—Bajaj Bhavan, Apeejay House and G T Hospital. 
 
 Senior advocate Mustafa Doctor, appearing for petitioners, said if MTDC is giving an undertaking that it will vacate the premises, it will suffice. “We want the garden back,” he added. 
 
 Asking how much time would MTDC need to move out, Justice Kanade said, “It shouldn’t happen that you say six months and then seek an extension.” The HC gave MTDC four weeks’ time to inform if it has entered into any agreement for another office space and directed it to give a proper undertaking at the next hearing on March 21. “Then we’ll consider how much time should be granted. We hope the state takes a decision as quickly as possible,” the judges said.
