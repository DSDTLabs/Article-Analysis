Trichy: Preparations for the third cycle of accreditation to Bharathidasan University from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) have been put on fast track. Newly-appointed vice-chancellor P Manishankar said he would visit each department to monitor the progress of work starting Thursday.

 Accreditation to the Bharathidasan University (BDU) with ‘A’ Grade by NAAC had expired in September last year. A steering committee will look after the entire accreditation process in the third cycle that will be for a period of five years. The internal quality assurance cell (IQAC) started preparations based on the new set of guidelines from September last year. However, the process slowed down in the absence of the vice-chancellor.
 
 Saying that a format on the required data had already been sent to each department, Manishankar said, “Data has to be collected under seven major criteria from all the departments which have to be submitted to NAAC online. The main idea is to assess the ground reality in each department which would help us in planning,” he said.
 
 As per the new guidelines, the last five year’s data pertaining to the performance of the university has been sought. Since it has to be submitted mostly in numeric and tabular form, it has to be filed online as part of the assessment. Institutions and universities can apply for NAAC assessment only twice a year, either in October-November or May-June.
 
 Director of internal quality assurance cell (IQAC), S Rajasekar said, “We are speeding up the process to try and apply in the next cycle itself which falls in April/May. While scoring above three in the four point scale is our target, NAAC accreditation becomes crucial to claim strategic funding from the University Grants Commission (UGC),” he said.
