GURUGRAM: As summer peaks, the   (NICU) of   finds itself in the grip of a crisis with six of its nine air-conditioners not functioning. Besides temperatures in the ward, meant for newborn babies, going up, this has also affected   there. 

 An NICU specialises in care for ill or premature newborn infants. The one at General Hospital has 24 beds, and there are 16 to 18 babies admitted here on any given day. 
 
 Ward-in-charge Dr M P Sharma, a paediatrician at the hospital, said on Saturday the most suitable room temperature for newborns is around 24 to 25 degrees Celsius. Any major variation can lead to the babies developing problems like pneumonia or diarrhoea.
 
 According to hospital sources, most air-conditioners in NICU have not been functioning for over a year and, in fact, developed snarls within a month of annual servicing. The situation turned worse on Thursday when one of the functional ACs in the ward also stopped working. 
 
 The hospital administration moved quickly and quickly bought and installed a new one, averting a bigger crisis.
 
 A senior official of the hospital administration blamed tyhe situation on the absence of an established maintenance wing in the hospital and engineering staff. It has issued a tender for awarding a maintenance contract with a promised payment of Rs 5.5 lakh, out of which Rs 1.5 lakh has been set aside only for the NICU.
 
 “The airconditioners at the hospital have not been functioning properly since last summer. Now, we are planning to hire a maintenance firm to service and repair all the AC units in the hospital. Plus, regular maintenance will be provided from now on,” said Dr Sharma.
 
 Last week, chief medical officer Dr Kanta Goyal had pulled up the administration of the General Hospital in Sohna for poor management of the institution. Dr Goyal did not reply to calls on Saturday for a comment on the NICU of the Civil Lines hospital.
