JAIPUR: The government may not have found a way to fix the simple call drop problem, but its enthusiasm and optimism in leapfrogging into a  , powered by over a billion mobile phones and Aadhaar enrolments, show no sign of waning.

 Speaking at a   ( ) session on Digital Economy on Saturday, Amitabh Kant, chief executive officer of  , said mobile telephony and the biometric data captured through Aadhaar would make all credit and debit cards irrelevant by 2020.
 
 He said that currently 95% of personal consumption and 85% of all transactions were done through cash. “We have grown up in a cash-based economy. There needs to be behavioural change to migrate to a less-cash economy to check corruption. Now, we have an interoperable backend infrastructure called the Unified Payment Interface (UPI). One just needs a mobile phone and Aadhaar number to do any kind of transaction,” added Kant.
 
 To facilitate digital transactions, Prime Minister   had recently launched the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) application. While it has seen over a crore if downloads, the application has attracted criticism for its unfriendly user experience.
 
 But Aruna Sundarajan, Union secretary of the ministry of electronics & information technology (MeitY), said that constant improvements were being done on the app to make it simpler.
 
 Besides, Sundarajan said that the BHIM app would be available in nine more Indian languages by the first week of February to enhance its accessibility and usage.
 
 “Apart from making BHIM available in local languages, we are also working on incorporating Aadhaar into the app so as to enable making payments by just using a thumb print. There are already cheaper thumb print scanners used by telcos for e-KYC verification. Moreover, mobile phone manufacturers like Samsung have already rolled out devices that can read thumb prints,” said Sundarajan.
