AHMEDABAD: The Dalit medical student from Tamilnadu, Dr M Mariraj, who attempted suicide alleging caste discrimination, took his second-year post-graduation examination on Wednesday afternoon as   high court directed   to allow him to sit in exams a couple of hours before the test began.

 A single-judge bench on Tuesday rejected Mariraj’s petition seeking direction to GU to permit him to take exams. He was informed that he could not sit the exams at the last moment on the ground that he did not submit his dissertation in time, he did not have adequate attendance and he did not present his paper, prepare poster card and article that were required to qualify to appear in final test. The single-judge observed that GU vice-chancellor does not have power to pardon the delay in such matters.
 
 Mariraj immediately filed an appeal before the division bench without having the copy of the order. During the hearing on Wednesday, the bench of Chief Justice R S Reddy and Justice V M Pancholi provided the copy of the order to Mariraj’s advocate Anand Yagnik.
 
 Advocate Yagnik submitted that Mariraj has been a victim of discrimination and hence is being denied the opportunity of appearing in the exams. He has been targeted also because he filed a complaint against the faculty members for creating circumstances which led him to attempt suicide on January 5. He claimed that Mariraj had made all requisite submissions well within time.
 
 The petitioner also highlighted how the university delayed the deadline for submission of dissertation from December 1 to February 1 without seeking permission from the Medical Council of India.
 
 When HC’s division bench ordered GU to permit Mariraj to appear in exams, GU’s counsel kept opposing the decision by reiterating that this was against the rules and regulations.
 
 The high court has permitted the student to take exams on condition that he would not claim equity and his result would be subject to the outcome of the appeal.
