AMBALA: Former chief parliamentary secretary (CPS) Rao Dan Singh, who is also former president of the   (HFA), and other two former members of the sports body have been booked on cheating and forgery charges. Besides Rao Dan, HFA’s former secretary Sunil Bhardwaj and former treasurer   have also been named in the alleged cheating and forgery case at Parao police station in Ambala Cantonment.

 The case was registered on the complaint of HFA’s current secretary Rohit Choudhary, who hails from Ambala. He claimed that the organization was restructured and new office-bearers joined after the state football body polls in December 2016. “They have been accused of using the letterhead of the state football association for different purposes when they are not authorized to do that since they have no concern with the organization now,” a police official investigating the matter said.
 
 Rao Dan, who spoke to TOI from   on phone, said, “The case against me is politically-motivated. There is no doubt that the case was registered in such a hasty manner over a non-issue. I’ve been asked to continue as the president of HFA by the   (AIFF) through a letter in July 2016.”
