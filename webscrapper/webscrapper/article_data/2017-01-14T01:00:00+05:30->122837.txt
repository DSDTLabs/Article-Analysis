 will host Vipul D Shah’s reality show, 'Rising Star'. What’s interesting about this is the connection Meiyang has with one of the celeb judges on the show —  . The two were dating in the past. Incidentally, both shot to fame as contestants of music reality show, Indian Idol. Says Monali, “It’s been five years since we parted ways, but we remain good friends. All reports of discord between us are baseless. In fact, he informed me that he will be hosting the show and we had a hearty laugh over it.”

 Monali is unfazed by the fact that their past could be raked up on the show. She says, “I am a funny person, who knows how to laugh at herself. If that happens, we will take it in a positive manner. We are today’s generation and are cool about such things."
