Mumbai: Former railway minister  , who relinquished the portfolio early this month, has blamed the very   he was heading for the stampede at Elphinstone Road station. In a press statement issued on Friday evening, Prabhu said he had sanctioned a wider   ( ) at Elphinstone Road station in 2015. The tender was not issued on account of the railway administration’s careless attitude, he claimed.

 But in a February 20, 2016, letter to Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant, Prabhu said: “The needs and aspirations of the people are brought to our notice through various requests and representations sent by you as a Member of Parliament. Most of the requests which are received reflect the genuine needs and demands of the people and it is always our endeavour to agree to as many requests as possible. However, sometimes due to the paucity of finances, operational constraints or other compelling circumstances agreeing to the request may not be possible.”
 
 The letter further said: “It has been one of the toughest years for the Indian   because of the adverse effects of the global slowdown. Even in these challenging times, the following railway works in your constituency is under our positive consideration: Elphinstone Road construction of 12 m wide new FOB connecting Western Railway and Central Railway after extension of Platform No. 1&2 towards North side by 100 metres.”
 
 Now, on Friday, Prabhu said: “Had the administration cleared the proposal (for FOB) in time, issued the tender and appointed a contractor, this incident would not have happened and innocent lives would not have been lost. The lackadaisical working of the railway administration is responsible for the tragedy.” The statement was issued by Prabhu’s personal assistant Harish Prabhu.
 
 The statement said that on April 23, 2015, Prabhu had sanctioned Rs 11.86 crore for the construction of a 12m-wide and 10m-long FOB for the station.
