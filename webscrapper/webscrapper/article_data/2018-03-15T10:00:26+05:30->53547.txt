KOTTAYAM:  , wife of Lok Sabha member   and daughter-in-law of KC (M) chairman   has joined the ‘Me Too’ bandwagon, saying she was harassed aboard a moving train by a politician’s son.

 The recent #MeToo movement, mostly by women, had exposed the enormity of sexual assault across the world.
 
 In her yet-to-be-published memoir, ‘The Other Side of This Life’, Nisha said her tormentor was on his way to visit his father-in-law, hospitalized after an accident. She, however, did not reveal the man’s identity or when the incident occurred.
 
 Nisha said on realizing his intention, “I hinted that I was very sleepy. But he paid no heed. I discreetly went to the TTE and requested him to help me. The TTE said: if this gentleman is anything like his father, I dare not intervene,” she wrote.
 
 The woman said she pulled up her legs and sat hugging the knees. “Occasionally his hand would ‘accidentally’ brush my toes as he shifted position. I felt violated. He had crossed the  . I firmly asked him to leave, Nisha wrote, adding that she made “no mention of his impropriety.”
 
 It is not known if Nisha told her father-in-law or husband about the incident, and if a police complaint was lodged.
 
 The book also speaks about those who had levelled personal allegations against Jose Mani and K M Mani, though no names are mentioned. Instead, she has used “Our hero”, “neighbour enemy”, “someone”, etc. The book also mentions the bar bribery and solar scams.
 
 “My children don’t face teenage problems but have political problems,” she wrote, recalling how her children were confronted by their peers on the bar bribery and solar scandals.
 
 Nisha said K M Mani used to pacify her when allegations were levelled against them. 
 
 “Only he knows why he is barking. Let him bark. The louder the dogs bark the less a lion feels threatened,” she wrote, quoting ‘Achachan.’
