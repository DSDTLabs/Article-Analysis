NEW DELHI: With   turning the heat on   in north Delhi, a   enrolled in these centres have approached the court.

 These students, preparing for various competitive exams, have urged HC to hear their application as any court decision in this regard would affect their future.
 
 The students, studying at various coaching centres in Outram Lines, Kingsway Camp and   in north Delhi, filed an application before a bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar, which is hearing a PIL seeking to shut down these centres operating in residential areas.
 
 The bench is likely to hear the plea on October 9 when the main petition against the running of coaching centres from residential properties is listed for hearing.
 
 In their application to the court, five students have submitted that they have already deposited full fees to the coaching centres and if any of them is shut down or sealed, they will suffer. 
 
 “The applicants are at the most crucial stage of their life where their future will depend on their performance in the competitive exams and any hindrance and wastage of time will leave them behind, spoiling their future,” the plea said, adding that in a recent incident some of their friends were thrown out after the coaching centre was sealed.
 
 In the main PIL, HC had asked for responses from north corporation and Delhi Police after the petitioner submitted that coaching centres are running illegally resulting in overcrowding and causing “grave nuisance to the bonafide residents.”
 
 This had prompted HC to observe that the capital “will breathe” easier if it stayed all such conversion of residential property for commercial use without adhering to the master plan requirements.
 
 It had earlier said that people, using residential properties for commercial use, have become “selfish” as they were earning profits without thinking of the inconvenience they are causing to their neighbours.
