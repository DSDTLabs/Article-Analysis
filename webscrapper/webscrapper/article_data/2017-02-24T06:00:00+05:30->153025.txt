VISAKHAPATNAM: Farmers at Mudapaka complained to collector Pravin Kumar that a person with political influence has occupied their lands and constructed a seven-kilometre road overnight. 

 Farmers alleged that  , owner of Jalavihar in Hyderabad, connived with the village sarpanch’s husband Siyyadri   and his brother Ramana to gain original pattas, title deeds and their signatures on white papers. 
 
 According to sources, they took possession of more than 500 acres of land and denied access to the farmers. 
 
 Around 30 farmers of Mudapaka, Govindapuram, Boddunaidupalem and Ramapuram villages in Pendurthi mandal met the collector on Tuesday. “They told us that government has taken the assigned lands allotted to us in land pooling. They approached us in October 2016 and pressured us to sell our lands to them as Ramaraju has got the permission from the government. They threatened us,” a farmer of Mudapaka P Appa Rao said. He said Ramaraju’s henchmen had offered Rs 10 lakh for each acre and Rs 1 lakh as advance. “They have not given the remaining amount even after four months or any agreement copy. Now, they have cut trees in our lands and laid a seven-kilometre road of 40 feet width,” a farmer’s wife Lakshmi told media persons. 
 
 The collector said there was no land pooling of either   or the GVMC in the area. “We do not have any idea of the constructed road. We will examine and take action against those responsible. If anybody threatened the farmers, they should have lodged a police complaint and the district administration would initiate action immediately,” Pravin Kumar said.
