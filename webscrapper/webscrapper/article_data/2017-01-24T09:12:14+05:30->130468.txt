CHANDIGARH: SAD president   has asked   president Captain   to tell Punjabis why he had never gone to jail on the SYL canal issue.

 “You seem to have joined the despicable   team in lying and deceiving Punjabis. You also seem to be suffering from amnesia.You forgot to tell Punjabis that it was you who invited Indira Gandhi to Kapoori to start digging of the SYL canal.You also forgot to tell them that it was Badal who courted arrest on the SYL issue. You have not courted arrest on any people's issue even once. Whom are you trying to fool?“ he said in a statement issued on Monday .
 
 Stating that Amarinder was trying to cover up his tracks by making “misleading“ statements on SYL, Badal said, “You should have some shame for covering up the evil deeds of Indira Gandhi. It is obvious you are doing this to please her grandson   and be named the party's CM candidate“.
 
 Badal added, “We have already done what you are promi sing to do. It is obvious you don't read the newspapers as you rarely stay in Punjab. You are promising to stop construction of the SYL canal when the SAD-BJP has already done that. We have even transferred the land on which the canal stands back to the farmers.What more can you do?“ Asking Amarinder not to try to “fool the people“, he said his role in construction of the canal and the role of his party was well documented. “Your party gave 50% of Punjab's water to Rajasthan. Following recognization of the state another fifty per cent was earmarked for Haryana.
 
 Asserting that this would indeed be Amarinder's last election, the SAD president said, “The shelf life of your lies is over. People realize you have no commitment for Punjab or Punjabis.“
