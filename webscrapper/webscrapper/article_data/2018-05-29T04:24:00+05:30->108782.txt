Vadodara: Five builders, who were booked for abetting suicide of civil contractor Alpesh Thakkar, filed for anticipatory bails in the sessions court.

 Dilip Trabadiya, Nimit Sanghani, Bharat Agrawal, Ketan Patel and Dipak Ambani, who allegedly owed money to Thakkar, were named as accused in the complaint given by the deceasedâ€™s wife Hina. 
 
 The builders have sought anticipatory bail pleading innocence in the case. Their applications will be heard by the court on Wednesday.
 
 Besides the five, further hearing in the anticipatory bail plea of Dilip Chauhan who had lent money to Thakkar will also be heard on Wednesday.
 
 Earlier Nilesh Gandhi, director of Cube Construction Engineering, was granted bail by the court. After the case of abetment of suicide was registered against 11 builders and Chauhan, all the accused had gone underground. However, after he was granted anticipatory bail, Gandhi turned himself in. After interrogation, he was allowed to go against a bond of Rs 50,000.
