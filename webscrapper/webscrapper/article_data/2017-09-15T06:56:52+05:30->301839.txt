KOLKATA: A Class-IV student of a school in  , was allegedly raped by her teacher in the staffroom on Thursday . The accused was arrested and charged under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

 “The accused,   (55), was an assistant teacher who lived near the school. The 10-year-old fell ill when she returned home and her mother took her to a doctor's chamber, where she spoke about what had been done to her. The family lodged a complaint and Mondal was subsequently arrested,“ a senior police officer said.
 
 Falta police station OC   confirmed that action was taken as soon as the complaint was lodged. However, the school authorities said that they had received complaints regarding Mondal's behaviour in the past but none of the parents approached the police.
 
 “It seems the accused molested the girl for quite a few days. Her mother told us that she was behaving abnormally for a while after returning from school. It was only on Thursday when she fell ill that she opened up to her mother, after being examined by the doctor. We have sent the girl for medical tests. If rape is confirmed, we will ensure that the teacher receives severe punishment,“ another officer said.
