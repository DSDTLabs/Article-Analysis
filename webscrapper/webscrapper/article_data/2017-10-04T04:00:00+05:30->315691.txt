Vadodara: The injunction application filed by former vice-president (VP) of M S University Students’ Union (MSUSU) Priyanka Patel to stay the university elections for violating guidelines of Lyngdoh Committee was rejected by a civil court here.

 Patel, who is also contesting for the post of general secretary of MSUSU, had approached the court on September 25 seeking the court’s directive to stay the students’ union polls. She had moved the court on the grounds that the election notification has been issued in violation of the guidelines recommended by the committee headed by former chief election commissioner JM Lyngdoh.
 
 Even before the court could deliver its order, Jaydev Acharya, a fourth year student of Baroda School of Legal Studies of Faculty of Law, joined as a party in the matter on September 29 as students elections are extension of fundamental right.
 
 On Tuesday, before the court of additional chief judicial magistrate D R Joshi delivered its order, Acharya argued before the court that Patel has malicious intentions therefore she filed the suit. “Patel filed the suit saying that guidelines of Lyngdoh Committee are being violated, but she, herself, is violating the guidelines by putting up her hoardings across the university campus,” Acharya told TOI.
 
 The court on Tuesday accepted Acharya’s arguments and rejected Patel’s application to stay the polls.
 
 In 2014 too a law student of the university had got a stay order from the court a day before the polls for implementing the guidelines of the Lyngdoh Committee.
