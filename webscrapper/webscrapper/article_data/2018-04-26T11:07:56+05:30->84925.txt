BHOPAL: Students in the city are celebrating the end of their final exams after appearing in Economics re-exam on Wednesday. They said that the paper was easy compared to the one that was leaked on March 26. 

 The anxiety of students vanished after finding that the paper was easy. There were around 15 centres in the city at which hundreds of students appeared for the re- exam.
 
 Talking to TOI, students said that the paper was 'extremely easy' and would help them fetch good marks. "It was more like an improvement test and we actually improved because paper was a cakewalk," said Muskaan Nema of Sagar Public school. 
 
 Many students said they were a little worried, not on account of being ill-prepared but because of the possibility of having tougher question paper this time. "It was irritating to write the same paper again. I wasn't afraid of it but it made me mad over loss of time because I have to prepare myself for professional exams. But thankfully today's paper was very easy," said another student  . A student of Campion school   said that paper was quite similar to the previous one. "In fact, it was much easier than the previous paper."
 
 Sagar Public School's economics teacher   said that "students were fretting over re-exam but now they are relieved. The paper was extremely easy."
 
 Professor   said the re-exam had caused immense tension in the entire family. "We had planned holiday trips to south India and when we were travelling, we heard about the paper leak, but now thankfully, the re-exam is over."
 
 A parent   told TOI that one of the main worries of her son was that he had done so well last time and the paper was easy. "The re-exam had created a psychological pressure on him. But now he is happy and relieved."
