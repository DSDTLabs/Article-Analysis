LUCKNOW: Has putting Home in order delayed portfolio allocation in UP? There were rumours doing rounds that home portfolio has become a bone of contention between   and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya. 

 Sources told TOI that the department would remain with the chief minister as has been the convention in the past while   are likely to be allotted   by Tuesday.
 
 What gave credence to the speculations was a whisper campaign by supporters of   and Maurya in the BJP office. A Maurya supporter told TOI that this was the discussion for which the chief minister and his deputies Maurya and Dinesh Sharma huddled throughout the day. 
 
 Sources in the government told TOI that besides Home, distribution of other portfolios was also being discussed.   ministers Dharmpal Singh and Minister of State Mohsin Raza were also seen going inside the VVIP guest house. 
 
 Party sources said portfolios to ministers had been decided in New Delhi under guidance of BJP chief Amit Shah, when UP BJP chief Keshav Maurya, UP in charge Om Mathur and UP organisation secretary Sunil Bansal had flown to New Delhi on the evening of March 18 a day before the swearing-in day. 
 
 Bansal's meeting with the chief minister at VVIP Guest House on Monday morning further corroborated that Shah was keeping close watch on UP government. Bansal is known to be a close confidante of Shah. 
 
 A senior party leader, requesting anonymity, said Home portfolio would most likely remain with the chief minister as it calls for being led with iron hands.
