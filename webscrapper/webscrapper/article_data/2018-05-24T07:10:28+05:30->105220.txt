ISLAMABAD: A leader of the opposition party Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in a late night television talk show on Tuesday flew off the handle, swinging a slap across the cheek of the country’s privatisation minister.

 
 The PML-N government’s minister   apparently called Naeemul Haq a ‘thief ’, at which the PTI leader smacked the minister. According to  , anchor on Geo News, both the leaders were present in the   studio of the channel while he was moderating the show from  . Following the incident, Aziz and PPP leader  , another guest speaker, walked out from the TV show.
 
 Aziz said the incident was ‘pre-planned’. “It shows the frustration of PTI leaders and their handlers. Despite throwing their weight behind the army and the judiciary, their public support diminishes daily.”
 
 Haq, however, tweeted that while it was an unfortunate spur of the moment reaction, Aziz’s “abusive language” against the PTI leadership and attack on army generals was unacceptable. Haq is not new to controversy. Last year, former PTI member Ayesha Gulali accused him of sexual harassment. Also, few years ago, Haq had thrown a glass of water on PPP leader Jamil Soomro during a live TV show.
