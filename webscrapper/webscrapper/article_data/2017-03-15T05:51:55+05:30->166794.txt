NAGPUR: Arvi, hardly  , had to be rescued by police after none of her relatives, including her parents, were ready to keep her. After an ugly family drama at Lalgunj, she was sent for medical examination and then given shelter at a government home with the initiative of the police.

 Arvi, the only daughter of Akash and Neha Tote, was almost abandoned in front of her father’s uncle Krishna’s residence at Lalgunj. Her parents were leaving her there since the couple had differences. When the uncle too refused to take responsibility of the child, there was a bizarre drama in the locality as the parents kept the girl at his doorstep and started to leave. The neighbours were alerted to the quarrel, and even as they intervened, Neha sneaked away from the place. Akash was detained by the neighbours, who also alerted   police.
 
 The cops said Akash, who earns a livelihood as a painter, had a love marriage with Neha. It is learnt that Neha works as a dancer with an orchestra troupe from Uttar Pradesh. The couple had earlier stayed at Pune and other places, before settling in Nagpur. Their relations had soured due to mutual distrust.
 
 Earlier, Akash’s mother stayed with the couple and used to look after Arvi. After her death, the couple started fighting over the parenthood of the girl, with Akash alleging that the child was not his.
 
 As the fight escalated, Neha wanted to give up her daughter. They first approached Akash’s sister, but she refused to take care of the girl. As Akash did not have any other relatives, the couple approached Krishna, who too refused to look after the child.
 
 Assistant PI LS Tasre of Shanti Nagar police station said cops have registered offences against the parents for abandoning the baby and arrested Akash. “The couple had also cruelly beaten up the baby, that had left several marks on her body, but there is no permanent damage. The baby was safely taken to  , where it is now recuperating from initial shock,” he said.
