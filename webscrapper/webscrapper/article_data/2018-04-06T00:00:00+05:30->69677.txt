A dance troupe was also invited for the party, which performed on the Ghoomar song, which led to a lot of applause. Some interesting games were also played at the do. The most engaging one turned out to be when the besties among the guests were quizzed about how much they knew each other. The game did not end there as they had to sing a song for each other.   and   sang Tere Jaisa Yaar Kahan.
