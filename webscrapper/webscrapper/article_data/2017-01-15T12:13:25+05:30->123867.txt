BHUBANESWAR:   national general secretary Arun Singh here on Saturday said the central government or the BJP has nothing to do with the pace of CBI probe into the chit fund scam. The BJD and the   have termed the CBI action political vendetta by the Centre and protested against it. 

 Dismissing the allegations that the CBI action was political vendetta, Singh said, "CBI is an autonomous organisation. Neither BJP as a political party nor the central government has anything to do with its action." He was speaking to reporters after releasing party's campaign materials for the coming panchayat elections.
 
 Singh's own party colleague   on Friday had expressed doubts about CBI's sincerity. Bijoy had questioned why CBI woke up after a deep slumber of around three years. Singh said the CBI is moving on its own pace, which one may criticise as fast or slow. To a query on timing of its raids in state with panchayat elections round the corner, Singh said, "Anytime the central agency would raid an office or pick up someone, similar question would be raised. It is for CBI to decide."
 
 The youth wing and students wing of the BJD had staged protest against the CBI action on Thursday. Singh said the baseless allegations are coming from the BJD because the Naveen Patnaik-led party is scared of the BJP like never before.
