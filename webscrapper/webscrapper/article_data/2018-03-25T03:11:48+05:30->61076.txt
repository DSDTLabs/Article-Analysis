NEW DELHI:   on Saturday released a video showing a group of youths thrashing an SHO with umbrellas and sticks during the protest by JNU and DU students on Friday. The video has been uploaded on the   account of DCP (PRO) Madhur Verma asking people to help identify the youth. 

 The SHO, Satish Chander Sharma, is in the ICU with severe head injuries. Police said that a case will be registered against the youths once they are identified.
 
 DCP Verma said the inspector had tried to stop a protester from climbing a barricade during which a youth suddenly attacked him with a stick or an umbrella-like object at the back of his head.
 
 “Some of the constables have fractured their arms and suffered head injuries and bite marks as miscreants had climbed on the barricades and attacked them. We have appealed to everyone to help identify the youths so that appropriate actions can be taken,” said DCP Verma.
 
 In another video, a youth is seen climbing a barricade and attacking a policeman when he is asked to get down. He also abused the cop when they tried to pull him down. Police said they have asked the students to help them identify the youth.
 
 Though no case has been registered in any of the assault incidents, police said appropriate actions would be taken against anyone found assaulting the policemen or protesters. “We are scanning through the footage shot during the protests to identify the miscreants. Though most of the faces have been blurred, we will identify them using all means,” said a senior police officer.
