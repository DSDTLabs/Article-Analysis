Kolhapur: Rationalist leader N D Patil met chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday, to put forward the demand of lawyers to set up a circuit bench.

 Fadnavis assured Patil that he will soon convene a meeting of lawyers to discuss the issue.
 
 “Fadnavis has assured Patil he will fix a meeting date within a week. The chief minister will let him know about the details of when the delegation of lawyers can meet him and discuss the long pending issue,” said an official of kolhapur district bar association ( ).
 
 “We expect the appointment date before the monsoon session of the state legislature starts so that, if necessary, the issue can be introduced in the state assembly for discussion. We will also be meeting the MLAs from Kolhapur district, requesting them to raise the issue in the legislative assembly,” he said.
 
 “A delegation of lawyers from all six districts: Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Solapur, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg will be discussing the issue with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis,” he said.
 
 Lawyers are fighting to set up a circuit bench in Kolhapur and had also gone on strike for their demand. The agitation was called off after authorities assured them that Bombay High   will take appropriate decision regarding their demand.
 
 However, high court authorities have not yet taken a decision. Hence, lawyers are planning to press for their demand by using different methods. They expect the state government will take steps to ensure the circuit bench will be set up in Kolhapur.
