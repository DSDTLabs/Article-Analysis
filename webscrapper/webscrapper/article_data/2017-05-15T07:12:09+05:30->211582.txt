  The santhe held at Sri Ram Mandir Grounds, Rajajinagar, on Sunday was marked by a unique display of daily-use commodities made from recycled goods. The products made by artisans from across Karnataka covered a wide range -- pencils made of recycled newspapers, cutlery made of sugarcane waste and kitchen bags made of potato starch. 
 
 Another initiative, 'Plant the paper', promoted the need for planting trees using handmade paper, with seeds embedded in it, which, on disposal, would sprout plants. The seeds included those of flowering plants, methi and dhaniya.
 
 Among the other attractions at the event were solar and terracota waste-composting units, and a large variety of handmade bags, envelopes and reusable sanitary napkins.
