JAMMU: Some former and serving   personnel have rejected the accusations made by constable   about the quality of food served to troopers at the border.  , a former BSF man, said cadres posted to forward positions in Army-controlled locations received food as per the Indian Army diet chart. The menu is simple, and good, if not the best, he added.“Bad food, as has been alleged, is never served,” Singh said.

 Balwinder Singh, a serving BSF jawan, added, “The food is average, but not bad.” “Every company inducts one quartermaster and mess incharge who are responsible for the mess for the company’s jawans,” he said.
 
 A jawan serving in a Naxalism-hit area said on the condition of anonymity that Tej’s food claims might be a reflection of his personal choice. The BSF spokesperson said, “In comparison to international border deployment, serving conditions are harsh(at LoC) as weather and terrain both pose difficult challenges... However, rations are authorised to all, and available in good quality, quantity and variety.” 
 
 An officer from the Guwahati BSF frontier said every jawan was provided with rations worth Rs 2,905 per month. “The menu is prepared keeping in view the essential calories the jawans need for their job,” he added.
 
 ABSF source said, “In rare cases, jawans deployed in far-flung areas may not get the prescribed menu owing to transportation problems due to landslides and other natural calamities. But this only lasts two-three days at the most as supplies are restored fast.”
