KOCHI: The Kalamassery police probing the mysterious death of a 25-year-old man at the   is awaiting forensic test results of his internal organs to take action on possible medical negligence in the case.

 Jerin Michael, a sound engineering student at a private institute at Pachalam here had died, according to relatives, without receiving proper medical attention. He was taken to the hospital around 6.30am on March 25 following severe stomach ache. He died around 11.20pm without getting consultation of the on call surgeon, the relatives had told police.
 
 Kalamassery sub inspector   said that though there was severe inflammation of Jerin’s appendix, it was not ruptured. “The exact cause of death cannot be ascertained as the postmortem report states the final opinion as ‘pending’. However, there are signs of appendicitis causing the stomach ache,” said the SI.
 
 Police sources said that there is a high chance of medical negligence. “Forensic surgeons are of the opinion that the youth could’ve been saved with timely medical intervention. However, the postmortem report is silent on medical negligence. The cause of the death can be conclusively ascertained only once the lab results are in,” said a senior officer.
 
 Kalamassery police had taken over the case, registered at Edathala police station under Section 174 of the CrPC, based on the statement of the deceased’s relatives.
