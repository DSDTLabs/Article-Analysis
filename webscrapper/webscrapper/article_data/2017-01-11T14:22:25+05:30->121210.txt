GHAZIABAD: Former BSP Rajya Sabha MP   joined the   (BJP) in New Delhi on Wednesday. Kashyap had been ousted from the BSP by party supremo Mayawati in August last year after he was jailed in the dowry death case of his daughter-in-law, Himanshi.

 The five-year Rajya Sabha term of Kashyap had also come to an end in 2016. Kashyap is currently out on bail in the dowry death case in which he had been named as accused along with his son and wife.
 
 "I am joining the BJP out of a sense of national interest. I am quite inspired by the work done by prime minister Narendra Modi," Kashyap told TOI.
 
 Kashyap had been associated with the BSP for the past over three decades since the inception of the party in 1984. His daughter-in-law, Himanshi, had been found shot dead inside a washroom of the Kashyap residence in April 2016. He had been subsequently arrested after being alleged of dowry death by Himanshi's parents. He had been later granted bail by the Allahabad High Court.
