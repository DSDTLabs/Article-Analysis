 Kaushalya filed an application under Section 311 of CrPC in the court to allow Akash to appear in the court as an additional witness. In her application, she said the police had recorded the statement of Akash during the investigation of the case but while presenting the challan in the court his name was not included.
 
 She maintained that the statement of Akash was of utmost importance and as the trial was still in the consideration of the court hence his name should be included in the list of witnesses. Taking up Kaushalya’s plea, the court issued a notice to the opposite party to file its reply on March 15.
