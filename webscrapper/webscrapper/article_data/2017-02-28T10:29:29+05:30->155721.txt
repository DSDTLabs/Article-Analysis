CHENNAI:  , it appears, rank low on credit-worthiness. With arguably lesser preference for women farmers, government schemes like the   (KCC) programme seem to benefit women far lesser, according to   expert  .

 “Women are seldom title owners to tracts of land which they cultivate. It is usually under their husband’s names, ensuring they don’t get access to credit,” he noted, adding that the Kisan credit card, which is to be converted to RuPay cards through NABARD, has remained a problem area as women in agriculture continue to be denied access to this facility.
 
 “Nearly 70% of those employed in agriculture in the country happen to be women,” he said, emphasising on the need to fix this gap. He was speaking at ‘Creation and Nurturing of Women Tech Entrepreneurs’ organised by the   park in the city, which incubates innovations in the biotechnology and applied disciplines. 
 
 Invoking the sixth five-year plan adopted by the government, he stressed on the need for women empowerment across sectors, with agriculture being at the forefront. 
 
 Cutting off women from the industry, he warns, will also have an effect on specific crops raised by them. It will have an adverse effect on regional millet varieties like samai,thinai, kezhveragu cultivated by women in the south. 
 
 These, he says are more rich and preserve soil, as they inherently have soil-fertilising properties unlike cash crops like rice.
