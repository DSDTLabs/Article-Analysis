NEW DELHI: Deputy CM   on Wednesday, February 28, wrote to the   to ensure that private schools do not withhold   admit cards of any student. The education minister had received complaints against certain private schools, which had withheld   of students on the pretext of non-payment of “hiked” fees or “arrears”.

 Sisodia, in his direction, named Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s Mehta Vidyalaya (KG Marg), The Indian School (Sadiq Nagar) and   (Kailash Colony) as the few schools against which complaints had been received. “I have received complaints from several distraught parents about harassment from schools…The directorate must ensure that all children of these schools receive their admit cards without any delay,” wrote the deputy CM.
 
 Principal of The Indian School Tania Joshi, however, told TOI that all students had been given their admit cards, “except for two students of Class XII, who were to come on Wednesday to collect them.” The school has not withheld any child’s admit card, Joshi said, adding that the notice to her school was a first as no previous communication was made asking for a clarification on the matter.
 
 The principals of Bluebells International School, Suman Singh, and Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s Mehta Vidyalaya, Anju Tandon, did not comment on the issue.
 
 Sisodia clarified that no school could ask for increased fees until their audits are done, and that this has been said in high court. Sisodia asked the DoE to submit an action taken report to his office in 24 hours and look into the matter urgently.
