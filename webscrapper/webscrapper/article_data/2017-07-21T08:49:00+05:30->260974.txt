Porvorim: State government is planning to   mining   which are due to expire on March 31, 2020, chief minister Manohar Parrikar told the House in a written reply on Thursday.

 Parrikar, who is also the   minister, was replying to a question tabled by Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral whether the government has any plans to auction the leases that have not been renewed.
 
 He said that the government has complied with the Supreme Court directives issued in 2014 on illegal mining and there are 277 valid iron ore mining leases. Sources informed that the leases span over places such as Pernem, Sattari, Ponda, Sanguem, Bardez, Bicholim, Tiswadi and Quepem talukas, sources said.
 
 “So far 89 leases have been renewed and 188 got the benefit of ‘deemed’ extension as per the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015,’’ Parrikar said in his written reply. “Out of the 89, operations are on in 48 leases. Ore production for the year 2015-16 was recorded at 7.29 MT, while in 2016-17 it was 20MT,’’ he said.
 
 Following Shah Commission’s report on illegalities, mining was banned in the state in 2012. It was later lifted in 2014.
 
 As reported by TOI, two years ago, the state government had told the mines ministry in May 2015 that the first block of mining leases is likely to be put up for auction in 2020.
 
 According to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) (MMDR) amendment bill, 2015, once the lease period expires, the leases have to be auctioned.
 
 During the Portuguese era, Goa had 806 mining concessions. In 1987, when concessions were abolished and converted into leases, the number came down to 595 leases.
 
 An official said that auctioning of leases may be subject to the Supreme Court order passed in the special leave petition (SLP) filed by leaseholders challenging the government’s decision to abolish mining concessions and turn them into leases.
