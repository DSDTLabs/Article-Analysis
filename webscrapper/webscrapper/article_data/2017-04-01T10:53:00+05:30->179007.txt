PUNE: The civic body mopped up Rs 65 crore on Friday after property owners flocked to the   building and the ward offices to pay tax for 2016-17 fiscal which helped the civic body cross its target for this financial year. 

 The collection was Rs 1,205 crore, more than the Rs 1,196 crore target set by the municipal commissioner in the 2016-17 budget. However, it fell short of the standing committee’s expectation of Rs 1,444 crore. 
 
 Of the 7.91 lakh transactions this fiscal, 4,300 tax payers cleared their dues on Friday. There are 8.3 lakh assessed properties in the civic limits. 
 
 “We have taken efforts to increase the revenue and provided tax payment facility till March 31 midnight,”  , head of PMC   department, told TOI.
 
 Civic officials carried out special drives. The properties of defaulters were seized and tax dues were collected from the cellphone tower operators. 
 
 Musical bands were hired to play outside defaulters’ homes to nudge them to clear their dues and amnesty schemes was launched for illegal houses. 
 
 “The property tax collection may be affected next year due to the state government’s decision on no fine on residential properties with less than 600 sq ft area not paying tax on time. The administration would earn double tax from such properties,” a senior official said.
 
  which had a target of Rs 400 had earned Rs 390 crore in property tax by Friday. Joint commissioner   said, “The department had kept its 16 divisional offices open till 6pm. The department had sent notices to 65,000 property owners with arrears of more than Rs 10,000 and began a property seizure drive for recovery on March 22.”
