MUMBAI: Exchange of students between the   - a long-pending proposal - is finally to be implemented between three of the older institutes. 

 On the lines of the foreign semester exchange programme, the IITs in the city, Delhi and Roorkee will launch the inter-IIT exchange programme from the autumn semester of 2017-18.
 
 Interested students will be able to spend a semester at the host institutes to gain access to the centres of excellence in other IITs. This is the first time that the IITs are collaborating for academic purposes.
 
 A student representative in a mail to all students mentioned that foreign exchanges are not always viable for students. The communication said: "Engineering programmes abroad are designed in a manner different from what is practised here. Despite scholarships, the expenditure of many foreign exchange programmes is high, making it unaffordable for some students. Spending four months in a completely new country, especially the ones who find it difficult to communicate in English may be a drawback for some students."
 
 A student from first-year electrical engineering at   said he would like to travel to   as he has heard that the department on that campus was very good.
 
 A final-year student said many third- and fourth-year students from IIT-B may not be excited about travelling to the other institutes unless the department had good faculty and research there. "Students would prefer to go to IIT-Kanpur for its aerospace department. In the current facility offered, students would rather prefer to go to Delhi than to Roorkee," the student said.
 
 In the first year the programme will be restricted to only two students travelling to other institutes; in any given semester, any institute will have a maximum of four incoming students and four outgoing students. While the fees of the semester have to be paid to the home institute, students have to bear the living expenses.
