Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday alleged that the Congress government had defrauded Punjab farmers and betrayed their trust by giving them only Rs 167 crore crop loan waiver after promising a comprehensive Rs 90,000 crore relief.

 In a statement issued here, the SAD president said what was shocking was that 70% of small and marginal farmers of the five districts of Malwa, where the “bogus scheme” was rolled out, had been made ineligible for the same. “The entire exercise is riddled with favouritism with Congress legislators and Halqa in charges making the lists at their residences which kept most genuine beneficiaries out of its purview,” he alleged.
 
 He said the government had imposed 1% cess on wheat and paddy besides increasing the market fee. “A loan has been taken by pledging this tax income,” he claimed. This besides weakening state institutions, he said, had also made foodgrain in Punjab more expensive than in neighbouring states.
 
 “This is in stark contrast to the SAD-BJP government headed by S Parkash Singh Badal which waived tubewell bills worth Rs 6,000 crore per annum for 10 years resulting in a Rs 60,000 crore waiver. Each farmer got a relief of more than Rs 60,000 per year,” he claimed.
