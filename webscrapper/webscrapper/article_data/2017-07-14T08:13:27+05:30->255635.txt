CHENNAI: In which language was ' ' written? According to the   government, the answer was Sanskrit, which is why it denied an aspirant a mark in the teachers' recruitment board (TRB) examination for answering that 'Vande Mataram' was penned in  .

 Now, after a round of litigation and court query, the government has corrected itself and acknowledged in the Madras high court that the   song was indeed written in Bengali, but the term 'Vande Mataram' is Sanskrit.
 
 As a result, aspiring teacher K Veeramani, armed with the extra mark, will manage to go past the TRB's cut-off, 70 marks.
 
 The aforementioned question featured in the exam conducted earlier this year; it read, “In which language the song 'Vande Mataram' was written first?“ The choices for the answer were: A) Bengali; B) Urdu; C) Marathi; and D) Sanskrit.“
 
 When denied a mark for answering 'Bengali', Veeramani filed a writ petition in the Madras high court, and, on June 17, Justice MV Muralidharan directed the government to answer the same question posed in the TRB exam. On Thursday, TN advocate general R Muthukumaraswamy told the court that though the term 'Vande Mataram' was Sanskrit, the song was written in Bengali.
