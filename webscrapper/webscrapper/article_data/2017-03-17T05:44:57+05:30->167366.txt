LUCKNOW: The   from the city admitted there was one   in the mathematics paper held on March 15. But they said they hadn’t received any   from any colleges around the city, hence the matter has not been taken up to the council. In case there were complaints from other cities, the council would issue a notification.

 The fourth question in section A of the paper was compulsory and carried 10 marks. Many students will face a loss of 10 marks in case the council doesn’t take up the matter.
 
 ISC students on Thursday had complained of a wrong question in their mathematics paper, but no one objected formally to any of the exam conveners. Lucknow is divided into six zones with an examination convener appointed in each zone. 
 
 Confirming there was one wrong question in the paper which was compulsory to attempt, convener of Zone D Swati Verma, said “We have neither received any mail from the council, nor any official complaint of a wrong question from my zone that comprises Gomtinagar.” 
 
 Similarly, Mala Mehra, Convener of Zone C, which covers areas like Mahanagar, Faizabad Road and Indiranagar, said, “The council will decide over, whether the question was wrong or not and if it is found so, the question will be deemed null and void and students who attempted it will get full marks.” 
 
 A student of CMS, Gomtinagar said, “If this question had not been there, I could have scored full marks in the paper.” Another student hoped the particular question would be checked with leniency, since a lot of time was lost in attempting it.
