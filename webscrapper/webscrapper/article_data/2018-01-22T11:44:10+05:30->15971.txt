IDUKKI: Members of laity organization, Archdiocese movement for transparency (AMT), distributed a two-page notice in churches under the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese against cardinal   after Sunday mass. 

 The notice criticized the cardinal, citing the controversial land deal that resulted in a big loss for the church.
 
 "The land sale decision was taken by cardinal Mar George Alencherry, Fr Joshy Puthuva and Msgr Sebastian Vadakkumpadan. Puthuva was the finance officer of the church and   his assistant. Auxiliary bishops didn't get any information about the controversial land deal," alleged the notice.
 
 The notice further stated that the archdiocese had incurred a debt of Rs58 crore while buying land to construct building for a medical college. 
 
 "Earlier, many priests had opposed the medical college proposal. But, the cardinal went ahead, despite their dissent. As part of the controversial land deal, the archdiocese lost over Rs 37 crore," alleged the notice.
 
 The notice raised issues due to the controversial land deal. "After the land deal, the administration system of the archdiocese failed, the archdiocese lost its financial stability, civil and canon laws were violated. There was no transparency," it claimed.
 
 "The archdiocese needs transparency in financial deals. The three panel reports already has found certain malpractices in the land deal. Till date, the commission reports haven't been published. If   is the problem, he should be removed from the archdiocese," said AMT member Anna Shibi.
