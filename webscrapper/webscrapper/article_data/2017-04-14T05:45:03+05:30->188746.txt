 The incidents also stranded passengers for more than one-and-a-half hours. Police filed two FIRs in connection with the midnight drama.
 
 The drama began after the bus conductor asked a woman to vacate the seat she had been occupying since a man, who boarded the bus at Thrissur, had booked it online. A police circle inspector, Gopakumar, questioned the conductor and pointed out that the woman was occupying a seat reserved for ladies.
 
 The conductor, however, stood his ground, and maintained that the seat, number 20, should be allotted to the man since he had booked it in advance.
 
 A heated argument followed, and the police officer informed the matter to his colleagues in Perumbavoor, who flagged down the bus around 11.55pm.
 
 The police informed the conductor that a case would be registered against him for asking a woman to vacate the seat reserved for ladies.
 
 Even as the argument went on, the conductor collapsed and had to be shifted to a hospital. He later filed a police complaint saying the circle inspector had harassed him, besides threatening to get him dismissed from service.
 
 The KSRTC employee also cited that he has been under medication for high blood pressure.
 
 The inspector also filed a complaint saying that the conductor had flouted norms.
 
 KSRTC officials here, meanwhile, said the incident had not come to their notice. They, however, said even if a man had booked a seat normally reserved for ladies, the conductor could ask him to vacate it for a woman.
