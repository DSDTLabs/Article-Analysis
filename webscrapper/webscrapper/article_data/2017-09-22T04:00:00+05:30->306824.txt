Rajkot:   

 The fire was triggered by the bursting of a nozzle of the CNG filling pipe. 
 
 “Two autorickshaws were charred in the accident. It was a chain reaction. The rickshaw, in which the CNG was being pumped into, exploded into flames and that spread to the other rickshaw that was parked behind it. Both rickshaws got burnt in a matter of minutes. Two occupants in one of the rickshaws,—Imran Kaida (18) and his cousin Afiz Sawan (15)—who jumped out of the rickshaw the moment the fire started, received serious burn injuries on their faces, hand and feet. The fire was put out by four water tenders,” said a fire brigade official.
