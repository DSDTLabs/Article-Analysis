BHOPAL: In a planned move, state Congress attacked the ruling   in the state assembly, outside the House on Wednesday, on the issue of families affected by   dam. The party staged a dharna and courted arrest as a mark of protest. 

 Congress members first demanded a discussion on Sardar Sarovar oustees in the assembly. When Speaker Sitasaran Sharma adjourned the House sine die, Congress MLAs staged a sit-in outside the House as a mark of protest.
 
 “We know the state government was trying to evade the issue of Sardar Sarovar in view of assembly elections in  . But, Congress would continue its protest,” said Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh after the adjournment. 
 
 The Congress members later held a foot march from the assembly to the chief minister’s official residence. Around 1 pm, Congress MLAs Jitu Patwari, Govind Singh, Bala Bachchan, Sanjay Yadav, Sunderlal Tiwari among others, started foot march from the assembly under the leadership of Ajay Singh. 
 
 Around 1.30 pm, the MLAs were intercepted by the police near Patrakar Bhavan where they organised a sit-in against the state government. A handful of MLAs spearheaded by Jitu Patwari dodged the police and reached Raj Bhawan planning a move towards CM’s official residence. But, they were arrested.
 
 The police arrested Congress MLAs led by Ajay Singh and sent them to jail. The MLAs were released later in the evening.
 
 “When MLAs cannot meet the chief minister how public can. Congress will lodge its protest throughout the state,” LoP Ajay Singh told reporters before courting arrest. 
 
  minister Umashankar Gupta said the Congress move to disrupt proceedings of the House was pre-planned. 
 
 Minister of state for general administration and   (NVDA) Lal Singh Arya said, “Congress is reiterating old demand as it is not aware of the new developments and relief given by the BJP government. Their protest is baseless and aimed at gaining a political mileage.”
