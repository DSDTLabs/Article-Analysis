MUMBAI: The breezy seafront along   seems to intermittently sway and waiver the civic body's plans to stop people from jumping over the road near  . 

 In the latest move to keep people from vaulting over the road divider, the   has put up new barricades on a small stretch along the Queen's Necklace on a trial basis. Prior to this, the BMC had pulled out art decor bollards which it had put up along the road median. 
 
 The BMC justified its latest move by stating that the traffic police had advised it about pedestrians taking a short cut to the beach by jumping over the divider even as vehicles zip past Netaji   Road.
 
 A BMC official said the crowds to the beach on weekends are larger still. "The traffic police had informed us that people with kids often jump over the divider despite a foot over-bridge that stands a few metres ahead," said the official. "We decided to place these barricades after getting the heritage panel's nod." He said the new barricades have been placed on a small stretch "on an experimental basis".
 
 Residents questioned the need to remove bollards placed in 2006 during the Marine Drive restoration project and put up plants. Atul Kumar of Nariman Point Churchgate Residents' Association said, "The earlier bollards did not deter visibility of the sea and were made of stuff that doesn't rust or corrode." When TOI visited the spot on Thursday, little had changed. Many slid between the barricades and jumped across the road.
