LUDHIANA: The architects from   and members of cement manufacturers association organised a seminar on   for the engineers of various departments on Wednesday evening. The experts claimed that the concrete roads can be used with longterm benefit for national highways, rural roads connecting highways with villages as well as roads within cities. In the former times, roads were mainly made with bitumen.

 Mayor   and   commissioner   also attended the seminar. The experts explained that most of the roads, whether highways or within municipal limits, are all busy with traffic during day and night and it hardly leaves any time for satisfactory maintenance. Moreover, roads are national assets like seaports, airports. Therefore, they should also have longlife without major maintenance.
 
 Heavy rain fall, heavy traffic and massive density of vehicles destroy bitumen roads very soon, demanding maintenance. Cement roads with nearly no maintenance prove to be a very economical and effective national asset in long-run. Detailed presentation on planning, designing and execution of concrete roads within town was also given.
 
 For long term assets, the criteria is lifecycle cost that is what will be the total cost at the end of life for the asset which includes initial cost plus recurring maintenance cost. This has been proved world-wide that cement concrete road is cheaper than bitumen road when seen from lifecycle cost angle.
 
 Bitumen can be treated as imported material because bitumen is made from imported crude oil. However, cement and aggregates, which are required for making concrete road are all produced from local resources and therefore, there is no foreign exchange outflow in case of cement use. 
 
 Meanwhile, the MC officials claimed that if they have to construct cemented roads, they require a lot of funding in one go. Moreover, the residents are not much aware and they dig roads for taking water and sewerage connections without permission.
