SRINAGAR: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister   on Sunday questioned what   had achieved, claiming cashless transactions were declining while fake currency in circulation was increasing.

 "Cashless transactions (declining) Fake currency in circulation (increasing). Almost entire lot of notes demonetised back in the banks. So what is the achievement?" Omar wrote on Twitter.
 
 The   working president also said the BJP was feeling uneasy about the outcome of assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 "Two days of campaigning in his own constituency. Should we be reading more in to this than just the PM enjoying being on the campaign trail?" Omar asked.
