JAIPUR: If the state anti-corruption bureau ( ) is allowed a free hand in probing scams and scandals, chief minister   would have to vacate office and half her council of ministers would be in jail for corruption, leader of opposition   said on Saturday.

 In a sharp attack on the Raje-government, Dudi said it was targeting Congress leaders to shift public attention from corruption cases coming up against her ministers.
 
 “Former legislator   was arrested (on Friday) at the CM’s instructions as part of the strategy to deviate public attention from the state’s biggest scam ever, the Rs 45,000-crore mining scam, of the Raje-government. The ACB is being used as a political tool against the Congress,” Dudi claimed.
 
 “Two senior IAS officers were jailed in NRHM and mining scams. Scandals exposed in the PHED department left everyone surprised at the nexus of corruption. But the key players in these corruption cases were shielded because they were part of the council of ministers,” Dudi said.
 
 The leader of opposition said the state BJP government was hatching conspiracies against the Congress leaders. “The CM is targeting Congress leaders from Jodhpur (ex-CM Ashok Gehlot’s home turf) out of political vindictiveness,” Dudi said. He added, “This is being done since corruption cases have come up against her (Raje’s) ministers one after another in past three years. In the ‘Lalitgate’ case, the CM’s name was involved and there was uproar even in the parliament.”
 
 Dudi said the Congress had been demanding CBI probe in the Rs 45,000-crore mining scam but the BJP governments at Centre and state were not allowing it. “If the CM really wants to rid the state of corruption, she should allow the ACB a free hand in probing mining, NRHM and PHED scams. She should show the courage to then table the ACB reports in the state assembly,” the leader of opposition said.
