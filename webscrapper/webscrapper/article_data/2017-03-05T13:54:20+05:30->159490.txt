PANAJI: Following a crackdown on defaulters, the   of Panaji (CCP) has succeeded in recovering Rs 22.63 lakh from the   (ESG). The dues, pending since 2015, were paid digitally.

 The recovery of this amount will help ease the pressure on the corporationâ€™s coffers to some extent, as it has been struggling for funds to pay salaries and undertake development works. CCP, however, has a long way to go in terms of recovery. Data indicates that defaulters still owe it around Rs 77.28 lakh. The crackdown follows a nudge by the directorate of municipal administration (DMA) to all civic bodies to ensure that pending dues are recovered as soon as possible.
 
 Until February 7 this year, the CCP had issued three reminders to ESG seeking payment for waste management services provided during the International Film Festival of India (Iffi), 2015.
 
 CCP has also struggled to recover arrears from house tax defaulters, including government bodies, which today stands just shy of Rs 10 lakh. CCP sources said that apart from this, the   owes Rs 42.53 lakh towards sopo collection. The contractor for pay parking, too, owes the civic body Rs 24.75 lakh from May 2016 till date.
 
 As per its contract terms, CCP has sought a 9% interest on pending dues, except those in the house  .
