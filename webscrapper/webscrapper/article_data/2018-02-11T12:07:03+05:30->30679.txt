All of last week,   Maitra teased her fans with Insta pics from her secret vacation. Though she insisted that frogs and monkeys were keeping her company, fans asked her to give Dev the photographer’s courtesy and get done with it! I found out that they were in Ubud, Bali, to unwind after a rigorous shooting schedule of Kabir. They briefly showed up in   for a TV event and took off on a holiday thereafter. In fact, Rukmini’s Insta pictures, particularly those in the  , are blatant giveaways, even though she hashtagged one of the clicks as #SecretGateaway. Too bad, nothing is a secret in tinseltown. Don’t they know, even   and   couldn’t keep their   wedding a secret!
