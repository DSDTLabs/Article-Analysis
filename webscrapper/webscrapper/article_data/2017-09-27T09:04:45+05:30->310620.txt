CHENNAI: India off-spinner   may be available for  's first match of the upcoming   season, to be played against Andhra at the Chepauk stadium from October 6.

 Ashwin scored his first half-century, an 82 off 130 balls, in county cricket for Worcestershire on Tuesday .
 
 Ashwin is expected to be back in the city by Oct 1. If the 31-year-old spinner, who wasn't picked for the ongoing Australia ODI series, doesn't feature in the squad for the three-match T20 series against Australia starting Oct 7, then there is every chance of him featuring for TN in the season opener, since the New Zealand ODI series begins from October 22.
 
 A top Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) official said that if   is available then they “are hopeful” of him turning out for TN.
 
 “We are hopeful that he will play for us if he is available. He did play in the inaugural TNPL in 2016. If he plays, it will be a big boost for Tamil Nadu,” said the official.
