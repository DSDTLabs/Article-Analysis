Major Ravi’s upcoming directorial   has several actors from other industries, including Arunoday Singh,   and Priyanka Agrawal. And joining them now is Marathi actress  , who would be playing an army officer.

 The actress tells us, “I play the public relations officer of the Indian army in the film and most of my scenes have been shot in Rajasthan as well as in Georgia. My character will be seen in sequences organising press conferences for the troupe led by   sir’s character.”
 
 On being roped in for the role, Neha says, “A friend of Major sir had seen an ad that I did with Shah Rukh Khan for an award show. He had recommended my name when they were on the lookout for someone to play the character. All my lines are in Hindi so I didn’t have any language issues in the film.”
 
 The actress, though, is excited about grabbing the opportunity and that too in a Mohanlal movie. “He’s a legend and working with him has been a learning experience for me. During the scenes, he would tell me that it’s important for an actor to observe and learn. I have taken his tips and that has helped me a lot during the shoot,” she says. Also, the movie’s director   had been a big support, she adds.
 Neha, meanwhile, had acted in a Mollywood film earlier, for Shajiyem’s yet-to-be-released movie that had Sherlyn Chopra in the lead. “I had shot for the movie in 2013 but it ran into a few hassles, which I am told, is ironed out now. The movie will be releasing soon under the title Azhakiya Kadhal: Beautiful Love,” she says.
 
 1971: Beyond Borders has Mohanlal in two roles, and will also have Asha Sharath, Sudheer Karamana and Saiju Kurup in pivotal roles. The movie will be the fourth instalment in the Major Mahadevan franchise.
