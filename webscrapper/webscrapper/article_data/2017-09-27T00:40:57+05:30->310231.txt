MUMBAI: A year ago, Siddharth Haresh Bhawnani (23) was utterly disappointed. A swollen kidney put paid to his dream of joining the Indian Army. 

 Now he not only topped the overall merit list of the Combined Defence Services (CDS) exam, but also cleared the interview to get selected for training. “Joining the army was my childhood dream. After (last year’s) rejection, I was disappointed, but also equally determined to overcome it. This time, I topped the merit list and got selected for training. I am thrilled that I am going to fulfil my dream,” Bhawnani, who studied chemical engineering, told TOI that he would join the Officers’ Training Academy in Chennai on September 30.
 
 His condition caused by urine accumulation was discovered during a medical examination conducted by the authorities in Bengaluru last year. The Mumbai youth, who was placed second in last year’s merit list, was rejected on medical grounds. Determined not to let this bog him down, he returned to Mumbai and underwent a surgery and cracked CDS exam with flying colours. Siddharth is a resident of Malad east. His father is a businessman, while his mother practises homeopathy. “I am the first one from my family to join the armed forces,” he said. “My family is into various businesses. Therefore, I want to set a new legacy for the future generations in my family,” he added. 
 
 Siddharth has been an athlete from his school days, also represented Maharashtra in roller skating and won national competitions too. He was also a state-level swimmer.
