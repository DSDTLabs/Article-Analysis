CHANDIGARH: A committee, set up after the fire accident at the   – has estimated that the hospital has earned a loss of Rs 50 lakhs. The officials of the panel said that anaesthesia machines, monitors and other instruments had become dysfunctional.

 There are seven operation theatres in the emergency complex. One of the operation theatres (OT 3) caught fire due to a spark in a needle cutter a few days ago. A day after the fire incident, on April 12th, two committees were constituted to investigate the cause and assess the losses.
 
 Dr Arvind  , dean, research, submitted a report stating the cause of the fire on April 15th.
 
 In his report, Rajwanshi recommended that operation theatre number 3 must be increased in size and should have an exit space.
 
 Nehru hospital building, which houses the operation theatre complex, is one of the oldest buildings. The building is not designed to manage such incidents. Last year, the institute consulted IIT,  , for fire audit.
