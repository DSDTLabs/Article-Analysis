Ferozepur: Even as the police crackdown began on illegal sand mining in Nawanshahr district on the directions of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh after he saw the illegal activity going on while flying over the area in a chopper, there is no check on contractors involved in sand mining in Ferozepur.

 To prove that no leader from the ruling Congress was involved directly or indirectly in illegal sand mining in the area, Ferozepur (urban) MLA Parminder Singh Pinky toured the area on Tuesday evening and seized five trailers loaded with sand on the Ferozepur-Mallanwala road. Later, cases were registered and trailers were handed over to the police. Pinky said no illegal mining would be allowed in his constituency. He also asked the police officials to keep a strict check on illegal mining and not to succumb to political pressure.
 
 Police later raided the spot where illegal mining of sand was going on near Bandala on the banks of the Satluj and seized two pokeland machines. Illegal sand mining had been rampant in Ferozepur district and operators involved in the business worked with impunity. During a surprise visit to a mining site in Guru Har Sahai subdivision, Ferozepur DC Ramvir was attacked by goons of a contractor. Though the industries department claimed that over 100 FIRs had been registered against 212 persons for illegal mining and a fine of over Rs 13 crore had been slapped, the illegal business was still going on unabated.
 
 Ferozepur SSP Pritam Singh said he had assumed the charge recently but assured that the orders of the CM would be implemented and illegal sand mining in the district would not be tolerated. “I have deputed the teams to keep a check on illegal mining and no one in our area would be allowed to do so,” he said.
