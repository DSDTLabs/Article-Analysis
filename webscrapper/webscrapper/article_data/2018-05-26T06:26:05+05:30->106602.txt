CHENNAI: The newly-widened   near MIOT Hospitals on Mount-Poonamallee High Road may not be officially open to the public as yet but an accident on the viaduct, on a congested stretch to Porur, has already claimed a life. 

 Venkatesan, 25, a resident of  , was riding pillion on a friend's motorcycle on Wednesday afternoon when the two-wheeler smashed into tar drums lining the widened section.
 
 A few residents of the area and commuters note that there have also been several minor accidents on the widened carriageway, which officials expected would reduce traffic snarls and congestion on the vital thoroughfare.
 
 The authorities concerned - that would be the state highways department and the police - are yet to remove the tar drums that caused the fatal accident or take steps to make what is a tricky stretch to navigate past safer.
 
 Police officers and highways officials said the matter was not in their hands - the government is yet to fix a date for the formal inauguration of the widened bridge. 
 
 Residents say using the bridge is perilous because a curve in the road blindsides motorists. "The stretch has a sharp double bend on either side of the bridge, toward Porur and Mount," Manapakkam resident V Nagarajan said. "It was always dangerous but the drums left along the stretch have increased the risk."
 
 When TOI contacted state highways subdivisional officials, they said they were unaware about when the government would officially open the widened bridge. "We expected the opening to take place this week but are awaiting a nod from senior officials. We don't have a say in such things," an official said.
 
 Asked about another criticism of residents, who say a portion of the bridge remains partially closed, the official said: "Motorists are using the original carriageway of the bridge. Only the extended part, which is almost 12m wide, is not yet ready to be used."
