VADODARA: Four persons, including  , the former vice-president of BJP’s Yuva Morcha unit of Waghodiya, were booked for trying to murder a resident of Dashrath village near Ranoli on Saturday midnight.

 A cable operator   and his friend Kiran Kailashgiri were standing outside a hotel in Ranoli when Dalsaniya’s car passed from there. Pereira told police that the side mirror of the car hit Kailashgiri’s hand. Around 10 minutes later, Dalsaniya and three others identified as Sarabjit, Pinkesh and Akash Baman came there on two-wheelers. Cops said Dalsaniya went to hit Pereira with a baseball bat, but he ducked following which he and Kailashgiri ran from there to save their lives. While Pereira hid in an under-construction building, Kailashgiri was nabbed by the four who injured him with a sword.
 
 Hearing the commotion during the melee, locals came out of their houses. The accused fled from there as the crowd started to gather. Pereira could not see who among the four had injured Kailashgiri. 
 
 Earlier, Dalsaniya was booked for firing at his old rival Hardeepsinh Thakor outside the latter’s house at Pratapnagar in November 2014. In March 2016, Dalsaniya had escaped when  , a friend of Thakor, had attempted to attack him, but he was saved as the gun did not fire.
