NAGPUR: The   units across Vidarbha observed a daylong ‘fast’ to protest against the “anti-people policies and divisive politics” of the ruling  , but exposed its own lack of unity within the party. In Chandrapur, where a dais collapsed, saw two rival factions organizing separate functions. In Nagpur, rebels opposing Vilas Muttemwar faction stayed away.

 Even as the Congress high command plans to take on the   government, the two fighting factions led by   Vijay Wadettiwar and ex-MP Naresh Pugalia failed to come together for the protest fast. While Pugalia group staged agitation near Mahatma Gandhi’s statue on Rajiv Gandhi Kamgar Bhawan premises, the Wadettiwar faction staged agitation at Jatpura gate in Chandrapur.
 
 Pugalia blamed the BJP government for rising communal incidents in the country and involvement of BJP minister’s son Arijit Choube in   riots. He charged the BJP with intentionally sowing seeds of hatred in the society for electoral gains. In Nagpur, Muttemwar slammed not only Prime Minister Narendra Modi but also city MP Nitin Gadkari for making false promises to voters to win polls.
 
 The stage at Wadettiwar’s agitation venue collapsed in the afternoon due to overcrowding. However, nobody was injured. After a short disturbance, the collapsed section was raised with a temporary support and the agitation continued till evening.
 
 Factionalism in Nagpur city Congress units has not ebbed even after expulsion of Satish Chaturvedi. So, those aligned with him, including recently appointed AICC’s SC cell chief Nitin Raut preferred to go to Bhandara to join ex-MP   there for the protest fast and thus kept away from the one organized in the city under the leadership of city unit president Vikas Thakre of Muttemwar faction. Ex-MP  , leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve, Praful Gudadhe , Nitin Kumbhalkar and some other corporators travelled to Bhandara along with Raut.
