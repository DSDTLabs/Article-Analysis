NAGPUR: Natya Prashikshan Shibir, a one month acting workshop organized by   and Stri Shiksha from May 1, is all set to present the series of one-act play ‘Wagh Yenar Ahe’. The first part of the series was skilfully presented by the participants at the Hindu Mulinchi Shala, Mahal, on Sunday. 

 This central idea behind organizing this workshop was to provide training and practical experience to the students about the field of acting. 
 
 The act was directed by Sandeep Dabewar and artistes Ashutosh Bolekar and Prasanna Kale played the lead roles. 
 
 Written by Anand Shidid, the play revolved around the life of two characters Deshpande and  , where both are seen beside a railway track inside a railway room. Bolekar played the role of Deshpande who is a government employee and Kale played the role of Barashinge, a peon working in railways.
 
 Boththe characters are dramatically trapped inside the room, where they can sense the presence of a tiger at the only entrance to the room. The act catches attention of the audience as the conversation between the two characters grows with an ascending climax. 
 
 The act gives out a good message to the audience that every person in the world is surrounded by problems of which some are self-created which can be resolved with ease. It talked about dealing with inner demons first and then with the demons of the outer world. 
 
 The event was open to all and was attended by large number of students, theatre enthusiasts, senior citizens, etc. 
 
 Renowned artist Roshan Nandwanshi, who is director and writer at Swanand Sanskrutik Mandal is working hard for the success of the event. The camp is being organized from past twenty years and has given many artistes to the film industry including Amit More, editor of movie ‘Ra.One’ and  , Director of Savdhan India, etc. 
 
 Other part of the play will be held in coming weeks and the workshop will conclude on June 1.
