 He urged people to take up sports.
 
 "Indians have great potential but it does not come up most of the time because of lack of opportunities. Power of positivity is great and we all should take oath to do best in whatever field we are in," he said.
 
 Rathore said that sports ministry's initiative ' ' was not just about playing but its real purpose was to make better doctors, engineers and lawyers etc.
 
 The ministry's ambitious programme aims to scout for talent at the grassroots and provide it substantial long-term scholarship.
 
 He also highlighted the importance of the sports.
 
 "Sport fields are not just for fun. It's a misconception. Sport teaches the most valuable things of life. We all should keep ourselves fit mentally as well as physically," he said.
 
 New Delhi Municipal Council's vice-chairperson  , who was also present at the occasion, urged the people to choose the leaders carefully.
