Panaji: Reacting to the recent high court order which stopped iron ore transportation dumped outside the lease areas, cabinet advisory committee member Vijai Sardesai said, “We have raised serious concern about the order. The petition was filed in the morning and order was passed in the evening. The government was completely unaware about it. The chief secretary did not know about the case being heard in the court,” he added. tnn
