THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/MALAPPURAM: Chief minister   has said that the government will need time to implement the Supreme Court verdict to reappoint DGP T P Senkumar as the state police chief.

 “Those who want to implement the verdict the very next day are upset; they are behind the controversy,” he told reporters while reacting to reports on delay in implementing the verdict. “But for a government, there are many things that have to be referred and considered. It can take a decision only after that. I have already said the Supreme Court verdict is final. The government has no confusion on that. We will take a decision after examining all aspects of the judgment.”
 
 Senkumar had approached the Supreme Court on Saturday, alleging that the government was not implementing the court verdict to reinstate him. He sought initiating contempt proceedings against the chief secretary for not issuing orders re-appointing him.
 
 CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan also said the government would take its time to implement the court order. It has to take legal advice from all concerned before implementing the verdict, he added.
 
 Senkumar was removed from the post of state police chief immediately after the   government came to power. He had earlier challenged the decision in the high court and the administrative tribunal but failed to get a favourable verdict. The Supreme Court had on April 24 dismissed the state government’s contentions and asked it to reinstate Senkumar in the post.
