CHANDIGARH: UT administration   may have to pay more than double the amount previously estimated for flats to be allotted to them under a housing scheme dating to 2008.

 Though the housing scheme was launched 10 years ago, the administration had not implemented it to date due to shortage of land. In a setback to the employees, the administration will now allot land for the scheme at market rate, pushing up the price of flats by more than twice the estimate.
 
 
  
 
 The administration has sent the proposed rate for the land to the Union ministry of finance for approval. The land’s rate has been fixed at the high price as guidelines of the Union ministry of home affairs ( ) state that land cannot be disposed of below the prevailing market rate.
 
 Member of parliament (MP)   had on May 5 met employees who successfully applied for the scheme. In that meeting, she had informed the employees about the administration’s “inability” to allot land below the market rate.
 
 Employees have, so far, agreed to pay for land at market rate.
 
 The market rate is determined by collector rates, which are high in Chandigarh. The collector rate is the lowest at which a property is registered. It is fixed by the administration and revised every year. The allottees of category C flats (one-bed room) will have to shell out around Rs 30 lakh, instead of the earlier Rs 13.5 lakh. The price of category B flats (two-bed room) is expected to go up to Rs 50 lakh, earlier Rs 24.3 lakh. Category A (three-bed room) flats will likely cost around Rs 70 lakh, originally priced at Rs 34.7 lakh.
 
 Earlier this year, MHA had turned down a proposal of the administration to allot land for the housing scheme. Following this,   had taken up the matter up with Union home minister Rajnath Singh, who had assured to resolve the matter.
