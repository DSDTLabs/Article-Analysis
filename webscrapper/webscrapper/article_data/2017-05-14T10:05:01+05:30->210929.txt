VISAKHAPATNAM: It has been nearly five months since the superannuation of the only professor and head of the cardiology department at   ( ), while the only associate professor has also gone on long leave. 

 The department is now left only with an assistant professor and a few post-graduate medicos to run the show while a professor from Kakinada Government Hospital has recently been deputed for alternate days to visit the department.
 
 KGH is the the largest tertiary healthcare centre of north coastal   where around 250-300 out-patients frequent the cardiology department per day. But the department seems to be on the verge of shutting down if the required faculty are not deputed.
 
 Senior doctors from the hospital said a few years ago, there used to be three units headed by three professors in the cardiology department. Two of the units were suppressed by the state government and only one unit with a professor, an associate professor and an assistant professor kept functioning. Head of the department Prof GV Reddy retired in June 2016 while another professor   superannuated in December last year. Since then, the government has not placed any professor for the existing unit.
