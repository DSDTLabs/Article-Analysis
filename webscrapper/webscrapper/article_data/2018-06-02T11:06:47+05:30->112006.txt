Does   leave your stomach feeling sour?   looking for ways to appeal to people who avoid milk because of indigestion are promoting what they describe as a natural, easier-drinking alternative. 

 
 It’s called   milk, which is produced by a subset of cows that produce milk lacking a protein that backers say is associated with milk’s dyspeptic tendencies. That A2 has its skeptics, but the bet is consumers will pay extra to drink milk that might not cause indigestion, gas and bloating.
 
 “Our approach has been, ‘Listen, if you thought you had trouble with milk, try our A2 milk because you may be able to have it,’” said  , whose family farm has both ordinary cows and those producing what he sells as “Premium A2 Guernsey” milk. Backers of this milk claim the A1 protein can cause bloating and other symptoms because of the way it breaks down when digested.
