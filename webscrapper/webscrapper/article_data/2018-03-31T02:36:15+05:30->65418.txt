 According to an MCG official, reports of waste burning have increased due to better vigilance. “MCG has strengthened the vigilance mechanism which is leading to an increase in reported cases. Also, we see more cases of waste burning during winter as some people burn waste to keep themselves warm at night. That is why most cases have been reported in January,” an official said.
 
  blamed the rise in cases on the inefficient waste collection mechanism of the agency recently appointed by the corporation.
