CHANDIGARH: Punjab police's controversial SP  , whose official vehicle was waylaid and used by Pakistan's Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists to reach the Indian   base at Pathankot on January 2, 2016, and orchestrate one of the deadliest attacks on Indian armed forces in recent years, is set to be dismissed from service.

 The   (NIA) had interrogated Salwinder four times last year and subjected him to a lie-detector test after he repeatedly denied any role in the attack, which killed seven security personnel. He was later made a witness in the NIA chargesheet but a parliamentary panel report on February 8 had termed his “release“ by terrorists as “questionable and suspicious“.
 
 A note on his dismissal was prepared by the chief minister's office (CMO) and the home department on Thursday after evaluating legal advice.
 
 Among the five reasons cited for his dismissal, two are of serious nature and involved al legations of sexual harassment by a lady constable in   and bigamy. The note adds that he has been chargesheeted in both the cases. The reasons, however, do not include his role in the attack.
 
 It also states that he was twice absent for a long time from duty in 2012 and 2016 and concludes that the charges were proved after an inquiry and “punishment is being given“. “Absent from duty in 2016 due to a rape and corruption case registered against him during his posting at Gurdaspur. Inquiry is being conducted,“ it says.
 
 Salwinder, who has eight more years for superannuation, was suspended in October last year by the then SAD regime following allegations about his role in drug trade.
