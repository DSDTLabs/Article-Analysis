However,   remained absent.and Sandesh   from the   was in attendance instead. Naik reached the panchayat office at around 10.45am, by which time all the elected members had arrived and marked their attendance. Sources said that the election for sarpanch and deputy sarpanch had to be adjourned after the presiding officer was hospitalized following a bout of sickness. When informed, the BDO sent Gadekar to conduct the polls. Sources said that all 11 members were present, but some raised an objection that it was too late to conduct the elections as it was already past the time mentioned in the notice served to them. They could not reach a consensus prompting Gadekar to adjourn the polls.
 
 The letter sent to the directorate said that despite requests from the seven members, Naik, who had reached late, refused to conduct the first meeting and hold the elections, thus violating the provisions of the Goa Panchayat Raj Act. The members requested the directorate to take appropriate action in the matter which they said had resulted in interference with the administration of the village panchayat and also in the democratic set up of a panchayat.
