 SRINAGAR: Chief minister   on Wednesday indirectly snubbed Kashmir’s grand mufti and vice-chairman of J&K Muslim Personal Board Nasir-ul-Islam for demanding a separate state for Indian Muslims on Tuesday.

 Without naming anyone,   wrote on Twitter, “J&K was neither a party to the partition of our country nor did we support division on religious lines. We as a state opted for the opposite but unfortunately are still paying the price. I strongly condemn any statement made asking for Muslims in India to demand a separate state (sic).”
