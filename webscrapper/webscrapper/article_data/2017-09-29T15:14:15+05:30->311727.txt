TRICHY: It seems surplus rainfall from normal in the last three months is insufficient to address the shortage in potable drinking water supply by the city corporation. With the unprecedented method involving water supply to households on alternate days continuing, the urban civic body is now eyeing the rising   water level to regularise the potable water supply.

 From supplying water twice a day, the civic body has been pushed to the wall restricting water supply on alternate days, which has never been pursued in the history of  . Local body sources maintained that the water demand of city with 9.16 lakhs (as per 2011 Census) stands at 120 MLD (million litres per day). 
 
 However, the civic body despite implementing a contingency plan for Rs 3 crore has been managing to source 92.35 MLD of water daily to the public, as on Thursday. The four major collector wells of Trichy Corporation situated at   have been supplying potable water to as many as 45 overhead tanks daily, of the total 145 overhead tanks in the city, figuratively covering 35 per cent of the city. 
 
 As the Mettur dam water level is crossing 87 feet, with a high possibility to open the dam for irrigation needs in delta districts in the next few days, corporation officials said that the arrival of   water would certainly help the civic body to increase the supply of potable water on a daily basis. 
 
 “Monsoon thus far has not helped to improve our yield from the existing collector wells. Cauvery water if released from the Mettur dam would be helpful to improve the water yield and to restore the practice of supplying potable water on daily basis,” S Amudhavalli, City Engineer, Trichy Corporation.
