BENGALURU: Veena R, a  , was a bundle of nerves as she set out in a   on Monday, one of 51   dedicated to  . The brand-new fleet was flagged off by chief minister Siddaramaiah at Vidhana Soudha on Monday, marking the inauguration of the service.

 However, till late in the evening, the Pink Hoysalas received only 20 calls and none of them were about women in distress. In fact, most of the calls were from those downloading the Suraksha (Save Our Soul) app set up by Bengaluru police for women. Also, of the 15 app downloads, only five were by women. Veena had to respond to those downloading the app and accept their calls on a tablet.
 
 A team from TOI took a ride in Veena’s Hosyala (No. 224). Like the other 221 Hoysalas, the Pink Hoysalas too are equipped with internet-enabled tablets with Google Maps installed in them. 
 
 Veena and her two colleagues in the van explained how the system works. Those wanting to contact Pink Hoysala staff directly should download the Suraksha app. Others can reach them by dialling 100 and explaining that the call relates to crime against women. On receiving a call, the control room will alert the nearest Pink Hoysala, directing it to head to the crime scene. SOS calls for help from the app will be automatically routed to the nearest Pink Hoysala.
 
 “Whenever a complaint is made, the tablet displays a new window explaining the nature of the call, details of the caller and the location. First, we press the ‘accepted’ button on the screen. Once we leave for the place, we press the second button, ‘on action’. On reaching the spot, we press the third button, ‘at scene’. Finally, when the issue is resolved, we press the ‘closed’ button,” explained the staff.
 
 Police commissioner Praveen Sood said he has directed Pink Hoysala staffers to focus on places like women’s hostels, paying guest accommodations, temples and educational institutions where women are often targeted by criminal elements. “The Pink Hoysalas will be stationed at these spots and will be patrolling the surrounding areas,” he said, adding, “In case of an emergency, more women cops will be called.” 
 
 Conspicuous by absence
 
 On Monday, social media saw red over the absence of women form the dias at the inauguration of the Pink Hoysalas. The 51 vehicles were flagged off by the CM in front of Vidhana Soudha. “Where are the women on the stage?” said a Facebook comment. “You could not accommodate even a single woman on the dais?” commented a Twitter user.
