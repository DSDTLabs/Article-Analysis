MUMBAI: Exerting pressure on the civic body, tainted garbage contractors have threatened to stop picking up garbage from January 27 if the authorities did not withdraw complaints against them. 

 The city generates 7,100 tonnes of garbage daily, most of which is collected and transported by these contractors. The threat comes in the wake of   announcing it was likely to reissue the tender for the Rs1,800 crore garbage collection-transportation contract for the third time as most of those who participated in the second round were tainted.
 
 Corporators alleged the administration was going soft on these unscrupulous contractors. They said BMC officials had only submitted written complaints against the contractors to the police, but no follow-up was done. They alleged the contractors, in connivance with civic officials, were adopting pressure tactics in a bid to participate in the new tending process, for which BMC was getting poor response.
 
 The BMC pays contractors based on garbage weight which is measured when vehicles enter dumping grounds. In the past, contractors were found mixing debris with garbage to increase its weight.
 
 BMC had appointed nine contractors in 2012. Though their contracts expired in 2017, the civic body was unable to appoint a new contractor. Hence, it allowed them to continue. However, there is growing political pressure on the BMC not to allow these tainted contractors to participate in the new bidding process.
 
 All the contractors submitted separate letters to the BMC earlier this week stating the complaints against them were false.   leader in the   said, "The situation has arisen because the administration did not take a decision on the issue for long. Either they should be blacklisted or the notices against them withdrawn."
 
 Opposition leader in the BMC and Congress corporator   said, "The administration needs to take a firm stand and not give in to the threats."
