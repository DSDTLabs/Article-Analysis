CHANDIGARH: Two terminally ill patients got a new lease of life after the family of a deceased 55-year-old Mehar Singh from Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, donated his organs in PGI. 

 On 15 May, Mehar, while working at a construction site, suddenly slipped to have a fatal fall and lost conscious. Mehar was rushed to a nearby hospital where doctors referred him to PGI.
 
 The next day, Mehar was brought to PGI in an extremely critical condition. On May 17, he was declared brain dead after two meetings conducted by the Brain Death Certification Committee.
 
 Mehar's wife   said, "We did not know anything about organ donation, but once we understood that our decision can help save many lives, we decided to go ahead. The only thought in our minds was that our decision may turn beneficial for someone else and that person could get more time to spend with his/her dear ones."
 
 Both the recipients were suffering from debilitating kidney ailments and the only way for them to survive was through a transplant. 
 
 "My family member got another shot at life only because of the brave decision made by Mehar Singh's family. I can never thank them enough for this noble deed," said the relative of the recipients.
