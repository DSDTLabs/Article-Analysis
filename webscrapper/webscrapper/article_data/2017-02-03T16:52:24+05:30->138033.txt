Talking about his association with Vineet, Ramman tells, "Vineet Raina and I have been friends for many years but we were not in touch as usual in the dream city  's always busy and hectic life, it was some event we attended together a year back where we had a long chat and since then we have been in touch frequently." So in what capacity Vineet Raina is joining your company? "When I spoke to Vineet Raina recently and shared my vision regarding production under Natak Ent., Vineet was really excited and happy about it. We had a discussion on the concepts and subjects which I was working on and he gave me valuable and creative inputs. Vineet also shared that he has always been into writing stories and poetry but could never explore his that part of talent due to his busy schedules, so we thought we can work together and come up with more creative stuff. Like the saying goes 
 ." Ramman feels being an actor actually helps in production but it is at the same time very different. Lastly Ramman adds, "Vineet and I are more than brothers than friends, our vision and thoughts match and the important thing is the Trust Factor between us."
