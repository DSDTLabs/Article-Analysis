MUMBAI: Bombay high court directed   not to proceed with demolition of a one-storey building and chawl on S V Road, Andheri (W), for road-widening.

 
 A bench headed by Justice Abhay Oka and   recently heard a petition by its occupants, including 17 shop-owners who challenged a February 3 notice by K-west ward office to vacate their portion of the structures, saying they have been tenants of   and   for over 80 years.
 
 Their petition stated that they first received notices in 2016 to remove their portions falling in the alignment of the proposed widening of 90 feet of S V Road as part of the building and chawl had to be demolished. They were also told to prove the authenticity of their structures. They then got notices on February 3, 2018, to vacate. On March 16, BMC started taking measurements demarcating portions affected by the proposed road line.
 
 The tenants moved the HC, saying BMC should either compensate them as per market value or give them alternative accommodation within 500 metres.
 
 Their advocate,  , argued that the notices were issued under sections of BMC Act with regard to setback of building to align with road and acquisition of land occupied by structures. He said BMC had not fulfilled its statutory obligation before giving a notice to vacate the structures.
 
 The judges, in their interim order, said it appears that both sections “are not applicable as there are structures in existence”.
 
 The bench has posted the hearing on June 6 but directed that demolition should not be undertaken on the basis of the February 3 notice.
