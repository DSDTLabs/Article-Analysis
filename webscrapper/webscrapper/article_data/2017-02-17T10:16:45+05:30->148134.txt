NEW DELHI: AAP chief Arvind   yesterday trolled Prime Minister   on Twitter saying he looked "nervous" at his state elections' campaign rallies.

 
  
  
 
 PM Modi spoke at an election rally in Uttar Pradesh yesterday. He tweeted parts of his speech from the rally. And Kejriwal responded to one of those tweets. The AAP leader was implying that the PM and the BJP are "nervous" about the results of the polls in five states. While Kejriwal's AAP isn't contesting the polls in UP, he is, this time around, trying to make inroads into Punjab and Goa.
 
 
 
  
 
 Five states are going or have gone to the polls this month. Polls were recently concluded in Punjab, Goa and Uttarakhand. They are underway in UP and coming up soon in Manipur. The results of all the polls will be announced March 11.
 
 
 Modi's rally yesterday was in Hardoi in UP. Hardoi votes on Sunday in the third phase of the staggered elections in the state. 
 
 Even without AAP contesting the race in UP, it appears the race will be tight with the BJP, the SP-Congress alliance and the   being the main parties in the fray.
 
 " ,  , Bahujan Samaj Party never thought about the bigger picture. All they did was to serve a select few, guided by political calculations. The fortune of the state cannot be changed until it gets rid of these political parties," Modi said at yesterday's rally.
