PATNA: The state government on Friday assured the legislative council that it will consider converting Patna-based   into a music university.

 Responding to a non-government resolution brought by JD (U) member  , public health engineering department (PHED) minister   (who was replying on behalf of art, culture and youth affairs department minister) said the Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir (BNKL) is an autonomous body run on the basis of grants provided by the art, culture and youth affairs department.
 
 When the minister informed the House that there was no proposal at present to convert BNKL into a music university, Rai pointed out since the state’s development commissioner happens to be chairperson of the BNKL governing body and the finance secretary one of its members, the institution cannot be considered as an autonomous body. “The BNKL functions like a government institution. Moreover, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, in his Budget speech for FY 2009-10, had made an announcement regarding conversion of this institution into a music university,” Rai said.
 
 Rai argued that the state has no music university and those pursuing art and dance courses have no other option but to depend on the Allahabad-based Prayag  . Later, minister Jha inform the House that the government will seriously consider Rai’s proposal.
