HYDERABAD: Two sisters from the city, who were allegedly tortured by their female employer in Saudi Arabia, have been rescued and they returned home. The two sisters -  , 24, and  , 25, were helped by Manjula Manikantan, a volunteer from Kerala, who coordinated with the Indian Embassy in   to rescue the sisters. After suffering for two years in Saudi Arabia, the rescued women urged people not to fall prey to the promises of agents providing jobs in Saudi Arabia. "We were treated inhumanly and were tortured physically and mentally. They have no humanity," the sisters said in a video message. 

 Sana Sultana and Shameem Sultana were told that they will work as beauticians in Qatif. However, their female employer allegedly used to lock them in a room after work to prevent them from venturing out or meeting anyone. Following the harassment at the hands of their employer, the sisters reportedly attempted suicide. They were taken to a hospital, form where Qatif police took them into custody.
 
 On learning about the plight of the two women, the Qatif police contacted Manjula Manikantan, who filed a case at Dammam labour court, so that the women could be freed from the clutches of their sponsor. However, the sponsor also filed a case against the women at Qatif court. As the issue failed to settle, the matter was reported to Indian Embassy in  , which rescued the women and helped them return home.
 
 On Sunday, MBT leader Amjedullah Khan said, "George and Layakath Ali of Indian Embassy and Unni Poochedi, Shaji, Mathilakam, Shibu Kumar, Navayhugam, Abraham, Valiya Kala and Mirza Baig Zaheer along with Manjula Manikantan, provided financial assistance to the two women."
