PUNE: A major fire gutted the office of a direct-to-home (D2H) service provider on the first floor of a building on   near   around 6.30am on Tuesday.

 
  
  
 Fire brigade officials are trying to ascertain what caused the blaze. There was no power supply at the office when the fire broke out. Heat generated inside the server room may have caused the fire, the officials said.
 
 A security guard had informed the central fire brigade control room about the incident. Minutes after receiving the information, a water tender from the   fire station arrived at the spot and began the firefighting operation.
 
 However, the magnitude of the fire was such that three more tenders, including one from Erandawana and central fire brigade, had to be brought in.
 
 Kothrud fire station officer Gajanan   said, “Since the door and windows of the office were locked, we used ladders for spraying water. However, we didn’t get the desired results at first. Thick black fumes started emanating from the office after we asked the guard to open the door. As many as 22 firemen wearing breathing apparatus entered into the office and opened the windows. The fire was completely doused by 8.30am.”
 
 Electric wires, furniture, computers and documents were destroyed in the blaze, Patrudkar added.
 
 The service provider’s office was locked when a TOI reporter reached there to meet the authorities for comments.
