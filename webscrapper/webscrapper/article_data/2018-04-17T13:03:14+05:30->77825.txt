GAYA: Gaya Municipal Corporation is now considering the proposal to outsource its revenue collection. Officials claimed that the civic body, has to first short list and then finalise the agency for outsourcing the   mechanism. 

 Confirming the move to outsource tax collection mechanism, mayor   said a final decision in this regard is yet to be taken. “It is likely to be rolled out in a couple of months,” said the mayor. Asked about the action taken against revenue employees who have pocketed the money collected by them, the mayor said salary of defaulting employees has been withheld. 
 
 “Incidence of collectors pocketing the money collected from non-holding sources like   cattle fair have been reported in the past but in the absence of effective deterrents, the practice continues,” said sources. Besides holding tax, the civic body earns revenue from   market auction, cattle fair, private bus stand, auto stand and parking slots among others. 
 
 As against an estimated revenue of Rs 13 crore in the financial year 2017-18, the actual receipt has been only Rs 8.31 crore, which is less than 65% of the target revenue.  , a former member of the standing committee of Gaya Municipal Corporation (GMC) said, the number of unregistered holdings in the corporation area is not less than 10,000. 
 
 “These holdings have been in existence for decades but little has been done to bring them in the tax net. Without paying any tax, the owners of these holdings enjoy services like door to door collection of municipal waste, sweeping of the streets and unauthorised tap water connection,” said Prasad.
