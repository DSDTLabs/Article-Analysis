NEW DELHI: The Centre feels that while it might be "wiser" for   to wait till the SC delivers its verdict on her DA case, it will not stand in the way if the   seeks her installation as CM. 

 The view in the Centre is that it is for AIADMK to decide if it wants to go ahead with   being sworn in as CM and face the consequences in the event the apex court delivers an adverse verdict in the case. 
 
 While the swearing-in is seen as AIADMK's business,   governor C   Rao is examining precedents and taking note of the expected SC ruling in the case involving Sasikala and the late J  . 
 
 The possibility of Sasikala being sworn in as CM in the next two days seems dim with the governor unlikely to be available in Chennai as he is on scheduled visits to Mumbai and Bengaluru over the next two days. 
 
 The governor may take note of events in the Tansi land case where Jayalalithaa had to step down as chief minister after the SC disqualified her in 2001. Then governor Fathima Beevi's decision to swear her in after the 2001 state elections despite conviction by a lower court had attracted criticism. The SC finally acquitted Jayalalithaa in the case in 2003.
