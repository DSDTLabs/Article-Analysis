NEW DELHI: A major part of Rs 87-crore   Bharat   given to north and east   remain   even though these two corporations are cash-strapped and struggle to generate funds for even the basic expenses. 

 According to a Delhi government report, north corporation had utilised only 22% of the Rs 46 crore as on December 31, 2017, while the east corporation spent 53% of its share of Rs 41 crore. The funds had come from both the Centre and the Delhi government. 
 
 “For spending on building toilets, and creating awareness and capacity building, the corporations needed only planning and execution and nothing else,” said an official. However, for solid waste management, the corporations needed to make 56% contribution to the funds. 
 
 The corporations haven’t bothered to create awareness about the sanitation mobile applications they had launched on December 29 last year. That’s why these continue to be extremely ineffective. 
 
 Both north and east corporations had recently claimed an open defecation-free status. But rampant open defection continues and officials of both corporations are aware of this. Yet funds weren’t spent on creating awareness. 
 
 Officials in both corporations, however, claimed that by December 31 last year, funds had been earmarked under different heads. “Around 80% funds have been utilised recently, but utilisation certificates haven’t been shared with the government. We will do that soon,” said a north corporation official. 
 
 East corporation also claimed that it has spent around 75% of the funds and would submit a report to the government on it soon. Unspent Swachh funds are transferred.
