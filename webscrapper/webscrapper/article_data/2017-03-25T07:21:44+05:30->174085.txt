AHMEDABAD: Rumours of   villages on the outskirts of the city at night is haunting   again. However, this time, cops have woken up early and have issued a clarification that messages — attributed to cops — doing the rounds on   are fake. 

  said that the messages talk of a band of about 15 to 20 armed robbers (apparently including women) roaming through Naroda, Memco, Narol, Kalupur, and Sardarnagar. The messages say that the sound of a child crying is also heard in these areas at night. 
 
 “The messages were being circulated on the social media,” said a senior police official. 
 
 “However, we have not circulated any such message. Patrolling in these areas continues and no such gang is on the prowl. So, we urge people not to believe such messages and to avoid forwarding them.” A couple of years ago, similar rumours had stoked fear in villages and areas located on the outskirts of the city. 
 
 They led to three deaths in Gandhinagar and  , where residents had beaten to death innocent persons suspecting them to be robbers.
