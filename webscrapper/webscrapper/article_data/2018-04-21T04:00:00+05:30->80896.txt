Surat: After Ahmedabad crime branch officials cracked the sensational rape and murder case of an 11-year old girl and her mother, city police commissioner Satish Sharma broke his day-long silence in the evening and claimed that the local police had initially collected the closed circuit television (CCTV) footages. “Initial CCTV footage was collected by the local police and experts from Vadodara were called in to develop them further, which led to investigators getting the registration number of vehicle used by criminals to dump the body. Forensic help was also taken at that time,” he told TOI. However, the local police did not take the CCTV footage probe forward, which could have helped them reach the culprits, It also must be noted, however, that the Surat police intensifed its probe only after nearly nine days when there was massive uproar over the case along with the gangrapes in Kathua and Unnao.  Sharma also said that Andhra Pradesh man, who claimed to be the girl’s father, has been proved wrong after the blood group reports. Though father’s blood group was O, the victim girl’s B. Police have also decided to increase the number of CCTV cameras in some areas. Sharma said that around 200-300 new cameras would added to the present network of 604 for better surveillance. He also said that mobile patrolling vans in areas like Pandesara, Sachin and Sachin GIDC will be enhanced and eight new patrol vans would be deployed.
