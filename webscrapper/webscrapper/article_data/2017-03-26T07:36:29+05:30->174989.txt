NEW DELHI: The   (AAP), on Saturday, wrote to the  , alleging large-scale rigging and tampering of EVMs in Punjab and demanding  .   said his party analysed the booth-wise voting pattern and concluded that electronic voting machines were tampered with. There is “clear and irrefutable evidence of manipulation of results at polling booths”, he alleged.

 “In the interest of justice, transparency and fair play, AAP appealed to the EC that results of all polling booths, where voter verification paper audit trail (VVPAT) had been deployed, be cross-verified/cross-checked with the paper trail so that the cloud looming over the use of EVMs is settled and the faith of the common man in the electoral process is restored,” Gupta said.
 
 He said the initial analysis showed that at several booths, where AAP secured very few votes, voters, in much bigger numbers than the total number of votes secured by the party, said they voted for the party. “These people are ready to file affidavits to support their claim. They are shocked their votes were either not counted as votes to AAP or were transferred to other parties by EVM tampering,” Gupta said.
 
 “The ECI is the sentinel in preservation of sanctity of the electoral process and we have requested they cross-check the paper audit trail of the results generated through EVMs at all polling booths where VVPATs were deployed in Punjab to resolve the glaring inconsistencies in the results,” he said.
 
 Delhi chief minister  , on March 15, said manipulation of EVMs may have led to AAP's poor showing in Punjab. He said it could be part of a conspiracy to keep the party out of power in the state.
 
 The AAP chief said his party would approach the poll panel in this regard. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati also alleged tampering of EVMs in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.
