NAVI MUMBAI: Disability is only a state of mind, this phrase has been proved right by a clerk from Karjat Panchayat, Samithi Panmand. The 50-year-old not only participated in a trekking competition that was held at   on Sunday, but also managed to complete it by reaching the top. The event was organised to mark the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekanand.

 Panmand gave the other participants a complex by taking a flight of 1,600 steps and that too just on one leg. With the support of a crutch, Panmand’s determination left others sweat it out. 
 
 The first time he had participated in a marathon was in 1987, which he had won. He then walked to Vaishnodevi shrine in 2010 and then participated in a trekking competition to Shivneri in 2007. Panmand took an hour to reach the finish line this time. 
 
 The middle-aged man has been suffering from a short left leg since childhood. He lives along with his wife and three children who encourage and support him in his adventurous journey.
 
 Inspired by his achievement the second runners’ up winner handed over his prize to Panmand. “My interest in trekking and mountaineering started after participating in a marathon organized by the army in 1987 in Pune. Since then there has been no looking back. Now, my target is to reach Mount Everest,” said Panmand.
 
 Dipak Shinde, a Mahad resident, who witnessed the event, said, “We were surprised to see him crossing over 1,600 steps within an hour. He will be felicitated in a program that will be held to observe the death anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.”
