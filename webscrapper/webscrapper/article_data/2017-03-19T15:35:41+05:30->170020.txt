 recently found himself in the eye of a storm after a video of him shouting at a fan surfaced. Apparently, a fan touched him to which he reacted by hitting him and shouting at him. On online media, a wave of disapproval had risen against Tovino, with people calling him arrogant. "He is just one film old and yet acts like a star,' went some of the comments. The actor seemed to have cooled down, for he has apologised for the incident, in a facebook post. 

 "I'm one among you and like you," begins the post. "With every character I only wish to get good reviews from you. I'm well aware that My existence is dependent on people who love cinema to death. Something bad happened in the meantime. While expressing their love, a fan injured me and I reacted. If that has hurt anyone, I apologise. I was just being human, not because I am arrogant. Good films and characters will survive in the long run. The rest, time will prove.
 
 Tovino's Mexican Aparatha has been getting good reviews at the box office.
