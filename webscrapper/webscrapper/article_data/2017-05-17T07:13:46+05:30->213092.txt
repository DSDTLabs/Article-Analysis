JALANDHAR: A 17-year-old student of   College for  ,  , has gone missing, with her family alleging it was due to ragging. The girl went missing after a video was posted on social media, apparently by a college student, in which one girl was seen assaulting her. 

 Unfortunately, some more students are supporting the assailant girl, instead of coming to the rescue of the victim, who appears to be at the receiving end. Her family alleged that the girl was missing for the past three days. Initially, they thought she would have gone to   to one of their relatives, but later they realized she was missing.
 
 HMV principal   said it was a case of a scuffle between two girls, and not of ragging. Division No.2 station house officer (SHO)   said that prima facie, it appeared to be a case of dispute between two girls. He said it seemed the girl felt further humiliated, as her video was posted on social media. He said they were already working to trace the missing girl.
