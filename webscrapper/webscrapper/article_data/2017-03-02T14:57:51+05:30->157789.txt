BHUBANESWAR: The anti-Mandal commission riots of the 90s are still fresh in the mind of Hariram Bedi, a retired bus driver of the state-owned Odisha state road transport corporation (OSRTC). So are his years of suffering, government's neglect and unfulfilled promise of the late   Patnaik that the leader reportedly made to reward Bedi for his bravery during the protests. 

 "The whole country was on the edge during the agitation and so was Odisha. I drove the bus with around 30 passengers from   to Angul on the night of August 31, 1990. Protesters attacked our bus (OIC-6204). I was injured. But I safely transported the passengers. Biju babu came to know about the incident and felicitated me at a public function in Deogarh in 1992," said Bedi, a resident of  's Bamra. Bedi said Biju babu had also announced to name the bus after him (Hariram).
 
 "On the dais, Biju babu wrote the letter and asked his officials to ensure I get Rs 1 lakh annually. But I have not received any benefit till date," said Bedi, who retired from OSRTC in May 2010.
 
 Carrying a letter, supposedly written by Patnaik, Bedi has been running from pillar to post to get some financial assistance from chief minister  . In the letter, copy of which is with the TOI, it is written that Bedi is Biju Patnaik's son and would be given Rs 1 lakh assistance every year. 
 
 Bedi said his seven-member family has been struggling to eke out its living due to neglect by the government officials. "For past several years, I have been meeting senior officials of home, transport and general administration departments. But nobody is addressing my issue," Bedi said. "We are verifying the authenticity of the signature of late Biju Patnaik in the letter. Bedi recently gave a memorandum along with the letter in the chief minister's grievance cell, seeking fulfilment of Biju babu's promises," a home department officer told TOI.
