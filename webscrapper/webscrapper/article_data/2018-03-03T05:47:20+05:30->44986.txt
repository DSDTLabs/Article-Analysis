KOLKATA: For the 307   working at the   office, this was the worst Holi in their career - the first time that their salaries didn't get deposited even till March 2. 

 Most staff members have been tense. More so because there have been reports of the information and broadcasting ministry having refused to release funds for the salaries of its employees. Many have feared that the ongoing friction between Prasar Bharati and I&B ministry has taken a toll on the salaries at AIR Kolkata. 
 
 However, Suchismita Roy, director engineering and head of office, AIR Kolkata, dispelled such rumours. According to her, the employees are expected to get their salaries on Saturday. "Nowadays, the staff is paid their salary via a computerised process. After the ministry releases a Letter Of Credit (LOC), it takes 24 hours for the bank to process it. Since banks had a holiday on March 1, it is taking time to process it. However, something like this had happened last October as well," she said.
 
 "That was because of the teething problems of the new computerised system. But that was sorted out. Why did it resurface now? This time, this salary problem is definitely related to the current controversy between the ministry and  . That the bank would be shut for Holi on March 1 was a known fact. Why did the LOC get released so late?" an insider asked.
