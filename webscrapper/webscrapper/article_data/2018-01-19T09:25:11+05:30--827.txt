BENGALURU: The Bangalore Development Authority called it an oversight. Urban experts said it was deliberate. Whatever the case, the  's master plan 2031 could spell disaster for lakes if it is implemented as it stands. 

  The BDA has drawn up roads bang on top of lakebeds in at least four places in the city, the draft master plan's district maps show. The documents, accessed by TOI , show lakes in   and Doddabanalli (near KR Puram) and   and Siddapura (near  ) could be destroyed if the plan comes to fruition. 
 
  In Chimmasandra and Doddabanalli villages, for example, a 12-metre-wide road is marked right on the lake, provisional planning district map (No. 23B1) shows. The planning district map (No. 11B2) shows it is a similar case with the lakes in Kundalahalli and Siddapura. 
 
  An official with the BDA's town planning wing brushed it aside as an oversight. "There is little chance this was done intentionally," he said. "It's a provisional master plan, and errors will be rectified in the final version. We want the public and experts to file objections and suggestions to the master plan and bring them to our notice. We are open to objections and suggestions till January 23." 
 
 One urban expert was unwilling to give BDA the benefit of the doubt. "Given its record on master plans, the authority cannot commit such blunders even if it is provisional," said Diwakar K, a social activist and resident of  . "It is eminently possible that the lake could be destroyed in the name of development or to help self-interested groups. If one studies the master plan in detail, more such cases could emerge."
 
 Diwakar, an urban expert, said the BDA must fix such blunders in the final master plan. "The authority should ensure the provisional plan is a clean document which gives scope for suggestions and improvement. We should not be dealing with such major errors," he said.
