PATNA: Maintenance of bulletproof Ambassador cars of Bihar government, which even chief minister   use, has become difficult due to non-availability of proper spare parts of the iconic vehicle. The Kolkata-based Hindustan Motors had stopped production of once the go-to vehicle of ministers and bureaucrats almost three years ago. 

 Spare parts are being purchased from open market without any guarantee to keep at least eight of these 1.5 tonne vehicles moving. Apart from Ambassador cars, two bulletproof   vehicles are also being used by the state government temporarily.
 
 “All these Ambassador cars have crossed their time period, but are still being used due to lack of alternative. Of the 25 bulletproof fleet of Ambassador cars with state government, one is of 2013 model, 18 are of 2009 model and six of 2005 model.
 
 “Finding spare parts for the Ambassador cars has become difficult. Around eight vehicles are in running condition. Of them, two are being used by the CM,” said a source who looks after these vehicles. He said a back-up Ambassador car always accompanies the CM’s cavalcade.
 
 “There is only one authorised dealer for Ambassador spare parts in Patna. The spares which the dealer fails to provide are being purchased from open market even if they are not original,” said a source, adding even for the tyres of these cars, the government is dependent on   (BSF), which supply the same from Delhi. “We can place orders for a minimum 15 tyres at a time,” he added.
 
 Last year, the state police headquarters had also enhanced the security of CM by asking the   personnel to guard him with more than hundred rounds of ammunitions with themselves.
 
 IG (provision)   said Tata Motors is yet to deliver six new bulletproof Safaris to the state government which were to be replaced by the old fleet. “These new vehicles were scheduled for delivery in November last year,” he added.
