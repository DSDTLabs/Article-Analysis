NEW DELHI. This story is quite filmy, but without a happy ending. Ghaziabad-based friends became foes when they both fell in love with the same woman. The love triangle ended with the woman left bereft of both suitors. 

 
  It all began when Aamir asked good friend Sameer to pretend to get close to his girlfriend to see if she's loyal. Aamir gave Sameer her phone number. After chatting with and meeting the girl a few times, Sameer began developing feelings for her. 
 
  In the midst of all this, Aamir had to go to Tihar Jail on December 25 last year for a case against him under the Arms Act. Sameer would often visit Aamir in jail with Aamir's girlfriend. Seeing the growing chemistry between them, Aamir asked Sameer to stay away from her. The two then had a heated argument on the jail premises, following which Sameer left but continued to meet Aamir’s lover.
 
  After getting out of jail on January 7, Aamir went straight to his girlfriend and confronted her. On going though the messages on her phone, Aamir confirmed that she and Sameer had indeed got quite close to each other while he was in jail.
 
 An enraged Aamir immediately called up Sameer and both decided to meet on the same night to settle the matter. Sameer along with his aide Salman reached the spot where Aamir was eventually murdered. 
 
  As per Special Sub-Inspector Santosh Kumar, Sameer had made up his mind to marry Aamir’s girlfriend and wanted to eliminate Aamir. Sameer was helped by a common friend Salman. Sameer purchased a country-made pistol for Rs 3000 and used that to shoot Aamir in the head.
 
  Both Sameer and Salman were apprehended by Ghaziabad police from Bhoodgarhi last Sunday. Police officials claim that the two confessed to their crime.
