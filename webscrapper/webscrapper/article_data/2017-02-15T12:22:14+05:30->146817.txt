VADODARA: The police are yet to get any break-through in finding a five-year-old girl, who was kidnapped by an unidentified man from   in Gorwa on February 11.

 The victim, who lived in a nearby slum dwelling, was playing with her elder brother in the temple on February 11 evening. The police said that her father has alleged in the complaint that a man aged around 40 years came to the temple and lured the girl by promising to buy her snacks from a shop outside the temple.
 
 When the complainant went to the temple to fetch his children, the boy told him that the girl went with a man who had worn a green shawl to buy snack outside the temple. He searched the temple premises and outside for his daughter but could not find her. After searching the victim for a day, the man registered the complaint at   on February 12.
 
 The police said that they have formed a team and activated their informers to search the man and the victim. “I have also asked constables from our police station to patrol in the area and search suspicious locations in civil dress,” said   inspector  .
 
 Shrimali added that the temple premises or the shops outside the temple did not have CCTV cameras so it will be difficult to identify the accused. “However, we have the girl’s photograph so it will help us in some way,” he said.
 
 The victim’s parents work as construction labourers in the city and are natives of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. They visit the city during the employment season.
