MUMBAI: In a week’s time, city police will come up with guidelines for schools to ensure that there is no repeat of the   tragedy in Mumbai. 

 In the wake of the national outrage over a seven-year-old’s murder in the school’s washroom in Gurgaon, police commissioner   said on Wednesday that cops will soon issue safety guidelines for city schools.
 
 “We have already started a drive called ‘Police Didi’ where women constables visit schools within their respective jurisdiction and sensitise kids on sexual harassment. The exercise has been a success and due to this awareness, several such crimes have been prevented. Now, we will issue guidelines to schools on similar lines,” said Padsalgikar and added that these norms will be discussed with parent-teacher associations.
 
 Police said the guidelines require schools to install CCTVs inside their premises. Also, cops will conduct background checks of their staff, especially bus conductors, peons, drivers and even some male teachers, to ensure that they don’t have any criminal antecedents. Schools will also have to hire guards to monitor any unauthorized entry into their premises. 
 
 The guidelines already mandate the presence of a woman attendant in a school bus till the last child is dropped. 
 
 City police is also considering a plan to ask schools to follow a “buddy system” where two schoolchildren visit the washroom together. “The other alternative is to deploy guards outside washrooms,” said an official.
