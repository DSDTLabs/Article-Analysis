Canacona: Inundation of some areas, especially along the taluka’s major rivers— Galgibaga and Talpona, and disruption of power due to crashing of trees on electricity lines and other rain-related problems hit normal life in Canacona. The electricity department reported that power lines were damaged in several places and estimated the loss at Rs 2.5 lakh, said junior engineer Govind Bhat. The fire and emergency services department received 33 calls since Tuesday night. The local office has 12 workers round the clock and five workers provided by Canacona municipality. But people complained that the fire fighting personnel do not reach the spot on time during an emergency. The vehicle supplied to the fire services is old and breaks down often. Janardhan Bhandari, a local activist, urged the department to provide better services to the people in emergencies by increasing manpower and deploying a new vehicle. The widening of NH 17 through Galgibaga and Talpona has created huge piles of debris along roads causing waterlogging .
