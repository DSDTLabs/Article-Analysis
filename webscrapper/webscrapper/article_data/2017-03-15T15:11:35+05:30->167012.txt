Like every year, 
  celebrated his birthday on March 14, with friends from the media and a few fans at his residence. Aamir, who turned 52, was in a great mood and answered all questions posed to him.   also wished Mr. Perfectionist, however what caught everyone's attention was SRK's visit to   at his residence.

 Yes! You read it right. The Baadshah of Bollywood made sure that he met Aamir Khan on his birthday and exchange pleasantries. According to reports, 
  had invited Aamir at his residence ‘Mannat’ for dinner, but since that didn’t happen, SRK dropped in at Aamir and Kiran’s Bandra residence at the wee hours in the morning. That's pleasant, isn't it?
 
  
  
 Aamir while talking about SRK's dinner invite clarified that they both were meeting just as friends and nothing work related would be discussed. SRK and Aamir recently caught up in Dubai at businessman Ajay Bijli's birthday celebration and a picture of the two of them soon went viral.
