AHMEDABAD: Residents of Juhapura, from all walks of life, on Sunday congregated to discuss how they felt neglected when it came to civic amenities. With the municipal corporation suggesting more sewage farms be constructed in areas nearby Juhapura while issues like water, roads and drainage remain unaddressed, residents demanded a separate ward or assembly constituency for the largest minority ghetto. 

 The meeting, “Juhapura ki Guftegu” , was held at Crescent school in Juhapura. A number of residents demanded removal of proposed sewerage plant from   adjacent to Juhapura.
 
 Kauserali Syed, the organizer of the programme, said that people in Juhapura cannot sleep at night due to the smell coming from the sewerage plant in Pirana. What will be their condition when the sewerage plant starts functioning in Juhapura, Syed asked.
 
 “It will not be just Juhapura, but residents of Vasna and   will also be affected,” said Syed.
 
 Syed went on to add that Juhapura is neglected when it comes to basic civic amenities. “We don’t have proper roads and drainage system in an area which houses about 4 lakh residents,” Syed said.
 
 Syed claimed that Juhapura is bigger in both area and population than many assembly constituencies. “If they cannot provide basic amenities to the people of Juhapura, declare it an assembly constituency. We will elect our own representative and spend the budget for welfare of the area,” he said.
 
 Other speakers on the podium like   of Jamiyat-e- Islami also pressed on the need for basic civic amenities in Juhapura. Water logging in monsoon, overflowing gutters, drinking water scarcity and damaged roads are the main difficulties faced by Juhapura residents.
