HYDERABAD: Stating that if man encroaches lakes and fills them with concrete buildings, one day nature would fill them with water and revert them to their original status, a division bench of the   on Thursday said it would review the number of lakes and tanks in Hyderabad of the past and their current status.

 The bench of   T   said this while hearing a batch of pleas filed for and against GO 111, issued in 1996, banning constructions within 10km radius of   and Osmansagar. The bench asked all the advocates to come prepared on Feb 15 for a fullfledged hearing on how effectively this GO was implemented in the last two decades and to examine the rationale behind the pleas for scrapping this GO on the ground that it is impeding development in 84 villages near the lakes.
 
 The bench reminded advocates of how Chennai is struggling to return to normalcy after last year's inundation. This was a result of disappearance of 90% of tanks in the city to pave way for a concrete jungle. 
 
 Replying to a query,   counsel   told the court that they have no intention of recalling GO 111. However, a committee was set up to conduct a scientific survey on the impact of the GO on 84 villages, he said, adding that the committee is yet to file its report. 
 
 The petitioner's counsel said that though the state plays a major role in the matter, it did not file its counter for years. He also charged the authorities with forming the committee with an ulterior motive of deleting certain villages from the purview of GO 111.
