GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani while speaking at the Panchayat Sarpanch Samelan (gathering) after felicitating the newly elected Sarpanchas told that, “like the recent results in the village Panchayat elections and other municipalities   will win 2/3rd majority in the upcoming assembly elections.”

 Targeting   vice president Rahul Gandhi, Rupani said,“Rahul Gandhi held a public gathering in Mehsana village where the BJP backed Sarpanch have won. Likewise in most of the villages influenced by the Congress leaders of Gujarat BJP backed Sarpanch and members have won. We hope that Gujarat Congress asks Rahul Gandhi to be resident of Gujarat so Congress can be wiped out completely from Gujarat.”
 
 Rupani claimed that, “People of the country have supported PM Narendra Modi’s demonetisation move and the results of the local bodies across the country in favour of BJP is the proof of that. PM Narendra Modi through various schemes started funding schemes for poor, middle class and needy. Farmers' interst burden have been waived off, women, senior citizens all have benefited from the PM’s move.”
 
 Rupani also said that the state government will implement the Panchayats Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act shortly.
 
 State BJP president Jitu Vaghani told that, “Congress tried to mislead the rural people but the results in favour of BJP is clear befitting reply to Congress propaganda.”
 
 He said, “Despite Congress and opposition’s propaganda people have supported demonetisation to control black money, corruption and terrorism. From the PM’s decision poor, homeless, women, small traders, MSME industry all have benefited.”
