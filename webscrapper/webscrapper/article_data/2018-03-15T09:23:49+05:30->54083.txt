 Afoul odour has been emanating from the Hussainsagar for the past four months after a road caved in on   and a sewer line belonging to the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) burst near NTR garden, resulting in the flow of sewage water into the lake.
 
 With the municipal administration department deciding to immediately arrest the leakage of sewage water into the lake, HMWS&SB kicked off repairs and diversion of sewage line works, which were completed a couple of days ago.
 
 “We have invited global tenders not only to arrest the foul smell emanating from the lake but also algal blooms. The agencies applying for the job will have to use the latest technology and control the smell within 16 days. An expert committee comprising agencies like EPTRI (Environment Protection Training and Research Institute) will look into the technology the companies plan to deploy and give clearances for awarding the contract,” HMDA metropolitan commissioner   told TOI.
 
 HMDA has already conducted a pre-bid meeting with 12 firms that evinced interest in taking up the work and its officials explained the present status of the Hussainsagar. The commissioner said on the request of the agencies, the last date for submission of bids has been extended to March 29.
 
 Chiranjeevulu said the successful bidder will have to commence work immediately after the Letter of Acceptance (LOA) is issued and the process of treatment will have to be completed and odour should be controlled from the 16th day onwards.
