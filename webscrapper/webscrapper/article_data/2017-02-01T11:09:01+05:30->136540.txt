PANAJI: Senior Congress functionary Randeep Singh   has admitted that the party’s failure to pass the legislature to give Goa special status played a role in losing the mandate in the 2012 state assembly polls. The Congress government was in power from 2007 to 2012 in Goa with the UPA at the Centre. 

 “I think that is why we lost power in 2012 election. There were gaps in delivery and that led to our defeat. We have corrected those gaps. We have brought in fresh commitment. We will persuade the government of India to grant the state special status,” Surjewala said.
 
 Reacting to defence minister Manohar Parrikar’s statement that Goa does not need special status, Surjewala said that the comments showcase the two-faced BJP government. 
 
 “We may not have the majority in the Lok Sabha right now but a bill can also be generated as a private members bill in the Rajya Sabha,” he said. 
 
 Commenting on the selective nature of the Aam Aadmi Party to contest the elections, Surjewala accused Arvind Kejriwal of working to divide Congress votes and his party being the B-team of the BJP.
 
  Surjewala said his party will shut down all kinds of casinos if voted to power.
