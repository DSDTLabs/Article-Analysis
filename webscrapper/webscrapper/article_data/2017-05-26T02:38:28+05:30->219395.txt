NEW DELHI: A 20-year-old youth was caught when he tried to break into an ATM near   in northwest Delhi. His earlier attempts to break into another ATM a week ago had caused an alarm to go off, due to which he had to abandon the plan.

 Police said that Manish required about Rs 3 lakh to fund his wedding, but could arrange for Rs 96,500 after he had burgled an electronics showroom in Prashant Vihar last month. Desperate to arrange for the balance amount, Manish asked his friends Ankit and Vishnu for help. Two other friends were asked to keep an eye outside the ATM.
 
 On Tuesday night, they reached a   at Shakurpur to remove the cash box from the dispensing machine. However, a passerby later identified as Anurag Sharma who had come to withdraw money from the ATM while returning from a night shift saw the men and alerted his friends about it.
 
 Sharma and his friends managed to pin down the three youths though they were carrying a country-made weapon and inform the police. Seeing the men, they tried to run away in a car but Sharma and his friends chased them in their car and managed to waylay them nearby. The area beat constable too had reached the spot by then.
 
 â€œWe received a call from Sharma about three men trying to break into an ATM and a team led by ACP Raja Banthia was formed to nab the men. Three of them were caught from the spot. Police recovered breaking equipment, a pistol and some cash from the men,
 
 During interrogation, they claimed that Ankit and Vishnu agreed to help Manish arrange money as he was being pressured by his girlfriend to run away from their homes and marry.
 
 Manish told police that he had watched a Youtube video about ways to crack an ATM and planned to rip out the cash box in a similar way.
