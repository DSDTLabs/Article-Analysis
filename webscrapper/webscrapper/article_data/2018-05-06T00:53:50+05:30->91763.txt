NEW DELHI: Even as the embers of the furniture continued to smoulder at Vineet Garg’s Kewal Park residence in Adarsh Nagar, the family members were trying to come to terms with the fact that the two youngest members of the family were gone forever.

 Garg said that he and his wife had gone to a   reception at GT Karnal Road and had left their two children in the care of their grandmother. The kids, he said, had wanted to catch their favourite cartoons on TV.
 
 “Sarthak and Akshara insisted they did not want to accompany their parents to the wedding because they wished to make full use of their school holidays to relax and watch TV. Had they gone with their parents, they might well be alive at the moment,” grieved a relative.
 
 When the parents heard the news of the fire, they left the wedding and hurried home. Garg called his tenants on phone to ask about the situation there and about the status of his children and other family members. He was told that everyone had been rescued.
 
 The firemen, who were told that there were four kids in the family, presumed all four were accounted for. However, while they had counted the two children of Anurag, Garg’s brother, among the rescued, they mistakenly thought that the two visiting kids of the tenants were Sarthak and Akshara.
 
 “It was only later, after the fire had been doused and the firemen reached the first floor, that they found the bodies of my children,” said a distraught Garg, adding that the doctors had tried to revive the 10-year-old boy in vain.
 
 The Garg brothers run a furnishing business in the area. Sarthak was studying in Class VI, while Akshara was in Class IV in a private school in the neighbourhood.
