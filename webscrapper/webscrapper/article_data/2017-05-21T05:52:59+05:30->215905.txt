THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Having suffered the unwanted attentions of a self-anointed godman from Class X onwards, a 23-year-old law student took a kitchen knife to her tormentor’s penis when he once again tried to force himself on her in her home on Friday night.

 After almost dismembering the rapist, the young woman called the cops herself and sought their protection. Her abuser, Gangesananda Theerthapadhar alias  , 54, is under treatment at Medical College Hospital here after undergoing emergency surgery. Hospital sources said 92% of his penis was severed but has been tenuously re-attached to its base. Currently the focus is to restore his urinary tract, they said.
 
 Though not Bobbitisation in the strict sense, the law student’s act bore uncanny resemblance to the climax in ‘22 Female Kottayam’, a 2102 Malayalam movie that made headlines for depicting a young woman who gives a monstrous man his due. Friday night’s incident won the loud approval of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan who called it, “a courageous step, no doubt about it".
 
 State Women's Commission member   expressed shock over the incident and said the young woman was forced to take the extreme step after suffering years of "harassment, pain and humiliation."
