 Kejriwal told the CEO that all AAP candidates had already said that they did not require security being provided to them. Yje candidates have given affidavits to the respective returning officers, saying that they did not require the mandatory security for candidates.
 
 Kejriwal said it was his party’s position that given poor law and order in Punjab, all security apparatus should be deployed for the safety and security of people. He asked the EC to take this decision to restore the confidence of people.
 
 An AAP spokesperson said most ruling party leaders had been given Punjab Police and   security, but these personnel were made to run errands. The EC has recently withdrawn 1,200 police personnel from security duty, but still about 2,000 police personnel are deployed with political leaders.
