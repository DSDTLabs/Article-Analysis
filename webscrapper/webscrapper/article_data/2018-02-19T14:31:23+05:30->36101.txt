 ISRO will be launching a satellite every month this year and Chandrayaan 2 is one among them.

 He also said that a palm size SOS device designed by the ISRO is in its pilot run to help deep sea fishermen who venture into the sea for weeks. “The device would help fishermen to ascertain their location apart from getting vital details on weather conditions. The device has been designed to convey message in vernacular language which would be taken to the fishermen through respective state governments,” he said.
 
 Information is being conveyed to respective state governments on the techniques of saving ground water by preserving the rain water in strategic locations through satellite images and signals. Besides, vital inputs on the identification of right place for taking ground water are also being shared with the help of satellites, he said.
