AHMEDABAD: Two officials of a IndusInd bank branch, a deputy manager and cashier, have allegedly decamped with Rs 24 lakh in Rs 2,000 notes. Cashier   and deputy manager  's cellphones are switched off. A complaint has been lodged with Changodar police station of Ahmedabad district.

 According to the complaint lodged by bank manager   keys of the bank used to be in custody of the deputy manager and the cashier. “Both the keys have to be used to open the bank vault,” said a police official.
 
 Police sources said bank manager Pillai and his colleague   had brought cash of Rs 24 lakh from their Prahladnagar branch on January 2 and deposited it with the cashier.
 
 “The bank could not be opened as Patel did not turn up on January 3, hence they had to bring a spare key from their Prahladnagar branch. On opening the vault they found Rs 24 lakh missing,” said a police official. 
 
 Changodar police station inspector M M Ganguly said they are hunting for the two suspects.
