NEW DELHI: If Union minister   has her way - she usually does, in such matters - 90-year-old US citizen Kantaben, who doesn't want to go back to the land of  , won't have to leave India in her twilight years.

 Kantaben's plight was brought to Swaraj's attention by an 
  in The Times of India. The   native had been living in the US with her younger son, who last November sent her off to Gujarat with an expired Indian visa. She was allowed into India on a 72-hour visa. 
 
 It's now the end of January and Kantaben is still here, because she just doesn't want to go back to   where she has "no one to talk to." But she's a US citizen and not an Indian citizen. Thus, the conundrum.
 
 Lucky for her that external affairs minister Swaraj read about her, because here's what the minister tweeted last night.
 
 
 
  
 On January 12, the Foreign Regional Registration Officer gave Kantaben an ultimatum and asked her to appear before it as soon as possible after she arranged for a plane ticket for the US. She presented her predicament to the home and external affairs ministries, but to no avail.
 
 "I have made representations to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and home minister   for my stay in India. Help me out as I am in no position to go back to the USA and stay with my younger son", she told TOI.
 
 Meanwhile, Kantaben's older son Jayesh told TOI he's clueless about what to do if his mother is forced to go back to the US. 
 
 
 "First of all, we failed to understand how she came to India without visa. With her failing health and her unwillingness to leave India, can authorities guarantee her safe transportation to the US," asked Jayesh.
 
 Kantaben said she was born in India and spent her entire life in Ahmedabad before she went to the US. 
 
 "I have no one to talk to in the US. I am forced to live in the motel run by my son as the house is so deserted," she said.
