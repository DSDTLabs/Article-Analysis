PANAJI: Former inspector general of prisons   said irresponsible approach of the government towards jail and police staff is the cause for prison riots such as the one witnessed at Sada sub-jail Tuesday night.

 “There is a breakdown of government machinery because the government has failed to address issues of the jail and police staff,” Gomes, who is AAP’s CM candidate for the ensuing polls, said, adding that the staff can’t be held responsible for what has happened. “As IG Prisons, I’d asked for repair of the Sada sub-jail several times but no prompt action was taken,” he recalled.
 
 Gomes, who is contesting from Cuncolim, called for a “certain amount of autonomy” for the prison and police departments.
 
 Stating that demands of the escort cell, IRB, and prison department staff have not been met by the home department, Gomes assured “When elected, I will ensure that sufficient powers are given to the constabulary and they would be freed from the clutches of the higher ups who use them even for domestic work”.
 
 The Congress has lashed out at the   government for the violence in Sada sub-jail in which one person was killed saying it is an indication of lawlessness in the state.
