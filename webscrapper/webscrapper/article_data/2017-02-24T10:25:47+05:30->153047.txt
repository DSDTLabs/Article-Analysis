HYDERABAD: Early summers have robbed us of pleasant Februaries. Over the years, the month has turned steadily hotter, thanks to denudation of greenery and increase in the ‘urban sprawl’ or   in the city and its periphery.

 The average temperature in the city has increased by 0.87 degree Celsius in six-and-half decades. It is set to increase by another 0.67 degrees by 2020, 1.02 degrees by 2040 and 1.2 degrees by 2050, according to a study by researchers at the Osmania University’s department of geography.
 
 Last year saw the warmest February in the history of world meteorology. Experts warn that if the temperature continues to rise in the next five days, Feb 2017 may set a new record. Incidentally, the city recorded 38.7°C on Feb 23 last year, one degree more than the 37.7°C recorded on Thursday. However, Thursday was 0.4 degrees hotter than Wednesday. The highest temperature ever recorded in February was 39.1°C on Feb 26, 2009.
 
 An analysis of the weekly data collected by the India Meteorological Department, Hyderabad, shows that the maximum temperature began increasing on Feb 18. The minimum temperature, which was below normal, also started rising from Feb 21. Old-timers recall that summer used to set in only after Mahasivaratri. “But in the last few years, we have been witnessing summer heat from the second week of February itself,” said D Subrahmanyam, a retired employee.
 
 The OU study, which is based on meteorological data for six decades, reveals that the temperature in Hyderabad was “positive” before 1980. “Accelerated warming” started after 2000, when the city opened up to the IT sector. The “extreme warming phase” started after 2010.
