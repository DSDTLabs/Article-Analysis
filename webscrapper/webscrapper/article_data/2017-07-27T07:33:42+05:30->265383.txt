NEW DELHI: External affairs minister   told   on Wednesday that "it's a sin" to presume the 39 Indians, mostly Punjabis, missing in   are dead and that the government will continue its search for them till there is any evidence on whether they are dead or alive. 

 The minister also informed the House that she has asked Iraqi authorities to get back with information only if that is "backed by evidence." 
 
 The 39 Indians missing in Iraq were kidnapped in   three years ago. Swaraj sought the permission of the House to continue the search and also said that if any member wants to tell the families of the missing that they are dead, it should be that person's responsibility if the person returns later. "This government won't end the search for our missing citizens until we have proof they are not alive," the Union minister said in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday , adding that those who say she is "lying" or "hiding the truth" about those missing are wrong.
 
 As the House stalled its protests that began since the morning and agreed to hear the clarifications on the issue after alleging that Swaraj had misled the House, Swaraj said, "I have never misled. I want to ask the opposition what benefit will I get by misleading," she asked. 
 
 The minister cited the case of   war and said the US still considers `missing' its armed forces personnel who haven't been found since the Vietnam war ended back in the 1970s.
