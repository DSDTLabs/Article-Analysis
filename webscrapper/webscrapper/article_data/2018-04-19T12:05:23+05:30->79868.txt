AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Wednesday issued notice to the state government over a PIL challenging the formation of the Gujarat  , claiming that the appointment of its members was in accordance with the Wakf Act.

 After seeking the government’s reply, the bench of Chief Justice R S Reddy and   posted the matter for final disposal on May 9.
 
 The  , a group formed to protect the disposal of properties of Muslim religious trusts, has filed the PIL questioning the notification issued on April 2, by which the state government appointed 10 members to the board. The petitioner also sought HC directions to the state to constitute a new board.
 
 The petitioner claimed that appointments made to the Wakf Board do not satisfy the stipulations of the law. It contended that all 10 members of the board have been appointed by nomination. However, Section 14 of the Wakf Act provides for the elections in certain categories – MP, MLA, Bar Council member and most importantly, the mutavallis (caretakers of shrines and religious places which fall under the authority of the Wakf Board).
 
 The petitioner contended that there are three Muslim MLAs and there is a possibility of holding elections to select one members from the legislative assembly. The Bar Council of Gujarat (BCG) also has multiple Muslim members. The petitioner most strongly asserted the need to appoint a mutavalli representative to the Wakf Board through an election.
 
 The PIL also stated that the government has appointed members without classifying categories.
 
 In 2016, the petitioner had demanded the dissolution of Wakf board, stating that it was continuing to work illegally even after its term had ended. It was on this demand that the HC had ordered the government to form a new board.
