AHMEDABAD: : Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced to bring every trade activity under the tax net, but figures released by the state   department show only a slight increase in taxpayer numbers and a rapid growth in the number of tax defaulters. The figures reveal that 5.53 lakh people registered under the new tax regime in July last year. In the same month, 10,598 defaulters surfaced, accounting for just 1.92% of the total taxpayers. Till February 2018 — a month before the end of the financial year — the number of defaulters swelled to 1.09 lakh even as the number of taxpayers rose to 7.45 lakh; the proportion of defaulters was now 14.73%.

  Besides, apart from businesspersons who did not file returns, 1.04 lakh taxpayers filed ‘nil’ returns in February. If the number of nil returns is analyzed, it becomes evident that the   fell to 13.60% of the total taxpayers in February this year from 26.58% in July last year. The slide may either represent a tactic to avoid being labelled a defaulter or may be the result of a slack business period.
 
 According to officials, a show-cause notice will be issued to those who did not file returns for around six months. “The ‘REG-17’ notice will be given to these defaulters and after thorough scrutiny, their GST registration may be cancelled,” said a  . Recently, the state GST department had initiated a drive to send show-cause notices to those whose returns had major discrepancies. At the same time, notices were also sent in the cases where the discrepancy was less than a rupee.
