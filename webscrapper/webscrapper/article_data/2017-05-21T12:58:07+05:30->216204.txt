  While the cast is busy making the audience roll out laughing with their on-screen comical personas and antics, off-screen also the cast doesn’t shy away from showing off their sense of humour.
  
  Actress  , who is playing the character of  , one of the two wives of   was recently pranked by her veteran actor   who plays her on-screen father Ranjit
  
    is a well-known prankster on set and never ceases to miss a chance to pay gags amongst the crew
  
  So when he learned that   has a slight fear of creeping crawlies like spiders, cockroaches etc., Naveen scared the living daylights out of the actress
  
  Without Hiba’s knowledge, he kept impeccable replicas of insects and small reptiles at Hiba’s dressing room and other parts of the set, scaring Hiba at different junctures of the day
  
  But the biggest trick from Naveen’s playbook was when Hiba found a rubber lizard in Hiba’s lunch box, post which she started crying
  
  Seeing Hiba in such a state, Naveen owed up to all the pranks and cajoled. Both had a huge laugh.
