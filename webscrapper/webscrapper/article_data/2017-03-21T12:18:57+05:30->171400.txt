HYDERABAD: Taking affront with the   for slapping it with a notice for payment of 612 crore as service tax and an equal amount as penalty for   on sale of liquor, the   challenged the move in the  , which on Monday restrained the Centre from taking any coercive steps. 

 The 612 crore notice was for the 2010-12 financial years. The Centre also slapped a notice for payment of 612 crore as penalty for not paying the earlier amount. It gave an ultimatum to the   to pay the entire 1,224 crore in order to avoid further penal action. 
 
 An aggrieved  , an ally of the NDA, approached the high court challenging the decision of the principal commissioner of service tax. It contended that the Centre has no jurisdiction to impose tax on them in this manner.
 
 AP's advocate general Dammalapati Srinivas told the bench of Justice V Ramasubramanian and Justice J Uma Devi that excise income is a state subject and the Centre's service tax wing has no purview to act on it. 
 
 "The privilege fee we collect from licensed liquor shops and bars should not be seen as a consideration for the purpose of levying service tax," the AG said and sought interim relief. 
 
 The bench, while seeking a counter from the Centre and its service tax principal commissioner, directed them not to resort to any coercive steps in the meantime. The case was posted to two weeks for further hearing.
