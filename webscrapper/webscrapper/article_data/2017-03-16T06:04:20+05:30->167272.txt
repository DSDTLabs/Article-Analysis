THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: When former director-general of police   was in charge of prisons, he ordered a change in menu.

 Besides giving an image makeover, it also started raking in moolah.
 
 Of the several revolutionary reforms he had initiated, one was the decision allowing prisoners to wear normal dress when their children, aged below 12, came visiting.
 
 Delivering the 9th G   lecture on ‘Human Rights of Prisoners’ here on Wednesday, Jacob detailed his initiatives. 
 
 “The jail could restrict only two human rights: the right to travel and right to engage in a profession,” he said.
 
 “Earlier, breakfast was wheat balls, which were difficult to eat. I decided to change it to chappati. However, the policemen had to work the entire night in unhygienic conditions to make chappatis. So we purchased chappati-making machines. Then came another issue. Except for two hours, the machines remained idle. So we started selling chappatis to the public,” he said.
 
 The chappatis sold well, helping inmates to send Rs 3,000 every month to their families.
 
 The jail authorities also initiated a programme to provide financial aid of Rs 500 to students below Class X and Rs 1000 for those pursuing higher education.
 
 Jacob had intervened to ensure fresh air inside the jail. “The prison walls were 20-feet high and the use of firewood increased the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide levels. A proposal to introduce solar plant for cooking was accepted by Union government,” he said.
 
 The   was organised by the friends of journalist G Rajesh Kumar, who died on March 15, 2008.
