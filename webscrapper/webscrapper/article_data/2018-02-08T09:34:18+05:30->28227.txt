YAVATMAL: The   city police on Wednesday booked 16 bogus farmers who availed   from the local branch of   by submitting fabricated documents. Superintendent of police (SP) M   said cops acted on a complaint lodged by mandal adhikari (circle officer) of land revenue department   on the instructions of the Yavatmal sub-divisional officer (SDO) Swapnil Tangade.

 All the 16 accused are resident of Saikheda. They availed a crop loan of Rs 22 lakh by producing a fabricated 7/12 extract in their names in 2017. The alleged mastermind, police patil of Saikheda Sudhakar Kawale, got the search report prepared from a lawyer. Kawale also took a loan of Rs 2 lakh. 
 
 One of the real land owners Gulabrao Ulhe exposed the scam by filing a complaint at the SDO office in January. SDO Tangade immediately conducted an inquiry and forwarded a copy of the report to the bank manager   and instructed him to take necessary legal action against the accused. 
 
 When the bank officials allegedly ignored the instructions, the SDO ordered his subordinate officer to file police complaint.
 
 Sources in police said most of the accused don’t own any agriculture land. The branch manager said that he has referred the matter to his higher ups. “We have filed FIRs against nine persons while reports will be filed against others, including the lawyer who submitted bogus search report to the bank, on Thursday after going through the documents,” the bank manager said.
