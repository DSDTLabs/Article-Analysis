ALLAHABAD: At a time when there are speculations are rife about a probable alliance between   (SP) and Congress, enthusiastic Congress workers have come out with yet another poster. 

 This is not the first time that a poster has been put up in the Sangam city. From advocating for the entry of   in active politics to portraying Rahul as Arjun and Amit Shah as Ravana, enthusiastic party workers have become vocal in expressing their happiness about a coalition between ruling SP and Congress, ahead of UP assembly elections. 
 
 While one poster, released by Haseeb Ahmad, bears photos of the top ranks of the two parties, the other, put up by Irshad Ullah, talks about Rahul and Akhilesh. The poster put up by a group of people claims that the alliance would cross the 300 mark in the upcoming assembly elections. 
 
 Haseeb poster reads: Lakdi se bana chandan..maha gathbhandan. Although, Haseeb claims himself as Congress leader, office-bearers of the party maintain that Haseeb is not the member of the party. UPCC spokesperson, Kishore Varshney said, “Yeh illiterate log hain jo muft ki popularity ke bhuke hain, party ka inse koi wasta nahi hai (these are illiterate people, who indulge in such acts for cheap publicity, and the party shuns such acts). 
 
 These   are also circulated on WhatsApp groups to get maximum popularity. 
 
 Talking to TOI, deputy district election officer,  , said, “I have informed all the returning officers about such posters being displayed in the city and circulated on WhatsApp groups. Action will be taken against them under a suitable clause of model code of conduct.” 
 
 However, Irshad Ullah said, “We are not violating the model code of conduct. It’s just to express our happiness over the alliance, which is sure to become a reality in a couple of days.”
