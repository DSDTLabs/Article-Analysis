NEW DELHI: Midway through the tenure of the Modi government and ahead of presidential polls, BJP consolidated the   ranks with all 32 members of the grouping resolving to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls under the leadership of Prime Minister  .

 A resolution, adopted with prominent allies including Akali Dal member Parkash Singh Badal,   chief   and TDP chief   expressing full faith in Modi’s leadership and announcing the intent to contest the next Lok Sabha battle under his stewardship, was seen as a statement of political intent.
 
 Coming in the wake of BJP’s big win in Uttar Pradesh, the NDA dinner and resolution were an exercise to project a winning force and underline the alliance’s political dominance with electoral battles in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh lined up at the end of the year.
 
 Sources wondered whether the solidarity exercise was meant to close ranks ahead of presidential polls. Although BJP has the numbers to ensure its nominee’s win after incumbent Pranab Mukherjee’s term ends, the task will be facilitated if it keeps the flock together. 
 
 However, finance minister Arun Jaitley denied that a discussion on the presidential polls was on the agenda. As the alliance parties are drawn from across the country, the move could be seen towards consensus about the presidential candidate.
 
 The meeting also marks a thaw in BJP’s ties with its troublesome Maharashtra partner Shiv Sena as Uddhav Thackeray, who usually prefers not to visit Delhi, was present.
 
 It can give BJP a psychological advantage because the opposition is in a disarray and Congress’s debacle has dented the viability of its claim to lead the opposition.
 
 “All leaders including Uddhav Thackeray were praiseworthy of the decisive and bold leadership of Prime Minister Modi and resolved to contest the 2019 LS polls under his leadership,” Jaitley told reporters.
