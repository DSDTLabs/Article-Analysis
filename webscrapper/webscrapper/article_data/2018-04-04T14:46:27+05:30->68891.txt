A   filmmaker was arrested on Monday by   for allegedly circulating an unedited bath scene of an actress on social media. According to reports, the 28-year old actress informed the police that she had been requesting the 29-year old accused Bhojpuri filmmaker,   to delete the links but he refused to remove the link from the porn site. 

 In an FIR registered by the actress, she has alleged that the accused also placed a demand for make-up charges of Rs 15,000 for a short film made in 2017. The video was first uploaded on   where it gained thousands of views. The video also contains unedited clips of bath scenes from the film. 
 
 As per the report, the victim stated in her complaint that the film was shot in three days at Verma's office in Andheri, Mumbai last year. Speaking of the particular scene, she said that while a bath scene was being shot, her towel came undone, which Verma shot. Apparently, he cleared her payment and, while leaving his office, she requested him to delete that particular scene, which he assured he would. A few days later, she learnt from friends and relatives about the unedited bath scene being uploaded on YouTube. It was later picked up by three porn sites. 
 
 Verma has been arrested and is said to be in police custody till April 5, 2018.
