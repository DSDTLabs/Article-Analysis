BENGALURU: Teachers and staff who discriminate between students do not deserve to be in the profession, the high court has said. The scathing comments came while the court disposed of a petition filed by  , which runs Vivekananda School in NTI Layout, challenging orders passed by the   for Protection of Child Rights.

 
 “Children studying in educationalinstitutionsfrom nursery to Class 10 are sensitive and even a small act of discrimination, like preventing one student from going to the sports complex while allowing others, can damage the psychology and welfare of the student,” Justice Vineet Kothari noted.
 
 “If such discrimination is caused by teachers and/or staff of the educational institutions,they do notdeserveto be in this profession.”
 
 Acting on complaints from 24 students, Swami Vivekananda School Students’ Parents’ Welfare Association had approached the commission in December 2016 stating that the
 
 school was charging a fee higher than that fixed by the   (DERA). They claimed DERA had fixed the fee at Rs 43,394 per student, but the school was charging Rs 20,000 more per student claiming it was for providing additional facilities, including sports.
 
 Based on the complaint from the parents’ forum, the commission, on January 29, 2017, directed the school to furnish certain information, including CCTV footage and photographs of annual sports day events .
 
 The commission found that the school had indeed discriminated against students and directed the deputy director of public instruction to take action. It requested the ICSE board to withdraw its affiliation and ordered the school to donate five computers each to government schools as a token punishment.
 
 The school, however, approached the court, contending that since they had to meet standards fixed by the ICSE board, including providing sports facilities, they had the right to charge extra fees.
