MUMBAI: A 24-year-old cricketer was on Monday arrested for allegedly driving his car onto a platform of the Andheri railway station, causing chaos during the morning rush hour, police said.

 Harmeet Singh, who represented India in the ICC Under-19 World Cup in 2012, drove the four-wheeler directly onto the platform 1 of the busy station at around 7.20 AM, they said.
 
 The   immediately confiscated the car and arrested Singh, a senior RPF official said.
 
 He has been booked under sections 147 (trespass), 145 (b) (commits nuisance and act of indecency), 154 (endangering safety of passengers) and other relevant provisions of the Railway Act, the official said.
 
 Singh made his debut in first class cricket for Mumbai in Ranji Trophy. Presently, he is representing Jammu and Kashmir in the Ranji Trophy.
 
 His name had also cropped up in the list of players, who were allegedly approached for spot-fixing, given to police by a bookie.
 
 The bookie, however, had said that because of Singh's young age the idea to approach him was dropped.
 
 The cricketer was later given a clean chit by the BCCI.
