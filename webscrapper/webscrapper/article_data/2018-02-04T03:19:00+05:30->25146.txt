Vijayawada: The   party is waging a war against the inordinate delay in the completion of Kanaka Durga   in Vijayawada. Launching a scathing attack on chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) president N Raghuveera Reddy said that the name of the flyover should be changed to ‘Chandranna’ flyover instead of Kanaka Durga flyover.

 Reddy pointed at previous incidents and the present delay in completion of the flyover works.
 
  He said it was during Naidu’s first stint as chief minister the crown of goddess Kanaka Durga was stolen. In the present term also, mischievous things have happened in the temple in the form of unauthorised rituals. “It seems like our chief minister does not care for goddess Kanaka Durga and that is the reason why he is not concerned about the completion of the flyover named after the goddess,” he said.
 
 The APCC chief reminded that Naidu protested against the then Congress government. 
 
 “He criticised us saying we were incapable of completing the flyover. He even dared to say that he would complete the construction within one year if we handover the work to him. Today we are asking him what happened to the 12-month deadline and when it would be completed,” Reddy said.
 
 He alleged that TDP leaders were responsible for the delay. He said works were stalled multiple times by the ruling party leaders for reasons well known to the public. It was a shame that the irrigation minister himself changed his house to camp office at Gollapudi because of travelling delays but left the people of the city to their fate, he added.
 
 The Congress party initially planned to hold a dharna at the work site but later shifted the protest venue to Dharna Chowk as the police denied them permission. Reddy warned the government to complete the work by this March-end or else his party would launch a massive protest. He said, he would sit on an indefinite hunger strike if the works did not get completed by the end of March.
