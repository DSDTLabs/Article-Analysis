They have been in the business of filmmaking for just over three years, and have already made three film, Ninnindale, Masterpiece and the upcoming  . Each time,   — led by   and his brother  , who serves as executive producer on all productions — has strived to deliver classy, big-budget family entertainers. “We want people to identify our production house with its work in bringing good Kannada films to audiences. Our focus has always been on having good directors work on great scripts and not compromising on the requirements of filmmaking, be it the cast, locations or any other visual grandeur. That does not mean that we will only make big films. If there is a good script that works best with newcomers, we will do it, but we will do justice to the making and not look at it as something that can be done with minimal means just because it has newbies,” says Vijay. 
Right now, with Raajakumara ready for release on March 24, the team is hoping that their second collaboration with   will work well. For Ninnindale, the team had got the Power Star to do adrenaline-pumping adventure sports, including sky-diving. Have they done even more outrageous stuff for this film? “Oh no. This time we just surrounded him with a lot of people. In the 20 days that we shot in Mysuru and the few days in Goa, he was on set with at least 25 other artistes,” he explains.
 The confidence that the makers have in their film is high, so much so that they are distributing the film themselves in 250-300 centres in Karnataka, with a simultaneous release across the country. “We’ve identified centres in Tamil Nadu, Goa, Mumbai, Pune, Vijayawada, Kolkata and Noida among others, which have a sizeable chunk of Kannadiga population. If all works out well, audiences in Singapore and Melbourne will see the film on March 24 and the rest of the world a week later,” says Karthik.
