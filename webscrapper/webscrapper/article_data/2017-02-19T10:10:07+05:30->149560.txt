BENGALURU: A black patch of charred weed covering nearly 300sqm of the  , a grim reminder of its brush with fire on Thursday, greeted visitors on Saturday. Construction debris, plastic waste of varying hues and form, and other trash were strewn across the surface of the lake, one of the largest waterbodies in Bengaluru. 

 Around fifty residents of Bellandur gathered near the lake on Saturday to voice their concerns over the plight of the waterbody. Seeking immediate implementation of the recommendations of the Lake Expert Committee, Bellandur residents said repeated incidents of fire are the result of indiscriminate dumping of garbage and debris, in addition to the flow of untreated sewage.
 
  S Singh, a member of the  , sought to know why the recommendations of the expert committee, which had held the flow of untreated sewage into the lake as a major problem, were ignored by the authorities. "The committee has suggested short-term and long-term remedies. The report was submitted to the BDA six months ago. Are the authorities waiting for a catastrophe before taking action?" asked Singh. 
 
 The demand for immediate measures to be taken to restore the lake to its former glory also comes in the wake of a government panel submitting a report on the state of Bellandur Lake in the Karnataka high court on Friday. Stating that the lake was highly polluted, the panel has recommended measures to rejuvenate the waterbody. 
 
  "At least eight trucks - private and   vehicles - dump garbage into the lake. Bellandur doesn't have a single dry waste collection centre. The BBMP built two skeletal structures for dry waste collection a few years ago, but they have not been used till date. All the dry waste is dumped here, and ignited," said   of  , a volunteer body that looks into waste segregation.
