On   last year, Devika Gupta, a third-year student of Miranda House, was walking to the Vishwavidyalaya Metro Station from her college at 2.30pm, when two boys on a bike suddenly stopped near her. They threw two water balloons at her, shouted, "Bura na maano, Holi hai!" and sped away.

 As the festival of colours approaches, the frequency of such incidents in and around Delhi’s college campuses also increases. To control such harassment, the  , as well as college authorities, are taking several steps, including increased patrolling in campuses on Holi.
 
 Police officials, both male and female and in uniform as well as plain clothes, will be deployed around colleges, especially near girls’ hostels. There will be control rooms in DU’s North Campus and South Campus to deal with any incident. The control rooms will be jointly operated by officials from DU, Delhi Police and DTC. DU authorities have also approached the DTC and Delhi Metro to make sure that Holi-related harassment cases don’t happen. DTC drivers have been asked to take their buses to the nearest police station if there are any acts of hooliganism. Entry to colleges, hostels and other areas in campus will be regulated through I-cards only.
 
 Madhur Verma,   and PRO of Delhi Police, says, "People should not throw water balloons on passers-by and on those who don’t want to play Holi with them. We can’t arrest people for throwing water balloons, but if someone files a complaint about any misbehaviour, we will take action. Security has been increased all over Delhi to ensure that people don’t misbehave on the streets."
