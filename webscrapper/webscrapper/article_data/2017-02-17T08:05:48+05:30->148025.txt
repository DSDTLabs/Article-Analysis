NEW DELHI: Two days after two   were murdered at   in  , the police claimed to have apprehended a juvenile. He stayed in the same colony as the victims and had called them to the park to resolve some issues, said the police. A family member of the   is also likely to be questioned. 

 Though the police are yet to make any official statement, sources said the juvenile had told counsellors that he attacked Ashu and Ankush with a cleaver he had borrowed from a meat shop. He claimed that the cousins used to abuse him in public since he had accused one of them of misbehaving with his sister-in-law.
 
 Sources said the teenager had changed his statement several times. He first tried to implicate his brother but later denied it. The police suspect that the woman’s sandal found next to the bodies belongs to someone from the juvenile’s family. Family members of the victims said that while Ashu had got the call, Ankush had accompanied him suspecting a showdown. 
 
 The 17-year-old has been sent to a juvenile justice home. Sources in the colony say the juvenile was earlier involved in an attempt-to-murder case and was detained. 
 
 The probe reveals that a woman had asked them to meet her at the park. Sources said the juvenile had first accused Ashu of having an illicit relationship with his sister-in-law and asked them to confront her. This led to an argument among the three during which the juvenile attacked them. They were stabbed more than a dozen times. However, the police are also suspecting that another person might have helped the juvenile. 
 
 The police have found a motorcycle belonging to a relative of the juvenile which, they suspect, was used as the getaway vehicle. The bike was found abandoned outside the park and the police later traced its owner to Moti Nagar.
 
 The call details of the two victims and the juvenile are being scanned to verify the claims.
