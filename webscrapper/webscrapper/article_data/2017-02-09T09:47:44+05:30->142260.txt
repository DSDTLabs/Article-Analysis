PUNE: The Non-Resident Indians’ Parents’ Organisation ( ),  , is in the process of forming a   of Non Resident Indians’ Parents’ Organisation (CONRIPO), bringing under its fold similar units from various parts of the country.

  of NRIPO told TOI that there were several individual such units operating in the country. “Our organization being one of the foremost in addressing the problems of NRI parents, we decided to create a confederation that will involve organisations from different parts of the country. We have already prepared a plan for setting up the confederation,” Swadi added.
 
 Parents of NRIs as well as NRIs themselves face several problems, which need to be voiced at a national forum that is directly in touch with the government, hence the need for CONRIPO, he said. “Instead of individual units taking their concerns to the government, a confederation, which will represent all such units across the country, is needed,” said Swadi.
 
 Parents of NRIs need help in various matters like medical support, counselling in travel plans, visa and passport rules and regulations, health insurance, air ticketing, asset management, security and safety arrangements during their absence from home, foreign exchange facilities for travel, gifts to children, inward-outward remittances, besides emotional and moral support in their loneliness.
