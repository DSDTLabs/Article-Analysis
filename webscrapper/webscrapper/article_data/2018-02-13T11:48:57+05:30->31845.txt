PANAJI: Chief minister   on Monday ruled out forming a   corporation to run mining operations in the state. Last week, the Supreme Court quashed the renewal of 88 mining leases and asked mining leaseholders to stop operations by March 15. 

 NGO Goa Foundation, which took the government to court over illegal mining in the state, had challenged the lease renewal. The NGO had said that the government should run mining in Goa through a corporation.
 
 Parrikar, who also holds the mining portfolio, told reporters that forming a mining corporation isn’t a viable option for the government as it would invite multiple problems. 
 
 The chief minister said earlier the government was in favour of auctioning the mining leases. “But only due to the high court order, we moved for renewal of leases.” 
 
 Referring to the Congress demand that   be restricted to Goan mine owners, Parrikar said that if auction is decided then it has to be open to all.
 
 He said the state government is seeking legal opinion before taking any decision on leasing out mines in the state.
 
 Parrikar said the government is studying various aspects of the Supreme Court order. “We will see that mining resumes as early as possible. The state government will not have any major revenue impact, but mining dependents could face the heat of the order,” he said.
