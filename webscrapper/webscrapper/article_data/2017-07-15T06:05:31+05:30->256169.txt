Following seats remaining vacant after the final round of counselling last year, JoSAA decided to conduct seven rounds of counselling. But for the fifth round of counselling there is this solitary vacancy in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering branch this year. However, new vacancy could come up in fifth round as candidates often withdraw to join different institutes or even forfeit their seats during counselling . JoSAA conducts counselling and admission in engineering courses at 93 participating institutes (IITs, NITs and 20 GFTIs).
