Tirupur: A micro irrigation expert from an Israel-based company visited drip-irrigated paddy fields at Govindapuram near Dharapuram here on Wednesday.

 Dr eliVred, head of research and development, Netafim, also interacted with the farmers and observed how effectively drip irrigation was employed in the country for the first time to grow paddy.
 
 “Though drip irrigation was widely used to cultivate various crops from vegetables to trees, it was seldom tried to grow paddy. But four farmers from the drought-prone Govindapuram successfully utilised this method in their paddy fields,” said B J Pandian, director, Water Technology Centre, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.
 
 With 5-6mm average rainfall annually, Govindapuram was one of the drought-affected areas in the district. Since it was located at the tail end of Amaravathi river irrigation scheme, it hardly receives surface irrigation facility, Pandian said.
 
 “Hence, the four utilised the available water to the maximum effect with the help of drip irrigation. They cultivate three crops a year. They take up onion cultivation in April-May, paddy in November-February and maize in between the two crops,” he added.
 
 They had been effectively utilising the drip irrigation for rice for the past two year. And with this, they could conserve 30% of water. The drip irrigation consumes only 750mm-800mm water (for 110 days) against the average surface water consumption of 1,250mm. Even the yield could be enhanced from five tonnes per hectare to six tonnes.
 
 “While many farmers are struggling to cultivate two crops effectively in water-rich regions, the farmers in Govindapuram have succeeded in cultivating three crops with drip irrigation,” Pandian said lauding them.
