Madurai: Villagers of Keezhadi on Tuesday told judges of the Madurai bench of the Madras high court that if the superintending archaeologist of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) P S Sriraman, is allowed to continue, they would not give their land for further excavation.

 Pouring out their complaints to the judges who had gone to inspect the Keezhadi site, they said that Sriraman has not been showing proper interest in carrying out the ongoing excavation work. They charged that he intentionally forbids many facts about excavation and does not respond properly to people coming to see the site.
 
 One villager Chandran told the judges that the government had not given compensation to villagers who gave their land for excavation work. The division bench of justices M M Sundresh and N Sathishkumar heard a batch of cases relating to Keezhadi excavation. When they came to inspect the site on Tuesday, Sriraman explained to them about the articles found at the site.
 
 To queries from the judges, the officer replied that the artefacts found could be kept in the nearby community hall or district museum, if the court ordered. The pits dug earlier during two rounds of excavations were covered, which will be opened based on necessity. When the judges were about to leave the site, villagers thronged them and started airing their grievances.
 
 At present, the ASI is undertaking third phase of excavation, in which so far 1,800 artefacts have been found. This excavation will come to an end on September 30. A proposal has been sent to the government to carry out fourth phase of excavation.
