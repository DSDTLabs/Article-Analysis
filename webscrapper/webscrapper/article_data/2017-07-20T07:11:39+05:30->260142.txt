AHMEDABAD: Police registered an FIR against three people for assaulting a 22-year-old   youth and stabbing him in the stomach, after the latter kicked a cow blocking his way. 

 Vishal Arsodiya, 22, was riding a scooter when a herd of cows came in front of him and blocked his way. "On Sunday, a day after I kicked the cow, I was heckled by three men. One person verbally abused me, the other thrashed me with wooden stick while the third stabbed me with a knife," Vishal stated in the FIR.
 
 "There are cows blocking the roads all the time. I am now scared that I will be targeted again," he added.
 
 Vishal, a resident of Radharaman Ni Chali in   area, is currently recovering from his stab wounds at his home. Doctors treating him said that he is stable, but will take some time to recover completely.
 
 Vishal's mother Jassiben said that she is scared for her only son. "The cow owners and authorities should ensure cows do not loiter in public places. They could have scolded my son but who gave them the right to inflict a life threatening attack on him," said Jassiben.
 
 "We have identified three accused, a father and his two sons. One of the accused is Raju Rabari. We will arrest them soon," said ACP (I division) S S Raghuvanshi, adding that the case will be transferred to SC-ST cell soon.
