HYDERABAD: The move to reopen civilian roads in   may have taken a step forward and three steps backwards, but the issue is beginning to thaw with all the stakeholders planning a joint inspection of the 14 roads which are still in a 'no-go' zone despite MoD's order to the Local Military Authority (LMA) to keep them open for commuters. 

 
 Top officials of LMA, elected representatives of eight SCB civilian wards, Secunderabad Cantonment MLA, Malkajgiri MP and other public representatives will undertake the joint inspection soon to settle the differences. A resolution was passed in this regard at an all-important SCB meeting, which was chaired by president of   MD Upadhyay here on Thursday. 
 
 Seizing the initiative, the residential welfare associations (RWAs) raised the LMA bogey of not implementing the MoD's orders to keep open all the 25 public roads and sought SCB vice-president J Ramakrishna's immediate intervention. Ramakrishna responded, "Though specific orders were issued by the MoD, we know they are yet to be implemented." He hastened to add that he made a representation to  , impressing upon the three major demands of residents: reopen all the closed roads, remove all barricades/walls and allow morning walkers. 
 
 Malkajgiri MP Ch Malla Reddy said there is still no clarity on which roads had opened. He went ballistic on the LMA, saying "lakhs of road users are in a big dilemma whether the LMA is implementing the MoD orders or not." Buoyed by his strong posturing, representatives of RWAs insisted that a "concrete decision" be taken in the meeting, but gave in after the board passed a resolution on joint inspection of the roads.
