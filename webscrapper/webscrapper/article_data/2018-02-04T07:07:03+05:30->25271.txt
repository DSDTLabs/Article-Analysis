HYDERABAD: Hayatnagar police solved the murder of 23-year-old engineering graduate N   by arresting her fiance on Saturday. 

 The culprit, A  , 25, is a manager of a private finance company from Shamshabad. Mothilal, a distant relative of Anusha, was in love with her since 2013. They were betrothed nine months ago and became physically intimate due to which Anusha became pregnant. Anusha had finished engineering and a few months ago came to Hyderabad to prepare for police constable entrance exam. 
 
 While she was at her sister's house at  , a neighbour saw her lying dead in a pool of blood in the house on January 30. Hayatnagar police reached the spot and confirmed that the assailant killed Anusha by throwing a boulder on her head.
 
 The needle of suspicion pointed at Mothilal from the beginning as he was missing after the murder. Police arrested the accused near TKR Kaman in Hayatnagar on Saturday and, on interrogation, he confessed to have killed Anusha. "After Anusha and Mothilal were betrothed, he used to frequently check her cell phone. Mothilal suspected that Anusha was having an affair with another man whom she met at the coaching centre and decided to kill her," deputy commissioner of police, LB Nagar, M   said.
 
 On January 28 night, Mothilal met Anusha, who was alone at her sister's house. They had an argument about her pregnancy and Mothilal manhandled Anusha. After she went to sleep, Mothilal threw a boulder on Anusha's head and killed her. Police produced the culprit before the court and he was sent to judicial remand.
