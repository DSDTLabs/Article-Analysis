Kolkata: In a bid to rein in erratic autos, that have been a major traffic menace on city roads for several years, the   has drawn up a plan that will roll out soon.

 The primary goal is to bar three-wheelers from parking on important roads and not letting them pick up passengers randomly, instead of designated stoppages. Passengers will have to get on and off at designated stretches, similar to boarding buses at stands. However, unlike bus stands, these points will not be restricted a few feet but stretch between 50-150 metres.
 
 According to cops, the first trial will be carried out on Prince   Road. They said, that unlike what has been reported so far, they are not specifying bus stops as auto stops. Rather, a few spots — much higher in number than bus stops currently on this road — have been designated as  . Autos that stop in the middle of the road or narrow thoroughfares, such as, the stretch between Lords More and Dhaka Kalibari or the Lake flyover will be penalized.
 
 The arrangement has been made keeping in mind local concerns and the auto union has been kept in the loop. “Sergeants have warned us against illegal parking. But there shouldn’t be restrictions on dropping passengers at their specified locations,” said Mohd Shehzad, a driver on the   route. Auto driver Sajal Das agreed the move can be implemented if traffic guards guided them. “This will require all parties to be patient. We’re not yet clear on what cops mean when they say parking will now be restricted,” said Das.
 
 TOI drove through the stretch on Tuesday and found that autos were avoiding sudden stops. However, neither passengers nor auto drivers knew where the designated stoppage points were. “The locals should be involved if the cops want to succeed,” said Sidip Poddar, a Golf Green resident.
