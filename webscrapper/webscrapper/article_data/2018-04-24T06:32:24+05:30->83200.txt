BENGALURU: Three persons claiming to be   of a private insurance firm have cheated 68-year-old Muralidhar S, a retired private firm employee and resident of Konanakunte, south Bengaluru, of Rs 50 lakh. They assured him insurance benefits, including life coverage pension and tax exemption.

 Subramanyapura police registered a case of cheating against Ganesh Kumar, Chandrashekar R and Rajesh, based on a complaint by Muralidhar.
 
 Muralidhar told police he received a phone call on March 1 this year from Ganesh Kumar, fund manager of a private insurance firm. Ganesh offered to invest Muralidhar’s money in the firm and become his business partner. Kumar said Muralidhar would get various benefits, including medical insurance, life coverage pension and tax benefits. Ganesh sent his two associates, Rajesh and Chandrashekar, to Muralidhar’s house where they explained the scheme, took his cheque for Rs 50 lakh and fled.
 
 The conmen encashed the cheque and sent a fake insurance bond to Muralidhar. He suspected something amiss while going through it and rushed to the insurance company mentioned during the discussion. The firm confirmed it was a fake bond and there was no such scheme. Muralidhar tried to contact the conmen but they did not take his calls.
 
 Muralidhar filed a complaint with Subramanyapura police. “We registered a case of cheating. The victim has provided a few of their mobile numbers and we’re trying to trace them,” an officer said.
