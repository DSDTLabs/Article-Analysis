NAGPUR: All seats in schools under the free   ( ) Act quota have been oversubscribed within four days of the   opening. As of 6pm on Sunday, the   had received 7,466 applications against 7,102 seats available in both pre-primary and primary section.

 Premchand Raut, a member of the department supervising the process, said, “Almost a 1,000 applications were received n Sunday. The process so far has been smooth and we have enough help centres to help parents, who may have trouble with the online process.”
 
 The online application process will continue till February 25 and if the current rate of applications continues, then seats are likely to be subscribed three to four times. The entire process of RTE admission has now been taken online and works uniformly across the state. In the earlier years of RTE admission, when it was offline, every district would chart out its own timelines and work to meet those deadlines.
 
 When the online portal was introduced, only some select cities took it up, including Nagpur, but the separate date system was in place. In Nagpur district, schools in rural areas completed the RTE admission process in offline mode while those in city used the online portal. Now, the state has implemented a coordinated system where every school in the state follows the same timetable.
 
 Raut said the online application process has brought in tremendous transparency to the system, which is watched by everyone. Raut said, “We are also seeing the benefit of transparent online application process reach those really in need. We have had instances of physically disabled candidates getting proper guidance to fill up the online form. The guidance centres spread across the city have been a boon, because not every parent is comfortable using the internet and here they get help free of cost in filling up the form.”
