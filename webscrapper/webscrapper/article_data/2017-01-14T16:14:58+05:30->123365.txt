Actress   finds it really difficult to date a celebrity. The 19-year-old star, who recently split from  , feels dating in the entertainment world is the 'worst thing'.

  
  
 "Dating in   is literally the worst thing. People are really crazy on social and, unfortunately, I date people that have girls, like, in love with them." "They're, like, really in love with them and they want to kill me. Literally, I was getting death threats, full-on death threats on Twitter," Thorne said. 
 
 Thorne says people might think that actors do not get bothered about what public write about them over   but that is not true as it hurts the actress a lot. People think it doesn't hurt but let me tell you, it does hurt. It doesn't feel good to read this about yourself online even when you know it's not true. 
 
 "That's always the worst part, when it's not true. If it's true, you're kind of just like, 'OK, you're calling me out. This is true'," Thorne said.
