SURAT: Two minor girls, abducted from Prakasha of   in Maharashtra, were rescued from a dargah at   village of Kim in Surat district by the police with the help of local people on Sunday. 

 
 
 Police arrested a 61-year-old man, who had abducted the girls with the intention to sell them, but had failed to find any buyers. The accused was handed over to cops from   police station of Nandurbar.
 
 The 11-year-old girl and her eight-year-old sister were handed over to their father, a priest of a temple at Prakasha. Imran Sha, a resident of Kothwa village near Kim, alerted other villagers and the police on noticing the girls outside the dargah.
 
 Accused Baban Bhima   was nabbed from outside the dargah and handed over to the Shahada police. He had abducted the girls from Prakasha on May 21. Their father had lodged a complaint at Shahada police station the same day. Pawra is a distant relative of their father and was once given shelter by him. He abducted the girls when he found them alone and brought them to Kothwa dargah. 
 
 Sha noticed the girls crying outside the dargah and asked what was troubling them. They informed him that they had been forcibly brought there by a man. Sha confronted Pawra, but he failed to provide a satisfactory explanation to him why he had brought the girls there. Sha soon called other villagers and also alerted the cops.
 
 “We have handed over the accused and the girls to Shahada police as they are investigating the case,” in-charge police sub-inspector, Kosaba police station, Z L Odedara said.
 
 “We suspect that the girls were abducted by the accused with the intention to sell them. However, he failed to find buyers. There are also unconfirmed reports of the accused planning to offer a sacrifice. However, if he wanted to sacrifice the girls, he could have done it soon after bringing them here,” police inspector, Shahda police station, S S Shukla said.
