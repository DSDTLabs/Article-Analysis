BHUBANESWAR: The BJP on Sunday faced an embarrassing moment when nine of its newly-elected   (ZP) members voted against party's nominee for ZP chairperson post in   resulting in his defeat.

 The defeat was preceded by an ugly spat between two factions of the party. In a clash involving the ZP members, party's state vice-president Sameer Mohanty was injured as some BJP workers beat him up and hurled shoes at him.
 
 The saffron party - upbeat over its impressive performance in the panchayat poll by winning 297 zilla parishad seats up from just 36 in 2012, with BJD's seats falling to 473 from 651 - faced a rude shock when its official candidate got defeated in Sambalpur. 
 
 This despite the fact that BJP had got a clear majority in Sambalpur by winning 13 out of 18 ZP members posts. 
 
 The BJP fielded Pramod Sahu as its nominee for ZP chief post. Though his win was considered a foregone conclusion given the party's majority, nine of the 13 members opposed him.
 
 Tension prevailed after Sameer Mohanty announced Pramod Sahu's name as party leadership's choice for the ZP top job. The faction opposed to him started hurling abuses at Mohanty, beat him up and threw slippers at him. They then fielded Radheshyam Barik as their choice.
 
 Barik filed papers as an independent and eight of his colleagues voted for him. Four Biju Janata Dal (BJD) members did not take part in the voting.
 
 After the dramatic development, the BJP suspended the nine ZP members besides former minister Jayanarayan Mishra and former Sambalpur district BJP president Nauri Nayak. Mishra and Nayak were blamed as brain behind the anti-party move.
 
 Stating that he had no role in the attack or the ZP’s decision, Mishra said, “Whatever happened is unfortunate. I condemn it.” BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said the party had to a take a tough decision as the members went against the party decision.
