PATIALA: Thousands of peasants from   on Thursday held a protest near Parliament, seeking loan waiver. They marched from Gurdwara Bangla Sahib towards   raising slogans but were stopped by the Delhi Police, who had raised barricades on Parliament Street. 

 Addressing the farmers at the rally, BKU ( ) president   said the farming community in Punjab owed a debt of over Rs 80,000 crore and was forcing many to commit suicides. He claimed that during the last 30 years, nearly two lakh families from Punjab had been forced give up agriculture. He alleged that the farmers had been forced into debt because of the anti-peasant policies of the Union government.
 
 Another farmer union leader Buta Singh Burjgill accused Centre of neglecting farm loan waiver. "While Prime Minister   has been announcing debt waiver for UP farmers, there has been no (such) word for Punjabi farmers. We are prepared to struggle, for do or die game on this issue," he said.
