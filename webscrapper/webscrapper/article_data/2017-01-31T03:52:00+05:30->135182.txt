NEW DELHI: A 21-year-old   who was stabbed a dozen times by her stalker and his nephew about a fortnight ago died on Monday morning. 

 Having failed to kill her earlier with poisonous fumigants used in agriculture, the obsessed man, Amit, knifed her in her house in outer   on January 18. The woman, Anu, had rejected his marriage proposal a number of times. 
 
 The entire episode was witnessed by Anu’s three-year-old niece. Family members said Anu couldn’t speak after the incident and used to keep weeping silently. 
 
 “She had regained consciousness for some time before falling asleep two days back. She had tried moving her hands as if trying to convey a message. I will never come to terms with the fact that she will never open her eyes again,” said Anu’s elder sister. 
 
 Amit and his nephew were arrested a day after the incident. Amit, the son of a Delhi Police assistant sub-inspector, was enamoured of the 21-year-old even though he had married another woman four months ago. Unable to handle rejection, he had conspired with Basant, his 19-year-old cousin, to murder her. 
 
 “There were days when she used to keep crying but did not tell us about the stalker. The man was known to us and stayed in our house many times but we never knew what he was conspiring,” said the woman’s younger sister. 
 
 Family members alleged that Amit had also tried to poison Anu on January 6, her birthday, but failed. 
 
 “After she cut the cake, I saw her crying in a corner,” said Anu’s elder sister. “When I forced her to tell me what had happened, she said Amit had forced her to have some tablets and said that he could not see her getting married to anyone else”.
 
 Doctors told the police that Anu was in the ICU since the last two weeks and was showing no signs of recovery. The woman was a teacher at the same playschool where her niece used to study.
