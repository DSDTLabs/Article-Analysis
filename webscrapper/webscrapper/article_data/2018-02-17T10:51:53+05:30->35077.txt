Transport services along the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border were disrupted following the Supreme Court’s verdict on the Cauvery issue on Friday.

 Commuters, especially those working in IT and BPO companies, were badly affected due to the nonavailability of buses between the two states.
 
 Officials from the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) and regional transport office in   did not allow vehicles bearing TN registration to ply beyond the Tamil Nadu border. Vehicles with   registration were not allowed to enter Tamil Nadu.
 
 TNSTC bus and private bus staff asked the passengers to disembark at Hosur in Krishnagiri district. From there, the passengers were forced to walk for at least 10km to take Karnataka government buses from Attebelle. “Van and auto drivers who were plying between Jujuwadi and   charged exorbitant fare,” said K Anandha Murugan, a system analyst. He said van drivers usually charge ₹10 to drop passengers at Attebelle from Jujuwadi. “But they demanded ₹100 per head,” he said.
 
 Truck drivers from TN were advised not to operate their vehicles inside Bengaluru or Mysuru. Omni buses plying via Hosur and Bengaluru also stopped their services fearing riots.
 
 While vehicles from Tamil Nadu started entering Karnataka from 7.30pm onwards, vehicles from the neighbouring state were not allowed inside Tamil Nadu.
