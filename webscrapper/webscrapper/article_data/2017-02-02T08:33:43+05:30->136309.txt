BATALA: With Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal trading harsh words over NRIs groups backing them, the political scene has heated up. One such group reached here on Wednesday to canvass in favour of AAP state convener and candidate from the constituency   (Ghuggi). 

 “We are here for providing ground assistance to AAP and want Kejriwal to replicate their Delhi governance model in Punjab,” said an NRI, Dinesh Handa, while talking to TOI. Stating that AAP leaders might be greenhorns in state politics, he added that people still had high hopes from them.
 
 “We, in France, have been closely monitoring all political activities in Punjab and had been analyzing AAP’s model of governance in Delhi. And we are of the view that people in Punjab need to get rid of traditional politicians and political parties,” said Swaran Singh from Paris. He said they were worried to find how parents in Punjab were keen on sending their children abroad, fearing that they might not become drug addicts. He also suggested holding intellectual-level debates among candidates.
 
 Earlier, a plane-load of NRIs had arrived in Amritsar to launch “Flame of Hope” campaign in favour of AAP. A separate group of NRIs was already camping in Majitha assembly constituency, campaigning for Congress nominee Sukhjinder Raj Singh Lalli Majithia.
 
 Meanwhile, addressing a public rally at Lakhora village, Ghuggi said that if voted to power, their party would implement the recommendations of Swaminathan Commission by December 2020 to help farmers get higher price for their produce. Speaking in this industrial town, he also talked about the present state of industry, which, he said, was in a shambles and assured to revive it if AAP was voted to power.
