LUCKNOW: A day after a group of meat exporters and sellers met the CM, their   continued on Friday, the seventh consecutive day. After the CM’s assurance that nobody would be targeted on the basis of caste, creed or religion, the association had appealed to the traders to end their strike. 

 But without a valid licence, they couldn’t. Most of them don’t have a licence and the ones that had been issued expired on March 31. The municipal corporations, on the other hand, were yet to start the process of issuing fresh licences.
 
 Some food joints, including  , started serving mutton and chicken delicacies from Friday. Raheem’s nahari kulche and Mubeen’s pasanda shops remained closed. 
 
 Owner of Raheem’s at Akbari Gate said, chief minister Yogi promised meat traders’ association members that they would be issued licences.   said once the supply of meat resumes, he will begin serving the city’s favourite biryani again. 
 
 Owner of a meat shop in Old City, Ainul Qureshi said he and other shop owners had applied for renewal of licences and will reopen when they get them.
 
 As soon as UP government announced its decision to take action against unlicensed slaughter houses on March 21, Lucknow Municipal Corporation swung into action and sealed nine   in Mahanagar and Aliganj. This hit meat supply in the city badly. 
 
 On March 23, all buffalo meat shops in the city were shut down forcibly by police. The most adverse effect of the closure of meat shops was seen at prominent eateries like Tunday Kababi, Raheems and Mubeens.
