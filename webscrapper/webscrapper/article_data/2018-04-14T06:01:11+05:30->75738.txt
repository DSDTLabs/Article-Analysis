PANAJI: As part of the   department’s efforts to provide online services to citizens, the department will now allow vehicle owners whose vehicles are registered in Goa to apply online for schemes that have been notified by the department. 

 
 
  
 The online service, which has already been launched, will cater to government schemes for private bus and taxi operators, and one scheme for road-accident compensation available to private vehicle owners.
 
 “If the citizen or registered transport vehicle owners intends to apply online for any of the schemes, they may register at www.goaonline.gov.in to avail the benefits. The system is being introduced with immediate effect,” a department official said.
 
 Beneficiaries will no longer need to visit the department and they have to provide the Aadhaar number along with other proof of identity. An SMS and email will be sent to notify successful online applications as well as for various status updates for services. If any additional information is required, the applicant will be informed through the online portal.
 
 “The application will be visible online for the department officers to verify and approve within the stipulated duration. Once the approval is given, the applicant will be able to download the sanction order copy, which also carries an e-signature,” an official from the department said.
 
 “Citizens and registered transport vehicle owners need not stand in line or visit the departments to submit the application forms or follow up with department officials. This will reduce paperwork and also the interaction between citizens and officials,” a department officer said.
