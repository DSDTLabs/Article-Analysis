Recently, there were rumours of how   and her family have been hunting for a dream holiday home in Goa. Now, we hear that the actress, who is currently shooting for 'Saaho' and 'Stree', with Prabhas and   respectively, has dropped her plans of investing in a property in the beach state. Shraddha and her family had nearly finalised a scenic bungalow near Vagator Beach, but due to some unforeseen circumstances, the Kapoors have put that plan in cold storage for the time being.

 A friend of the actress told BT, “Shraddha and her family had almost finalised the property. It was a beautiful, spacious house near the beach, which all of them had liked. Unfortunately, they discovered that some of the paperwork seemed faulty. Eventually, the person they were dealing with told them that it wasn’t his house. It belonged to his girlfriend and she wasn’t keen on selling it off. The paperwork had to be immediately stopped. The family had spent a lot of time scouting properties, so this experience has been somewhat bitter.” We reached out to Shraddha’s father   for a comment, but he didn’t respond.
