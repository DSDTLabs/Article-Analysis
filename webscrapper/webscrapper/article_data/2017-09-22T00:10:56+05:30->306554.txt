MUMBAI: Western Railway has ordered a high-level inquiry after a train speeded past   tracks at Nalla Sopara  . A video of the incident went viral since it happened on Wednesday morning. Even though there was no mishap, the incident has been taken seriously following a series of accidents over the past few weeks on Indian Railways.

 The video shows Jaipur-Pune Superfast Express speeding by and water splashing on platform 4, with passengers scurrying for cover at 6.45am on September 20. The scene was similar to one in an amusement park when water splashes as the roller-coaster moves ahead.
 
 WR chief public relations officer Ravinder Bhakar said, “General manager Anil Kumar Gupta constituted a 3-member team, which will submit a report in three days to fix responsibility for the lapses.”
 
 Sources said the   of Virar-Dahanu has been taken off duty and he will be questioned by operating department inspectors to ascertain his level of knowledge for the role he has been posted for. Prima facie, the station manager has been held responsible as he failed to provide a memo to the train’s loco pilot about speed restrictions in place of 8kmph on the water-logged stretch at   station.
 
 A senior official said the train passed through the stretch at 60-70kmph. The pilot applied brakes to bring it down to 30 kmph.”
 
 The speed at which the train passed was dangerous and there could have been a derailment if there had been damage to the tracks which could not have been spotted by the loco pilot as the tracks were under water.
 
 Another official said, “The water level was 150mm above the top of the rail. It is not possible to spot submerged tracks from a distance at such high speed for the motorman.”
 
 Railway activist Subhash Gupta said, “Other departments are responsible too. The engineering department neither placed the speed restriction board nor did it depute a man with a flag to caution the loco pilot.”
