Gurgaon: At a time when the Haryana government is busy promoting the mobile application, ‘Harpath’ as a one stop solution for road repair complaints, residents across Gurgaon have been sharing their disappointing experiences with the app which often closes the complaints after displaying messages like ‘there are no potholes’ or ‘you could not be contacted’.

 Residents for Sector 109 said that they have raised more than 50 complaints on the app, but haven’t ever received a positive response. “I’ve raised more than 30 complaints on the app regarding the two approach roads to the sector, but every time the complaint is closed with response that the problem does not exist or the road does not have any potholes,” said Sushil Kumar, a resident from the sector. Vibha Batra from Sector 30 spoke to both MCG and Huda after submitting two complaints, but no step was taken. Some of the people said that they were even not able to register their complaints on the app. Harpath was launched in September, 2017. According to a government report, till December, 2017, around 7,000 people had downloaded the app, of which 215 people belonged to Gurgaon. The report also stated that following the complaints on the app, 78 spots on the roads of the city have been repaired too.
