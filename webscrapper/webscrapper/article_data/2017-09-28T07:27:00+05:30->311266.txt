Patiala: Five Indians including four Punjabi boys have been absolved of the death penalty in Sharjah, UAE. The five persons including Dharmendra, son of Vijay Kumar, a resident of Chapra district in Bihar, Ravinder Singh, son of Hardial Singh of Ajnala in Amritsar, Ranjit Ram, son of Gurlal of Zinsra village in Nawa Shehar, Dalwinder Singh, son of Banarsi Dass of Malpur village in Hoshiarpur district and Sucha Singh, son of Karam Singh of Jasso Magra village of Patiala had been convicted by the Sharjah court for having killed Varinder Chauhan, a resident of Shekapuria village in Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh, on November 4 in 2011.

 NGO Sarbat Da Bhalla has been consistently making efforts to free the boys. Speaking to the TOI from Sharjah, chairman of the Sarbat da Bhalla trust S P S Oberoi said that the parents of the accused approached him. He later got in touch with the victim’s family and managed to pursue them to accept the “blood money” and pardon the accused.
 
 The victim’s family agreed to accept Rs 20 lakh as blood money and gave a pardon letter. The pardon letter was produced before the Sharjah court on Wednesday, which approved the documents. Oberoi said the accused are now likely to be released next month, as they have already spent six years in jail.
 
 Oberoi claimed that till date he has managed to save lives of 88 persons by paying the blood money. These include 11 Pakistani nationals, 64 Punjabis, five people from Bangladesh, three from Hyderabad, one each from Haryana, Gujarat, Bihar, Maharashtra and Philippines.
 
 As per the court documents, Varinder had been murdered during a fight over bootlegging. All the accused had been arrested the very next day of the crime and were later found guilty of murder and put on death row. They have been in the Sharjah jail since then. On a plea moved by them, the court had allowed them time to come to a compromise with the victim’s family before their execution.
