NAVI MUMBAI:   will start garbage lifting on its own from October 1, coinciding with its second foundation day. Citing the election code of conduct that is prevented PCMC to float tenders for garbage collection, Panvel civic chief   sought three months’ time to take over garbage lifting work from Cidco. The latter has agreed to the deadline at a meeting held between PCMC and   officials on Friday. 

 The second election code of conduct has delayed the tendering process of PCMC by at least two months.   said, “ The election code of conduct will end on July 7, 2018. Thereafter 45 days will be required for the tendering process followed by 15 more days to finalise the contract and mobilisation of resources."
 
 Cidco chief engineer   said, “This was a preliminary discussion. PCMC do not have complete infrastructure and various modalities were discussed. The maintenance works to be done by Cidco as identified during joint inspection with PCMC will be completed before the hand over. Deshmukh said that the issue of dues will be resolved after discussion with Cidco management. TNN
