GHAZIABAD: Residents may have complained about wastage of public funds on miles of bicycle tracks constructed across   over the past three years, but with the   regime announcing plans to demolish them, opinion is divided on the fate of the previous   (SP) government’s pet project.

 State urban development minister Suresh Khanna announced last Sunday that the bicycle tracks would be demolished since they were unused and caused traffic congestion. The announcement made by Khanna, which was a reiteration of what the minister had told TOI in April, sparked sharp criticism from former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.
 
 TOI spoke to residents in Ghaziabad about the necessity and utility of cycle tracks in the city. A section of residents, who pointed to the civic mess, called for demolition of the tracks while another section argued in favour of the tracks.
 
 “The tracks were never used by cyclists. Encroachers, including hawkers and street vendors, have squatted on the tracks in most areas,” said Vireshwar Tyagi, a doctor based in Raj Nagar.
 
 Many other residents said the cycle tracks should be retained because they have provided safe space for pedestrians and joggers in the absence of pavements and footpaths.
 
 “A large number of people use the cycle tracks for jogging and morning walks in the absence of pavements and adequate number of parks. The tracks have not entirely lost the purpose for which they were built. It is the job of the local authorities to ensure they remain free from encroachments,” said Manish Tyagi, who runs a medical coaching institute in Indirapuram.
 
 The   had planned for 100km of tracks at a total cost of Rs 34 crore. But the project is now in limbo. “We have not received any orders so far pertaining to demolition of the cycle tracks. As of now, we have not planned any further expansion of the project,” GDA secretary Ravindra Godbole told TOI.
