LUDHIANA: Announcement of election schedule for   elections by State election commissioner Jagpal Singh Sandhu on Tuesday has made the ticket seekers of political parties jittery as nomination process for the polls will be started from February 8th and with just one day to go,   and Congress are yet to announce their candidates for the polls. However Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has already taken lead by announcing candidates for 38 wards three days back and have kept only 10 tickets pending which are likely to be announced by the party tomorrow. Campaigning by the 38 candidates whose names have been announced by SAD is going on in full swing and they are confident that they will certainly have an edge over their rivals due the delay in finalization of the tickets by Congress.

 Speaking to TOI, Ranjit Singh Dhillon, district president of SAD, said “We have announced 38 candidates already while our rival congress is still thinking which candidates to choose. They are delaying announcing the candidates as fear has gripped the congress leaders that their candidates do not stand a chance against the SAD nominees”   also said, “There is no doubt that this delay will prove costly for Congress and will give us an advantage over them as our candidates have already covered significant part of their campaign in their wards.”
 
 According to  , SAD candidate from ward number 44 said, “There is a lot of difference between SAD and our rivals, unlike the Congress which has still not announced even a single candidate meanwhile SAD has allotted tickets purely on basis of merits to deserving candidates. Our tickets were announced on February 3rd which has given us sufficient time to campaign and go in public and project the developmental works done by our party during its rule and expose misdeeds of congress party.”
