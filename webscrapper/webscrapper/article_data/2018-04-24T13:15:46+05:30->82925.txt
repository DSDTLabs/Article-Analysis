CHENNAI: The   ( ) has directed the state government to pay a compensation of Rs 1 lakh to a sweet stall vendor who was harassed and implicated in a false criminal case in 2007 by the then sub inspector of Vishnu Kanchi police station.

 The SHRC bench headed by retired IAS officer, Chittaranjan Mohandoss, directed the government to recover the amount from the policeman, V Mariappan, who is now retired from service. In his petition, V Manoharan, who ran the sweet stall, said he had entered into a lease deed with the plot owner in 1999. After paying him an advance of Rs 15,000, Manoharan had constructed a building and paid rent to the owner, Balasubramanian.
 
 Eight years later, the owner made attempts to sell his property and insisted that Manoharan vacate the place. According to the petition, on December 7, 2007, Ekambaram, his wife Pushparani, and a few henchmen descended outside his stall and ordered him to vacate the building. A day later, Mariappan, along with Ekambaram, threatened Manoharan. The sweet stall owner was assaulted, after which the sub inspector booked him for a case of harassment against a woman after which he was remanded to custody. The petitioner alleged that his family was threatened and assaulted while he was serving time in prison.
 
 “They demolished the kitchen and locked the house. The SI threatened to file another false case if we open the shop again,” the petition stated.
 
 In his reply, Mariappan denied the allegations and said it was a false complaint. After perusing the available materials on record, Chittaranjan said the SI had unnecessarily interfered in a civil matter only with the sole intention of evicting the complainant from the property illegally.
