NEW DELHI: Talks of a vertical split in   over its draft political resolution drew a sharp, formal repudiation from former general secretary   in the latest edition of the party mouthpiece People’s Democracy. 

 Karat, also the editor of the weekly paper, said in a signed piece that the while the adoption of the draft political resolution by the majority vote in the central committee meeting of the party has raised much comment in the media and political circles, the differences of opinion are nothing more than a reflection of CPM’s “true inner party democracy”. Karat said, “Even before the Central Committee meeting, when it became known that there is a   draft resolution and a minority draft resolution to be presented before the Central Committee, a lot of reports appeared in the mainstream media. 
 
 Most of them were either ill-informed about the style of functioning of the CPI(M) as a  , or, they utilised the occasion to draw motivated and distorted conclusions intended to depict the Party leadership in a poor light.” Dismissing all claims that the differences were a result of factionalism within the party, Karat said, “A common theme found in the media, particularly in Kerala and  , was to portray that two drafts have been presented by two “factions”. 
 
 Some went further to depict it as a clash between two individuals, in this case, the current general secretary and the former general secretary. Such a depiction is baseless and wrong as discussions on differing political views and approaches within the framework of inner-party democracy are reduced to personality clashes and so-called personal differences.”
