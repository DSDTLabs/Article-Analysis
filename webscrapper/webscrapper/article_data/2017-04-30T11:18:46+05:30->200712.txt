CHARMINAR: The Quli   Stadium, the only sports arena of its kind in  , will be out of bounds for sports enthusiasts and youngsters for the next nine months. 

 The stadium has been drawing scores of youngsters from the Old City and other neighbourhoods which are close to the stadium. Notices were installed on entrances to the stadium which informed visitors, especially  , that they will not be allowed to enter for specified hours as the arena will be in use for 'training' purposes. 
 
 "Ground is temporarily allotted to   for (9) nine months with effect from 28.04.2017. During training period no civilian or sportsmen will be allowed inside the ground," an excerpt from the notice reads. Restrictions on entry have been placed from 5 am to 9 am and from 3 pm to 7 pm. The move comes as a blow to the youth of the Old City, as the area is already dealing with an acute crisis of open spaces.
