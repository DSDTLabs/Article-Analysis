BHOPAL: With appointment of five governors by President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday,   has been again left waiting for a full-time governor despite repeated demands by the opposition parties. As the President cleared names of governors for Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Andaman and Nicobar  ,   and Bihar, it was expected that Madhya Pradesh would also get a full-time governor. At present, Gujarat governor Om Prakash Kohli is holding the additional charge of Madhya Pradesh. He was given the additional responsibility after Ram Naresh Yadav's tenure ended on September 7 last year. Since then Madhya Pradesh is waiting for a permanent governor and all the files and matters related to him are sent to Ahmedabad by flight.

 In June, leader of opposition Ajay Singh had urged the then President Pranab Mukherjee to appoint a full-time governor in Madhya Pradesh. "Since there is no permanent governor in the state, it has become difficult for the delegation of Congress MLAs to meet him. Being the constitutional head of the state, the governor should be available for the people so that constitutional decisions are taken within a specific time-frame,‚Äù Singh had stated in a letter written to the then President.
