ALLAHABAD: Waving to a cheering crowd, fear is not what you see in the man’s eyes sitting as he drives a car at 40kmph, while circling a wooden frame positioned around 50 feet above the ground. The possibilities are endless, the car could turn turtle or worse still it could crash. The fear of death notwithstanding, for Azhar, who is driving the car it is a matter of his livelihood. 

 The Magh Mela is visited by hundreds of Hindu devotees from all across the country. It also springs up opportunities for earning money for many people like Azhar and his brother Savai, cutting across religious lines.
 
 The brothers leave the crowd on an edge with their daredevil act, ‘Maut ka kauna (The  )’, while managing to earn up to Rs 1,500 every day. As per Azahar, the amount is “Enough to support my family”.
 
 Hailing from Meerut, the brothers travel across the country and perform the stunt at various fairs and festivals. “We were not very well-off and I knew that I had to do something for a livelihood. I saw someone performing this stunt and decided to do the same. A man from Muzaffarnagar trained me and I practised the stunt for over a year before performing it live,” said Azhar. 
 
 “Apart from courage, the show is all about perfect speed which has to be controlled by balancing,” said Savair. “We take special care to maintain the engine of our vehicles and the quality of the tyre,” he added.
