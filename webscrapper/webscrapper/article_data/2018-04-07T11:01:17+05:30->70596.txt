PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has suggested that Mormugao Port Trust ( ) and   chalk out a solution to the imbroglio over unloading a vessel of coking coal at the port.

 Vedanta approached the high court after MPT informed it on April 2 that it was withdrawing its permission sated February 12, 2018, to dock its vessel alongside berth No 9. Based on the February 12 communication, Vedanta had ordered a ship to bring in coking coal from Australia. Vedanta, moved the court to allow the ship to berth, failing which they would have to pay high demurrage charges. When the matter came up on Friday, the court felt the two parties must find a solution between themselves. 
 
 Earlier this year, the state pollution control board refused MPT permission to use   for coal transfer from incoming ships. Subsequently, the port authorities decided to allow Vedanta to berth at berth no 9.
