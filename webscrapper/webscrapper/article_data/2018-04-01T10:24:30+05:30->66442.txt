CHENNAI: Passengers who wait outside the   (RGGGH) bus stop for buses coming from Broadway and North Chennai face a tough time with several buses skipping the stop and, instead, halting nearly 350m away near the signal opposite Central station. Often, passengers end up running behind moving buses to get aboard risking their lives.

 Only buses that go straight towards   halt at the designated stop outside RGGGH and those going towards Park Town flyover to go to Mount Road, skip the stop altogether. “Even when the bus shelter is located outside RGGGH, none of the buses stop there. My wife missed buses twice while waiting at the stop. She had to run the third time to catch a bus,” said CR Balaji, a resident of Mandaveli.
 
 Several commuters said that people are so accustomed to boarding buses from the signal that it has turned out to be an undesignated bus stop, though without a shelter or seats. After several bitter experiences of running after and yet missing buses, G Rajeswari has decided to not wait at the bus shelter outside the RGGGH.
 
 
 “The situation is worse during rains and summer, but due to lack of an option we end up waiting here, near the subway,” she said. With multiple buses halting at the signal, a traffic chaos persists round the clock on the road opposite the Central station. Despite the presence of traffic police, congestion at the signal goes unregulated. Several senior-citizen commuters are at the mercy of oncoming vehicular traffic as they struggle to board buses at the signal.
 
 “Drivers have to halt at the stop outside RGGGH and also at the signal. they prefer the signal. Besides, there are oral instructions on ensuring passengers from   are taken aboard thus, they make stoppages outside stairs from Park Town station on to the flyover connecting Mount Road,” said K Anbazhagan, a former  . Despite numerous attempts to reach them, senior MTC officials were unavailable for comment.
