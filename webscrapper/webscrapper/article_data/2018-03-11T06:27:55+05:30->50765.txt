PATNA: A trader was shot dead at   while a couple was found murdered at Shrirampur Tola under the   area on Saturday.

 Four bike-borne criminals shot Ram Bacchan Rai (45) in his head and abdomen near his shop of building materials at   Hat under the Digha police station area when he was walking on the road in the evening. The criminals moved his lifeless body to ensure that he was died before they fled from the spot.
 
 City SP (central) D Amarkesh said it seemed he was murdered due to old enmity. He said the assailants were Rai’s neighbours with whom he had a scuffle on some issue and they had threatened him with dire consequences. “Raids are on to nab the assailants,” the SP said.
 
 In another incident, the bodies of Sunil Kumar Gupta (40) and his wife Anita Gupta (34) were found inside their residence at Shrirampur Tola on Saturday morning. City SP (west) Ravindra Kumar said the couple had a shop of cosmetics and gift items at Maner. “Bricks and wooden sticks were used to smash their heads. Their neighbours had heard some noise around midnight but they did not make out something fishy as loud music was being played in the neighbourhood,” Kumar said.
 
 He said a worker spotted their bodies lying in a pool of blood as the main door of their house was open. He said two bricks and a wooden stick used in the killing were recovered from the spot. “The killers were known to the couple as there was no sign of forced entry,” he said.
