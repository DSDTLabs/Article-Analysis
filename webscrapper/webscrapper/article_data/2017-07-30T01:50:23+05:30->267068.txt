Such incidents should not be tolerated and it is imperative for us to protest against them and force the college authorities into taking quicker action,” said  , one of the students in the protest. 
 
 The sit-in was held with permission from the principal, and had been publicised through social media and classroom campaigns.
 
 “The relationship between a student and a professor extends to questioning and challenging, but violent means are always condemnable,” said Anil Kumar head of the department of  , while addressing the gathering. “What pains me is that the authorities could have taken suo motu action against the accused, but failed to do so. It has been 15 days now. We need to force the disciplinary committee to take action sooner, so that this incident acts as a deterrent. Such behaviour is disruptive of the SRCC culture, and should not be perceived as part of it,” he added.
