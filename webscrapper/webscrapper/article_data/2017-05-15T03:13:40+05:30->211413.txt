NAGPUR:  , a concert laced with poetry, philosophy and melody, broke the mould of run of the mill musical events that rely on Bollywood hits. 

 Upcoming   and   brought alive some popular ghazals, a niche genre more or less confined to those who understand Urdu poetry, at Scientific Society Hall on Sunday.
 
 It was nostalgia for those who have spent their youth aching over poetry of Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Bashir Badr, Nida Fazli. For the relatively young in the audience, it was the underlying thought, pain and desire which made the presentation appealing. 
 
 The mood moved from excited to sombre as Joshi began his renditions with ‘Baat niklegi toh door talak jayegi’ and the evergreen ‘Ranjish hi sahi’ and gradually moved to ‘Kagaz ki kashti’ and ‘Main nashey main hoon’. 
 
 A trained classical singer, Prasan has adopted ghazals as his genre and does full justice to the immortal hits of Mehdi Hasan, Ghulam Ali and Jagjit Singh.
 
 It is his understanding of the ragas which help capture the finer nuances of ‘Yaman Kalyan’ in ‘Ranjish hi sahi’, of raga ‘Jinjhoti’ in ‘Abke hum bichade’ and raga ‘Bageshri’ in ‘Tere baarey main jab socha nahi tha’.
 
 Matching Prasan’s vocal skills was Sonali Dixit who impressed with her crisp and crystal clear voice as she began with the famous Madanmohan composition ‘Rasme ulfat ko nibhaye kaise’. Her robust voice suited the compositions as she did full justice to ghazals like solona sa sajan and elevated the duet ‘Duniya jisey kehtey hain’ to another level.
 
 The stage also belonged to the musicians who helped in generating the mood and the sentiment, especially with the mellifluous strains of guitar and violin. The programme was presented by Shri Siddhivinayak Publicity.
