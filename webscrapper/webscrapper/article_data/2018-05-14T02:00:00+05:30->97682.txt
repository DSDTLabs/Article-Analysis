PATNA: Padma awardee Sudha  , who works for the uplift of dalit community, on Sunday said she would organise a protest march in Jehanabad on May 15 to press for a fresh probe into the disrobing of a minor dalit girl by 13 youths, a video of which had surfaced on April 29.

 “The fresh probe should be done under the supervision of a woman IG-rank police officer,” Varghese said in a statement. 
 
 Immediately after the video surfaced, a special investigation team was formed by Patna IG Nayyar Hasnain Khan which nabbed four accused within 24 hours. Between May 1 and May 4, the other nine were also arrested. 
 
 The incident took place on the outskirts of Bharathua village under the Kako police station area in Jehanabad district on April 25. Of the 13 accused, eight are minors.
 
 “We met the victim and her family on May 6. We asked her about the incident. She was in captivity of the youths for at least four hours. It appears she was gang-raped,” Varghese said.
 
 She said the survivor’s family complained to her that the four women police constables, deployed for the protection of the family, were sleeping on bed while the family members were forced to sleep on the floor.
 
 Varghese said she met DGP K S Dwivedi the next day, who assured necessary action. “In front of us, he directed Jehanabad SP Maneesh over the phone to remove the women constables from inside the victim’s house,” she said.
 
 However, IG Khan refuted Varghese’s claim of gang rape. He said the girl was examined by a medical board which did not confirm rape. “Also, the girl recorded her statement before a magistrate, and denied rape,” Khan said.
 
 The SP said a strong chargesheet in the case would be submitted very soon.
