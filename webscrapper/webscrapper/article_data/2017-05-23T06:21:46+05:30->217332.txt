SHILLONG:   chief   on Monday slammed the ruling   government in Meghalaya for its 'failure' to protect women and to address crimes against women and children.

 "On women security, the (Congress) government has failed totally. Statistics show that in the period between April and May, 100 sexual assaults were reported in one month. The worst is that minor girls are raped and tortured," Rahatkar said while addressing a meeting here.
 
 She alleged that 42 minors were raped in the state in the period between January and February.
 
 "If someone is sleeping, they can be woken up. But if the government is pretending to be asleep, you cannot wake it up," Rahatkar said and alleged that the police were not allowed to work freely.
 
 Stating that   would not tolerate such injustice, she said that the party would form the next government in 2018 in Meghalaya.
 
 On  's waste management index which plunged from 53 last year to 276 this year, the BJP leader said that she was sad because Meghalaya was known for its natural beauty.
