NAGPUR:   officials have strongly advised students and parents to disregard rumours floating on the   about dates of board exam results. In the last week many people have received forwarded messages, mostly on WhatsApp, about HSC (Std XII) and SSC (Std X) exam dates. Queries to schools increased drastically from parents who mistook such messages to be genuine. Madhusudhan Mude, general secretary of Headmasters Association (Nagpur district) said, “Lot of teachers are getting calls from parents about these dates. Apparently some of the   messages look very authentic and claim to be sent directly from board officials. We are advising everyone to wait for official communication from board through traditional media sources and from us.”

 Sanjay Ganorkar, divisional board chairman (Nagpur) said, “No dates for board exam results have been declared yet. The board always announces dates through an official letter that’s issued to schools and media for public dissemination. I strongly urge everyone not to fall prey to rumours and wait the news to come in from official channels.” 
 
 The reason for spike in result date viral messages could be because the results season for all boards is starting. Going by the last few years of results declaration dates, Maharashtra declares HSC results between May 20 to May 31, while for SSC it is from June 4 to 16. This year results are expected to be delayed because board exams started a week late due to civic polls being held across Maharashtra. Board officials announce results date just a day before.
