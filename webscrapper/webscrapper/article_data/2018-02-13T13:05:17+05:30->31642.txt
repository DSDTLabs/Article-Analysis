Coimbatore: Three days after a four-year-old boy was mauled to death by a leopard, a 55-year-old man was killed by a bear at a tea estate near Valparai on Monday. The man had ventured into the woods close to a tea estate when he was attacked by the bear. 

 The twin deaths have spread panic across the estates. Estate workers and local residents now rush home by sunset and remain indoors after dark.
 
 Ranger officer at Valparai forest range P Sakthivel said that the latest victim,   from the Waterfalls Estate near Valparai, had gone to   shola forest located in   reserve forest for collecting firewood on Sunday. After he failed to return to the tea estate staff quarters, his family members alerted the forest department field staff.
 
 A team led by Sakthivel launched a search in the reserve forest and recovered Soosai’s body. His head was mauled by a wild boar. The body was sent to the   for postmortem.
 
 The victims’ family members told police that the man, a bachelor, had come to the Waterfalls Estate to visit his mother’s tomb located near the reserve forest. He was staying in the staff quarters of his younger brother Irudhayaraj.
 
 Sakthivel told TOI that the tea estate workers had seen wild bears often in the forest area near the estate and also in  . “But, animal attacks were not reported from the area in the last five years. We requested the people not to go to the reserve forest as a lot of wild animal are moving around,” he said.
 
 Several leopards were sighted in the Valparai area recently. A few days ago, a leopard had killed a four-year-old boy. 
 
 “There is no reason for people to be afraid. We have taken adequate steps to prevent wild animal attack in Valparai and surrounding areas. We have deputed three special teams, who are doing patrol round-the-clock. People can contact the forest department staff at any time,” Sakthivel added.
