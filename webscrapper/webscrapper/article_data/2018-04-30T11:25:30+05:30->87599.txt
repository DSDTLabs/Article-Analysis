CHANDIGARH: The members of various resident welfare associations (RWAs) opposed the suspension of Surinder Sharma, president of RWA, Sector 15 and questioned Federation of Sectors Welfare Associations of Chandigarh (Foswac) on how they can suspend a member without consulting the executive members of the association. The members also raised questions on why the issue was not taken up at the annual general body meet, which was held on Sunday. “We want to know under which rule the   took the decision to suspend the member. Why the association did not consult the members?” asked the members of RWAs.

 Recently, the core committee of the association asked J S Gogia, general secretary, Foswac to issue suspension notice to Sharma. The association claimed that Sharma was not the president of the sector and for the past two years after the elections were conducted in the area, someone else was working at his place.
 
 Hitesh Puri, vice-chairman, Foswac, said the chairman does not have power to intervene in the functioning of the RWA as per the constitution of the association.
 
 As per norms, the annual general body has to decide if any member will be suspended or not and the decision should be taken by the majority of the members of the association. He also raised an objection as to why the association did not seek clarification before suspending Sharma.
 
 Major D P Singh, president sector development and RWA, Sector 38, said Foswac has no right to get involved in the functioning of the RWA. Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman, Foswac, said that he will constitute a four-member committee, which will look into the matter. The committee will conduct an inquiry and submit a report.
 
 Surinder Sharma, president RWA, Sector 15, said he will appear before the committee with all the documents to prove that he fought the elections and was elected as the president of the sector.
