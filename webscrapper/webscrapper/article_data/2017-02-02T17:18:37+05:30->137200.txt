PUNE: Backing his senior player   to the hilt, India's outgoing   captain   said that the tennis star should be the only one to take a call on his future as a player.

 "He should continue to play as long as he wants to play. No one should tell anyone else (On when to retire) and as long as he is fit enough to play, it should be his call on retirement from Davis Cup or tennis altogether. (Roger) Federer said the same thing. (But in) Davis Cup the selection committee decides on the team," said Amritaj ahead of India's Asia-Oceania Group I Cup tie against New Zealand commencing on Friday.
 
 There have been reports that the All India Tennis Association would like to inject fresh blood into the team at the cost of Paes who is 43-years-old and plays only doubles.
 
 A top office bearer of the AITA echoed similar sentiments and said it will all depend on Paes's rankings and who else is available to play.
 
 "It all depends on his ranking and who all are available. It's wrong to write him off," the official said when asked whether the Cup tie could be the last for Paes.
 
 Meanwhile Amritraj, who will give way to   after the tie against New Zealand, said it the AITA that should answer why he was shown the door while coach   continues.
 
 "About the selection of captain and coach you have to check with AITA. They decided to keep one and change one. It's their call," he said.
