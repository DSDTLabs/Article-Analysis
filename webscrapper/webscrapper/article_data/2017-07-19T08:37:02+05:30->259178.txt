SURAT: Hitesh Sanklecha, a textile trader who was fighting for the removal of   on MMF fabrics, broke his 18-day-old   here on Tuesday. 

 Sanklecha, who was on a hunger strike on behalf of the 65,000 textile traders in the 165 markets here, broke his fast in the presence of his supporters at a public meeting near Good Luck market. 
 
 Amid the huge presence of textile traders and workers at the public meeting, Sanklecha said since the traders have bow down before the government due to the weak leadership of the Textile GST Sangarsh Samiti (TGSS), he has no option but to end his hunger strike. 
 
 “I have asked the TGSS to call the meeting of presidents and vice-presidents of all the 165 textile markets in the city to take their unanimous view on continuing the strike. At the STM meeting, there were representatives of a few markets and the FOSTTA declared that majority of people wanted the markets to reopen,” Sanklecha said. 
 
 At the public meeting, the traders continued to shout slogans against Central government and Union finance minister Arun Jaitley. A recorded song opposing GST and targeting Arun Jaitley was continuously played on the stage. 
 
 After the public meeting was over, hundreds of people hit the roads from Mahavir market and forced a few markets on their way to shut down. It was after the intervention of the police, the crowds dispersed and a few protesters detained from the spot.
