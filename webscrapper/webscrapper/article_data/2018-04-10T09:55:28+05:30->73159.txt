HYDERABAD: Stating that an order passed by an authority does not become effective until it is communicated to its intended recipient, Justice B   of the Hyderabad High Court on Monday reserved his judgment in the petition filed by two   MLAs who were expelled from the Assembly on March 13, 2018.

 The petitioners, Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and S A Sampath Kumar, were challenging their expulsion on grounds of arbitrariness and their counsel Ravi Shankar Jandhyala told the court that they were not served with the copy of their expulsion till now.
 
 “The expulsion was notified 10 days after we approached the court and we downloaded the gazette notification on our own,” he said. Citing a 1966 Supreme Court order delivered in the Amarender Singh versus State of Punjab case, the judge observed that unless the order is communicated to the parties, the notification cannot be given effect to.
 
 Soon after the court resumed hearing , Telangana additional advocate-general   told the court that they have filed their counter. When the MLAs’ counsel told the court that there was no response from the Assembly secretary, the judge said he cannot compel them to submit to the jurisdiction of the court.
 
 Whether Assembly authorities want to appear or not, it was for them to decide, he said. Jandhyala told the court that the Assembly has no power to expel members. At best, it could suspend them for a few sessions, he said. The judge reserved his orders while observing that the Assembly chose not to furnish the video footage pertaining to the alleged   of the two MLAs though sought by the court.
