Former US President Bill   and his collaborator, bestselling author James  , are looking forward to a film adaptation of their novel 
 , which comes out in June 2018. 

  Alfred A. Knopf and Little, Brown and Company will jointly publish 
  in June 2018. Clinton said in a statement that he is "Working on a book about a sitting President -- drawing on what I know about the job, life in the  , and the way   works -- has been a lot of fun." 
 
  A quote from Patterson’s release read, "I'm a story-teller, and President Clinton's insight has allowed us to tell a really interesting one. It's a rare combination." 
 
  Clinton and Patterson have retained Creative Artists Agency's (CAA)   to handle the rights and plan to meet with potential filmmakers, likely in California, later in the spring, reports hollywoodreporter.com. Clinton and Patterson are also planning to do a book tour and media interviews together to promote the book. 
 
  The publishers said that the book will be filled with “details that only a President can know". The details of the plot are not currently known, but the two men have announced plans to hold a national book tour to promote it. 
 
  James Patterson topped a 2014 Nielsen Book Scan list of top-selling authors of the decade, ahead of J.K. Rowling.   has authored several nonfiction books, including his 2004 biography 
 .
 
  This would be the first book-to-film project for Clinton, who has previously written few books since leaving office in January 2001.
