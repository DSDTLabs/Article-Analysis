Vadodara: Fire Brigade personnel   a   boy in 18 minutes on Tuesday, who had accidentally fallen into a 15-foot deep pit dug for a   at a   near Motnath Mahadev Temple in Harni here.

 Roshan, son of building labourers, was playing at the construction site where his parents were working during which he fell into the pit dug for the borewell. 
 
 His father Alkesh Mahavir called his fellow workers after which the Fire Brigade was informed. 
 
 The Fire Brigade personnel barricaded the area so that there was no landslide there.
 
  “The boy could have slipped further down if the land had slid due to weight so we asked people to leave from there,” said assistant fire officer Om Jadeja. The Fire Brigade officials then created pressure ventilation for Roshan. The fire department personnel tried to rescue the boy by two methods. “We inserted a self-rescue knot and tried the vertical-horizontal excavation method,” added Jadeja. The fire department dug another 15-foot horizontal pit beside the borewell pit with the help of a JCB machine. “It was also necessary that the boy didn’t doze off so we kept him busy by interacting with him constantly,” Jadeja said.
 
 The fire department personnel removed after 18 minutes the boy from the pit through a hole created in another pit that was dug by them. Roshan was taken to a nearby private hospital for a check-up. The fire department is now investigating why the borewell was not filled up by the contractor.
