Gandhinagar: Shankersinh Vaghela, former leader of opposition, said on Wednesday that he won’t contest the assembly elections. However, he said that he will not retire from politics. Shankersinh Vaghela recently resigned from the Congress and also as leader of opposition in the state assembly.

 
 Vaghela had left the Congress claiming that the party was not doing the required homework to win the 2017 elections. “I am not going to contest the assembly polls even if you (journalists) vote for me and support me,” Vaghela said.
 
 Curiously, Vaghela praised the PM and CM’s work for flood relief. He also praised Modi’s decision to visit the flood-affected areas of the North Gujarat. “I welcome the move of PM Modi to visit the flood-affected areas and announcing Rs 500 crore assistance. The PM and the CM both going themselves for aerial observation is good,” Vaghela said. He, however, said that the state’s disaster management had been a failure.
 
 ‘I will follow Anna Hazare, Jayprakashji’When asked about his political plans, Vaghela said he will become a political force like Anna Hazare and Jayprakash Narayanji and play politics for the people.
