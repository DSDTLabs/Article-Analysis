VIJAYAWADA: The slow pace of the storm water drainage project in the city has left denizens furious.

 Larsen and Toubro, which started works in 2016 at major divisions, failed to meet deadlines at most divisions. Lately, the agency increased the pace of works after chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu’s warnings, but locals complain of facing problems.
 
 The denizens of Ranigarithota, Krishnalanka and other slums in the city are facing problems with   wastes spilling on the streets. “Storm water drain works are inconveniencing us severely. VMC is ignoring restoration of the sewerage and consequently roads are being inundated with filthy water, which is spreading mosquito-borne diseases in our area,” said M  , a resident of the 15th division.
 
 Locals rued that the stagnant water on the streets is contaminating the drinking water pipelines. “Officials in the city should learn a lesson from the water contamination that happened in Guntur. Drain water is flowing on the streets and the contract agency, which is handling storm water drains, is ignoring public safety. The civic body should take stringent action before the water gets contaminated,” said   secretary MV Anjaneyulu.
 
 VMC commissioner J Nivas expressed anguish over the unhygienic conditions at Ranigari Thota and other areas in the city with storm water drain works. He said the health and sanitation wings of VMC will take necessary measures to clear stagnated sewage on streets and arrange alternative pipes to lift water.
 
 Nivas directed the officials to make alternative measures to ensure the flow of drains and complete the works fast.
