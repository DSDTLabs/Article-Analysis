MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Tuesday adjourned the case seeking police permission to conduct a fast from April 27 to 30 as a token of protest against   Industries. 

 Anti-Sterlite Movement chief organiser P M   has filed the plea. When it came up for hearing before justice D  , the petitioner’s counsel said, the   in   district rejected the petitioner’s request by passing an order on April 20. Sterlite is continuously damaging the environment through its functioning. To create awareness about it to the state and central governments the movement wanted to hold a protest. 
 
 But, the police without hearing the petitioner’s side rejected the application which was liable to be set aside and it was necessary to issue a direction to the police to give permission for the fasting, the petitioner said. He also said that the place sought for fasting is a regular spot where no traffic problem would happen. The court then adjourned the case to Wednesday.
