NEW DELHI: The   (SP) and the   today confirmed they will contest the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls together. 

 The Samajwadi Party will field 298 candidates, and the Congress 105, the SP's Uttar Pradesh chief   said at a joint conference in Lucknow.
 
 "For the unity and integrity of India, and following a secular ideology, we will continue our fight under SP National president (and Uttar Pradesh chief minister)  ," Naresh Uttam said.
 
 "The country's secular fabric will become stronger when Akhilesh Yadav becomes the chief minister again," he added.
 
 Uttam said the idea was to "uproot" the "communal" BJP, and make Uttar Pradesh a leading state by removing both the BJP and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party.
 
 Congress Uttar Pradesh unit chief   said his party accepted the SP's offer of 105 seats keeping in mind the prevailing situation in the country, and the atmosphere in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 He explained that the two parties had forged an alliance to thwart the BJP's "divisive politics, and at the same time to boost secularism and promote communal and social harmony."
 
 Babbar said the BJP created hardships for people by deciding to implement demonetisation, and that now, people have an opportunity to teach the party "a lesson." 
 
 He added that the alliance between two young leaders - Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi - will ensure that politics transcends the narrow boundaries of caste and religion.
 
 The Congress has managed to wrangle 105 seats for itself. But the party had wanted to contest as many as 121 seats, and it appeared that an alliance may not happen. 
 
 However, the Congress and the SP reached a compromise just before Akhilesh Yadav released the SP's manifesto today.
