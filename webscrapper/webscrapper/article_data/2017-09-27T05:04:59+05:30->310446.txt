NEW DELHI:   on Tuesday issued fresh summons to   leader   and his son   to appear for questioning on October 3 and 4 respectively in connection with Indian Railways corruption case. 

 The CBI rejected the politicians’ plea seeking 15 days’ time for appearing before the investigation team in the case which relates to alleged graft in awarding a contract to a private firm for the maintenance of two railway hotels when Lalu Yadav was the Union railway minister in 2006.
 
 Tejashwi, who was summoned to appear on Tuesday in previous summons, sent his counsel, who submitted a request seeking more time, sources said.
 
 Yadav has now been called on October 3 and Tejashwi on October 4, CBI spokesperson Abhishek Dayal said.
 
 The case pertains to allegations that Yadav, as railway minister, handed over the maintenance of two hotels run by the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, a subsidiary of the Indian Railways, in Ranchi and Puri to Sujata Hotels, a company owned by Vinay and Vijay Kochhar, in return for a prime plot of three acres in Patna through a benami company.
 
 The FIR alleged that the RJD leader abused his official position for extending undue favours to the Kochhars and acquired a piece of “high value premium land” through the benami firm Delight Marketing Company. As a quid pro quo, he “dishonestly and fraudulently” awarded the contract to them for the two hotels. The then IRCTC managing director P K Goel is also named.
