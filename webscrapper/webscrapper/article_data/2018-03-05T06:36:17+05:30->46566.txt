ROHTAK: Angry over being made to pay for crossing a toll barrier right next to their town, the residents of Sampla protested at the toll plaza, located on the Rohtak-Delhi highway, on Sunday and made the staff at payment counters to let vehicles pass for free. 

 Haryana agriculture minister Om Prakash Dhankhar, who was crossing the protest site, was also stopped by protesters. They told him that villages within 8km of   were not being charged any money, but residents of Sampla town were being made to pay for crossing the toll plaza. 
 
 After hearing the demands, Dhankhar said he would discuss thee matter with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and the Union transport minister. He said he was in support of their demands and would try his best to solve their grievance.
 
 Meanwhile, the protesters were joined by   leader Satish Nandal, who also had a brief altercation with cops when they tried to disperse the protesters.
 
 Sampla Nagar Palika chairperson   said employees at the toll plaza would resort to snatching the documents of people’s vehicles if they refused to pay the toll charge. After rounds of heated debate, it was decided the protesters would be allowed a meeting with the sub-divisional magistrate.
 
 West Haryana Highways Project Private Limited general manager Bijender Tiwari said rules made it clear that people would be given a concession and not be allowed to pass for free. 
 
 The official said the decision to provide free pass to residents of the 15 villages within 8km of the plaza was taken because the villagers would end up getting into fights with staff almost daily. “They were not even willing to pay Rs 150 every month,” he said.
