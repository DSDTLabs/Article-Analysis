PUNE:   went atop the   standings with a fighting performance in a come-from-behind 2-1 win over   at the Balewadi stadium here on Wednesday.

 After going behind courtesy Wellington Prior's first-half strike, the home side hit back with a quickfire second half double through defender   and Emiliano Alfaro.
 
 The Stallions have 22 points from 12 games, having played one more game than their closest
 
 rivals   and Chennaiyin FC. Jamshedpur stay in fifth place with 16 points from 12 games.
 
 Jamshedpur started the brighter of the two teams and had their first effort as early as the 4th minute. Winger   cut in from the left and tried to beat Pune keeper Vishal Kaith at his near post but the shotstopper was equal to it. The home side had to wait till the 25th minute for their first shot on target and it came in the form of a cheeky free-kick from the wing by Marcelinho who tried to catch Jamshedpur goalie Subrata Paul off guard but Paul was alert and caught it comfortably.
 
 Wellington Priori then pounced on a miscommunication between Kaith and left-back   to slot the ball into an empty net to give his side the lead.
 
 Striker Izu Azuka almost doubled their advantage in the 36th minute when his backflick went just wide off the far post after some good work down the right wing by Trindade Goncalves.
 
 
 
 
 Englishman Teddy Sheringham has been sacked as ATK chief coach and his deputy   was named interim coach ahead of the team's clash against Chennaiyin FC. Under Sheringham, the defending champions suffered four losses and drew thrice in 10 outings to slip to eighth place in the 10-team standings. "Sheringham is no more the coach. Westwood has taken over as interim coach and will interact with the media. I will speak to (CEO) Raghu (Iyer) and we will shortly make an announcement," ATK co-owner Utsav Parekh said.
