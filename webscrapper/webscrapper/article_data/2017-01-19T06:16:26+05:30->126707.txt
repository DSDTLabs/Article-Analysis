KANPUR:   party workers, led by former coal minister  , on Wednesday held demonstration in front of regional office of   in Kanpur against the Centre’s   move. One senior party worker said that such   will continue till January 23.

 They alleged that the Centre government led by PM Narendra Modi had caused trouble to poor people by its decision of demonetising currency in the name of curbing black money. Several city locals too joined the party workers in the demonstration and raised anti-BJP slogans.
 
 Addressing the gathering, Jaiswal said the decision of demonetization was taken in haste and it reflects the Centre’s authoritarian attitude. It was the poorest execution of any government’s decision witnessed post-independence. Jaiswal even held the Centre responsible for the death of over 200 people after demonetization.
 
 “I challenge BJP to name any rich person of the country who had to stand in queue to exchange their old bills. PM Modi had said that demonetization step is taken to curb black money. But not a single penny could be recovered. Modi only do things which help in gaining popularity by overlooking the sufferings of the poor,” added Jaiswal. 
 
 City president, Congress, Harprakash Agnihotri said traders and farmers were badly affected by this decision. “It was a blind and unprofessional move which made 125 crore people to stand in serpentine queues. And the worst part is that over 200 people lost their life because of this decision,” he added. 
 
 Similar protests were also reported from across the country. Earlier also on November 24, Congress party workers led by Uttar Pradesh Congress Committees president Raj Babbar, had staged a massive demonstration in front of RBI in city to protest against demonetization.
