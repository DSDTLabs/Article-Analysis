JAIPUR: Photographs of inmates playing Holi inside the   have gone viral on social media, debunking tall claims by the Rajasthan jail department that it has ensured tight security in prisons.

 A month ago, Shambhu Lal Raigar, the Rajsamand hate crime accused who is lodged at Jodhpur jail, had posted a video stating he was facing threats in the prison. 
 
 Making complete mockery of the security, at least four inmates have posted   photographs taken in their barracks of the Jaipur Central Jail. Senior jail officials have received the photographs on their instant messaging platforms.
 
 On Sunday, the state government ordered a probe and asked officials to submit a report within three days. Authorities also conducted search operations at the Jaipur Central Jail as well as other prisons. “An official order would be issued on Monday. But I have already asked officials to investigate the matter. They have also been asked to conduct searches in prisons. It is a serious issue. We would chalk out a strategy to deal with such incidents,” Bhupendra Singh, ADG, jails, told TOI on Sunday.
