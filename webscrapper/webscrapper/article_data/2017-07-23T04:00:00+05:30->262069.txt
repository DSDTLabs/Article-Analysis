Ahmedabad: Rains continued to lash the city unabated as many Amdavadis chose to remain indoors on Saturday. The city received average 65.71mm rainfall from 6 am to 10 pm. This is by far the highest rain received on a single day this season. In several areas like Valinath Chowk, Jaymangal BRTS stretch, Pallav Crossroads, complaints of waterlogging were reported. In the West zone, Chandkheda received the highest rainfall of 119.5 mm from 6am to 10pm on Saturday.

 In the East and North zones, to,o there were issues of drainage spills and waterlogging complaints from several areas. In several areas of Nikol and Bapunagar, citizens moved around knee-deep and waist-deep water for several hours. 
 
 “Both roads flanking the Kharicut canal were waterlogged. Many societies located alongside the canal could not move for around for several hours,” said a resident Satish Patel. 
 
 One of the worst affected stretches was on 132 feet Ring Road, from Helmet Flyover to Shastrinagar Crossroads. Since there was waterlogging at Helmet Crossroads, traffic police diverted people towards the flyover. However, the move did no good as it led to severe traffic congestion right from Helmet Flyover to AEC Flyover till Shastrinagar and Pragatinagar BRTS stops.
 
 “I had to turn towards Drive-In Road, but since the road was waterlogged, I had no option but to take the Helmet Flyover. Going further, as I descended the flyover, there was heavy waterlogging. At one point, I almost thought my car will stop and not start. It was scary and tiring,” said Falguni Patel, a commuter. 
 
 At places where there was no waterlogging, citizens had their own troubles as potholes and dug-up stretches of roads slowed traffic. “Every day I take the road from Thaltej to Mithakhali and at some point, I am invariably at the mercy of bad roads,” said Rebecca Sudan, an entrepreneur.
