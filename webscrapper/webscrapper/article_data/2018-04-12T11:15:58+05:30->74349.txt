PANAJI: Five Goa students, all from Panaji’s  , have cleared the national test for selection to the central government’s Kishore Vigyanik Protsahan Yojana ( ) scholarship.  , of the same school, has become only the second Goan to clear the exam while still studying in Class XI.

 PS Anand was the first to bag the scholarship when in Class XI in 2014. Gurav, however, has earned a rank of 483, as against Anand’s 295. KVPY is a scholarship introduced by the government to encourage students to continue their education in science by pursuing BSc, MSc, etc, rather than rush into specialised streams like engineering and medicine. Students start getting the scholarship amount and incentives like full payment to attend national-level science conferences only after they enrol for a pure sciences programme after Class XII.
 
 This year, at the Class XII level, the students selected for KVPY scholarship are Aumkar Shah (rank 364), Sanmesh Bale (rank 830),   (rank 962), and   (rank 1793).
 
 “It has become a matter of prestige for students to call themselves KVPY scholars,” said Mushtifund Aryaan HSS principal Vynkatesh Prabhudesai.
