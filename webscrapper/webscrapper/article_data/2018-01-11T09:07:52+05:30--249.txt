ALLAHABAD: A Kaushambi-based woman, who was given   over the phone by her husband three days ago, appealed to Prime Minister   for help on Tuesday. 

 Rozi Begum, 35, from   town was married to Mohammad Sohrab alias Aslam for the last 17 years. However, on Sunday Aslam allegedly called off their marriage. He had also taken their three children - Suhail, 13,  , 11 and  , 9 - to some unknown location two months ago.
 
 Appealing to the PM to take action against Aslam and reunite her with her children, Begum said that her husband had been torturing her for the last three years. She also alleged that he wanted to push her into flesh trade.
 
 Begum said she did not get any financial assistance from Aslam and was providing for her children by working as a domestic help. She said she approached Manjhanpur police but they did not take any action against her husband.
 
 "I kept silent, keeping the future of my sons in mind," she said, adding that she had enrolled the three in a madrassa but Aslam went to the institution two months ago and took them to an unknown location.
 
 A few days after her children went missing, she started getting phone calls from unknown numbers. "During one such call on Sunday, the caller handed over the phone to my husband, who called off the marriage saying talaq three times," she said.
 
 Kaushambi SP   told TOI that he had ordered Manjhanpur police to investigate the matter.
 
 "No one has contacted me about the issue. I came to know about it when local reporters asked me about police action taken into the woman's complaint," he said on Tuesday.
