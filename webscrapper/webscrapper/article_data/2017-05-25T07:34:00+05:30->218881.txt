AMRITSAR: With the philanthropic campaign launched by him post the Manchester terror attack, 24-year-old Arjun Singh hopes it will go a long way in acceptance of the Sikh community in the United Kingdom. Sikhs have come out in large numbers to help Mancunians following the deadly suicide attack at   on Monday that left 22 dead and over 59 injured.

 Arjun, known as AJ to his friends and acquaintances, has not only put a ‘free taxi’ sign on his vehicle but also arranged two hundred taxis from Manchester and nearby towns to provide free rides to the victims, taking them wherever they wanted to go. He said all drivers in the group, irrespective of their ethnicity, had turned off their meters and were ferrying the injured to gurdwaras, Hindu temples or to different cities like London and Birmingham. Various Hindu temples like   had also opened their doors while as many as 80 people had prepared food at Gurdwara Guru Gobind Singh, he added.
 
 “I myself gave more than 15 rides,” said AJ while talking to TOI over phone from Manchester on Wednesday. Stating that there had been incidents of Sikhs being bullied in the past, he hoped that such incidents would not take place in Manchester anymore. “People have seen turbaned Sikhs helping others,” he added.
 
 
  
  
 
 Prayers were being offered at St Peters Square and a candle light vigil was held to remember those who lost their lives in the deadly attack. United Sikhs director Sun Kaur said gurdwaras were still open for those looking for shelter and food. 
 
 Meanwhile in wake of the recent terror attack and government’s decision to increase the terror threat level from severe to critical, UK based Sikh body   has urged the government to postpone general elections scheduled to be held on June 8. General secretary of the federation Narinderjit Singh said, “We must show respect for the children killed and give time for the families and nation to grieve.”
