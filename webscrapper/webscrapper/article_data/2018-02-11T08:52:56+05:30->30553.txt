NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket board (BCCI) has decided to advance its meeting with the captains and the coaches of teams in order to smoothen out the domestic calendar. It is learnt that newly appointed   general manager (cricket ops)   has scheduled the meeting on Feb 28, a day after the   tournament final.

 
 Usually the meeting happens after the conclusion of the IPL but this time there will be two tournaments — Deodhar Trophy and Irani Cup — left to play when the meeting takes place. “The remaining two tournaments are played between teams picked by the senior selection committee, barring the Ranji champions who play the Irani Cup. It’s a good time to discuss the problems as they are fresh in the mind,” a top BCCI official told TOI.
 
 The domestic calendar had to be reworked a few times this season, starting with accommodating the Duleep Trophy. The limited-overs tournaments too had to be rejigged once the season got under way. According to sources, this is the reason why chairman of the selection committee   has also been invited to the meeting, besides chairman of the technical committee and the chairman of the grounds and pitches committee.
 
 The other pressing issue would be to see if it’s viable to go back to the relegation system in Ranji Trophy. There have been a few reservations about the current format, in which the teams were equally divided in four groups.
 
 Hazare knockouts shifted to Delhi
 
 Meanwhile, the   knockouts from Feb 21 have been shifted to Delhi from Lucknow because of a problem of accommodation due to an investors’ summit.
