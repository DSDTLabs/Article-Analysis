CHENNAI: They have literally and figuratively stood the test of time. Now, the state forest department and the   Company have brought out a   book ‘Heritage Trees of Tamil Nadu’, listing 50 trees, each more than 200 years old.

 Former forest force head and principal chief conservator of forests C K Sreedharan said more than 100 trees were identified before the figure was pruned to 50 as the age of the others couldn’t be calculated.
 
 While the age was based on the structure, circumference and growth pattern, rarity as well as spiritual, aesthetic, botanical, ecological and historic value were also considered. 
 
 Information collected by range officers from different districts was verified by the deputy conservator of forests and passed to the research wing. 
 
 Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (research and education) R K Upadhyay said the effort on the book was part of a programme aimed at promoting natural heritage.
 
 Sreedharan said he had seen at least 25 of the 50 trees listed, most of which had grown naturally. It took more than a year to collect pictures and details and another year complete the book, he said.
 
 Adansonia digitata (Aanai puliyamaram) found in Rajapalayam of Virudhunagar district; Ailanthus excelsa (Pi naari maram) of Sirumugai range in Coimbatore district; Albizia saman (Thoongu vagai) of Government museum, Chennai; and Artocarpus heterophyllus (Pala) of   in Salem’s   area are among those listed.
 
 It was under the banyan tree (Ficus bengalensis) at Bithreddy village in   district that the army of Tippu Sultan rested after attacking the Cheranaadu kings more than 200 years ago, Sreedharan said, based on information gathered from various sources.
