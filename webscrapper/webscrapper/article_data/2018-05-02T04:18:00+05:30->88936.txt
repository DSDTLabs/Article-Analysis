Vadodara: The Vishwamitri river is all set to have its first check dam soon. The state government has accepted a proposal to build a check dam on the river in Paldi village near Halol. Community science centre chairman M H Mehta said on Tuesday that once the check dam is constructed, the area around the river will get irrigation facilities and the underground water table too will go up.

 “We had been making efforts to convince the state irrigation department for last two years. Finally they have agreed to build a check dam on Vishwamitri river. We also held talks with the local villagers who have given their nod,” Mehta told TOI. “It will help us in rejuvenating the river and also improve underground water table,” Mehta said.
 
 The issue will be discussed during the 4th National Round Table on Model River Revival System organized under the Vaho Vishwamitri Abhiyan (VVA) at community science centre on Thursday. The VVA was initiated as a people’s movement for reviving 135-kilometer long Vishwamitri river. Experts from the areas of agriculture, water and delegates from municipal corporations, councillors and collector office will attend the conference.
 
 “If even 15 per cent of the annual rainfall is stored in the Vishwamitri River, we can have much more water than Ajwa Lake. Vishwamitri needs to have seven check-dams that won’t be above the height of the river. Also, lakhs of trees have to be planted on the banks of the river to create a bio-shield,” said Dr Jitendra Gavali of the community science centre. 
 
 Mehta said that even the tributaries flowing in Vishwamitri river have to be kept clean. “The state government has already sanctioned Rs 8 crore for cleaning and reviving Bhuki nala that passes from M S University,” he said.
