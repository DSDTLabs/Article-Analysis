BENGALURU: A city consumer court has ordered  ,  , to refund the payment it had collected from a north Bengaluru customer for a washing machine. 

 The store had refused to deliver the machine, claiming that the debit card transaction had failed. It was ordered to pay Chitransh   Rs 31,689, the price of the washing machine price, and Rs 5,000 for all the problems it had caused him.
 
 Shrivatsava, 31, from  , walked into the store on January 7, 2017 and decided to buy a washing machine. He had handed over his   debit card and the store staff swiped the card for Rs 31,689.
 
  The amount was debited from his account, but   staff refused to hand over the machine, stating it wasn't credited to their merchant account. They claimed the swipe returned a failed transaction. 
 
 While the banking enquiries went on, Shrivatsava purchased the machine from the same store using another card days later. He then followed up with SBI on the first transaction and learnt from the customer care that the money had been credited to Croma's bank account.
 
 The Bengalurean contacted the store and Croma agreed that it had received the money. It assured Shrivatsava that they would credit the money to his bank account. But the money wasn't refunded despite Shrivatsava calling the store several times to remind them about it.
 
  Finally, he approached the   2nd additional district consumer disputes redressal forum on May 6, 2017 with a complaint against Croma. While he submitted bank documents in court to prove his claim, Croma representatives failed to appear despite a legal notice. 
 
 The judges criticised Croma for receiving double payment from the customer and failing to refund his money and for making him run around for months.
 
 In its verdict, the forum ordered Croma to refund Rs 31,689 to Shrivatsava within 30 days and pay an additional Rs 5,000 to him for all the trouble caused.
