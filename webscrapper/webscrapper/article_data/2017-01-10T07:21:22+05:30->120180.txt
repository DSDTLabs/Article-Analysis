PUNE: An expert panel at a conference on Monday surmised that a specialised  ' as a single-point agency is needed to resolve issues plaguing the rivers flowing through the city.

 The panel has decided to compile a vision document to act as a blueprint for authorities to tackle restoration of the city's rivers. They hope to submit this document to authorities within the next 10 days.
 
 The conference titled `Muthakaran' was organized by city-based Biospheres and the Bharati Vidyapeeth Institute of   and Research as part of the Kirloskar Vasundhara International Film Festival.
 
 “Various observations like lack of laws against exploitation of native species dependent on rivers, illegal developments along river banks, the Metro corridor, pending cases before the  , activism and flood were discussed,“ Sachin Punekar of Biospheres said.
 
 “A major hurdle in restoration of the five rivers passing through the city ­ Mula, Mutha, Devnadi, Ramnadi and Pavana ­ is the confusion over the ownership of the water bodies,“ he said.
 
 “With a unified body of local and government representatives, this will be the one stop shop for all issues pertaining to rivers,“ he added.
