AURANGABAD: Shetkari   (Maharashtra), a city-based social organisation fighting for the cause of farmers, on Sunday said the Central government should intervene and announce   for the drought-affected farmers in the state.

 Emphasising on the need to support the farmers reeling under pressure of adverse climatic conditions, social activist and president of the organisation   said Prime Minister   should take a call on the matter at the earliest.
 
 “Despite strong demand from opposition party leaders, Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government has managed to skip the crucial issue. Various social groups and political parties have been demanding the state government to waive off loans of the farmers considering the financial crises they are going through. If the Uttar Pradesh government could announce loan waiver scheme and help the farmers, why cannot we do it in Maharashtra?” he asked.
 
 Dhoble further said the Prime Minister, while visiting the state in mid-April, should personally review the condition of the farmers and take a decision.
 
 He felt the loan waiver scheme would save lives of thousands of small and marginal farmers especially in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions. “All the affected farmers must be relieved of financial burden and brought to the mainstream society. The loan waivers will also bring down the cases of farmer suicides,” he added.
 
 On the other hand MIM MLA Imtiaz Jaleel recently said that he is not in favour of loan waiver for all the farmers. “Loan waiver scheme is not required for all the farmers as there are many who can afford to repay it. However, there are others who genuinely need a helping hand. Thus, the government should consider helping them,” he said.
