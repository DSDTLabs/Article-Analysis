 (MP): PM   praised   on Monday for turning the conservation of its “lifeline”, the  , into a “mass movement”, and urged other states to follow its example in their own river-cleaning campaigns.

 The plea was a clear message to states that have so far not been successful in carrying out the Centre's ambitious  .
 
 Referring to the state’s time-bound plan, he said no programme could be successfully implemented without the involvement of people, no matter what kind of policy it has or how effective the leadership is. “The biggest strength of democracy is ‘jan bhagidari’ (people’s participation). 
 
 We are seeing great enthusiasm in people here to save the river Narmada,”   said, addressing a function to mark the conclusion of the ‘Narmada Sewa Yatra’, which was flagged off on December 11 last year as part of a campaign to create awareness among the masses for rejuvenating the Narmada.
 
 He also released MP’s action plan that details with timelines how the state would go about reviving Narmada’s sources of water to the river through a massive plantation exercise in the catchment area and also along the banks of the river that originates from Amarkantak.
 
 “I wish this document should go to all states so that they can emulate it for their respective river rejuvenation plan,” said Modi. There are many rivers in India, he said, that are visible only on the map and non-existent on the ground.
 
 MP’s Narmada action plan lays great emphasis on afforestation as trees, with their water retention\absorption capacities, in the Vindhyas are the main source of water to the river and its tributaries.
