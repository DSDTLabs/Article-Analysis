NASHIK: The massive response to   services has moved   division of   (MSRTC) to double the services on the route. 

 Shivshahi buses on Pune,  , Dhule, Nandurbar are getting tremendous response. However, only few commuters take the services to Borivali and  , said officials. 
 
 "We have got two buses in Nashik and three buses in Aurangabad. They will add up to eight trips between the cities - increasing the total numbers of trips to 16 daily from each side," a senior official from the MSRTC, Nashik office, said. 
 
 The buses are likely to arrive at the Nashik and Aurangabad divisions next week. "We have received the communication about the allocation of the buses, which are likely to arrive at Nashik in the middle of next week," the official added. 
 
 Commuters to Aurangabad are finding the service very satisfying. MSRTC was initially hesitant to launch the service to Aurangabad given the response to Hirkani, which was the regular non-AC semi luxury buses. 
 
 "The road beyond Yeola towards Aurangabad after crossing Nashik district is not very good for small vehicles. Now that the government-run air conditioned buses are available, I have stopped using my car on the route,"  , a businessman, who frequently travels to Aurangabad, said. 
 
  "The bus is convenient and safe for me to travel alone. Since the launch of Shivshahi, I have not travelled by the private bus at all," said Sarla Potdar.
 
 However, those keen on travelling to Bandra and Dadar in Mumbai, do not find the services very helpful. "Going to Bandra from Borivali or Mumbai Central is a tedious task. I will wait for MSRTC to start services for Bandra or Dadar," Kedar Shah, businessman from Nashik having business in Bandra, said.
