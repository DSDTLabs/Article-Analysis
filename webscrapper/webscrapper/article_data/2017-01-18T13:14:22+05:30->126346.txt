THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The district administration is planning to form small groups comprising students to maintain an area, a water body, park or a portion of beach under Haritha Keralam project. In a special meeting held here on Tuesday, district collector S Venkatesapathy pitched the idea to representatives of  ,NSS and student police cadets. He said that of the 15,000 Haritha Keralam projects, 3500 projects have been completed.

 "NCC and   members have been undertaking water conservation and afforestation activities but those activities were not made a part of   mission. Children should be a part of this mission and the message of Haritha Keralam should reach elders through the students, said Venkatesapathy.
  
 As part of the idea, a special area can be chosen close to schools or colleges. Activities like afforestation, creating awareness, conservation of water sources can be conducted by the students in these areas. The project will be implemented in association with DTPC. Ambassadors will be chosen from amongst the students. Concepts like vertical garden will be promoted to overcome space restraints as part of the project.   secretary Prasanth, co-ordinators of NCC, NSS, SPC were also present in the meeting.
