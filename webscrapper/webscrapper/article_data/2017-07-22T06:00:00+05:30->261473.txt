With the festive season here, the cityâ€™s fashion-conscious are busy hopping from one   to another across the city. One such fair saw a bunch of socialites zealously filling their shopping carts with designer clothes, funky  ,  , accessories and rakhi for the upcoming festival. Lugging around their heavy shopping bags, they flocked to the food stalls dotting the venue and dug into some fast food. An afternoon well spent!
