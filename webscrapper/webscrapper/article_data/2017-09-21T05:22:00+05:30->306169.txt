Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court on Wednesday sought a reply on Friday from the AMC over renting its public garden in Bodakdev to private event organizers who organize garba during Navratri. A PIL claimed that the AMC has got plots for commercial purpose but it cannot give public parks for such events. Private companies have even created a food market in such public spaces. The petitioners stated that last year, the AMC rented the public park for garba festivities which had caused problems for people living in the neighbourhood. Even morning walkers and joggers were prevented from entering the park.
