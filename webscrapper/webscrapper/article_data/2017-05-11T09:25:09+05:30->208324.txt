NASHIK: The restriction on construction near   establishments has angered the  , which has sought civic chief Abhishek Krishna’s intervention in the matter.

 The ministry of defence in its October 21, 2016 notification relaxed the construction norms at several places, including Maharashtra, by reducing the radius to 100 metre. Nashik was not a part of this list. 
 
 The restriction by MoD was not mentioned in the development plans of 1993, 2003 and 2015. But, in 2015, the MoD announced the new norm. The ministry’s GR said that there should be no construction on the boundary of the defence area till 100 metres and buildings of only 15 meter height should be constructed. Last year, while several cities got relaxation on the norm, Nashik was left out.
 
 On Tuesday, MP Hemant Godse, Shivaji Sahane and leader of opposition   met Krishna. “I will study the documents and see what can be done. Generally, a letter is given to the defence establishment and they have to reply within 30 days. If they do not respond, it is considered to have been allowed,” said Krishna.
