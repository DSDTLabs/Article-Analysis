LUCKNOW: For a fresh glass of nutritious   one need not wait for the season or visit a vendor as   could be available round the year. Indian Institute of Toxicology and Research and Indian Institute of Sugarcane and Research are working jointly on a technology that will help preserve the juice for 3-5 months. The technology will increase shelf life of sugarcane juice and raise prospects of its marketing as a beverage.

 “The technology will reduce bacteria in the juice and help preserve its freshness for longer,” said   director Alok Dhawan, adding that bacteria and yeast lead to its quick fermentation and the technology will curb that. He also said companies may bid for the technology for packing and marketing sugarcane juice.
 
 He also said unlike other packed juices, sugarcane will not require adding water, sugar or other juices and can be packed in its purest form. “The juice is loaded with carbohydrates, proteins and minerals like calcium and phosphorus making it a healthy drink that can be consumed even by  , hence it would find many takers,” said Dhawan.
