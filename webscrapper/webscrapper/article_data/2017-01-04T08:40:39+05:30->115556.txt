BENGALURU: Oblivious to the outrage over the alleged mass   of women during New Year’s Eve celebrations in the heart of the city, Bengaluru police on Tuesday said   footage from the revelry hotspots of   and Brigade Road showed no evidence of such an incident. 

 The alleged incidents of molestation made national headlines, raising questions about the safety of women in the country’s IT hub. Senior police officers have appealed to victims and eyewitnesses to come forward and record their statements. 
 
 Malini Krishnamurty, additional commissioner of police (west), said, “We want to assure people that we are taking these allegations seriously and will investigate every statement given.” Video footage from over 80 different cameras — CCTV, handheld and mobile phone — is being scanned. The Traffic Management Centre of the Bengaluru police, which has a video wall, is being used for the purpose, said a police source. 
 
 “There has to be a case for us to register a case, and it should be taken to court. We need clear footage showing such an incident or a statement from a victim. We neither have any evidence nor have any of the eyewitnesses or victims, who are speaking to the media, met us,” said another senior police officer. 
 
 The source claimed that a probe was on and police were checking closed-circuit television footage from the spots. Some of the photographs carried by the media were of revellers being helped by cops and not of victims of molestation, he said. 
 
 Police have asked media houses to provide them footage of the alleged molestation they have. Enquiry conducted by a DCP rank officer has gone through feed from 45 cameras situated at Bangaluru’s MG Road. Unedited video is available with police.
