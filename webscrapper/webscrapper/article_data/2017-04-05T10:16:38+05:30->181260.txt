NEW DELHI: A day after BJP declared its list of candidates for the municipal elections, a tussle was on at   ward on Tuesday as two party workers have filed nominations from the same seat.

 Pooja Sehgal, who was given ticket in the first list, met Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari on Tuesday to clarify the issue as Vandana Jaitley also filed her papers from the same seat.
 
 Vandana’s name was declared in the last list of 10 wards, which was stuck due to disagreement between senior party members. Sehgal said that she got the party symbol on Sunday night and had filed her nomination in the morning. The party declared the last list on Monday afternoon in which Vandana was given ticket for the same ward.
 
 “I got to know about Jaitley’s nomination after I filed my own. I have requested Manoj Tiwari to clarify the issue. He has assured me that proper process will be followed to finalise the name,” said Pooja, who had come to the state unit office along with her other members.
 
 BJP members said that the party had changed a few candidates from the first list following disagreement within senior leadership and that the final decision in this regard will be taken soon.
