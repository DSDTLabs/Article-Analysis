NEW DELHI: For effective utilisation of the funds meant to improve infrastructure in 5,200 SC clusters, the AAP government has decided to widen the scope of work under the scheme. With 23 types of new work, the scheme has been renamed as   under   Sub Plan.

 Following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said new services would include development of parks and sports complexes; construction of gymnasiums, library, dispensaries, main drains, reservoirs and overhead water tanks for DJB water; laying of water and sewer lines; installing streetlights and CCTVs; and setting up vocational schools.
 
 Sisodia said the government couldn’t spend the funds earlier due to the limited scope of work. “We could only construct or repair public toilets, drains, roads and pavements, and chaupals. The scope has been widened so that we can carry out other infrastructure projects which are required. We have allocated Rs 50 crore under the scheme.” 
 
 The government also plans to use it for construction of subways, and development of burial grounds, foot overbridges, bus stops and bus queue shelters.
 
 Officials said that even   had repeatedly stressed on the need to widen the scope of the scheme. The projects under the scheme are taken up by the department concerned on the request of the area MLA, residents or their associations.
