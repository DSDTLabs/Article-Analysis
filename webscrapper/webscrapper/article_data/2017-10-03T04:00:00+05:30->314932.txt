Surat: Number of women patients and their relatives coming to Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER) were put in an embarrassing situation when a woman security guard began to touch them inappropriately in full public view during routine security check at the entry point of the hospital here on Monday. 

 The woman security guard continued with her abominable act despite knowing that a person had shot a video. The video was later given to SMIMER officials and a complaint registered which forced them to discontinue this security practice.
 
 “I went to SMIMER and noticed the harassment. The women were embarrassed, but the security guard continued with her act,” Congress councillor from Kapodara ward of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) Bhavesh Rabari said.
 
 “I told the security guard to stop checking women in this particular manner. However, the security guard said she has been instructed by higher officials. If they want to check in this manner, it should be done in a covered enclosure. SMC and SMIMER authorities should make proper arrangements to ensure that patients don’t suffer. People come to get treated at the hospital, not suffer insults,” Rabari said.
 
 Resident medical officer, SMIMER, Dr Jayesh Patel said, “Security check of women will be conducted only in a covered enclosure. The current practice has been discontinued.”
