MANGALURU: Former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda on Sunday visited the residence of slain   activist   and offered condolences to the bereaved family.

 “Amma…I cannot bring back your son. All I can do is offer you my condolences,” the national president of JD(S) said as tears rolled down Premalatha’s cheeks.
 
 “My younger ( ) son can neither hear nor speak. Deepu was the bread winner for the family. What do I do now,” a sobbing   asked.
 
 After maintaining silence for a couple of minutes, Gowda enquired about Deepak, the family’s background with B M  , state general secretary, JD(S), and left the house as volunteers from the party stormed to catch a glimpse of their national leader.
 
 Gowda spent less than five minutes in the house after arriving at the venue four hours later than anticipated. The police on the other hand rued that they had been put on security duty since morning anticipating the arrival of the JD(S) supremo, who arrived at the residence of Deepak after participating in a private function. Gowda, while leaving, said he will speak on the issue on Monday.
 
 Earlier chief minister had promised a job to Sathish at Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited or any other government job. A few days ago, Union minister for skill development and entrepreneurship Anantkumar Hegde had ordered the officials concerned to give him a job at the Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Limited.
