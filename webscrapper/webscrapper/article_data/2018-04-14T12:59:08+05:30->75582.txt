COIMBATORE: The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the murder of Hindu Munnani spokesperson C Sasikumar, has issued summons to four functionaries of Popular Front of India (PFI), asking them to appear before its office in Hyderabad to collect information about the four accused in the case.

 NIA, which took up the case from the special investigation division of CB-CID on February 22, have already filed chargesheet against the two accused, B   of   and S Zubair of Ukkadam, before the special court for NIA cases at Poonamallee in Chennai.
 
 The investigation agency has also plans to file chargesheet against the two other accused, Mubarak and Syed Abudhakir, before the court. While Mubarak is in police custody, Abudhakir is now out on bail. Having mentioned about the arrested persons’ links with PFI in the chargesheet, NIA has now summoned PFI’s national executive committee member A S Ismail, its district secretary   and members Jaleel, of Podanur and Habib Rahman, of Rathinapuri, to appear before its office in Hyderabad on April 18.
 
 Earlier, NIA had issued summons to PFI state president P Mohammed Ismail, asking him to appear before it in Chennai to collect information about the four arrested. However, PFI leaders had then sought three weeks’ time for collecting and providing information.
 
 When contacted, PFI state secretary   said A S Ismail and Abbas were summoned by NIA and he was not aware about the summons issued to its two cadres. “PFI has a strong hold in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. NIA worked well during the Congress regime. After BJP taking charge, the agency had been targeting PFI. We will fight this legally,” he said.
