He may have done several action films over the years, but   says that he doesn’t want to be branded as an action hero. The reason? “There is a maturity in me now, which reflects in the roles that I have been accepting. I seek out family-oriented films, with action as a base. Why action? Because action is needed in life, and not just in movies. Haven’t you ever felt like hitting someone at some point? We simply take that emotion and show it colourfully in films,” says Vijay.

 The movie sees many firsts for Vijay — it’s his first film with director  , his first with   and  , and it is also the first time that he is playing an auto driver, and a fan of Dr  . Now, that’s a lot to look out for. “Yes. Chandru is known for his family entertainers and   is a film for the entire family, which everyone, especially girls, will enjoy from start to finish. My character is a fan of Annavaru (Dr Rajkumar) and after watching the film, everyone in the audience will also become his fan, if not one already. That’s because there are several morals that are inspired by him in the film. And not just Annavaru; Kanaka speaks of the influence that other great actors — be it Vishnuvardhan,   or   — have had on all of us,” says Vijay.
 
 With such a strong message, what was the mood like on the sets? “Everyone was very professional. We were all aware of the seriousness in the script, and the fun elements as well, and in keeping with that, the entire team did a wonderful job. I have great respect for Chandru; he is a passionate director and doesn’t see films as a business. All this reflects in the final product,” says Vijay, signing off.
