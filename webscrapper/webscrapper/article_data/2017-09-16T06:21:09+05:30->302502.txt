AGRA: Over two lakh youth workers of   in Uttar Pradesh will be prepared to become “dharam yodhas“ (religious warriors) after they receive the “trishul diksha“ on the 25th anniversary of   demolition on December 6 this year.

 Vishwa  's secretary in charge of `dharam prasaar' (propagation of faith) in west UP, Rakesh Tyagi, said these “yodhas“ would protect Hindu religion. “If anyone tries to demolish a temple, attack the Hindu religion, kills cows, or wage love jihad, these yodhas would deal with them,“ Tyagi said.
 
 Maintaining that trishul is the symbol of confidence and power of Lord Shiva,  's international joint general secretary Surendra Jain said that “trishul diksha“ happens all across the country . “It is left to the state units to decide when they want to do,“ he said, adding that the underlying message of their move is that Hindus would not tolerate any form of aggression.
 
 Tyagi claimed that trishuls are not classified as weapons and hence can be used to protect the Hindu religion. “It is time Hindu youth came for ward to protect their religion,“ Tyagi said.
 
 Bajrang Dal's national convenor Manoj Verma said that a few units are conducting the trishul diksha programme after completing their membership recruitment drive between November 19 and December 6. The outfit plans to recruit 5 lakh new youths in UP to prepare them for “Hindutva“.
