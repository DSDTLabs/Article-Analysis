 upped the stakes of public display of affection in   by a few notches when he shared a picture in which he’s seen passionately kissing his wife  . “Thankyou my love ª (sic),” read the caption Mahesh posted along with the image that he shared on Instagram. And within minutes, the picture went viral on social media, triggering a deluge of ‘likes’, ‘awws’ and adorable emoticons. By Sunday morning, it got over two lakh likes and counting. 

 We dug a little deeper to find out what exactly is the story behind the picture. Turns out it was clicked at Mahesh’s residence on Saturday. City-based entrepreneur, Xavier Augustin, a close friend of Mahesh who clicked the picture reveals, “My wife (Sabina) and I were at Mahesh and Namrata’s for a quiet evening. It was just us and our kids watching the movie, eating, chatting and generally celebrating. Like always, I keep 
 taking casual photographs of everything and I captured this sweet candid moment between this lovely happy couple.”
  Apparently, the picture was meant for a private wall in Mahesh’s house that has some of the most cherished moments Mahesh and Namrata shared together. Seems like it was just one of those spontaneous expressions of love that Mahesh decided to share. Sweet, we say.
