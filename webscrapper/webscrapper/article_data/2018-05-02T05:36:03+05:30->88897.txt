PANAJI: Developing infrastructure for tourism sector has not been a priority of the government, said urban development   Francis D’Souza.

 Commenting on the state-of-affairs in the tourism sector, D’Souza said, “We lack basic facilities. After mining, tourism is the highest revenue-generating industry yet efforts to attract high-end tourists are missing.”
 
 The government has failed to create necessary infrastructure in the coastal belt, he added. On an average, a tourist’s stay should be for a week or a more, but then there has to be more on offer to let, especially families, extend their stay beyond two-three days, the minister said, adding that families do not come for booze nor drugs. 
 
 He said some of the projects planned by the government, like the ropeway and aquarium have not come taken off yet. Also, the state has to be “clean and safe for tourists,” he said.
 
 “The safety aspect has also not been taken up seriously,” he said, referring to the unnatural deaths of two foreign nationals. 
 
 
 
 
 The deaths of British minor Scarlett Keeling and backpacker Danielle McLaughlin, who was raped and murdered in Canacona year ago — led to a lot of bad publicity for the state,” D’souza said.
 
 He said though tourist hotspots such as Calangute and Candolim are safe, the same cannot be said about the remote areas, pointing out that the state registered 322 rape cases in the last four years.. 
 
 “It’s a serious matter. The recent being the case of a minor who was sexually assaulted by three men in South Goa,” he said, adding that such incidents do not portray the state in a good light.
 
 “The problem cannot be tackled by handing over capital punishment to those found guilty. We would see the desired change only when we learn to respect woman,” the minister said.
