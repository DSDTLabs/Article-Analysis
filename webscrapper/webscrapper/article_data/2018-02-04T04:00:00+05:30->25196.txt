Vadodara: Many commuters travelling on busy Sama-Savli Road on Saturday morning were surprised when the police stopped them. The commuters were confused as they had either worn helmets or had put on seat belts in their car and usually those flouting rules are stopped by police. Another surprise came when the cops gave them coupons to have free lunch or dinner with their family at a restaurant in Sama. They later learnt that they were given these coupons as they were abiding by the law. Cops at Sama police station had planned the event for Saturday morning for traffic awareness as a part of Traffic Awareness Week which is being observed across the state.  “The idea was to honour those who abide the rules. On normal days, the police penalize those who do not wear helmets or put on seat belts, but those who do it obediently are not recognized therefore we planned the event for the Traffic Awareness Week,” said P D Parmar, police inspector, Sama police station. The police had tied up with two restaurants in Sama and distributed 50 such coupons to the commuters. “With 50 coupons distributed, at least 200 people will be able to have free meals,” said Parmar, adding that he had planned a similar event earlier in Ahmedabad when he was posted there.
