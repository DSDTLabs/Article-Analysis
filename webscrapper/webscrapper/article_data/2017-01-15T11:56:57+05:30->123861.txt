BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister   has accused the Centre of conspiring against the state in matters relating to its rivers. Addressing a conference of the BJD's legal front, the party president said on Saturday: "Odisha has been repeatedly denied of its rights on the rivers flowing through it. Both in Polavaram and Mahanadi, we have been a victim of central neglect and conspiracy." 

 His tirade against the Centre comes just days after the CBI raided the homes of  ,   and Naveen aide   in connection with the   chit fund scam.
