PUNE: The Film and Television Institute of India has received approval from the national   council, ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship, to conduct skill-oriented short courses under the project category of Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana. 

 The approval grants   the status to conduct film- and television- related skill development courses in Pune, Guwahati, Jaipur and Visakhapatnam.
 
 The qualification packs approved are editor, make up artist, character designer, story board artist, painter, camera operator, and similar other roles. 
 
 After the governing and academic councils approved the initiative in November 2016, the institute moved a proposal to NSDC seeking funds.
 
 “This is a major boost to the plans to take short courses to smaller cities. The funding under PMKVY will help lower course fees. The NSDC approval is a quantum jump in the direction of FTII’s efforts to democratize film education, and it’s a milestone equal in importance with the recent master’s degree granted to six FTII post graduate courses,” director  , said .
