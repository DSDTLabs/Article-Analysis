MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the   to remove from the premises of 12 petrol pumps signboards declaring their toilets available for the general public under the Swachh Bharat Mission.

 A bench of Justices Abhay Oka and   heard a petition challenging BMC’s December 22, 2017, notice to retail outlets to make available toilets for use by general public free of cost and to put up signboards. “It appears guidelines published by Swachh Bharat Mission do not authorise the municipal corporation to declare that toilets available at petrol pumps are available for public. Such act is prima facie illegal,” said the bench.
 
 The interim order came on a petition by Petrol Owners’ Association and 12 petrol pumps in Masjid Bunder, Andheri, Bandra and Matunga. The bench said relief was only for 12 pumps.
