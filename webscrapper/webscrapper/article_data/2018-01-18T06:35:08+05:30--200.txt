MUMBAI: “Everyone was very happy when I was born but soon everything started to change. Like all of you, I have two ears, one nose and a mouth. I feel happy and sad. Then, why is it that you are normal and I am not?” These were the end remarks of 17-year-old   Kamble, winner at a recent elocution competition. Nikhil is one of 750 students with special needs who study at BMC’s special schools.

 
 In a first for the civic special schools, BMC organised an inter-school elocution and story-telling competition for developmentally challenged students. Over 34 from 17 schools participated in the competition put together by  , an NGO.
 
 In a classroom full of their mothers and teachers, the students, with some prompting and encouragement, spoke about various topics — saving the girl child, waste disposal, favourite animal and their dreams. “I love to play carrom and I can aim perfectly. I want to go win tournaments and set up carrom clubs but no one gives me the permission. They all say I won’t be able to,” said Nikhil who studies at a   school.  , who spoke about women empowerment bagged the second prize and   from the   special school won the third spot.
 
 BMC officials said it was a baby step in preparing students for self-advocacy. “When a person’s communication is affected, they cannot voice their opinions and ask for rights... We’ are trying to develop their communication skills and giving them a larger audience was important to boost their confidence,” said Gargi Mhatre, BMC education inspector.
 
 The top three winners of the story telling competition were Sankalp Aagavne, Divya Bhatkar and Ayesha Shaikh. They were felicitated by actor Ratna Pathak Shah.
