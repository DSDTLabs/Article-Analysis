SHIMLA: In  , suitable agro-climatic conditions have resulted into shifting of land use pattern from agriculture to fruit crops in the past few decades. Economic Survey 2016-17, tabled in the state assembly on Thursday, has revealed that 792 hectares were under fruit crops in 1950-51 which increased to 2,26,799 hectares in 2015-16. 

 In 1950-51, total food production of state was 1,200 tons which increased to 9.29 lakh tons in 2015-16. Report says apple is the most important fruit crop of Himachal and the area under it has increased from 400 hectares in 1950-51 to 1,10,679 hectares in 2015-16.
 
 According to the report, this pace of development is further jeopardized due to the erratic apple production, owing to weather vagaries and market fluctuations. It said that the advent of   (WTO), General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and liberalization of the economy is further imposing many challenges on the dominance of apple in fruit industry of state. Report stated that area under temperate fruits other than apple has increased from 900 hectares in 1960-61 to 27,908 hectares in 2015-16. 
 
 As horticulture plays an important role in the livelihood of people, state government has decided to make   (WB) aided Rs 1,134 crore horticulture development project fully operational in 2017-18. Under this project, besides enhancing the productivity of tropical and sub-tropical fruits and vegetables, investment would also be made in improving post harvest infrastructure like automatic packaging, grading lines, compressed atmospheric cold stores and processing plants.
 
 While presenting the budget estimates for 2017-18 in state assembly on Friday, chief minister   proposed to install more weather recording systems across the state so that real time data is captured and insurance benefits flow to deserving farmers.
