DEHRADUN: Following the announcement of the assembly election dates on Wednesday,   has advanced the dates for   of class X and class XII by a month so that the poll dates and exam dates do not clash.
 
  According to board officials, the dates for practical examinations will have to be reshuffled again due to the gap between polling (February 16) and counting of votes (March 11). The final dates for exams are expected to be decided after a meeting next week.
  
  Rakesh Kunwar, director of Uttarakhand Board of School Education, said, "We had decided on these dates before the announcement of the election dates as we expected polling to take place towards February-end. The gap in dates between polling and counting of votes has put us in a dilemma as we can still shuffle the practical exams dates but the dates for written examinations need to have a fixed schedule.”
  
  Elaborating further, Kunwar said, "The written examinations will be held either in the first week of March as usual or after March 13. We will decide on the dates for practical and written examinations at a meeting scheduled to be held on January 10.”
  
  Students appearing for the board exams are in a fix. “As long as we are given enough notice, it is fine. The constant change in dates causes panic among students as they are caught unawares. Though preparations for the exams are underway, it is always better to know the exam timetable at least two months in advance,” said  , a class XII student.
  
  According to officials, there are over 2.5 lakh students who will be appearing for the board examinations across 300 centres in the state. Teachers say that students are being given enough time to prepare for the exams.  , a government school teacher said, "We had told the students in advance that they should expect certain changes in the exam schedule due to the forthcoming assembly elections and should prepare accordingly. We are also giving them full support to ensure good results.”
