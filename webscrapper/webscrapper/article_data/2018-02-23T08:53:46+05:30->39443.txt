CHENNAI: Construction debris, piles of garbage, canals that empty raw sewage into a flood drain that pollutes the Adyar. One would have thought that   had its share of civic problems. 

 But things appear to be out of hand in this neighbourhood just southwest of  : Trash and sewage also fill a now-dry pond in the locality.
 
 There could, however, be hope for the pond, which is near PSBB Millennium School. A group of individuals came together recently to revive the water body. A fortnight later, Environmentalist   (EFI), got residents and volunteers involved and started to restore the pond. People who live around the pond, located near an urbanised pocket, clearly neglected it, the volunteers said. Six drains from streets close by carry sewage to the water body. The volunteers reviving the pond hope to make residents aware of the need to keep it clean - even as they carry out the restoration.
 
 "It took us nearly a month to convince the residents to not let out their sewage into the pond and to subsequently close the outlets,"   Krishnamoorthy of EFI said. It is essential to stop sewage inflow into any water body because it not only causes immediate pollution but, over time, forms natural underwater soak pits that ruin groundwater. "A soak pit can contaminate groundwater in areas within a 1.8-km to 2-km radius," Arun said. 
 
 "We completed clearing the pond of trash in 15 days," EFI coordinator C Vajrivelu said. "Now we hold activities like wall painting events and hold meetings with residents so they keep the pond clean."
