MYSURU:   on Saturday upped the ante at the chief minister hometown, seeking Siddaramaiah’s resignation, accusing him of corrupt practices to remain in power.

 The angry activists said that the chief minister has paid money to Congress high command to ensure that he remains in power.
 
 The activists, led by former ministers S A   and M Shivanna, tried to barge into the CM’s residence, but were detained some 500 metres away. They were taken into preventive custody and released later. This comes a day after the BJP Yova Morcha protested at the residence of district minister H C Mahadevappa.
 
 Seeking to continue the campaign against the Congress government, the workers, led by the former ministers, gathered on New Kantharaja Urs road and tried to march towards the CM’s residence in Sharadadevi Nagar here. They were not allowed to proceed further by the police, who had blocked the roads leading to the residence. The activists later sat on dharna at the site and raised slogans against the chief minister. They also wanted   to drop the controversial steel bridge project.
 
 When some of them tried to break the police cordon and enter the road, there was commotion following a verbal duel between them and police. But the large posse of policemen prevented them from entering the road. Some of them were also bundled into a KSRTC bus. The activists said the chief minister is using police force to suppress their agitation, and said they will not back down until their demands are met. The police later drove them away from the   site. Over 70 leaders were arrested, only to be released later.
