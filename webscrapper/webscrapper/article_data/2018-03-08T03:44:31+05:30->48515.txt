MUMBAI: The   on Wednesday told the state government to consider the issue of   in  , in view of the recent  .

 “Requirement of such (emergency) doors is essential to meet such contingencies,” said a bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla, while hearing a PIL by Shrikant Karve on irregularities in RTOs where fitness certificates are issued/renewed without mandatory tests on such vehicles. 
 
 The government reiterated that new vehicles do not require fitness tests for registration. Its advocate submitted a checklist of 28 tests which it claimed are done on new vehicles on the certificate issued by its manufacturer or body builder. The judges pointed out that the tests are inadequate as per the Motor Vehicle Rules and that the “checklist is completely misleading”. The state’s advocate said the Rule 62 (Validity of fitness certificate) of the Motor Vehicle Rules does not say it is for new vehicles. The judges said while fitness tests are mandatory for renewal the rule does not prohibit it for new vehicles.
 
 The court said the government’s stand that new vehicles do not require fitness constitutes a contempt. “The consistent stand taken by you is that ‘we will go by the certificate issued by the manufacturer or the body builder’,” said Justice Oka. The judges also questioned about absence of escape doors in sleeper buses. “Who will be responsible?” asked Oka.
 
 Karve said government’s claims on checks are sham. He said no checks are done on minibuses which account for large number of accidents. He referred to the December 2017 accident when a 17 seater minibus fell into Panchganga river in Kolhapur killing 12. He said the emergency exit was bolted with 5 seats and due to the impact only two passengers managed to crawl out through a slight opening. Adjourning the hearing, the bench said “the government must consider such incidents”.
