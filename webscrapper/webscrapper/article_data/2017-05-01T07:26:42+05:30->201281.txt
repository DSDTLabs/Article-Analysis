THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Former   president   has issued a legal notice to the government for 'diluting the   order on closure of liquor outlets by denotifying the state highways'. 

 In his notice issued to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, chief secretary Nalini Netto and other department secretaries connected to the implementation of the order through senior counsel in the high court  , it has been said that several liquor outlets have reopened by distorting the actual facts, and if the government fails to rectify the mistake, contempt of court proceedings will be initiated against the respondents.
 
 In the petition, Sudheeran said that altogether 1,956 liquor outlets were closed in the state on the basis of Supreme Court's order. However, several outlets and bar hotels were reopened on the strength of the interim orders issued by the high court. He said that the interim orders were obtained by the interested parties by not placing the correct position regarding the status of the roads before the high court.
 
 "Evidently, the government and the officers under the government did not choose to defend the spirit of the orders of the Supreme Court in this regard. For example, the petitioners have argued before the high court that Kazhakoottam- Karod bypass is the national highway 66 and Keshavapuram- Pattom road has ceased to be a national highway. The government has taken a stand to suit and to agree to such an artificial plea and to sabotage the judgment and the order passed by the Supreme Court," he said.
 
 He claimed that the road map of the state public works cannot be redrawn for nullifying the apex court's judgment and order. He also alleged that there are reports indicating that the excise department and PWD were issuing erroneous opinions regarding the status of the highways.
