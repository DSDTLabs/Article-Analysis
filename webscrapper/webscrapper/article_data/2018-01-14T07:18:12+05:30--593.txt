 Jaipur: Suwawa said that the community members are ready to fight anybody, be it government or censor board or filmmakers. The Jauhar Smriti Sansthan (JSS) – which was leading the bandwagon against the film – has also decided to hold a national seminar on ‘Rani Padmini’ in Chittorgarh on January 21 to bring out a consensus on Padmini’s final narrative.
 
 The JSS has invited 34 historians from across north India, who will discuss and debate to document a life sketch of Padmini. This documentation will be pitched for including it in NCERT and state textbooks.
 
 “The aim of this seminar is to replace the distorted version of our grandmother Rani Padmini by pseudo historians—Malik Muhammad Jayasi and Col James Todd by the authentic version to put an end to all controversies forever,” said JSS spokesperson Lokendra Singh Chundawat.
 
 The shatranis (Rajput women) also threatened to commit ‘jauhar’ (self-immolation) to support their demand of a ban on the film and to protect the honour of Rani Padmini.
