He may be just one film old, but   has already impressed dad   with his professionalism. The young actor skipped Anil’s 60th   celebrations in  , and stayed back in Mumbai to shoot for his second outing with director  . 

 According to a source close to the family, he had informed his father about his decision, which made the latter swell with pride. “Anil would have loved it for Harsh to make it to the bash, but he was happier that his son took his work seriously enough to prioritise it over an intimate family gathering. A set of intense scenes, including some tough action sequences, were being shot around December 24, when the Kapoor clan flew to London. Harsh wanted to focus on his shoot because a break, even for two days, would have meant switching on and off from the complex role that he plays in the vigilante drama,” adds the source.
