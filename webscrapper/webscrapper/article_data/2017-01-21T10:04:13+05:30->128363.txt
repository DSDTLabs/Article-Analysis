NEW DELHI: The two-member panel of senior   advocates Anil Divan and  , empowered to submit the names of the committee of administrators to run   - in the apex court on Friday, had approached Justice (retired)   to become a part of the administrative panel.

 According to sources, both senior lawyers met Mudgal in person with the request but Mudgal turned down the offer, citing his involvement in world football body FIFA. “I did consult Mudgal,” amicus curiae Gopal Subramanium told TOI.
 
 Sources said Mudgal was subsequently approached by former BCCI president   to take up the job, because of his hands-on experience with the Delhi and  . However, the former judge of the   did not change his decision. “There is already too much on his plate and that is why he wasn't willing to be a part of the committee of administrators. His presence would have been the perfect icing on the cake,” a source said.
 
 Whether Mudgal's name appears in the list of nine administrators submitted in a sealed envelope is anyone's guess, but sources said it was unlikely. “Finding time would have been the biggest challenge for him,” said a source.
