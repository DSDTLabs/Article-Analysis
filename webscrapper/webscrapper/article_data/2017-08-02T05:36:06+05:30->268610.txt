MUMBAI: In a first-of-its-kind judgment, the   ( ) has asked for complete closure of two ring wells in Dhobi Talao, which reportedly supplied 5,000 water tankers per month on average between 2006 and 2017 for about Rs 200 crore.

 The well owners did not have permission from the   board to extract water. A recent TERI report on groundwater in the city has already warned about saline water streaming into the wells due to depleting groundwater levels.
 
 In March, the NGT bench led by Justice U D Salvi had restrained three residents of Pandya Mansion in Dhobi Talao from extracting water from two borewells situated at 43, Bomanji Master Lane, 625, Jagannath Shankar Sheth Road, in C Ward without obtaining requisite permissions or NOCs from the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) and the State Ground Water Authority (SGWA).
