PURULIA: Five members of a business family in Purulia’s   entered a  ,   and unable to handle pressure from moneylenders. While two of them have died, the rest are fighting for their lives. Police suspect the family consumed poison.

 On Saturday morning, neighbours of the Nandis called police when none of the family members emerged, with the door locked from the inside. The cops arrived to find five of the family members unconscious. They were rushed to Purulia Sadar Hospital, where Sudipto Nandi (45) and his daughter Rithika (19) were declared dead. Sudipto’s wife Sonali (35), son Abhirup (13) and mother Anjali (75) are critical, and are being treated.
 
 The incident has stunned neighbours. Some neighbours of the Nandis told the police that Sudipto, in particular, was very depressed over the last few days. Cops suspect the family was driven to take their lives after Sudipto’s xerox shop business failed and he was no longer in a position to repay his vast amounts of debt. Reportedly, some moneylenders the Nandis had borrowed from had visited their house on Friday night to ask for the repayment of their loans. 
 
 “We have collected some samples of poison from the house and sent those for forensic tests,” said Purulia SP Joy Biswas.
