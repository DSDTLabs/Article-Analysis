PANAJI: Just as Bharatiya Bhasha Suraksha Manch ( ) and   for   (FORCE) had claimed, the state’s advisory panel on the medium of instruction (MoI) issue is set to seek a second extension of its term from the government. The extension will be sought as the panel is of the opinion it has lost 30 days due to election process in Goa being in progress.

 When the panel was formed in July, it was asked by the state to submit its report on what the medium of instruction should be at the primary school level in Goa. The deadline for the report was set for the first week of November. 
 
 In November, the 17-member committee sought an extension of 90 days, which was granted and the report was to be submitted on February 2. As the date draws closer, member Nagraj Honnekeri told TOI on Tuesday that the panel is likely to seek another extension. Since the extension sought in November, the committee has not covered much ground. The panel has completed its consultation process with parents and stakeholders in seven talukas Pernem, Sattari, Valpoi, Bardez, Tiswadi, Ponda and Quepem. And six South Goa talukas are yet to be covered.
 
 The state on July 15 had constituted a 17-member ‘advisory committee’ under the chairmanship of director of higher education  . Both parties involved in the MoI duelFORCE and BBSM had alleged that the formation of the committee was a ploy for the state to buy time in resolving the MoI issue.
 
 “The final compilation of the report will not take time. The meetings with parents are a long drawn process,” Honnekeri said.
