QUEPEM: An old   leading to the Talvaddo and Poitomado wards of   in   collapsed on Tuesday evening. There were no reports of casualties or vehicular damage.

 The road on which the culvert lies, links the NH 17 from the eastern side at Panzorconem. Sources said the two-metre-long and four-metre-wide culvert had been unstable for some time. A truck driver who had crossed it earlier in the day, told locals that it was not in great condition and was likely to collapse. 
 
 Due to its unstable condition, carnival floats were not allowed to go over it recently.
 
 A councillor of the   (CMC) had requested officials of the public works department (PWD) to inspect the culvert some time ago, a task that didnâ€™t materialise due to waterlogging issues. No repairs could be carried out either due to this reason. Estimates will be prepared shortly to reconstruct the link on the important road.
 
 Another culvert barely 30 metres ahead of the one that collapsed has also been found to be unstable.
