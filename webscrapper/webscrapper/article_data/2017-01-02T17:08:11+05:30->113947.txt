NEW DELHI: Senior   leader   has rejected his expulsion from the party by  .
 
 "Netaji's (Mulayam) step is totally unconstitutional. He has lost the power to expel any one from the party as our national president is now  ," Agarwal said. 
 
 A national convention of the Samajwadi party had earlier anointed Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav the national chief of the SP.
  
 "A father who can remove his son from the party, will obviously not think before expelling leaders like us," Agarwal added, referring to the SP founder's shock decision to expel Akhilesh and Ram Gopal Yadav from the party two days ago. Both men were reinstated the very next day.
  
 Agarwal accused Amar Singh and   of misleading Mulayam and driving him away from his well-wishers.
  
 He also alleged that these leaders were trying to defame Mulayam, and appease the BJP.
  
 "Mulayam should stop praising Modiji. If he starts praising his son, it will be better," Agarwal said.
  
 "It is true that Netaji has made the party. But that does not mean that his will be the last word. There is after all democracy in the party," he said.
