RAIPUR: A group of three technocrats, formerly employees in IT firms in Bangalore, have launched e-services in   in tribal  . They are campaigning for free   in schools and spreading awareness about use of digital tools in daily life. 

 26-year-old Naveen Dewangan worked with Bangalore based Information Technology giants including IBM and TCS for four years before returning to his native place at Kondagoan, a hub for Bastar's handicrafts and bell metal craft. Talking to TOI, Naveen said "Although corporate life gave me an identity, there was no job satisfaction. I decided to channelize my energy towards developing digital literacy in Chhattisgarh."
 
 He added that two of his friends,   and Rahul Patel, hailing from Uttar Pradesh quit their jobs in Bangalore and settled at Kondagoan to empower his vision. He also said that he had managed to convince his friends' parents to let them settle there, who were initially skeptical about the idea, considering the naxal menace in the area.
 
 The three friends then launched a mobile app named 'Mera Shehar', equipped with extensive information on day to day services, relevant contacts of veggie vendors, plumbers, electrician, organic dairy product suppliers, handicraft artisans, famous tourist spots and contacts of taxi-drivers. There are even plans to incorporate features through which public grievances or complaints can be directed to district administration.
 
 The trio are now educating students of government schools on development of websites and software, and how to stay safe from online scams or frauds.
 
 "4000 out of a total population of 30,000 in Kondagoan use mobile phones, out of which 2000 are using our app," said Naveen. He also said they would soon be uploading information of vacancies of government and private jobs available in Kondagoan town.
 
 By next month, they plan to take this venture to  , the divisional headquarters' of Bastar.
