NEW DELHI: Family members of two teenagers found dead in a hotel room at   on Friday are clueless about the cause behind the extreme step. Police will also question the friends of the two teenagers to find out about their relationship. Their mobile phones and social media accounts are being scanned as well.

 The boy’s father who owns a grocery store in   has told the cops that he was unaware his son had a friend by the girl’s name. “He was preparing for the   entrance exam next year and was quite studious. I wonder why he never told us about the girl. We would not have opposed the relation,” he told cops.
 
 The two teenagers studied at the same private school in   but were never seen together during school hours.
 
 “I would have talked to her if I knew about the affair. There is nothing wrong in it,” the girl’s father told the cops, who is a radio operator with the CRPF.
 
 DCP southwest Surender Kumar said that they would separately question the two families. “The two families do not know each other so we would use technical analysis to determine the cause behind the extreme step,” said Kumar.
