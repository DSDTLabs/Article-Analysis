GURUGRAM: The   day of filing   papers for the   elections saw 195 candidates   their papers. In total, 284 candidates will be vying for the 35 seats in the upcoming   that will be held on September 24. Counting of votes and declaration of the results will also take place on the same day.

 Mini Secretariat and Vikas Sadan, where the nomination process was on, witnessed candidates along with their huge number of supporters on Wednesday. While the BJP is contesting on all 35 seats, INLD, which is the only other party contesting on its symbol, has fielded candidates in only 23 out of 35 seats. This means that there are around 226 independents in the fray and on an average there will be around eight candidates from each ward who will contest.
 
 At least four former councillors from BJP who have been denied ticket this time, filed their papers on Wednesday and will contest as independents. 
 
 However, the Congress party has not fielded any official   as it has decided not to contest on its symbol.
 
 The returning officer will scrutinise the nomination papers on Thursday after which the final list of candidates will be announced on Friday. The independent candidates will be allotted symbols on the same day.
