PATNA: With Holi round the corner, city doctors have advised Patnaites to take precautions while playing with  .

 According to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) skin specialist Dr Amar Kant Jha Amar, people should use natural colours on Holi — either home-made or reliable ones available in the market.
 
 “You should avoid coming in direct contact with chemicals present in colours. They can harm internal organs like lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys when they are absorbed into the body,” Dr Amar said and added, “Colours like red and yellow have comparatively less toxic chemicals compared to blue and green that may contain heavy metals like mercury.”
 
 Another PMCH doctor Kusum Gupta explained how harmful colours could cause skin erythema and necrosis. She also advised revellers to apply oil before playing Holi and said, “A dermatologist should immediately be consulted. Mild skin irritation can be treated by taking anti-allergy tablets.”
 
 Eyes should also be protected while playing with colours. “If colour enters your eyes, quickly wash them as chemicals are likely to cause redness and irritation. If the colour contains glass particles, it may lead to corneal abrasion,” ophthalmologist Dr Sunil Kumar Singh told this reporter.
 
 He also urged guardians to supervise small children playing with colours on Holi and stay away from the pointed end of pichkaris.
 
 PMCH’s TB and chest department head Dr Ashok Shankar Singh asked asthma patients and people allergic to dust to remain cautious while playing Holi. “The colour may aggravate the problem. A doctor will have to be consulted in that case,” he said.
