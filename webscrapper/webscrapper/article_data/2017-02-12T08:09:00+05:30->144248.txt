GHAZIABAD: The residents of   housing society, adjoining NH-24 in  , who had threatened to boycott polls, cast their votes on Saturday on the intervention of the district administration. On Friday, TOI had carried a report about the residents’ plan to boycott polls over hooliganism by local youths.

 The tenant has been at large after the incident and has been asked to surrender to police. His family members were kept under watch on Saturday. There are nearly 300 voters in the housing society. Nearly 70% of them had cast their ballots by Saturday afternoon,” Kesarwani told TOI.
