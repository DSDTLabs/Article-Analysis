CHENNAI: A  ,   shot to limelight in July 2009 when   appointed him as secretary of the newly-floated Ilaignar Pasarai and Ilampengal Pasarai of the party to drum up support from youngsters.

 “He was very keen on interacting with youngsters and held meetings in districts bringing to the fold youngsters,” an associate recalled. The 1974-born Venkatesh is the son of Sundaravadanam, Sasikala’s brother.
 
 His supporters say it was following Jayalalithaa’s advice that Venkatesh pursued medicine. He completed his degree at Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, after a year in Annamalai University, Chidambaram.
 
 Along with an associate, Venkatesh runs Liberty High Scans Private Limited in Chennai. The facility was inaugurated by Jayalalithaa in March 2008. His proximity to the power centre had him landing in political “assignments” later. One of his sisters, Anuradha, is married to T T V Dinakaran, while another, Prabhavathi married Dr Shivakumar, one of Jayalalithaa’s physicians.
