Trichy: The city crime branch (CCB) registered two cases against a director of the Trichy study centre of Bharathiar University for cheating Rs 31 lakh from two people on the promise of getting them job at the university and issuing them fake appointment orders, on Sunday. 

 M Ravikumar, 38, director of Bharathiar university district education centre, hailing from Subramaniapuram in the city, and his accomplices Arockiaraj from Viragalur and A Fathima of the same village were booked for cheating and creating fake documents. 
 
 CCB filed the FIR on Sunday following direction from the Trichy judicial magistrate court II based on the complaint from T Rajasekar from Viragalur village. 
 
 According to Rajasekar’s complaint, Ravikumar had offered him a job of programme administrative officer at Bharathiar University for which he had demanded Rs 9 lakh. Lured by the offer, Rajasekar had given him the amount in several instalments between September 22, 2015 and December 29, 2015 through Arockiaraj and Fathima. Ravikumar had also issued an appointment order with the seal of the university. On verification, Rajasekar found out that the order was fake following which he had approached the police. Turned away by the police, he moved the court and got a direction.

Ravikumar had enticed him by offering the post of superintendent officer in Bharathiar university and demanded Rs 22 lakh. Desperate for a job in the university, he paid the amount in several instalments. 
 
 In this case too, Ravikumar issued a fake appointment order. On finding it to be bogus, Chinnadurai filed a case accusing Praba of colluding with Ravikumar in the scam. Since there was no possibilities of recovering the money from Ravikumar, Chinnadurai had moved the court and obtained the direction based on which the case was registered on Sunday.
