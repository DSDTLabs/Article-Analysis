NEW DELHI: Additional fine of Rs 500 levied for each traffic law violation in the capital, as ordered by the   a decade ago, will continue as the   on Friday refused to entertain an appeal against the stiff penalty.

 The HC in its March 26, 2007, order had said, “Wherever any driver of any vehicle, including a two-wheeler, is challaned by the   and/or any other authority, he/she shall be liable to pay cost of Rs 500 for each offence committed by him/her in addition to the composition of the fee (fine) payable under the Motor Vehicles Act.”
 
 Petitioner Harvinder Singh Kalra, through counsel Rani Chhabra, had assailed the HC decision and claimed it was being misused by the traffic police, which were indiscriminately imposing a penalty of Rs 600 (Rs 500 plus the actual fine of Rs 100 prescribed in the law) on citizens for every small violation such as not wearing uniform, no number plate, not using seat-belt, jumping red light, etc.
 
 A bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice N V Ramana refused to get into the nitty-gritty of the issues raised by the petitioner after additional solicitor general Pinky Anand told the court that the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2016 was introduced in Lok Sabha on August 9, 2016. She said it sought to effect comprehensive amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and provide standards for motor vehicles, grant of driving licences and penalties for violation of provisions.
 
 The bench disposed of Kalra’s petition and said the issues raised by the petitioner could be dealt with by Parliament alone.
