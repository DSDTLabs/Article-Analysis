 Sources said that the implementation and need for awareness of the new order will be discussed by senior officials in a board meeting scheduled on Thursday. Cidco officials said that they “will check the status of residents as first or second buyers, authenticate the documents and ensure all dues have been paid off”.
 
 The order will benefit mostly JN-1, JN-2 and some JN-3 type buildings as they will now get 2.5 FSI for redevelopment.   corporator, Kishore Patkar, who was pursuing the case, said, “Now the societies act will be implemented for such housing associations which now requires 70:30 consent for redevelopment.”
 
 Patkar added that 135 buildings in sectors 9 and 10, Vashi, which were identified as dangerous, can now be redeveloped.
