Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has abandoned a newly constructed   at Bajaj Nagar. Yet to be inaugurated, the paint on it is already fading.

 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had sanctioned special funds for developmental works in his South-West constituency two years ago. Ruling party leader Sandip Joshi then developed an amphitheatre adjacent to the basketball court at Bajaj Nagar. 
 
 The NMC’s district planning committee (DPC) cell constructed the structure at the cost of around Rs14 lakh a year ago.
 
 On Tuesday, when TOI visited the garden, stray dogs had overrun the amphitheatre. Grass had grown on paver blocks laid in front of the stage. Apart from the fading painting, there were small damages to the concrete structure.
 
 The DPC Cell did not construct a seating arena at the amphitheatre as it was not in the scope of works. The open space in front of the stage, where chairs are supposed to be placed for viewers, is in poor condition.
 
 After the one at the Traffic Park, the amphitheatre is probably only the second one built by the NMC.
 
 An official from DPC Cell said the Laxmi Nagar Zone should have planned the operation and maintenance of the amphitheatre. “Our responsibility ended with its construction. The zone office has to decide whether it is going to maintain it or hand it over to any citizens’ forum,” he said.
 
 A Laxmi Nagar zone official said he has no intimation from the DPC Cell if work has been completed. “I will look into the issue soon,” he said.
 
 Joshi said he would plan the project’s operation and maintenance soon. “Verma Layout residents had demanded an amphitheatre. The land on which the project was proposed is in dispute. Therefore, NMC shifted it to Bajaj Nagar,” he said.
