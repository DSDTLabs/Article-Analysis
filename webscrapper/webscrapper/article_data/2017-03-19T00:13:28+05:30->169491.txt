Pune:   founder N R Narayana   on Saturday said deep-rooted corruption was one of the biggest hurdles on the country’s road to prosperity.

 Murthy was at the   to award degrees to students in a convocation ceremony, where he also gave the Kale memorial lecture.
 
 “If we are able to reduce corruption in the country by 50%, the GDP is bound to grow by more than 1.5 times,” said Murthy, who expressed concerns over the state of affairs in the country — battling shortage of good healthcare, sanitation, drinking water, and prevalent evils like child labour.
 
 Murthy said corruption brings to the fore inequality in the society and urged every politician to fight corrupt practices for a better future. “Corruption reduces growth, debilitates the economy, taking it into a negative spiral,” Murthy said. 
 
 “The four factors one must stress on for a better economy are: reduce corruption, discipline in every sector, good work ethics and citizens’ faith in government institutions,’’ Murthy said.
 
 Murthy also said it was time for India to become an open-minded society, and improve the number and quality of jobs for youngsters. “The culture of the society should be such that we can open up and create more opportunities for youngsters, and help them become good entrepreneurs,” Murthy said.
