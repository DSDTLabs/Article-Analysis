Bengaluru: The   board has announced that it will return one-third of cash or up to Rs 13,000 crore ($2 billion) to shareholders during the 2017-18 financial year by way of dividend or a share buyback. Infosys has $5.9 billion of cash sitting on its books. 

 Earlier this year, Cognizant, TCS and HCL technologies all announced stock buybacks. IT services companies have accumulated large amounts of cash, but given the slowdown in the sector and their current business models, they don’t have any particular reason to hold on to such levels of cash. Hence the move to return a portion of it to shareholders.
 Infosys has also decided that effective 2017-18, the company will pay out up to 70% of the free cash flow. The current policy is to pay dividends of up to 50% of post-tax profits in a given financial year. 
 
  equity analysts Parag Gupta and Gaurav Rateria in a note said, assuming a conversion of 70%-90% of net income into free cash flow (based on historical trends), the revised policy implies a regular payout of 50%-63% (vs current policy of payout of up to 50% of net income).”
