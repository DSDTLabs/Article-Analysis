HYDERABAD: In a first such order, nine persons were imprisoned for three days by a local magistrate for encroaching pavements. They were also asked to pay a penalty of `2,500 each.

 As part of the   initiative, Hyderabad police and   (GHMC) officials started removing encroachments on footpaths. The drive was taken up in Mahankali, Gopalpuram, SR Nagar, Panjagutta, Abids, Narayanguda, Chikadpally , Banjara Hills and   police station limits in the city.
 
 “We booked 30 cases and the accused were produced before the magistrate. For the first time in the history of the Hyderabad traffic police, 21 persons were convicted and fines ranging from `2,000 to `3,000 were imposed on them. Nine persons were convicted and imprisoned at   jail for either two or three days along with a fine of `2,500,“ deputy commissioner of police (Traffic) LS Chowhan said.
 
 “This drive will continue till all footpaths are cleared of encroachments and punishment for repeat offenders will be more stringent,'' he said. GHMC commissioner B Janardhan Reddy said, “We are taking strict action against encroachers as per the Act. We will continue this process till all the encroachments are removed from the city's footpaths."
