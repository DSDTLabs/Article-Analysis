 Coogler found that Black Panther's appearance in 'Captain America: Civil War' was "a great jumping off point". "I would say that Cap's universe and Black Panther's universe are closely related. Some writers in the past hinted at that more than others," Coogler said in a statement. 
 
 "But you have the vibranium connection and you have the super soldier connection. Captain America tends to be a character who's easily defined. For Cap it is black and white; there's right and there's wrong. He's a soldier. Whereas Black Panther exists in the gray area. In addition to being a soldier, he has a more important job, which is a politician. He's this monarch whose world is extremely complicated.
