. Excerpts.

 
 I have explained my stand for quitting Congress and joining BJP. I have no political ambitions. I don't think I'll make efforts to enter Rajya Sabha from outside  . I'm here to support Modi's vision to build a strong India.
 
 
 No. A referendum on the Congress government could be a wrong assumption. We should restrict the results to the respective segments. There are local issues on which people will make up their mind and vote. That's what my political sense says.
 
 
 It's one of the worst governments I've seen in my 55 years of political career. I've seen eminent political leaders before Independence and   right from K C Reddy . But this gover nment lacks vision about the state's growth.There is no dream. Governance is no 11am to 7pm job. It's a 24x7 job. I would like to draw attention towards PM Modi's style of functioning and gov ernance. Even when he was fasting for nine days, he was working in the South Block till midnight. If we had such a leader, the state would have been somewhere else. What we see is total stagnation. The CM's governance is based on some calculations, which is not the way to put Karnataka on the development track.
 
 
 Where is Congress at the national level, we have to look for it. If you can help find it, please do.
 
 
 Some 18 months ago I addressed a Congress meeting.I referred to Sanskrit aphorism 'Aham Brahmasmi' and expressed my feelings (about Siddaramaiah's governance).When farmers committed suicide in Mandya, the then district minister (M H Ambarish) didn't reach out to them.I don't know whether the CM is aware about it. I went to meet them with some of my friends and consoled the family members of the dead.It was after 3-4 days that the ministers started visiting the area.
