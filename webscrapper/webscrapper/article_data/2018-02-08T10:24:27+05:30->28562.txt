NEW DELHI: Tata’s once ambitious budget car   cannot continue beyond next year in its present form and may need fresh investments to survive, or face the axe.

 
  MD   told TOI that new safety regulations mean that the Nano may require an overhaul.
 
 Asked whether this would mean a phase-out of the model, he said, “It could be one of the calls. We are evaluating. No decision has been made as yet. We would need to make quite significant investments for the upgrade of the Nano to meet changes in the regulatory environment. This is one of the calls that we need to take as we are currently reviewing our product portfolio.”
 
 Butschek said the company, which is in the process of launching new cars and SUVs, is also carrying out a “holistic review” of its existing portfolio. This is being done in view of the “stringent safety norms” that are being mandated for all the cars that will be sold in India. “Changes in the safety regulations will lead to a question mark on a series of products,” he said. The Nano, which was launched by the company with much fanfare in 2009, has been a laggard for Tata Motors, despite many upgrades. A brainchild of former Tata group chief  , the car has failed to enthuse buyers.
 
 At the Expo, the company unveiled two concept vehicles — a luxury SUV and a premium hatchback — besides showcasing six electric vehicles in the mass and personal mobility segments.
