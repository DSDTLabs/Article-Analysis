VISAKHAPATNAM: The district education department authorities are chalking out a full-fledged summer coaching plan that will be executed from 2018, said district educational officer ( ) G  , adding that the plan will include over 3.5 lakh students studying in 550 schools in the district.

 “It is a huge task and we have given full responsibility to the headmasters, high school teachers, and primary school teachers to draw a full curriculum for the summer coaching sessions in accordance with the HRD minister’s instructions. Commissioner of school education K   has issued orders to that effect,” Nagamani told TOI.
 
 Summer coaching camps are already in progress in private and aided schools since May 6 this year. However, government schools could not implement the plans and conduct the camps properly. 
 
 Regarding the performance of government school students in mathematics, sciences and English, the DEO said, “We are piecing the data together as it will give us a fair idea on how well the students fare. However, the data has to be sub-divided further as we need to make comparative study of performance. It will be completed after the 2017-18 academic year begins.”
