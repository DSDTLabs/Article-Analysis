AHMEDABAD: In the last two months, at least three elected representatives of   (AMC) have pointed out a major flaw in door-to-door garbage collection. On Tuesday, opposition leader Dinesh Sharma said he intercepted a garbage vehicle (Chhota Hathi) in Thakkarbappanagar running on Route 11, which was filled with flower waste that came from a nearby school.

 The waste consisted of flower decorations and kitchen waste from a function at the school. “I believe that instead of going door to door they go to specific places and collect waste in bulk and collect money from AMC. Sharma questioned the efficiency of the real-time GPS monitoring system of the AMC, which was to ensure transparency in garbage collection. A few weeks ago, standing committee chairman  , intercepted a vehicle collecting sugar biscuits (Patasha) from a food processing unit in Madhupura area instead of going door to door. Patel had taken the issue up with the last standing committee. 
 
 “Two months ago, the municipal commissioner pulled up zonal officers for being slack in monitoring garbage collection in North, East and West Zones. We are trying to bring more accountability to the system,” says a senior official from the North Zone. He added, “We have taken serious note of the issue. We are also introducing QR code system at every collection point. Staff will have to scan the QR codes with their mobiles, and only then will payments be made to them,” the AMC official said. 
 
 The third such instance was   councillor Jatin Patel, who has been lodging complaints with AMC’s central office that nearly 50 societies in Ghatlodiya had complained that door to door garbage collection has been irregular in the area.
