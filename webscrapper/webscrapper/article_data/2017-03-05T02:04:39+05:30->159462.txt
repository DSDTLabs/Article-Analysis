VARANASI: Just as he did when he came to file his nomination for the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, PM   began his Varanasi roadshow on Saturday morning from the gates of Banaras Hindu University after garlanding the statue of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya.

 Greeted by BJP supporters wearing saffron caps and bandanas, his cavalcade began as the PM, accompanied by senior BJP members and ministers, was led by BJP functionaries on motorcycles.
 
 Standing through the skylight of his car,   covered the distance of around 4.5km from BHU Crossing to Kashi Vishwanath Temple.
 
 The crowd of supporters grew bigger as the roadshow moved from Lanka, Assi Road to Assi Sangam, Sahadarveer Pul, Madanpura, before reaching Godaulia Crossing near the Lord Shiva temple, passing through narrow lanes.
 
 As the roadshow moved through Madanpura, a predominantly Muslim-dominated area, many citizens in skullcaps were seen taking pictures on their mobiles or showering flower petals on the PM.
 
 The roadshow finally reached Kashi Vishwanath at 1.15pm and the PM went inside to offer prayers before moving on to do the same at Kal Bhairav temple in City Kotwali area, in his first visit since he became PM in 2014.
 
 Modi’s roadshow angered Congress, which urged the EC to book him and other BJP members for alleged violation of the model code for allegedly holding the procession without prior permission. In response, UP BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya said the event was not a roadshow but a ‘jandarshan’. Maurya said Modi was in the city to offer prayers at Kashi Vishwanath and it was the love of people which resulted in him receiving a grand welcome.
