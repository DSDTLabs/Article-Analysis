HYDERABAD: A day after the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) accepted defeat in the Uttar Pradesh elections,   general secretary Digvijaya Singh launched a salvo against party president  , accusing him of helping the  . 

 Taking to micro-blogging website Twitter, the senior Congress leader tweeted, "They didn't win but did help the BJP to win."
 
 The one time allies Congress and MIM have locked horns since 2012, after Owaisi decided to withdraw support to the grand old party, which suffered a defeat in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. 
 
 It was on Saturday that Owaisi, while speaking to the media, refused to comment on a question regarding Digvijay Singh. "Just ignore him. He is a joker. Don't take his name, at least not here (in party headquarters in Darussalaam)," Owaisi had retorted in a jocular manner. 
 
 Allegations were levelled against the Owaisi brothers that they are helping the BJP after the duo began to look beyond their bastion of Hyderabad and fielded party candidates in other states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Bihar and now Uttar Pradesh. The Hyderabad parliamentarian has slammed the allegation even as he asserted that in no way is the MIM supporting the saffron party and that the Muslim vote bank is a myth.
 
 In the recent past, the senior Congress leader drew flak from Muslim leaders after he compared madrassas with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh run   schools.
