HYDERABAD: Telangana and   have overcome the perennial problem of power shortage after they shifted to LED lamps on a massive scale. And the man, who gave the world the highly power-saving LED lamps, is currently in Hyderabad delivering lectures to students and scientists. His visit, however, remains unsung with no official honour.

 Meet Prof  , the winner of   in 2014 in physics for inventing efficient blue lightemitting diodes (LED). His invention has resulted in bright and energy-saving white light sources. In fact, LED lamps are the sources of efficient lighting for the 21st century.
 
 On Thursday, Prof Amano visited IICT in connection with the platinum jubilee year celebrations. He delivered an inspiring lecture on the new lighting sources and interacted with scientists and students.
 
 Appreciating the important research work being carried out at CSIR-IICT, Prof Amano proposed that IICT and his research group at Akasaki Research Centre, Nagoya University, Japan, should join hands for further developments of advanced semiconducting materials. IICT director S   has readily agreed.
 
 “Creation of white light involves a combination of light spectrum or red, green and blue lights. However, Prof Amano has shown the world for the first time that a low power blue light alone is adequate for generating the complex white light,” said an IICT statement here.
 
 Prof Amano later demonstrated on the stage of CSIR-IICT auditorium how he had made the invention that had changed the very concept of lighting.
 
 “His spectacular contribution has resulted in transformative electronics for the development of sustainable smart society,” said Dr Chandrasekhar.
