KORAPUT: To encourage motorists to wear helmets,   police on Saturday distributed roses and chocolates among motorists wearing the protective gear as a part of the 29th National Road Safety Week. Policemen were deployed at different points along NH-26 passing through the town to gift the roses. 

 "We have been booking cases for helmetless riding for the last few weeks and in the last one month we have collected around Rs 3.50 lakh as fine. But there is no change in the attitude of motorists. So we thought of encouraging helmet users so that it will prompt others to use it," said additional superintendent of police (Koraput) V R Rao.
 
 Police said the drive launched in Koraput will continue for one week and will be held across all urban areas. Also, police took out a motorcycle rally, especially for women two-wheeler drivers, at   to create awareness among the masses for use of helmets among motorists. 
 
 Apart from urging motorists to wear helmet, police through the rally tried to dissuade people from drunk driving, using cellphones while driving and speeding. Trainee IPS officer   posted as inspector-in-charge of Borigumma police stations spoke about the benefits of wearing helmet and how it could reduce the impact of damage by almost 72%. 
 
 "Motorists should wear helmets to protect themselves from accidents and not only out of fear of police. It is everyone's duty to obey traffic rule and by obeying it accidents can be avoided to a great extent," said Nath.
