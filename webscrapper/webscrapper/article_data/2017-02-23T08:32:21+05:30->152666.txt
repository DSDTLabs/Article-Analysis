KOZHIKODE: A divorcee’s attempt to clear the hurdles in the way of her second marriage proved to be fatal for her. 

 The woman, Shamina (35) hailing from Puthiyakadavu here, had approached Najma, a   practitioner, at her residence in Kuttiady on Saturday afternoon, police said. 
 
 While the black magic was being performed, Shamina’s dress caught fire from a petrol-filled earthen pot which was lit up as part of the proceedings. 
 
 Though Najma tried to douse the fire by pouring water brought from the bathroom, Shamina had suffered 50%   by the time the fire could be put out. She also tried to remove Shamina’s dress.
 
 The relatives who had accompanied Shamina immediately rushed her to the Nadapuram taluk hospital and later to a private hospital in the city. However, she breathed her last on Wednesday.
 
 Najma has been arrested on charges of attempt to murder and destruction of evidence.
 
 Meanwhile, various Muslim organisations have expressed concern over the increasing incidents of gullible people falling prey to fake spiritual centres. Ithihadu Subbanil Mujahideen (ISM), the feeder organisation of the   (KNM), has asked the government to take stern action against the guilty.
 
 “We had submitted several memorandum to the government to bring in a legislation to put an end to this evil practice,” said A I Abdul Majeed Swalahi, the state president of the ISM. “The tortures in the name of Jinn treatment and black magic are an insult to the Kerala society,” he said.
 
 Wisdom Global Islamic Mission, another Salafi group, has also come out against fake spiritual centres that are exploiting the people. Its members organised a meeting to protest against the incident, at Nadapuram on Wednesday. They said that they are planning to convene a meeting of Muslim women to create an awareness against such superstitions.
