NAGPUR: It is believed that global ban on   emission has started to show results as the   hole formed in   has been recovering. However, meteorologists fear that less attention is being paid to the alternatives used in place of CFC, especially hydroflourocarbon (HFC) where the results can be equally devastating. 

 The revelation came out during a talk on Ozone Day organized by the Nagpur chapter of Indian Meteorological Society. Deputy director general of meteorology   and regional meteorological centre director AD Tathe, were present. The programme was organized at the weather department recently. 
 
 In his speech, city meteorologist Avinash Tarodekar, who recently underwent training in environment monitoring the at weather department in New Delhi, said, “Though we have instruments to record the thickness and volume of ozone layer from the surface of Earth, it was in 1980 that the ozone hole in Antarctic was first recorded through a satellite data.”
 
 “The Montreal Protocol led to the global phase out of most substances that deplete the ozone layer. It is time we start to recover. It is also true that total recovery of ozone will be a century long process since the effect of CFC on ozone layer stays for 100 years,” said Tarodekar.
 
 He said, “We might face further delay since other gases, including the alternatives used in place of CFC, may have same effect and may also live long.” The ozone depletion in Antarctic had its effect on the entire Earth with increase in global warming, but India is far safe compared to other parts of the world which have witnessed carious skin diseases and illness in citizens.
