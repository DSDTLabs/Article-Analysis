Panaji: Following the withdrawal of Society for Industrial and Technical Education of Goa (SITEG), the cabinet on Wednesday approved the selection of industry powerhouse   Agro Chemicals Limited as the industry partner for the Vasco Industrial Training Institute (ITI) under a public-private partnership mode.

 The institute will get a facelift through an interest-free loan of Rs 2.5 crore under the Union government’s scheme for modernisation of 1,389 ITIs across India.
 
 “There will be a moratorium of 10 years from the year in which the loan is released. After 10 years, the loan will be payable in equal annual installments over a period of 20 years,” secretary for skill development and entrepreneurship, G Jaiswal, said in the cabinet note.
 
 According to the agreement, as industry partner, Zuari Agro Chemcals Ltd will provide production technology, technical expertise and employment potential. They will also provide internship for students and absorb them upon completion of their courses.
 
 “Zuari Agro has assured placement of passed out trainees of trade attendant operators for chemical plant for an initial period of three years,” Jaiswal said.
 
 A tripartite agreement has already been signed between the state government, Union government and the institute’s managing committee. The ITI’s administrative control with respect to regulating admissions, vacancies and the salaries of staff, will remain with the state government.
 
 The cabinet also gave its nod for the appointment of 21 vocational instructors on contractual basis for a year at different government ITIs.
 
 “Due to the overwhelming response shown by the youth for acquiring admission in the ITIs in Goa, additional trades have been introduced to accommodate more than 700 new trainees. Accordingly, services of 21 additional vocational instructors have to be engaged,” a cabinet note said.
