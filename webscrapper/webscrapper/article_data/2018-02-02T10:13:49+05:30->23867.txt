CHANDIGARH: The budget might have disheartened the salaried group, but Arun Jaitly’s election budget has apparently brought some smile on the faces of industrialists and entrepreneurs of the state.

 Haryana has a total 80,000 medium small and micro entrepreneurs. “This year Rs 3,974 crore have been allocated to   Sector, not just this for the organizations having turnover up to 250 crore, the corporate tax has been reduced to 25% which would cover 99% of the MSMEs in the state,” said Haryana industries minister  .
 
 “I believe the textile sector allocation of Rs 7,148 crore will have huge impact and areas like Panipat will stand to be benefitted,” he added.
 
 President of   (HCCI)   termed the budget as a “stable” one.
 
 “Ours is an agriculture driven economy. An impressive allocation to this sector means more production and more inflow of money. This is coupled with the reduced tax rates. This will certainly benefit entrepreneurs across the state who were yet to come to the terms of losses suffered by them during and after the demonetization and slow down. This was a stable budget for us all,” said Vishnu.
 
 “This kind of budget was the need of the hour. We are hopeful for more to come from Haryana now, he added.
