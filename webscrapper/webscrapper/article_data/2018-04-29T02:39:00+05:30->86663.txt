Vijayawada: As the state government could not take a decision on the increase of profit margin, the   between the government and the wine dealers continues even after four days. The wine dealers had stopped buying stocks from the   depots in protest. Also they staged dharnas in front of government liquor depots across the state. Supplies are likely to take a hit across the state if the stalemate continues for another three days as stocks are nearing completion at many wine shops.

 The chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday said that they have been examining the issue and will take decision soon. He also clarified that the government will not budge to any threats. The wine dealers have been claiming that with the present profit margin of 10%, they could not even get operating costs. The dealers are demanding to increase the margin to 16%, the officials in the excise department have been arguing that the wine dealers have earned Rs 236 crore profits since the new policy has come into force.
 
 The wine dealersâ€™ association state president Rayala Subbarao told that the wine dealers have lost Rs 432 core non-refundable license fee, which the government is not considering as investment cost. As the licenses were allotted through lottery system, wine dealers with an aim to get the license participated with 10 to 15 applications to increase their chances of getting licenses. The application fee is non-refundable and the government earned Rs 432 crore on only application fee. Subbarao also told that they have been paying 1% income tax that amounts to Rs 150 crore which no wine dealer has claimed back ever. When calculated the investment cost by taking only one application into account the excise officials have concluded that the wine dealers have made Rs 236 crore profits. According to a wine dealer, the dealers were not happy with the excise minister K S Jawahar for not taking up the issue to find a solution.
