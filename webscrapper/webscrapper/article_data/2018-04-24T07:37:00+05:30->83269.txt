Bathinda: Freedom fighter Bhagat Singh’s nephew Jagmohan   has opposed the move to allegedly dilute the provisions of SC/ST (Presention of Atrocities) Act, claiming that the country could not achieve “Swaraj” without fighting for the rights of the poor and Dalits.

 Speaking at a seminar, Dalits in India, organised by the   (AFDR) here on Sunday, Jagmohan said many people claimed that reservation for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe comunities had an adverse effect on the quality of education and employees. “But they must keep in mind that quality is dented by those who pay for coaching classes because of their immense wealth. The Act tries to negate this injustice,” he said. 
 
 Singh said the architect of India’s Constitution, B R Ambedkar, had fought for the right of Dalits to draw water from wells in village. “Still, Dalits are deprived of such rights to this date in many places. Now the forces that be want to soften the SC/ST Act; this is not right,” he said.
