PANAJI: The decision of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), to allow shacks on Goan beaches to function all through the year, has not gone down well with scientists who say that this will destroy the ecologically sensitive sand   which are the first line of defence against sand erosion.

  Goa biodiversity board member and former   ( ) scientist, A  , expressed shock over the MoEFCC’s decision. “I have been talking about how there cannot be any compromise when it comes to the sand dunes,” he said. He also said that if shacks are allowed to function through the year, it will destroy this natural first line of defence, the repercussion of which though difficult to pridict, could be drastic.
 
 Mascarenhas said during every monsoon, the beach keeps getting eroded, and when the rain subsides, beach formations take place. “If shacks are allowed on beaches during the monson, they are bound to get smashed and there is possibility of further erosion of the beach,” he said.
 
 “If this decision comes into play, a shack, which by definition is a temporary structure, would eventually become a quasi-permanent restaurant,” he said.
 
 In the past, licences issued for the erection of beach shacks were valid for just one year, but the government changed its beach shack policy in 2012 increasing the validity period to three years. Also, shack operators had to dismantle their structures at the end of every tourist season.
 
 On April 25 last year, the MoEFCC issued a draft notification for objections and suggestions. In a draft amendment to the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011, the MoEFCC proposes to facilitate beach shack allottees to maintain their structures for the period between June and August.
 
  Goa   (GCZMA) members had strongly objected to this draft notification.
