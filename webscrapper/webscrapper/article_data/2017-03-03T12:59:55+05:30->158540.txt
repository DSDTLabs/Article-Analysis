MUMBAI: International and national crusaders, who have been working towards the control and eradication of  , have condemned the  's (WHO) decision to not include   in the list of deadly bacteria that needs urgent attention from developers of antibiotics. The WHO on Monday had published its first ever list of antibiotic-resistant 'priority-pathogens' but excluded TB from the catalogue of 12 bacteria families that pose the biggest threat to global health.

  The Union, which is one of the leading scientific non-profit organisations fighting against TB, called the exclusion "unacceptable". It contended that the disease kills more people that any other pathogen. Quoting WHO figures, the Union stated that in 2015 alone, 1.8 million people died of the disease, including 210,000 children. An estimated 580,000 people were reported to have multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively   (XDR-TB). “It is outrageous to sideline TB from global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) efforts. Among the group of antimicrobial-resistant diseases, drug-resistant TB is a leading cause of sickness and death. Failing to include TB on its list was a dramatic departure from the data, and it undermines efforts to find the new and better treatments that patients desperately need. This is particularly critical for those countries where drug-resistant TB is epidemic,” said José  , executive director, the Union.
 
  The WHO, while releasing the list, had said that it was intended to spur governments to put in place policies that incentivize basic science and advanced R&D by both publicly funded agencies and the private sector investing in new antibiotic discovery.
  The WHO's justification of not including TB in the list was that the world is adequately aware of the threat it poses and steps are already being taken. It said "TB– whose resistance to traditional treatment has been growing in recent years – was not included in the list because it is targeted by other, dedicated programmes."
