BELAGAVI: To eliminate human error in recording swimmers’ timings, the   has started using   at   in  . 

 These automatic, sensitive-to-the-touch swimming devices record time within hundredths of a second and avoid confusions and disputes in judgments. 
 
 Swimming is a sport wherein finishes are extremely close. Even a micro second matters and recording the swimmers’ exact finishing times becomes a huge challenge. Disputes over judgments are common. Touchpads were used at the 29th South Zone Swimming Championship held at the Suvarna JNMC swimming pool recently. There are eight lanes in this 50-m length swimming pool. The length of swimming, duration and position of swimmers flashes on the digital board immediately after swimmers reach the target and touch the electronic pads.
 
 “Use of touchpads which have automatic electronic timing devices gives most accurate results. It also reduces the number of officials on the swim decks during swimming events,” said Umesh Kalghatagi, a senior swimming coach.
 
 Nilkanthrao Jagadale, president of  , said the technology is very expensive. “It needs a special operational team. Touch boards were not used even at state-level competitions due to the cost factor. We are planning to make them available at the state-level swimming events in the coming days,” he said. 
 
 Krizana Irani, a swimmer from Belagavi, said, “Many a times, I thought I won but the results showed otherwise. It was very disappointing. The touchpads must be used during all events for accurate judgments.”
