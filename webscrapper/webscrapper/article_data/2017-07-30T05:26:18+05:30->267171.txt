NEW DELHI:   minister Arun   said on Saturday the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ( ) framework and the governmentâ€™s emphasis on resolution represent a unique opportunity for Asset Reconstruction   (ARCs) and private equity (PE) firms.

 The FM, who met leading ARCs and PE firms focussed on stressed assets, said that accounts classified as impaired or stressed still had inherent value.
 
 These were essentially productive assets which, if turned around, would not only create additional   but also contribute to national output. 
 
 For this to happen, timely interventions, transparent price discovery and right management were required.
 
 Jaitley highlighted the legislative and regulatory changes made over the last 18 months which had created an enabling and supportive operational environment for ARCs and takeover of stressed assets by PE firms, special situation funds.
