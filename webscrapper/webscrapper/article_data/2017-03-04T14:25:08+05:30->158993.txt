PANAJI: The Union road transport ministry’s decision of granting in-principle approval for 21 new national highways in Goa can pose possible threats to wildlife, said experts. 

 The land animals and mammals who move in search of prey may get affected. Reptiles and some primate species who cannot jump through trees may be victims of road kill while crossing the wide roads to reach the other side of the forest.
 
 “Any bifurcation of a forest into two will have a negative impact on the life of the forest,” said   of Centre for Environment Education (CEE).
 
 The wide roads may lead to confinement of wildlife to a particular area.
 
 “By building wide roads, they will be destroying the forest’s corridor and disturbing the animals’ movement. Besides, when the traffic increases, there is going to be noise pollution and tree-felling which the wildlife is not accustomed to,” he said.
 
 According to environmentalist  , the forest areas adjoining the roads will also face a lot of damage. “Trees near existing roads may be cut for road widening. When this reduction in landmass takes place, biodiversity suffers,” he said.
 
 A spokesperson from the Goa forest department said, “Many of the proposed highways will be passing through protected areas (PAs) of forests. The corridors that the wildlife uses as passages will get broken down and their habitat will also get fragmented. We will have to look at these areas which will be lost to the highways and accordingly offer our suggestions to the ministry of road transport and highways.”
 
 Distressed with the road transport ministry, wildlife rescuer   has decided to write to them to reverse their decision.
 
 “There is already rampant deforestation in Goa. Now the central ministry is encroaching upon protected forest areas. We animal lovers and environmentalists and animal lovers will come together to identify the areas marked by the ministry and then write to them to reverse this decision.” he said.
