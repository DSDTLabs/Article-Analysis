GURUGRAM: For almost a week, residents in a large portion of   1 have been trying to stay indoors after the sundown, fearing snatchers and other rough elements on dark streets.

 They said the lanes in   were being plunged into darkness after sunset every day, since the discom snapped power supply to the   last Thursday over pending electricity bills. Residents blamed ProFac, the agency responsible for maintenance of civic amenities, for non-payment of bills. But it rubbished the allegation.
 
 A spokesperson for ProFac claimed residents were not paying maintenance charges and nearly Rs 17 crore was outstanding for months. “We have been unable to pay our staff members. We asked residents to clear the dues and they are saying they will pay after elections. How will we manage all this? We have records of all the residents who are not paying their maintenance charges,” the spokesperson added.
 
 The residents denied the charge and said they owed hardly Rs 4-5 lakh to the agency and added that the discom disconnected the supply because ProFac did not pay the bills in time. “We had had several run-ins with the maintenance agency and discom officials on the issue in the past. Disconnecting street lights pose security threats,” said  , a resident.
 
 “We are scared to move out at night. The discom should have waited for a few more days before disconnecting the supply,” said  , another resident.
 
 The residents claimed there had been incidents of snatching in the area at night, and urged discom to restore supply considering the people’s safety.
 
 DHBVN officials said the street lights were connected to their automated R-APDRP (The Restructured Accelerated Power Development Programme) that snapped the supply due to non-payment of bills. Asked if discom would reconsider the matter,  , superintendent engineer, new Gurugram, said, “I cannot say yet. I need to see to the issue before I can say anything on it.”
