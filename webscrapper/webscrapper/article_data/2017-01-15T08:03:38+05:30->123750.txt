KANPUR: A large nesting colony of painted stork ( ) was sighted in   on National Highway-2 in   district. The colony was spotted by the local people who informed the forest department.

 “A huge flock of painted storks was spotted on banyan and sheesham trees close to a water body (wetland) by the roadside near the village. The colony has nearly 200 painted storks, besides 500 to 600 young ones, which are 15 to 20 days old,“ divisional forest officer, Kanpur Dehat, Rajiv Mishra said.The colourful birds were seen perched atop the trees in tightly knitted nests. Most nests are large ones to save the eggs and chicks from predators.
 
 Painted stork is an Indian migratory bird placed in the nearly threatened red list category by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN) due to rapid decline in its population owing to hunting, habitat destruction, agricultural practices and pollution.
 
 There are nearly half-a dozen banyan and sheesham trees in the area that house 35 to 40 nests each.The breeding season of painted storks begins with the onset of winters. Mishra told TOI that the department is implementing a conservation programme to protect these birds. Local nature enthusiasts urged the government agencies to review the status of existing population of birds and take appropriate steps to conserve the existing nesting colony by creating public awareness in nearby villages.
 
 “These birds are known to make nesting colonies close to wetlands or water bodies ,“ a bird lover   said.
