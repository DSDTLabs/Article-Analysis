NEW DELHI: A   was   on Thursday into the death of city   who had a fatal fall on Wednesday from the sixth floor of   at CGO complex, south Delhi. 

 DRI officials had told the police on Wednesday evening that Gaurav and his father Ashok Gupta had reached the DRI office around 10.30am. But Gupta senior had left the building after some time. Before leaving, though, he had asked the guards present at the building if he could enter with the same pass again.
 
 Senior police officers said they were probing the allegations levelled by the Gupta family, such as Ashok Gupta being made to hear an audio clip purportedly belonging to his son in which he was calling for help. Police said they were trying to find out if the allegation was true or DRI had played a false tape. They are also probing how Gaurav climbed up the window that’s over five feet above ground. Sources also said that the police were investigating why nobody tried to stop Gupta when he was climbing up the window.
 
 Family members also alleged that they were asked for a huge sum of money to settle the matter through a broker. “The family members will be recording their statements and we will be probing all allegations,” said a senior police officer.
 
 A probe would also look into the allegations that Gupta was detained and brought to the CGO complex even though DRI has claimed that he hadn’t be summoned or questioned. 
 
 The Guptas, meanwhile, approached Shalimar Bagh police station and complained that DRI officials even took away the savings of Stuti Gupta, Gaurav’s wife. The Guptas also complained that Gaurav was beaten up by the DRI officials at his house during the raid. CCTV footage from the house would also be scanned.
 
 The autopsy would be conducted by a medical board on Friday on the orders of the Delhi high court.
