CHENNAI:   MLAs, barring those belonging to the  ,  , and   and   independent MLA  , will get a hefty salary of Rs 5.05 lakh in their bank accounts in the next few days. Being the last month of the financial year, the government has decided to disburse arrears from last July along with the March salary.

 Each AIADMK MLA, for the first time, will get Rs 1.05 lakh (increased pay) monthly salary. They will also get Rs 4 lakh each as arrears from July to February. The arrears is Rs 50,000 per month, said an official.
 
 Even within the AIADMK, 18 MLAs who were disqualified in September last by speaker   under the anti-defection law will not get the salary hike. “As of now, all the 18 MLAs who have been disqualified will get arrears only till their disqualification date in September,” said the official.
 
 DMK, its allies and Dhinakaran declined to accept the hiked salaries on moral grounds after the government refused to heed to demands of the transport employees to hike their salary. “We are getting only Rs 55,000 salary. All MLAs of the DMK and our allies have given letters saying we will not take the salary hike,” said a DMK leader.
