In the wake of   case, the entire nation has revolted against the crime and has been constantly demanding for a death penalty against these miscreants. Several   celebrities have also voiced out their opinions against the horrendous crime. Recently,   who was present at the song launch of his upcoming film ‘102 Not Out’, was asked about his take on the Kathua rape case.

 Amitabh refused to comment on it and asked the media not to rake up the issue and that he feels “disgusted” even talking about it. This reluctance of the veteran   confused the actor-director,   and so she took to Twitter to remind people of his film ‘Pink’, where Big B essayed the role of a lawyer who determinedly defended a woman’s right to consent.
 
 
 She wrote, “I can’t help being reminded of a film called #Pink. Can our images on-screen please be reflected in reality?” This comment by Pooja Bhatt fetched her unending trolls on Twitter. Many users even got her battle with alcoholism in the picture. One Twitterrati wrote, “A known alcoholic trying to gain publicity by using the name of a legend.”
 
 
 To which Pooja, who quit drinking in December 2016, replied by saying, “A ‘recovering’ alcoholic and proud of it. In a country where people don’t even acknowledge they have a drinking problem, let alone discuss it, I am grateful to stand away from the crowd that considers holding your frailties to light shameful. #485dayssober.”
 
 
 Another user called Pooja “brainless” and wrote, “Only brainless thakelis like Pooja Bhatt would even think of comparing movie roles or fictional stories to real life issues.”
 
 
 However, Pooja did not pay much heed to these trolls and replied with a single word.
