AHMEDABAD: On the first day of the 2018 edition of  , on Monday, Pandit   reminded the audience that beauty does not lie in simple precision. Inexperienced listeners rush to determine the particulars — the name of the raga, its supposed mood, and the beat cycle. But   began his performance with a challenge. “I will play a new composition,” he told the audience. “You will have to tell me what that raga should be called.”

 With that exercise, Panditji — the legendary flautist — seemed to be suggesting that art can be a medium of self-revelation if the audience doesn’t rummage through it for revelatory meanings. In a London Review of Books essay, “Humph, He, Ha” (January 4, 2018), Julian Barnes describes a common anxious reaction to a painting: “…when in front of a picture, [we] do not give the picture time enough to speak,” Barnes writes. “We talk at it, about it, of it, to it; we want to forcibly understand it…” But on Monday, Panditji shut off the possibility of gossip about the raga’s character. The audience had to hear its voice, its claims about its genealogy, and its statement of purpose — because Panditji had presented it without antecedents.
 
 Talking to TOI, Panditji said: “I wanted the audience to examine their own memories. What people projected to my composition was based on their individual remembrances of other ragas.” Panditji said that was exactly what he wanted. “Rasikas began to think for themselves, they let the music shape their thoughts,” he said. “Some recommended that I name the raga after me! But I wouldn’t do that!”
 
 In the end, Panditji told the audience that his new creation was called “Niranjani”. Panditji had made a new raga seem like rasikas’ recollection of their individual truths about beauty.
