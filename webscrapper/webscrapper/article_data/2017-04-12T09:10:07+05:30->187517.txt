NEW DELHI: A 13-year-old girl, Pooja, was mowed down by a speeding bus after it hit the bike on which she was riding with her father and younger sister to school in north Delhi’s Burari on Tuesday morning. While her sister sustained grievous injuries on her arm, her father was unhurt.

 Police said that the bus crushed Pooja’s head when she fell off the bike. She was declared brought dead by doctors at the hospital. The private bus was on school duty when the incident occurred.
 
 Pooja’s father Munna Lal, who was riding the bike, is a mason. “The bus was trying to overtake us from the wrong side. It suddenly cut across and I ended up hitting the bus after which both the girls fell off. The rear wheel of the bus crushed Pooja’s head and ran over her sister’s right hand,” he said.
 
 A mob soon collected at the accident spot. They asked the schoolchildren to get off the bus and smashed the windows. “The driver, Param Singh, fled after the accident but was later nabbed from his house,” said a senior police officer.
