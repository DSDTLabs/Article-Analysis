NEW DELHI: The Delhi unit of Congress on Wednesday slammed the   government for the “massive” increase in fixed charges. DPCC chief Ajay Maken claimed that it would put an “additional burden of Rs 1,510 crore on power consumers by way of   and surcharge”. 

 He said: “AAP government has hit the common people the hardest with the massive increase in fixed charges, as it has decreased the power subsidy to the poor by 23.6%.” He claimed that whether the consumer used electricity or not, the power companies would charge each family fixed charges ranging from Rs 210 to Rs 3,900 per month. 
 
 Delhi   chief Manoj Tiwari demanded an immediate rollback o.He said whatever benefits that consumers had got so far were due to the “sustained campaign” by consumer organisations and BJP. Accusing AAP government of not opposing the fixed charge hike before  , Tiwari said: “AAP has denied the consumers full benefit of the tariff decrease.” 
 
 He also claimed that in a few slabs, people would end up paying more. “The decrease in power tariff makes it clear that, for the last three years,   were making huge profits and, hence, almost Rs 6,000 crore that the government had given in subsidy to discoms was a big scam,” Tiwari said.
