NASHIK: Chief minister   is believed to have assured a delegation of cash-strapped Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank to release its deposit of Rs 239 crore held by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank. 

 “We met the chief minister on Tuesday night at 10.30 and sought his attention towards serious problems being faced by   due to lack of cash with the bank. He has promised to hold a meeting of cooperative and finance department on Thursday and release our deposit with the MSC Bank,”   chairman   said.
 
 “The farmers who are expecting loan waiver have not paid a penny back to the NDCC. Our own funds of Rs 342 crore, in the form of scrapped currency notes, have been blocked as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is not exchanging it. So, we have sought our deposit with the MSC Bank so that we can deposit the money with nationalised banks and get   that can be given to farmers,” Darade said. 
 
 “We are hopeful that the deposit is released from the MSCB. We will be able to help at least the small farmers before the kharif season begins,” Darade said.
 
 ‘Will quit if notes not exchanged’: The NDCC Bank chairman Narendra Darade has warned of putting in his papers if the demonetised notes of the bank were not exchanged. 
 
 “I have decided to resign from the post of chairman if the demonetised notes are not exchanged. If I am not able to do justice to two lakh account holders, then I should not hold the post,” Darade said.
