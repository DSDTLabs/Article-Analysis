TRICHY: As speakers propagating atheist philosophy slammed religious beliefs, especially in Hinduism, at the World Atheist Conference here, the concept of spiritual politics espoused by superstar   also came in for sharp criticism. 

 Though Rajini’s concept was much debated over the past few days, some speakers found it nascent and lacking clarity. However, Dravida Kazhagam leader   said that people propagating ideology of spiritual politics would be exposed sooner than later. 
 
 Speaking on the sidelines of the conference, he said spiritual politics was nothing but a tool that might be used to deceive people. Politics was in no way related to spirituality. Spiritual politics stressed on the existence of spirit which was called ‘Atma’. 
 
 The aim of the conference was to counter the very existence of spirit through philosophical arguments. Those trying to mislead people in the name of spirit would be exposed soon, he said. 
 
 Lakshman Tamil from Periyar International, USA said that those thinking about starting a political party in the state could not ignore Periyar or Dravidian movement for their brand value. He said that one could become popular in the state by invoking the name of Periyar. 
 
 Lakshman recalled how his father had told him to be honest also when he expressed his wish to become an atheist like Thanthai periyar. Periyar had set high standards to be an atheist, he said. 
 
 Taking a jibe at  , Dravidian Tamil Federation general secretary Suba Veerapandian said that a person had recently visited Gopalapuram (the residence of DMK leader M Karunanidhi) to seek his blessings. 
 
 But little did he know that he could only get rationalist lessons from the leader and not his blessings. Rationalists and atheists had been criticising the actor for giving his political move a religious colour. Though Rajinikanth had come out in the open with a statement clarifying his stand, not many seemed to be convinced.
