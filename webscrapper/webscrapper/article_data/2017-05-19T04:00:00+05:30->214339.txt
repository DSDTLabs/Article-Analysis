AHMEDABAD: The standing committee of   has directed the administrative wing to prepared a road map for water supply to ensure that all the areas get adequate water and that the water is potable.

 Standing committee chairman Pravin Patel and mayor Gautam Shah convened an emergency meeting with the municipal commissioner and deputy municipal commissioner. The meeting came after   party members waved bottles of muddy, turbid water at the AMC general board meeting on Wednesday.
 
 At the meeting, the mayor and   chairman asked officials why several areas, especially in the walled city, were getting water that was not potable. The officials said there was a technical problem involved.
 
 Officials said there is rampant use of electric pumps in the walled city, which reduces flow to certain areas. With election to be held later this year, the ruling   is in no mood to give the Congress party an issue to rake up during the campaign.
 
 The Congress has been raising the issue of polluted water supply for the last couple of months. The Congress not only raised the issue at the board meet for two months straight, but also held dharnas in Shahpur and other areas.
 
 Officials said they were instructed to prepare a roadmap within a month and ensure that the enough water was supplied using the present network.
 
 Sources said that the elected wing also assured officials that if required they would get more water from the Narmada network, but want the hue and cry to be silenced. 
 
 The boat race held in the Sabarmati, as part of Gujarat Day celebrations, had led to the supply of turbid water in areas of the Walled City. Officials said that they had released water into the river to enable the boat race. This had moved algae and other contaminants into the water supply system.
