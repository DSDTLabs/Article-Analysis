Margao: The National Domestic Workers Movement (NDWM), at a rally held at Margao on Monday to mark International Workers’ Day, demanded that domestic help be recognized as workers and due rights be given to them. 

 “Recognize domestic help as workers by bringing domestic work under the schedule of employment and fix minimum wages for them under the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act 1948,” NDWM demanded. It also sought the constitution of a state social security board under the Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, or a separate welfare board for such workers.
