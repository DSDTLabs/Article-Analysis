 has just started shooting for his next film,  , directed by debutant Narasimha, in which he plays “a fun cop”. “The character is rather playful, to an extent that people around him have an issue with the way he conducts himself, but no one can fault him because he is very sincere with his work and does his job right,” explains Prajwal, adding that he is excited about playing a cop for the first time. 

 “I have been working on getting fit for the role for a while now. But everything fell into place only after we did a look test, during which I wore the khaki uniform. My family and the team loved it, which meant that my hard work had paid off. I must add that wearing a police uniform gives you a certain indescribable high and I am glad that I got a chance to do it,” says the actor.
 
 The film, says Prajwal, is not going to be the usual cop movie, with ample doses of entertainment, as well as a bit of horror. “There’s also a love story that is pivotal to the narrative. It is most definitely a masala flick, but treated differently,” he says.
 
 The actor will be paired with   actress  , in what will be her first film since tying the knot with  , a   filmmaker, earlier this month. Prajwal adds, “Bhavana’s got a great role in the film, and even though she does not know Kannada, she sits for hours together with her script to get her lines right while shooting. I am glad that we have got this opportunity to work together.”
