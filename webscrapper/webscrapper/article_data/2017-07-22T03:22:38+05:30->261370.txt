KOLKATA: The 21-year-old youth who crossed over to safety to the next building using a rope during Thursday’s   fire was not the only contender for the  . The caretaker of Aspiration Vintage, where the fire broke out on the third floor, was among those who risked his life to get many out of the flames. Ujjal Dey was back on his feet on Friday, assisting police, fire fighters and the forensic team who came to inspect the site.

 With a handkerchief tied around his nose, Dey on Thursday rushed up and down to escort many to safety. “It was risky, but I would have felt bad if anyone trapped became a casualty. It was part of my job,” Dey told TOI on Friday. 
 
 Even before the fire fighters arrived, the likes of Narayan Shaw — member of the support staff at the fourth-floor furniture unit Carpentro — tried to use the fire hose to douse the flames. But none of the fire-fighting equipment, including sprinklers, was functional. 
 
 Most of the 12 offices in the building could not operate on Friday. When TOI visited the building, thick layers of soot on the floors, walls and furniture showed that the fire could have caused major casualties.
 
 “The smoke could have killed us. I don’t know how I managed to rush down through the thick smoke unhurt. It must been sheer luck,” said Gopal Dey, a support staff who was found wiping the soot and clearing the glass shards in the building. 
 
 Sital Parida, who monkey-crawled to the next bulding on a rope, has been inundated with calls from friends and relatives lauding his bravery. “Last night I pondered over my risky act. But then I told myself that I would not gain anything by thinking about it. I would have loved to go back to work from today itself, but the office will remain shut for a few days,” he said.
