  asked the government to submit by next month the exact number of women, including officers, working in the police force.
 
 "When women comprise about 50 % of the total population, their presence in the police force is less than 5%. It is insufficient. How are you going to balance it?" the judge asked additional advocate  .
 
 Citing the incidents that marred New Year's Eve celebrations in the city, he felt they could have been prevented if there were sufficient number of policewomen. The AAG said there is vast difference between what actually happened and what was reported in the media. But the judge noted that even if the incidents were glorified, they had damaged the city's reputation to a great extent as they'd made national headlines.
 
 The court was hearing a batch of petitions seeking quashing of proceedings in several criminal cases due to delay in investigation because of staff shortage in the Karnataka police force.
