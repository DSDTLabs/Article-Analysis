NEW DELHI:  's wife Sunita and sacked   minister   engaged in a war of words on Monday.

 Sunita Kejriwal‚Äè took to Twitter to slam Kapil Mishra and said all the allegations levelled by the suspended AAP leader were false.
 
 Taking a dig at Kapil Mishra's allegations, Sunita said "When did you come to house on May 5? I did not get to know or else would have offered you a cup of tea as always."
 
 
 Calling Kapil Mishra a betrayer, she warned him against the consequences of his actions.
 
 "Law of nature never errs, seeds of betrayal, false allegations sown, so shall he (Kapil Mishra) reap. Inevitable," she tweeted.
 
 
 
 Kapil Mishra responded to Sunita's attack but refused to target her.
 
 Stating that she was unaware of the truth behind these allegations, he said   is worried over the declining fortunes of her husband.

 Sunita Kejriwal's remarks came a day after Kapil Mishra accused the Aam Aadmi Party of lying to the Election Commission (EC) about donations and laundering money through shell companies. Mishra fainted midway through a presser and was later hospitalised.
 
 Mishra had on Sunday alleged that the party concealed around Rs 36 crore from the party workers and the government.
