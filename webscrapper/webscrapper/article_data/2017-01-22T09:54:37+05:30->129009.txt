THEKKADY: The   has stopped the big   at   due to the low water level in the  , on Friday. On Thursday, it decided to stop service of the 120-seater 'Jalaraja' with the water level in the dam receding to 109 feet.

  Low water level in Thekkady lake hinders boat services as sand and tree trunks are clearly visible. Boating is the main tourist attraction at Thekkady as it offers a chance to watch the wild animals.
 
  In November also, following a request from the forest department, the KTDC stopped the operation of 'Jalaraja' for over 25 days. The forest department-owned three boats have already limited their capacity to 20 seats from 60. KTDC's 'Jalasundari' now allows only 30 people on its 55-seater boat.
 
  When water level recedes in Mullapperiyar, the boat jetty used to be shifted by creating a floating jetty to continue the boat service. But   deputy director Krishan Kumar told TOI that there is no plan to construct a floating jetty this time. Now, only four boat services are being operated at Thekkady by the KTDC.
