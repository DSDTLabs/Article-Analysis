SHIMLA: The Special National Investigation Agency (NIA) Court in Shimla on Thursday sentenced ISIS sleeper cell member   Khan (23) aka Abu Mohammad hailing from Bengaluru to five years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 50,000. Abid is currently lodged at Kanda jail in Shimla and had requested the court to shift him to a jail in Karnataka citing old age of his parents, but the court has not taken a decision on his request yet.

 NIA had arrested Abid from a church near the   area of Kullu district in December last year. Around a week ago, the court had convicted him for being a member of ISIS and indulging in unlawful activities. The court had also found him guilty under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the pronouncement of the quantum of punishment was decided on Thursday.
 
 After his two friends were arrested by NIA in January last year, Abid Khan officially adopted Christianity and changed his name to Neo Christian Paul to dupe security agencies. Though his name in all his documents, including passport is Abid Khan, son of Yusuf Khan, all his contacts in Kullu knew him by his Christian name Paul. 
 
 During the investigation it also came to light that after obtaining a passport in March last year, he went to Sri Lanka for about a month. Thereafter, he took shelter in the Sidhwa church. Abid had planned to go to   but he could not.
