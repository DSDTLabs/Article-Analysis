TRICHY: Trichy continues to top south Indian cities on the key parameter of   thus far in   2018, the pan-India cleanliness survey which will come to an end next month. As on Monday, the city stood third with regard to the maximum number of responses received from the public. 

  (SDMC) topped the chart and   (Madhya Pradesh) came second in the ranking based on citizen feedback recorded among 500 cities. Trichy also happens to be the only city to represent Tamil Nadu in the top 10 slots based on the citizen feedback count so far. In the past two seasons of Swachh Survekshan held in 2016 and 2017, Trichy had scored comparatively poor in citizen feedback out of the three major categories. This had cost the city much as it had to concede a few ranks to other civic bodies across the nation. However, the civic body had fared better than the top-scoring cities in documentation and independent observation, the other two categories. 
 
 The city is yet to receive its schedule for undergoing independent observation by a team entrusted by the Swachh Bharat mission under the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) which holds the survey. Unlike the past two seasons of Swachh Survekshan, the ongoing pan-India cleanliness survey would emphasise more on the citizen feedback with the category carrying 1,400 of the total 4,000 marks. To address their shortcomings learnt in the previous two seasons, the civic body had chalked out exclusive plans for boosting marks in the citizen feedback category. 
 
 “We created massive awareness among the residents welfare associations (RWA) and students to enable registration of feedback for the corporation’s activities.
