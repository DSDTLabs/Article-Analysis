THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Hoping to curb the tendency of   among motorists on Vellayambalam-Kowdiar stretch and thereby bring down number of accidents, the motor vehicles department on Tuesday commissioned their new camera system - Automated Speed Violation Detection System – on the stretch.

 This is the first ever speed violation detection camera system of the MVD in a city road in the capital. All other installations in the state are along national and state highways.
 
 Inaugurating the system, transport minister A K Saseendran said that the government had noticed that the stretch of road, which is of heritage value, has become a hotspot of accidents as the youths preferred to speed through the well maintained road. 
 
 “The new system enables to identify offenders and penalise them. But the government would not mind if less revenue is generated owing to better road culture of our people,” Saseendran said implying that the actual purpose of such systems was not to generate revenue but to create awareness on better road practices among public.
 
 Besides speed violation detection capabilities, the camera system is also equipped with the feature of Automatic Number Plate Recording (ANPR) system.
 
  The ANPR system, according to Keltron officials, would also help the law enforcers in crime investigation and detection of crimes such as hit and run cases.
 
 Both the speed detection and ANPR camera units employ global shutter technology, in which fast electronic shutter is used to capture even vehicles moving at a speed of 240km per hour. The cameras are designed to work under day and night conditions without depending on ambient light. Magnetic sensors placed on ground are used to detect speed violation. At present the maximum speed limit is set at 50km per hour.
