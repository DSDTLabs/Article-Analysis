MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday directed the public works department chief engineer and Kanyakumari district collector to survey the National Highway 47 connecting   and   in and to remove encroachments on it.

 Kumari Maha Sabha’s secretary Jeyakumar Thomas filed the public interest litigation stating encroachments on either side of the highway.
 
 When the petition came up for hearing before a division bench headed by Justice A Selvam, the petitioner’s side said that the 125 feet- width highway has shrunk into 80 feet due to encroachments.
 
 He said the revenue authority which is supposed to take action against encroachments was used to regularise the encroachments by giving pattas. Seeking to take action against the encroachments, the petitioner’s association gave many representations, but there was no action on them, the court was told.
 
 Following this, the bench directed the officers to remove illegal encroachments.
