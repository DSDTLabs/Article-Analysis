HYDERABAD: Over 110 children in state-run homes are up for adoption in Hyderabad. While around 800 prospective parents have been waiting for months owing to the long adoption procedure.

 Women and child welfare department in the city claimed 90% prospective parents prefer adopting kids in the age group of 0 to 5 years.
 
 “Most kids in state-run homes are above the age of
 
 six. As most parents prefer younger children, their waiting duration for adoption increases,” said Mohammed Imtiaz  , the District Child Protection Officer.
 
 Officials said it takes six months to a year for a couple to get the child’s custody.
 
 “The procedure for adoption is long; we waited nearly one-and-half years to get a child. First, we received a token number, accordingly, the department will do a background check,” said  , a private employee.
 
 Even though every month nearly four kids are adopted, number of parents waiting is consistently increasing, the   said.
 
 “Parents wait for almost a year before they adopt a child. There is a thorough background check on the family, starting from their medical history to financial capability and reason for adoption,” said Rahim.
 
 Some children take time to adjust in a new family. WCWD conduct regular checks on the family every six months for three years.
