INDORE: Increase in   of   will restrict imports and aid proper remuneration to local  , according to the  .

 To keep a lid on imported Kabuli chana in the country, the government raised import duty on it to 60 per cent from 40 per cent.
 
 All India Dal Mills Association president   said, “Imports were killing the local farmers, who were not able to sell their produce due to cheaper imports.”
 
 Agrawal said imports are not required this season because home production is much higher this year.
 
 Industry players said imports should be facilitated in years of lower output, but, when government stocks are full and coming crops are higher, there is no need for imports.
 
 Madhya Pradesh is the leading producer of pulses in the country with a share of 35-40 per cent in the total production, while Indore is a major trading centre for pulses.
 
 According to the association, local farmers are not even getting the minimum support price for their produce due to large amount of imported chana coming into the country from Australia and Canada.
 
 Industry players said due to higher production estimate of chana this year, prices have fallen to Rs 35 per kg as against Rs 55 per kg about three months ago.
 
 Agrawal said, “Chana production in 2017-18 is expected to be about 5 lakh tonne as against 2.5 lakh tonne a year ago.”
 
 New chana crop has started coming into the market while the peak arrival season is March-April.
 
 Industry players said farmers have shifted from wheat to chana this year expecting better prices.
 
 According to the statistics from the agriculture department, farmers have sown wheat on over 5.75 lakh hectare while chana has been sown on 4.75 lakh hectare in the entire Indore division.
