BENGALURU: A technical issue with the timing equipment imported from the United States played spoilsport as the organizers were forced to cancel the second and third (final) rounds of the   FMSCI   at the MMRT track in Sriperumbudur, on Sunday. 

 The championship title winners were declared on the basis of results of the first round that was run in Taneja Aerospace, Hosur in November. "It is most unfortunate that we had to call off the final two rounds of the 2016 MMSC   Indian National Drag Racing Championship due to failure in the timing system," said Farhan Vohra, the chairman of the event said. 
 
 "We could not rectify the timing system despite our best efforts and even after consultations with the manufacturer in the United States. Today, we put in place an alternate timing system, but errors crept in due to the incompatibility of the system to drag specific requirements. We had no choice but to call off this weekend’s programme after consulting with the sport’s governing body in India, the FMSCI," he said.
 
 "As a result, the champions in various categories were announced on the basis of the results of the first round that was held in Hosur in November. The Madras Motor Sports Club have announced refund of the entry fee for this weekend’s two rounds besides subsidizing transport costs incurred in bringing the competing vehicles to Chennai."
