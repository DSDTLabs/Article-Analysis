MUMBAI: Sunday is a special day for the state whose patron deity is Lord Ganesh.   are preparing to  , the  , on Sunday. Following the tradition of Ganesh Chaturthi, which arrives in August-September, mandals worship the idol of the lord for 10 days and immerse it in water bodies with pomp and ceremony. This year, the immersion is scheduled on January 30-31.

 Siddhivinayak temple in Prabhadevi conducts traditional pujas and rituals. For five days last week, the main idol was off-bounds for worshippers due to the ‘sindoor lepan’ ceremony, where a fresh coat of vermilion is applied to the idol before Maghi.
 
 The western suburb of Kandivli has two large mandals, the Charkopcha Raja and the Kandivlicha Shree. Sagar Bamnolikar of Kandivlicha Shree cites various reasons for choosing to host the lord at Maghi instead of Ganesh Chaturthi. “Mandals are crowded during August. Every street corner has an idol. But in January, more people arrive at the few Maghi pandals. Moreover, all items are available at regular prices, unlike the inflation during Ganeshotsav,” Bamnolikar says. This pandal will host games for senior citizens, haldi kumkum and ‘Home Minister’ style games for women.
 
 The oldest Maghi mandal in Mumbai is the Dusra Kumbharwada. Spokesman Akash Chaurasia says, “This is our 72nd year. We have daily film screenings and dance competitions for kids.”
 
 The Dadarcha Lambodar mandal is at the heart of celebrations in central Mumbai. Spokesman Sagar Rane says, “Next year is our 60th anniversary, which will be a grand affair. This season also, we will have bhajan recitations, vocal jugalbandi and drawing competitions.”
