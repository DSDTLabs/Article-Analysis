GURUGRAM: Chief minister   on Sunday asked the Haryana Police not to   any   registration, and promised punitive action against personnel, if they violate the order. The chief minister, while speaking at ‘Janta Darbar’, organised at the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad, rapped police after a person complained of laxity in   of FIR in a case of delay in delivery of flats by a private builder. 

 In   too, several cases have witnessed delay in police action and registration of FIRs in the last one year. In the Manesar rape incident, where a 19-year old woman was raped by three men in a Tata Magic-van, the FIR for rape was registered on June 3, two days after the woman had approached the police. A woman cop was suspended for laxity in filing an FIR in the case, and the charge of the investigation was given to the area assistant commissioner of police.
 
 In the same event, Khattar announced that all those unauthorised colonies of Faridabad will be regularised where residents have paid the prescribed development charges.
 
 “The state government has fixed development charges of Rs 1,250 per metre and the colonies where the residents pay these charges will be notified as authorised,” said Khattar.
 
 The chief minister also discussed about Rera where he assured the buyers. The chief minister said, “Once Rera comes into existence in the next two months, then either the developer will have to hand over the flat or refund the money taken from the buyer.” 
 
 He was hopeful that majority of the disputes between developers and apartment buyers will be resolved.
