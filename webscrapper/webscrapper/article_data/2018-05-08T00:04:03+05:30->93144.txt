Thiruvananthapuram: The deadline of amnesty scheme for owners of high-end vehicles, which are registered under bogus addresses in other states, ended on April 30. 

 This is posing a major problem for   officials as there is no secure space to park the vehicles which will be confiscated.
 
 “There is no land available to park such vehicles. They need to be parked in a secure space till the vehicle owners pay the dues. As these are high-end vehicles, any damage or loss to the vehicle would be huge burden on the department,” said an MVD official from the Thiruvananthapuram regional transport office.
 
 Recently, an MVD squad had seized a luxury bus, which was found operating a parallel service illegally near Chackai. It was taken to KSRTC depot in Enchakkal.
 
 “When the bus owner came to take the bus after paying the fine, the music system and some lighting equipment were found missing. Such incidents are a headache for MVD officials, as they will be held liable for the loss. A request to allot space to park the seized vehicles has been sent to the government,” added the MVD official.
