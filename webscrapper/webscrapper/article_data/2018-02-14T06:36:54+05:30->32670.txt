Retaining its position as the state with the  ,   has witnessed a marginal   over the last two years, stated the  .

 In 2015, trees covered an area of 9,558 sq km in the state. Last year, the figure was 9,831 sq km. However, environmentalists believe that inclusive efforts need to be taken to ensure a quality tree cover in the state. According to the report, “A net decrease of 17 sq km has been observed in the state which can be attributed to rotational fellings, submergence, agricultural expansion and other developmental activities. Although a decrease of 149 sq km has been observed within recorded forest area, the overall decrease has been offset due to expansion of tree cover outside forest areas. Rehabilitation efforts over west coast have led to increase in mangrove cover.”
 
 While agreeing to the survey findings in principle, head of the department of biodiversity at  , Ankur Patwardhan said that there is a lot of difference between qualitative and quantitative increase in tree cover. “The afforestation drive would have led to a quantitative increase in tree cover. But we need to see what the qualitative increase has been as these two are different parameters,” he explained.
