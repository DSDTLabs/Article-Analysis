KOLKATA: Congress’ Rajya   candidate   filed his nomination for the fifth   seat from West Bengal on Monday after chief minister Mamata Banerjee threw him the lifeline. 

 This is the second time after   that a   candidate is set to enter Rajya Sabha with   support, displaying a change in the power game in which Congress once used to call the shots. Banerjee’s party now wants Congress to give others the space they deserve at the national level to make an anti-BJP front work. 
 
 Congress’ growing dependence on Trinamool has also thrown a spanner in plans for a repeat of the 2016 Congress-Left alliance in Bengal as long as Trinamool enjoys a monopoly in the state. It is another matter that state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury and Leader of the Opposition Abdul Mannan made themselves conspicuous by their absence when Singhvi filed his nomination.
 
 Singhvi was flanked by Bhattacharya, possibly to send out the signal that he was a joint candidate of Congress and Trinamool. However, Singhvi’s tally of first preference votes will be the actual indicator of how far this political chemistry has worked in the RS polls when state Congress leaders do not seem very keen on it.
 
 Singhvi, however, faces a challenge from Left candidate Rabin Deb, who has taken care that the Congress leader doesn’t get a walkover. According to a senior TMC leader, Singhvi met the party’s brass. “We will put in our best to make Singhvi go to Rajya Sabha... On paper, Congress has 42 seats but effectively they have 33 votes. We will make up for the deficit,” the leader said.
 
 Asked whether Congress was looking to ally with Trinamool in the coming Lok Sabha election, Singhvi said: “It is too early to say anything regarding coalition in 2019.
 
 Trinamool, however, made it a point to mark the change. “Let us see whether we go with Congress or Congress comes with us,” party secretary general   said.
