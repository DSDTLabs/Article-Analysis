NEW DELHI:   gave Olympic champion   a run for his money before settling for a bronze in the 10m air pistol event in the   at the   here on Tuesday . After qualifying for the final with a moderate score of 577, the Indian came close to elimination a few times. But he held his nerve with high-scoring shots to set up a battle with Vietnam's Hoang for silver.

 Jitu went to the 22nd shot, which turned out to be the In dian's last, with a slight advantage over the Olympic gold medallist from Vietnam. An 8.6 against Hoang's 9.3, however, put paid to his hopes of a higher finish.
 
 But Jitu seemed happy with the outcome, as at one stage during the final, he was looking down the barrel. “I was struggling to get into a rhythm. I had a few low scores.I then knew that there's only one way to go and that's up. I started having better scores after that.“
 
 Even before the start of the final, Rai had his issues. His coach Pavel Smirnov said Jitu came to the final with a niggle in his right palm and was nervous. He had to pep him up. “I told him `don't fight with everybody , fight with youself '. I tried to release some of the tension that was building,“ the coach said.
 
 Jitu had a shaky start, with a 9.1 and 8.8 in his first two shots from a maximum 10.9 points while most of the others around him were shooting 10 and over. He shot inconsistently for two rounds before coming close to elimination a few times. He upped the game by a few notches to score four 10 plus scores to survive elimination twice. He had the Olympic champion virtually on the mat before his low-scoring last shot sealed his fate.
 
 The gold was won by   of Japan, who finished 3.5 points ahead of Hoang.
 
 This was Jitu's third international event after he faltered in Rio, where the country's shooters had failed to win a medal. In the other event of the day, Chain Singh started off well in the final before a series of low scores saw him finishing seventh in the men's prone event.
