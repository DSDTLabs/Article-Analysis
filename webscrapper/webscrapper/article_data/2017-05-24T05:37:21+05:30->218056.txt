MUMBAI: A one-member judicial inquiry commission will on June 15 finally commence hearings to find out the reason behind the collapse of a British-era bridge on the   near Mahad in Raigad. 

 The commission is headed by a retired Bombay high court judge, Justice S K Shah. It has senior advocate Dipan Merchant as its counsel. Shah and Merchant, along with the local collector and the police, visited the mishap site on May 12 for an inspection. 
 
 Merchant had also been the counsel for a two-member judicial committee appointed in 2011 to investigate the Adarsh housing society irregularities.
 
 The bridge over the Savitri was a 188-metre stone arch masonry structure constructed in 1928. On August 2, as the monsoon unleashed its fury and the river swelled. About 11.30 pm, the bridge was washed away. At least 29 people went missing after two buses and one private vehicle fell into the river. 
 
 The state PWD said there were 42 passengers in these three vehicles which were swept away. 
 
 The state had initially sought a report from an IIT-Bombay professor. It then appointed a one-member judicial commission looking at the seriousness of the disaster and keeping in mind that there were other similar old bridges across various rivers through the state. 
 
 The commission’s jurisdiction was to “investigate the sequence of events” and the “reasons behind the bridge getting washed away and the vehicles flowing away”. The commission, which in March sought details from a chief engineer, had to remind him again in April to produce the documents before it proceeds with the hearing next month. The commission has been given an office at the   near CST.
 
 The commission has also been tasked with fixing responsibility on any technical officer if found guilty and to recommend remedial measures to prevent such incidents.
