CHANDIGARH: Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh   on Wednesday asked CM   to come out with the details of foreign direct investment (FDI) and employment opportunities generated over the past three years, especially after the Happening Haryana summits.

 “The condition is such that the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) is not providing details under the RTI Act. The agency has not provided the details of the number of industries set up in reply to the queries made by a private person,” said Hooda while addressing mediapersons here on Wednesday.
 
 “We have everything on record that during our regime FDI of Rs 25,816 crore was made, which generated employment for 1,15,888 persons. At the same time, this government could generate employment for only 3,022 persons through industries set up during its tenure,” he maintained. Hooda also flayed Khattar over his foreign tour, ‘especially at a time when farmers are struggling to sell their produce’. “So far as foreign tours are concerned, let Khattar manage the projects set up by us for the diversification of crops. Though we have the doubts, we will welcome if the CM and his delegation gets investment for the state,” he said.
 
 He accused Khattar of patronizing corruption in recruitment by continuing with Bharat Bhushan Bharti as the chairman of the   (HSSC) despite controversies and allegations of corruption. The senior   leader said, “The commission should be instead termed as Haryana services sales counter.” Hooda also questioned HSSC’s move of introducing the interview system only in the recruitment process.
 
 “Now, time has come when we should take out the entire system of recruitment out of HSSC’s hands. Panjab University, Kurukshetra University (KU) or Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU) should be asked to conduct the written test followed by interviews by a committee constituted by Punjab and Haryana high court,” he added.
