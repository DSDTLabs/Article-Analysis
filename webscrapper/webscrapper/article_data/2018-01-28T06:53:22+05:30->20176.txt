 According to a source, the violence was a culmination of a bitter battle to gain control of   in Rabindranagar-Sukantapally in Ward 1 of South   Municipality. “The area still has a strong CPM presence and Manju Basu from the party is the councillor of the area. A group of locals owing allegiance to Trinamool is desperately trying to take control,” a resident said. The councillor’s husband, Jayanta, is associated with the club as a senior executive committee member.
 
 Locals said around 1.30am on Saturday some bike-borne goons hurled bombs at the club. “The noise woke up everyone and there was a panic in the area. Somebody in our locality is deliberately trying to create a ruckus to take control of the club,” said Jayanta Basu.
 
 Trinamool-run South Dum Dum municipality chairman Panchu Gopal Roy said the allegations were baseless. “Except the CPM councillor, all others in the locality are Trinamool supporters. So, why will anyone hurl bombs there?”
 
 “We are yet to receive any complaint. Officers from Dum Dum PS have visited the spot and a probe is on,” said Barrackpore commissionerate DCP (zone II) Dhrubajyoti De.
