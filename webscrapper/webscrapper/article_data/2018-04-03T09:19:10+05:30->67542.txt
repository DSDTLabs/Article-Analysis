 Box: ‘Keeping schools, colleges open worked well’
 
 Haryana police and civil administration heaved a sigh of relief as the situation came under control by the evening. According to the crisis management team of cops and bureaucrats, the decision of not closing educational instructions worked well. “Since institutions and offices were open and exams took place as per routine, maximum youths got occupied there. Secondly, our focus was to avoid community clashes. Such clashes started in Karnal, Narwana, Palwal, Jagadhari and   but use of force helped in diffusing the situation,” said a senior cop.
