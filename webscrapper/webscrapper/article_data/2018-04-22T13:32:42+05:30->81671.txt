VADODARA: Food safety officers of   (VMC) checked an edible oil shop in   area of the city after receiving a complaint that adulterated oil was being sold there. The teams collected samples of the oil and started the process of sealing the stock on Saturday.

 VMC officials said a citizen had made a call to a VMC official alleging that an edible oil depot in   in Fatehpura was selling ‘duplicate’ oil. Officers reached the shop immediately and started checking the stock there.
 
 “The officers have found filled edible oil tins of different brands as well as loose   oil at the shop. Palm oil is usually used to adulterate other edible oils. The stock is likely to be accounted for and sealed late in the night. If adulteration is found in the samples that we have collected, further action will be taken,” said VMC additional health officer Dr Mukesh Vaidya.
