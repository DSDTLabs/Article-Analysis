NEW DELHI: Delhi Commission for Women chief   on Friday went on an   against the Kathua and Unnao   incidents, demanding strong anti-rape laws. 

 Jaihind had on Thursday written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding concrete steps to curb sexual crimes. BJP veteran Yashwant Sinha also joined her at Rajghat. 
 
 “It is very sad that so many incidents of rape are happening in Delhi and the country. It is sending a wrong message across the world. Our country is being called ‘rape capital of the world’. Whatever happened in Kathua and Unnao is very shameful. It is very unfortunate that some people are trying to give the Kathua incident a communal angle. Parties should take strict action against these people. It is heartening to see that society is waking up to these incidents. All parties should come together to take action against crime against women,” Sinha said. 
 
 In the crowd were survivors of sexual crimes—parents of an eight-month-old baby who was raped two months ago, a   student who was molested in a moving bus some months ago and others. A survivor narrated the problems she faced while dealing with the police.
 
 “We have been demanding for the last 2.5 years that 66,000 more personnel should be given to Delhi Police along with better forensic labs and software. We need more and more fast-track courts so that trial could be completed in six months and rapists hanged,” she said. 
 
 Jaihind also hoped that Modi won’t let her strike go waste as she too is like his daughter, and would make India’s daughters feel safe.
