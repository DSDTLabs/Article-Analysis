BHOPAL: Transporters are protesting the regional transport office ( ) order to stop issuing fitness to commercial vehicles from Monday till the firms installing speed governors apply for fresh trade certificate.

 Since no company has registered with RTO for trade certificate they have stopped issuing fresh certificates.
 
 The new notification mandating transport commissioner’s approval for firms installing speed governors was issued after the Indore school bus incident and it came into effect from Monday. Confusion prevailed at the RTO office as the fate of devices installed in the buses in the past remains uncertain. As per RTO records, there are around 88,000 commercial vehicles registered who got speed governor devices installed in 2017.
 
 However, if those companies are unable to fulfil the fresh standards for trade certificates, the vehicle owners will be required to get new devices installed.
 
 Meanwhile after the confusion, the transport department advised the RTO to issue fitness to those vehicles whose certificates are lapsing within the next seven days to avoid them from paying penalty.
 
  
  
 Bhupendra Kumar Jain, transport expert, alleged that, “Post-Indore school bus accident, the officials of transport department are now saying that speed governors that were installed last year are not valid. But why those speed governors were approved last year, if they had to be made invalid this year?” he asked. “We had spent a lot of money on them,” he added.
 
 “Actual cost of these devices is not more than Rs 1,000, but the companies are selling it for Rs 10,000. Still RTO doesn’t intervene to control prices.”
 
 Transport commissioner   said, “We will make sure that no one is charged with penalty for delay in fitness. We have received few queries on procedure to apply for trade certificates on Monday. I think, within this week, a few companies will get trade certificate after which vehicle owners can get   by installing those devices.”
