  on Monday in connection with the 
  . Ramanand, who examined the firm's documents, told TOI, “The security firm had applied for a renewal of its licence but it has not been renewed as yet. It still continued to operate.“
 
 “It appears some leeway was provided to the private security firm during the course of renewal of the licence. However technical the issue may be, the agency should not have functioned if its licence to operate had lapsed,“ he said.
 
 The firm had taken a valid security licence in 2011 under the provisions of The Private Security Agencies (Regulation) Act, 2005. “There are no adverse remarks against the agency in the last five years,“ he said. The firm had applied for renewal and, on January 28, a letter was dispatched to the firm raising a few queries and seeking more documents. “The firm is yet to respond to the letter,“ he said.
 
 Ramanand said police are checking out whether legal charges can be invoked against the agency . Repeated calls made to the board line numbers of the firm did not evoke much response from any official of the firm.
