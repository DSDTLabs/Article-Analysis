SHIMLA: The issue of making   the second capital of Himachal Pradesh again raised its hood with opposition BJP legislators attacking the Congress government during the ongoing budget session on Tuesday. While Dehra MLA of BJP Ravinder   demanded “darbar move” for Dharamshala on the pattern of Jammu and Kashmir, Naina Devi MLA of BJP Randhir Sharma suggested that the move had been initiated only for votes.

 Participating in the discussion on the governor’s address, Ravi said that the announcement of the second capital was made for political reasons. He said it would be accepted only if offices were shifted to Dharamshala on the pattern of Jammu and Kashmir, where offices shift to Srinagar for six months in summer and to Jammu for six months in winter. He said that the previous BJP regimes had already shifted many of the offices to Dharamshala and added that the Congress government had only completed the paper work.
 
 Sharma said that to cover up regional politics, the state government was giving such “lollypops” to people. He said that chief minister   government had started the tradition of winter sojourn for people of Kangra in 1993 but people had then voted Congress out of power. He further said that the expenditure of having state assembly in Dharamshala was Rs 50 crore for only for five days a year. He claimed that this time also the Congress after making the announcement would not return to power.
 
 The MLA continued that the statement of CM that he loved Kangra itself depicted regionalism. He maintained that the latter was saying so because the district had 15 assembly seats. He also dared Virbhadra to project someone from Kangra district as a chief ministerial candidate.
