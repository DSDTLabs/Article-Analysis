PUNE:   leader   on Sunday told party workers to end the   in   in this civic election. 

 “The BJP is ruling in the Centre and the state. The city has given 100% represen- tation for the party in the state assembly and in Parliament. The time has come to ensure that the BJP wins the local election,” Mahajan said while addressing a   (BJYM) function here. 
 
 She was felicitated by its state unit on her recent appointment as national president.
 
 Mahajan said the NCP and the Congress had failed to address civic issues for 15 years and it was necessary to throw out their rule from the civic body. The BJP-head state government has sanctioned key projects for Pune in the last two years, she said. 
 
 The morcha will work for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a developed nation, she added. BJYM workers will work to bring change to implement his ideas and programmes, she added.
