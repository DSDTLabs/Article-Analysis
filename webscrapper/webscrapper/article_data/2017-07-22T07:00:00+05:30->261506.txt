Chandigarh: Professionals and members of civil society have come forward to help the 10-year-old rape survivor from Chandigarh after TOI reported on July 18 that she was 26 weeks pregnant.

  The Chandigarh district court had refused an abortion given her tender age and the risk to her life. The girl had been raped several times allegedly by her maternal uncle. While the father is a government employee, the mother is a domestic help.
 
 A number of lawyers, doctors and rights organisations are ready to provide the girl and her family free legal aid, financial help and counseling. Among those who have come forward is Amnesty International. 
 
 Its campaigner Makepeace Sitlhou will visit the family on Monday. She told TOI, “We can provide legal aid and act as a pressure group. We will see how to help the family after meeting them. We will also see if it is possible to get better compensation for them.” Hariharan Iyer from Mumbai, who is working with an IT company, is willing to extend financial help to the family.
