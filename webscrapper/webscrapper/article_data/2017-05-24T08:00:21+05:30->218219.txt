NEW DELHI: AAP’s founding member   is on his way out, sacked minister   claimed on Tuesday. He alleged that Vishwas was in the line of fire and he would have been shown the door a fortnight ago but AAP postponed the decision because of Mishra’s “exposures”.

 Barely a month ago, frictions appeared between Vishwas and AAP after his views differed from the party’s official stand on the recent defeats in Punjab and Goa assembly polls as well as Delhi civic elections.
 
 The rift widened when AAP’s Okhla MLA   alleged that Vishwas was working for BJP-RSS and was eyeing the post of national convener. Vishwas was disappointed when party did not move fast to suspend Khan. He said that Khan would have been suspended immediately had he spoken anything against CM Arvind Kejriwal or his deputy Manish Sisodia.
 
 It all subsided in the first week of May when AAP suspended Khan and pacified Vishwas. But there were fresh rumours when Vishwas skipped an AAP convention on Sunday. Vishwas is a member of AAP’s powerful political affairs committee (PAC) and all PAC members were invited to the meeting.
 
 A senior AAP functionary, who did not wish to be identified, said it was a baseless speculation by Mishra. “I do not want to say anything on this.”
