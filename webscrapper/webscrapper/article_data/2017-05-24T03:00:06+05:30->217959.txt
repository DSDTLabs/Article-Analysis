NOIDA: The   wrote to   CEO Amit Mohan Prasad on Tuesday on the many unauthorised RO (reverse osmosis) plants operating in residential sectors as well as wastage of groundwater by builders in the city.

 The   ( ) demanded that these unauthorised RO plants be shut down and builders be stopped from extracting groundwater leading to not only their low levels, but also wastage.
 
 The RWA federation also urged the Authority to draft clear plans and policies with immediate effect for rainwater harvesting in industries, institutions, official buildings and parks across the city to avoid future shortage of clean drinking water in the city as faced by many sectors currently.
 
 “Many residents and RWAs have complained to us about unauthorised RO water plants operating in their sectors or neighbouring villages leading to not only wastage of groundwater, which they extract to bottle RO water, but also wastage of untreated water flowed into the drains,” said N P Singh, FONRWA president.
 
 Singh said the builders, with many projects across the city, were an additional source of the water wastage in the city, what with their unhindered extraction of groundwater to carry on construction as well as supply work in the many multi-storeyed housing complexes.
 
 “These unauthorised RO water plants and the builders’ projects are the main reason for the constant depletion of groundwater levels to nearly under 200 feet from the earlier 60ft in the city. Unless the Authority curtails this menace, we are on the verge of an acute water shortage in the coming days,” Singh said.
 
 He said FONRWA has written to CEO Prasad to draw up plans with immediate effect for rainwater harvesting in industries, institutions, official buildings and parks across the city to avoid drinking water shortage.
