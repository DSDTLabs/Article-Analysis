GHAZIABAD: In the name of  , some people have been committing crimes against trees and the environment for long, said Vijay Pal Baghel, also known as the ‘Green Man.’ 

 Baghel is the president of an organisation called ‘Pariyavaran Sachetak Samiti’ which has been asking people not to cut trees or its branches for the pre-Holi ritual of   Dehan. Baghel’s organisation chooses a week before Holi and visits schools, colleges etc to create awareness. “In the olden days,   used to be a community affair and the whole village or people of a residential colony used to hold one such pyre to mark the day. But when urbanisation took place, the world started shrinking and people started getting away from each other. They began competing with each other to hold a better bonfire than the other. Thus, the damage to the environment started increasing,” said Baghel. 
 
 According to Baghel, more than 5-6 quintals of wood, extracted by chopping numerous small trees and branches of bigger trees is used annually.
 
  “People do not just use dry wood, or just cowdung cakes, they sacrifice smaller trees entirely for their merriment and the damage becomes immense. The green wood, which is moist, does not burn entirely on the same evening and keeps smouldering for days, thus polluting the air even further,” said Baghel.
