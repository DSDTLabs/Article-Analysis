It was in the year 2013 that   first entered a film set. Having worked in the IT sector his job as an assistant director on the film was one of the most enriching experiences. 

 Four years later, Jayanth had gathered enough confidence to helm his own film, the much-hyped  . "My stint as an editor at a studio helped me gain further knowledge on cinema and that has helped me immensely in my craft," shares the debutant. 
 
 96 is a thriller that is made on a modest budget and whose trailer has already garnered much appreciation. 
 
 
  
 
 "The studio where I work is a rather quaint one and is situated in an old bungalow in Sheshadripuram. One night, while watching TV, it dawned on me that why not make a thriller that is based in this setting? I immediately started going about the script and here it finally is. I am grateful to Rakshit Shetty, Rishab Shetty and   for gracing the launch of my trailer. They have always been a huge support to me," he smiles. 
 
 96 has anchor/TV host   as its female protagonist.
