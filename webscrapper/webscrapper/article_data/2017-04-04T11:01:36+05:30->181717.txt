HYDERABAD: Cracking down on restaurants that were reportedly using unhygienic and unstamped meat, the   (GHMC) began imposing fines on Monday. As of 3 pm, the GHMC’s health and sanitation wing raided as many as six eateries and collected fines to the tune of Rs 1.30 lakh.

 The crackdown, officials said, was conducted in the wake of a decision taken at a recent convergence meeting. “We had taken a decision to conduct raids after officials from the water board told us that many eateries were letting sewer water seep into their cellars, where they store vegetables and meat,” said Ravi Kiran, additional commissioner (health and sanitation) of GHMC.
 
 A few of the prominent eateries that were fined include   at RTC crossroads,   at Nalgonda crossroads, Al Saba   in Gachibowli, Paradise Hotel at IS Sadan and   in SD Road. In a few cases, restaurants were fined for procuring meat from illegal slaughter houses.
