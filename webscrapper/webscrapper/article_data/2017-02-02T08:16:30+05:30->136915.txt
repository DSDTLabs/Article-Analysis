KOCHI: The reduced tax rate for small and medium size enterprises proposed in the   will benefit the rubber industry in the state, said G Krishna Kumar, vice chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII). 

  Speaking to TOI following a discussion with CII members, Kumar, who is also the managing director of Rubfila, pointed out that a significant percent of industries in the state are small and medium size enterprises (SMEs). 
 
 "I am from the rubber industry. Except for the tyre sector, all other sectors are generally SMEs and the lowering of taxes in the Budget will help the SMEs. So, the Budget can boost the rubber sector," he said. Most members of CII termed the budget as "balanced and positive". 
 
 "The Budget has opened several new avenues for farmers. The interest waiver for two months for farmers who had taken loans from district cooperative banks was a move in the right direction," said Shivadas B Kumar, managing director of the Sterling Group.
 
 He said that the success of the economic policies hinge on the state government's capacity to utilise the opportunities presented by the   present. 
 
 "The finance minister said that he will frame a model law on contract farming. It will provide new possibilities for farmers in the state," said MSA Kumar, managing director of AVT Natural Products.
