PUNE: Two men were   by the police on Monday for brutally attacking a 21-year-old youth on Saturday, causing severe facial injuries. 

 The two suspects also pelted parked cars with stones, breaking three windshields. 
 
 After a petty quarrel took a violent turn, both the suspects also smashed a stone into the victim’s face, breaking two of his teeth. He had to be rushed to a nearby medical facility, from where he was discharged after some preliminary treatment. 
 
 Ganesh Jori (21) and Shankar Nivekar (22), both of Kothrud, were arrested under section 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 Vinod Khengre and a friend were on their way to   to attend a birthday party around 9.30pm when the Jori and Nivekar waylaid them. 
 
 “The suspects started verbally abusing Khengre over a petty issue, provoking Khengre into a brawl,” Ramesh Chandiwade, assistant inspector of Kothrud police station, said. 
 
 That was when the suspects started attacking the victim with a stone, before pelting cars parked along the same road. 
 
 After receiving a complaint on Saturday, the cops made the arrests. “Jori is unemployed, while Nivekar is a private employee,” Chandiwade said.
 
 Further investigations are on, police said.
