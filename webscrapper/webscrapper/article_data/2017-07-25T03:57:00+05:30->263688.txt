Panaji: Goa’s rich mangrove forest cover along its estuaries need to be mapped to ensure their protection, executive secretary of the mangrove society of India (MSI), A G Untawale said, adding that the government must take up this initiative. Mangrove cover has been mapped along the coast but not along the estuaries, he pointed out, and that MSI has proposed that the government take up the initiative. “Mangroves have several advantages for our society. If not protected, mangroves will badly impact our ecology. They protect our land from erosion. A lot of land would be lost if it weren’t for mangroves,” professor Sunil Kumar Singh said. He has recently been appointed as director CSIR-National institute of Oceanography (NIO), Dona Paula. He also announced a two-day national conference on mangrove ecosystems at NIO-Goa from July 26, which marks the silver jubilee anniversary of MSI. The day is celebrated as World Mangrove Day. During the conference, MSI will sign an MoU with CSIR-NIO to work jointly on mangrove research. Various traditions connected with mangrove ecosystems, including that of the ‘Mannge Thapnee’, where villagers in Ponda attempt to pacify the sea by worshipping crocodiles, will be part of a biodiversity exhibition. The MSI will present awards to six experts from across the country, who have contributed to conservation and management of mangrove through their life, and will also felicitate few unsung heroes. “The mangrove ecosystem has huge potential for adventure, education, research, recreation and social activities,” Untawale said, adding that the first phase; of creating awareness about mangroves of the proposed mangrove park at Patto has been complete. A booklet on Mangal Yatra, the destinations for mangrove tourism will be released at the conference.
