DUMKA: Dumka deputy commissioner   on Sunday took a serious note of the gross insensitivity displayed by   authorities in terms of not providing a shroud to a deceased youth of a primitive tribe who succumbed to his injuries during a road accident on Saturday.

 Basant Dehri, a Pahariya youth, had sustained multiple injuries during a road accident that occurred in   police station area of the district and was rushed to Sadar Hospital for treatment. He, however, succumbed to his injuries.
 
  d body was then sent for post mortem on a trolley stretcher by simply wrapping him in a government banner of National Health Mission instead of a proper shroud on Saturday evening.
