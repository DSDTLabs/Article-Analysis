NAGPUR: A 23-year-old monk from   district in   has been arrested repeatedly raping a mentally challenged woman on Buddhist temple premises near   river on   for last six months.

 The woman (23), who hardly understands anything, was completely unaware about being sexually exploited until she started suffering from severe stomach ache and was brought to Mayo hospital.
 
 She revealed her sufferings in front of social workers as doctors said she might have conceived, after conducting her primary medical examination. However, the reports were later found to be negative.
 
 The survivor’s parents approached Yashodhara police station and lodged a complaint against the accused, Shubh Talubdar. Soon after registering an offence of rape against Talubdar, police reached the temple and arrested him on Thursday. On Friday, police produced him before the court which remanded him in police custody till May 29.
 
 Cops said Talubdar, who was bound to celibacy in which any kind of sexual behaviour is forbidden, came to the city in 2014. Woman, a school dropout, used to go to the temple for offering prayers along with her friends quite often. The first incident took place in November 2016. 
 
 “It was surprising that nobody, including the survivor’s friends, was unaware of the crime. Her parents took her to the hospital as she could not bear the pain. Doctors told them about the primary medical examination reports. However, the survivor didn’t say anything then. Later, she disclosed the everything though she couldn’t figure out what happened to her,” said PSI UA Rathod.
