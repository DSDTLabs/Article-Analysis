LUCKNOW: With sporadic terror related incidents being reported in the state, a team of commandos under   will remain deputed in Ayodhya throughout  . Four cases in which explosives were used to create panic have been reported in UP this month, resulting in heightened security concerns.

 Inspector general ATS Asim Arun said a 14-member team under DySP rank officer was sent to Faizabad and Barabanki, on Tuesday. “Back-to-back incidents have been reported since March 17 in Agra, Lucknow and Sultanpur districts. On Tuesday, crude bombs were recovered in eastern UP, hence we are being extra cautious in guarding Ayodhya and other vital installations in the state during Navratri,” said Arun. The team will remain there till the end of Navaratra. 
 
 ATS commandos inspected Dewa Sharif, the religious shrine in Barabanki district. Terror suspect Saifiullah who was gunned down in Haji Colony in Lucknow on March 7 was reportedly planning to attack the Sufi shrine and his plans were mentioned in the diary recovered from the house.
 
 ATS is struggling to locate lone-wolves determined to launch dangerous attacks in the state but remain far away from police scanner. As a six-member terror module with Kanpur roots was busted on March 7, ATS feels many more self-radicalised youths may be looking to carry out terror strikes. “It is important to understand that such fanatics treat all Muslims who do not believe in jihad or Ahle Hadith sect as enemies. Parents should watch out,” said Arun. The officer feels some youths are experimenting with what they have picked up on internet on how to launch terror attacks.
 
 The law enforcement agency created to combat terror had flagged three online portals which are used widely to indoctrinate youths. Lately, however, youths have started using proxy server before logging on, making it difficult to be tracked.
