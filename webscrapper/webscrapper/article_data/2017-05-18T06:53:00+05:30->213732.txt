CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday assured the Centre of his government’s commitment to implement the   ( ) Act, 2016, and said that the Union government-aided   and housing projects funded during the previous regime were brought on track and executed at the earliest.

 The issues came up for discussion during the chief minister’s meeting with Union minister of housing and urban poverty alleviation M Venkaiah Naidu in Delhi on Wednesday.
 
 Amarinder apprised the minister of the progress made by his government since coming to power two months ago, on the implementation of the various Central schemes and projects for which the government had released funds in the past but the same had not reached intended beneficiaries.
 
 He assured the Union minister that his government had already initiated the process for implementation of RERA without diluting the spirit of the legislation in any way. To a suggestion from the chief minister on adoption of certain rules from other states to strengthen the Act, Naidu said the Centre had no objection as long as there was no dilution of the spirit of the law, according to a spokesperson in the Punjab chief minister’s office. 
 
 Naidu is planning to visit Punjab in July to review the progress of the Central projects.
