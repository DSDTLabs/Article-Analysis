 is commonly understood in Goa as the month where a large chunk of the   restricts its diet to vegetarian food, with   like alcohol. As Goa’s most popular  , Ganesh Chaturthi marks the end of the Hindu month of Shravan, and the vegetarian diet is seen as a build-up to the festival. But researchers of Goan culture say that the origins of the observance of Shravan in Goa come from the locals’ desire to compliment nature’s processes during this period.

 The fifth month of the Hindu lunar calendar, Shravan, is considered the holiest as the most number of festivals fall during this period – like Gokulasthami, Sootha Punav and Nag Panchami. Researchers though see Shravan as the month designated to indulge in nature’s abundance during the Goan monsoon.
 
 The vegetarian fare consumed during Shravan appears to be designed to make the best use of the monsoon offerings 
 like the seasonal alu leaves and root, taikilo, ankur, ambade, bamboo shoot, phaglam, tauxem, etc.
 
 It is not a surprise then that the reverence to nature is so obvious in practices like Shravan Aitaar, which sees married women carry out a symbolic worship of the sun god on each Sunday of this Hindu month, making use of seasonal flowers and leaves.
 
 “Besides consuming fish, our ancestors would hunt for wild animals for consumption back then. Keeping away from non-vegetarian food during Shravan provides rest for this wildlife as well as for the marine life to recuperate, meaning to breed and replenish. Similarly, for individuals, this restricted diet helps in an annual detoxification of their system,” says Sanjeev Sardessai.
