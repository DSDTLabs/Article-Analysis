MOHALI: Panic gripped Phase 3B2   and nearby residential areas in   after two   opened fire in the air in front of a fast-food joint around 12.30pm on Thursday.

 After firing a single shot in the parking lot, the youths fled in an i-20 car bearing Uttar Pradesh registration number. The police said, “Their identity and motive are yet to be established. It’s also not known if they used a gun or a pistol.”
 
 No one was injured, but customers and shopkeepers panicked. Fast-food restaurant manager Sanjeev Kumar said at the time of firing, some cars were parked in the lot and people were eating inside. Restaurant employees and customers witnessed the incident and informed the police.
 
 A team from Mataur police station reached the spot. Police said no shell was recovered and they were examining statements of the eyewitnesses.
 
 “I was inside the restaurant when I heard a gunshot. I came out along with others and saw two youths getting into an i-20 car with a UP licence plate and speeding away,” said a restaurant customer on condition of anonymity.
 
 Investigating officer Harwinder Singh said, “An eyewitness had noted down the registration number of the car, but it is fake. A case has been registered. We are trying to identify the accused. Call data will be secured from the network providers. We are also scanning footages of   cameras installed in the area and nearby places.”
