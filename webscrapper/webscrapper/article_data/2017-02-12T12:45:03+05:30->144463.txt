BHOPAL: Faced with declining profits and poor order books, BHEL Bhopal unit is mulling to hand over management of schools run by its education society (BHEL Shiksha Mandal) to private players. Recently, the PSU also had to cut down on the bonus of their workers in  .

 Trade unions on the other hand oppose any such move. Sources said as BHEL is not able to continue with subsidy for the schools, there is a possibility that management of the schools will be handed over to  . It has also been proposed to increase the monthly fee of the schools.
 
 BHEL Shiksha Mandal has been running Jawahar Public School and Vikram Higher Secondary School for the past 40 years. Children of BHEL employees’ living in the township study in these schools as their fee is subsidised by 50%.
 
 A worker on the condition of anonymity, said, “Reputation of a school like Jawahar in Bhopal is very good and one of the reason for it is because of the effective management by BHEL. If the school management goes to someone else the reputation of the school will also be affected.”
 
 Deepak Gupta, president, INTUC (youth wing) said, “A similar action was proposed three years ago, as well. During that time, we had suggested that instead of changing the management, BHEL should find a way to plug its losses.”
 
 The schools are a good option for BHEL employees as the fee charged for their wards is less. “What will we do, if private owners increase the monthly fee? This will be an extra burden on BHEL employees,” Gupta added.
 
 According to him, the BHEL Shiksha Mandal has been increasing the fee by almost 10% every year. “Even if BHEL wants to stop the subsidy they should have been done in a phased manner. Taking any sudden step will put our children in trouble,” said Gupta.
 
 When contacted, vice-president of BHEL Shiksha Mandal, SB Singh told TOI, “The issue was discussed, but no decision has taken so far.”
