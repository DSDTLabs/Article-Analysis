TIRUMALA:   The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) is planning to ramp up its security infrastructure by   such as high-resolution cameras with facial recognition technology.

 The new state-of-the-art security features that are in the pipeline will cost an estimated Rs 15 crore, and some of them are expected to be put in place by the time the annual Brahmotsavams begin in September. The TTD is planning to double the number of closed circuit television cameras (CCTVs) from the present 640 to about 1,300.
 
 These new cameras would be of a higher resolution of about 4 MP as compared to the existing 1.3 MP  . Some of these cameras, especially those at the Alipiri toll/security gate would be equipped with facial recognition technology. These cameras would be mounted on the door frame   (DFMD) through which pilgrims have to pass after they alight from their vehicles at Alipiri for security check. Their luggage, as usual, would go through
