NEW DELHI:   Students’ Union on Wednesday met the university vice-chancellor and put forward its demands of seeking revocation on the suspension of 11 students and an inquiry against the teachers for alleged misconduct in the last   meeting.

 They also urged the VC to not implement the UGC notification in 2017 and to stop sending threat notices to the students’ union. “We had to explain to him that the varsity is run by its students, teachers and workers. He cannot impose his rules on us. We also told him that protest is a way of functioning in JNU, and he cannot treat protesting students like criminals,” said  , president of JNU Students’ Union.
 
 He added that the administration projects the students’ union as a group that only resorts to protest. “We wanted to talk it out with him. He keeps sending us threat notices for everything. This was our way for finding a middle ground. But if he threats continue, we will have to resort to protest,” said Pandey.
 
 The   president said that the VC has agreed to look into the demands of the students’ union. Separately, a notice was sent to all the suspended students and an activist who protested during the Academic Council meeting on December 27, to appear before the chief proctor on Monday, and bring evidence in their defence, if any.
