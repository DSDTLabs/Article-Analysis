In the latest episode of Bigg Boss Marathi, the housemates celebrated Megha’s birthday.

 The episode started with the continuation of the 'Murder mystery' task. According to the task, the murderer had to kill the common man in the house.   was the first one to be murdered. He had killed Pushkar in the previous episode.
 
 The murder had to be done secretly by mixing salt in in the food, hiding someone’s family photo etc.
 
 Smita was the detective. Suspecting   to be a murderer, she interrogated her.
 
 Bigg Boss then called Aastad and asked him to murder the second person.
 
 Sushant was the second detective in the game. Pushkar told Sushant that he doubted Aastad.
 
 Aastad was seen stating (facing the camera) that he would kill Harshada by asking her to feed him. But Harshada denied it.
 
 Bigg Boss then called Aastad and told him that the task was over for the day but he should not inform this to the co-players participating in the task.
 
 It was Megha’s Birthday on the next day, so at midnight, Bigg Boss sent a cake given by Megha’s family. Everyone in the house enjoyed the celebration and wished her.
 
 Next day, the task continued. Aastad planned to kill someone by mixing salt in the food. Unknowingly, Resham consumed it and was declared dead.
 
 Then Bigg Boss called Megha in the confession room and gave her the birthday gifts sent by her family. Bigg Boss also informed her that she will be the second murderer in the task along with Aastad.
 
 Megha killed Bhushan first by sprinkling water on his face.
 
 She then murdered Jui by hiding her family photo.
 
 The last murder was of Harshada’s. Megha cut the apples and asked Harshada to feed her. Thus, she was killed.
 
 So the upcoming episode will decide whether the murderers get caught by the detectives or not.
