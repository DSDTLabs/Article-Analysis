 Crime Branch’s submission was in response to a petition filed by TG Mohandas of Koovapadom seeking an effective probe into the case registered in 2013. The case was registered by Ernakulam Central police station on a petition filed by Mohandas to a magistrate court and the probe was handed over to crime branch in February last year.
 
 There was no interference in the investigation at any point of time and the apprehension of the petitioner regarding the same is baseless, crime branch said. An effective and meaningful investigation is conducted by the agency to bring out the truth, the affidavit said.
 
 As per the complaint, Madani had conspired to kill Parameswaran and Fr. Alavi, a Muslim who converted to Christianity, and that several attempts were made since 1996. AV George, who was the investigating officer in a Marad case had deposed before the judicial inquiry commission that a PDP worker named AT Muhammed Ashraf, who was arrested in connection with the case, had confessed that Madani had sent him for ISI training in Pakistan via Sri Lanka through Bangkok but was sent back by Bangkok immigration authorities as his passport was forged. As per the police officer’s deposition, the inquiry commission had collected statement of K Mohammed alias Kadala Mohammed, who was the prominent witness in the case.
 
 In September 2015, Crime Branch had submitted to the court that no evidence could be obtained to substantiate the allegation that PDP leader Abdul Nasser Madani had conspired to kill P Parameswaran.
