 The 'Heart Wants What It Wants' hit maker checked herself into rehab last year to address her mental   issues, which have become a huge problem since she was diagnosed with auto-immune disease Lupus in 2015. 
 "Trust me, it's a daily struggle,"   says of her ongoing anxiety and depression treatment. 
 
  
  
 "Balance is the key. Patience. Being kind to yourself. Having grace. I think that's important." The 24-year-old Latina relies on the loved ones in her life for support, but she also surprisingly finds confidence and strength for her health pursuits in people who antagonise her.
