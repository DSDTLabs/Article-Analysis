THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has notified all   with population of over 10,000 as panchayats with the nature of municipalities on the basis of the latest   order giving states the liberty to permit the functioning of   in areas with the nature of municipalities. This will enable functioning of liquor outlets within 500 metres of the state and   in these panchayats.

 
 The order, issued by the taxes department on Friday after high-level discussions, will pave way to immediate reopening of two bar hotels (FL-3), 142 beer and wine parlours (FL-11) and 500 toddy shops.
 
 The government also clarified that bar licences can be issued in tourist zones certified by either the tourism department or taxes department.   sources said most of the 142 beer and wine parlours had already been upgraded to the level of 3-star hotels or above.
 
 The state government had moved the Supreme Court along with other states for exemption from the distance restriction, citing its geographical and demographic peculiarities. It had highlighted its high population density, criss-crossing highways, forest cover and water bodies to claim exemption.
