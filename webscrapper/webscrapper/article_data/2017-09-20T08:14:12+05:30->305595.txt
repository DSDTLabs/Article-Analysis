KOLKATA:   curator   seemed resigned to fate as he sat outside the ground with a blank look. The sky was overcast from early morning. The clouds built up gradually and once the skies opened up around 11 am, there was to be no respite. A spell of heavy showers was followed by a nagging drizzle, giving him no chance to take off the covers on Tuesday. 

 Asked if the ground will be ready for Thursday's second ODI between India and Australia, Chakraborty looked skyward. “Nothing is in our hands,” was all that he could mutter.
 
 The Australians turned up at the ground in the morning, but it started raining heavily soon after they reached Eden. The Indians were scheduled to practise in the afternoon, but so persistent was the rain that the management didn't take long in cancelling their session. The Men in Blue did not even venture out of the hotel. Steve Smith and his men, though, decided to train at the Pankaj Gupta Indoor facility since they had taken the trouble to drive to Eden.
 
 The visitors had prepared for Yuzvendra Chahal and   by having KK Jiyas, a chinaman from Kerala, bowl to them in the nets at Chennai. That hardly helped as the Aussies fell prey to the Indian wrist spinners on Sunday. On Tuesday, they again invited two local chinaman bowlers at the indoor nets.
 
 Suburban club's Rupak Guha and Ashutosh Shibram of Engineers Club rolled their arms over as the Australian batsmen took turns to face them during the one-and-a-half hour session. Interestingly, opener   - who missed the first match due to an injury - joined practice on Tuesday. The Aussie bowlers, however, skipped the session and left early.
