THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Batting for social equality and woman empowerment, vice-president M   said here on Friday that development of a state would be incomplete if it did not reach all sections of the society. He was delivering the 24th Sree Chithira Thirunal memorial lecture organized by the Sree Chithira  . 

  The vice-president said there was a need to keep politics out of religion.   and hence it must not be made a tool of politics. Unfortunately, a section of politicians used religion to create divisions within the society for their own vested interests.
 
  He said any   must benefit the entire society and must not be restricted to a certain community.
 
 "From my experience as a politician for the past 47 years, it is not possible for any politician or a political party to take care of any one community. If the politician claims to be able to take care of a community, it must be understood that he has vested interests," the VP said.
 
 He further said people's representatives should ideally be elected on the basis of four Cs, which stood for character, calibre, capacity and conduct. Sadly, the trend these days was that politicians were elected as people's representatives on the basis of three Cs - caste, community and cash. Speaking about  , the last ruler of Travancore, he said the temple entry proclamation that he made in 1936 was a major plank of the country's freedom movement.
