NEW DELHI:   has said that some media reports “completely misreported” the recent order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal ( ) in a case related to the investment of $150 million in 2008 by GE/NBCU.

 “These media reports are quoting from a press release by the   which not just distorts the verdict, but outright lies about it. NDTV is appealing in the Delhi high court against the verdict,” an NDTV statement said.
 
 “We also reiterate that contrary to what the press release of the income tax department says, the ITAT has refused to accept the allegation of the I-T department that there was any money-laundering by NDTV or Dr   (this is clearly mentioned in para 103 of its judgment). In fact, in its order, ITAT specifically recognises that the funds invested were indeed from NBC, the verdict states ‘the money was from Universal Studios’ (a 100% subsidiary of NBC),” the statement said. The channel said any claims that charges of money-laundering had been accepted by the tribunal “are false and agenda-driven”.
 
 “Yet, the I-T department does not reveal this essential part of the order - and continues its malicious and motivated claim, now fours years old, that GE/NBCU were part of some laundering scheme. This is part of the overall propaganda to intimidate and harass NDTV.” “NDTV remains committed to fighting these false stories and plants which are an attack on the freedom of the press and are meant to intimidate the media into abandoning fair, objective journalism,” it said.
