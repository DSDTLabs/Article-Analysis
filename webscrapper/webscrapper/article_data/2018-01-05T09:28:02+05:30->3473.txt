MADURAI: The indefinite strike called by employee unions of the state transport corporation left many people stranded on Thursday as the crew started withdrawing buses from the road and started taking them back to depots. 

 In the evening, the crowd started swelling at the city bus terminals as angry passengers started running helter skelter to catch the last service leaving the bus terminals. Though the talks between the transport corporation and the state government were under way throughout the day, the strike caught the general public unawares. "All of a sudden, buses were seen without destination boards at Periyar bus stand and we were left in the lurch. I managed to catch hold of a packed autorickshaw to reach home," said A Devi, a housewife from Nagamalai Pudukottai.
 
 R Vasudevan, secretary of a CITU-affiliated transport federation of workers, said they wanted to announce the strike later in the night. "When news started leaking out in media, the strike started spontaneously with crew members taking away buses to their depots. Almost half of the buses returned to their depots by 7pm and the rest returned later at night," he said. Official sources at TNSTC, Madurai, said that transport minister   has announced the government's stand and employee unions, supporting the state government, like  's labour union wing,  , will carry out the work as usual. There will not be a big impact on bus movement on Friday, a transport official said.
