PATNA: The newly formed Bihar Ex-Servicemen Association (Officers) has demanded construction of war memorials in the districts from where at least ten people have been martyred.

 “These memorials should be built on the pattern of those in other states, including neighbouring Jharkhand, where war memorials have come up as a tribute to the martyrs,” said Col (retd) V K Singh on Thursday.
 
 According to him, the strength of Indian defence forces is about 1.14 million, while an equal number of personnel are there in the central paramilitary forces. “At least one soldier on duty becomes a martyr after every three days in the country due to the war-like situation on the border. They include at least 20 to 24 soldiers from Bihar every year,” he said.
 
 Singh quoted a survey to claim that Bihar after UP was the second biggest contributor of manpower to defence forces in the country. “The state government is fighting social evils like child marriages and dowry... It should also think about remarriage of martyrs’ widows as well as rehabilitation of their minor children in Bihar,” he said.
