Type 2   is considered to be a   disease, which means that it targets people whose daily habits are far from those considered to be healthy. This also means that by bringing about a change in lifestyle; the disease can be held off to some extent. While diabetes control through medication is now possible, doctors also recommend some amount of physical activity and dietary control in order to regulate blood sugar levels. But because it is easier to keep a check on diabetes with medication rather than lifestyle modification, most people prefer to stick to medication alone. However, recent research demonstrates that both lifestyle management and medication are the key to treating diabetes.

 One of the landmark trials on the impact of lifestyle versus medication was Diabetes Prevention Program ( ), which has significantly demonstrated that by intensive lifestyle modification we can prevent the development of diabetes from Pre-diabetes stage by almost 58%. This finding was true across all ethnic groups as well as in both men and women. Lifestyle changes worked particularly well for participants of age more than 60 years by reducing their risk of development of Diabetes by 71%. 
 
 The key message is 
 
 • To have the ideal weight and avoid obesity.
 • Aerobic Exercise at least 4-5 Days per week.
 • Non- aerobic exercise not more than two sessions per week. 
 • 30-40 min walk per day i.e. 150 min walk per week without a gap of more than 48hrs between two consecutive walks.
 
 In a clinical trial that included 98 adults with non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes, researchers assessed the impact of lifestyle intervention on blood glucose levels and necessity of medication. Participants were categorized into two groups: 34 patients in a standard care group and 64 patients in the lifestyle group. All subjects received the recommended medications according to the established standard. In addition, participants in the lifestyle group also received five to six training sessions per week that included aerobic and resistance training. Along with physical training, lifestyle participants also received dietary plans which were aimed at a body mass index (BMI) of 25. At the end of 12 months, test results showed that there was a greater decline in blood glucose levels following lifestyle intervention as compared to only medical treatment, indicating that medication along with physical activity and diet can potentially result in better control of diabetes. In addition, there was a greater reduction in the use of glucose-lowering medicines in the patients from the lifestyle group, which indicates that lifestyle changes may actually reduce the need for medication based control of diabetes.
 
 Thanks to technology, we may have the option of popping a pill whenever required; but physical activity and nutrition are still the best methods to hold diseases like diabetes at bay.
