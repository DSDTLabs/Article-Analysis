 Ram Gopal Varma may have apologised to Megastar Chiranjeevi for ridiculing the title of his upcoming film ‘Khaidi No 150’, but it looks like all has been forgotten. The filmmaker, who has never shied away from making controversial statements, hit out at the star once again, this time it is because of the film's poster. 
 
The makers of the action film released a new poster that showed Chiru sitting on a trunk with a machete in his hand. RGV seems to have taken a particular dislike towards this poster and made sure to let everyone know about the same saying, "Wowwww Madame Tussaud will throw half her museum out for this ..Want to touch feet of designer and director and who convinced mega star. This is the upper limit of the height of narcissm and the lower limit of the depth of its opposite. Wilhelm Hegel would have kissed Mega Star." 
 
Ram continued the litany of insults as he added, "Can I please have the name, number and address of the designer and others around Mega Star who convinced him to put out a pose like this. Designer of this look is going to have a page forever in the annals of history for involuntary perpetuation and voluntary disorientation." 
 
 
 
It remains to be seen how Chiranjeevi fans will respond to these regular attacks on their beloved star’s comeback movie.
