Akarsh Khurana’s comedy, 'High Jack' stars Sumeet Vyas, Sonnalli Seygall and Mantra. This album of seven original songs includes two reprised versions, and is dominated by electronic dance music all through. If you are an EDM fan, this album should be played on a constant loop!
 
 The first track ‘Behka’ is all Nucleya — with his trademark catch beats and bass; singer   has also done a good job on it. This typical EDM might just go on to be a party staple. 
 
 ‘Kripya Dhyaan De’, composed, written and sung by Slow Cheeta and  , is a fast-paced, catchy track that is predominantly about psychedelic music. 
 
 The next track, ‘Aapaatkaaleen’ has been sung by Lisha Bajaj and Mantra and penned by Akarsh. The track talks about pre-flight instructions, and the trippy EDM has bass drops and catchy beats.
 
 Composer Anurag Saikia’s ‘Prabhu Ji’ penned by Akarsh has two versions, one sung by   and the other, by Suvarna Tiwari. This track begins like a devotional song and is a fine example of a not-so-common fusion between Hindustani classical and EDM. 
 
 Happy Ending composed by Rajat Tiwari also has twin versions — one. a duet by   and the other, with Manasi Mulherkar. This is a fun song and the lyrics take the cake — ‘Electronic music kafi sun liya, isiliye acoustic bajana hai... and ‘Moral Police to khush rakhke, Censor se film ko bachana hai...’
 
 If funky, trippy songs are your kinda music, then this is one album you must not ignore.
