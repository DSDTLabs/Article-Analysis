PUNE: The state   recently stopped the   release for   from the   dam after discharging about 3 TMC water.

 The water release continued for more than a month. The department said the water release was stopped after the demand for water for winter crops was fulfilled.
 
 The irrigation department releases water for winter crops twice every year. This year, about 6 TMC to 7 TMC water was released in two phases.
 
 Officials stated the collective water stock in the four dams in the Khadakwasla irrigation circle reached 15.45 TMC at the end of two rotations. This stock was almost 2 TMC more than the last year’s storage of 13.59 TMC.
 
 A meeting is now expected after March 15 under the chairmanship of district guardian minister or water resources minister to decide on the water release for summer crops.
 
 The city requires about 1.4 TMC of water every month. As of now, the civic administration has not planned any water cut, considering the adequate water stock in the dams.
 
 A senior irrigation department official said, “Enough water will be in reserve to meet the city’s requirements till July 15. Water from the remaining stock will be released for summer crops.”
