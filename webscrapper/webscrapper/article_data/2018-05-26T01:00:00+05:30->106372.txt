PATNA: Members of the Bharatiya   Vaish Mahasabha on Friday demanded more representation for Rauniyar community in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

 Former DG-cum-CMD of Bihar Police Building Construction Corporation Ashok Kumar Gupta, who was elected new national president of the Mahasabha, said the community felt demoralized due to poor representation in Parliament.
 
 “We will carry out a census to ascertain the actual number of people from community living in the state. The population of Rauniyar community is more than 1 crore in the country. However, the community does not have any MP in either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha,” Gupta added.
