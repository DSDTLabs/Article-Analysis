CHANDIGARH: Acting on a tip-off received from customers, the UT excise and taxation department on Friday conducted raids on two outlets of a Sector 8-based   for alleged   and seized documents.

 The department had received complaints about the outlet not issuing proper bills. A team led by Mandeep Kaur raided the   outlet while another team under SS Bedi cracked down on their Sector 35 branch.
 
 Sharing details of the incident, assistant excise and taxation commissioner RK Chaudhary said that the beauty parlour had not been issuing proper bills to customers, adding that they have seized some documents for verification.
 
 The department has also shortlisted traders whose shops and showrooms would be searched soon as there are confirmed reports of tax evasion.
