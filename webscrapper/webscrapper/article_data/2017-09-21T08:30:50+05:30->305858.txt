KRISHNAGIRI: A team of archaeologists has discovered more than 300 dolmens reportedly dating back to 3,000 years near   here on Wednesday. They said it was for the first time such a large number of dolmens was discovered from a single place in Krishnagiri region.

 A dolmen is a type of single-chamber megalithic tomb, usually consisting of two or more vertical megaliths supporting a large flat horizontal capstone. There are, however, more complex variants.
 
 The dolmens were found amidst a heap of stones atop the ‘Moral rock hillock’ in Mallasandram. “The exact age of the dolmens can be ascertained only after lab tests. Most dolmens are in a damaged condition. Some of them were eroded over the years, while others were damaged by miscreants,” said Aram A Krishnan, president of   (AHRC).
 
 Talking to TOI, he said all the dolmens had drawings on one side. Krishnan said his team has sent a few samples of the stones for lab test.
 
 Pointing out that some dolmens were big, the team said head of the village might have been buried inside them. 
 
 The archaeologists also urged the state government and the   to take steps to preserve the dolmens.
 
 People have damaged some dolmens while searching for precious metals such as gold and silver. “It is believed that ancient people buried the dead in the dolmen with all the items they used. We should take steps to preserve the dolmens as they tell ancient history to younger generations,” Krishnan added.
