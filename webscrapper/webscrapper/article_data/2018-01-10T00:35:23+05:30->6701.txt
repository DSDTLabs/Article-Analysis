Coimbatore: The crime branch-CID investigating the murder of Hindu Munnani spokesperson C Sasikumar have launched an inquiry into the role of Khani, a resident of Rathinapuri, who died of cardiac arrest a few months ago. Mubarak, the prime suspect in the case, who was arrested two weeks ago from Pollachi, had told the sleuths that Khani was present at the murder spot. “According to Mubarak, Khani was riding the motorcycle on which he was riding pillion to reach the spot. Later, Mubarak discarded a sickle used for the murder in a garbage bin at Rathinapuri,” an officer said. “We are trying to establish the role of Khani in the murder, but also suspect that Mubarak is trying to scuttle the investigation,” the officer said. Police have seized two motorcycles allegedly used for the murder from Mubarak. Thirty-six-year-old Sasikumar was hacked to death by a four-member gang at Subramaniyampalayam on September 22, 2016. Police soon arrested Syed Abudhakir of KK Nagar in Saibaba Colony, who was a close friend of the murder suspects. They later arrested S Saddam Hussain and S Zubair of GM Nagar in Ukkadam.  Police also seized a sickle used for the murder from Zubair.  The investigation revealed that Mubarak was the mastermind behind the murder. Khani was absconding.
