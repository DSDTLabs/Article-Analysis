MUMBAI: After a long time, a fresh new talent seems to appearing on the hockey scene in the country.   Singh, 21, made heads turn and tongues wag in appreciation during the 13th edition of the Guru Tegh Bahadur Gold Cup All India hockey tournament being played at the   (MHAL) turf at Churchgate.

  ( ) have acquired the services of Sukhjeet as a guest player and he did more than just enough to deserve a mention from his manager and former India goalkeeper  .
 
 "He is a bright prospect. He should be in the national camp in Bengaluru right now.But, because there is a core group in place, I think he has missed out. But he has age on his side and I am sure in the near future he will get a national call-up," Chauhan told TOI after IOCL defeated   6-3 to finish on top of Pool 'B'.
 
 Sukhjeet honed his skills in an academy in Mohali for about seven years. As he grew older, his talent spoke about him and soon there was a beeline of top teams waiting to woo him.
 
 "When Indian Oil invited me to play as a guest player, I gleefully accepted the offer," Sukhjeet, who scored three goals in Army XI's rout on Friday, said.
 
 For Sukhjeet it is his first tournament in Mumbai. But, even as he is scorching the field with his skills, the weather in Mumbai is scorching him. "The evening (4.30pm) matches are fine but playing at 2.30 is very harsh. It just completely drains us (players) out. Other than that I am enjoying the stint here," he said.
 
 Sukhjeet has already scored six goals in the tournament and he is looking good for more. The way he is going about strutting his stuff, it wouldn't be a surprise if he walks away with the honour of best forward or perhaps an emerging player award.
