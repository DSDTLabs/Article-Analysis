It’s just four days to go for   and Anushka Sharma’s romantic outing, ' '. Over the last two months, the film’s team has brought out content, which looks colourful and breezy, in a manner that has left the audience curious about what this love story really entails. Shah Rukh plays the Punjabi munda Harry, a tour guide, and Anushka plays a Gujarati damsel, Sejal, in the   directorial that releases on August 4. 
The promotions began with a series of mini-trails that gave an insight into the characters of the lead pair and their interpersonal relationship, which develops in the course of their journey across Europe. The trailer and the songs, starting with the peppy ' ', the club track 'Beech Beech Mein', the groovy 'Butterfly', the insightful ' ' and the romantic 'Hawayein', have heightened audiences’ interest in the romantic drama. 
 
 The songs, playing high on music charts, is a testament to the variety in the film’s album. Talking about the popularity of the film’s music, Imtiaz says, “Every time Irshad (Kamil), Pritam and I work together on an album, we start off with nervousness, anticipation and a foreboding feeling that we might do a disastrous job and people will hate the music. It happened with 'Love Aaj Kal', 'Jab We Met' and this time too. By the time our music comes out, the three of us are so busy with the nitty-gritties that we forget to worry about the audience reaction. With 'Jab Harry Met Sejal', we’re still trying to register the audience reaction. It really hit me that 'Hawayein' was the fourth most popular video viewed online on the day it was launched. 'Radha' and 'Beech Beech Mein' have also become popular. 'Safar' and 'Butterfly' were liked more than our expectations. The feeling is overwhelming.”
