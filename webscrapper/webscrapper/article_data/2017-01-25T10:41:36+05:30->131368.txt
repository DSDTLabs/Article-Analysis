CUTTACK: A forest guard was injured while trying to tranquilize a wounded elephant in Athagarh forest division on Tuesday.

 Forest officials said the male elephant has sustained injuries on his leg as a tyre has got stuck to it for the past few days. The elephant was seen limping and its condition was not good. With a motive to provide medical aid to the pachyderm after tranquilizing him, a team of forest officials, tranquilizer experts and veterinary doctors had ventured into the forest. But on seeing the team, the elephant turned ferocious and starting attacking the team members. One of the forest guard,  , was injured. 
 
 "Thankfully, the elephant did not trample the forest guard. The elephant chased him and he fell on ground due to which he has sustained some injuries," said divisional forest officer(Athagarh division Arun Swain. 
 
 The DFO said they cannot treat the elephant without tranquilizing it. Looking at the elephant's fierce behaviour we cannot tranquilize it now. We will have to wait for one to two days to let the animal calm down. However, we will keep a tab on it movements," said Swain.
