MUMBAI: Within days after the Rs 11,300 crore PNB scam involving   and   was exposed, the Enforcement Directorate announced it seized diamonds, jewellery and gold worth 5,700 crore from their showrooms and properties. This figure, however, has been questioned by experts in the diamond industry, including jewellers and government-approved valuers, who said it is "bloated and far-fetched". 

 Even among the ED, one officer feared that the actual value could turn out to be far less than earlier estimated. But senior officers in the department were confident and said the final value will be more than Rs 5,700 crore. 
 
  "After a preliminary check, valuers said the price of diamonds could be more than mentioned in Nirav's company records. Most of these were seized from godowns and we believe that Nirav's companies categorised them according to their purchase value. Sale value of the diamond could be more than purchase value. Our experts are trying to ascertain their real value," said the ED source. 
 
  A jeweller from south Mumbai told TOI , "It is impossible to value this much jewellery in a day or two. The ED will have to go to a government-approved valuer and the process would take at least a month. " 
 
  "I have a basic doubt," said one of the largest diamond merchants of the country. "If Nirav Modi had goods worth 6,000 crore, do you think he would have been in such a financial crisis? This industry works on credit, and receivables are usually twice the value of stock in hand," he added .
