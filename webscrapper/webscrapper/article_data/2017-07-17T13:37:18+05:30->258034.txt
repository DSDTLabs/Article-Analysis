AHMEDABAD: After the potholes created by heavy rains on the runway of Sardar   International (SVPI) airport were filled up and surfaced on Saturday, the work for its maintenance continued on Sunday. This led to all domestic flights getting delayed.

As the runway was not ready for flight operations, by Sunday evening as many as 11 flights had been delayed. The delays ranged from 30 minutes to three hours, the sources said. 
 
 The damage to the runway could not be repaired on time due to the incessant rains that had lashed the city on Saturday, the sources said.
 
 “All the flights that got delayed on Sunday were because the runway was not in yet ready because of the ongoing maintenance work. We are yet to count the exact number of flights but all the flights were delayed because all operations at the airport were affected,” said manager of   “Generally, repair work is over by 3 pm every Sunday but this time the rain played the spoilsport. 
 
 The maintenance work could be completed only by 6 pm. Due to this, not a single flight was on time,” he said. On Saturday, the potholes on the SVPI runway had to be surfaced again just after 12 days. Earlier, potholes were found on the runway on July 3. This had led to suspension of flight operations at the airport.
