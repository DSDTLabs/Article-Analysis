 Residents and activists at Vellalore said that a similar fire had broken out even on Friday but the officials and workers put it out themselves. “On Saturday when the fire broke out, officials thought that they could handle it themselves but even after 8pm when they could not control the fire, watertenders were called to the spot. The fire broke out where the garbage is being dumped and levelled behind   in Vellalore,” said Daniel Jesudas, member of DMK party.
 
 This is the third reported fire at the dump yard, this year. “The civic body claims to process the waste. If waste is being processed, there should not be any fire accidents,” said activists in the area.
