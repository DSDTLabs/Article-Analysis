Nagpur: Speakers at programme ‘Samvidhan Sanvaad’ said people should not misuse power and position, and realize that it is their duty to spread awareness in society about their rights given to them by the Constitution of India. Bureaucrats and leaders should prioritize this issue and contribute towards the welfare of the society, they said.

 They were speaking on ‘Constitution of India: Equality of status and opportunity to citizens — today’s reality’ at NH Kumbhare Sabhagruh, Dr Ambedkar College, Deekshabhoomi, on Tuesday. The idea behind the event was to put light on the current scenario where people are still deprived of their basic fundamental rights and justice is delayed. 
 
 The event, held under the chairmanship of district judge PP Patil, was inaugurated by EZ Khobragade, founding president of Maharashtra Officers Forum.   Firdous Mirza and Smita Singalkar were the keynote speakers. 
 
 Commenting on the rally by Muslim women against triple talaq bill held on Tuesday, Mirza said, “They were hiding behind the doors, but have now hit the streets to speak up against the interference in their personal laws. This clearly indicates that there is some flaw in delivering justice and maintaining equality.” 
 
 Mirza said, “My ancestors had a chance to choose their country at the time of Partition and they preferred India. The foundation of Pakistan was laid on the grounds of religion while the Indian Constitution entailed virtues of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. But somehow these principles are being forgotten which has given rise to social evils.” 
 
 Gender-based inequality is very common in India, said Singalkar, adding, “Our age-old customs and traditions push women to observe fasts on various occasions for safety and longevity of their husbands. Men should also put in efforts for women.” Seeds of gender equality should be sowed in young minds from school days, she added.
