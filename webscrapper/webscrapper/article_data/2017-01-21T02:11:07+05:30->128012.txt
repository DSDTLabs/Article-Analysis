NOIDA: Thse   in Noida — Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) — has been facing a severe cash crunch.   members alleged the crisis was a result of the Noida Authority’s stopping funding of the organisation four months ago over allegations of misappropriation of funds.

 While SPCA has an average monthly expenditure of Rs 18 lakh, it receives Rs 10 lakh every month from the Noida Authority. The   also gives an additional amount of Rs 1,400 per animal to carry out sterilisation. The shelter has around 1,000 animals and the members say they are unable to discharge their duties, including carrying out sterilisation or buying food and medicines for the animals, for lack of funds. Members have even warned that they may be compelled to close down operations if funding is not resumed soon.
 
 However, the Noida Authority said several complaints on the functioning of the organisation have come to the fore. “I have called for a meeting with its members on January 27 to sort out the matter before sanctioning any more funds to the organisation,” said Deepak Agarwal, CEO, Noida Authority. 
 
 Agarwal said the Noida Authority may conduct regular audits to ensure that funds are used optimally. “Over the past few years, there has been no audit for the funds given to the SPCA.. We might soon conduct a quarterly audit. Funds will be released after all issues are resolved,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, SPCA members said they never objected to scrutiny. “We are open to investigation and scrutiny. But to halt funding is unfair,”  , member, managing committee, SPCA, said.
 
 Stressing that it is an uphill task for the organisation to discharge duties amid lack of funds, Anjali Sharma, another SPCA member, said, “We have a credit of Rs 61 lakh already and senior members have not been paid salaries for more than a year now.”
