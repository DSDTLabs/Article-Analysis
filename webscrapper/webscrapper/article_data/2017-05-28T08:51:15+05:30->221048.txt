AMRITSAR: A day after the death of ‘supercop’  , the   (WSO) of Canada has called for a full commission of inquiry into the alleged human rights abuses, which according to it, took place in Punjab in the 1980s and 1990s.

 President of the WSO Mukhbir Singh told TOI on Saturday that, “Human rights abuses in Punjab during the 1980s and 1990s have not been adequately investigated or addressed. Gill was accused of human rights abuses, including the murder of   Khalra. His death means that we will never know the full extent of his involvement in these crimes.”

 Talking about the recent revelation of Punjab chief minister   that he got 21 terrorists surrendered who were later murdered, Mukhbir said that, “We believe it is essential that a commission of inquiry be established to investigate the abuses that occurred throughout Punjab. Police and administrative officials guilty of such serious crimes against humanity must be held accountable. Healing is impossible without accountability and justice.”
 
 He alleged that several prominent Punjab Police officers, including inspector   Pinky, former DGP S S Virk and sub-inspector Surjit Singh, have come forward with shocking admissions of torture, fake encounters and illegal cremations of bodies, naming several current senior police officials. “None of these allegations had been investigated,” he maintained.
