Ahmedabad: Gujarat University (GU) will not file a police complaint against a BCom student who wrote expletives in his semester 1 statistics exam answersheet. GU authorities said that the case will rather be put before its examination reform committee (ERC).

 Earlier, GU had declared that students involved in illegal or unethical activity in the exams will be liable for stern legal action with a police complaint. However, sources in GU said that the case of the BCom student will also be taken before the ERC. “A police complaint may prove harmful to the future of the student, so we will hear his case at ERC and further actions will be decided after he appears before the committee,” said a source.
 
 Sources in GU said a similar case was reported at the university three years ago, when a student wrote expletives in the answersheet and submitted it. The results for all subjects were cancelled for an entire semester in that case, said a source. tnn
