Nagpur: In a rare case, the sessions court had granted anticipatory bail of four days to 52-year-old accused Prashant Napade under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act on May 2. However, since Napade didn’t appear before the court on Friday, the court, after going through the medical evidence, cancelled his bail.

 Napade had raped a neighbour’s 4-year-old daughter after luring her with flowers to his place on April 26. He is absconding along with his family since the offence was registered at Kotwali police station on May 30.
 
 The victim’s family had been shocked when they came to know the accused had got anticipatory bail. The family told TOI, “We had been threatened by some locals that if we file a complaint, the rape accused would probably commit suicide. Earlier, in this locality, a middle-aged man had ended his life after a 3-year-old boy was killed during NMC work at an apartment in November last year.” 
 
 So, the cops had first questioned the accused regarding the incident, and he denied it. However, the survivor had identified him. When TOI visited the survivor’s house, she was still fearful and suffering severe pain in stomach. It is said the survivor had been sexually exploited by the accused earlier too.
 
 Newly joined zone-III DCP Rahul Manikkar said cops had no clue regarding the anticipatory bail. They too were shocked when they heard about it. Cops are tryig to trace his location and also searching his relatives’ homes. The phone of the accused is switched off, said senior PI KV Tijare.
 
 Cops would file a charge sheet within 30 days, added the DCP.
