These scenes underline the bond between children and parents. With our society becoming more open, these relationships have also evolved beautifully.” Vivaan, on his part, adds, “The generation gap is fast diminishing. I respect my father (actor  ) but he’s also my friend and we bond over movies, music and books. Our relationship has another dimension.”
