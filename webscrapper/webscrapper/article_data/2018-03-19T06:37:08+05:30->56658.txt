KOLKATA: A day before Md Shami’s estranged wife   is set to appear before a Kolkata judicial magistrate to record her incamera statement, Kolkata Police along with   police on Sunday started their preliminary enquires in  .

 The police team, which is likely to question Shami by next week, is trying to gather corroborative evidence after Hasin alleged she was subjected to mental and physical trauma after marriage and survived an “attempt to rape”.
 
 Joint commissioner of police (crime)  , however, refused to divulge details. “The team will be in Amroha till completion of the enquiry,” he said. According to police sources, a part of Hasin’s complaint (now registered as an FIR with non-bailable penal sections like rape and attempt to murder) deals with the time she spent in Amroha in December 2017. The couple was married in 2014.
 
 The investigators spoke to the neighbours and relatives. “We want to ascertain if anyone is aware of the events in December 2017 mentioned in the FIR; and whether there is any reference to these, in either a local police station or a court,” a source said. “Only after gathering more details, we will question the families,” the source added.
 
 According to some sources, people claiming proximity to the beleaguered Indian pacer have contacted a senior Kolkata-based lawyer for legal counsel. The senior lawyer reportedly advised against moving the   with a plea to quash the FIR under section 482 CrPC.
 
 “It is unlikely the HC will entertain such a plea given the charges made. Moreover, this is also a preliminary stage in the probe,” the lawyer reportedly advised. This, sources said, has left Shami with an option to apply for anticipatory bail given the nonbailable charges against him.
