Abhishek Bachchan,   and   have already begun working on Anurag Kashyap’s ' '. Now, Abhishek has shared an interesting and funny incident that took place recently.

  
  
 After wrapping up a day's work in Amritsar, Anurag apparently suggested that team have a ‘quiet meal’ at a dhaba. However, as the video shared by Abhishek will prove, it was anything but quiet. Taking to Instagram, the actor shared a short video of his team sitting in a dhaba as hundreds of fans thronged around them and can be heard shouting and cheering. Anurag can be seen smiling at the silly situation even as Abhishek sarcastically says, “Enjoy your meal.”
 
 Abhishek captioned the post as, “When your Director suggests "let's have a quiet meal at a dhaba". #WellThatWasntGoingToHappen #Manmarziyaan @anuragkashyap10.”
