VIJAYAWADA: In a bid to boost  , the state government is planning to set up   and organise   shows in Vijayawada. Tourism officials on Friday said they have roped in  , professional sea lion trainers from Turkey, for their river tourism venture.

  Principal secretary of tourism   said they have allotted 10 acres at Bhavani Island for the experiential tourism activity. Officials said they have seen the sea lion performance and described it as a ‘marvellous’ experience. 
 
 Sea lions, which are named after their loud roars, barks, and honks, are popular across the global tourism circuit. The intelligent mammals are known to demonstrate a variety of impressive behaviours and tricks.
 
 The entire project will cost Rs 10 crore. “Our main idea is to make tourists stay in Vijayawada for at least two to three days. Hence, we are looking at experiential tourism activities,” Meena said.
 
 Further the tourism department has released tenders for manufacturing house boats in the city. As of now, on a pilot basis, the tourism department will sail five house boats in the Krishna River.
 
 Meena observed that after the announcement of the capital region, there has been an increase in tourist footfalls. “There have been several conferences and professional events taking place in the city and it is natural that Amaravati has an effect on the tourist footfall. Going forward, this trend will continue to increase in the future,” Meena observed.
 
 Already, the tourism department is trying to go for more experiential tourism rather than creating destinations. They are also bringing in musical fountains and 3D projection mapping shows in Bhavani Island. 
 
 Officials said Bhavani Island will soon become an entertainment hub and a major weekend getaway spot for Vijayawadites. Meena said sea lion performance centre in Bhavani Island will materialise in two or three months.
