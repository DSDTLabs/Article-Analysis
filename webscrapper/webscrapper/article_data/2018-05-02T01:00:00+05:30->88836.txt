 Apart from a five day patch work schedule in Madhya Pradesh, Kangana will also shoot a promotional track for the film. “Right now, we’re not sure whether we’ll retain two promotional numbers or go with just one. The track we’re currently working on is entertaining and inspirational in nature. It matches the tone of the narrative. We’re hoping to finalise the lyrics, music and other details soon,” says a source close to the project. 
 
 We reached out to the film’s co-producer   but he remained unavailable for comment.
