The buzz in the industry is that   might be directing actor Sivakarthikeyan’s next. We hear that   has opted out of Sivakarthikeyan’s next. According to Vignesh, the script would take a long time and that the actor has to begin his work on his next.   Shivn seems to have opted out as he needs more time to finish the script. The actor, we hear, has already given the dates for the production house. Rajesh had previously penned dialogues for Sivakarthikeyan’s super hit film ‘Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam’. However, there is no official confirmation on the same. The confirmation is expected to happen after ongoing strike in the industry is called off.
