Noida: Having failed to get funds from Noida Authority to implement a one-year-old revamp proposal, the district forest office claims to have finally received support from Union minister for culture and environment, Mahesh Sharma, who has come forward to help support the beautification of the   as per the department’s existing plan. According to officials, the sanctuary could be fully revamped by December 2018.

 The original plan submitted to the Noida Authority by district forest officer HV Girish had allotted budget for cameras, gates, library, washrooms, drinking water facility, bird education among others to help convert the Okhla bird sanctuary into a well-managed one which would serve as an educational centre on birds as well. The initial estimated cost for the project was Rs 25 crore.
 
 “The funds we were expecting from Noida Authority were not released, but now the member of parliament from Noida, Mahesh Sharma, himself has come forward to support. He has assured us that the funds necessary for the upgradation will be organized. We are expecting the entire overhaul to be complete by December. We have already held three meetings over this,” DFO, Gautam Budh Nagar, HV Girish, said.
 
 According to the DFO, the issue of Okhla bird sanctuary is expected to be taken up for discussion on March 1 at the environment ministry.
 
 The sanctuary has for a long time lacked facilities with a lack of surveillance reported frequently. While the forest department has strengthened security at the gates and a ticketing service has been introduced, the bird-park, despite having a sanctuary status shows lags behind.
 
 “Despite the repair work of the gates this year, the count of bird visit to the park was decent and even now those migratory birds which arrived late in the season are present in the park. So the park is going to thrive. We are hopeful that by the end of 2018, it will be a refurbished sanctuary,” Girish added.
