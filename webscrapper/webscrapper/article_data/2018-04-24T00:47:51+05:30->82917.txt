Chennai: After triggering speculation of electoral tie-up with BJP,   on Monday disowned an article in its party mouthpiece   that said the ruling party and   should function as double-barelled gun. Lok Sabha deputy speaker M Thambidurai said there was no such   and the party was acting on its own. “The alliance formation will be decided by the leadership during election time,” he said.

 Namadhu Amma is set to carry a rejoinder in its Tuesday edition, to clarify that the article by a contributor A Thirumalai talked about the “cordial relationship” between the governments and not the parties. Thambidurai said former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had maintained individuality in running the party and it would continue to do so. 
 
 “We function as a separate party in Parliament and there is no alliance. There is no double-barelled gun now… where is it? The report is wrong,” he said. Fisheries minister D Jayakumar said alliances are not decided by columnists.
 
 Namadhu MGR editor Marudhu Alaguraj said he was abroad when the article was published. 
 
 “The management will take action against two staff members, responsible for it,” he told TOI.
