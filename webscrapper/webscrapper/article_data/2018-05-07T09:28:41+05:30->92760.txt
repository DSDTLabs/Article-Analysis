CHANDIGARH:   chief minister   said on Sunday that they had urged Punjab government to join hands in checking the wasteful flow of   waters to Pakistan, keeping in view the unprecedented water crisis that looms large before both states.

 Khattar was addressing mediapersons ahead of his foreign tour. He said that he had written a letter to his Punjab counterpart   to direct his officers concerned to take up the proposal in the right earnest. “You must have noticed reports about an unprecedented water crisis that looms large before our states. More and more blocks of Haryana and Punjab have anyway been slipping into the category of over-exploited blocks even as our hardworking farmers toil in the face of a farm sector under stress. I think that time has come when we must join hands in checking the wasteful flow of Ravi waters to Pakistan,” the letter read.
 
 “You may perhaps be aware that the sixth meeting of the committee formed by the government of India in this regard was held at the Central Water Commission, New Delhi on April 23, 2012. It had assessed the quantum of minimum utilizable water (MUW) as 32 cumecs (equivalent to 0.58MAF) on a sustainable basis. The committee had decided on a proposal of its diversion by constructing a 2-2.5m high diversion weir structure across the Ravi with a gravity flow canal off-taking from Dharamkot to Harike headworks was viable,” the letter further read.
 
 “It is indeed unfortunate that there has been no visible progress on the issue so far and the ever so precious water is still going to Pakistan. This enormous national wastage of water needs to be stopped immediately,” it further said.
