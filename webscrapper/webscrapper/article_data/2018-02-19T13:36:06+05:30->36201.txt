ONGOLE: In a curious twist to the ongoing political drama in the state, YSR   (YSRC) supremo YS Jaganmohan Reddy has expressed his willingness to move no-trust motion against the NDA government at the Centre if the Telugu Desam Party ( ) comes forward to support it.

 Responding to Jana Sena leader   Kalyan’s suggestion,   said that his party is ready to back the motion if TDP itself wants to move it in the Lok Sabha. He asked Pawan Kalyan to first prevail upon his friend and ally Chandrababu Naidu to move the no-trust motion against the NDA government.
 
 Addressing a public meeting at Kandukur, Jagan said that any political party requires at least 54 MPs to move the no-trust motion against the government in the Parliament. “Our party has just five MPs. Still, we are ready to move the motion if TDP supports it. We shall also support the motion if the TDP moves it. You please convince Naidu on the issue,” he demanded Pawan Kalyan.
 
  “We have already announced that our party MPs will quit Lok Sabha on April 6 if the Centre refuses to grant the Special Category Status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh. We have appealed to Naidu to join hands with them to fight for the state’s cause and achieve SCS by making all his party MPs to quit Lok Sabha,” Jagan said and pooh-poohed the study carried out by the   (JFC) constituted by Pawan Kalyan to champion the state’s cause. He said there is nothing that the JFC could unearth from its two-day-long session. He said Chandrababu Naidu himself had been telling people that the Centre had spared adequate funds to the state in the last four budgets but started resentment in the election year. He said that one can easily understand the political drama of Chandrababu Naidu except Pawan Kalyan. Instead of focussing on what the state had achieved from the Centre so far, Pawan should start working on achieving SCS to AP, Jagan suggested.
