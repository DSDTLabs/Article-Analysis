 Rajput may be currently busy with the promotions of his upcoming release, 'Raabta', with co-star  , but he has already made plans to unwind once he wraps up work commitments. The 31-year-old  , who recently became the proud owner of a spanking new Maserati Quattroporte, will be setting off on a road trip with a few close friends.

 A source close to the actor said, "Sushant plans to drive from Mumbai to Pune and beyond as it's been a while since he went on a road trip with his buddies. He's been telling people that it's almost like a dream for an actor who struggled to even travel by an auto rickshaw during his theatre days, to own a brand new luxury car. So far, he has only managed to take his car for a spin a couple of times, thanks to his tight schedule, so he has now planned this long trip, where he can drive to his heart's content."
 
  
  
 Sushant, when contacted, confirmed the news to Mirror, "Yes, I will be going on a road trip with my best friends, it's about time I've taken my car out for a long trip.

I have always been passionate about automobiles."
 
 After the much-deserved break, Sushant will head to National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( ) towards June-end as part of his prep for Sanjay Puran Singh Chauhan's space-adventure, 'Chanda Mama Door Ke', to undergo training in wearing a spacesuit, the moon walk and practicing flight simulations at the facility.
