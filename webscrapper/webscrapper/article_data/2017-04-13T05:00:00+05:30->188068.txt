For the past few days, the fear of a   ghost has scared the patients and their relatives thanks to a video that has gone viral. The video shows a stretcher moving at will in a hospital corridor near the morgue. And the moment an attendant tries to walk towards it, it starts moving in the opposite direction, while the man hurriedly walks away, with fear written all over his face. In this day and age, a   story basically belongs to children’s story books, but seeing the way it has created panic in the city, we asked the college authorities to clear the air.

 
 Reports claim that GMC patients are wary of passing anywhere near the morgue area, lest they encounter a poltergeist. Quite aware of the situation, dean of the institution,  , says, “GMC is a medical institution that works on scientific methods and there is no truth to the ghost propaganda that has been promoted on social media. But then GMC is the most vulnerable target and people get away with anything as far as we are concerned.”
 
 
 Completely negating the ghost story, the dean goes on to add, “I have seen the video; it is completely fake. In fact, it is a nasty prank played by mischief mongers. The corridor shown in the video doesn’t match with any place in the GMC. Nor does the hospital employee resemble any staff member of our hospital. Some of the people from medical fraternity have told me that earlier, a similar video had gone viral as Mumbai’s JJ hospital ghost video.”
 
 
 As the dean and hospital authorities are so sure about the online video being fake, why don’t they file a complaint with the cyber cell? Ask him this and Dr Niswade replies, “If I react to it, they will come up with something new to try and irritate us. So, what is the point? It is not possible to fight every prankster on social media. But I want to tell those who come to our hospital for treatment that they have no reason to get scared. There is no ghost at GMC at all.”
