HYDERABAD: Congress legislator Komatireddy Venkatreddy, who has been expelled from the Assembly, has demanded that electronic footage, if there is any, of what he purportedly threw at Council chairman   be made public.

 “There are many cameras in the Assembly. Why is there only one video of mine throwing papers being publicised? If what I threw really hit the Council chairman, that video should be brought out,” he told TOI at the   office on Tuesday.
 
 Sitting in the CLP office, the   legislator repeatedly watched television channels playing the video of him throwing papers in the Assembly. He wondered how this could prove that what he threw hit Swamy Goud.
 
 “Much as I respect him, I do not think he has been injured as it is being made out to be,” Komatireddy Venkatreddy told the media. He alleged that it was only a drama that was being enacted at the behest of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.
 
 Swamy Goud, who was hospitalized on Monday for an eye injury, is still in Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital for the second day. A stream of MLAs and ministers have been calling on him to enquire about his health.
 
 Congress legislator S A  , who was also expelled, chose not to speak about the issue and said the party would take a decision on the next step.
