GURGAON: After razing the encroachments coming in the way of the link between   expressway and NH-8, the Haryana Urban Development Authority ( ) is now shifting the high tension (HT) towers which are posing a hurdle for the alignment of the road.

 According to the authorities, the high tension towers of 220 kV line will be shifted by mid-February while the towers with 66 kV line will be shifted by mid-March. For this, the urban development authority has prepared a proposal of Rs 20 crore. The shifting is being carried out by Haryana Vidyut Prasharan Nigam limited (HVPNL) and financed by Huda.
 
 The HT towers are coming in the alignment of 18 km-long Dwarka expressway at five different places in between Kherki Daula to Dwarka. The location of these HT towers are near the Delhi-Gurgaon border, at Sector 102-102A, near the Basai railway-over-bridge (RoB), Kherki Daula junction towards Dwarka and near Gari Harsaru village near Sector 36 and 88. 
 
 The superintendent engineer of Huda, Arun Dhankar, told TOI that the shifting process has already begun and is going on at a fast pace. “We will complete shifting of 220 KV lines by 220 KV and 66 KV lines are expected to be shifted by March 31,” said Dhankar. 
 
 Meanwhile, the engineering wing of Huda is expected to start removing debris near Kherki Daula village to level the land in next few days and make this road motorable in next two weeks.
