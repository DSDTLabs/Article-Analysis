NEW DELHI: No person above 70 years of age, who owns single domestic property in east Delhi, will need to pay property taxes. 

 The final   presented in the house of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation ( ) on Tuesday announced 100%   for people above 70 owning single domestic property in personal use (not comemrcial) across all 64 wards of the corporation. People between 60 to 70 years of age have to pay only 75% of the   they have been paying for a long time — they were given a 25% rebate. The lucrative announcement might help BJP ruling the corporation earn votes, but it is likely to cause huge financial loss to the corporation on the verge of financial ruin.
 
 Leader of the house Sanjay Jain, who presented the budget, said: “The 100% tax break is for senior citizens who own only one property which is in his/her personal not in commercial use.” Area with highest population density in city, east Delhi civic limits house over 40 lakh people and property tax officials believe the announcement, if implemented, will cost the civic body a big financial loss. On the verge of financial ruin, EDMC will find it difficult to afford this populist tax break. A finance department official said the calculations of the implication of the tax break and how many people will benefit from it have not been made yet.
