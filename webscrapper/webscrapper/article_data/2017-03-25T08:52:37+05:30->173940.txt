JAIPUR: The auto rickshaws in the city ferrying school children continue to flout norms, risking the lives of several children. While the city police have launched a   to nab such offenders, the lack of enforcement has allowed drivers to cramp their vehicles with children.

 “Auto rickshaws are filled up with as many 12 children, sometimes students are made to sit at the edge of the auto seats which exposes them to traffic. Sometimes students fall from the vehicles which causes deadly injuries to them,” said a traffic official, adding that schools should also share responsibility to ensure that their students are not put to any harm.
 
 “Several times we have launched campaigns against these drivers, we have even asked schools to ban such notorious drivers but no action has been taken so far,” said the official, adding that schools themselves have failed to crack a whip on the minor drivers who come to school on bikes and in cars.
 
 “Many times we have seen school autos ferrying children as well as other passengers in the same auto, which is again a serious concern for all of us,” the cops said.
 
 Apart from cramped up vehicles, the   and van drivers also flout other safety norms like safety cage, not keeping first-aid box etc. “Last year when we carried out the drive in the month of March, we found that several auto rickshaws didn’t have safety cage and despite several reminders they didn’t keep first-aid boxes,” the police said.
 
 The parents told TOI that they have no other option but to rely on auto drivers as there is shortage of school buses, “The school vans charge way too much, and the school buses have pre-designated routes,” said Preeti Singh, a parent.
 
 The Jaipur police said that a new traffic campaign is afoot to book offenders, the cops in the morning and afternoon would be deployed at earmarked places.
