NEW DELHI: Hundreds of students and teachers from  ,  ,   and   assembled at   on Wednesday for a massive “People’s March” in defence of public-funded higher education to protest against the recent decision to grant   to a few institutes. The agitators alleged that it was an attempt by the government to initiate privatisation of these institutes.

 Lending his support, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said, “This fight is mine too as tomorrow I have to send my kids to college. If they make higher education expensive, only a few will have access to it.”
 
 Sisodia claimed that the Centre wants to destroy public education, like they had earlier “destroyed public schools in favour of private schools owned by a few business houses.”
 
 The march to Parliament Street saw over 2,000 students and teachers from several DU colleges like Dyal Singh, Jesus & Mary, SGTB Khalsa, Ramjas and others. JNUSU, DUSU and teachers associations like NDTF also joined the protest called by DU Teacher’s Association (DUTA) and FEDCUTA.
 
 Rajib Ray, DUTA president, said, “The march is against the government’s policy onslaught of financial autonomy, self-financing of courses, negative pay and service conditions of teachers and attack on reservation.”
 
 He was supported by senior CPM leader Brinda Karat who said that the government is experimenting on universities on how to end reservations.
 
 JNUSU president Geeta Kumari and DUSU president Rocky Tuseed also joined in the cry against the alleged attempts to make education “exclusive for the rich.”
 
 DUTA demanded that there should be 100% assured funding for all central and state universities and central assistance to cover the seventh pay commission revision for all teachers across the nation and the withdrawal of the autonomy regulation.
