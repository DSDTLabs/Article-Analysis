Vadodara: Two persons were arrested on Tuesday night for forcibly taking away car of their friend after threatening to kill him.

 Complainant Heyum Khan Pathan had taken a loan of Rs 5.21 lakh in name of the accused Sameer Darbar in 2016 to buy a car. Police said that Darbar had obliged then since both were friends. Later Pathan borrowed Rs 60,000 from Darbar for his sister’s operation. Pathan continued to pay the instalments of the car loan and the money to Darbar which he had borrowed until January this year. But, when his financial conditions deteriorated he could not repay money.
 
 Darbar, with his accomplice Moin Malek, who was also arrested along with him on Tuesday, started to threaten Pathan seeking repayment. Cops said that some weeks back, both Darbar and Malek went to Pathan’s house in Gorwa and threatened to kill him if he did not return the money. TNN
