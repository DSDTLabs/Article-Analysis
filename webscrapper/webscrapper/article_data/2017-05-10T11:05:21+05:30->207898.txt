Cuttack: The All India   Federation ( )   got hacked on Tuesday by a group that calls itself the “Zero Cool”.

 The hacking was identified in the evening when the Federation Cup match between Aizawl FC and Churchill Brothers was being played and the AIFF personnel were suddenly unable to update the reports on the website (the-aiff.com).
 
 Although there has been no confirmation, the language on the website sounded like it was the job of a Pakistani hacker. The hackers spoke of India’s demand for the release of  , the Indian national who had been arrested in Balochistan, and hurled abuses on India. The hackers also threatened to send back only Jadhav’s dead body. 
 
 “The website had been working even in the afternoon (on Tuesday). Right now, our IT department is looking into the matter,” an official from the AIFF media team here told the TOI. At the time of filing this report, the website had been closed down.
