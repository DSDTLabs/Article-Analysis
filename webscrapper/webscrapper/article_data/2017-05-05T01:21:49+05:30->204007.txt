NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party ( ) has approached the high court challenging the order of the   (LG) asking it to refund Rs 97 crore for money spent on  

 The party, in its plea, has sought quashing of the demand notice issued on March 30 by the Delhi government’s Department of Information and Publicity (DIP) on LG Anil Baijal’s direction to recover the amount.
 
 The LG had ordered the chief secretary of Delhi government to recover the amount from AAP within a month after a report of a Centre-appointed committee concluded that the Delhi government had splurged exchequer’s money on advertisements projecting chief minister   and his party, violating the Supreme Court’s guidelines.
 
 In its plea before  , the party has also sought setting aside of the findings of the three-member committee, headed by former chief election commissioner B B Tandon.
 
 The panel had been constituted by information and broadcasting ministry on directions of the apex court to address issues related to content regulation in government advertising. The committee’s order of September 16 last year had come on a complaint from Congress leader Ajay Maken who accused the AAP-led Delhi government of splurging public money on advertisements.
 
 In its report, the panel had also said that AAP should reimburse the expenditure for violation of the apex court’s May 13, 2015 order. Delhi government’s ad expense has also been the focus of a CAG report. Recently, the national auditor had found that the AAP government spent Rs 29 crore releasing advertisements outside Delhi, which was “beyond” its responsibility.
 
 It had also said that advertisements worth Rs 24 crore released by it were in violation of financial propriety and Supreme Court regulations.
