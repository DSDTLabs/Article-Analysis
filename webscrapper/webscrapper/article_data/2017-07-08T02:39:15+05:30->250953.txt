NEW DELHI: In the wake of rising number of   incidents, a group of lawyers, activists and student leaders has drafted a “legislation”—Manav Suraksha Kanoon ( )—which advocates stringent punishment for those involved in such cases and promises speedy justice for victims. Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of B R Ambedkar; entrepreneur Tehseen Poonawalla, student leader Shehla Rashid, among others, on Friday released, what they call, the draft law. 

 The exercise is the result of a country-wide campaign against lynching, launched on June 5. The draft law proposes to make lynching a non-bailable offence, calls for immediate suspension of the SHO of an area, where such an incident takes place, until probe gets over and life imprisonment for those convicted for lynching. It says videographic evidence of survivor’s statements should be considered as evidence, a time-bound judicial inquiry, which should not take more than six months besides creating provisions for compensation and rehabilitation for victim’s family.
 
 Lawyer  , who presented the draft law, said: “A special law against mob lynching is needed in line with the special law against domestic violence or atrocities on Dalits. IPC has provisions but the existing laws are not comprehensive. MASUKA is a comprehensive draft law and has provisions for judicial probe, witness protection and other provisions against lynching.” 
 
 Senior lawyers Sanjay Hegde and Rebecca John, DU professor Apoorvanand, professor Manoj Jha and actor Swara Bhaskar were also part of the drafting committee.
 
 “I firmly believe the government will pass ‘MASUKA’ and make this law a reality soon. We have received tremendous support from all sections of society,” said Tehseen Poonawalla.
