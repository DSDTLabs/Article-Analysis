NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Secondary Education ( ) has announced that from this year onwards only one set of question paper would be set for students taking the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET). 

 The   informed a Supreme Court bench comprising Justices Arun Mishra and F A Nazeer that earlier students were allowed to take NEET in 10 languages including Hindi and English.
 
 
 
 The apex court had earlier said that the practice of setting different sets of question papers in different languages is "illogical" and it would be "very difficult" to evaluate the competence of students when their questions are different.
 
 The court was not satisfied with the board's contention that if the level of difficulty of all papers was the same, then it served the purpose of uniformity in the examination and there was nothing wrong in having multiple sets of question papers.
 
 Agreeing to the suggestions of the apex court, the CBSE board said that from the present academic session, there would be only one question paper for NEET examination which would be translated into different languages.
 
 
 
 The NEET is an entrance test conducted nationwide for admission in MBBS and BDS courses across various colleges and universities in India. 
 
 The plea for one set of question paper for medical aspirants was filed by a 'Sankalp' charitable trust.
