There’s something always brewing on the   television front — both on screen and off it. The latest is that  , the lead actor of popular daily soap  , has opted out
 of it and another artiste   has stepped into his shoes. Shine, apparently, has left the show to pursue his
  cinematic dreams. For Chandu, the opportunity is a sign that providence is at work. “In fact, it was my dream to play this role as the on screen name of the lead character is named Chandu. It’s my real-life name, so
  playing a self-titled role has been a huge aspiration for me. I’m glad it’s come true,” shares Chandu. While he admits that he was sceptical about stepping into the shoes of Shine, who had played the character for over two years now, Chandu says that the encouraging response of fans on his social-networking page have debunked his fears. “Now I’m in it for the long haul,” he sums up.
  Not many people know, but Chandu and Shine are fast friends in real life. “And there’s absolutely no bitterness among us about his change of scene,” says Chandu.
