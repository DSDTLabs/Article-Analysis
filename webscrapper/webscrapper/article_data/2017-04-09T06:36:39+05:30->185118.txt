GANDHINAGAR: Taking a leaf out of the book of UP CM,  , Gujarat Congress, too, has promised it will waive around Rs 24,000 crore worth farm loans, if voted to power in   elections this year.

 Bharatsinh Solanki, state Congress president, said, “We will waive all farm loans and make farmers debt- free, if we come to power in the assembly elections. At present, there is around Rs 24,000 crore debt on farmers.”
 
 “In the last three years 1,483 farmers   in Gujarat due to bad policies of the state government,” Solanki alleged. 
 
 Jitu Vaghani, state BJP president said that Congress had always followed an anti-farmer policy. By halting the Narmada Dam project, Congress dealt tremendous damage to farmers, he said, adding that Congress has started making false promises in desperation. He added that in Gujarat, the BJP government, through various initiatives like Krishi Mahotsav and loans at 1% rate of interest, has boosted agriculture production.
