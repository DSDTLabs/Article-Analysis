 is one of the most prominent names of the Punjabi entertainment industry. The star has tried his hand in almost every domain, be it acting, singing, production or direction. Not just this, his cinematic contribution in all the forms have been lauded by the audience. However, recently, when the artist visited the capital city for promoting his upcoming movie ‘Carry On Jatta 2’, he also opened up about how he feels that   is the best version of him.

 
 Since every field brings the artists fame and money, they generally tend to dodge questions where they are asked to make a choice among their areas of work. On the other hand, when Gippy was asked that from singer, actor, writer and director, in which role does he like himself the most, he didn’t take much time to reply. He said, “I think I can be a good director. Though I have only directed one movie so far, I feel I can excel in the domain.”
 
 Talking about how he landed up in the field of direction, he said, “I was looking for directors for the movie ‘Ardaas' but nobody gave me a heads up. Everyone said it’s not a commercial film, nobody will see it. But I wanted the project to go on floors, so I donned the director’s cap. Also, I would like to make more films like ‘Ardaas’.”
 
 Though earlier, Gippy couldn’t find a director for his script, currently, he says he is just not looking for a director for his next. “I have another script in hand and I am not looking for a director. But it’s a big project, so first let’s see how much business ‘Carry On Jatta 2’ brings so that I get a clear picture of the market and box office.”, added the star.
