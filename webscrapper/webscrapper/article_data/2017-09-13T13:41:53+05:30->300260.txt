COLVA: The commercial capital of Goa, Margao, regularly experiences traffic congestion. The reasons for this are various, including increasing numbers of vehicles, lack of parking space, traffic violations, and poor public transport. However,   traffic cell personnel seem more interested in revenue generation than traffic regulation, collecting nearly Rs 50 lakh by way of fines till September. 

 Steven Carvalho from Fatorda, observing that small number of traffic police deployed at strategic points, including in the heart of the city that sees voluminous traffic, said, “This is one of the main reasons for traffic congestion in the city. The few traffic personnel present cannot handle the thousands of two and four wheelers entering and exiting the town.” 
 
 According to figures provided by traffic cell police inspector Mohan Gawde, 42,322 fines have been issued for various offences from January to August this year, and the traffic cell has collected Rs 48.95 lakh by way of the fines. However, traffic woes of the citizens of Margao do not seem to be on the decline.
 
 PI Gawde attributed the traffic jams to an increased number of vehicles and lack of parking space in the town. Although he concurred that the absence of traffic personnel in the town meant that people violated rules, the PI disclosed that he was short of 20 personnel as per the sanctioned strength.
 
 Ashley Fernandes, a resident of  , who has repeatedly complained about vehicles using the wrong road on a four-lane bypass in their attempt to approach a petrol station, said, “I have even written to the PMO’s office. I got an acknowledgement stating that directions have been issued to man the road, but nothing has happened.” He added that traffic police present at the spot are more interested in issuing fines to helmetless riders than stopping the nuisance. Many accidents have happened here due to this he said and added that the Road Safety Week being observed was just a farce.
