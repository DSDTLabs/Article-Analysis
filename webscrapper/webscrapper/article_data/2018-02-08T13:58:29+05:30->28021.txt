TRICHY: Demanding that the government deposit their educational loans and scholarships, more than 250 students belonging to the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe communities protested outside the district collectorate here on Wednesday.

 The students – all from   at   – claimed that they were supposed to receive both the loan and the scholarship by the end of December, but they were not deposited into their bank accounts till date.
 
 The protesters initially staged a road roko outside their college campus. Upon hearing about the incident, adi dravidar welfare department officer Mathivanan, tahsildar   and police personnel tried to pacify the students. Not convinced with their replies, the students headed to the collectorate to submit a petition to the collector. However, they were not allowed inside the office and sat outside and continued their protest.
 
 Later, district revenue officer (DRO) A   promised the students that they would receive both the loan and the scholarship within a fortnight, following which the students left the place.
 
  “We were supposed to receive both the loan and scholarship by December, but we didn’t. Later we were promised that we would be getting it by the end of January, which has also not happened,” one of the protesters said TOI.
 
  He added that the students would organise a bigger protest if they are not provided the benefits within a fortnight’s time.
