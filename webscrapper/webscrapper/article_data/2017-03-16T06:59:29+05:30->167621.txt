JAIPUR: The state government has done away with the no-detention policy for class VIII students by amending the  .

 The move, a first in the country, has got approval from the  , claims the state education department. The move will put into practice, says the department, although any such amendment requires a go-ahead from the President.
 
 The provision of the Act was undone by following a legislative route, which is legally sound, a senior gov ernment official told TOI.
 
 “No-detention policy has ruined the learning levels of students in primary and upper primary classes. We have done a course correction,“ state education minister   said. “Exams will be conducted for class V and VIII by the   (DIET). For class VIII students, if they score poorly they will have to sit in remedial classes for a month, af ter which they would take the exam again. If they fail the second time also, they will have to repeat the class,“ he said.
 
 Devnani has been against the no-detention policy ever since he assumed the post of education minister. In fact, he has headed the HRD committee on no-detention policy, and has been advocating scrapping of this provision under the RTE Act.
 
 “Comparative data of all states shows that learning outcomes have declined, especially with reading, comprehension and mathematics,“ Devnani said, adding that some other states could also follow suit as they have studied the model and expressed their willingness to do the same.
 
 The RTE Act was introduced during the second term of   government in 2009.
