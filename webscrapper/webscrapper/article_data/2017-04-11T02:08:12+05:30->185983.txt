NOIDA: The villagers of  , who received notices to appear in court over the violence that took place in the two villages six years ago over land acquisition, organised a   in front of the district collectorate in Surajpur on Monday, demanding withdrawal of criminal cases filed against them. 

 According to the villagers, so far 15 people have received summons to appear in the court on April 24.
 
 Jugal Kishore, a local resident, said that his son Raj Kumar (25) was named in the FIR in May 2011. “Following the clashes, he was arrested and put behind bars. He was released after serving in jail for one-and-a half months. Later we were told that he had no role in the violence and hence he was released. On Friday, we saw a notice pasted on our house, saying he needs to appear in court,” Kishore, a retired government teacher, said. He said that his son is in a state of shock and has stopped eating and talking to people ever since he received summons.
 
 Another resident,   Sharma (75), is also named in the FIR. Sharma said that following the violence, the police named a number of people without verifying the facts. “The police also arrested me and released after two months. What would a senior citizen do in clashes? The government should withdraw the cases and provide us relief,” Sharma said. A 30-year-old resident, on condition of anonymity, said that he was also named in the FIR. “At that time I had fled from the village. I thought that the matter has been resolved as it took place six years ago. Two days ago, I again received an arrest warrant from the district court. This has completely shattered me. I get frightened whenever I hear a police siren in the village. I do not sleep in my house at night fearing the police may come anytime,” he said.
