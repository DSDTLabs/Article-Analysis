PATNA: Property dealer   (56) was rescued by Patna police from the Maoist-infested jungles near   under the Govindpur police station area in Nawada district on Thursday night. Bhagat was kidnapped from Beur area in Patna on May 29 for Rs 20 lakh ransom.

 Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said the three kidnappers were identified as Rana Pratap Singh (58) of   in Gaya district, Alok Kumar of Kharagpur in   district and Ravindra Yadav from   village in Nawada. 
 
 The SSP said Bhagat, a resident of Makhdumpur under the Beur police station area, was called by Rana over the phone for some work. He said Bhagat deals in property in Patna, Kolkata, Delhi and some other cities.
 
 “Bhagat was taken to Patna Junction from where the two went to Rana’s residence at Kauwakol. From there, Bhagat was taken to the jungles of Sarkanda Khirki on Jharkhand border,” the SSP said, adding that Bhagat was kidnapped over financial dispute with Rana.
 
 The SSP said several calls were made on the cellphone of Bhagat’s son   (22), demanding Rs 20 lakh ransom. He said Rohit lodged an FIR with the Beur police station on May 29 after which a police team was formed to rescue Bhagat and nab the culprits.
 
 “Alok and Ravindra were lured to receive the ransom money from Rohit at Govindpur market area. On their indications, Bhagat was rescued and Rana was arrested,” he said. Rana and Ravindra had criminal antecedents, the SSP said.
 
 Meanwhile, police sources said Rana had paid Rs2.5 lakh to Bhagat, who had assured a Grade IV job for his son in the Patna civil court. Quoting Bhagat, police sources said he had paid money to one Siddharth. “Bhagat said Siddharth has good connections with a civil court employee,” sources said.
 
 The entire Grade IV staff recruitment process was scrapped by the Patna high court on April 17 this year due to violation of rules and large-scale anomalies.
