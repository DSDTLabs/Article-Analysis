SURAT: The Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology ( ), Surat, has been able to maintain its position among the top 100 engineering institutes of the country, but there has been a steep fall in its ranking. 

 The ministry of human resource development (MHRD), which on Tuesday announced National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) for 2018, showed SVNIT’s rank at 61. This was a setback because SVNIT’s rank in 2017 was 50 and 15 in 2016.
 
 The reason behind drop in the ranking is believed to be insufficient number of faculty members. At present, the institute has only 180 faculty members compared to sanctioned positions of 360 teachers. The institute has not undertaken a major recruitment drive for the last eight years, sources informed.
 
 “The institute is running with only 50 per cent of its actual sanctioned strength of faculty members. We are working on to make recruitment at the earliest and this will help us improve the ranking of the institute next year,” SVNIT director   said. 
 
 Fifteenth position among the top engineering institutes of the country in 2016 was a surprise for the faculty members and the administration of SVNIT. However, its overall development was credited to the authorities then. But since then there has been a steep fall in the institute’s position at the national level. 
 
 “We are working for overall infrastructure development to improve performance of the institute. Our focus is also on campus placement of our students who have so far received best jobs in the industry,” Gandhi added.
 
 The institute had to face tough time in 2015 when some girl students alleged sexual harassment by two male associate professors who were later dismissed. The institute again had to face trouble when a complaint of sexual harassment was made against a temporary employee.
