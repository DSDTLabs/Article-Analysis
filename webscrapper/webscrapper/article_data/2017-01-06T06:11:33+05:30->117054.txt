NEW DELHI: The   has asked the   to spell out the timeframe within which it would deploy   (VVPAT) in EVMs across the country in all elections to make the process more transparent.

 The   is meant to supplement the existing procedure of voting and it allows voters to verify their respective votes. 
 
 Under this system, a printout will come out after a person casts his vote, apprising the voter that his vote has been rightly registered. The printout is to be deposited in a box which can only be used by the   in case of an election dispute.
 
 In October 2013, the SC had directed the EC to introduce paper trails as allegations were being made from time to time that EVM machines were prone to tampering.
 
 It said that paper trail was an “indispensable requirement of free and fair elections”. A bench of Justices   and L Nageswara Rao asked the EC to give an undertaking to implement its order and also the timeframe within which paper trails would be introduced.
 
 “We direct the EC to bring on record the approximate time within which the entire system of VVPAT can be introduced subject to grant of sanction and release of funds as and when required,” the SC said. The SC agreed to hear a contempt plea against the chief election commissioner for the EC’s failure to implement the SC’s order “in true spirit”.
