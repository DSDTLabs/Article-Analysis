PUNE: The water resource department’s plan to provide water from   for crops through a pressured piped controlled   system has been tabled before the state cabinet.

 The project looks at supplying water from the dams for irrigation through pipelines instead of the current open canal system. The closed pipeline is expected to curb water transportation losses and instances of water theft and thereby ensure supply for the crops.
 
 About 21,300 hectare farm land spread in areas of Bhor, Velha and   is expected to get water through underground pipeline network. The water resources department has been working on the plan for the last few years.
 
 If the project goes ahead,   would be the first dam in the state to supply water for crops through a pipeline network. However, the project will have to go through various steps and also need a nod from the central water commission.
 
 Officials in the state water resources department said a detailed project report has been submitted to the state cabinet for recommendations. “Under the pressured piped irrigation system, there is a plan to set up a network of pipelines instead of canals. Water will flow to the targeted area only in pipes. A plan has been drawn up for laying the pipeline network,” the official said.
 
 It comprises two main pipelines and a network of pipes connected to the main lines. The department has estimated the cost of the project to be around Rs 1,300 crore. Sources said the state government would try to get funds for the project from the Union government’s scheme to ensure faster implementation of the project to get expected results.
 
 When contacted,  , minister of state for water resources, said the project was in the approval stage.
