MYSURU: A traffic cop who was caught while receiving money from an auto driver gulped down four currency notes of Rs 500 denomination to destroy evidence in the bribery case.

 Efforts by sleuths of the Anti-Corruption Bureau to retrieve the notes from the cop's mouth went in vain.However, they recorded the incident on video camera. Later, his saliva sample was collected as evidence and the cop was subjected to scanning at the government-run KR Hospital.
 
 
 
 
 MG Ramesh, an assistant sub-inspector attached to   traffic police station, had demanded Rs 3,000 from autodriver, Dharmendra, to re lease his seized auto which was involved in a road accident four months ago. The ASI allegedly told the auto driver to hand over the money to traffic constable Mallesh. The auto driver, in turn, lodged a complaint with ACB sleuths, who laid a trap and caught Ramesh red-handed.
 
 
 
 
 Ramesh was trapped near a juice centre and was being taken to police station, when he swallowed the currency notes.
 
 ACB SP BT Kavitha confirmed that Ramesh destroyed the currency notes which were evidence in the case by swallowing it. “Our efforts to retrieve it went in vain. However, we have recording of him swallowing the notes. He has also been subjected to medical tests.Constable Mallesh was arrested and produced before a court which remanded both of them to judicial custody,“ she said.
 
 
 
 
 After formation of the ACB last March, this is the first case wherein sleuths have successfully trapped a police officer in Mysuru division of five districts ­ Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajangara, Hassan and Kodagu.
 
 Ramesh was the face of city police at traffic awareness programmes conducted in schoolscolleges and at industries to educate students and workers on road safety. He was recently promoted and posted to KR traffic police.
