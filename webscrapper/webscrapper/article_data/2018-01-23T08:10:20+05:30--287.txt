Neeta said that since last two and a half years, her collection has been strongly influenced by Vrindavan . She said, “Since last two and a half years I have this connect with Radha Krishna and Vrindavan. We do this collection every season and it is called Vrindavan Symphony. We have sometimes musical instruments, sometimes bird motifs and this time we have used temple jhoola and the musical instrument inspired print in the collection. This collection presents Vrindavan by night, so it was reflected in the colours that were used in the collection.” Talking more about gowns and dresses with intricate embroidery in the collection, Neeta said, “My collection is always a fusion between Indian and Western, and this time we have used Edwardian motifs and the cuts were also very Edwardian.”

 Layering and drapes in menswear have been in for some time and designer Sadan Pande presented a collection that was a lot about layering on kurtas, drapes over kurtas and shirts paired with pants. The designer showcase a variety of designs in menswear ranging from casual kurtas and pants to bandhgala jackets and trousers and formal suits. He kept a look of the female models restricted to casual-cocktail wear in shades like blue, red, green and black. Talking about his collection, the designer said, “We worked on this collection because we wanted to explore designs for urban men who would like to move from lunches to clubs, formal meetings and would want casual, club wear and cocktail wear, which is easy to carry. We moved from subtle shades and lighter silhouettes to darker colours and flashy fabrics. Lot of shimmer has been added to the collection as it adds a new dimension to urban wear.” Jitesh Thakur, Mr Supranational 2016 second runner-up, was the showstopper for Sadan and he said that what he found out was that “both me and Sadan are narcissists as you can see me wearing a jacket created by him that has his initials embroidered on the pocket of the jacket.”

 There was no less bling on the ramp on the day two of Delhi Times Fashion Week and Ashfaque Ahmad’s show was the one with a lot of shimmer, sparkle and sequins. Be it dresses, pants, there was nothing understated in the collection. A few gowns with embroidered yoke were a few exceptions. When we asked the designer about his love for sequins, he said that sequins and bling is something which people ion Delhi love. “I also believe that bling is never out of trend. This was not a wedding collection, it was meant for parties and this line is for all those who look forward to being the head-turner at the party,” said Ashfaque and added that mostly people assume that designer wear is expensive, but when he was creating the line, he wanted to make it affordable. “The two things which are extremely important to me are affordability and wearability. Everything that was a part of the collection was simple and wearable,” he said. Yamaha Fascino Miss Diva 2017 second runner-up Apeksha Porwal was the showstopper for Ashfaque’s show.

 Just before they step into the professional world of designing, students of GD Goenka University, School of Fashion and Design, got an opportunity to present their collections on the ramp. The day two of the Dream Diamonds Delhi Times Fashion Week began with a group of 16 budding designers showcasing five garments each on ramp. GD Goenka University in collaboration with Politecnico di Milano presented a show called Collecttivo 2018. While some explored and worked with Indian weaves and craft, a few created futuristic designs highlighting the use of technology in fashion. One used Banarasi brocades to create jackets, panelled skirts and corsets and the other used indigenous weaves to create jackets worn over straight dresses. There were a few surprises for guests during the show. While the stars of the show were five kids who walked the ramp for Aaina Beri, a group of teachers walking on the ramp got a loud applause from the audience. The latter was a show by Madhav Kohli and was called ‘To Sir With Love.’ Prof Sasi Gopal Menon, Dean of the School of Fashion and Design, was one among those who walked the ramp at the show. He said, “The school nurtures the student’s inherent creativity, focusing it towards the industry and market.”
