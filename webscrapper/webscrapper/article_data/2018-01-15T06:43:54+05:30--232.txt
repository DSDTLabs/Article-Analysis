LUCKNOW: A meme showing chief minister   as the protagonist and SP leader   in a negative role went viral on social media on Sunday morning. 

 Titled 'Secret Superstar', the video, a little over two-minute long, shows Yogi as a destroyer of criminals and corrupt. It has been created by  , who had also made a meme on former CM   based on Shahrukh Khan-starrer 'Raees' before assembly elections. 
 
 In the video, Yogi replaces Tollywood superstar Balakrishna with dialogues in Hindi. In some scenes, his orignial vidoes have been used but voice-over replaced to suit the narrative. In one scene, he is seen instructing his two deputies to find out people's problems. 
 
 In another, mafia-turned-MLA   says " Yahan rahna mushkil ho gaya hai. (It has become difficult staying here)." At the end of the video, a common man shouts: " Dharti phad kar sher nikal aaya hai; ab har ek ke saath insaaf hoga" (A lion has emerged. Now everybody will get justice)" 
 
 Siddiqui said, "I am not a political person. I am into animation and I like doing my work."
