Ahmedabad: The Admission Committee for Professional Undergraduate Medical Educational Courses (ACPMEC) on Wednesday evening declared the provisional merit lists for admission to 14,000 seats in medical and paramedical courses in colleges in Gujarat. 

 The ACPMEC aims to complete the admission procedure by August 5, but the present rains and local floods across the states is worrying authorities. Though the admission committee has announced the schedule for all processes, it will see how adverse weather conditions affect the mock admission round from Thursday.
 
 Sources said that if students fail to participate in the mock round, authorities will reconsider the schedule. 
 
 As the admission process is taking place online this year, the authorities will check the level of participation by students in the mock admission round that will continue till July 29. The ACPMEC intends to begin the final round of admission from August 1, but this schedule, too, is subject to the weather conditions in the state. The committee has fixed two days from August 2 for final round of admission in medical and dental courses.
 
 There are 33,026 students who registered online, but only 21,989 students could complete the process of verification by July 21.
