LUCKNOW: BSP chief   on Thursday slammed the BJP for observing a fast against the non-functioning of Parliament and said it should have instead kept a fast against its MLA who is accused in   rape case. 

 Mayawati said BJP was making a mockery of fasting which was a way of demonstration for the harassed people. "BJP should hold a fast against the Unnao rape accused MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar on the banks of Ganga in Varanasi, which is the constituency of PM Modi. The MLA has not been arrested despite POCSO and other serious charges against him. BJP should apologise to the people for the jungle raj in state." 
 
 She said Unnao rape case has been handed over to CBI as the government wanted to suppress the case, as had been done with the Vyapam scam in Madhya Pradesh."BJP did everything to ensure that no business could be conducted in Parliament session to escape a debate on serious issues, questions on bank frauds, harassment of Dalits and the no confidence motion moved by its own allies. BJP is responsible for not allowing the Parliament to function but it is now trying to take a moral high ground," said Mayawati. 
 
 She said that instead of fasting, Modi government should apologise to the people for its anti-poor, anti-labourer and anti-farmer policies.
