Looks like ace badminton player PV Sindhu has had a change of heart. In an earlier interview to BT, the Olympic silver medallist had said that she would love to play herself if and when her biopic is made. But now, with Sonu Sood announcing a biopic on the young national icon, she feels differently. Sindhu says, “That was a long time back. Bollywood is full of talented actresses, I will leave it to Sonu Sood and team to rope in the best person to play my role.”  The badminton champ has dedicated herself to the sport since the age of eight and though she will be unavailable to guide the makers in their endeavour, her parents will be there to help them. She says, “For the past eight months, Sonu and his team have been doing research for the film. When I heard the script, I realised that they had thrown light on all aspects of my life. There are many defining moments in my journey. I have worked really hard since the age of eight, so each phase of my life is equally important. My parents are there to guide the makers. I will focus on the game.” Question her about her favourite biopic and Sindhu signs off with a smile adding, “Be it 'Mary Kom', 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' or 'Dangal', each one was inspiring in its own way. But my favourite is Bhaag Milkha Bhaag.”
