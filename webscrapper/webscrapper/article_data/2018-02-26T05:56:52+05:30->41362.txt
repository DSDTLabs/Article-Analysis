CHENNAI: A gang of thieves knocked out a 37-year-old   and his elderly mother by spraying a chemical on them after breaking into their house in   on Saturday night and made away with seven sovereigns (56g) of gold jewellery worth Rs 1.64 lakh and 2 kg of silver ornaments worth Rs 83,000 while they were unconscious.

 In a complaint on Sunday, Babu said his wife  , 32, and their children were out of town and he was at home with his mother   when the thieves struck at the house in   in Ponneri.
 
 Having failed to find fingerprints of strangers in the house, however, police officers probing the case have started by looking to rule out two possibilities: that the complaint is outright false; and that Babu got so drunk on Saturday night that, if thieves were responsible for the reported crime, Babu was responsible for being too plastered to do anything to stop them.
 
 Babu, an Amaravathi resident for 10 years, told the Ponneri police that he fell asleep on a cot near the main door and his mother went to bed inside. They woke late on Sunday morning, found the door forced open and discovered that gold and silver jewellery had gone missing from the house, he said.
 
 “It is surprising that Babu did not hear the thieves enter the house even though he was sleeping near the door,” an investigating officer said.
