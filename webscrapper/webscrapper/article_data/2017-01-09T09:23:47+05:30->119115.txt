HYDERABAD: Days after declaring publicly that customers who have lost their gold in the   need not pay interest till the gold is retrieved, the finance company sent out a message asking customers to pay interest as soon as possible.

 The message which was sent on Saturday by the   recovery cell asked the customers to pay their pending interest immediately to avoid high rates. “Please pay pending interest urgently to avoid high rate. Please ignore if already paid,” the message read.
 
 The customers who received this message were shocked and said that Muthoot could not do this to them when they had lost their gold.
 
 “I was surprised to see an SMS from Muthoot asking me to clear my dues when the regional manager clearly said that we need not pay interests till we get our gold back. I will visit the branch on Monday and will clarify the issue,” Ashok S, a customer, said.
 
 “Unless we get our gold back, we cannot clear any dues,” he added. “If this is a pre-programmed message, then it is fine. But, if the officials really want us to pay the interest now, then we have a serious problem,”  , another customer said. “Even if the message is sent out as per the schedule, the officials have to look into this matter and make sure that this won’t happen again,” he added.
 
 Neither the customers nor officials could confirm whether this message was sent out in spite of knowing the current circumstances or this was just an automated SMS. 
 
 One official, however, said that it could be a random automated message.
