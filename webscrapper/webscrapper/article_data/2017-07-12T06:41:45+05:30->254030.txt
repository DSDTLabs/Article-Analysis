CHENNAI: Frequent arrests of   by the Sri Lankan Navy and failure of the state government to secure their   and that of their boats came in for sharp criticism in the state assembly. The main opposition,   flayed the government for doing little in getting more than 50 fishermen and 140 boats, still in  , released.

 Participating in the debate on demand for grants for fisheries, DMK MLA and former fisheries minister K P P Samy took a dig at the frequency of meetings of constitutional authorities on both sides and the simultaneous arrests. He wondered if   was a friendly nation. “In 2007, when 97 fishermen and their boats were detained by Lankan Navy, our leader, the then chief minister M Karunanidhi secured their release with the help of Centre in half an hour. But you could do little,” the DMK MLA said.
 
 He said the state should prevail upon the Union government and get Sri Lankan government withdraw its Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act, tightening rules against trawling in Sri Lankan waters, since it would jeopardize the livelihood of TN fishermen. 
 
 Fisheries minister D Jayakumar said the state would continue to wage its legal battle to retain Katchatheevu islet. “Reclaiming the islet is the only solution and that is the reason why our leader (Jayalalithaa) moved the Supreme Court against the Centre,” the minister said, accusing the then DMK government of being part of the decision to cede the islet.
