  The arrest of a 60-year-old Korean director of a children's home at   on Saturday for allegedly sexually abusing the female juvenile inmates has stirred the   district administration, which has now started monitoring the activities of such   or homes for children across the district. 

 The social welfare department has also provided free legal assistance for the distressed children's safety and security. 
 
 On Sunday, a day after the arrest of the accused home director J K Bark and the woman treasurer Dipu Sarkar, all the 85 teen inmates in Kakinara's ' ' have also been shifted to several others juvenile homes.
 
 "All the children in that home have been shifted to our government-run juvenile homes, including Barasat and Bidhannagar for their safety and security. The guardians have also been informed that if they are willing to take back their children they can do it," Antara Acharya, DM, North 24 Parganas told TOI. 
 
 She also added that monitoring in such child care homes will be intensified. "After this incident, we will definitely do whatever needs to be done. But a complaint in such cases is very crucial on basis of which we can taken an immediate action," DM said.
