Mangaluru: The   and Bajrang Dal have assailed a decision by the Congress government to introduce the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Act-1997 to take control of Hindu religious institutions. They jointly demanded the state government withdraw the January 29 notification seeking feedback from people on its move to amend the act, which allows them to take over mutts and temples if they are in trouble.

 M B Puranik, working president, VHP, Karnataka, told reporters on Thursday, that the notification comes on the back of a similar attempt by the government, seeking the opinion of heads of police units in Karnataka, to withdraw criminal cases registered against minorities involved in communal incidents. “This latest notification seeking public opinion on the act is a continued part of the politics of appeasement of one section of society, at the cost of the majority community in the state,” he said.
 
 Puranik, a former member of the state Dharmik Parishat, wondered why haste was shown by the state government on the issue, at a juncture when Karnataka is close to assembly polls. “The government had all the time to seek the public’s opinion on this issue,” he said, adding that it was this very government that sacked the parishat constituted by the previous government, within 8 days of coming to power. “The government also showed no true intent in reconstituting the parishat,” he said.
 
 Describing the step as a means to draw a wedge between Hindus, and striving to divide them on caste lines, Puranik said this is also part of a larger design to polarize the majority and minority communities. “The state government has already shown its inability to manage temples under the religious endowment department, and will certainly not be in a position to manage the temples and religious institutions of Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists,” he added.
