NAGPUR: BRP-BMS chief   on Friday alleged Congress-NCP combine had fielded a weak candidate from Bhandara-Gondia parliamentary constituency for the by-poll. The party has therefore decided to field a candidate - LK Madavi, a tribal lawyer - from the constituency.

 NCP has fielded Madhukar Kukade, a former legislator, which has surprised many leaders in the party.   too has fielded another ex-MLA Hemant Patle. The by-poll was necessitated following resignation of BJP MP  , who later joined  .
 
 Addressing a press conference,   said Congress should have insisted on contesting the seat and fielded Patole. “Nana had directly taken on prime minister  . If he had won, it would have been a big slap on the face of BJP. However, Congress and NCP leaders have finished Patole’s political career,” he added.
 
 BRP-BMS president claimed enquiries were going on against many Congress and NCP leaders and BJP was using the probes as a leverage. “To save their skin, these leaders have conspired to ensure BJP candidate’s victory. This election is going to be a trendsetter for 2019 parliamentary elections at least for the state,” he said.
 
 Ambedkar said Congress leaders always blamed him for not joining hands with the party and even acccused him of being a BJP agent. “However, they never listen to me. For me the traffic should be two way. I do not believe in one way traffic,” he further said.
 
 “I had suggested Patole should be given the ticket but my advice was ignored. I offered Patole my party’s ticket,” the BRP-BMS leader said.
 
  directive to state government to terminate services of 85,000 non-tribals who had obtained jobs in ST category, Ambedkar said these employees should not be sacked. “Most of them are above 40. If they are dismissed, they won’t be able to start a new career. Their kids will not be able to complete their education,” he added.
