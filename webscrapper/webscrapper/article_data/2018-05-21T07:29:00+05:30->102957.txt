GHAZIABAD: A probe has been ordered against a gram   in   following allegations of misappropriation of funds levelled by members of same rural body.

 Dinesh   and Jaiveer Singh, members of the Dasna Dehat gram panchayat, have said in their complaint that though the rural body was given Rs 6 crore by the   Development Authority to carry out development in Indragarhi village, no road had been laid, sewer lines were broken and streetlights were defunct in the area.
 
 The probe against pradhan Reena Rani was ordered by the divisional commissioner (Meerut zone) after the two members approached the government’s integrated grievance redress system.
 
 Sources said divisional commissioner Prabhat Kumar had directed H N Singh, superintending engineer in the irrigation and water resources department, to conduct the inquiry. The block development officer of Rajapur has been asked to submit by May 22 a detailed report of the work carried out by Rani.
 
 “The entire work of the   pradhan is being monitored by her husband Satish Kumar Gautam. Any construction that has been carried out so far is of sub-standard quality. Moreover, work worth Rs 23 lakh that had been carried out by the previous pradhan has also been included in this year’s expenditure,” said Dinesh Kumar.
 
 “For instance, the pradhan and her husband have paid a contractor thrice for the construction of a single drain and a road in Gangapuram area. Interestingly, the work was completed in 2016 itself. They have also submitted inflated bills for many such projects. I have an entire list of such work and I have submitted it to the divisional commissioner and other senior officials,” he added.
 
 Satish Kumar Gautam, the pradhan’s husband, refuted the allegations against his wife Reena. “Very soon, I will file a defamation case against Kumar and the others. I am open to all sorts of probe by the administration. No misappropriation of funds has taken place,” he said.
