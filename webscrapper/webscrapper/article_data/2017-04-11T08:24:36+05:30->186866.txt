Mumbai: A sessions court on Monday   a 37-year-old man accused of throwing his two-year-old   out of the window. Mahesh Waghri was acquitting on charges of   and attempted murder of his wife. 

 Cops claimed that the accused, a utensil seller, suspected his wife was having an affair, which led to frequent fights. They said that on October 18, 2014, Waghri picked up a fight with his wife, and took their son and threw him out of the first floor window in Girgaum. Waghri then allegedly attacked his wife. Cops said he clobbered her with a hammer and slit her wrist. The woman was reportedly rescued by neighbours who heard her scream. The woman and child were rushed to hospital and the accused was taken into custody. The child later succumbed to injuries. 
 
 Waghri was initially booked for attempt to murder and the murder charge was added after the child’s death. 
 
 Defence advocate Prakash Wagh told the court that the accused was mentally unstable. “We produced medical documents to show the mental state of the accused,” Wagh said. He stated that the wife did not support the prosecution’s case and was declared hostile. “The wife told court that she had suffered injuries after the rack used to stack utensils fell on her. She said the child fell after her husband and her got into an argument over who would keep him while she went seek treatment in the hospital,” Wagh said. He said that in the ensuing chaos, both lost control of the child and he slipped and fell. 
 
 The accused has been in jail and had not sought bail.
