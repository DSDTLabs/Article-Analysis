INDORE: With the summer round the corner, many areas of the city are witnessing  . Though residents are not complaining about long  , but they complained about   in supply.

 Residents of areas like  , Radio Colony, Musakhedi, Sukhliya, Jinsi, Bada Ganpati and others are complaining about unscheduled power cuts. Some expressed their annoyance over the power cuts with approaching summer.
 
 A resident of Ajay Baagh Rahul Raikwar said that it’s a regular affair now. “Though the   claims to provide uninterrupted supply, but on every alternate day there is a power cut in our area,” he said. A resident of Radio Colony, Kushal Yadav said that as the summer is approaching, it’s a major problem for us. “On one hand, the approaching summer is keeping many people confined to their homes especially during afternoon hours, on the other, the power company is subjecting them to frequent unscheduled power cuts,” he said.
 
 However,   Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Ltd. (MPPKVVCL) claims that disconnection of power supply is due to ongoing development works of civic body. Officials have resorted to the power cuts for road widening works and demolition drives recently carried out in some parts of the city. Supply in some part of the city is also being affected as the discom has started shifting poles and underground supply lines due to road widening work. The civic body had sought permission for shifting of poles on various areas like Bada Ganpati, Jinsi square, Mhow naka, Tori Corner etc.
 
 “Electric poles were hampering traffic movement from Mhow Naka to Tori Corner that comes under redevelopment plan of Rajwada area,” said an official. He said that for shifting work of poles take at least four to five hours on each of the area. But supply is given within a short span of time as we have double supply lines in many areas.
