Since then they had been looking after the animal. When they came to know of   run by Mathur in Jaipur, they contacted him.
 
 He said though distance was an issue, he accepted their request considering their interest in the rescued animal. 
 
 First, he went to Hyderabad to take the measurement of the limb. “Measurement is key in the success of the artificial limb. A mild difference in the measurement will make the whole effort go in vain. So, I went personally to take the measurements,” he said. 
 
 He said that now the animal had to undergo about two to three weeks of physiotherapy and exercise to accustom to the new condition as it has been living with three legs for some time. “I have fitted artificial limbs to other animals like cows, dogs, etc., but this is the first time I have treated a horse, he said.
