Salem: State cooperative department minister ‘Sellur’ Raju on Wednesday appealed the media houses to act in a humanitarian way before publishing any news about the late Jayalalithaa and her hospitalisation. “We are saddened by the loss of our leader and it won’t be appropriate to discuss details about her medical treatment,” he said. The minister was in Salem to attend a function.

 Addressing the media, Raju said the state government had taken steps to issue crop loan to all farmers, including the newly-added ones in the current financial year. “Last year, then chief minister had ordered cooperative banks to issue crop loans to the tune of Rs 7,000 crore to farmers without interest. We have issued Rs 1,552 crore to 1.42 lakh farmers across the state till date from April 1,” he said.
 
 Referring to his recent meeting with 32 district cooperative society officials in Chennai, the minister said he had ordered them to disburse loans to farmers without any delay. “I have also urged the officials to monitor the entire process to avoid malpractices while sanctioning the loan,” he said.
 
 According to Raju, Jayalalithaa had given Rs 150 crore loan to the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Marketing Federation Limited for its expansion. “We used the amount to stock enough fertilizers in all the districts,” he said.
 
 Answering a question about the delay in issuing crop insurance amount to farmers, the minister passed the bucks onto the Centre. “Centre nominated the insurance companies and it should take action against the companies. We have brought this issue to the CM’s attention,” he said.
