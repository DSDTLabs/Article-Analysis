Aurangabad:   found himself in an awkward situation during the inaugural ceremony of a private waste water treatment plant in Osmanpura on Tuesday when local residents refused to wait for him and asked the Sena corporator who was present on the occasion to inaugurate it instead. Ghadamode reached the spot about 45 minutes late. 

 The residents of   co-operative housing society organised the inaugural ceremony at 11am on the occasion of Gudi Padwa. Accordingly about 150 people arrived on the spot including Sena corporator  . 
 
 But   who was supposed to inaugrate the private waste water treatment plant could not reach on time. So, the residents postponed the ceremony by 20-25 minutes, but when Ghadamode did not arrive even until then, they urged Raju Vaidya to inaugurate the plant. 
 
 Later, when dignitaries were watching the demonstration of the plant, Ghadamode arrived on the spot and attributed the delay to a previous function.
 
 But downplaying the incident Ram Bhogale, one of the residents, told TOI that it was Ghadamode who has requested the organisers to go ahead with the ceremony. “As the mayor was attending another function in the city he asked us not to wait for him. Moreover, he paid a visit to the spot, which is more important to us,” he said. 
 
 Bhogale further said that it was not feasible for the organisers to extend the time of the inauguration. “Being Gudi Padwa, guests and other dignitaries were busy with other commitments and thus we wanted to finish off the event as early as possible,” he said. 
 
 Commenting on the plant, Bhogale said, “Sewage water coming out from 10 to 12 households is being treated in the plant. We have set up the plant with an investment of about Rs 11 lakh. Around 4,000 litres of sewage water is being treated currently. One of the by products of the plant is nutritionally rich manure that can be used for gardening or farming,” he said.
