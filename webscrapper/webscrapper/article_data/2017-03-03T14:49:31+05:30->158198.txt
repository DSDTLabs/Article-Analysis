RANCHI: Students and parents breathed a huge sigh of relief as autorickshaw drivers on Thursday called off their wildcat strike in view of the ongoing matriculation and intermediate exams and Holi festival.

 On Wednesday, the public transport in the city was paralysed with several autorickshaws choosing to remain off road, to protest the route diversion for e-rickshaws and non-issuance of permits for other autos to ply within city limits.
 
 “We have decided to take back our strike on compassionate grounds. Children going to school to appear for their final exams were worst-hit. We feel they are being caught in the cross-fire and it would be unfair on our part to continue with this strike,”  , president of   state diesel auto drivers association (JSDADA), said. 
 
 The other consideration, Soni said, behind this withdrawal of the strike was financial. “With Holi round the corner, the strike would have hampered celebrations in the city and troubled daily commuters. Not just that, many diesel and petrol autorickshaw along with e-rickshaw drivers would have run out of income, for this is their source means of earning,” Soni said.
 
 However, the matter is far from over. Association members have threatened to resume the strike once the school examinations and Holi are over. “Neither the traffic police department nor the civic authorities have done anything to help alleviate our problems. We will take up this issue aggressively again after the festival,” warned Soni.
