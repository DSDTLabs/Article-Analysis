NEW DELHI: The Met office issues storm warnings but often these do not reach the people. This information gap is likely to be bridged soon, with a new system designed to reach mobile users in the affected area being tested, according to the head of the Met department. 

 
 “The mechanism, called ‘common alert protocol’, has been developed with the help of CEDAC and the National Disaster Management Authority. BSNL has been roped in for field tests in   and  ,”   director general K G Ramesh said. 
 
 Ramesh said accurate information about thunderstorms will hit is available 30-40 minutes prior to the event. “That gives us very little lead time for sending out alerts. Under this system, all active mobile users within the range of the cellphone towers... will be able to get the alerts,” he said.
