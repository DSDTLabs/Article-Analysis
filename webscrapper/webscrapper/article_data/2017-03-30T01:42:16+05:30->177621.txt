GURUGRAM: The brouhaha over legality of slaughterhouses and attacks on   has brought the focus back on Gurgaon’s lack of a  . The issue first came up for discussion in 2010, but   put the project in the cold storage.

 In 2011, MCG land in Sector 37 was allocated by Huda to establish a modern slaughterhouse. A firm was appointed to undertake a study and prepare a detailed project report (DPR) before it could be established. The slaughterhouse’s projected capacity was also finalised.
 
 As per the DPR, per shift, the complex was to have a capacity of slaughtering 500 goats/sheep (both halal and jhatka), 250 buffaloes and 50-100 pigs.
 
 However, in its place, there is now a fire station on the plot. “The idea behind a slaughterhouse was to provide wholesome hygienic meat to Gurgaon citizens and to follow the highest standards of public health. It would avoid environmental pollution, wastage of byproducts and prevent undue cruelty to animals,” said a MCG official.
 
 “We approached the Union food processing ministry and the animal husbandry department under Union agriculture ministry, for financial assistance to set up the slaughterhouse, at a cost of Rs 50 crore. But before we could proceed, Sector 37 locals approached the court and obtained a stay. Since the land was lying idle, we decided to build a fire station on it,” he said.
 
 Authorities say meat consumption in Gurgaon and nearby areas, procured from licensed and unlicensed shops, has increased a lot, which has made a slaughterhouse an urgent need. In its absence, animals were being illegally slaughtered across the city, they say.
 
 Deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh, under whose chairmanship a committee has been formed to identify an alternative location for a modern slaughterhouse outside municipal limits, could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.
