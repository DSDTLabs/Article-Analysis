CHENNAI: Soon after the   judgment on Friday which restrained the transfer of 2G licences of   by   group, the original promoter of Aircel C Sivasankaran has suggested that the department of telecommunications (DoT) sell Aircel and pay off banks. In an interview to TOI, Sivasankaran says the Supreme Court verdict tells the world that he was forced to sell Aircel. Excerpts:

 
 
 The Supreme Court verdict just tells the world today what was personally known to me that I was coerced into selling Aircel fully. I am glad that the Supreme Court ruled against the sale of Aircel. It will now be interesting to see how Maxis reacts to this.
 
 
 
 My prayer was simple: I told the   that I was forced to sell my company . This judgment validates my prayerrequest for justice. This also shows that the mighty alone will rule' is not possible anymore in India.
 
 
 
 DoT should find a buyer who will take over Aircel users. The buyer should be a stable operator like  , Vodafone or Reliance Jio. All three will be glad to take over subscribers. Whatever consideration the acquirer pays should be used to settle dues of Aircel and rest paid to   as they are the original owners.
