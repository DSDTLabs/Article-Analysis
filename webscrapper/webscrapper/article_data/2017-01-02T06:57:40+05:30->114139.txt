MUMBAI: On the first day of the New Year, the city woke up to its worst pollution levels since the Deonar dumping ground fire in early 2016. An air quality index (AQI) of 323 was recorded by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) on Sunday.

 The recorded AQI level was higher than the forecast of 302.An AQI between 301 and 400 is considered `very poor'.
 
 On days following the Deonar fire, the city had recorded an AQI of 341and 333 on January 29 and January 31. Among the other polluted days in the year was the day after Diwali (315) and Christmas (311).
 
 Researchers said the AQI levels were higher than the forecast due to the additional source of pollutants caused by the use of firecrackers. “During winter, the low temperature and stagnant winds make it difficult for pollutants to disperse faster, causing smog and very poor AQI levels. Visibility was low too,“ said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.
 
 The city's minimum temperature on Saturday stood at 16.5 and 21.2 degrees Celsius at Santacruz and Colaba bureaux respectively .
 
 The AQI is expected to bet ter on Monday. Safar has pegged it at 309--still in the `very poor' category .
 
 Meanwhile, anti-noise crusaders said that decibels levels at public places were lower than expected but private parties were noisy . “When we went out to record noise levels, it was great to see that there was hardly anything at the usual places,“ said  , convener, Awaaz Foundation, an NGO.
