HYDERABAD: With unauthorised structures coming up unabated in the metropolitan region, especially in gram panchayats, the   ( ) has decided to utilise technology to check illegal constructions in its jurisdiction.

 “A software on unauthorised buildings monitoring system is being developed, where local residents of the area can bring such constructions to the notice of the authority. Citizens can also share information with the HMDA and would be felicitated,” HMDA metropolitan commissioner   told TOI.
 
 The metropolitan commissioner on Monday held a meeting with the consultant especially engaged to develop the software to curb illegal constructions.
 
 Illegal buildings in gram panchayats have become a major concern to the authority as many panchayats were issuing permissions for over ground and two floors. Builders are raising additional floors and converting them into apartments.
 
 The state government has been able to bulldoze such constructions as the buildings and flats are being sold to gullible people immediately by the builders.
 
 The commissioner also said that the consultant has been asked to provide an option to know the status of their complaints by the general public online.
 
 “Complaints received will be verified by the authorities concerned by inspecting the site and uploading the images with ‘panchnama’ from the site. Local authorities will have to update about illegal construction activities in their area for necessary action. Cases can be initiated based on news appearing in the media too,”   said.
 
 If any owner proceeds to the court against the demolition, the system follows the case with appropriate documentation. There will be strict vigilance on demolished properties to ensure those are not reconstructed, officials said.
