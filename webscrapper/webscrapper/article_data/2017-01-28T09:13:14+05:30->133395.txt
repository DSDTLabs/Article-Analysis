LUCKNOW: The BJP will eventually succumb to a 'triple talaq' in the polls -it received the first 'talaq' from the people of Delhi, second in Bihar and finally the people of UP will say 'talaq' to the party in the forthcoming elections,   general secretary   said on Friday. Speaking to reporters at the party office here, Yechury also clarified that his party is not a part of the SP-Congress alliance in the state.

 “The   is contesting on a few seats in UP, the seats where the Left movement had left some impact on the public. Our aim is not to be a part of the government, but to ensure that the grievances of the common people are raised in the assembly, and accordingly the government frames its policies," Yechury said.
 
 The political reason for contesting the UP assembly elections is to defeat the communal forces. “We will work with secular forces wherever the BJP is strong. The BJP desperately wants to win the 2017 assembly elections especially for 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Hence, new problems have been forced upon common man,“ he said.
 
 Equating notebandi (demonetization) with nasbandi (sterilisation), Yechury observed that crores of people, especially small traders, marginal farmers and daily wage labourers have been affected by it.
 
 Replying to a question whether the Left Front would extend support to the SPCongress alliance after the elections, Yechury said the UP voters have been giving a clear cut verdict for the past two elections, and it would continue.
