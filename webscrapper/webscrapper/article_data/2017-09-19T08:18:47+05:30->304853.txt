KOCHI: Anybody who believes in   religion should be allowed to enter temples, according to some practioners of the faith who are well versed in scriptures. “If a person has a faith in the God she is keen to worship there should not be any restriction," said Sabarimala Thantri Kandararu Rajeevararu. The Sabarimala temple allows entry for people without imposing restrictions based on religion, caste or creed.“But we do not want people who visit temples as though it is some museum. Offering prayers is a matter of great faith and devotion. So one doesn't expect anybody to violate it," Rajeevararu said.

 Prema Pandurang, a   from Coimbatore said she has no idea from where in the history of temples, restrictions over entry sprang from. “But as a believer in this great religion, one feels adherence to Hindu principles and belief in Hindu scriptures, respect for   and sincere love and dedication towards the incarnations of the Lord qualifies a person to be a Hindu.“
 
 While most temples under the   has not put up the board ­ `No entry to non-Hindus' ­ the temples in central and north Kerala are more vocal about it. “This could be because people in the south are not so vigilant. The restriction is more to do with the `agama shastra' related to the rules of temple construction. There is a system in place and the rules have been set," said Akkeeraman Kalidasan Bhattathiripad, vice president, All India Brahmins' Federation.
