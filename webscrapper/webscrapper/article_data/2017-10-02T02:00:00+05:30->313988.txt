PATNA: The state   on Sunday set itself to implementing party president Amit Shah’s directive to take the decisions taken at the two-day national executive meeting held recently at Delhi to the grassroots workers by the end of this month.

 “As per the new rule of the party, all the decisions taken at the national executive committee have to be taken to the panchayat level within 21 days,” said road construction department (RCD) minister Nand Kishore Yadav on Sunday.
 
 This line has been introduced and adopted during the second term of Shah as the party president. In tune with the same, the party’s state unit has to first hold its state executive committee meet to adopt the decisions taken on September 25 and 26 at Delhi. 
 
 Subsequently, the party would hold meetings at district, mandal (block) and panchayat level within 21 days — that is, by the end of this month.
 
 To discuss the nitty-gritty of the preparations required to comply with Shah’s directive, the party’s state brass held their internal meeting on Sunday. The participants included state president Nityanand Rai, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and Yadav, as well as two general secretaries — Nagendraji and Rajendra Singh. The two-day state executive committee is slated to be held at Mangal Talab (Patna City) on October 6 and 7. 
 
 Yadav said developmental matters, including the achievements made under PM Narendra Modi at the Centre and under the NDA government in the state would be the focus of the executive committee meetings down the line. Besides, the party’s rank and file have to be set to fulfilling the Mission 2019 (parliamentary elections), so that the second BJP-led NDA government under PM Modi is also formed at the Centre.
