HUBBALLI:   of   at   in   has criticized the state government for declaring only 17,000 hectares of total 33,000 hectares of Kappatagudda as reserved forest. He demanded that the state government declare the entire hilly range as reserve forest. 

 Speaking to reporters here on Monday, the seer said, "The decision to declare only 50% of the area as reserve forest has created suspicion that the government is planning to allow mining activities in the remaining forest, which is said to have huge gold deposits. Many large mining companies have been lobbying to get permission to start mining in the forest range," he said.
 
  With hundreds of rare medicinal, aromatic and endangered plants and over 1,000 species of wild animals and peacocks, the Kappatagudda hilly range is "herbal heritage" of the nation, Shivakumar Swami said. "Allowing mining in such an eco-sensitive area will destroy the ecology irreparably. The state government should set up an ayurvedic research centre here to study the various medicinal plants. It should also document all plants and protect them," he said. 
 
 Shivakumar Swami informed that various activities have been conducted in  , like forming district-level committees, to create awareness on importance of Kappatagudda. "We would organize seminars in over 15 districts on the issue. We will launch 'Kappatagudda Samrakshana Jagruti Rathayatre' in these districts soon," he said.
