HYDERABAD: Don't   have the freedom to dress as they please? Not really, according to the Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas  . Addressing a press conference here on Monday, the minister said it is "his feeling" that no individual from the transgender community in the country should wear a sari. 

 Asked why transgenders should not wear a saree, Athawale said, "They are not men, neither are they women. But they are human... My suggestion is when not men or women, why are they wearing sarees?"
 
 Pressed if he had in mind any specific kind of dresses that transgenders should wear, Athawale repeated that in his opinion, if an individual is not a woman, that person should not be wearing a saree. "I made this suggestion at a meeting this morning where I addressed transgender people. My feeling is this. Everybody (transgenders) should not wear a saree," the central minister said.
 
 "They can wear pant and shirt. They should be wearing men's dress," the minster said.
 
 According to Athawale, the transgender population in India is approximately six lakh and the Government of India was taking several steps to assist and uplift the community. "They complained to me about harassment when they go to school or in other walks of life. The Central government will introduce a Bill in the next session of   that will give transgenders their due rights and protection," he said.
 
 The minister, in response to another question, said a proposal to set up special schools for transgenders could be considered on the lines of schools set up for other disadvantaged communities.
 
 It was during the 2011 census, the last to have been conducted, that transgenders were recognized as a separate group. Not just that, the census operation also collected data related to their caste, literacy and employment. As per the census, the transgender population in 2011 was about 4.88 lakh.
