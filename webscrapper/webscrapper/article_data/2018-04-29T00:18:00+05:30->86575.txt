Coimbatore: Municipal administration minister S P Velumani on Saturday said chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam would take a final call on taking Sasikala’s brother V K Dhivaharan in AIADMK. He said this while answering a question about the growing rift between T T V Dhinakaran and Dhivaharan. “People may come and go, but AIADMK is a strong party. We have been functioning successfully as a ruling party,” Velumani told reporters on the sidelines of an event to create awareness about online engineering counselling. School education minister KA Sengottaiyan, who was present at the event, said the new curriculum for Classes I, VI, IX and XI would be better than the CBSE curriculum.
