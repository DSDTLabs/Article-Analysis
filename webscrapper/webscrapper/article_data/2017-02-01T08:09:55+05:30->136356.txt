DHANBAD: The Rs 200 crore-road widening project, that will connect National Highway-2 to Giridih district, is looking at an uncertain fate following recent disturbances created by local anti-socials in the region. The project, funded by   (ADB), aims to widen the 45-kilometre road from 5.5 meters to 10 meters and construct three bridges on Kudia, Barakar and Usri rivers. 

 The construction work began in August last year by  . However, it got stalled when a group of 40 armed men raided the construction site at Barakar bridge on Friday night and vandalised it. The men also thrashed the workers who were sleeping near the site and took away their mobile phones, cash and construction equipment. 
 
 One of the workers,   from Bihar, was attacked by an axe on his head. He was sent to   (PMCH) here and then shifted to   (BGH), before being admitted to K M Memorial Hospital and Research Centre in Bokaro when his condition deteriorated.
 
 A senior official of construction firm told TOI, "We are supposed to complete the project in three years. But if these incidents repeat, the workers will leave. Almost all the old workers have left the site after the incident and the management is busy finding replacements. These instances will only add to the delay in the completion of the project and will also result in revenue loss."
 
 He added, "The Jharkhand government is organising the investor's summit in Ranchi on February 16. But if these incidents become regular, who will want to invest here?"
 
 A day after the incident, police superintendents from Dhanbad (rural), Giridih, along with a team of senior police officers visited the site.
