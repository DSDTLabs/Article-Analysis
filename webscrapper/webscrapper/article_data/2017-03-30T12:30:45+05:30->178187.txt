After baring his butt for an emotionally overwrought sequence in  's National Award-winning 2013 film, 'Shahid', in which he played the late lawyer and human rights activist   Azmi,   has taken it a notch higher. Mirror has learnt that the actor has now bared it all in ' ', his upcoming collaboration with Hansal, which is based on Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British terrorist of Pakistani origin who is most famous for his role in the 2002 kidnapping and murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.

  
  
 "It's an integral sequence involving frontal nudity where Rajkummar's character is shown having sex with a prostitute a day before he leaves for a terrorist mission. It took the makers a month to find an actress who would agree to be a part of said sequence before finally canning it in Delhi last year," informs a source close to the development.
 
 Rajkummar is known to internalise the characters he plays on screen, be it the geeky Govind 'Govi' Patel of 'Kai Po Che!', the passionate human rights activist-lawyer of 'Shahid', the desperate migrant   of 'CityLights' or Deepu Sebastian, Aligarh's journalist. For 'Omerta', he stayed in London for a while to get the hang of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh's way of life.
 
 "I like to push my limits and as an actor if I am convinced about a scene, I can do it. The butt scene in 'Shahid' was part of an emotional sequence. However, this one is more wild. I had discussed it with Hansal sir before we shot for it," Rajkummar informs.
