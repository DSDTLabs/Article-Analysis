He left the chest with his collegue as he started instructing the cab driver. A man walked up to this female employee and quietly threw notes at the entrance.

 Bank officials and traffic personnel posted outside the bank had no clue about the theft. Krishna Mondal, a tea stall owner, claimed she saw the accused. “There were two of them. They loitered for 10 minutes and kept talking in Hindi. They walked off towards Golpark but were back five minutes later. I offered them a table to sit but they refused,” claimed Mondal. Cops believe that the accused had carried out a complete recee of the area before striking.
