ROHTAK: Taking a cue from Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad,   plans to introduce a six-month   for   aged between 35 and 45 years. The idea is to train them in management skills and business environment. The programme will begin in October. IIM Rohtak director Professor   said the institute had sent a proposal to Directorate General Resettlement, Ministry of Defence.

 Sharma added the institute would seek a list of interested retired   from the directorate. IIM, Rohtak is looking at a batch of 50 students to start with. Sharma, who earlier taught at IIM Ahmedabad, said the candidates would have to crack an entrance test for admission to the course. 
 
 Sharing his experience, Sharma said Haryana had made immense contribution to the countryâ€™s armed forces it is worthy of such a programme. But he also added that 70% of the officers in defence failed to become colonel because of lack of leadership quality, discipline and capability to excel in tough situations. The programme is aimed at honing these skills
