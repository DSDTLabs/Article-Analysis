TRICHY: Children have become more rights-conscious and been vocal in expressing their views too. Plea for bus service, nutritious food and higher age limit for girls' marriage were some of the suggestions made by children to the   Commission for Protection of Child Rights for the draft   here on Tuesday. 

 Visually challenged girls A   who studies in standard XI and R Kaviya of standard IX were two of the 60 students from 30 schools in the district who recorded their views in Braille. It was the second day of the two-day programme organized to seek the views of the children on their four rights - to live, develop, safety and participation.
 
 Healthy food was top priority for Rabiya who opposed the practice of children consuming fast food. "Children are risking their health by taking fast food. If their health is weak, they will not be able to lead a normal life and can't achieve anything. So, I strongly oppose the propagation of fast food and request the commission to make sure all children get nutritious food," said Rabiya. 
 
 Kaviya was very critical about child marriages which forced school-going girls to enter into wedlock. "The age limit for girls for marriage should be increased to 22 so that they will not be subjected to marriage at the age of 17 years or below. The parents will have a fear that they will be penalised," she said. 
 
 One of the boys among the students came out with a suggestion that the government should provide exclusive bus service for ferrying students in the rural areas to their schools. He made this point to ensure transportation to the students and also prevent the children from being abused in the crowd on the public buses. 
 
 A class 9 girl, M Vinodhini from   near   was an example of children being forced to walk for nearly six kilometres a day to reach the government school in Pulivalam due to lack of bus service.
