GAYA: The Patna high   on Friday restrained the state government from awarding post facto approval to illegal structures in the   area. 

 Hearing a contempt of court petition in connection with the removal of encroachment/unauthorised construction from the Gaya   area, the division bench of Justice A K Tripathi and Justice Rajiv Ranjan Prasad also directed the Gaya DM to come out with a plan in four weeks to execute its order, said advocate Brajesh Kumar. 
 
 In compliance with the earlier direction, an aerial view of the Gandhi Maidan was shown to the court. According to Kumar, the court expressed its displeasure over the conversion of Gandhi Maidan into a concrete jungle.
 
 Gandhi Maidan, it may be recalled, was the only big chunk of open space available to the Gayaites and its encroachment has robbed the city of its lungs. The encroached area of the maidan is estimated to be about 5 lakh square feet. The unauthorised constructions include the   building and a guesthouse.
 
 On December 15, 2017 hearing, the Gaya DM was asked how much area was used for his residential purpose. An RTI query subsequently revealed that the Gaya DMâ€™s residence was spread over 14.72 acre land.
