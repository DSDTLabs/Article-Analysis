After Ganesh Raj’s debut movie Aanandam turned out to be a hit among youngsters, actress Anarkali Marikar has become a familiar face to the Malayali audience. 

 The short-haired actress who played a quiet and creative Darshana in the film, is now happy to bag a plum role in Prithviraj’s upcoming movie, Vimanam, directed by Pradeep M Nair.
  On her role, the director says, “Anarkali plays Gauri, a teenage girl. Hers is a pivotal role in the movie and the story progresses through her character. I cannot reveal more now.”
 
 The actress has completed her first schedule in Kochi and will move to Mangalore in a day or two. “I am excited that I have something solid to perform in the film. Unlike in Aanadam I have plenty of lines to deliver and offers scope for performance,” says Anarkali.
  She finds working with Prithviraj a great learning experience. “He takes the effort to teach me how to face the camera, adjust my tone and body language. He is a serious guy but comfortable to work with,” she says.
 
  Anarkali was initially considered for the role of Neena in Lal Jose’s movie Nee-Na, thanks to her tomboyish looks. “I was only in Class 12 at that time and I was not sure if I could pull off such an intense role, which had a lot of scope for acting,” she says. 
  Apart from Prithviraj and Anarkali, Vimanam has Lena, Praveena, Sudheer Karamana, Saiju Kurup and Alencier playing important characters.
