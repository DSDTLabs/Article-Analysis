GUWAHATI: Protests erupted in   on Wednesday after a lesser-known outfit, Bengali Sena Asom, warned   (Aasu) of 'serious consequences'.

 One  , identified as the leader of the organization, addressed the intimidating letter to the Baksa unit of Aasu, prompting workers of the latter to hit the streets in Mushalpur.
 
 Aasu activists burnt tyres and said, "Some people want to trigger   to divert attention from the burning issue of illegal immigration. The movement we launched after the Silapathar vandalism should not be turned into a clash between the Assamese and the Bengali-speaking people. Our fight is against illegal immigrants," said Aasu general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi.
