 “This was the second lighthouse of Madras, which was functional from 1844 to 1894. When the Madras High Court building came into existence in 1892, its main dome was taller than the lighthouse and therefore they cut open the dome and put the light inside it. And that served as the third lighthouse. The second lighthouse has got 197 steps to the lantern. And its architectural style is called Doric columns,” explains D Hemchandra Rao, a 
 historian.
