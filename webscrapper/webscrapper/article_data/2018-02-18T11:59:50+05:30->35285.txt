JAIPUR: Panic prevailed at the   village situated on the   route in   district after body of a young woman was found near the bushes on Saturday morning. Police have neither ruled out the possibility of murder nor   and have initiated a probe into the matter. 

 According to police, some locals after spotting the body which is yet to be identified informed the police control room. A team of senior police officers rushed to the spot. “Prima facie, it appears to be a case of murder, still the possibility of an accident can’t be ruled out. The yet to be identified girl is wearing a blue jeans and white top and we have sent the pictures to the nearby police stations to tally it with the missing reports,” said a senior police officer. 
 
 The age of body is between 25 to 30 years, according to the police.
