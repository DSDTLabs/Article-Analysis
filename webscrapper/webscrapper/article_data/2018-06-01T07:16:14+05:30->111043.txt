SHIMLA: At a time when entire Shimla is struggling to get adequate   to meet its daily needs and people are protesting against the failure of state government to ensure adequate supply, a BJP MLA's apartment has been found drawing water illegally from the main line at Jakhu. Deputy commissioner Amit Kashyap on Thursday directed the officials to disconnect the connection immediately. 

 Sources said the deputy commissioner received a complaint that Verma Apartment, owned by   Balbir Verma, at Jakhu was getting water round the clock and was drawing it illegally from the main line. During spot inspection, Kashyap found that connection was drawn from the wrong key, which was affecting the water supply downstream. "I have directed the irrigation and public health officials to disconnect the connection immediately," he said. 
 
 He said that during visit to Tuti Kandi area, he found construction activity going on despite the   high court's ban order on such activities in the wake of water shortage in Shimla. 
 
 "I have suspended any sort of construction activity for a week and further decision will be taken only after water supply normalises in the township," he added. 
 
 Even car washing remains completely banned in Shimla Municipal Corporation area for a week, he added.
