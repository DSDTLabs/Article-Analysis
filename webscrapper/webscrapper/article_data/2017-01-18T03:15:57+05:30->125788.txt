Thane: Residents from the lake city have already started making plans for the upcoming   weekend. From trekking to camping, Thaneites are exploring new weekend getaways.

 From trekking to   and Mount Kalsubai to night camping at Karwar’s Oyster Island, residents have chalked out their plans for their adventurous trip. 
 
 Shivani Ghate (27), a resident of Ghodbunder Road, said, “I keep going for nature trails and treks with my friends. This time I decided to rope in my colleagues as well. The weather, too, is ideal for trekking, especially for beginners, as you don’t get sweaty and exhausted quickly. The terrain is also less slippery than during the monsoons. We have planned an overnight camping trip at Oyster Island this weekend and a day trek to Mount Kalsubai on Republic Day.”
 
 Like Ghate, many others prefer to unwind and burn some calories at the same time.
 
 “I love trekking and my son loves camping, so we have planned a weekend camp to Rajmachi village, near Lonavala. As his class X exams are coming up soon, spending some time in nature should give him a break from his otherwise stressful schedule,” said   (43), a Kopri resident.
 
 Meanwhile, city-based   groups have begun taking additional efforts to plan a variety of such events for people of various age groups. 
 
 “After the rains, this is the ideal time for adventure sports, especially trekking and night camping, as the climate is pleasant and the skies are clear. On a daily basis, we receive a number of enquiries for information on the trekking, camping, rappelling, river rafting and even-bird watching events. There are families, friends and even colleagues who come to us with such requests. We have prepared several one day as well as two day trips to forts, trekking and adventure sports areas,” said Manoj Kalwar, who runs a adventure group.
