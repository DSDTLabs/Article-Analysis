Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Tuesday reserved its orders on a plea seeking drought relief for   in 21 districts including Thanjavur. 

 When the case filed by Tamil Nadu Coconut Farmers Association president Palani Vel came up for hearing before the division bench of justices M Sathyanarayanan and R Hemalatha, the petitioner’s counsel narrated the difficulties being faced by coconut farmers. He said that India topped in coconut cultivation, harvesting between 18 and 20 billion nuts from 1.97 million hectares of land. Of the country’s total coconut production, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh produced 90 %.
 
 Tamil Nadu was next to Kerala, producing 5,365 million nuts from 3.9 lakh hectares with Coimbatore, Thanjavur, Dindigul and Kanyakumari districts topping in production. During 2016-17, drought hit the coconut farmers who were unable to repay the debt sustained from agricultural activities. This had led the government to declare all 32 districts as drought-hit and announce drought relief of Rs 2,247 crore to 32,30,101 farmers in the state. It also said that the money would be straightaway deposited in the bank accounts of the farmers.
 
 The government released the relief amount of Rs 227.862 crore to coconut farmers living in 11 districts including Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode, Dindigul and Salem. But, it was yet to release the amount to the farmers in the remaining 21 districts including Thanjavur, the petitioner said.
