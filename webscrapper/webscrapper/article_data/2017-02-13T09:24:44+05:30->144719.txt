HYDERABAD: After facing a barrage of criticism for acquiring hundreds of properties and proposing to chop over 3,000 trees for the   (SRDP), the state government seems to be slowly pushing it through. The   (GHMC) has released a   (SIA) report in a bid to save the project.

 As part of the project, the GHMC had proposed construction of multi-level flyovers, skyways and grade separators at 18 places in the city at a cost of Rs 2,670 crore. The project envisioned flyovers around the KBR Park, including at Jubilee Hills Checkpost, Road No. 45 Jubilee Hills and Road No. 10, Banjara Hills. But after protests erupted to ‘Save KBR’, the National Green Tribunal had stayed the works around the national park.
 
 With an expanse of 390 acres, the KBR Park is bigger than the Hyde Park in London. Closer home, it draws comparisons with the Delhi Ridge since it is located at the highest point of the city at 610 metres above mean sea level. 
 
 The GHMC has now done the social impact assessment for constructing multi-level flyovers on various stretches at L B Nagar and JNTU, Kukatpally. “SIA reports for  , L B Nagar to Chintalkunta, and Rajiv Gandhi statue at Kukatpally have been prepared by Environment Protection Training and Research Institute on behalf of the GHMC,” the corporation’s chief engineer (projects) R Sridhar told TOI.
 
 Officials said that until recently, the GHMC acquired properties for various projects by taking consent from owners, who would then get either cash compensation or additional benefits such as transferable development rights for higher built-up area for fresh constructions. But with pressure mounting from owners for better compensation, the acquisition has been taken up under The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition and Resettlement and Rehabilitation Act, 2013.
