HYDERABAD: Wondering how even survey numbers of land were made to play a mischievous role in the indiscriminate sand mining, the Hyderabad high court on Tuesday stayed sand mining in   village of   mandal in East Godavari. 

 The bench of Acting Chief Justice   and Justice K Vijaya Lakshmi pronounced this interim order while hearing a public interest petition that charged the authorities with conniving with sand miners and allowing them to mine at sites that are unconnected to their leasehold areas. In the last hearing, the bench had asked petitioner's counsel N   to deposit 50,000 for his allegations to be verified by a district judge. The petitioner's allegation is that the sand miners got lease for mining in survey number 205/1, but were mining elsewhere in the village. 
 
 On Tuesday, the bench heard the matter again with the help of the district judge report, which said that the emergence of survey number 205/1 is a recent development and the reasons for the same are yet to be traced. This survey number was not there in Vangalapudi village in the past. The village map too shows it as a recent phenomenon. Excavation is going on in Survey number 2. It is not known as of now whether this survey number 205/1 and survey number 2 are same, the bench said.   referred to a 2017 report of tehsildar which conclusively said that the mining was being done in 205/1 and wondered how the revenue officer so conclusively said about a survey number whose existence is still in doubt. The bench posted the case to three weeks for hearing.
