BATHINDA: Panthic organizations have accused the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress government of failing to solve the sacrilege cases even after 70 days of its current stint. The organizations will hold deliberations and stage a protest at Bargari village of Faridkot on June 1 on the completion of two years of Bir of Guru   going missing from the gurdwara in   village near Bargari.

 The first case of desecration was reported at Bargari on October 12, 2015 when torn pages from Bir of Guru Granth Sahib were spotted outside the local gurdwara. It led to strong protests and two Sikhs were killed in police firing at   village near Bargari on October 14 while agitating against the sacrilege. 
 
 Sikh preacher  , who has been appointed as the ‘jathedar’ of   by the ‘Sarbat Khalsa,’ told journalists at Bathinda, “It has been two years since the Bir was stolen. Neither the previous SAD-BJP government and nor the current incumbent has been able to solve the case. On the contrary, many incidents of desecration have taken place in the last two months during the Congress rule. Concerned over this, the Panthic organisations have decided to held deliberations and a protest at Bargari.”
