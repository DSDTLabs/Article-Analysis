GAYA: Ever heard of rats eating human organs? Sounds bizarre, but it allegedly happened in the emergency ward of the   and Hospital on Thursday night.

 One Raj Kumar Prasad (62), a resident of civil lines area of the town, who was admitted to the hospital on Thursday with complaints of oregano phosphoric poisoning, died in the same evening. Hospital superintendent   said since it was a medico legal case, the attendants abandoned the body and disappeared.
 
 Next morning, Raj Kumar’s son went to the hospital and complained that one of the ears of his father was missing. He later alleged that since the body remained abandoned in a remote corner of the emergency ward of the hospital during the night, rodents had a good meal.
 
 Magadh divisional commissioner Jitendra Srivastav said he had ordered an inquiry into the incident. “Notices have been issued to the health manager, medical officer and a nurse who was on duty that night. Action will be taken against those found guilty,” Srivastav added.
 
 Sources, however, said the inquiry has hit a roadblock as, while handing over the body to the attendants after post mortem on Friday, the hospital personnel did not get the body videographed. Evidence collection, therefore, has become a big challenge for investigators.
 
 Hospital superintendent Dr Sinha said he was on leave on Friday when the incident came to light. He, however, claimed the body was kept on the stretcher and the area was properly netted. “It is surprising how the rodents managed to enter the otherwise protected area,” said the superintendent.
