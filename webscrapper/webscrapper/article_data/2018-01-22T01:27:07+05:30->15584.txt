Chennai: The now defunct Madras Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( ) has sent a request to the Chennai   to grant permission for their inspectors and sub-inspectors to book cases of cruelties against animals. 

 The society’s secretary in his letter said the Union government framed a few rules in 2001, known as   constitution rules. Under these regulations, the state governments were directed to form SPCAs in all the districts under their jurisdiction. Till the formation of a new society, the existing MSPCA was permitted to function as the SPCA. 
 
 In Tamil Nadu, though the government constituted SPCAs in many districts, no society was formed Chennai. As MSPCA is a pioneer in taking action against those inflicting cruelties on animals, the state government recognised them and allowed the body to continue as SPCA. However, a vested interest group filed two petitions in the Madras high court in 2010 and 2012. It was then that the court directed the government to form a new SPCA under the 2001 rules of the Prevention of Cruelties to Animals Act of 1960. 
 
 Pointing out at the blatant anomaly of a defunct body asking for powers, former inspector of SPCA recalled the time when the administration while changing the name from SPCA to MSPCA surrendered its powers of the field staff such as inspectors and sub-inspectors (SI). Earlier the SIs would conduct inspections and nab those who were found to be inflicting cruelties on animals and penalty would be imposed on them under 1960 Act. 
 
 “All these years the organisation was functioning by doing an honourable service to animal welfare. With the changed name and without powers, now they are approaching the Chennai collector to accord powers to them. This is very contradictory behaviour of the administration,” he pointed out.
