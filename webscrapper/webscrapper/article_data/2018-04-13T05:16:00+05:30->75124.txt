NEW DELHI: Accusing   of pursuing divisive and disruptive politics, BJP president   on Thursday said the washout of the second leg of the Budget session was opposition’s ploy to derail the Centre’s initiatives for the welfare of the poor. 

 
 “Parliament is temple of democracy where political parties legislate and work in cohesion to draft policies. However, Congress resorted to disruptive politics and did not allow the House to function. People of the country will never forget Congress, which derailed the clearance of policies meant for the welfare of the poor,” Shah wrote in a blog-post on Thursday. 
 
 Shah alleged that despite assurances of finance minister   and home minister Rajnath Singh, Congress didn’t want a meaningful debate on key issues even as BJP agreed to take up all issues including PNB scam or the demand for special status to Andhra Pradesh.
 
 “Congress seemed to have a penchant for disruption. Paying no heed to parliamentary responsibility, Congress didn’t allow the debate, which was also defiance of the lawmakers’ commitment to the public,” Shah said. He said   could not function for 22 days and 121 hours of   and 128 hours of Lok Sabha were wasted in the process.“Functioning of Parliament involves huge expenditure. Rs 1.57 crore and Rs 1.10 crore per hour are incurred in running the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha respectively. Around Rs 333 crore of public money was wasted due to Congress’s disruptive politics,” he said.
