 Bengaluru: The hopes of 109 convicts, including seven women, awaiting premature release will be fulfilled once governor Vajubhai Vala gives his nod.
 
 These prisoners, lodged in eight different prisons across the state, were shortlisted for premature release on good conduct. They should have walked out of the jails on January 26, revealed home department sources.
 
 “We are told that the file is with the legal cell of the Raj Bhavan and it seems they are examining the antecedents and behaviour of each prisoner recommended for release. Once the legal cell hands over the file, saying the convicts can be released, the governor will sign it,” the sources told TOI.
 
 Family members and friends of most of the 109 convicts were waiting outside the prisons on January 26, prison sources said. “We had not made any official communication to the families of the convicts, saying we are releasing them on January 26. Still, they were waiting outside the jail,” the sources said.
 
 Since 2015, a total of 1,050 convicts, including 55 women, have been released for good conduct basis, the home department sources said. 
 
 “During 2007-15, no convicts were recommended for premature release. In 2009 and 2016, 50 convicts had staged protest inside the prison, seeking premature release. The protest held during 2009 was more effective as more than 600 convicts from eight central prisons had gone on a hunger strike,” the sources said.
 
 “After a gap of eight years, 160 convicts were released in mid-2015 for good conduct,” they added.
