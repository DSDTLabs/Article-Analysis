INDORE:   demand by   in Pithampur has jumped by over 10 per cent this year. Arrival of new companies in Pithampur and expansion by existing industries has resulted in increased water intake in the industrial belt.

 Audhyogik Kendra Vikas Nigam (AKVN) managing director Kumar Purushottam said, “We have seen a   in water consumption by industries in Pithampur. Our monthly water bill has gone up and company-wise requirement is also scaling.”
 
 According to AKVN, water consumption in Pithampur has jumped from 18 MLD to 20 MLD this year.
 
 The industry department’s monthly water bill has gone up from Rs 1.60 crore to Rs 2 crore.
 
 Pithampur Audhyogik Sangathan president Gautam   said, “Several new companies have set up their operations in the region in recent months resulting in increased water intake.”
 
 According to industry estimate water consumption is expected to rise further from present levels as more new ventures are likely to establish their units in the region.
 
 In January alone, seven new firms were allotted land by the industry department while a few are in the pipeline. Few of the existing industries of the region have also expanded their operations such as SRF, Lupin, Motherson and others.
 
 Purushottam said, “Motherson has expanded their manufacturing unit in just a span of 1 year and they have come up with a second plant in the region.” 
 
 SRF has also expanded its operations and water requirement by the packaging industry rose by about 150 Kilo liters per day.
 
 Likelihood of water supply from the under construction   project by this summers may ease water crisis of industries.
 
 Kothari said, “We hope to get good amount of water from the Narmada project phase 1. If this starts then hopefully there will not be any water problem.”
 
 AKVN is expected to supply water from Narmada project by May while the full-fledged supply will commence from December.
