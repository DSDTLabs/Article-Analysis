MUMBAI: The plan to run a cruise service between Mumbai and Goa has hit choppy waters again. The service is likely to commence only after monsoon as the operator has not been able to get the ship ready in time.

 Cruise services can be operated only during fair weather—between October and May for Mumbai and Goa. 
 
  (MbPT) said that the infrastructure at the domestic cruise terminal is already in place to host the cruise service.
 
 An MbPT official said, “The operator has bought a used ship that is undergoing repairs and refurbishment. We are approaching May-end so the chances of operating the cruise are almost nil.” The director of  , which will operate the services, Siddharth Newalkar did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages.
 
 The MbPT official said, “After the repairs, the ship has to get a clearance to ensure it is sea-worthy. Later, trials will be carried out before the cruise can set sail.”
 
 The plan is to set sail from Mumbai at 6pm and arrive in   the following day at 8am. The services have been planned on alternate days. The cruise will halt at Dighi, Dhabo, Jaigas, Vijay Durg and Mavlam. Though the fare is undecided, authorities expect the operator to charge Rs 5,000 per passenger for a one-way trip. Passengers will have to pay more for food and beverages and other on-board entertainment facility.
 
 The cruise service was to begin in December 2017. But the date was revised to March and later April. In the sixties and seventies, a pair of steamers—Konkan Shakti and Konkan Sevak—used to ply from Mumbai to Goa until it was discontinued in 1991. The journey then took 24 hours.
