HYDERABAD: Leader of the opposition in the   Mohd Ali Shabbir on Tuesday castigated the narendra Modi-led government at the Centre for scrapping the Haj subsidy and described it as aclear anti-Muslim act to please the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is presently touring the country.

 Reacting to the cancellation of the Haj subsidy for 2018 Hajis, Shabbir Ali said Union minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi’s announcement has come as a shock for nearly 1.75 lakh   from India whose applications have been processed and are preparing for the journey.
 
 “The Union minister's statement that Haj subsidy has been scrapped for the sake of empowering Muslim women is a clear indication that BJPled NDA government is not interested in spending money on Muslim minority community,” he said.
 
 Shabbir Ali demanded that the Centre ensure the continuation of medical camps at Jeddah, Mecca and Madina to cater to the medical needs of the haj pilgrims particularly the elderly as extending medical care is the responsibility of the state and Centre. He said that if the Haj subsidy is being viewed as a burden on the “sick”  , the Centre should invite tender other airlines to participate and provide cheap flights. “Several airlines would be interested to offer competitive fares as nearly 1.75 lakh Muslims from India go to Haj pilgrimage every year,” he said.
