Margao: Town and country planning (TCP) minister Vijai Sardesai on Thursday allayed the apprehensions of Comba-Margao residents who fear being displaced by the much delayed Margao ring road project being undertaken by the PWD. After conducting a site visit of the Comba-Margao subway, Sardesai listened to the affected residents who expressed fears of being displaced by the PWD project and forced to reside alongside other slum dwellers elsewhere in the town. Sardesai assured the residents of the 14 houses situated in the ward near the railway tracks that he would ensure that the locals wouldn’t lose their identity as they are provided alternate living arrangements. The Fatorda MLA directed the PWD engineer to provide him the file of the project on May 23, after it was brought to his attention by the local councilor, Ketan Kurtarkar, that there was a vague mention of ‘future development’ in the project plan. Sardesai opined that the acquired land be handed over by the PWD to the housing board so that the local residents could be rehabilitated.
