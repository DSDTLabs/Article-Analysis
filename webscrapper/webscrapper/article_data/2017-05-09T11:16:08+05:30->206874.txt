PUNE: The   police on Sunday arrested a 28-year-old grocery shopowner for allegedly sending lewd messages and obscene photographs to a married woman since the last eight months.

 The matter came to light on Saturday, when the woman approached the Samarth   after the suspect threatened to kill her husband, police said.
 
 An officer told   that the woman is a homemaker. In October last year, she had gone to the suspect’s shop to recharge her number. “The suspect had noted down her number and started calling her,” the officer said.
 
 The officer said initially, the woman spoke to him over phone. However, she got suspicious after the suspect started forwarding her lewd messages. 
 
 “When the suspect started sending obscene photographs to the woman, she had requested him not to send her such content,” the officer said.
 
 “Despite the woman’s requests, the suspect continued to send the messages and photographs. He even threatened to inform her husband, if she stopped replying to him,” the officer said.
 
 Recently, when the woman stopped responding to him, the suspect called her and threatened to kill her husband. 
 
 The suspect was booked under section 354 (D) (stalking) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act.
