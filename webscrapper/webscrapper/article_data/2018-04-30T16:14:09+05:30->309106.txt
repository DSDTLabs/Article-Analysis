 never fails to make an impression with her sartorial choices. Every year, fans all-over-the-world wait for her red carpet appearances at Cannes Film Festival. Whenever she steps out in couture or ball-gowns, she makes us weak in our knees. Remember her Cinderella-esque gown at Cannes this year? It was breathtaking. 

 
 Out of all the Bollywood stars, spotting Aishwarya at any event or party is rare. Recently, the actress was seen attending 'Women of the Year Awards' hosted by a magazine. She joined the likes of Gauri Khan, Sonam Kapoor and Twinkle Khanna at the awards ceremony. This year, she was honoured by 'Vogue Influencer of the Decade' award at the affair.
 
  
  
 
 For this event, she was dressed in a black gown and we're a little disappointed. The gown had sheer detailing and a train. They say you never go wrong with black, but this gown did the opposite. It had long bell-sleeves with elaborate fringes, which didn't work at all. The same fringes were on the train as well, which was a bit much. Overall, this outfit was little OTT with really long sleeves, sequins all over and the extra train. We wish she opted for a classic black gown over this one.
