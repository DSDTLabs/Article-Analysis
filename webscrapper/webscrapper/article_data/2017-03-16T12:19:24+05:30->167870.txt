LUCKNOW: Diversions for   have been altered with effect from March 15 and now traffic from   towards GPO crossing will take the other side from Mayfair trisection up to  . 

 As per   Rail Corporation's plan, underground Hazratganj station has to be constructed beneath MG Road from DRM office to Mayfair trisection. Since MG Road cannot be blocked completely, LMRC will barricade one side while keeping the other side open for vehicular movement both ways. 
 
 So far, traffic from GPO towards Parivartan crossing was diverted towards Sahu Cinema side from Janpath Market up to Mayfair trisection but now this side has been opened for direct movement while other side has been closed. 
 
 LMRC managing director Kumar Keshav told TOI, "Now, we have barricaded the road towards Sahu Cinema side while opening the Janpath market side as we now have to begin underground construction. For about one year, people will get only half the width of MG Road to commute on both sides. The underground construction of Hazratganj station will take about a year."
 
 The engineer in charge of the project said in any case, LMRC will always open half of road for traffic movement. "We have begun trial to see the requirements and problems faced by public as per new diversion plan of Hazratganj. We will deploy Metro marshals and barricades depending on the need," he said. 
 
 Director of works and infrastructure, Daljeet Singh said LMRC has already concretised about 50metre patch near Janpath.
