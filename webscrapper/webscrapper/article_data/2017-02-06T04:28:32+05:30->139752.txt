PANAJI: An   that laid 133 eggs at Galgibaga beach at 4am on Sunday has added to the turtle lovers’ delight, as the total nesting on Goan beaches has risen to six in just over a fortnight.

 Two turtles first arrived at Morjim and   on the same day on January 19 to start a delayed nesting season. But three more flippered visitors surfaced quietly at the beach sites amidst the election din and scorching January heat and soon took the tally to five with the total eggs laid to about 540 in number.
 
 Forest officials and local residents are slowly getting used to the delayed arrival of turtles for nesting. In the past, the season would start anytime after September and end by March-April.
 
 “The general view is that it is due to climate change, but it is a matter to be studied by scientists,” Gaonkar said.
 
 “On Sunday morning, the turtle at Galgibaga laid 133 more eggs,” Vikramaditya Gaonkar, range forest officer (wild life), Cotigao said. The six nests include two each at Agonda and Galgibaga and one each at Morjim and Ashvem.
 
 No turtle nesting had been reported at the Ashvem stretch during the last 2015-16 season. Noisy tourism activities on the beach, which was once quite desolate, had increased over the years, said sources who keep track of the turtle movements.
 
 “The turtle that came here on January 28, laid 107 eggs, but as they were in a damp area, they were shifted to higher ground,” a source said.
 
 At Morjim, the 123 eggs laid on January 19 were shifted from the beach spot overlooking the Chapora river mouth to the interpretation centre manned by forest guards. “It is easier to keep vigil here,” a source said.
 
 The incubation period extends to about 55 days and the forest staff are keeping vigil over all the nests.
 
 In Agonda, the first flippered visitor deposited 133 eggs in a pit on January 19 and 115 on January 30. “The turtle at Galgibaga laid only 61 eggs,” Gaonkar said.
