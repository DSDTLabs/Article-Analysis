Celebrated on the first Friday the 13th every year, who would have thought that being in denial can also be a cause for celebration. This day is also known to be a compulsive liar’s dream day — with pointing fingers at anyone you would like to pass the blame onto and lie through your teeth. So, whether it is your friend, parents, siblings, friends, in-laws or even your spouse — spare no one! This brief madness was introduced by a lady called   in Michigan who started the trend in 1982 as an excuse for not keeping her appointments on the fateful day of Friday the 13th. This day is celebrated around the world with a lot of fun and enthusiasm. There are a number of fun games which are organised on this day. Some of them are like pouring chocolate mousse in people’s shoes and blaming the pet dog, loosening the screw on your colleague’s chair, etc. 

 
 
 
  Start by making a detailed list of all the mistakes that you have made in the past and write them down. It doesn’t have to be the bigger mistakes in life. It can also be the petty ones also. 
 
 
  This is the fun part. You can list down whoever you wish to blame for the mistakes and surprise them later in the day. You don’t have to be modest, you can choose whoever you want — friends, family, colleagues or even your superior. 
 
 
 This is the time when you have to hold onto your giggles and let the concerned person know the mistake he/she has made. Do not go soft on the person. And, don’t worry, you won’t be called a sadist later. 
 
 
  The fun part of this game is to let others believe and accept the fact that the culprit is not you but somebody else. Wait till everybody else around you is convinced. You can reserve the apologiesfor tomorrow.
