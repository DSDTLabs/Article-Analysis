Mumbai: After 25 months, the   touched 30K level once again but closed just a tad off that level at 29,974, a new closing high, as foreign funds continued to buy Indian stocks. 

 The day’s rally was boosted by strong gains in Reliance,   and L&T with investors’ wealth, measured by BSE’s market capitalisation, now at Rs 123.3 lakh crore, a new all-time peak. On the NSE, the Nifty closed 27 points higher at 9,265, also a new all-time closing high. 
 
 On March 4, 2015, after the RBI surprised market with a rate cut, the sensex had rallied to its all-time high of 30,025 in intra-day trade but had closed at 29,381. For the last one month the index has been hovering above the 29K level.
 
 Official data showed that so far in April,   (FPIs) have net bought stocks worth $628 million. This is in addition to $4.8 billion net buying in March, taking the total for 2017 to $6.7 billion. On Wednesday, end of the session data showed an   net inflow of Rs 340 crore.
 
 The trend in FPI investments indicate that foreign fund managers turned bullish since mid-March, after the BJP got a strong mandate in the state elections, especially in UP where it registered a landslide win. 
 
 Several FPIs were under-invested in India since the government started its demonetisation move on November 8 and also US Presidential elections results, that came the next day, institutional dealers said. 
 
 Brokers also said that since India is again coming out to be a preferred investment destination among emerging markets, foreign fund managers are investing here. A report by Motilal Oswal Securities showed that in March, in dollar terms, the sensex had given a return of 6%, compared to 4% each by South Korea and Indonesia and -3% by Brazil. This made the Indian market the best performing large market in the world.
 
 The recent appreciation of the   against major currencies and the central government’s push to roll out GST by July are also the reasons FPIs are bullish on India.
