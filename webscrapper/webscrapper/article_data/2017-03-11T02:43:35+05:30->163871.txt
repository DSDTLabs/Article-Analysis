NEW DELHI: A delegation of the “DU Fights Back” collective, which included students from various colleges and Left-backed organisations, on Friday met the   deputy proctor and submitted a petition demanding an inquiry and “punishment to the perpetrators of violence on February 21 and 22.”

 The students claimed that many assaulters were outsiders and their entry should be stopped. The petition, signed by over 2,000  , demanded “immediate rustication of those students seen assaulting others in the video evidence available in the public domain and with the police.”
 
 The deputy proctor assured the students that the university will look into the issue and a meeting with the VC will be fixed next week. Blaming the DU administration for favouring  , president of DU AISA Kawalpreet Kaur said, “It is shameful and shocking on part of the administration that it has not even given a symbolic statement of condemnation, leave alone start an inquiry.”
 
 Kaur added that they have filed a PIL in HC for punishing the culprits. “While most events at DU are being cancelled over security issues, we see those involving RSS and BJP still being held,” she said, attacking the Law Faculty event where BJP MP Subramanian Swamy was invited.
