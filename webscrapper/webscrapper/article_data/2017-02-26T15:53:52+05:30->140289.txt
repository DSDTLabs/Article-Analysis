The film was flagged off on Monday and is expected to be wrapped up by summer-end. The Tamil original that released in 2014 had Vishal and Shruti Haasan as the lead pair and it went on to do well at the box office. Anjaniputra is Harsha's first film with Puneeth and there are a lot of hopes pinned on the film, given the films with Shivarajkumar have been box-office successes.
