AHMEDABAD: Jignesh Mevani, convener of   (RDAM), on Monday alleged that the state government has given 200 acres of land which was allocated to landless dalits of the region to the   (SIR) in Dholera taluka of Ahmedabad district.

 Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mevani said, “The 200 acres in   and Bavaliyari villages near Dholera were allocated on paper 25 years ago. But the state government and the district administration never gave actual possession to the dalits. Even after the community made several representations to various government officials, right from mamlatdar to the chief minister, it was not allocated till date.”
 
 “The government turned deaf ears to the demands of the dalit community and it gave the 200 acres land to the Dholera SIR in 2012,” he added.
