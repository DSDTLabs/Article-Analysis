 “The discom has received Rs 130 crore under the Integrated Power Development Scheme and the development work will include new power sub-stations in Mumbai and Thane, besides transformers, feeder pillars and underground high tension wires,” an MSEDCL official said. “In view of the growing population in these cities, there is an urgent need to revamp the power   and replace old cables and such.”

 “However, the power utility will have to pay fixed charges for road digging and for reinstating the road after laying cables,” a municipal official, who requested anonymity, said. 
 
 MSEDCL officials said existing municipal digging charges were “exorbitant”.
