Visakhapatnam: With the Vuda Haritha Housing project being delayed for more than three years, the Vuda Harita Allottees Association (VHAA) has urged the vice-chairman of Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (Vuda) to complete the project at the earliest. 

 In a letter to Vuda VC T Baburao Naidu, association president Prof Gan Bhukta said, "We are very concerned and worried that a lot of promises and assurances made by VUDA and actions to be taken in regard to Harita Project by various departments in VUDA have not been implemented because of which the project is at a standstill. In all our meetings and interactions with you and VUDA officials, we were promised that all pending Harita works would be completed on a warfooting to enable us go for immediate registration/occupation but we are constrained to inform you that things are moving at snail's pace."
 
 Elaborating on the issues faced by the 710 allottees of the project, Bhukta demanded immediate completion of promised covered parking for approximately 230 allottees who were not provided with the same as assured in the agreement.
 
 He said experts from ministry of environment and forests as well as AP Pollution Control Board had confirmed that the 20-acre Haritha project should be provided with 20-30% greenbelt as per government formulated norms in place of the present ornamental plants/garden that are dying already.
 
 Prof Bhukta wrote, “During the recent visit by the vice-chairman with VHAA to the site and as per the minutes of the meeting, you not only agreed to provide the greenbelt as per governmental norms but also graciously consented to undertake maintenance of the garden by Vuda for the next few years until such time the greenbelt comes up and to this effect arrange to get a resolution passed in the board for continuity by your successors.”
