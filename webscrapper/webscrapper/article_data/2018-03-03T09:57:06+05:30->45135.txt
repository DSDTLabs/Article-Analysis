GUIRIM: Thousands of devotees beating the scorching heat walked up the   hill with patience and prayerful solidarity on Friday to venerate the relics of   of Padua, that are on display at Alverno Friary, Monte de Guirim. 

 A huge beeline of devotees were lined at the steep slope of the hill right up to the chapel where the relics are kept. 
 
 Elaborate arrangements were made for the smooth conduct of the veneration, as senior citizens were provided with transportation to the chapel. Water bottles were also provided to devotees. The differently-abled people were taken on wheel chairs to venerate the relics. 
 
 Devotees in utter silence and prayerful mood venerated the two original sacred relics -a fragment of St Anthony's petrified flesh in a beautiful bust, and his smallest rib in a casket - that are brought from Rome, Italy. 
 
 Devotees were seen venerating the relics since early morning. Several deaneries, accompanied by their parish priests from different parishes across Bardez and  , also held masses. The veneration continued till late evening.
 
 "This is a good experience for us to strengthen our faith in this saint, and to have the relics here in Goa is really amazing," said a devotee. 
 
  Those who have missed this experience will get a another chance to venerate the relics on Saturday from 6 am to 10 am, that will be followed by a eucharistic celebration. The relics will then move to the Padre Pio Friary, Modi- Navelim. On Saturday an opening prayer will be held at 3pm followed by veneration between 3.15pm and 9pm. 
 
  On Sunday March 4, mass will be held at 6.30am followed by veneration from 7.45am till 12.30pm and from 1.30pm till 2.45pm.A thanksgiving mass will be held at 3pm.
