NAVI MUMBAI: A day after a seven-foot-long piece of discarded overhead equipment was placed on a CR railway track, four   were found on a track near  , on the  , on Thursday morning. This is the fourth suspected act of sabotage on railway tracks since January.

 Officials said that around 9.30 am, a gangman who was inspecting the tracks between Navade road railway station and Waldeshwar bridge, found four gelatin sticks, including a broken one, between the rails. Around 8-10 passenger trains pass through route in the morning hours.
 
 ACP (Panvel division) Prakash Nilewad said, “Gangman Bodhade immediately picked up the four gelatin sticks and kept them far away, near a nullah flowing parallel to the tracks. He alerted the Permanent Way Inspector (PWI), who, in turn, informed Kalamboli police. Subsequently, the Taloja police was informed at 12.30 pm, as the explosive material was found in their jurisdiction. An FIR under Section 4 of the   and Section 151(1) of the   has been registered against unknown accused persons.”
 
 Nilewad further said, “As there have been frequent incidents of suspected sabotage on railways tracks, the matter is being probed by multiple agencies such as the city police, RPF, GRP crime branch as well as the ATS and the IB. The gelatin sticks found on the tracks were apparently useless as they could not be blasted without detonators and batteries. Also, they were in a bad condition as they were soiled and seemed defunct. They have been sent for chemical analysis to confirm whether they are live.”
 
 Central Railway’s senior divisional security commissioner Sachin Balode said, “It seems like some miscreants are trying to create a scare. The gelatin sticks found are actually discarded explosives and cannot be exploded by simply keeping them on the tracks. They need detonating devices to blast them.”
