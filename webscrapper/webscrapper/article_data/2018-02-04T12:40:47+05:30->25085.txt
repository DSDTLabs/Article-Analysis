JAIPUR: Cradles set up in various government hospitals for abandoned children have proved to be a success and managed to save several children who may otherwise have been left on the streets or bushes.

 The idea was mooted to encourage safe abandoning of children. Over the past two years (from January 2016 till December 2017), 117 such children were abandoned in cradles of various government hospitals. Of these, 17 died from ailments. “It’s unfortunate that 17 infants have died. But we have succeeded in saving lives of 100 infants. Now, these children will be given up for adoption. We have handed over these infants to child welfare committees,” said Yog Guru Devendra Agarwal, state advisor,  .
 
 The state government’s network of 68 cradles is spread across the state. They have been placed in district hospitals, women’s hospitals, satellite hospitals and sub-district hospitals. The location to set up cradles was chosen strategically. “We identified a place in the hospital which is isolated so that a person can safely leave the baby in the cradle without being identified. There is an alarm in cradle, which begins to ring after a couple of minutes and alerts hospital authorities about the arrival of the baby,” Agarwal said.
 
 He said that these were infants who may have been abandoned on streets and bushes.
 
 As per data, 23 infants were abandoned safely in cradles in Jaipur division, 16 in Jodhpur division, 18 in Ajmer, 7 in Bharatpur, 6 in Bikaner, 11 in Kota and 36 in Udaipur.
 
 Officials said that there were various reasons for abandoning infants—some were unwanted, some discarded as they were girls, others as families could not afford to raise them.
