Pune: Rahul Banerjee, a scientist from CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL), Pune, has been awarded the B M Birla Science Prize for Chemistry 2015.

 He was presented the award, instituted by BM Birla Science Centre, Hyderabad, for developing a methodology of synthesizing porous covalent organic frameworks with exceptional chemical stability for gas storage and proton conduction. The work is a major breakthrough in porous material research, as these materials have the porosity and crystallinity of metal organic frameworks and also exceptional chemical stability of traditional porous zeolites or carbons.
 
 Banerjee joined CSIR-NCLâ€™s Physical and Materials Chemistry Division in 2008 after completing his postdoctoral work at the University of California, Los Angeles. He has published more than 120 research papers in international peer reviewed journals, including in top notch international journals, and has many citations to his credit.
 
 Banerjee is also the recipient of Humboldt Research Fellowship 2016, Thomson Reuters Research Excellence-India Citation Award 2015. He is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry.
