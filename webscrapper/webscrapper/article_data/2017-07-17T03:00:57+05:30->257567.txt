AGARTALA: The first round of talks between the state government and the agitating Indigenous Peoples’ Front of Twipra ( ) ended on an inconclusive note on Sunday, with outfit leaders not agreeing to withdraw the ongoing national highway and railway blockade.

 The outfit, fuelled by the government’s alleged apathy to indigenous people of  , has been agitating for a separate state of Twipraland. The indefinite blockade has paralysed life in the capital for the last seven days, with the   (NFR) having to divert several trains from   to Kolkata.
 
 The state government, citing the constitutional process of creating a new state, said only the Centre can take action in the matter. Officials also urged the agitators to withdraw the indefinite blockade. The IPFT delegation, however, said they will not relent until the state government initiates tripartite talks on the matter.
 
 “Until we know what transpires in Delhi we cannot withdraw the blockade unilaterally,” said IPFT chief NC Debbarma.
