BATHINDA: Former chief minister Parkash Singh   and Union food processing industry minister   Kaur Badal has demanded justice for the victims of 1984 anti-Sikh riots. While welcoming the Supreme Court order on setting up a new special investigation team to probe 186 such cases, Badal on Thursday said the deep wounds of Sikhs will not heal until the persons responsible for riots are not punished.

 Badal, who was in   on Thursday said, “Some   leaders are responsible for the riots and Sikh victims have been waiting for justice for over 33 years. Now, with the   order to set up an SIT our demand for justice has again been revived.”
 
 Badal also slammed the Punjab government for truncated loan waiver to farmers and said the government must provide benefits to all those who deserve and not selectively. Further, he said there was nothing wrong in organizing party rally on Maghi.
 
 Meanwhile, Harsimrat said the people who have any evidence against persons responsible for the killing innocent Sikhs in 1984 must appear before the new SIT whenever it is set up. She said, “We hope Sikhs will get the justice now.”
