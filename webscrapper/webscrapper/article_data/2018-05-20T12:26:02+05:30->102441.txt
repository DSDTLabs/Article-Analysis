BHUBANESWAR: In a smart move, the Bhubaneswar   Limited ( ) has started an e-office to pave way for paperless work in all smart city-related projects. The movement of soft files from bottom to top is now monitored on the screen. 

 The chief executive officer (CEO) of BSCL R Vineel Krishna inaugurated the office. Since the smart city office will be a hub that will see files coming from several departments, the e-office will save time that is consumed in physical movement of the files, said an official. 
 
 "Different departments work in convergence with BSCL. Mostly, the local civic body and   bring files for clearance and approval," said an officer of BSCL.
 
 In the long run, when other offices with smart city work set up e-offices, the work will be smoother and hassle-free, said the official. 
 
 "Now, the paperless work will be limited to the BSCL office. The various sections of BSCL, dealing with projects, will be able to see movement of files online. It can be tracked where a particular file is stuck and the reason can also be known," the official added.
 
 Krishna said, "The e-office would ensure transparency and lead to better coordination among departments."
 
 Another official said since the smart city would be a model for smart and healthy living, the e-office indirectly will help provide support to the green initiatives. 
 
 "Once the paperwork is curtailed, there won't be any need for huge dustbins. There won't be concern to preserve paper files in bulks. A lot of space can also be saved," the official said.
 
 A BSCL source said there are instances of files being stuck at clerical levels because of burden and forgetfulness. 
 
 "The e-office system will allow us to get alerts on a particular file and what is the level of urgency. It also lets us know the deadline of dispatching any letter or putting up a file," added the official.
