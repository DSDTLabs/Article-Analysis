NEW DELHI: Anna Hazare’s indefinite fast for various demands this time hasn’t drawn the crowds that marked his 2011 anti-corruption campaign for a lokpal. But a youth from West Bengal has bucked the trend to cycle all the way to the   here to meet his idol.

 Anna, sitting on a stage that can be accessed only by a few, too makes an exception for  , 27, who pedalled for 14 days from Barasat court in Bengal to get here, with only rest stops at dhabas and temples.
 
 Anna slowly stands up, raises his hands and says: “Yuva pidi swagat hain. Iss bachche ko dekhiye, yeh Kalkatta se cycle se aya hain (The youth are welcome. Look at this boy who has come all the way from Kolkata by cycle)”. Sourav then touches Anna’s feet amid the 200-300-strong crowd’s slogans of “Anna tum sangharsh karo, hum tumhare saath hain (Keep fighting Anna, we are with you).”
 
 “Lokpal, lokayukta and the situation of farmers are most important issues today. For these reasons, I came here to see Anna,” says Sourav, the son of a Kolkata Municipal Corporation employee, Utpal Lahiri. Anna is sitting on an indefinite hunger strike in solidarity with farmers’ demands and also to press for a lokpal and lokayuktas in states.
 
 This is not the first time Sourav has pedalled for a cause he believes in. The IGNOU history honours degree student had earlier travelled to Siliguri in north Bengal for environmental awareness, and also to Rabindranath Tagore’s Santiniketan to spread the message of peace, in the company of his only travel companion — his bicycle.
 
 “I went to Ralegan-Siddhi, Anna’s village, and was amazed to see how a man can be so simple in this technology-savvy era. He is the definition of a simple man in my dictionary,” said Sourav, who dreams of a corruption-free India.
