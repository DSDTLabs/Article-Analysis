Ranchi: In a bid to improve the   in the state capital, state urban development minister CP Singh, along with department secretary Arun Kumar Singh, director of   (SUDA) Rajesh Sharma and other officials, left for Mexico on Sunday on a  .

 Before leaving, Singh met deputy minister for mobility culture of Mexico, Alfredo Hernandez Raigoza, and under-secretary for transport planning, Jesùs Sànchez, the brains behind the metro bus of  , which is reportedly a huge success there. 
 
 Sing said, “This tour will help us to understand the design, construction and management of world-class streets which support and complement high-quality mass transit systems.”
 
 “The primary purpose of this tour is to learn about streets, planning and design of non-motorized transport (NMT) facilities and networks, bus rapid transit (BRT) systems, public cycle sharing systems (PCSS), inter-modal integration, parking management and congestion pricing,” he added. 
 
 Mexico City has a population of around eight million. However, despite the huge population, around 70% to 80% people depend on public transportation. To avoid traffic congestion, Mexico invested in a bus rapid transit system, metro bus, public bicycle sharing and has also improved the pedestrian infrastructure.
 
 However, like Ranchi, Mexico earlier too was dealing with problems of traffic congestion, poor accessibility, increased travel time and accident fatalities.
 
 Singh said, “The changes brought about in Mexico to improve the traffic can be a good example for Ranchi.”
 
 The study tour will also facilitate exchange of ideas, experience and challenges between the officials and politicians of the two cities in India and Mexico.
