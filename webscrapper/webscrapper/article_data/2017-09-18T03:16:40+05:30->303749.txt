NOIDA: A website has filed a complaint with Noida Police’s cyber cell against rape threat to its reporter after she posted a video criticising the rap song ‘Bolna aunty aau kya’. The complaint was filed by The   on September 16.

 The song, originally uploaded on YouTube in 2015, gained new-found fame last month after an event was organised in Connaught Place, encouraging people to gather and sing ‘Bolna aunty aau kya’. The video had over 3 million views, 30,000 likes and 60,000 dislikes before it was taken off by YouTube recently.
 
 Quint said that on September 14, its reporter published a video criticising rapper Omprakash Mishra’s viral song and termed it sexist and misogynistic. The website alleged that Mishra and his fans have been attacking Quint’s Facebook pages – Quint, Quint Neon, and its journalist on social media platforms since then.
 
 “The reporter who made the video got two death threats on her personal WhatsApp number. Her personal page on Facebook is flooded with sexual abuses and rape threats,” the website said in a complaint.
 
 Some miscreants also created a Facebook page urging people to visit Quint’s office in Noida in Sector 16A on September 22 and sing the same song en masse. Quint has demanded suitable action against the accused and sought safety of the company office and the correspondent.
 
 YouTube has withdrawn the rap song over copyright issue. “It was due to a copyright issue and not due to any action Quint had taken,” an official of The Quint said. The Quint has also taken down its critical video because of unprecedented online abuse.
 
 Arun Kumar Singh, SP (city), Noida said the cyber cell is looking into the matter. “We will take suitable action based on the complaint,” he told TOI.
