New Delhi: Local shopping complexes across   will remain closed on Friday in   against the ongoing   drive being carried out on the directions of the SC-empowered monitoring committee. The   that will take part in the bandh include those at Defence Colony, Hauz Khas, Green Park Extension, South Extension I and II and Greater Kailash I and II.

 Rajender Sharda, who heads GK-I M-Block market traders’ association, said, “All market associations met under the umbrella of Federation of LSC and decided to down shutters on Friday. This is our protest against the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty created due to random sealing drives. We appeal to   and political parties not to take any immediate action. Documents must first be properly analysed to identify the culprits. Our businesses will be destroyed now that basements are being sealed.”
 
 The general secretary of Defence Colony market, Jagdish Gupta, said that their only option now is to keep the markets closed. “No one wants to shut his business, but we don’t have other option. No one is paying heed to our issues. The monitoring committee is not even allowing traders to meet them. Even the corporation has passed the buck to the committee,” he added.
 
 However, the general secretary of Hauz Khas E-Block market, Manmohan Singh, said they are yet to take a call on the bandh. “We haven’t faced any major problems as yet,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, the sealing drive continued on Thursday in four of the six zones of north corporation. “In New Rajinder Nagar on Shankar Road (Karol Bagh), 18 units in nine properties were sealed on the directions of the monitoring committee. A total of 34 units were sealed in Indira Market and sabzi mandi in Malka Ganj,” the north corporation spokesperson said.
 
 “While two outlets were sealed in Rohini zone, 18 were closed in Karol Bagh, 34 in Civil Lines and 33 in City-Sadar Paharganj zone,” the spokesperson added.
