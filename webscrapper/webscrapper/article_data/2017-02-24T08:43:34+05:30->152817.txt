CHENNAI: Social activist  , who is credited with filing umpteen PILs on various social and political issues, has moved the Madras high court to declare last Saturday's confidence motion moved by the Edappadi K Palaniswami government as null and void. 

 A bench of acting chief justice Huluvadi G Ramesh and Justice R Mahadevan adjourned further hearing of the case by a week, so that it could be heard along with similar PILs filed by DMK working president M K Stalin and Advocates Forum for Social Justice president and advocate K Balu. All these PILs will come up for hearing on February 27.
 
 Ramaswamy said the speaker had committed an error by rejecting the opposition parties' plea to have secret ballot while voting on the confidence motion moved by chief minister Palaniswami. Following the alleged confinement of AIADMK MLAs at a resort in Koovathur, a secret ballot was necessary, Ramaswamy said.
 
 He wanted the motion to be declared illegal, null and void, and sought a fresh exercise keeping in mind the allegations of confinement of MLAs.
 
 The high court has already asked Stalinâ€™s counsel to submit the assembly clippings in support of his version of the assembly proceedings.
