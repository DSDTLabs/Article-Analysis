HYDERABAD: The   (TDP) has demanded that chief minister   provide details about how Rs5 lakh crore were spent in the state in the last four years. “Budgets are presented and allocations are made. Since another budget is going to be presented, people should know how much has actually been spent and for what,” said TDP politburo member  .

 The TDP leader wondered why the state government was taking loans for irrigation projects when KCR had himself declared that   was rich and financially sound. “The talk about developing the state has been big, but the reality is different on the ground,” he said.
 
 
 Chandrasekhar Reddy also said it had come to their notice that there was a freeze in spending by the government and even salaries were being denied to certain sections. “This only means that there is a financial emergency. It goes to show that government is not managing finances well. This is the only impression one gets,” he said.
 
 The TDP leader also demanded to know how much the state government had allocated for the Kaleshwaram project in the last two years and how much was actually spent. He said the spending was far less than what has been allocated as funds had not been released. “The government is forming corporations only with the intention of borrowing money through them and also providing political facility for some to enjoy power and privileges,” he charged.
 
 Chandrasekhar Reddy dismissed rumours about him joining the Congress. “The   too is playing mind games like the TRS. I am in TDP and will never leave the party,” he said in reply to a question.
