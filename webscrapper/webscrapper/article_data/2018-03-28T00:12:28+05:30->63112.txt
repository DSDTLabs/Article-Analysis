Khargone: A local Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader has been   for raping a girl for past two years on pretext of marriage.

 Barwaha police station in-charge Shashikant Chaurasia told TOI that an 18-year-old girl had lodged a complaint against the accused Unik Surana, alleging that he had befriended her some two years ago and had sexually abused her on various occasions after promising her that he would marry her. 
 
 On Sunday night, when she was watching Ram Navmi procession with her sister, Unik came to meet her and asked her to accompany him. She then asked him to marry her as per his promise, but he refused and even threatened to share a video of their intimate moments on social media.
 
 Hearing this, the girl and her sister beat him up and later lodged a complaint with the police. The accused, fearing that he might be arrested, fled from there.
 
 Chaurasia said that statement of the girl has been recorded under section 164 of the CrPc before Barwaha judicial magistrate first class. “A case was registered against Unik on Monday under sections 190 (threat to injury), 376 ( ), 506 (criminal intimidation of the IPC and relevant section of POCSO and several teams were formed to look for him,” the police official said.
 
 The accused is cousin of BJP district general secretary. Barwaha BJP mandal president Ashok Tewari told TOI that the party has called up a meeting to discuss the issue
