BENGALURU: JD(S) state president and chief ministerial candidate   gave an emotional twist to his final day campaign on Thursday: “If you want to see me alive, make me win.”

 Participating in a roadshow at Laggere in   constituency on Thursday, Kumaraswamy reminded voters about his health issues and said: “Despite all constraints, I have been working tirelessly to secure 113 seats and bring the JD(S) to power. If you want your Kumaranna to be alive, please make us win. If you save me by ensuring my victory, I will save you. Only you have the strength to save me and I am ready to work for you. If our candidates win, we will win.”
 
 Kumaraswamy also pleaded helplessness in mobilising funds for his candidates. “Everyone is asking for money. Where do I get money for the candidates? I have to raise donations and fund my candidates.” He recounted that several farmers and students had contributed their savings to JD(S).
 
 Earlier in the day, Kumaraswamy cancelled his media interaction as he was suffering from fever and cough. Though he was advised rest, he chose to campaign in   constituency, where his friend-turned-foe Zameer Ahmed Khan is challenging JD(S).
 
 Kumaraswamy also explained his absence from Ramanagara and Channapatna constituencies where he is contesting, to his voters. “I could not come as I was touring other parts of the state. But I will come back to you as your leader soon,” he tweeted.
