THANE: Even as the official   for the pre-monsoon nullah cleaning work came to an end of Thursday, the Thane municipal corporation ( ) said that it is yet to complete almost 30% of the work. 

 The TMC had begun the drive early this year but work is still pending. This came to light on Wednesday when TMC chief Sanjeev Jaiswal carried out an inspection here. 
 
 The civic officials have, however, assured residents that the work will end by June 3, which is a Sunday. 
 
 Civic officials had visited a few of the bigger nullahs in the lake city located near Batata company on Ghodbunder Road, Shrirang society, Majiwada, Kapurbawdi and many more. 
 
 While the one at Batata Company and near Shrirang society was relatively cleaner, the nullah at Majiwada was still filled with garbage and mud.
 
 A civic official said, “The nullah cleaning work at Vartak Nagar, Lokmanya Nagar, Wagle Estate and Savarkar Nagar has almost been completed. Only the ones at Hardas Nagar, Samrat Nagar in Mumbra and Samata Nagar are yet to be cleaned. The drainage work carried out at Samata Nagar is causing the delay but it should be complete in the next three days. Work is going on in full swing. If required, another round of cleaning will be conducted after the first showers hit the city as the nullahs will again be accumulated with mud.”
 
 The Rs 6 crore project aimed at cleaning and desilting 58 big nullahs for which tenders were invited in end of April began on May 6.
