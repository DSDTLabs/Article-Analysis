AHMEDABAD: The issue of Pandoli   has once again reached Gujarat   with one Jeevan Raut, brother of main accused and absconder, Dr Santosh alias  , questioning Anand police’s investigation into charges under the provisions of   (THOA).

 Earlier on Raut’s petition, the HC had ruled that police do not have powers to investigate the charges under THOA, but it can go ahead with the probe in connection with the IPC charges on basis of the FIR.
 
 Raut has complained that despite the legal position being very much clear that only special authority appointed by the state government can probe THOA charges, police have continued to investigate the same.
 
 On the petition to restrain police from probing THOA charges further, HC has kept hearing on April 5.
