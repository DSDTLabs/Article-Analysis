RAIPUR: Ancient  , known by the sobriquet "  of  " , needs immediate conservation as cracks have developed on the structure and few portions, including the sanctum sanctorum, is facing the threat of waterlogging.

 The 11th century Bhoramdeo temple has already developed cracks, leading to water seepage and even leakage at some places during rainy season. Last rainy season, rain water dripped from the ceiling into the sanctum sanctorum.
 
 State department of art and culture director   told TOI "I have visited the temple and found that continuous offering of raw rice, milk and water to Lord Shiva at the temple also leads to water retention below the plinth. Besides, it is also causing dampness that could damage the ancient structure". He said instructions have already been issued to stop offering water, rice and milk at the temple.
 
 Octogenarian archaeologist and state's archaeological advisor Arun Sharma told TOI ". I had visited Bhoramdeo temple about five months ago and found many issues that threaten the existence of the ancient temple. It's a XI th century temple constructed during   dynasty and is one of the most valuable ancient heritages for us". Around the ancient temple, there are three small temples surrounded by trees. A big tree near the temple is also causing harm to the temple, which has already tilted towards a side.
