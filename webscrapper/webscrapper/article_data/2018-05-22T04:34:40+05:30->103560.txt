Differences surfaced between them ahead of the assembly polls in 2017. 

 Bambhania, along with nine other members of the community, made the statement at the commission’s office in   in the secretariat, Gandhinagar. “Before any representations are made, the Patidar community would like to know from this commission...the terms of reference which suggest that at the end of the inquiry, the commission may have to make recommendations suggesting preventive measures for the recurrence of such incident(s),” the statement submitted by Bambhania reads. “...if that is so, this commission is not the commission of inquiry so as to suggest actions to be taken against erring officers of the state government but it is only an attempt to cover up atrocities committed by the police.” 
 
 The statement further reads, “It is an experience of the public of   that the Government of Gujarat has formed the habit to appoint an inquiry commission, spend huge public money on such a commission, and keep the report submitted by such a commission in the cupboard.” The statement says that the Patidars “apprehend the same fate for the report if it is submitted by the commission.”
 
 The Gujarat government had in October last year announced the formation of the commission.
