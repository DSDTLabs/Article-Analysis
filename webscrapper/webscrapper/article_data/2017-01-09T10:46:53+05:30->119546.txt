HYDERABAD: The Union health ministry may have taken a decision to conduct  , but medical aspirants from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are faced with the problem of shortage of study material.
Though majority of students choose English as medium of the examination, students, who had studied in state-run schools may prefer Telugu over English, some experts said. However, unlike English books, which are easily available in the market, there is a shortage of study material for NEET in Telugu.
 
 “Before taking such a decision, the   (CBSE) should have made sure that resources are available to those willing to appear for NEET in regional languages. Shortage of textbooks in Telugu will be a disability for medical aspirants,“ said Lax mi  , president of Private Medical and Dental College Managements Association in Telangana. Students preferring to take up NEET in Telugu have to heavily depend on books published by the Telugu Akademi. It is not just shortage of textbooks but difference in syllabus is also proving to be a major disadvan tage for medical aspirants in Telangana and AP .“Apart from lack of resources, there is a vast difference between   recommended for NEET and the state-board syllabus. Lack of question papers and mock tests in Telugu will be another handicap for students studying in government junior colleges in various districts of Telangana. Therefore, it is advisable for students to appear in English medium even if they are comfortable in Telugu,“ advised  , regional director (operations), South Zone for Aakash Educational Services Pvt. Ltd.
