PATNA: Bihar is sort of missing from the  , regretted at least two native economists on Wednesday.

 “A visibly happy PM   looked favourably disposed to Bihar when he came to Patna to attend Prakashotsava recently. We, therefore, expected the Budget to propose additional incentives for the state. However, we have got none,” academic D M Diwakar said, terming, however, the increase in allocation for agriculture sector as a welcome step for an agrarian state like ours.
 
 The   Institute of Social Studies further said the reduction in allocation for flood and irrigation management is a bad news for Bihar which faces the double whammy of floods and drought almost every year.
 
 Asian Development Research Institute’s member-secretary Shaibal Gupta pointed out the I-T rate rejig proposed in the Budget would mean a benefit of a meagre Rs 12,500 for people earning Rs 2.5 to 5 lakh per annum.
 
 “That further calculates to Rs 1,000 per month, which is no relief if compared to the current rate of inflation,” Gupta said and opined the I-T rates should have been restructured for all income slabs.
 
 He also regretted the absence of any proposal for tackling the economic slowdown caused by the demonetisation. “And Bihar is completely missing from the Budget this time. It neither makes mention of any special package or special status for Bihar nor speaks about any individual project for the state,” said the social scientist.
