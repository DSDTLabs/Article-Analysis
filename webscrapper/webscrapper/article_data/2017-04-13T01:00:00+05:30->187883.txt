Haven’t been blessed with a flawless complexion? Regularly suffer from skin breakouts especially before important events? Depend on the apps on your smartphone to improve the appearance of your skin in pictures? Let   come to your rescue. There are certain things, though, that you need to keep in mind while using a foundation so that it lasts for hours... 

 1. Your foundation serves as a base for the make-up that you will use later, so make sure you apply it well. Your skin needs to be well hydrated before you slap on the foundation, so spend some time applying a face oil, serum or moisturiser. This will ensure that your base is perfect. 
 
 2. The next step is to spritz on some face mist or even rose water that will lock in what you’re applying on the skin. This also works like a primer and will instantly give you a glow. 
 
 3. Make sure you don’t apply a   before you use your foundation. While most women tend to do it the other way around, concealing your acne, spots and dark circles first results in lesser usage of the foundation. You won’t end up looking like you’re applied a hundred layers of make-up this way, too. 
 
 4. You’d think that the next step would be to apply foundation. However, before that you need to apply some cream  . This will give you a natural-looking flush instead of an illusion of having applied too much make-up.
 
 5. Next, use a small damp sponge in a circular motion to apply the foundation. If you don’t have one, use your fingertips to gently blend it in. 
 
 6. The last step is to ensure that your make-up doesn’t crease. Use a   and some loose powder and very gently apply it on the oily areas of your face. Remember, you have to apply just the bare minimum to complete your look.
