Nagpur: With the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting extreme summers this year, the regional met department has already recorded hottest February of the decade in Yavatmal and Buldhana districts of Vidarbha. Officials warn of tough times ahead for farmers and people living in drought-prone areas. According to the seasonal forecast released by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the average temperatures from March to May are likely to be above normal by more than 1 degree Celsius in almost half of the country including Vidarbha. “Last year, the average temperatures were 0.5 degree Celsius above the normal. A further increase of 0.5 degree Celsius is very significant for the climate system,” said AD Tathe, director of Regional Meteorological Centre, Nagpur.  While the maximum and minimum temperatures of February did not break any records in Nagpur, Yavatmal and Buldhana on February 28, recorded highest maximum temperatures of the month in the last ten years. “Both districts broke the records with the mercury soaring to 37 degree Celsius on Wednesday,” said Tathe. Before this, the highest maximum temperature of 36.5 degree Celsius was recorded in Yavatmal on February 20, 2016. In Buldhana, the earlier highest maximum temperature was also 36.5 degree Celsius recorded on February 29, 2016, informed Tathe. The weather system evolving in Central India are conducive for rising temperatures. “Due to anti-cyclonic conditions, absence of advection of cool air and no moisture availability from Arabian Sea or Bay of Bengal, the region is experiencing high temperatures,” said Tathe. The regional met department has promptly alerted the state government as well as civic authorities to gear up for adverse weather conditions this summer. Regions like Marathwada and Latur, that face perennial water shortage, might need extra attention to face the ordeal. As per the warning, farmers of the region should also be prepared for the scorching heat.
