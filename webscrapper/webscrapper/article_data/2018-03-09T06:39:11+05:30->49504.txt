HYDERABAD: The   in India has requested external affairs ministry and Telangana government to help its national Masood Yaqub get custody of his three children, lodged at different state-run homes. Delhi-based Afghan national Yaqub’s wife Niloufer deserted him, came to the city with their children and married mechanic Jalaluddin Akbar. She fraudulently obtained Aadhaar cards and other identity proofs for herself and her children. Cyberabad police had traced her after Masood’s complaint.

 Niloufer was arrested by Rajendranagar police in February for illegally obtaining ID proofs. In a letter dated February 28, 2018, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan sought help from MEA and Telangana government. “Masood approached this Embassy stating that his children are in Hyderabad without any caretaker and requested us to take up the issue of giving him custody of his children. The esteemed ministry is kindly requested to look into the matter and provide necessary assistance to Masood,” an Afghanistan official said in the letter.
 
 Akbar obtained bail, while Niloufer is in   jail. On Thursday, Masood visited Niloufer in jail to settle disputes, but she refused to meet him. When he went to see his children, they too did not evince interest. He could meet them but they were scared. “Niloufer influenced the children. I want custody of my children,” Masood told
