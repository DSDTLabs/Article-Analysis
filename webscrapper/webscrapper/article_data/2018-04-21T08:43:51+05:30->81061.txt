CHANDIGARH: An eight-year-old girl belonging to the tribal Gadia Lohar community was kidnapped, raped and brutalised in a village near   town,  , on Wednesday night. However, before the case came to light and an FIR registered on Thursday, the child, who was bleeding and whose clothes were torn, and her family were sent back by a hospital with just a painkiller, it has been alleged.

 Police are yet to identify the accused. On Tuesday night, it has been alleged, the girl was sleeping with her mother at the tribe’s camp on the outskirts of the village, when a person allegedly gagged and took away the girl. Her father was also sleeping in the hut.
 
 Around 11pm, the girl’s uncle spotted her near the camp, on the   road. He took her to the family and they rushed her to the hospital. However, doctors at   hospital allegedly sent them back after giving her a painkiller.
 
 The incident came to light on Thursday morning, when the family approached the sarpanch of a nearby village. He informed the police and police got the girl admitted to Hansi civil hospital. Hansi superintendent of police (SP)   confirmed that the girl was subjected to sexual abuse. “We are working on the case from all angles. We are interacting with the girl’s parents to get some more details. She is recovering and will be counselled as well,” said the SP.
 
 The SP said they had pressed multiple teams into action and were also taking the help of the police’s cyber cell. Earlier, a six-year-old girl was raped and killed after being subjected to sexual abuse on the outskirts of Uklana town of Hisar in November 2017. The girl was kidnapped from near her mother. Later, her body was recovered near the boundary wall of a telephone exchange.
