NEW DELHI: The   on Monday formed two committees — one to look into the issue of   in   products and suggest changes in the related laws, and the other to find ways to check   on PWD roads.

 The first committee was formed after AAP MLA   drew the attention of the House towards his claims that synthetic milk is being supplied in the city, which is dangerous for kidney and liver.
 
 Health minister   ordered the department to inspect milk products and submit reports every day. Jain said people involved in these activities were not scared as “actions are not being taken against the majority of them”. 
 
 The committee will comprise of AAP’s Adarsh Shastri, Alka Lamba, Anil Bajpai, Nitin Tyagi and Madan Lal and BJP’s Manjinder Sirsa. 
 
 During the discussion for an anti-encroachment committee, Jain, who is also the PWD minister, said the department didn’t have the power to remove encroachment even on its own roads, and the corporations were supposed to remove them. Finally, a five-member committee was formed to find ways to solve the problem.
 
 The assembly also passed a resolution moved by AAP MLAs Madan Lal and Som Dutt to seek powers to pay lawyers hired to present the side of a House committee in case of any dispute.
