Vijayawada: City   have raised concerns over the new proposals to bring them into tax net in the finance bill 2018. The Union government has proposed to calculate the income of the lorries according to the Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW). According to the new proposal, the income of the lorries will be calculated as Rs 1,000 per month per every tonne of the GVW. This is only applicable to the vehicles with more than 12 tonnes GVW.

 Lorry owners are opposing this rule saying it will be detrimental to bring all owners under the tax net, and are planning to go on a strike. General secretary of Andhra Pradesh Lorry Owners Association (APLOA), YV Eswar Rao said that a 12-tyre vehicle has a GVW of 25 tonnes. If the income is calculated as per the new rules, owner of a single lorry will have to pay income tax for Rs 50,000 after the personal income exemption of Rs 2.5 lakh, irrespective of the income earned.
 
 Rao also faulted the method of calculating the tax based on GVW, instead of the payload. “We are paid for the transportation of the payload only, and not for the vehicle. It is atrocious to impose tax on the lorry’s weight.”
 
 The lorry owners associations has demanded that the proposed I-T rules in the Union budget not be implemented, and that the current system be continued.
 
 Krishna District Lorry Owners Association (KDLOA) general secretary, Adusumilli Sadasiva Rao, said the Union government has reduced excise duty on diesel by Rs 8, but imposed same amount of road cess without transferring the benefit of diesel price reduction to the end customer. “Now, imposing income tax on lorry owners will be detrimental to the industry.
 
 KDLOA president Koneru Venkata Rama Rao said the industry was negatively affected by the roll out of GST. “We have been demanding reduction on the tax slab on lubricants and spare parts from 28% to 12%. Now, the changes in I-T rules will leave us no choice but to quit the business,” he said.
