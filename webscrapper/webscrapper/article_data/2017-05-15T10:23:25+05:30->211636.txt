BENGALURU: JD(S) state president   on Sunday visited the new president of  , Prakash Iyengar, triggering speculation about the party attempting social engineering. 

  Kumaraswamy told the media that Iyengar was an old friend and that the visit was to congratulate him for being elected the organization's new president. "I have also sought his support for the party and my future endeavours," Kumaraswamy said, hinting at a social engineering of Brahmins and Vokkaligas for the upcoming 2018 assembly elections. 
 
 Asked whether Iyengar is going to officially join the JD(S), he said the decision will be taken by the latter and his supporters. "When the time is right, he will announce the same," he added. 
 
  With the Lingayats expected to back the BJP with B S   and the Ahinda (Kannada acronym for the backward classes, minorities and dalits) the Congress, it seems a forced choice for the Vokkaliga-based JD(S) to woo the Brahmins who have been traditionally associated with the BJP. Under the undivided Janata Parivar, Ramakrishna Hegde, a Brahmin, was the CM in 1983. 
 
  Kumaraswamy also alleged that the BJP is hypocritical when it comes to tackling corruption. "While the BJP is using a recent report that Karnataka government is the most corrupt, the state unit of the party is projecting B S Yeddyurappa as their CM candidate. Yeddyurappa was criticized for bringing corruption to the BJP, in a public forum, by his own colleague and now Union minister D V Sadananda Gowda when the latter was CM in 2013," said Kumaraswamy.
