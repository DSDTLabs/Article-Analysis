When   actor Naga   decided to go ‘all in’ with his career by bankrolling his film Chalo, there were many in the industry who felt that the young man should have been playing safe. Little did they know that   was the royal flush that he had been waiting for all along. Not only has the film been doing extremely well at the ticket window, more importantly for the actor, it’s a vindication of his judgement. “There were many occasions in the past when I felt that my characterisation in a film was not apt. But I chose to stay silent out of respect for the makers. Later, when the film released, I’d realise that my fears were valid. Yet, I had to take the blame as the film was riding on my name. Even my parents felt that I was not being portrayed the way audiences wanted to see me on screen. So when Chalo came my way, I backed it completely and I’m extremely happy with the way things have turned out,” says Naga Shaurya.
For Naga Shaurya, the happiness of his parents brings even more satisfaction. “Everyone is calling them and saying they loved the film. They don’t say much, but i know they are proud of me. it’s kind of ironic when you consider the fact that they were the ones who backed my judgement and took the risk by producing my film. I’m happy at the success of our production house because if it does well, a lot of families will do well,” says Shaurya, who is currently on a success tour of the film in Rayalaseema. When asked about the biggest takeaway from Chalo, the actor says, “It has connected me with the mass audience. Till now, they have associated me with family entertainers and urban love stories. Chalo has given me the kind of break I was looking for.” 
 Produced by   and presented by   under Ira Creations, Chalo is running successfully in theatres.
