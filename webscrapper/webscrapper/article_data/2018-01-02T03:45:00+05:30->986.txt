Visakhapatnam: Hundreds of motorists were booked for drunken driving over the two-day weekend on December 30 and December 31 by city traffic cops, who have also created a record by registering the highest number of drunken driving cases in a single day so far.

 Traffic cops said they booked 638 cases on the night of December 31 (Sunday) alone. The high number of cases comes despite wide publicity by the   that they would not go soft on drunken driving.
 
 Traffic cops said they registered 321 cases of drunken driving on the night of December 30. The last two days of 2017 witnessed 959 cases in all. Most of the cases are expected to go to court. Last year, more than 440 persons were convicted by the courts and were handed jail terms ranging from one day to 15 days for driving over the limit.
 
 City traffic cops with the help of the law and order wing and crime wing conducted tests at 50 major junctions in the city as against the normal 20 to 25 core areas in the city. Police even conducted alco meter tests at Lankelapalem, Parawada, Madhurwada and other outskirt areas. 
 
 “Our aim is not confined to drunken driving tests, but visibility of policing, so that no one indulge in any illegal activity. We succeeded as the New Year was ushered in largely incident-free,” traffic ACP Kinjarpu Prabhakar said 
 
 “Most people confined themselves to their homes and partied with friends and relatives. Their liquor parties were within four walls. With cooperation from the people, we did our jobs with ease,” a traffic cop said.
