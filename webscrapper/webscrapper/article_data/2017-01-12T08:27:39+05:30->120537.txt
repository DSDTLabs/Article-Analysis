LUDHIANA: With the nomination filing procedure to start from Wednesday, BJP aspirants are still waiting for the ticket announcement. The long wait for the announcement of their names in the list of contesting candidates is giving them sleepless nights. 

 During his visit to the city, state BJP president Vijay Sampla had claimed that the names would be declared by January 8 but as that the date has passed, it has caused tension among the ticket hopefuls. Now they would get less time for campaigning. The aspirants had even gone to Delhi for presenting their case before the senior leaders. 
 
 The party is yet to announce its candidates for three constituencies (north, west and central) in the city. There is a tough competition among BJP leaders for getting the tickets. In North, Parveen Bansal and RD Sharma have showed interest to contest the elections. Bansal had contested assembly elections in 2012 also but he had lost to Rakesh Pandey of the Congress. Sharma is deputy mayor in Ludhiana municipal corporation. 
 
 However, in central constituency Satpal Gosain, Dr Subhash Verma and   are keen to fight elections. With Sampla given a hint that age factor would be considered while giving tickets, chances of Satpal Gosain have become mild and now fight is between Verma and Deby. Sources revealed that in the west constituency, the party is considering the name of businessman Rakesh Kapoor while senior BJP leader   is also in the fray. 
 
 BJP leader and chairman of the   DR  , "We are eagerly waiting for the announcement of tickets. We will accept party decision no matters who will get the ticket."
 
 Similarly another BJP leader and former senior deputy mayor Parveen Bansal said name of the candidates would be announced most likely by January 11 and the decision of the party would be acceptable to all. He added that they were ready to give a tough fight to other candidates if given a chance.
