BHOPAL: The state   on Friday took serious objection to the chief election officer (CEO) Salina Singh’s remarks that the photo showing   candidate Brijendra Singh Yadav taking blessings of a woman during election campaign in Mungaoli, and a man next to him offering her money, does not indicate any bait. BJP leaders said that they will complain to the Chief Election Commissioner O P Rawat in Delhi.

 “We lodged a complaint with photo evidence against Congress candidate Brijendra Singh Yadav distributing money to voters during electioneering in Mungaoli on Thursday. In normal course the matter should have been investigated and action taken against Yadav. But the very next day, CEO Salina Singh, while talking to reporters, jumped to the conclusion that the photo could not establish the Congress leader wooing a voter,” said BJP state general secretary Ajay Pratap Singh on Friday. 
 
 On Thursday, BJP leaders had submitted a memorandum to the CEO demanding action against Yadav for alleged violation of model code of conduct. The BJP demanded an investigation and that the “evidence” provided by the ruling party be verified before reaching any conclusion.
 
 “Congress worker Chandrapal Bais, who accompanied Brijendra Singh Yadav, and distributed money to voters had in his statement admitted that he gave money to the woman carrying a pot as a mark of ‘good omen’, . How could CEO deny this outright? The CEO cannot be CJI who is delivering a judgment,” said BJP state spokesperson Rajnish Agrawal.
 
 BJP Rajya Sabha member Prabhat Jha has also demanded to disqualify Congress candidate Yadav for offering bait to a voter. “There is evidence of Congress leaders distributing money and action should be taken immediately. Jyotiraditya Scindia’s candidate was trapped while distributing money to voters. I had informed central observer Rajesh Kumar.   should disqualify Yadav,” said Jha.
