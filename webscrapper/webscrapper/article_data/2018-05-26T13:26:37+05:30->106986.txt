 is missing Srabanti. Well, before you start reading too much between the lines, hear it from Ankush himself: “It is so much fun shooting for Dance Bangla Dance Junior with   and   (U Sengupta). I tease her so much that at times the director has to intervene. Whatever Srabanti wears, Jisshuda and I would comment on it. Obviously, she gets angry. We keep pulling her leg. It is Jisshuda, who plays pranks but I get beaten up by Srabanti. I must say Jisshuda, Srabanti and I are best of friends and we look forward to meeting on the sets.”
