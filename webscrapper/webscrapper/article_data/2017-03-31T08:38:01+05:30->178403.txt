PANAJI: The Congress, on Thursday, poked fun at the fortnight-old   government saying that the BJP government was already taking   to fool the people. Claiming that differences had arisen between Parrikar and Goa Forward MLA and town and country planning minister   over the implementation of the  , Congress demanded that Parrikar tender an apology.

 Five days after Parrikar, in his state budget, said that Regional Plan 2021 would be implemented by December 2017, Sardesai suggested that it was not possible to implement the Regional Plan 2021 in the next nine months and hinted about the formulation of Regional plan 2031.
 
 “Whom should they believe in? This clearly indicates that the BJP-led government is all set to start a five-year long tenure of U-turns which can be called as ‘U-turns within U-turn’. The people of Goa have been listening about the regional plan and its deadlines for more than five years. The recent division between Parrikar and Sardesai on the regional plan has now made it clear that Goa will not have a land use plan, at least for next five years,” Congress spokesperson and AICC secretary   said.
 
 The Congress party also considers the difference of opinion between Parrikar and Sardesai as breach of the House as, ‘the budget document placed on the floor of the House is sacrosanct’.
