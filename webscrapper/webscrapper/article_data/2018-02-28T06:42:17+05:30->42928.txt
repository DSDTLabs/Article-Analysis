MUMBAI: In an  ,   on Tuesday protected an Andheri   from being dispossessed of their home over Rs 58 lakh bank loan arrears.

 A division bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and Vijay Achliya told the petitioner he could seek relief before the Debt Recovery Tribunal.
 
 Avinash Shingnapurkar, 48, whose digital business went bust last year, stood to lose his 1BHK flat in Andheri to a bank under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act.
 
 Shingnapurkar had claimed that while big firms had bad debts of over Rs 7.6 lakh crore, and some of the defaulters have been allowed to leave the country, small traders unable to pay because of genuine difficulties face the prospect of losing their homes.
 
 He had challenged section 14 of SARFAESI Act, which allows dispossession of a borrower on an application by the bank without giving a hearing to the affected parties. “The court can ask the Centre to consider the plight of small businessmen and professionals whose loans are classified as NPAs and they are thrown out of their homes,” said advocate Mathews Nedumpara, counsel for Shingnapurkar.
