  About 45 families in Dildarnagar, which trace their lineage to Deendar, coexist with Hindu pattidars-the Rajputs who did not convert during the Mughal reign. The village is a symbol of Hindu-Muslim bonhomie. Communal issues like ghar wapsi, love jihad, and kabaristan-shamshaan remarks have failed to make inroads here. 
 
 Deendar's ancestors hailed from Samhauta village in Kaimur district of Bihar, about 45 km from Ghazipur. Pattidar Shivji Singh, 82, a retired school headmaster, lives in Samhauta. "We long to be with our extended family in Ghazipur. We have many scriptures and documents which establish that Nawal was picked from Samhauta in the 17th century by a commander of the Mughal army and taken to Lahore. Nawal converted and later settled in Dildarnagar, which was then a Muslim settlement," shares Shivji. 
 
 Both Muslim and Rajput families in Dildarnagar are in possession of various documents written in Urdu and Persian, including a letter of adoption of Nawal signed by the Emperor Aurangzeb. 
 
 Nasim Raza Khan is a 10th generation descendant of Deendar Khan. He shows books and documents on family's history. "We accepted Islam and practise it. But at the same time we equally respect Hindu religious beliefs. Our ceremonies are not held unless Hindu pattidars from Samhauta are taken into confidence," says Nasim. 
 
 Village pradhan Mohammad Ehsan Ahmed, 45, sought a museum in the name of Deendar in the village which has a population of 35,000. 
 
 The museum was sanctioned by Om Prakash Singh, local MLA and tourism minister in SP government. It will be built on a mound believed to Deendar's erstwhile kothi.
