PANAJI: The liver harvested from B Sadashiv Rao, a 60-year-old donor declared brain-dead, was successfully transplanted at the Global Hospital in Parel, Mumbai, chief clinical officer of Manipal Hospital, Dona Paula, Dr Shekhar Salkar, said. The surgery was performed by the chief liver transplant surgeon at Global Hospital, Dr Ravi Mohanka. 

  
  
 
 “Dr Mohanka has confirmed that the graft liver perfused well and the recipient is doing well in post-operative care,” Salkar said.
 
 In medical terms, successful perfusion of any transplanted organ means that a good blood supply and flow of blood through the organ have been achieved.
 
 Rao was admitted to Manipal Hospital after he suffered a brain haemorrhage. His family members decided to donate his organs after he was declared brain-dead. The Mumbai-based Regional Organ and   (ROTTO) was informed, and team of doctors arrived in Goa to harvest the organs.
 
 Rao’s kidneys were donated to Bombay Hospital and   for use in other recipients. The kidney transplant was scheduled for Saturday. 
 
 Kidneys harvested for transplant have a preservation time of up to 72 hours.
 
 The Goa Police had created a green corridor on Friday afternoon to help doctors to transport Rao’s kidneys and liver from Dona Paula to   airport, a distance of 30 km, in record time of 24 minutes. The organs were immediately flown on a chartered aircraft to Mumbai for transplant procedures.
