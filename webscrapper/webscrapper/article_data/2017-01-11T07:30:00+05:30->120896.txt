AMRITSAR: With just 24 days to go, all major political parties appear to be in wait and watch mode before announcing the names of their candidates for the   byelection. Taking the lead on Tuesday, former state convener of   (AAP) Sucha Singh Chhotepur, who had formed   (APP), announced the name of his confidant   as his party’s candidate for Amritsar Lok Sabha bypoll.

 In September 2016, Bajwa had resigned along with 85 office-bearers from AAP’s primary membership in support of Chhotepur protesting against the alleged interference of outsider observers of the party in Punjab.
 
 Talking to TOI, Bajwa said he would concentrate on the issues of drug addiction, unemployment and corruption which had played havoc to the youth of state. Informing that B R Ambedakr’s grandson Parkash Ambedkar-led   would be supporting APP, he said, “People are fed up with traditional parties, we are a regional party and will focus more on local issues besides we will be available at the beck and call of people of constituency.”
 
 Meanwhile, the Congress, BJP and AAP are yet to announce their candidates. “If Navjot Singh Sidhu is fielded as an assembly candidate, he is likely to bring Kapil Sharma to contest the parliamentary election from his hometown,” said sources.
 
 Similarly, BJP wants to field a celebrity if Congress picked a celebrity. “Our leaders are in touch with several celebrities, it is just matter of time,” said a BJP leader who didn’t want to give his name.
 
 Amritsar district BJP vice-president Sanjay Sharma had appealed to the party high command to give ‘due honour’ to former state minister Baldev Raj Chawla. According to sources Luxmikanta Chawla and Rajindermohan Singh Chhina were also in the fray for the BJP ticket for the Amritsar Lok Sabha bypoll.
