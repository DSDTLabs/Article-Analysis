SURAT: Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena (RRKS) leaders decided to discontinue their dharna against movie ‘Padmaavat’ on Thursday terming their protest successful as the controversial Hindi film was not released in the city. 

 “We are against the movie because it has distorted history in the portrayal of Rajput queen. We feel our objective has been met because the movie is not being released in the city. We will continue to create awareness among the people why we are opposed to the movie,” south Gujarat sangh rakshak of RRKS   said. Shekhawat, Sanjaysinh Gohil and Shailedrasinh Rajput had begun an indefinite hunger fast against the movie at an open plot near   here on Wednesday. 
 
 Tight police bandobast had been made in the city because of the protest against the movie. Two companies of rapid action force, one platoon of state reserve police and 270 policewomen were complementing the city police personnel in bandobast duties. DCB, PCB and SOG teams are keeping a close watch on anti-social elements. 
 
 No theatre or multiplex in the city screened the movie on Thursday. Many had put boards informing cinemagoers that   was not being shown in their cinemas. “No theatres have asked for bandobast. So far we have not been informed if any cinema will show the movie. However, we will continue to maintain bandobast outside the theatres,” city police commissioner   said. Sharma met leaders of Rajput community on Wednesday and asked them to cooperate with police to maintain peace in the city.
