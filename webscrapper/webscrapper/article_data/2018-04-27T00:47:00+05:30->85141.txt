Trichy: It’s certainly not the most sought-after among many sections of juice fans, but tender coconut certainly commands a large share of loyal customers. Unmindful of its rising price — it’s now selling at Rs 50 to Rs 60 a nut — they are unwilling to risk their health by consuming “artificially ripened and pesticide-administered fruit juices”.

 The sudden rise in its price by Rs 10 to Rs 20 has been pinching the pockets of such fans and health freaks. Yet, tender coconut has been selling briskly in the city thanks to the scorching heat. V Mani, who sells tender coconut opposite the corporation office, said that business has been very brisk since the beginning of April. He has been getting nearly 100 customers a day. In fact, many people buy tender coconuts for their entire family. With forecast of dry days ahead, he expressed the hope business will be good.
 
 On their part, coconut farmers say that trees raised under 127 acres in Trichy district had withered due to lack of water. Now, the coconut traders and vendors relied mostly on Cumbam for the tender ones. Due to high wages and transportation charges, vendors were forced to sell at higher price. Moreover, being summer, the increase in price was natural, said another coconut vendor, K Swaminathan of Musiri.
 
 “People prefer fresh juices and tender coconut to beat the heat. Vendors try to take advantage of this demand by charging according to their whims and fancies as there is no price regulation. Similar is the case with roadside vendors too,” M Selvakumar, a resident of Woraiyur said.
 
 “Though fresh juices are good for health, we should also consider the fact that pesticides are used for cultivating fresh fruits and chemicals for ripening them. So, it is always safe for the people, particularly children, to have tender coconut to quench their thirst”, he opined.
