INDORE/KOCHI:   Ujjain sahprachar pramukh   announced a bounty of Rs 1crore on the head of   CM   for the “killing of over 300 Sangh workers“ in the state.

 RSS strongly condemned and dissociated itself from the controversial statement and called it a provocation to violence.   secretary Siddharth Nath Singh too condemned Chandrawat's statement.
 
 Following the outcry, Chandrawat withdrew his remark expressing “regret“.
 
 “If somebody beheads Vija yan and brings his head to me, I will put my house and my property worth Rs 1 cr in his name,“ he had said on Wednesday.
 
 However,   home minister Bhupendra Singh said, “Everyone has freedom of speech. Chandrawat reacted against what's happening in Kerala.“ Asked to respond, Vijayan laughed off the threat but CPM sought Chandrawat's arrest.
 
 “I was hurt and angered by the continuous killings of RSS swayamsevaks in Kerala and expressed my feelings. I take back my statements,“ Chandrawat said on Thursday . He also threatened the “Leftists“, saying, “Three lakh people will be slain to exact revenge for the killing of 300 RSS workers.“
 
 Congress called the death threat a commonplace occurrence under the Modi regime and dubbed it as “reflective of the intolerant mindset promoted by the PM“.
