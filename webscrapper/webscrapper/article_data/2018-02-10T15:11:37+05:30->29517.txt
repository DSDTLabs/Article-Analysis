RAJKOT: A father-son duo was arrested on Friday for the murder of Velji Rawalia (48) in Padampar village of   taluka in Kutch district on the night between February 6 and February 7. 

 Police said   (30) and his father   (55), both residents of Kanthkot village in Bhachau taluka of Kutch district, were arrested from   railway station. During his interrogation, Hitesh said he harboured grudge against Velji ever since Velji outcast him and his father from their community.
