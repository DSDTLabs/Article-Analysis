PUDUKOTTAI: Komban, a prize-winning   bull raised by health minister  , collapsed and died after hitting a wooden post at the jallikattu held at Thennalur in Pudukottai district on Sunday. The incident happened when the animal tried to jump out of the vaadivasal, the opening through which bulls are released, but ended up crashing into a post. 

 “Komban suffered internal haemorrhage after the bull hit his head on the post”, the minister who was witness to the incident, told TOI. The five-year-old bull had won several jallikattu prizes including the one at Alanganallur in Madurai recently. “No bull tamer has tamed Komban yet. I have lost a close family member, a child,” Vijayabaskar said. 
 
 The bull was let loose from the vaadivasal around 11.30 am after 200 bulls brought from Pudukkottai and surrounding districts. This incident sent shockwaves across bull tamers and those witnessing the sport at Thennalur. A veterinary doctor immediately attended to the fallen animal, but could not save it from the internal injuries. 
 
 Recalling the Alanganallur jallikattu, the minister said that a video of the bull pausing outside the vaadivasal and turning around to look at the players had gone viral. The carcass was taken to the minister’s native place, Illupur, and laid to rest at his coconut grove. The family members of the minister and a large number of villagers paid homage to the bull. 
 
 Meanwhile, more than 800 bulls were unleashed during the sport at which a total of 103 tamers sustained minor injuries. Earlier, district collector   and superintendent of police S Selvaraj inaugurated the event in the morning.
