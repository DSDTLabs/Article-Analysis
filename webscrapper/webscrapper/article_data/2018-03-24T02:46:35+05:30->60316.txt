AGRA: The practice of open defecation hasn’t ended in a majority of Agra villages. Officials said that most people in rural areas see toilets constructed under the   Mission SBM (SBM) as the last option and continue to relieve themselves in the open.

 According to panchayati raj department records, while 3.63 lakh individual household toilets were to be constructed by December 2017, only 1.88 lakh have been built so far. Under the Swachh mission, a district cannot be declared open defecation free ( ) without completing its target of toilet construction.
 
 Officials said that there has been a delay in achieving the target due to lack of funds. The remaining 1.75 lakh toilets are currently under construction and will be ready within one year. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission (rural), the state and the Centre provide Rs 12,000 for construction of individual household latrines (IIHL) in villages and remote areas of the district. According to sources, due to the lackadaisical approach of government officials, proper utilization of funds is not taking place which is causing the delay. 
 
 Last year in November, Agra chief development officer Ravindra Kumar had issued a letter to the district panchayati raj department directing the SBM monitoring committees to identify the people who got toilets constructed at their homes but do not use them. All these cases were to be complied and action to recover the financial assistance extended to them was to be initiated. However, no progress has been made so far in this regard.
 
  District panchayati raj officer Jagdish Ram Gautam said, “Construction of household toilets is in progress. So far, 1.88 lakh families have been benefited. We are making efforts to ensure that the district is declared ODF within this year. Special awareness campaigns will be initiated in rural areas from April 1. Gram pradhans and village elders will be roped in to promote the usage of household toilets.”
