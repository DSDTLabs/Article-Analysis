KOCHI:   (PGDM) is equivalent to   (PGDBM) as   (AICTE) has renamed PGDBM as PGDM, the high court has held.

 The ruling by a division bench was after considering an appeal by Canara Bank, challenging a single bench’s order in November last declaring PGDM equivalent to PGDBM.
 
 Canara Bank had cancelled the candidature of Haridev S of Cherthala in Alappuzha to the post of marketing officer stating that PGDM could not be considered as equivalent to PGDBM.
 
 Haridev had obtained the PGDM from Rajagiri Business School and the certification was approved by AICTE. He had applied for the post at Canara Bank following a recruitment notification issued by Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS).
 
 Haridev’s counsel argued that AICTE had issued a certificate in August last stating that PGDBM would henceforth be PGDM.
 
 He also contended that other banks that also took part in the common recruitment drive accepted PGDM degree for the post.
 
 The court said AICTE’s clarification that PGDBM was renamed PGDM in 2007-08 resolved the dispute. Since the respondent (Haridev) was awarded PGDM after 2008, it was “clear that PGDBM is nothing but PGDM from 2007 onwards.”
