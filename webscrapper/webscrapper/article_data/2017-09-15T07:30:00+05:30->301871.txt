Mohali: Chandigarh may be known for its abundance of trees, giving it a unique character in this age of global warming. But the moment you step out of the Union Territory, the green cover starts to deplete almost immediately. To expand the City Beautiful’s character to its periphery, TOI has joined hands with Hero Motors to plant 20,000 trees in two areas of Mohali.

 The Hero TOI Green Drive, which is part of a larger national campaign, will plant trees in Peer Muchhalla in Zirakpur and Dappar army station in Lalru on September 23. These areas were selected because Peer Muchhalla seems to have more concrete buildings today than green cover. Similarly the Dappar army station has adequate space for planting saplings. 
 
 The green initiative will also help the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) in its ongoing drive as it has planted some 5,000 tree saplings in IT City. A senior officer in horticulture department of GMADA said that Mohali has witnessed a lot of development recently with new commercial and residential establishments coming up. This has eaten into the tree cover in the region. The tree plantation drive will help in replenishing this much needed resource.
 
 Mohali administration has no details of the number of trees in the district. As per India State of Forest Report, Forest Survey of India (FSI), 2011, Punjab has seen an increase by 100 square kilometres of forest area between 2007 and 2009 due to enhanced plantation drives by the forest department. This has brought the total forest cover up to 1,764 square kilometres or 3.5% of the total geographical area of the state.
 
 Between 2009 and 2011, FSI assessment has shown that though the total medium dense forest cover has increased from 733 sq km to 736 sq km, the open forest cover has gone up by 97 sq km from 931 sq km to 1,028 sq km. The open forest area has 10-40% forest cover density.
 
 If Chandigarh shines out as an example for others to follow in the region, it is not just for the trees in the city but also for its denser forests. According to a tree census by the Chandigarh municipal corporation, the UT has 1,65,597 trees in the urban area. The total forest area in 2001 was just 39 sq km and the other tree cover was 2 sq km. However, due to the continuous efforts of the forests department along with the other departments of UT, the area under forests has now increased to 48.03 sq km and the tree cover to more than 9 sq km (till 2015). Thus, the total green cover (forest cover tree cover) of Chandigarh as per FSI report “SFR-2015” is 40.73% of its total geographical area.
