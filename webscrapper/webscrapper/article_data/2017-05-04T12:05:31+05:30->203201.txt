PUNE: The city traffic police has made a short   to sensitize citizens about the   of using mobile phones while  .

 The film has been made by assistant police inspector Mahesh Sartape who is posted at the traffic control room. He directed the film with the help of professionals in   area.
 
 The two-and-a-half minute film titled “Yamraj” depicts three different occasions wherein citizens are talking on mobile phones while riding a bike, crossing a road and driving a car. In response, Yamraj -- the lord of death -- is seen asking these citizens whether they wanted to die.
 
 As per traffic police records, as many as 4,088 cases of people talking on mobile phones have been reported between January and April 30 this year. It means, over 1,000 cases are reported per month across different areas. The department has collected about Rs 8.17 lakh as fine.
 
 “We have come across many occasions wherein the vehicle driver met with an accident as he or she was talking on phone while driving,” said an in-charge of one of the traffic divisions.
 
 Cases of vehicles dashing against road dividers, jumping signals, hitting vehicles from behind are often reported with drivers talking on mobile phones, said an inspector rank officer.
 
 The department has already started seizing driving licences of offenders and suspending them with the help of the RTO authorities.
 
 However, the traffic department officials said the department was yet to achieve the desired results in this aspect.
 
 When contacted deputy commissioner of police  , said, “Talking on mobile phones while driving has led to many road accidents in the city and hence it is imperative to sensitise people. As a result, we have made a special film which will be run in all theatres.
