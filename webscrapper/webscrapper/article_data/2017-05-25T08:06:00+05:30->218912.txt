BENGALURU:   has the highest number of   in the country .According to the   (MCI), the state has 8,750 seats followed by   (7,120) and   (6,660).

 Director of medical education Dr S Sacchidanand told TOI: “Karnataka has the highest number of MBBS seats in the country and 350 additional seats will be available from this academic year. We have asked the Medical Council of India to sanction six more medical colleges to the state.“
 
 There are 56 colleges, government and private, which provide medical education across the state. Overall, there are more than 12,000 medical seats in Kar nataka. Academicians say Karnataka is probably the most sought-after destination for students to pursue medicine. This has forced institutions to increase their intake every year. The colleges where seats have been increased from 100 to 150 are Shivamogga Institute of Medical Sciences, Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences, Bidar Institute of Medical Sciences, Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences, Raichur Institute of Medical Sciences, and Mandya Institute of Medical Sci ences. The number of seats in the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences, Hubballi has been raised to 200 seats from 150 seats.
 
 Renowned cardiologist Dr Devi Shetty said while it's heartening to see the number of undergraduate seats going up, it's important to increase the number of post-graduate seats too. “With just an MBBS degree, a doctor cannot conduct major procedures. So, it's important that there is a proportionate increase in postgraduate seats too. Else the purpose of producing so many MBBS graduates will go waste,'' he added.
 
 The seat increase has brought cheer to medicine aspirants. “It's good that the number of seats has increased in some prominent colleges in Karnataka. Now, we can hope for more students getting a chance for getting admission,“ said a medical aspirant.
 
 Last year, the number of medical seats was raised from 60 seats to 90 seats in St John's Medical College, Bengaluru.
