 The PM was often seen thumping the desk, the loudest when the FM spoke about Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Scheme, which was followed by his announcement of the health insurance scheme to cover 10 crore families.  's wife and son were present at the Speaker’s gallery during the presentation which was punctuated by slogans of “Jai Ho” by the ruling members and “shame” by opposition benches.
 
 No opposition leader came forward to greet Jaitley, barring suspended BJD leader  , who also shook hands with the PM.
