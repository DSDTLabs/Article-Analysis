BENGALURU: Protests against the draft zoning regulations — which propose commercial establishments in the city’s residential areas — have hit social media, with residents posting   on various forums. The draft regulations were released earlier this month by the  .

 The two-and-a-half-minute video has been put together by video artist  , a resident of 100 Feet Road, Indiranagar. It splices together testimonies from residents who speak of how once-peaceful localities are being ruined by a deluge of spas, restaurants, coffee shops and offices. “As a citizen, I know the problems that comes with existing commercialization in residential areas. Anything more will be much worse. The visual medium is a powerful tool to empower voices from across the city — what the ordinary citizen goes through. All residential localities will suffer more or less the same plight if the rules are enforced,” says Mehra, who filmed the views of residents from Koramangala, Malleshwaram and Jayanagar.
 
 If enforced, the draft regulations would allow commercial activity along roads less than 23 feet in width, against the earlier 40 feet. Additionally, 100% commercial activity is now allowed on all roads that are over 29 feet wide.
 
 “I paid for a plot in a residential colony, I deserve peace and quiet. There will be no residential areas left if rampant commercialization is allowed,” said Jyothi, a resident of Defence Colony, who is also part of the video. “The infrastructure cannot support more commercialization. Moreover, I don’t want to be surrounded by commercial establishments with floating populations as it’s a question of safety. We already have strangers smoking and urinating outside our gates at present.”
