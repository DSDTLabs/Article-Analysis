Mumbai: Tata Institute of Social Sciences ( ) is probably the first institute in the city to have introduced a   space on the campus. 

 The hostel space, which will accommodate around 20 students, will be available for students in the academic session starting this June. The move, claimed a notice issued by the institute’s hostel warden, is in keeping with the principle of inclusion and affirmation of gender diversity at the institute.
 
 “Self-identified transgender, non-binary, gender non-conforming persons can apply for the rooms in the gender-neutral hostel. Rooms will be allotted on the ground floor of hostel IV on a first-come, first-served basis. The rest of the hostel will continue to be a girls’ only hostel. All general rules of the other hostels will be applicable to the gender-neutral hostel too,” said the notice. Interested students were asked to apply for the rooms by Friday. Some of the rooms will be reserved for the fresh batch too.
 
 Allocation of a gender-neutral hostel space was a long-pending demand from  , an informal   on the campus, which advocates for LGBTQ rights. Last year, the students’ union had resolved to demand for gender-neutral space on the campus. Students believe that this is the first step towards gender inclusivity.
 
 The institute, in the past, has been active in implementing gender-sensitive measures on the campus and has taken cognizance of sexual harassment complaints too. It even allowed students to opt for gender-neutral salutation in their certificates. 
 
 The institute’s move to provide gender-neutral hostel space was lauded on social media. A student, however, said there should be increased awareness among students too to make the campus more gender sensitive.
