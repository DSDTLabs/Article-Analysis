VIJAYAWADA: While the Union government continues to levy 12% GST on sanitary napkins, the   government has given women a gift on the International Women’s Day by providing sanitary napkins to schoolgirls, and women from self-help groups (SHGs) for free. State finance minister   announced a budgetary allocation of Rs 127 crore under two separate heads for sanitary napkins.

 Ramakrishnudu said girl students in high schools and colleges tend to skip lectures during their menstrual cycle, leading to increasing rate of dropouts. This maily because of lack of awareness and inability to afford sanitary napkins. 
 
 The minister said the state would like to address the issue by supplying sanitary napkins to girl students in government schools for free. He allocated another Rs 100 crore for providing sanitary napkins to women of self-help groups. About 80 lakh women from self-help groups would benefit from the scheme.
 
 Women activists welcomed the move. General secretary of All India Democratic Women’s Organisation D Ramadevi said there has been a widespread call for the GST on sanitary napkins to be done away with and to supply them free of cost by the government, at least to the poorer sections of the society.   from Vasavya Mahila Mandali also welcomed the initiative.
