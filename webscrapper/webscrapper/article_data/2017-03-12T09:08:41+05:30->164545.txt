BHOPAL: The Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh has added to the BJP’s tumultuous show from where the party won 48 of the 52 seats. Campaign in Bundelkhand region, that borders Madhya Pradesh, was spearheaded by Narottam Mishra, a senior member of Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet.

 “I believe in success and congratulate Prime Minister   and   president Amit Shah for the landslide win. We have won 48 seats in Kanpur region of which 19 were from Bundelkhand'', claimed Mishra while taking to TOI over phone from Jammu.
 
 After the victory, Mishra immediately left for Vaisho Devi shrine in Jammu to thank the goddess. During his two-and-a-half-month long campaign in the region and booth management for the party candidates, Mishra coined some effective messages for the public and against the rival political parties.
 
 “During his campaign, Mishra hit out at the Samajwadi Party through its internal feud and termed it as ‘Puttar Pradesh’ and not Uttar Pradesh for MSY's love for his son Akhilesh,” said a senior BJP leader.
 
 In his words, Mishra said he targeted Azam Khan on his love for bhains (buffalo), hit out at Mayawati on her love for paisa (money through donations) and projected Prime Minister Modi for his love for Desh (country), which gained extreme popularity among voters. BJP also gained after the internal feud between chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav, he said. 
 
 “It was not polarisation of votes but, Modi wave across the state and, I was doing a small job assigned to me by the party. I must appreciate the poll strategy of BJP president Amit Shah which played a crucial role in weaning away support from all sections to the BJP,” said Mishra.
 
 Mishra was chosen by BJP chief Amit Shah for poll management in every booth across the Bundelkhand and Kanpur regions.
