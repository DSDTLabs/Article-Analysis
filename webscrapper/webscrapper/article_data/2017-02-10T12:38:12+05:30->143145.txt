PANAJI: Across Goa, the project of constructing 1,513   toilets for below poverty line (BPL) families is under way, at a total cost of over Rs 7 crore, under the Swachh Bharat Nital Goem programme. Till date, 3,638 such toilets have been provided to   families and more of such projects are in the process of being sanctioned.

 BPL families, whose annual income doesn’t exceed Rs 25,000 and who don’t have toilets, are allotted the sulabh toilets by the government, with the goal of eradicating the menace of open defecation. But, land for construction of the toilet has to be made available by the beneficiary, free from any hindrances, objections, sub-judice matters, etc.
 
 Goa is battling the problem of open defecation, despite so many toilets being constructed for free for local BPL families. The reasons for the problem are very different.
 
 Open defecation has become an issue at most urbanized areas in Goa, especially at places with ongoing construction work, due to uncontrolled and illegal leasing out of premises, without toilet facilities to migrant labourers and families. Sometimes, tenants are even discouraged from using toilets as landlords add a condition while renting the place out, that more charges will be applicable for a toilet facility.
 
 The 2011 Census says that 53,003 households defecate in the open in Goa, without access to even public toilets. In North Goa, 24.4% households have open drainage and 35.8% have no drainage at all. In South Goa, 26% have open drainage and 25.5% have to do without any drainage. 
 
 Residents of around 20% households in Goa don’t have any toilet facility available within the premises where they reside and make use of public toilets.
 
 Salcete is reported to have the highest concentration of houses without toilets within residential premises. Margao, Cuncolim, Verna, Raia and   house most of these households, according to the data.
