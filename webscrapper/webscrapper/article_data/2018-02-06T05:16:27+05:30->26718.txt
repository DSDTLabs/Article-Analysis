MEERUT: A 23-year-old Bulan dshahr woman who hanged herself over a month ago after she was allegedly raped by her prospective groom, an Armyman, died at Delhi's   (RML) Hospital on Saturday night. 

 The suitor, a Bulandshahr resident, had allegedly also sought Rs 20 lakh in dowry. Doctors at   had said there was little hope for the woman, in a coma from the suicide bid, would recover since the noose had cut off blood supply to the brain, causing irreversible damage. 
 
 On Monday, Bulandhahr district magistrate (DM)   directed police to add IPC Section 306 (abetment to suicide) in the case and file a chargesheet against the accused. 
 
 When contacted, the woman's father, a former  , said, "Our daughter has gone forever. But, at least, the culprit must be punished for his horrendous crime so that he does not spoil any other life." Earlier, her family had alleged local police had refused to file an FIR for more than a month saying their complaint had "little substance". The case was registered on January 26, but no arrest has been made so far.
