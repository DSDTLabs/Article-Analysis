NAGPUR: “Uday has battled with death in an exemplary manner. There was something vital yet to be achieved and assets yet to be manifested. Today, he is not just a gemstone but a milestone,” said Dr Vedprakash Mishra, chancellor of Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences, Karad. He was speaking at the launch of ‘Timiratun Udayakade’, an autobiography written by city’s famous paediatrician Dr  , on Sunday. 

 In 2009, Bodhankar met with an accident which fractured his hip joint. This generated a blood clot in his body and he suffered from embolism. He was on ventilator for three days. Experts felt that he won’t get back to normalcy and his state would be equivalent to ‘vegetable’. In ‘Timiratun Udayakade’, which means a journey from darkness to sunrise, he has described his miraculous recovery and the challenges he faced.
 
 In his poetic style, Dr Mishra exclaimed, “This is not Uday’s autobiography, but it is death’s. Someday, death will surely mention about its defeat against Uday. “Bodhankar’s existence is a blessing for his patients and society. He has enriched innumerable lives and people have made constant prayers for him,” Dr Mishra added. 
 
 Dr Bodhankar expressed his gratitude to cardiac anaesthetic Dr Deepak Tempe, neuro physician Dr   and cardiologist Dr   for helping him spring back to life. He also thanked his colleagues, friends, wife Sunita and children Nikhil and Priyanka for their unflinching love and support. 
 
 Speaking about the author, renowned writer Supriya Iyer said, “His name itself means sunrise. He has a strong willpower that helped him outshine.” Iyer appreciated the approach Dr Bodhankar takes to solve any issue. 
 
 Director of   Dr Anoop Marar and Dr Vikas Bisen were present. 
 
 The book was published by Sahitya Prasar Kendra.
