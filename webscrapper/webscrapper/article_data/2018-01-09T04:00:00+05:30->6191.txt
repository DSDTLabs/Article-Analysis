Vadodara: Bail plea of an elderly woman and a man, who were arrested last week in connection with a prostitution racket, were rejected by sessions court here on Monday.

 Sheela Almeida, accused of running the racket, and Manish Agrawal, who had allegedly gone at the former’s house as a customer, were arrested following a raid at Ambica Society in Sama on January 1. The duo had filed for bail in sessions court on January 3 after their police custody ended.
 
 During the hearing, police told the court that Almeida had been taking advantage of poor economic background of some girls and forcing them into prostitution. It was also argued that she was arrested earlier in 2006 for similar offence, yet she again started the illegal business. 
 
 Police also raised the doubts that if the duo will be granted bail they will not remain present during the trial of the case.
 
 The court upheld the police’s arguments and denied them bail.
 
 When the police had raided Almeida’s house, Agrawal was caught allegedly in a compromising position with a girl. Almeida was found from another room and it was learnt that she had been running the racket since a month as she needed money.
