MUMBAI: The world's heaviest woman,   from Egypt, was admitted to Mumbai's Saifee Hospital early on Saturday. She is in Mumbai to undergo weight-reduction bariatric surgery by Dr Muffazal Lakdwala, who petitioned union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj two months back for permission for Eman to travel to Mumbai for treatment.

 Confirming Eman's admission, a spokesperson for the doctor said that a thorough evaluation will be carried about before in the next two days.
 
  
  
 
 With her arrival in Mumbai, Eman, who weighs over 500 kg, thus completed her first trip outside her home in over 25 years.
 
 Dr Lakdawala had previously told TOI that his colleagues had began treating from December itself, tweaking her medicines to ensure that she could take the arduous air travel to Mumbai. In a press release on Friday, he said, "To prepare her for the flight, the team of doctors have been in Egypt for the last ten days to optimise the conditions for her travel; given the fact that she is so heavy and not moved for the last 25 years she is at a high risk for a pulmonary embolism and hence has been put on blood thinners to try and minimise the chances of such an eventuality during her transfer."
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Eman currently suffers from severe lymphedema and water retention. She has already suffered a stroke resulting in paralysis of her right arm and leg, she cannot speak coherently, has type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, has severe obstructive and restrictive lung disease, gout and is at a very high risk of pulmonary embolism, added the release.
