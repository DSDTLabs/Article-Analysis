New Delhi: To assess a scientific way for disposal of construction waste,   and North Delhi Municipal Corporation commissioner P K Gupta inspected the construction and demolition waste management plant at   on Saturday.

 The construction and demolition  , functional since 2009, earlier had a capacity to process 500 metric tonne of construction waste but the plant has now been upgraded to process over 2,000 metric tonne of malba.
 
 Emphasising on the use of technology in waste management,   Baijal said, “The project is an example of a paradigm shift from illegal dumping to scientific processing and recycling of C&D waste. It is a major initiative to deal with the problem of disposal of malba.”
 
 Baijal further added that contractors must ensure removal of malba after completion of work at the construction site. LG has earlier directed the north corporation to set up its second construction and waste plant at Ranikhera after DDA allotted a land to the civic body for the purpose.
 
 North corporation commissioner P K Gupta said that the civic body was in talks with the private company handling the Burari plant to set up another such plant at Ranikhera. “The LG has set a deadline for us to install the second plant. We had already started working on the tender and it will be floated in the coming week,” he added.
 
 “Till date, 30 lakh metric tonne of construction and demolition waste has been recycled and converted into useful products like sand, aggregates, recycled aggregates, precast tiles and slabs which have been utilised by public through open sale at the Burari plant,” said Gupta. After taking charge, LG Baijal had inspected all the landfill sites at — Okhla, Bhalswa and Ghazipur — before inspecting the construction and demolition waste plant.
