Living in Mumbai now for over a decade, singer and music composer   is still tuned in to  . “When I am in Mumbai, I mostly spend time working. Mumbai mein itna zyaada kaam rehta hai ki aur kisi cheez ke liye time hi nahin milta. But jab ghar aata hoon, toh sirf gharwaalon ka ho kar rehta hoon,” said Ankit, adding, “Then we all sit together and talk till late in the night. And iss baar toh topic of discussion mostly politics aur elections tha. Political discussions ho bhi kyun na, kyunki UP ki politics yahan ki chaat jaisi chatpati hai. Everyone enjoys getting engaged in political conversations these days. Sab apni-apni party ke gunn gaa rahe hain.”

 But the singer will not just be discussing politics with his family members. As a responsible citizen, Ankit will also be participating in programmes to motivate people in his hometown to vote in the elections. “I will be recording a video message to motivate people to vote, in the upcoming elections, on the request of Kaushal Raj Sharma ji, the Kanpur district magistrate. This video will be shown in multiplexes and cinema halls across the city. I am happy that I am getting this opportunity to do something for my city folks,” said Ankit, who will be going to Kanpur to cast his vote. “I am also performing there on February 26, but uske pehle mein vote daalne jaaunga,” he said.
