BHUBANESWAR: Grass unfit for fodder will be replaced by a more palatable meadow in the   (STR) in an effort to increase density of grassland for prey animals. Seeds of new grass will be sown over 150 hectare, which the authorities have identified as useless meadow.

 STR sources said out of total 460 hectare of grassland in the reserve, grass spreads over 150 hectare have to be uprooted to grow new grass. Prey animals such as deer, barking deer, sambar, wild boar and mouse deer depend on the meadow for food. 
 
 Official sources said a grass expert has been hired to provide technical guidance to STR authorities for planting and nurturing grass in a scientific manner. "We have already started drying the grass seeds, which will be sown on the vacant space after useless grass has been uprooted. The animals don't like to eat it. Just before monsoon, we will sow the seeds in the grassland so that they grow and become suitable for food from next winter," said grass expert Triptirekha Kar. 
 
 At present, the STR is also developing a new meadow patch at Chahala, which is known for better animal sighting. "The grass is being grown at Chahala so that we can uproot them and plant in vacant space to increase the area of meadow. We have put up fence around the meadow plantation site for protection," said STR deputy director  . 
 
 The STR has also taken help from grass expert  , a botany professor in Amaravati College in Maharashtra. Muratkar has provided guidance to   to grow meadow. 
 
 To facilitate wild animals hunt prey while eating meadow, the authorities have started alternate weeding of grass in every 20 metre. "If we weed the plant every 20 metre, the wild animals will have space to hide themselves to hunt the prey. Since the meadow growth helps the prey animals, we are keeping the required gap," Satapathy added.
