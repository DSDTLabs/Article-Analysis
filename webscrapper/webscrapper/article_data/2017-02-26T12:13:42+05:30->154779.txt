CHANDIGARH: The 2017 Hockey India League ( ) semifinals stayed true to it's script with the in-form teams   and   registering contrasting wins in their respective encounters here at the Sector-42 Sports Complex on Saturday. In the two clashes, that were miles apart in their competitive nature, the Lancers had to see off a nervous sudden-death shootout to beat the Wizards 4-4 (4-3), while an erratic Delhi Waveriders lost to Mumbai 0-2.

 The Waveriders had themselves to blame, missing a 27th-minute penalty stroke when Iain Lewers was denied by this year's FIH Goalkeeper of the Year David Harte, apart from also missing three penalty corners.
 
 Mumbai, who scored their winner off the stick of   in the 26th minute, could have won more convincingly, if not for the post that denied   and Affan Yousuf once each. In addition to this, it was uncharacteristic of the league leaders to miss six PCs. It was smart play by Mumbai, who stopped their first penalty corner close to the 25-yard line instead of top of the circle. Kemper man trapped it cleanly and moved in to strike it past Vincent Vanasch, turning the PC into a field goal that counts for two in HIL.
 
 In the first semifinal, a 58th-minute field goal by Akashdeep Singh brought the Wizards to level terms at 4-4, forcing the game into a shootout.
 
 But even that couldn't decide the winner.
 
 An erratic one-on-one between the striker and goalkeeper saw both teams missing thrice, ending the shootout at 2-2.
 
 The sudden death went as far as the third shot, when   beat PR Sreejesh, sparking off celebrations in the Lancer's camp.
 
 The Lancers leaped on their goalkeeper Andrew Charter, who made five saves in total, compared to four by Sreejesh.
