VADODARA: Bail application of kingpin of betting and dabba trading racket that was busted by the police on July 6 in Sayajigunj was rejected by the sessions court here on Monday.

 Accused Manoj Patel had filed his bail application saying that  , co-accused in the case, was granted bail by the court, so on parity grounds he too be released by the court. The police had requested the court to deny bail to Patel as he is the main accused and another accused   is absconding.
 
 Cops had told the court that the investigation in the case is on and since one accused is absconding, there are possibilities that Patel may hamper the investigations and influence the witnesses. The affidavit filed by the police also mentioned that the rent agreement of the place, which was raided, was also done by Patel in his name.
 
 The court of additional sessions judge H N Trivedi, while rejecting Patel’s bail plea, observed that the co-accused Tarun’s role in the case is different than his. Tarun, who is also Patel’s brother-in-law, had come to meet him at his office near Kalaghoda in Sayajigunj before leaving for a tour when a team of prevention of crime branch (PCB) had raided the place. 
 
 When the police had raided the place, Thakkar was placing bets with Patel on   cricket match through phone.
