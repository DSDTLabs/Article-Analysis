Pimpri Chinchwad: Twelve-year-old Adit Pole cannot play in the Dinosaur garden in Pimple Gurav. It is closed for the past two months. 

 Similarly, 10-year-old Shree Kanjikar of Kasarwadi cannot play in the Bhosari garden. “I want to play on the swings and slides. I am upset that the Dinosaur garden is closed and the Bhosari garden is not functioning properly,” Kanjikar said.
 
 Around 20 of the 162 gardens in Pimpri Chinchwad have faulty rides and equipment due to lack of spare parts.
 
 Even parents are upset with the damaged play equipment. Vishal Bhutkar, a parent, said, “My child could not play at the Nehrunagar garden. I am disappointed with the work. The PCMC should immediately repair the rides.”
 
 Corporators have repeatedly said the PCMC was getting a bad name because of the faulty gardens. The children also get hurt due to the dysfunctional play equipment.
 
 The additional commissioner, Pravin Ashtikar, proposed Rs10 lakh for repairing the the spare parts. 
 
 The PCMC’s garden superintendent, Suresh Salunke, said, “This is an annual Rs10 lakh contract to repair the city’s 162 gardens’ damaged play equipment. Whenever any equipment is out of order, the contractor repairs it,” he said, adding that they get damaged as at times adults use them and also because of wear and tear.
