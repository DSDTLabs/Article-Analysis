BATHINDA: A farmer from   village in Bathinda has been booked for allegedly misbehaving with Bathinda sub-divisional magistrate Sakshi Sawhney. The SDM wrote to Bathinda’s Civil Lines police station on Friday afternoon, alleging that Gagandeep Singh “unnecessarily quarrelled with her and obstructed her from discharging official duties at her office”. 

 As per information, a piece of land of Gagandeep was acquired for setting up a toll plaza at Lehra Bega village, on the   highway. He had gone to the SDM’s office to complain about the “inadequate” compensation given to him for acquiring the land. There, he had heated exchanges with the SDM. 
 
 Civil Lines police station SHO   said that a “case under Section 353(assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of duty) and 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) had been registered against Gagandeep on a complaint by the SDM, but no arrest had been made so far”.
