Surat: After BJP winning all the 12 assembly constituencies in the recent Gujarat assembly elections, Navsari MP C R Paatil is trying hard to change his image among the textile traders’ community.  In the last fortnight or so, supporters of Paatil from the textile markets have been organizing traders’ meeting in the important textile markets located on Ring Road. As the central government will be implementing e-way bill starting from February 1, the traders are demanding simplification and extending the e-way bill provision for another six months.  During the Goods and Service Tax (GST) agitation in July-2017, Paatil failed to connect with the larger section of textile traders’ community and had become a hate figure. In the 22-day-long agitation, traders had shouted slogans against Paatil for trying to create a rift between traders’ community with his divisive politics.  Now that BJP has swept the 12 assembly seats in Surat, Paatil’s trusted traders have once again become active by organizing meetings at each of the textile markets from the last fortnight to project him as the only representative from Surat who can voice their demands in Parliament and to the concerned ministries. Talking to TOI, Paatil said, “Traders are inviting me at their markets to listen to the problems arising out of GST and the e-way bill. I am hearing their problems and the same will be put forth before the concerned ministers in New Delhi. The problems from e-way bill is genuine and needs urgent attention”
