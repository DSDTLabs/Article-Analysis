HYDERABAD: Trouble brews over 108 emergency services as government doctors at Gandhi hospital continued their agitation against the proposal to enhance the retirement age from 58 years to 65 years. Nearly 17,500   of 108 services across   are wearing black badges to work from last two days and have threatened to go on   if their demands are not met. They are also protesting over the issue of job security, work timings and salary enhancement. These employees have threatened to boycott services from March 15. 

 The employees demand that the working timings be reduced from 12 hours to 8 hours and the workers be recognized as contract or outsourcing employees by the state government. "Currently we are working as private employees and have to do 12 hour shift for a salary of 11,500- 12,500. Even employees who have put in 13 years of service draw the same salary without an increment for years. The government must recognize us as contract or outsourcing employees, so that we have some sort of job security," said an employee, Anand. They are demanding that the basic pay be enhanced to 21,150. 
 
 The 108 emergency services staff, including call centre operators and employees who man the ambulances, had gone on a strike in 2015 over same issues. "We have approached all levels of officials and have even represented these issues to the CM previously, but our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. We are wearing black badges right now but will give a strike notice on March 2. If the government fails to respond, we will go on strike from March 15. The government must recognize us as contract employees," said Ashok Palle, State president of 108 Employees Association.
 
 So far there is no impact on the 108 ambulance services, but if the employees boycott services, authorities might have to seek help from other states, said sources.
