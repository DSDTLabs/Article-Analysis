NEW DELHI: Congress president   has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make use of the  's majority in   to ensure the passage of women's reservation bill “languishing“ in the Lower House for over seven years.

 In a letter to the PM on Wednesday , Sonia said   passed the women's quota bill on March 9, 2010, but the bill has been stuck in the Lower House “for one reason or the other“. While making the demand, Sonia also promised Congress' support to the legislation. “I am writing to request you to take advantage of your majority in the Lok Sabha to now get the women's reservation bill passed in the Lower House as well,“ the Congress supremo said in the letter.
 
 Releasing the letter at a press conference, Mahila Congress chief and Lok Sab ha MP   questioned “government's delay“ in piloting the bill, urging the ruling BJP to go beyond “symbolism“ in its commitment to the legislation. She said Congress leaders would soon meet the President and present him “lakhs of signatures“ collected during a party drive.
 
 
 
 
 Responding to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's letter seeking the passage of the women's reservation bill, a senior BJP leader claimed that the relevant bill, which provides for one-third of seats in Lok Sabha and state assemblies for women, could soon be introduced. The leader said the government may table the bill in the winter session but added that a final call has not been taken. He refused to elaborate whether the provision for 33% quota will be retained or amended.The bill was first introduced by the Deve Gowda government in 1996.
