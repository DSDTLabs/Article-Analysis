Navi Mumbai: After the chief minister announced the waiver of all charges during transfer of property, mortgage and change of use, citizen groups have attributed the change in the lease policy of   to the efforts of   MLA  . They claim that it was   who had put forth a proposal to the CM for more autonomy to lease holders in case freehold is impossible and had asked for relaxation in one time renewal premium.

 The issue of leasehold-freehold was pending for several decades. Residents have been demanding for freehold of the properties from leasehold to enjoy the real ownership of their homes. The CM has asked the UDD to soon consider reducing the premium slab mentioned in Cidco’s proposal. The government has agreed to Cidco’s proposal of perpetual lease for 99 years after the payment of one time premium.
 
 “Mhatre had held several meetings in housing societies and understood the problems of citizens. Now, we can execute the change of use while doing away with no Cidco permission and save a lot of money on transfer,” said   Bade, a member of an owner’s association.
