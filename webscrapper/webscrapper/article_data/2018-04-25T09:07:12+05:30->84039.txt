LUDHIANA: Hero Cycles Limited on Tuesday announced that in two months it will launch cheapest   of the country, priced around Rs 2,800 or lower. Chairman-cum-managing director of Hero Cycles Pankaj Munjal disclosed this during an interaction with mediapersons at his factory on GT Road here.

 Ducking the question about the exact price, Munjal said it would be at least Rs 500 less than the cheapest bicycles available in the country, which were in the range of Rs 3,300 and Rs 3,500. Munjal was accompanied by former managing director of Maruti Udyog, Jagdish Khattar, whom he calls his mentor in the mission of producing a cycle for the poor who are deprived of a transportation means.
 
 Munjal said, “There are 325 million people in the country who daily walk 6 kms to their workplace as they cannot afford transportation. Till now we were focusing on European markets, considering their size. But from now, we are going to work only on one mission and that is producing a cycle for Bharat. Hero resolves to bring this cycle for our people who earn Rs 500 per month. I feel we should have taken this direction long back. But it’s never too late.”
 
 Munjal said, “This cycle for Bharat will help save time of the poor and also improve their work efficiency. And at the same time, it will open a new market for the cycle industry, which is at present making only 14-15 million units per year.”
 
 When asked what role can the government play in increasing the affordability of the cycle for the common man, he said, “The government can waive GST on cheap cycles and also convince banks to give loan to people to buy them.”
