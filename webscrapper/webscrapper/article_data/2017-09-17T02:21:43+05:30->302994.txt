KOZHIKODE: Two brutal murder cases have left the police clueless about the victims and the culprits. Two such cases, including the one reported on Thursday, were reported in Kozhikode district in the past three months. 
 
 A partially burned body of an unidentified man was found near   in the city Thursday morning. The body was found burned using kerosene, probably after committing the crime to disfigure the face and body parts.
  
 The identity of the victim will help the police to easily identify the motive behind the murder, said a senior police official. The culprit might have disfigured the victim to destroy evidences from the spot and to hinder the investigation, the official, who preferred anonymity said.
  
 It was in the last week of June that dismembered arms were found at   beach. Dismembered human body was later found among slaughter waste at   in   police district limit. Though the police team from the city and rural district jointly carried out probe to identify the victim, no progress was made.
 
 A human skull was also found at the beach in the third week of August. Though the samples of all the body parts were sent for DNA profiling, the police are yet to receive the DNA test result to confirm whether the body parts belonged to the same person or not.
  
 However, the police assume that the body parts belong to the same person based on forensic reports. “We suspect it an organized crime. The body parts were abandoned at different locations to divert the attention of police,” said an official. “We have been collecting details of missing person cases from all police stations in Kozhikode and nearby districts. However, no man missing case matched with the case, the official said.
 
 Meantime, when contacted, officials with Chevayoor police station said that they would collect the details of man missing cases and statement of local residents to identify the victim and the culprit.
