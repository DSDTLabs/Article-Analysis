THANE: The crime branch police investigating the   ( ) case arrested a New Delhi-based private detective on Friday. 

 
 The accused, Pankaj Tiwari (30), who runs an agency in Delhi, was in touch with an arrested accused,  , from Mumbai. Tiwari has been brought to Thane for investigations and the police are hoping to get more leads from his arrest.
 
 "We checked Thakur's phone and found out that he was in touch with Tiwari over the past few years. Tiwari would send bank details and  ," said Nitin Thakre, senior inspector from crime branch unit-1.
 
 "Thakur was arrested last week after we surveyed over hundreds of phone numbers looking for any citation of CDR. We came across a chat wherein CDR and personal call details were procured over messages. We traced this phone number to Thakur's home located in Juhu Koliwada," he said.
 
 "The detectives usually cater to clients who want information about spouses or partners. They would gather CDRs and provide it to the clients," added Thakre. The scam came into light when the Thane police received a tip-off about Makesh Pandiyan, founder of   detective agency in Kalwa, illegally accessing CDRs. -Shrutika Sukhi
