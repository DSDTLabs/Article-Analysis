Panaji: Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) is likely to decide to severe its alliance with the BJP for the forthcoming polls. MGP has agreed in-principle to forge an alliance with ex RSS-Goa chief Subhash Velingkar, who has since floated the Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM). MGP has also announced an alliance with two others including the Shiv Sena. MGP will meet GSM leaders on Thursday to work out a seat-sharing arrangement and a decision on the alliance will be declared before January 8, MGP president Pandurang Dhavalikar alias Deepak told TOI on Wednesday. Insiders say the party wants to confirm alliance with Shiv Sena and GSM formed by Velingkar. A source said MGP will decide on Thursday on the alliance with BJP and in all probability will withdraw support to the government. MGP will not be on a pre-poll alliance with BJP. In 2012, the two parties had a pre-poll arrangement. Velingkar said GSM and MGP have agreed in-principle to form an alliance in the next couple of meetings. The first meeting is scheduled to happen on Thursday, in which the two parties will decide the number of seats each party would contest. Goa Praja Party chief and former MGP leader Pandurang Raut has shown interest to contest the Bicholim seat, while it has formed an alliance with GSM. Bicholim MLA Naresh Sawal, who resigned on Wednesday to join the MGP, has no intention of leaving his constituency. When asked about this tussle, Velingkar said the differences will be ironed out in the interest of the state. “Raut is mature and he will understand that the interest of the state is to defeat the corrupt BJP,” Velingkar said, adding all issues will be sorted out to form the alliance with MGP. Since the removal of the two Dhavalikar brothers —Ramkrishna and Pandurang—from the cabinet, neither party has formally declared that their five-year-old relationship is over.
