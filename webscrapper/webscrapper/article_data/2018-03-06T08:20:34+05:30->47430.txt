DHARAMSALA: A brilliant century by   (120, 110b, 10x4, 4x6) and his gallant 133-run stand (off just 117 balls) for the fifth wicket with   (70, 78b, 6x4) went in vain as Karnataka held their nerves to eke out a thrilling six-run win over India B in their Deodhar Trophy game at the HPCA Stadium here on Monday night.

 
 After being reduced to 23 for three by the Karnataka seamers while chasing 297, India B looked out of the contest before Tiwary and Lad staged a fight back. However, a three-wicket burst by legspinner   brought the Vijay Hazare champs back into the contest. In the end, India B needed 11 off the last over, but offspinner Krishnappa Gowtham gave away just four, while castling Lad, who tried to slog sweep off the third ball, to seal the issue. India B finished at 290 for nine.
 
 The finalists of this tournament will now only emerge after Tuesdayâ€™s final league clash between India A and Karnataka. At one point during their chase, India B looked heading for a heavy defeat after they had lost four wickets for 108 while chasing 297, before Tiwary found an able ally in Lad.
 
 Earlier, buoyed by a superb hundred by Ravikumar Samarth (117, 115b, 13x4, 1x6), Karnataka piled up 296 for eight. Their young seamers Prasidh Krishna and T Pradeep then delivered telling blows with the new ball.
 
 After having smashed the India A bowlers to all parts of the ground during a magnificent unbeaten 95 just 24 hours earlier, Hanuma Vihari was out for just four.
 
 
  Karnataka 296/8 (R Samarth 117;   3-49) beat India B 290/9 (Manoj Tiwary 120, Sidhesh Lad 70; S Gopal 3/29) by runs.
