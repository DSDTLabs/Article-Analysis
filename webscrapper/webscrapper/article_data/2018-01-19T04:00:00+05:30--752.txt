The Sarhad Dairy authorities have demanded hostels for camels across Kutch to aide procurement of milk. “Camels don’t stay at one place like buffaloes or cows. They keep moving during the day. It is very difficult for us to set up collection centres for camels at one place. Also, since camel milk has low shelf life it is necessary that it reaches cooling centres within few hours of procurement. That is why we have demanded camel hostels like in foreign countries,” said Vishrambhai Rabadia, director of Sarhad Dairy.
