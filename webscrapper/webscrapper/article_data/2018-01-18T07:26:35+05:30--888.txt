CHENNAI: The office files and pads being supplied to many government offices in the state are made of pulp from an unusual source – junked currency notes. 

 Following the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in November 2016, the RBI has despatched shredded notes valued at more than Rs 100 crore to the city’s   where they are being recycled into customised stationery.
 
 A prison officer said, “We are engaging at least 30 inmates in the stationery making industry. We have received orders from many state government departments and the industry is running round the clock.”
 
 Used in government offices, a file pad is a type of semi-corrugated, hard pad with corners embellished with coloured cloth. At least 1,000 office pads are made every day at the stationery making unit in   using demonetised notes.
 
 Each inmate makes around 50 pads daily and is paid a salary of Rs 18 or Rs 25 per hour depending on whether he is a skilled or semi-skilled worker. 
 
 “Puzhal prison inmates have so far prepared stationery items using at least nine tons of shredded demonetised currency notes,” said the deputy inspector-general of prisons (in charge) A Murugesan.
 
 Narrating the process, a prison officer said, “The shredded currency notes are pulverised and mixed with glue powder and powdered coconut fibres. The mixture is converted into sheets which are kept in the sun for drying. The sheets are then cut with a machine into the right size to hold A-4 paper. A sheet of wrapper is pasted on the pad. Subsequently, cloth in different colours is pasted in the corners.”
 
 Though six other jails in   including those in Vellore, Salem and Madurai make file pads, Puzhal is the only centre to make such stationery using demonetised currency.
