NEW DELHI: As AAP nears its second anniversary in power on February 14,   on Wednesday hit out at chief minister   for not fulfilling his promise of setting up aam aadmi canteens.

 While presenting the budget in 2016, deputy CM   had said, “We propose to start the canteens for providing nutritious and hygienic food at low prices to citizens, particularly the poor and downtrodden who find it difficult to have a proper meal…I propose a sum of Rs 10 crore for this financial year.”
 
 BJP said the ruling party was quick to close the Janahar outlets, started by the   government, but has failed to start the canteens despite allocating Rs 60 crore for it in the last two budgets.
 
 “The Janahar outlets were providing food to the needy at Rs 15 per plate. It is unfortunate that the present government decided to close this project without making arrangements to start the canteens,” said leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Vijender Gupta. 
 
 Gupta said while the government will be presenting its third budget soon, it has failed to deliver on the earlier commitments.
