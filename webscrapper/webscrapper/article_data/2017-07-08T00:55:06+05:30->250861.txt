MUMBAI: While the deadline for making corrections in the online applications for   (FYJC)   ended on Thursday evening, the   on Friday continued to receive change requests from students —most of them were having trouble completing their admissions under the  .

 “I did not opt for the minority quota while filling my application form online. Later, I realized that I might not get a college of my choice under the open category. So I approached a college to seek admission under the quota but they are refusing me a seat as I had not selected the quota in the online form,” said a student. On Friday, she approached the education department’s office seeking a solution.
 
 Officials from the department, however, said minority colleges have the authority to admit students under their quota even now. “We have asked the colleges to admit students who are eligible for the minority seats even if they haven’t opted for it in th-eir online forms. The college can then upload those details on the portal and inform the department about the admission so that the system doesn’t allot another seat to the student,” said an official. While the minority admissions, too, were to be held through the centralized process this year, the authority was then given to colleges.
 
 Several students who have applied under minority quota haven’t filled up Part-II of the form, so they are not being identified by the system. “Colleges can assure these students seats under the quota and ask them to fill up Part-II of the form when the portal allows changes on July 15,” said the official.
 
 Students also flooded the education department office to request other changes in admission forms. “I opted only for Thakur College in the online form but I want admission at NM College for commerce,” said a student who has scored 99.6% in SSC. The student, however, now has no chance to change the college as she likely to be allotted Thakur College in the first merit list to be announced on July 10.
