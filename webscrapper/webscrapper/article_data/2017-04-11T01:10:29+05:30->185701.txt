Mumbai: IIT-Bombay finally implemented its long-pending cycle pooling project for commute within the institute’s sprawling Powai campus. Currently, five bicycles are employed for the pilot run from hostel number 3; it plans to soon increase the number to 25.

 The proposal to encourage bicycles as a mode of transport to make the campus more sustainable and energy efficient was initiated a few years ago. Several general secretaries holding offices in the students’ council floated the plan, but the idea finally took off now. Through a crowdfunding campaign run, 100 cycles were donated to the campus in 2015-16, but due to the delay in the implementation, they were rusting. 
 
 The plan was again floated in 2016-17 and it was decided that hostels should take initiative for the project to succeed. 
 
 At present, the focus of students is only the hostel area, but it could be later extended to academic area. Students have also set up a cycle issuance system in place. But not many students on the campus are aware about the pilot project, said a final-year student. tnn
