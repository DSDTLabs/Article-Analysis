 CHENNAI: V   from the hamlet of   near   hauled in around 50 kg of fish every day during the recent season thanks to the   (CMFRI) which has developed artificial reefs as a fishing aid. 
 
 Sathankuppam and   in Pulicat were devastated by the tsunami in 2004 following which about 200 families from both villages were rehabilitated in another area nearby. 
 
 CMFRI officials subsequently started the project of artificial reefing to assist fishermen from these hamlets by sinking fish aggregating devices in different shapes along the seabed about seven km from the shore.
 
  
  
 
 Now, the institute plans to scale up the project, with 225 more devices being sunk off the coast near Pulicat a couple of days ago. 
 
 Algae grows on these artificial reefs which in turn attract several species of fish that feed on it and make the devices their home. Chandramohan said it would take at least six months for the algae to grow. 
 
 Perches, breams, groupers and barracuda are some of the commercial species of fish attracted to these reefs. At least a dozen species are caught by these fishermen and fetch a minimum of 500 per kg.
 
 The devices are sunk within a short distance from the shore enabling fishermen to return to the coast quickly in case of inclement weather, Chandramohan added. 
 
 The CMFRI launched the artificial reefing project with financial assistance from the International   for Agriculture Development in half a dozen coastal districts in the state over the past ten years, said an official.
