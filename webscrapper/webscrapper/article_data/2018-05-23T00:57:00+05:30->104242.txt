Trichy: In order to make budding as well as established entrepreneurs tech savvy to market their services and products spread across various sectors, a workshop to promote digital marketing skills was conducted here on Tuesday. Organised jointly by Trichy District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association (TIDITSSIA) and Entrepreneurs Development and Innovation Institute (EDII), Chennai, entrepreneurs from Trichy were told to make their presence visible in digital platforms including social media networks for marketing their expertise.

 With India having the second largest internet users only behind China, experts said that entrepreneurs functioning in tier-ii cities are yet to realise the potential of social network. “Digital marketing is the need of the hour which would take the entrepreneur and his or her firm beyond geographical boundaries. Instead of reaching out to the customers, entrepreneurs can attract potential customers to them through digital marketing,” Caroline Charumathy, digital marketing expert told the gathering.
 
 A majority of entrepreneurs who took part expressed that they are yet to make a dedicated space for their firms in digital platforms. Periodical awareness on digital marketing and workshops was touted as one of the strategies needed to expose entrepreneurs in tier-ii cities to advertise their services in digital platforms. “Almost every household today has a smartphone and every family has a user having an account in at least one of the social networking websites including Facebook. Such is the potential of digital marketing to make your presence felt among potential customers,” Charumathy added.
 
 More than 25 entrepreneurs from Trichy participated in the day-long sensitisation event at TIDITSSIA complex
