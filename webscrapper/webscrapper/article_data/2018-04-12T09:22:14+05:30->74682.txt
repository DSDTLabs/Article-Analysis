DHARAMSHALA: The kin of the three Himachal Pradesh sailors, who had been abducted by some pirates in   about a month ago, heaved a sigh of relief when they were informed that their release has been secured.
 
 Chief minister   on Wednesday afternoon tweeted: “We have secured the release of three Indian nationals Sushil Kumar,   and   all from Himachal Pradesh who were abducted in Nigeria. I appreciate the efforts of B N Reddy, Indian High Commissioner in Nigeria.”
 
 The local MLAs and MP Shanta Kumar called at the residences of all these youths to inform their families.
 
 Sushil, a resident of Nagrota Suriyan, was the captain of the ship. His father Raghuvir Singh said, “My son has been working in merchant navy for the last 13 years and was captain of a merchant ship. It was for the first time in so many years that such an incident has happened. We have spent restless days.”
 
 “I am grateful to all the leaders of the state who have helped lobby for the release of my nephew. We have been informed that he will reach India in the next 2 to 3 days,” said  , a relative of Ajay Kumar, a resident of Palampur who had also been kidnapped with Sushil and Pankaj Kumar of Samloti village.
 
 All three sailors were working with Max Marine Services in Cortnou Benin since November 26 last year. The pirates had made calls to the families of the kidnapped youth multiple times demanding a ransom of Rs 20 lakh per head.
 
 According to information, the families then contacted the ship owner, who informed them that he was trying to negotiate with the pirates and was ready to give the ransom money to get them released. They also approached the foreign ministry and the PMO for help.
