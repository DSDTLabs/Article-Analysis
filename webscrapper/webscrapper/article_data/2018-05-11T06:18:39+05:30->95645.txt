CHANDIGARH: City’s municipal corporation is going through its worst financial crisis since it came into existence, but that hasn’t stopped it from splurging money on avoidable works which are not of urgent need.

 
 In the past 10 days, the civic body has floated tenders for different works of over Rs 1 crore. The works include installing musical fountains, artistic entrance gate, open-air gyms, playing equipment for children in various parks and landscaping of different green belts.
 
 The corporation plans to install musical hybrid fountain with 49 effects in Sector 15 Floral   for Rs 5.46 lakh, while Rs 2.05 lakh have been earmarked for operation and maintenance of a fountain in Industrial Area. The corporation has floated a tender for installing fitness equipment at open-air gyms in various green belts and parks in sectors 27, 28 and 30 for Rs 34.11 lakh. There is also a plan for fixing   tiles in   and sectors 54 and 27 for Rs 12.33 lakh and Rs 43.72 lakh, respectively. For the development of the park in Sector 48, including installation of artistic entrance gate, a tender of Rs 21.14 lakh has been floated.   also intends to spend over Rs 13 lakh for playing equipment of children in various parks in sectors 8 and 47.
 
 Due to shortage of funds, works such as recarpeting of around 350 kms of road and building of community centres have been halted.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, MC commissioner   and mayor   could not be contacted.
 
 Talking to the TOI, former MP   said the corporation should spend judiciously as it was going through a tough time. “Development works are good for the city, but the cash-starved MC must prioritise. Besides, the administration should ensure that required funds are provided to the civic body,” he added.
