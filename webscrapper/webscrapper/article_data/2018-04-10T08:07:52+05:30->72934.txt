AHMEDABAD: Thirty-five-year-old   had made all preparations for her six-year-old son, Jayesh, to join school. Jayesh, the only son among the family’s seven children, had just got a new school bag and uniform and was about to become the first of the seven to go to school. These dreams, however, were not to be.

  
  On Sunday, Jayesh and two of his sisters were sitting at the road-side stall run by their father,  , just beside Siddhi Vinayak Complex near the New Cotton Mill police chowky in Amraiwadi.
 
  “Wires from an illegal electric connection taken by a watermelon seller had come in contact with an metal shed. Jayesh accidentally touched a metal pillar of the shed while playing and was electrocuted. His mother eventually pulled him away, but he had fallen unconscious by then,” said Harshad Patel, a local social worker.
 
 Patel said Jayesh was rushed to Civil Hospital by an ambulance but died on the way there. “His mother is in a state of shock and can’t even talk. They are a poor family and earning their bread selling old clothes on a hand cart. We will try to help them,” said Patel.
 
 Amraiwadi police have booked the watermelon seller and the pan shop owner who provided the illegal electricity connection.
 
 “Officials of the electricity company then rushed to the spot and disconnected several illegal electric connections taken by roadside vendors.
