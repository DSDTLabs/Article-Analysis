BENGALURU: The   and JD(S) traded barbs over the gold scam in Shivamogga District Cooperative Central (DCC) Bank of August 2014.

 On Wednesday, as Congress MLA from Thirthahalli Kimmane Ratnakar raised the issue, JD(S) Soraba legislator Madhu Bangarappa and JD(S)   H D   objected to the debate, saying the matter was sub-judice. To this, Ratnakar took a dig at them and said: “Don’t try to shield the thieves. Perhaps, the DCC bank president has asked them to stall the debate.”
 
 JD(S) legislators jumped into the well and demanded that the debate be stopped. However, speaker K B Koliwad asked Ratnakar to continue the debate. Ratnakar said DCC bank president Manjunath Gowda was directly involved in the gold scam, in which gold loans were given from the Shivamogga branch of the DCC bank without gold collateral.
 
 Ratnakar demanded a   inquiry as the scam was over and above Rs 65 crore. Law minister T B   said the government was taking action and the scam amount was around Rs 63 crore. He said Gowda was found in possession of Rs 39 crore disproportionate assets during a recent Lokayukta raid.
