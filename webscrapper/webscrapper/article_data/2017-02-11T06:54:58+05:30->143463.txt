LUCKNOW:  , 38,   (west) has alleged that he was manhandled at Saadatganj police station where he had gone to seek permission to open an office for his election campaign. The incident allegedly occurred on Thursday.

 “They (policemen) first told me no permission is needed. But I was aware it's a rule that a candidate should seek permission. When I insisted, policemen manhandled and abused me. The flag that I was wearing around my neck and banner was torn. The guards there pushed me out.“
 
 Station officer   termed Azmi's allegation as baseless. “Azmi had barged into the police station and sought permission for a road show on Campbell road. When subinspector   told him that only the returning officer can grant such permission, Azmi misbehaved with him,“ said Yadav told TOI on Friday. “Azmi was not manhandled and we are ready for any inquiry,“ SO told TOI.
 
 Meanwhile, additional city magistrate (II) has granted Azmi permission to open the office on the condition that it would not be within 200 metres of the polling booth and that he would follow the model code of conduct. ADM (city) has also sought report from circle officer Bazaarkhala on Azmi's allegation. “I hope there would be some action,“ said Azmi, who collects orders from shops of electronic goods and supplies spare parts.
