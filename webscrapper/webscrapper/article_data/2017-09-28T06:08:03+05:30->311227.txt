One of the founding pioneers of the 'New Hollywood era' as well as one of the most popular directors and producers in the film history,   revealed that he doesn't watch his own movies except for 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' that also under strict guidelines.

  Spielberg's films have spanned many themes and genres in a career spanning more than four decades with classic hits like 'Jurassic Park,' 'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark,' 'Schindler's List,' 'Jaws,' etc.
 
 Spielberg reportedly admitted that he doesn't watch any of his old work because, simply put, "I don't dwell."
 
  The 70-year-old director revealed that the only film he has watched was 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,' saying that he had shown it to his grandchildren.
 
  "I'll show my grandkids E.T. for the first time. I'll sit next to them and tell them, 'He doesn't really die.' And, 'It's only scary for a little while and then you grow to love him,'" he stated and continued, "I guide them through the experience."
