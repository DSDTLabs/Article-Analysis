CHANDIGARH: When   clash against Mohali-based Minerva Punjab FC in an I-League match on Wednesday, a former   (CFA) trainee will lead the Meghalaya club at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium in Panchkula.  , who trained under legendary   coach   for five years (2009-14), will wear the captain’s armband.

 The attacking midfielder is all set to face his former academy mates Arshdeep Singh and Kamalpreet Singh – both now play for Minerva.
 
 “I have very fond memories of Chandigarh. I spent five years here. The city is like my second home and I miss it a lot. I miss my coaches, my batchmates and my seniors. If I get some free time, I’ll definitely visit the academy,” Lalmuanpuia said, a day before the match against Minerva.
 
 Barely 19, Lalmuanpuia is already leading an I-League club but the youngster thinks captaincy to be an honour rather than pressure. “I am happy that the team management selected me to lead the side. They have immense faith in me. It is an honour to lead Shillong Lajong,”he said.
 
 Apart from being a young captain, Lalmuanpuia’s free-kicks have also caught attention of football connoisseurs. “From the time I joined the Lajong Academy, I practised (taking free-kicks) a lot and continue to do so. I believe, with practice and hard work, I have become better at taking free-kicks,” said Lalmuanpuia. “I would like to be the country’s best footballer.”
