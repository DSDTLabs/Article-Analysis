 A Union health ministry survey on “Why rate of routine immunisation was low”, done before the launch of Mission Indradhanush in 2015, had revealed that 53% of parents in UP knew nothing about routine immunisation (RI) while another 16% avoided it fearing side effects. Besides, 14% had no idea about where to go for RI and 9% felt that RI was not needed. The remaining 8% included misconception and excuses.
 
 WHO monitoring unit, which keeps track of immunisation, has noted that Saadatganj recorded just 53% of RI coverage in January 2018. But it was better than November 2017 when it was 48%.
 
 District immunisation officer Dr MK Singh said, “In November 2017, about 30% children in city were missed which slipped to 21% in January 2018. The data shows that our efforts are working.”
