PUNE: In a quest to keep the art and technique of copper craft alive, traditional coppersmiths from   in Pune are willing to train anyone interested in learning the art form. From about 200 copper workshops that once thrived in Pune's city area, only 25 to 30 survive today. 

 The depleting numbers have prompted the coppersmiths to train anyone interested, rather than passing the skills to the younger members of their own families.
 
 Bhalchandra Kadu, a coppersmith from Tambat Ali, is set to launch a school to teach the craft. "I am the seventh generation member of my family to be engaged in manufacturing metal items. However, the next generation is not keen on carrying on because of the poor margins. I have gone to Yale and   in the US to teach this craft. The students there are interested in learning copper craft. But that is not the case in India," he said. He, however, added that copper is slowly regaining its old glory. "Copper is being used in architecture and interior decoration. The industry may bounce back, but there may not be enough coppersmiths to meet the demand," he warned.
 
 Harshali Potphode, the owner of Om Sai Articles, agrees. "This is a labour-intensive job with low margins. Though there is a spike in demand for copper items, the number of coppersmiths is depleting," she said. Speaking about the heritage of the market, Potphode said, "The copper market dates back to the era of  , when there were nearly 200 workshops. Back in the day, people mainly used copper utensils, so the business flourished. However, now people have moved to steel and glass utensils. People today buy only copper gift and decorative items."
 
 Kadu, who is writing a book on copper craft, added, "The advent of machines has done away with techniques like 'mathar kaam' or hand embossing. I am writing a book that will detail how each instrument is used to make copper articles. The book will serve as course material in the school that I plan to start," he said.
