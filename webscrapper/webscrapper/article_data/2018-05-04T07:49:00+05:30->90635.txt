Manali: Fighting the spring snowfall, which has been continuing since early April, Border Roads Organization (BRO) that planned to open the Manali-Leh highway for traffic movement by May 5 has now set a target of May 10 despite inclement weather conditions.

 After 13,050ft-high Rohtang Pass, the BRO has finally reached 16,050ft-high Baralacha Pass. The depth of snow here is 30-35ft and the area has been receiving fresh snow since Tuesday evening. Despite snowfall, the work is underway with help of snow cutters, dozers and excavators. The officials say they have to clear Baralacha-Sarchu stretch after which the traffic can move to Ladakh.
 
 Officer commanding, 70 Road Construction Company of General Reserve Engineer Force, Lieutenant Colonel Vijay Kumar, said the weather was inclement but they were proceeding further. “We have set a target of one week to clear snow till Sarchu and hopefully weather will favour us. We are working on Baralacha Pass. Here we are cutting 30-35ft of snow. The conditions are challenging, but thankfully both our men and machines are safe,” he added.
 
 According to Vijay Kumar, last year the Manali-Leh highway had opened on May 25 but this time they would open it two weeks in advance. Last year most of the stretches had no snow or depth was less due to melting by natural phenomenon. This year, the jawans have reached Baralacha early and they are faced with mountains of snow.
 
 “The area is witnessing snowfall almost every other day. It has affected the work to some extent. Once we get down of Baralacha towards Ladakh, we shall move forward till Sarchu without much effort. Once the snow is cleared and road surface condition is improved, traffic towards Leh would be restored,” he added.
 
 High peaks of Himachal are still experiencing fresh snowfall. Rohtang has recently received 5cm fresh snow. There is forecast of more snowfall on high hills in the next one week and that can further delay opening of Manali-Leh highway.
