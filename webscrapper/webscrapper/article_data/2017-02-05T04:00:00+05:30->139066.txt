Vadodara: A 32-year-old woman died early on Saturday morning after she was ran over by a train at Bhatkuva while trying to save her blind pet dog from coming under the train.

 Bhavana Makwana, wife of a newspaper vendor, had gone for a morning walk along with her three pet dogs. The incident came to light when her husband, Pravin, did not find her at home when he came after distributing the newspapers. 
 
 He told the police that when he returned home around 6.30 am, the pet dogs were waiting outside their home but his wife was not present. He then went around in the neighbourhood and later near the railway tracks which passes from near their home.
 
 Pravin found his wife’s body near the railway tracks. The police said that during the walk, the blind dog must have strayed towards the railway tracks. 
 
 To save the dog from getting under the train, Makwana would have rushed towards the railway tracks and died after a train ran over her.
 
 Pravin informed Manjalpur police about the incident after which Makwana’s body was sent to SSG Hospital for post-mortem. Pravin said that he will now have to single–handedly bring up his two sons Dipanshu (6) and Mitang (3).
 
 The police have registered a case of accidental death.
