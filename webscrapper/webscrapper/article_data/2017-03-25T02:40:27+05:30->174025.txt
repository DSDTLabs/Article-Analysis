NEW DELHI:   students protesting outside   on Friday blocked the busy Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg for a while, triggering a traffic jam that lasted for over 15 minutes. 

 The students were protesting against the May 2016 notification that led to massive seat cuts in MPhil and PhD courses in JNU. But when they came to UGC, they were welcomed by a banner that said the assembly of students was illegal and they must disperse. Around 100 of them tried to storm through the barricades, but failed. It’s then that the students decided to block the main road itself. 
 
 JNUSU president Mohit Pandey said they had come to protest peacefully. “I sent over 20 mails to   requesting a meeting, but received no response. Police tried to provoke us and also the people on the road against us,” Pandey said. 
 
 The jam annoyed many commuters, who requested the students to lift the blockade. “We decided to remove it as we did not want to make it inconvenient for the people,” said Pandey.
 
 Attacking the government’s stand on the UGC issue, Pandey said, “The minister says there has been a reduction of seats because of fewer teachers. Why aren’t they recruiting more teachers?”
 
 JNUSU general secretary Satarupa Chakraborty blamed the UPA and the NDA governments for not recruiting teachers on time. “We will not suffer the consequences of your mistake,” she said.
