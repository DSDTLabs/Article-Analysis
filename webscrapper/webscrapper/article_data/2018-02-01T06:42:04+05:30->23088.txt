KOLKATA: Finance minister Amit Mitra on Wednesday set aside a fair share to infrastructure — a major portion of it in the transport sector — in and around the city. As part of a comprehensive package, funds have been allocated to a number of flyovers, underpasses and expansion of high-speed corridors.

 The city will have three flyovers, including the one from Ganesh Avenue with two arms — one towards New Market and other towards MG Road crossing — and another one at  . But the longest flyover will be from   to   police station via   and   Road. Moreover, there will be vehicular underpasses at Chiria More, Sinthi More and Tobin Road.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Apart from strengthening the infrastructure, the budget has sanctioned funds to make commuting in the city easier. The state has already bought 411 buses for its five state transport undertakings (STUs). And now, it will procure 40 more electric buses. This will, to some extent, set right the skewed government-private bus ratio.
 
 An integrated traffic management and surveillance system is being rolled out for smoother and seamless movement of passengers from bus and tram termini to Metro stations, and also to vessels. This year, the transport department is going to integrate all major modes through common prepaid transport card modelled on the Oyster card of London.
 
 Riverine transportation along National Waterway-I is going to be the one of biggest highlight of this year’s budget with state’s ambitious Rs 1,021-crore riverine transportation augmentation proposal. The state government had forwarded the project proposal to the World Bank seeking a loan worth Rs 714.7 crore. The state will fund the balance Rs 306.3 crore.
 
 Ever since the stretch between   and Allahabad has been declared a national waterway by the Centre, the Bengal government has been playing an active role for greater and systematic movement of goods as well as passengers along the river.
