NEW DELHI:   will send a team of officials to Chennai to assess the damage done to coastline by an oil spill, caused by collision of two cargo ships near the city on Saturday.

 "As the matter was also raised here in the Rajya Sabha and a Parliamentary Standing Committee on environment took suo motu cognisance of the oil spill, the ministry sought for ground report and will accordingly inform the Parliament about the efforts being made to minimise the damage to the coastline", said an official.
 
 He said, "The ministry has been in regular touch with the state government as well as the shipping ministry ever since the oil spill reported on January 28". The government is likely to share details of the incident with the Parliament on Friday.
  
 Raising the issue in Rajya Sabha, the DMK MP Kanimozhi pointed out at lack of coordination during the clean-up process and even sought a probe into the collision of the ships.
 
 She said, "I would like to bring to the notice of the House that different organisations of the government are not coming together when damage like this happens. And, there are reports indicating that around 35 kilometres of the Chennai coastline have been polluted".
 
 She further added that there was lack of trained persons to deal with such a situation and various wings of the government were not coordinating properly to clear the oil spill which has resulting in destruction of marine life in the area, including turtles.
 
 Reports from the ground noted that the Coast Guard personnel and local fishermen have been engaged in clearing the oil spill in the sea. They reportedly resorted to manual cleaning after mechanised super suckers failed to pump out the thickening sludge. Besides Marina Beach, the oil spill spread some 35 km till Vettuvankeni in the south.
