TIRUPUR: The Avinashi-Athikadavu Project struggle committee has taken a call to withdraw indefinite hunger strike planned from February 8 as they believe that the government would implement the project without any further delay.

 As the state government failed to meet its own deadline for laying foundation stone for the project on December 31, the committee had decided to launch an indefinite hunger strike from February 8. On Tuesday, its members met chief minister   and other ministers.
 
 “The chief minister said the state government was taking all the efforts to complete the paper works to implement the project at the earliest. Earlier, the government had allocated Rs 250 crore for the project. Now, it will issue a new order as the project has been modified,” said M S Sambath Kumar, coordinator of the committee. The CM has also assured them of a positive announcement in the upcoming assembly session.
 
 The CM also said the government was careful about the project plan as they didn’t want people to suffer during its execution, said D Prabakaran, another coordinator of the committee.
 
 “The government always made us believe that the project would be implemented soon. Six years ago, when ground water was available at 50ft,   from western districts had raised the need for the project. Ground water level has now gone down to 1,800ft, but the project is yet to be realised,” said M  , son of former   K  , who first raised the need forAvinashi-Athikadavu ground water recharge scheme. 
 
 “We were betrayed by the previous governments. If the present government were to fail to implement the project, we will intensify protests. Farmers in Nilgiris, Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode will, however, hail the government forever if the project is executed,” Velusamy added.
