Ludhiana: Secretary (school education) Krishan Kumar on Saturday addressed elementary teacher training block primary education officers (BPEOs) through EDUSAT. 

 District education officer (secondary) Swaranjit Kaur said all schools heads were instructed to keep receive-only terminals (ROTs) in functional condition. “In case of any problems they were directed to approach nearby schools.”
 
 Addressing the teachers through ROT, the education secretary said the department had changed the parameters to measure performance. “So far, performance of the students was getting only 8% weightage in teachers’ ACRs but now 70% of the points in the ACR will be given on the basis of the performance of their students,” he said.
 
 He highlighted baseline upliftment of the students under ‘Punjab Padho Punjab Padhao’ scheme.
 
 District education officer (elementary) Jaspreet Kaur said,“The education secretary has also ordered the disciplinary action against elementary teachers of government schools that have less than 20% pass percentage in classes I-V examinations. A Block master trainer is visiting two schools on a daily basis and a cluster master trainer visits one school daily and reports to the district coordinators and deputy education officers.”
 
 Deputy district education officer Kuldeep Saini said, “The testing is going on from the last 40 days and we plan to cover all schools. Teachers will be given a time of 10 days to take the performance from 20% to 50- 60%.”
 
 Block head Neetu Marwaha said, “Besides taking disciplinary action against poorly performing teachers, it is also0 the responsibility of the students to perform well. While principals are responsible for the overall result of the schools, teachers whose students have performed poorly in individual subjects, i.e. with pass percentage of less than 20%, will have to bring their student to the base line.”
