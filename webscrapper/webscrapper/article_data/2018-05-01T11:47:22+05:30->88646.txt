HYDERABAD: The   on Monday gave an ultimatum to the   government that it has to either admit to its mistake of not providing rehabilitation to agricultural labourers in hundreds of villages where it acquired land or be prepared for a court-monitored scrutiny of all the acquisitions. It also warned that if the state does not come out with the facts, it may even stay all land acquisition notifications.

 
 The bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice K Vijaya Lakshmi said this to AP advocate general   while hearing a public interest petition filed by the   that charged the state with showing no concern for the landless, who are the worst affected in the indiscriminate spree of land acquisitions by the state. The advocate general has sought two days time to respond. The case was then posted to Wednesday.
