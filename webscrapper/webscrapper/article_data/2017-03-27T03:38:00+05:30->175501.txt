Panaji: Congress again seems to be dragging its feet in taking a decision. Days after announcing that the party would file a disqualification petition against former Valpoi MLA and Congress leader Vishwajit  , who had abstained from the crucial floor test for government formation in Goa, the party seems to be in a dichotomy.

 “The petition is ready. The party leadership is consulting on two points. First, should we go ahead with the petition process as Vishwajit has already resigned from the party? Second, as he has committed a crime, should we go ahead with the disciplinary action?” party spokesperson Girish Chodankar said, adding that the party would soon come out with a decision on Vishwajit’s fate. 
 
 Despite being the single largest party in the assembly polls after getting 17 seats, by the time the Congress leadership could decide their legislative leader, BJP, with 13 seats, had already staked claim with the governor to form the government, receiving support from Goa Forward, MGP and the three independent MLAs. 
 
 In the ensuing floor test for the Manohar Parrikar-led government, Vishwajit abstained and later resigned from the Congress stating that he was not pleased with the way things were handled after polls. 
 
 “I resigned because I was disillusioned by the party that doesn’t have a future,” Vishwajit had said.
