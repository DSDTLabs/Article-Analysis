MADURAI: Customs department officials on Monday detained two foreign nationals bound for France at the Madurai  , after they were found carrying a Vinayaka idol. The duo,   and   from France and  , were travelling via   by Sri Lankan Airlines. They were handed over to the CB-CID idol wing police for questioning,   confirmed.

 The beautifully sculpted idol in what appears to be bronze has shades of red and green. It is around one foot tall and weighs 4.8kg. Sleuths suspect that the idol could be an antique piece (more than 100 years old), going by its appearance, officials of Archaeological Survey of India, Chennai circle said.
 
 Investigation revealed that they had purchased the idol from a store in Kochi. “The couple produced a bill for Rs 32,340. But the idol certainly looked more expensive,” said a senior official, seeking anonymity.
 
 “Intelligence sources say the idol could be worth more than Rs 1.5 lakh. Not only is the purchase of antiques an offence, but selling it too. The merchant who sold the item will also be interrogated,” an idol wing source told TOI.
 
 The French couple cannot leave the country until they are proven innocent, the IG added. 
 
 
 
 A team led by a DSP is questioning the duo. ASI officials have been requested to ascertain the antiquity of the idol. They are expected to assess the piece and report on Tuesday.
 
 When asked about the composition of the idol, the IG said it would be hasty to comment on it by merely looking at it.
 
 Customs sources said the couple were to board the 3.40pm Sri Lankan Airlines flight on Monday and had carried the idol inside a bag. It was detected during baggage screening. The two repeatedly told customs officials that the idol was not an antique piece. When the shop owner, who sold the idol was called, he too corroborated their claim. However, customs officials were not satisfied and decided to alert the idol wing.
