Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) will not allow any handcarts at the Race Course Circle near the Vadodara division office of the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC). Around 80 roadside eateries operating on the stretch stopped functioning from Thursday evening itself.

 The eateries in the area were popular amongst connoisseurs of street food. Their number had been steadily increasing over the years. 
 
 This had led to traffic woes in the area. Besides handcarts that were stationed along the compound wall of the GSRTC premises, the joints also kept tables and chairs that occupied space on the road. With vehicles parked beyond this furniture, the spot had even become dangerous for motorists.
 
 VMC official said that the area was not a hawking zone and those operating from the site were told to stop doing so from Thursday evening. Boards prohibiting use of the area for street vending were also put up at the site by the VMC.
 
 Meanwhile, a prominent hotel in the city located on the R C Dutt Road razed its compound wall as it was in the road line. The VMC plans to broaden the R C Dutt Road and land of posh bungalows of government officials will also be acquired by the civic body.
