 BENGALURU: With temperatures on the rise, shorter and more frequent haircuts are in. Among men, under-cuts, where the sides are closely cropped, and army cuts, where the entire hair is closely cropped evenly, have become popular. Among women, more are now  , where the hair is cut almost to shoulder length. Hairstylists in Bengaluru agree on a common point ­­men have given up their preferred cuts to keep their hair really short. “Parents too want their children's hair really short,“ Lakshmi of   in Amruthahalli said. Preetam of   and Spa on CMH Road in Indiranagar said he's getting more customers now because of the heat. “Many are going for under-cuts and army cuts. Some go for the Mohawk style,“ he said.
 
 In the Mohawk style, most of the hair is either completely shaven or closely cropped, with only straight strips of hair running from the temple to the back of the neck.
 
 Skill Touch in Koramangala said many ask for the   style. It's an undercut and was popular even before the start of summer, though the season is likely to have reinforced its appeal.
 
 Temperatures in Bengaluru have been rising, with some areas recording up to 38 degrees Celsius this month. As in many other parts of the world, summers have been getting hotter and longer over the years. Long and lots of hair when the sun is scorching hot can be irritating. If the weather is also humid, it can get worse and weigh you down.
 
 Among women, Preetam said, bob-cuts are making a comeback. But he, as also Lavanya, who runs a unisex salon in Yeshwantpur, said layered cuts remain most popular. 
 
 Layered cuts are where the hair is cut into different layers, with the hair growing nearer the crown cut shorter than the layers beneath. It gives the illusion of length and volume.
 
 Lavanya said women also ask for creative cuts, something that would make them look different from others.
