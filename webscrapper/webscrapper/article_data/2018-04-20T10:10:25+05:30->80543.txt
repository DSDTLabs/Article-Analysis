THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State   leaders have sought an apology from   president   for “defaming BJP president Amit Shah in the   death case”. In separate statements issued on Thursday, the leaders said the Congress misused the right of the public to file PILs to earn a verdict against Shah and make political gains.

 “The Supreme Court verdict rejecting independent inquiry into Justice Loya’s death is a severe blow to the Congress party’s efforts to misuse court rooms for staging political dramas,” said party state president Kummanam Rajasekharan.
 
 
 BJP national executive committee member V   MP said the PIL was scripted by Congress and its president to shroud Loya’s death in mystery and to make political gains.
