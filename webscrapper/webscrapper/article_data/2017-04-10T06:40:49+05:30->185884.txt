Union transport minister   has approached chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, a former mayor of Nagpur, over the BJP-controlled Nagpur Municipal Corporation's ( ) failure to redress his grievances. 

 At a meeting on the smart city project, Gadkari told Fadnavis that the NMC has not taken note of the issues raised by him in the old part of the city, where he is staying. Gadkari said that he impressed upon NMC bureaucrats that there was an urgent need for widening roads in front of his house and that efforts should be made to relocate the weekly markets, but there had been complete inaction.
 
 Around Gadkari's house in Mahal, most of the roads are narrow and major motorways have been occupied by vegetable vendors. NMC has not been able to widen the roads as there is little scope. Vegetable vendors said, since they have been carrying out their business for several decades, they should be rehabilitated. While Prime Minister   has praised Gadkari for swift construction of roads across the country, the Union minister is having a tough time nearer home.
