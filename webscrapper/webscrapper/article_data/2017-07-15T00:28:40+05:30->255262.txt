Mumbai: To ensure vehicles are not lined up on roadsides causing congestion, the   wants to build a   lot under   in   for over 5,000 four-wheelers and 1,000 two-wheelers.

 The civic administration has made a proposal for underground parking in the revised draft development plan-2034. The proposal has been sent to the BMC general body. After a discussion in the general body meeting, it will be forwarded to the state government for a final call.
 
 Though the proposal says underground parking, the BMC is contemplating a two-level facility.
 
 According to the plan, the parking lot will accommodate all vehicles parked in A ward, which comprises business areas of Churchgate, Colaba and Cuffe Parade. There are 54 pay-and-park sites in the area that can accommodate 5,762 four-wheelers and 2,544 bikes.
 
 Municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta said, “In the draft DP, we have proposed a parking lot under the playground. We will ensure that the ground remains in its original shape after construction of the parking.”
 
 The draft development plan has proposed parking lots under the Cross Maidan and various other public grounds. However, the scrutiny committee that conducted public hearings on the draft plan, recommended that underground parking will ruin the character of the inconic maidan.
 
 Cross Maidan is spread across 77,735 square metres (19 acres). The state government had allotted the maidan to 23 different clubs-trust-institutions. For some portion of the maidan, the municipal corporation needs to take collector office’s approval before proposing the plan.
