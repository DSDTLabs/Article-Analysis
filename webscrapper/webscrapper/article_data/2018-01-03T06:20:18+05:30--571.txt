AHMEDABAD: Anandkumar Brahmbhatt, a Naranpura resident and lawyer by profession was in for a shock on January 2 when he received the copy of an FIR he had registered the previous day for an accident where his wife had sustained severe injuries, including jaw fracture. The FIR mentioned her as as the accused in the case.   said that he was going to make representation to the senior police officials about this.

 As per Naranpura police, Brahmbhatt mentioned in his complaint that his wife Kinjal who also is a lawyer was going to   from her residence. When she was passing from Usmanpura underpass at about 10.40am a car driver ahead of her suddenly applied brakes.   also applied brakes but the scooter she was driving hit the car and she fell down. Her jaw got dislocated and got fractures apart from other injuries. The car driver fled from the spot according to the complaint.
 
 “We asked police to lodge a complaint against the car driver for causing the accident. Instead, they have named my wife, who is in the hospital at the moment, as the accused in the case and have applied sections of IPC and MV Act. I don’t know what to expect,” said Brahmbhatt.
 
 JR  , inspector of Naranpura police station, said that from the nature of the accident it is apparent that the scooter rider was at fault as it was her vehicle that had hit the car and not vice versa. “They have right to represent case but it won’t change the facts,” he said.
