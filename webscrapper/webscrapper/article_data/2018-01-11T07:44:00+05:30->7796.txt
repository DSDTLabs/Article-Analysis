Dharamshala: The cabinet meeting held here on Wednesday decided to disengage the services of special public prosecutors and also to wind up Himachal Pradesh Beverages Corporation Limited ( ), which was formed by the previous Congress government to control the liquor trade in state.

 The meeting, steered by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, decided to hold an inquiry into the losses incurred by the state exchequer due to the previous government’s wrong excise policies, particularly the formation of HPBCL in July 2016. The cabinet decided to shut down this corporation and provide wholesale licenses to the people, as was done earlier.
 
 After HPBCL was set up under the new excise policy, the then wholesale suppliers were told to use up their stock and the corporation, headed by the excise and Ttaxation commissioner, would procure liquor and supply it to all retail vends.
 
 The government has also decided to do away with the services of three senior lawyers hired as special public prosecutors — Kapil Sibbal, Salman Khurshid and P Chidambaram — by the previous Congress regime in the state. The cabinet has sought a report on the amount spent on engaging the services these lawyers and also decided to withdraw all political motivated cases instituted by the previous government in the state.
