PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The water supply authorities in the civic body have requested the irrigation department to release adequate water for the city as there is enough water in the Pavana dam. 

 This comes in the wake of complaints about inadequate water supply from various parts of   during the past few days. “We usually lift 450 million litres/day (MLD) water from the   bund. But for the past few days, we were getting 15-20 MLD water less from the bund. This is because less water was released from the Pavana dam,” said  , joint city engineer and chief of PCMC water supply department. 
 
  
  
 “Areas located at the tail end of the water pipeline network and on the higher ground were getting less water as less water was supplied to the city,” he told TOI.
 
 “Even as the demand for water increases during summer, we are getting less water. At present, the Pavana dam’s stock is at over 50% water of its capacity. We have requested the irrigation department to resume normal water supply from the dam. This will help us ensure adequate supply for the residents,” Dudhekar said.
 
 Earlier, PCMC would monitor the water levels at the Ravet bund only in the morning. “Now, now we are monitoring the levels in the bund even in the afternoon and evening to ensure adequate water for supply,” the official said.
 
 “There is 53.21% water in the dam and there’s no need to panic and impose water cut,” Dudhekar said, allaying fears of alternate-day supply.
