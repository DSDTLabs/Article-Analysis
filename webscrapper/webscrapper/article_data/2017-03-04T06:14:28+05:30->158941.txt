HYDERABAD: In a massive raid, the   (CID) rescued 30 women, including 10 minor girls, who were forced into prostitution at   area of Medak district.

 Sowmya Mishra, CID incharge, said 35 policemen fanned out across the area and arrested 35 traffickers, including 21 women, along with two customers. The raids were conducted following a tip-off by Justice & Care, a local NGO.
 
 The prostitution racket used to operate across 35 houses in the Japthi Shivnoor locality, by different traffickers.From the prostitution dens, police seized Rs 4.85 lakh cash during the overnight raid, making it the highest recovery in recent times.
 
 The rescued minor girls were forced into the sex trade by initially luring them from distant villages with the promise of jobs. The youngest victim is a 13-year-old girl.
 
 Some of the victims suffer from poor health and HIV, but were still forced into the trade, police said. All the women are from various parts of Telangana.
 
 “Each victim was forced to take on 10 customers a day. The traffickers charged around Rs 500 per 10 minutes. The victims were not paid and led to believe their payment was sent to their respective family members,“ Mishra said.
 
 CID sleuths said the gangs operating the prostitution racket are backed by some lawyers, who approach the court at their behest, seeking relief for them.
 
 Some of the victims who were earlier rescued in Yadagirigutta were trafficked again to Medak and rescued once more in the latest raid. The rescued victims were shifted to a private rescue home after they were produced before   (CWC), Medak district.
