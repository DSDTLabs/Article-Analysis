Jaipur: All India Kisan Sabha, in a statement released to the press on Tuesday, condemned the arrest of CPI-M leader and All India Kisan Sabha vice president Amraram, Hetram Beniwal, Shyopat Meghwal and others. “The discredited BJP government is only expressing its fear of the kisan mobilization,” the statement said, adding that democratic and peaceful protest cannot be stifled by such measures. The protest would only gain in strength and continue until the “anti-farmer, anti-poor” BJP government in the state is defeated, the press release said.

 Farmers have been marching from across the state to converge at the state capital on February 22, to protest the government’s inability to honour the commitment made to farmers after their 11-day protest in Sikar last September. Chief minister Vasundhara Raje, in her budget speech earlier this month, had announced waiver of farm loans up to Rs50,000, but the move would benefit only a small number of farmers as only loans from cooperative banks availed before September last year would be waived.
