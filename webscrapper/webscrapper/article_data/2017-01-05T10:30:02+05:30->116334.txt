VADODARA: Workers at the state-run   (GSFC) Ltd called off the strike and resumed work as usual on Wednesday.

 The workers had staged a dharna on Tuesday and alleged that GSFC laid off as many as 1,165 workers without issuing necessary show cause notices to them. 
 
 GSFC, however, said on Wednesday that it had nothing to do with the strike. 
 
 ‘The issue leading to agitation by the contract labourers was a matter purely between the contractors and contractor labourers and   had nothing to do with it. Production in any of   was not affected on account of this issue,’ read the official release by GSFC. 
 
 ‘Further, after discussions between the contractors and contractor labourers, the matter has been amicably sorted out between them and today the contract labourers have since reported for work,’ the release said. 
 
 The strike was called after several contract labourers were laid off from various departments without any show cause notice or any explanation for taking the extreme step.
