NEW DELHI: On Friday evening, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari replaced six district presidents and appointed 70 party members as election in-charge of each assembly constituency.

In Mayur Vihar, the party has appointed Darshan Pal, an office-bearer, as the president.
 
 To ensure that the party runs strong campaign in all assembly constituencies, BJP has appointed 70 members, including sitting councillors and MLA candidates, as in-charge of each assembly constituency. Former BJP MLA Anil Sharma has been made in-charge of RK Puram.
