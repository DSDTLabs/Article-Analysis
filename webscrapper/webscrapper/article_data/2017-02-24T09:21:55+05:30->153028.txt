KOLKATA: Authorities of CK Birla Hospitals have taken to social media to condemn the   last Wednesday. The public awareness initiative includes a gallery of photographs of the attack, along with video clips of doctors asking people to refrain from violence and vandalism. 

 “In addition to educating people, we hope the campaign will help us understand what can be done to lessen the conflict among patients, doctors and the hospital administration. We chose social media to launch the campaign as it has a wide reach,” says Dr Anupam Golash. 
 
 The vascular surgeon is among the trio of doctors whose video clips feature in the campaign, the other two being Sanjay De Bakshi and Ajay Mandal. A patient at a hospital is also shown appealing to the audience not to resort to such arm-twisting tactics as this will only aggravate the problem. 
 
 “Violence in hospitals is on the rise. This is about a civil society where the rule of law prevails and it is time that we stand together to raise our voice. We condemn such mindless acts of violence in hospitals. Do you?” the campaign says. 
 
 Launched a couple of days ago, the drive has already garnered 1,564 followers. “Patients might have grievances, which could either be genuine or baseless allegations. But there is always a more ethical way of resolving it. This sort of vandalism does not help at all,” a doctor adds.
