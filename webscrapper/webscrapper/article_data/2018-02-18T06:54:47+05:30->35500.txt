MUMBAI: Ratings major   has placed several debt papers of beleaguered lender   'under watch with developing implications', a move that usually precedes a change in ratings. In case of PNB, which earlier this week reported a fraud totalling over Rs 11,000 crore, it could be a ratings downgrade.

 
 A notice to the stock exchanges by PNB detailed that it had outstanding debt papers aggregating a little over Rs 22,200 crore. All these papers have been put under ratings watch and hence could be affected by a downgrade. Of the aggregate amount, about Rs 19,000 crore worth of papers are rated at the higher category, 'AAA', while one paper through which the bank had borrowed Rs 3,000 crore is rated 'AA' (double A), PNB said in its notice.
 
 Any downgrade of a debt paper usually leads to a slide in its price. Since a large number of mutual funds and insurance firms hold debt instruments issued by PNB, those portfolios are likely to witness some fall, fund managers said.
