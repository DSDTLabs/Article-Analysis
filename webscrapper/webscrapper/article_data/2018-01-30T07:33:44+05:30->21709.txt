LUCKNOW: The air pollution report released by   for 280 cities in the country paints a grim picture for UP with Ghaziabad being the second most polluted city in the state. 

 The assessment based on 2016 data of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has 15 UP cities among the most polluted 30 in country. And the situation is only getting worse every year.
 
 As per the report ‘Assessment of air pollution in Indian cities’, released on Monday, Varanasi was the most polluted city in UP in 2016 followed by Ghaziabad. Both cities were on a par on dust pollution parameters (PM10). 
 
 Pollution level in state capital, Lucknow, also grew in 2016 compared to previous year. Though Allahabad and Ghaziabad showed slight decrease in pollution but it was too little to make   better. “This is the result when we could get figures for only 22 cities in UP. Had it been all 75 districts there would have been more UP cities in the bracket,” said senior campaigner, climate and energy,   India, Sunil Dahiya. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 The monthly concentration of PM10 in the air of 22 cities was way higher than the   (NAAQS) fixed by CPCB.
 
 In 2016, average annual concentration of PM10 in Ghaziabad and Varanasi was 236 micrograms per cubic metre, and was 235 in Hapur, 226 in Bareilly, 223 in Firozabad, 217 in Kanpur and 211 in Lucknow, much above the normal of 60.
 
 
  
  
 
 Ghaziabad and Varanasi had the highest concentration for PM10 which was more than twice the permissible standard with vehicular emissions, biomass burning, weather and pollution from industrial clusters being contributing factors. 
 
 The report shows a trend of pollution levels increasing every year, say experts. 
 
 “We have pollution data for UP till November 2017 and we are assessing it. The report will be released shortly. Besides, we will present the 2016 assessment report to UP government in February,” said Dahiya.
