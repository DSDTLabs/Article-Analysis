The last two days have been very tough for Nandini and me, and all of us at Lodestar and IPG Mediabrands as we come to grips with the tragedy that took away 23 people in the stampede including our very own   Fernandes. It is tough to reconcile innocent lives being lost but it is unbearable when someone you know well, departs. Teresa was our executive assistant for more than 10 years and we saw her transitioning in the journey from a young lady to a happy wife to a mother of two . Teresa was truly special. Always smiling, never complaining about our contrasting styles, yet very dependable and efficient. Teresa was so much a part of my life both professional and personal—be it her help in organizing my daughter’s wedding two years back or my son’s admission abroad. When the news came in yesterday not only my immediate family but the extended family was distraught as Teresa had touched all their lives too. I have received so many calls and messages from industry colleagues whose lives she intersected. I wish there was some way to reach out to her and show her the warm and emotional words people are saying for her.

 Many questions will remain unanswered—why did she have to take a train that day (she normally didn’t)—it was her last day at the Phoenix office as we were shifting to Sakinaka, and post-Monday, she would probably not have needed to go to Parel. Now, the priority is to not only comfort her husband and her family but to minimize the pain for the two young children, though we cannot replace their mother.
