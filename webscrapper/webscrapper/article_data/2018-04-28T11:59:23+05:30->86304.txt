CHANDIGARH:Summer is a punishing time for residents of Sector 48, who deal with   shortage and erratic supply every year. Residents race against time as they only get water between 6am and 7pm. The problem of water shortage is so severe that it is difficult for people to meet their drinking water needs. Ironically, the city is among the forerunners in the Smart City Project, which envisages a decent life for residents. Not that things are any different on the lower floors, but here people resort to reserve tanks. Residents use the electric motor multiple times a day to pump water from reserve tanks to overhead tanks.

 People have often raised the issue with the municipal corporation and mayor Davesh Moudgil also visited group housing activities to talk to residents about this. He promised dedicated pumping or direct pumping from the tubewell from 3am to 6am at Kendriya Vihar Society. However, no action has been taken so far. The problem is more pronounced in group housing societies, which do not have underground water reservoirs. Due to low water pressure, overhead tanks do not get filled. “At the time of construction, the MC declined our request for the construction of underground tanks. Officials assured us that supply would be sufficient to fill the overhead tanks. Construction of underground reservoir is not possible now,” said  ,  ,  , Kendriya Vihar.
 
 Apart from residential areas, the motor market area has also been affected by water shortage. Shop owners complained of irregular supply as a hindrance to routine mechanic jobs.
