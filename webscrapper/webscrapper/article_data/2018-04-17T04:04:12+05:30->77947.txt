NEW DELHI: Congress said on Monday that its party functionaries never used the phrase ‘saffron terror’, asserting that terror cannot be linked to any religion or community, in response to BJP’s charge that it had maligned the majority community. 

  spokesman P L Punia said, “Show me a video or a sound clip where   or any other Congress functionary is seen using the term “bhagva aatankwad ” (saffron terror). There is no such thing as saffron terror,” he said. 
 
 Leader of opposition in   and senior Congressman   questioned the functioning of the  . “It (acquittal) is happening in each case since the government was formed four years ago... people are losing faith in agencies,” he told TV channels. Punia said, “We believe terrorism cannot be associated with any religion or community” while reacting to the acquittals, including that of Aseemanand. 
 
 The party’s stand seems to stem from   allegations that the usage of ‘Hindu terror’ in past was essentially intended to woo minority support by raising the issue of Hindu extremism and BJP-RSS links. Rejecting the charge, Punia said, “It is mere rubbish. There is nothing called saffron terror. It is a criminal mentality which leads to criminal activity.” 
 
 Asked about the acquittals, Punia said they will assess the judgment first and then discuss it. “However, in preliminary reports it has been stated that evidence was not provided and confessional statement is missing among other documents. There seems some failure on the part of prosecutionIt would be proper to talk about it later after the judgment comes,” he said.
