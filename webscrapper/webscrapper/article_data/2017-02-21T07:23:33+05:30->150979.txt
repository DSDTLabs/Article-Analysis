BELAGAVI: In an effort to instil confidence among students to face examination without any fear and make them aware of current affairs, the teachers of a government   in Marikatti village in   have adapted an   methodology.

 Apart from the syllabus, teachers of this school are conducting exhibition of science models, project making, quiz competitions, general knowledge test, academic and personnel counselling on a regular basis. This apart, special lectures from resource persons are also being conducted in the school for the past five years. The school has 296 students studying in class 8 to 10. The school is also giving attractive prizes to those students who win these competitions to encourage others to take part in these programmes. “These practices have really helped students understand the subjects better,’’ said a teacher. 
 
 The school authorities have been organising parents’ meet regularly to make them aware of the progress being made by their wards. Recently, a meeting of mothers of class 10 students was organized at the school where mothers were told how an important role they can play in the academic excellence of their children.
 
 “Ever since we started conducting these programmes, the students have undergone a positive change. The fear of facing examination among students is almost nil now,” school headmaster M S Hegde.
 
 Mallikarjun Ghodgeri, an SSLC student, said; I was very weak in mathematics and I had this fear in my mind whenever I used to go to write exam. But after attending counselling and special lectures, I have improved in the subject and slowly I am getting confidence to face examination.”
