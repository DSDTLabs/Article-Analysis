AHMEDABAD:   high court on Wednesday asked the Centre to place within two days the preliminary scrutiny report on complaint made against a judicial member of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Ahmedabad (CAT).
The high court grilled the central government for not initiating the preliminary scrutiny over a complaint made by advocate Sunita Chaturvedi against the alleged judicial indiscipline of CAT judge M Nagarajan.
 
 The court rejected the communication placed in a sealed cover earlier before it by the deputy registrar of CAT's principal bench, in which he opined that the complaint made against the judge did not call for any inquiry. Upon objection by Chaturvedi's advocate K K Shah, the HC rejected the communication by stating that he is not a competent authority to take any decision in this regard. Moreover, the communication was not supported by any order passed by the competent authority on basis of a preliminary scrutiny.
 
 After the communication from the deputy registrar was supplied to the petitioner, her advocate submitted that there is a well laid down procedure in rules which led to formation of a committee of secretaries from three ministries after the prelimina ry scrutiny. And the authorities were silent on whether such scrutiny was done.
 
 When the complaint was read out before the HC on Wednesday stating that the judge even overruled the HC orders sometimes, the HC judges remarked that it was a fit case for judicial inquiry.
 
 Meanwhile, an   (AIR) employee, Ravindar Parmar, has also approached the HC demanding an inquiry against the CAT judge on basis of various complaints. He claimed that a division bench in CAT had granted a stay on his transfer, but judge   had vacated the stay order in connivance with the department.He made multiple complaints before the central government.
 
 The HC is to take up this matter for further hearing on Monday.
