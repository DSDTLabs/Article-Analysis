VISAKHAPATNAM: Two more   positive cases have been reported in the city including that of a pregnant woman whose condition is said to be serious. In the other case, a government doctor with a travel history to Hyderabad tested   positive, but is currently recovering. The pregnant woman was first made to abort the foetus and later shifted from King   (KGH) in a critical state to Government Hospital for Chest and Infectious Diseases, said professor of medicine and nodal officer for swine flu at KGH Dr Indira Devi. 

 Dr Sambasiva Rao, medical superintendent of  , said, “The 30-year-old patient was kept in KGH for about 10 days since women and children are usually treated at the swine flu ward at KGH. But after her condition worsened and the baby was aborted, she was referred to our hospital. She is now on ventilator with complications. We can’t say anything about her recovery now. However, apart from the pregnant woman, the condition of other sporadic cases is stable.”
