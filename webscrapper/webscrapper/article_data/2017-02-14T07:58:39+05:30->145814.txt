PUNE: The Nationalist   and the   have decided to hold joint public meetings to campaign for their candidates with city Congress leaders hinting that the party might join hands with the NCP post election.

 The Congress and the NCP have shared power in the   for the last 10 years. Ramesh Bagwe of the Congress said, “The NCP and the Congress have joined hands for the elections and will have ‘friendly contests’ in some wards.” 
 
 “We are confident that citizens will reject communal parties and continue to have faith in secular parties. We will soon announce a time-table of joint election meetings by leaders of both the parties,” Bagwe said, adding, the party was not divided on the issue of joining hands with the NCP and that the decision was taken only after getting a green signal from the party high command. 
 
 But supporters of former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan have strongly opposed any alliance or understanding with the NCP. Chavan has kept himself away from campaigning after city leaders decided to share seats with the NCP and have friendly contests in some places. A section of party workers met former MP Suresh Kalmadi asking him to join active politics and support Congress workers. “Kalmadi is a senior leader and has mass support in the city. It is obvious that party workers look up to him as a mentor,” Bagwe said.
 
 However, the anti-Kalmadi faction has drawn attention of state party leaders to the fact that Kalmadi has been suspended from the party following corruption charges and cases lodged against him in the court.
