AMBERNATH: An 19-year-old college student was robbed of his wallet and cellphone by an unidentified man wielding a firearm on Tuesday night in Ambernath. 

 The man fired at the student who sustained injuries to his right hand. The victim is receiving treatment in a hospital in Ambernath. The incident has sparked off alarm in the area.   said the victim, Aakash Ghodke, is a resident of Ulhasnagar. “Around 8pm, Ghodke was talking to a friend at a ground in Loknagari when the man accosted him,” said an official from the Shivaji Nagar police station. 
 
 “The man asked what they were doing there. He then ordered Ghodke to hand over his wallet and cellphone,” he added. Ghodke told the police that the man later threatened him with a firearm after which he handed over his wallet. The man again demanded that he give him his handset, but Ghodke resisted. The man then fired a bullet in the air. The round hit Ghodke in the hand after which he panicked and surrendered the phone.
