NEW DELHI: This is an exciting time to play cricket in Delhi. Spring is here and the conditions almost perfect for the game. And, as Delhi lock horns with in-form Andhra in the quarterfinals of the  , here at the Palam ground on Thursday, all eyes will be on veteran  .

 
 Nothing seems to have changed for Gambhir, known for his batting prowess at the highest level. He continues to play like in the past when he was a Team India stalwart. He keeps on fighting even when chips are down, and seems unaffected by the politics in the team and around it.

Their batting revolves around the big-hitting wicketkeeper-opener KS Bharat – who was with the Delhi Daredevils in IPL earlier but found no takes this season – and skipper G Hanuma Vihari.
