PANAJI: The state government has appealed to citizens not to panic in the wake of social media messages being spread about the   virus.

 
 Health minister   said the Goa government has not received an alert from the National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi, regarding the virus infection that has hit Kozhikode in Kerala.
 
 Rane said a meeting would be convened on Wednesday to discuss the issue and added that the state is already taking appropriate steps in the matter.
 
 The Nipah virus is not airborne and will not spread like H1N1, an official said. The health departmentâ€™s surveillance mechanism for emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is in place, which involves samples being sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune.
