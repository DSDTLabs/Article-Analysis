Ahmedabad: A 23-year-old youth has filed a complaint with Chandkheda police against his father-in-law for abducting his wife. According to his complaint, he had a love marriage with a girl from Dahod and the girl’s family was against the union.

 Jeevanprakash Devda, a resident of Pramukh Swami Society, IOC Road, stated that he had married Chhaya Bariya, a native of Piplod, Dahod, on April 16. After the wedding, the couple travelled to different locations for a fortnight and then came to the city with Devda’s parents. “Chhaya’s father Kanubhai came to his residence at 10am on Saturday and entered into an altercation with Devda’s mother. When Chhaya came out after hearing the commotion, she was held by her father and was forcibly taken away in a car. Devda has mentioned the car number, on the basis of which further probe is taking place,” said an official.
