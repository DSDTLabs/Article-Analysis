AHMEDABAD: Samir Vinu Patel, an accused in the 2002 Ode massacre case who fled to the UK and absconded from the trial for 14 years, has been acquitted by a special court in Anand.

 The SIT judge R M Sarin granted Patel the benefit of doubt, because the Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT) could not furnish substantial evidence to prove his involvement in the communal violence in Malav Bhagol area of Ode town on March 1, 2002, in which three persons were killed. 
 
 The prosecution relied on 148 witness testimonies and documentary evidence during Patel’s trial.
 
 While acquitting Patel, the court ordered him to obtain bail for Rs 15,000, till the appeal period ended. The court also disposed of the case, mentioning the special prosecutor’s statement, that two other absconding accused are likely to be nabbed and their trial against them could be conducted separately.
 
 Patel had jumped bail and fled in 2002. He was tracked down in London in 2016, brought to India by the SIT and put on trial. Five other persons accused in this case had jumped bail and gone to various foreign countries. Before Patel, three other absconders were brought back — Nikul Ravji Patel from the UK, Ankur Patel from Australia and Mohan alias Sachin Patel from Singapore. All three were tried and were acquitted.
 
 The SIT court tried 41 persons for the violence at Malav Bhagol. Ten persons were convicted for murder and rioting. Nine of them got life imprisonment, while 31 others were acquitted.
 
 In two other cases of violence in Ode, 23 persons were convicted by the SIT court for killing 23 persons in the Piriwali Bhagol area on March 1, 2002.
 
 The appeals of all convicts against their conviction and punishment are pending before the high court in both the cases.
