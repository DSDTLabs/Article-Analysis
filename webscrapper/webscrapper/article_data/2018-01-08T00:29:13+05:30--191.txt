Mohali: Incomplete drains and service roads have become a death trap amid the thick fog that engulfs Mohali roads at night. The locals complain that due to fog it becomes impossible to see ahead on the road as a result of which the vehicles get stuck. 

 The locals complained that the incomplete drains at regular intervals have been left open by the local authorities which now pose as a grave threat to the residents. In the past one week, more than four cars have got stuck in the drains, which is not visible, specially on days when there is dense fog.
 
 Anil Verma, a resident of Zirakpur said, “Since the stretch along the drains is also the road to enter the residential societies, one has to be very cautious while taking a turn, as a slight mistake can cost people their lives. The authorities must take note of the situation and get the death traps covered as soon as possible.”
 
 Another local resident Fahim Rizvi said, “It’s not one specific point, but the entire stretch, which has posed as a trouble for all. The work of laying cement slabs on these drains had come to a halt long back, but since then no one has cared to cover them to avert major incident.”
 
 The situation is tougher for the owners running their roadside restaurants (dhaba) and hundreds of visitors who come by these eating points throughout the day. The space left between these restaurants and the open drains is barely 5 to 6 feet. The lack of space creates trouble, as people struggle to park and move out of their vehicles.
 
 Suraj Lal, a business man from Ambala, who visited a restaurant situated on the stretch said, “The road is always busy with heavy traffic due to which the only space left for parking is near the shops. The open drains, are very risky, as vehicles easily get stuck in the drains.”
 
 The owners of the restaurants informed that there have been a couple of incidents where cars fell in the open drains. Luckily, none was severely injured.
