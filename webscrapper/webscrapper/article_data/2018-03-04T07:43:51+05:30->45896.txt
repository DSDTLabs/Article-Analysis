LUCKNOW: Upset with state government for not reimbursing the fees for children admitted under Right to Education ( ) Act in two years, around 2,000 private unaided schools in UP have decided to boycott such admissions in 2018-19 session. 

 In Lucknow, 300 schools, affiliated to both CISCE and  , have refused to admit students. Taking a collective call under the ambit of Independent Schools' Federation of India (ISFI), private schools have decided not to admit any child under RTE in coming session till their dues are cleared. They are also opposing the monthly reimbursement of Rs 450 per child. "The government has fixed Rs 450 arbitrarily, and has not followed the RTE Act formula,'' said  's state president Madhusudan Dikshit. 
 
 "There is dissatisfaction and unrest among private schools. In fact, few have not been able to pay salaries to their teachers, and have come to the brink of closure," Dikshit said.
 
 As per the Act, private unaided (non-minority) schools reserve 25% seats for free admissions to students selected by state governments. The state government is liable to reimburse the fee amount actually charged by the school, or per pupil expenditure in government school system, whichever is lower. 
 
 "State government spends an estimated Rs 5,000 per month per child in its schools," said  , principal, Greenfield Academy, Sitapur.
