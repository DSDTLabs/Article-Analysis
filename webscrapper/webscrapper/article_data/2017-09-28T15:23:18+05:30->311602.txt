Hugh Hefner, founder of the iconic   magazine, is no more. He was 91 and is reported to have died from natural causes at the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles.

 Model-turned-actress  , who is the only Indian actress to have featured in the Playboy magazine, told exclusively to the TimesOfIndia.com that she found Hefner to be a thorough gentleman. "To have met Mr.Hefner at his magnificent mansion as his guest was quite exhilarating. His off-screen persona was a far-cry from his onscreen image. He was shy and very soft-spoken. I found him to be a thorough gentleman, one who knows how to treat a lady with respect, warmth and benevolence."
 
 Talking about her experience of shooting for Playboy, the actress said, "My Playboy cover shoot experience was nothing short of a paid luxury vacation. I was pampered silly by Mr.Hefner's staff and crew which made my cover shoot experience highly memorable."
 
  
  
 "Barring the photographer, everybody in the team that did my cover shoot was a young woman with a mind of her own. They were well-trained to think independently together. None of them looked at me as an object or a thing but as a spiritual being in a beautiful, exotic body. It's that paradigm that made it very comfortable for me to unleash my sexuality."
 
 Sherlyn calls her nude photoshoot as one of the most liberating experiences of her life. She revealed, "The cover shoot which I had personally anticipated to be highly challenging turned out to be one of the most liberating experiences of my life. Something within me had changed tremendously post the cover shoot. It was a shift in my consciousness. I had become aware of my limiting definitions and beliefs relative to nudity, freedom and morality. I then realised that the beauty of life is that it is meaningless. It is the meaning that we assign to things, people, situations and circumstances that determine our experiences. I chose to give nudity a very beautiful meaning which is unadulterated art."
