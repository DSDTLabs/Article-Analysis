Thirty-four countries, 24,000 kms, two drivers and a tough SUV. A journey that kickstarts in Bengaluru and wraps up in London. And the mission? To document palaces en route to the destination. Meet Deepak and   — the two travellers who share a common love for history and are now out to document the last remaining palaces of the world. “Because they are the only visible elements that connect us to the past of which we rarely get a glimpse of except in textbooks. In a couple of decades from now, they too might be gone,” says Deepak, who along with his friend Chandramouli, started their intriguing journey on April 8. And in keeping with their theme, the duo flagged off their tour from the  . 

  “Chandramouli and I share a combined passion for driving and traveling and this fuelled the desire to travel beyond borders. Two years ago, we drove to Singapore and enjoyed every bit of that trip. It gave us the confidence to attempt more countries in the future. Being history buffs, last year we thought why not travel across the world and check out the palaces along the way and make a video blog about the same? We immediately got working and it took us eight months to prepare for the same,” says Deepak.
 
  “Getting our UK and Schengen visa was a bit of a hassle, but everything else went on smooth,” says Chandramouli.
 
  “Our first stop will be Bhutan, followed by Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and so on. It is exciting because we’ve read of the exotic empires of Europe and Asia and now we will be getting to see their majestic places of residence first hand,” adds Deepak. 
 
  Being foodies, the adventure duo is only carrying snacks as they want to sample local food along their way. 
 
  “The concept of a global village is true to the last word and we are glad more and more folks are realising it. Traveling is the best way to live your life,” sums up the duo, who will wrap their journey in front of   two months from now.
