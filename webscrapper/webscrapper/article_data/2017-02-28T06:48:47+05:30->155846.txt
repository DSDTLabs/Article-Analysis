SURAT: Police from the districts of south Gujarat on Monday issued lookout notices for those   who have been avoiding   registered against them since 2008. They had served summons to the accused in Daman, but the bootleggers just disappeared from their houses.

 Police in Surat, Navsari, Valsad, Tapi and Dang districts had launched a drive against over 160 bootleggers of Daman who have been booked in a total of 350 prohibition cases. Two special investigation and monitoring committees (SIMC) headed by Nirlipt Rai, superintendent of police,  , superintendent of police, Valsad were formed by Shamsher Singh, inspector general of police, Surat range to investigate these cases and arrest the accused. 
 
 Soon after formation of these teams, the bootleggers were served notices asking them to surrender and cooperate in the investigation. The police later approached the court requesting it to declare them as absconders under   section 70. The bootleggers were not found in their houses and so the notices were pasted on the doors by the police. 
 
 “We received information that some accused could escape abroad and hence we issued the lookout notices for them. These notices will be provided to the authorities at all the airports in the country,” Singh said.
 
 The lookout notices will make it difficult for the bootleggers to leave the country. Police will soon be initiating the process to attach their properties if they fail to surrender within a stipulated time.
