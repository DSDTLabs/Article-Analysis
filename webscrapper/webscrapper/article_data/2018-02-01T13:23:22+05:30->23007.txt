VADODARA: In a surprising move, Vadgam MLA and Dalit rights activist Jignesh Mevani took up the cause of the families ousted from Kalyannagar. Mevani has set a deadline of one week for the Vadodara Municipal Corporation ( ) to resolve the resettlement deadlock.

 The Kalyannagar settlement that had around 1,900 dwellings was razed by the civic body in 2014. Some of the families there were given houses at   and  , but this was objected by locales as most of the residents of Kalyannagar were from the minority community.
 
 In a settlement with the victims of the razing drive, the VMC had promised that those not allowed to settle in housing schemes at Sayajipura and Kalali by local residents would be given houses at Kalyannagar itself and Rs 3,000 would be paid as rent to them till the scheme came up. But later the civic body had to take the decision of giving the beneficiaries houses elsewhere as the funds for the Kalyannagar project were exhausted. Unauthorised extra work on the project led to the situation. The contractor stopped work as his payments were stopped by the VMC. The civic body is insisting that the beneficiaries accept houses at a scheme in Tandalja.
 
 Mevani and   Imran   told VMC commissioner Vinod Rao that the right to shelter was a fundamental right and should be upheld. He said that the deadlock should end at the earliest. The delegation set a deadline of eight days for the VMC to resolve the issue.
