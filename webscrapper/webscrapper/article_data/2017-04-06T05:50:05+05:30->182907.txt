PATIALA: Gangsters, who were arrested after they had escaped from Nabha jail in November last year, were produced before the court of Patiala additional sessions judge   for framing of charges. One of the accused in the case   alias Pinda could not be produced in the court so the arguments in the matter could not take place and the judge deferred the matter to April 20 for further hearing.

 The accused were brought here from Patiala, Nabha, Kapurthala and Amritsar jails, where they had been shifted after their rearrests over the last four months. During the last hearing the police had moved an application to produce the accused in the court through   for security reasons, but the court had turned down the request.

 The police on March 7 had filed a challan against the accused under various sections of IPC and the   (Prevention) Act. As certain charges under certain sections of law slapped against the accused could only be framed in a higher court, the case was remanded to the district court from Nabha court.
