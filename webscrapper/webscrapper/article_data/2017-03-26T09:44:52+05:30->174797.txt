PANAJI: The   has requested chief minister Manohar Parrikar to file a review petition in the   for relief to all   in the state that are in the vicinity of state and national highways. 

 The association in a letter to Parrikar has pointed out that the Supreme Court judgment doesn’t specify whether the distance of 500m from the edge of the highway should be measured by radius or perpendicular line . And hence the liquor traders have appealed to the government to measure the distance of highway to the liquor shops by accessible roads. “This will give relief to around 100 shops across Goa.”
 
 Dattaprasad Naik, the association’s president, has also requested the government to denotify the existing state highways to major district roads, stating that this would provide relief to 400 liquor shops across Goa in the towns of Valpoi, Sankhali, Bicholim, Assorna, Tivim, Ponda, Shiroda, Sanvordem, Quepem and Sanguem. 
 
 The association has also requested that one year’s time be granted to all affected liquor shop owners to relocate their business premises.
