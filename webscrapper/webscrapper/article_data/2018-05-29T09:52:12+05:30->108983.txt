GUWAHATI: A day after   gave an open invitation to parties to initiate formation of a non-BJP government in Assam to stop the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016,   on Monday said the idea will never fructify as it is not based on reality. 

 "Congress's idea of forming a non-BJP government in the state like in   is purely based on imaginative thinking. A hypothetical situation is being created. This formula is not going to transform into reality because the coalition government is fully committed to the people's mandate," BJP state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass told reporters here.
 
 Saying that the state government will take a stand on the bill after the second draft of   is out on June 30, Dass added, "The alliance is based on a strong commitment and Congress's imaginative formula is not going to make any alterations. The coalition government will continue." He appealed to people to think logically and not get swayed by emotions. 
 
 Asked about BJP   Rituparna Baruah's remark on Sunday that a conspiracy is being hatched by groups with vested interests to tarnish chief minister  's image, Dass said, "I don't know in what context the MLA made this remark. I will find out from the legislator." 
 
 The general secretary of BJP's state unit, Dilip Saikia, said, "Congress is trying to create confusion among people who have given the mandate to the BJP-led coalition government to rule the state for five years. The people will never accept the idea which Congress is propagating." He added that AGP can not team up with Congress as it will be against the very basis on which the regional party was formed.
