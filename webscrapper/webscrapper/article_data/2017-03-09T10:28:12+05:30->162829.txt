MUMBAI: The controversy around almost all the state association officials boycotting the   ( ) awards, after the   ( ) mentioned in the invite that those who were disqualified as per the   must stay away, continued to simmer even on awards night.

 A day after Ramachandra Guha, who's a member of Supreme Court-appointed COA, termed the Karnataka State Cricket Association ( )'s decision to boycott the BCCI event as “petty“ in an interview to TOI, the latter hit back at the historian with vengeance. “I wonder if their love for power is far greater than love for cricket? This is just plumbing the depth of pettiness,” Guha had quipped.
 
 In a stinging letter (a copy of which is with TOI) to Guha on Wednesday ,  , a member of the KSCA managing committee, alleged that Guha's“remarks per se are uncalled for, unnecessary , disdainful, disparaging, despicable and condemnable to say the least.“
 
 The letter went on to state that “as a member of the COA appointed by the SC to supervise the administration of the BCCI (not our association in my opinion), and as a person of public repute far larger than me, it is expected that you (Guha) should've been more mature, measured and sensitive in your remarks and it appears that you have chosen words which are far beyond what we deserve for our alleged crime of boycotting the   function.
 
 “From your statements in the press, it appears that you are taking your job far too seriously and making comments without even understanding the other point of view,“ accuses Raghavan.
