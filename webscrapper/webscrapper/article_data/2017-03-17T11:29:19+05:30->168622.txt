Dev along with Sona and Suhana come out of the room after catching the snake and everyone claps for him. Teachers take all the students for star gazing.
 
  Radha brainwashes Ronita and her mom against the Bose family. She tells them that Bejoy overpowers everyone and Sourav has diabetes.
  
  Dev is about to go to the jungle to throw the snake when Suhana asks her mother Sona to accompany him. The two walk inside the jungle while arguing like always.
  
  
 
  
  Ronit calls Sourav and tells him everything what Radha said. Bejoy overhears.
  
  Dev throws the snake away and both of them start walking in different directions. Sona gets stuck and collapses. Dev runs to her and picks her up.
  
  Bejoy along with Sourav and Asha reaches Dev's house and start shouting. Ishwari scolds Radha for her behaviour. Radha denies having done anything.
  
  Dev takes Sona to a hut near by and lights fire. Sona wakes up and Dev taunts her.
