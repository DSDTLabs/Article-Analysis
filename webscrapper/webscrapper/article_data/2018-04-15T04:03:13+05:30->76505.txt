NEW DELHI:   hit out at PM   for calling it ‘anti-Ambedkar’, saying no amount of aggression on his part can hide the fact that BJP-RSS ideology is inimical to interests of Dalits.

 A day after the PM’s acerbic speech targeting Congress on the Dalit front, AICC spokesperson Kumari   said, “One should not forget what views RSS and its ideologues had about Ambedkar during his lifetime. Congress recognised his expertise and gave him the responsibility of drafting the Constitution. And it is the RSS and   leaders who talk about changing the Constitution Ambedkar wrote. Who puts a question mark on reservation every now and then? Only the RSS ideologues. Modi has no moral right to question Congress.” Selja said paying “lip service to Ambedkar” cannot obscure the truth that BJP was seeking to “erode the legacy of Ambedkar”. 
 
 Congress said Modi’s aggressive bid to reach out to Dalits was prompted by the nationwide mobilisation during the April 2 protests against “dilution” of SC/ST Act.
