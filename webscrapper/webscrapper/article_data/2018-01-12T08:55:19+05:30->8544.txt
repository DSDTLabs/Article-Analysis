SECUNDERABAD: South Central Railways plans to set up three terminal stations at Lingampalli, Cherlapalli and   to reduce the load on existing such stations at Secunderabad, Kacheguda and Nampally. Terminal stations are ones where trains originate from and end after long-distance trips.

 General manager of SCR   has put the final seal on the move after meeting with MPs on Wednesday, said sources.
 
 The project will start off at Cherlapalli station where six platforms will come up from the existing two. Cherlapalli station, currently spread over around 50 acres, needs another 100 for the expansion. “We laid the foundation of the work quickly as land acquisition takes a long time,” said a senior railway official. Development work at Cherlapalli is on at brisk pace. However, the official was unable to say when the project, estimated at ?80 crore here, would be completed at this station.
  
  
 At Nagalapalli station, which comes under Secunderabad division of SCR, railways need around 250 acres for expanding the number of platforms. SCR and state government will carry out a joint survey for this.
 
 Railway officials feel project implementation will be easier at Lingampalli station, which already has six platforms. Facilities like coach maintenance need to come up there.
 
 The three existing terminal stations are extremely busy as most trains running through SCR are scheduled to depart or end trips there. The railway spokesperson said currently 200 express trains, linking various parts of the country, operate via the three stations everyday.
 
 Around 40 trains function through Kacheguda terminal, while another 45 come under Nampally. Secunderbabad takes the maximum load with almost 115 trains originating and ending trips there a day.
