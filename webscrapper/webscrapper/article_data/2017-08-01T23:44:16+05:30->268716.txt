Margao: Poor mobile connectivity and urgent need for internet to complete school assignments resulted in the majority of Loutolim villagers assenting to the installation of mobile towers at a recent gram sabha. Loutolim resident Franky Monteiro told TOI that “three proposals for installing mobile towers were placed before the gram sabha with majority of villagers favouring the installation”. Villagers insisted that the towers be installed far from residential premises and that the locations be identified and placed before the gram sabha for approvals. tnn
