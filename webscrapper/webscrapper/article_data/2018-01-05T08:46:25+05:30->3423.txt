KOLKATA: Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) chairman   permitted   — whose documentary on Nobel laureate Amartya Sen ran into trouble with the board — to retain words like “cow”, “Hindu”, and “Hindutva” in the film, after an “oral hearing” with the filmmaker in Mumbai on Thursday, claimed Ghosh.

 While Ghosh described the hearing for the documentary — ‘The Argumentative Indian’ — as a “pleasant anticlimax” and a “victory for freedom of expression”, Joshi wasn’t available for comment. Other CBFC officials, however, did not rule out chances of Ghosh getting a show-cause notice and being asked to make one “modification”, regarding a reference to “Gujarat”.
 
 The word features in a lecture that Sen delivered at  .
 
 He has been filmed saying, “Why democracy works so well is that the government is not free to have its own stupidities and, in case of Gujarat its own criminalities, without the opposition being howled down and booted out.”
 
 “There is a chance that he will be asked to delete this reference to Gujarat if he wants a U/A certificate for his documentary,” a CBFC insider told TOI. Ghosh, however, said he did not have any idea about the content of the show-cause notice and would take a call on his next course of action only after he gets the notice. Choosing not to comment on the contents of the notice, CBFC CEO   said, “An official show-cause is yet to be issued.”
 
 Ghosh said he was happy with his meeting with Joshi in Mumbai. “It was an unexpectedly pleasurable meeting that went very smooth. The chairman said he loved my documentary and cleared it without any cut. We talked a lot about films in general and poetry,” Ghosh said.
