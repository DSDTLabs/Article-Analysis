NEW DELHI: The   on Friday refused to grant relief to Calcutta high court judge C S   who had sought suspension of its order awarding a six-month jail term to him for contempt of court, saying due process would be followed in the case.

 As Justice Karnan’s lawyer pleaded for an urgent hearing on suspension of the sentence, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India   asked him to first file the petition before the registry and said the case would be heard by the same bench which had held the judge guilty of contempt.
 
 Justice Khehar said it was a “conscious” decision taken by the seven-judge bench and any plea against the order would be heard by the same bench.
 
 Advocate Mathews J Nedumpara, appearing for Justice Karnan who has been evading arrest, tried to hand over the copy of the petition to the Chief Justice, but Khehar refused to accept it.
 
 “We are not the registry. You file the petition before the registry. You cannot keep on handing papers to us. You have to follow the procedure,” Justice Khehar said.
 
 As the Supreme Court is now on summer recess, it is quite unlikely that the seven-judge bench, which had sentenced Justice Karnan, would assemble to hear his plea for suspension of his sentence.
 
 The seven-judge bench of the apex court had on May 9 passed the order sentencing Justice Karnan to jail by holding him guilty of contempt of court and sentencing him to six months’ imprisonment, a day after he defiantly ordered eight Supreme Court judges to be put behind bars.
 
 It had also ordered   police to take him into custody immediately.
