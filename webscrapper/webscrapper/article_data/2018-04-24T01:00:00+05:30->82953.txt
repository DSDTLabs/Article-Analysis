With the second season of 'Khichdi', the amusing Gujarati family with its peculiar characters is back on the small screen. While the show has interesting references to many Bollywood actors, in one of the episodes last week,  , Aatish Kapadia and their team paid a special tribute to Sridevi. Apparently, the episode was shot in November 2017, months before the actress met with a fatal accident in Dubai.
Actor-producer JD Majethia said, “The episode had an interesting gag involving Sridevi. When she passed away in February, we were reluctant to air that part. However, we then felt that there was nothing derogatory about it and we were referring to her in a humour sequence, which actually will be our tribute to the legendary actress. She had once told us that she loved the first season of our show.”
 Supriya Pathak, who plays   on the show, too, has a beautiful memory of the actress. “Around three years ago, I met her on a flight and she literally made me talk like Hansa. It was embarrassing for a moment, but that just showed how much she loved the characters,” recalled Supriya.
