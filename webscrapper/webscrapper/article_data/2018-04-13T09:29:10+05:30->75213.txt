CHANDIGARH: Hisar MP and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader   has sent a legal notice to Haryana cabinet minister   asking him to tender unconditional apology for maligning his reputation by calling him a drug addict. In a statement issued to media on April 3, Vij had alleged that   had “started taking drugs and he should go to some rehabilitation centre.”

 Vij, who is holding the portfolios of health and sports and youth affairs departments, had made the statement after Dushyant had alleged various scams in the health department under Vij.
 
 “Our client who is the youngest MP in the Indian history has a very clean record and image and use of such defamatory language against him has hampered his public image. It is specifically denied that our client has had ever used any narcotic drug or substance, whatsoever in his whole life, and the statement made by you is factually incorrect and a complete blatant lie with mala fide intention to mislead the public and malign his reputation,” mentioned the six-page legal notice sent by Dushyant’s lawyers to Vij.
 
 In the legal notice, Dushyant has made it clear that if Vij failed to tender apology within a week, he would file a civil as well as criminal case of defamation against him.
 
 According to the counsels for Dushyant, the Hisar MP had held a press conference in Chandigarh in March where he had questioned various purchases made by the department of health,   (NHM) and pointed out various irregularities and thus democratically demanded from the government of Haryana to take action against the culprits who are accused of corruption in the matter.
 
 “However, instead of doing your constitutional duty or replying to the contentions raised by my client, you made an extremely offending, degrading and embarrassing statement in the press,” submitted the counsels in the legal notice.
 
 Counsels have also submitted in the notice that Vij’s reference was deliberate, well-thought and calculated plan to malign the reputation of their client, as the same was immediately circulated on various platforms, thereby, causing permanent and irreparable loss of his reputation.
