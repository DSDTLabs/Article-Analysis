CHENNAI: A five-member gang barged into an auditor’s bungalow, tied him up with his wife and made away with at least 150 sovereigns (1.3kg) of gold ornaments worth Rs 36 lakh in Padmavathy Nagar, Tiruvallur, early on Monday. The burglars also escaped with the auditor’s car, Rs 1lakh in cash, two cellphones and a pair of gold-framed spectacles, the police said.

 
 Ramachandran, 67, and his wife  , 60, stay in a house near the Tiruvallur Government Hospital. Police said   heard a knock on the door around 1.30am. When he opened the door, five men barged in and tied up his hands and legs. They tied up his wife too when she heard her husband cry out in surprise and rushed to the hall .
 
 The couple’s son Lokesh, 32, had been staying with them for a few days. While Ramachandran and his wife were asleep on the ground floor,   was sleeping on the first floor. Police said the boy did not hear the commotion as he had shut his bedroom door.
 
 “The couple said the men had masked their faces with strips of cloth and spoke in Hindi,” said a senior police officer. After stealing the valuables in the house, the gang found Ramachandran’s car keys near the bed. Some of the robbers escaped in his car. The couple told police that they heard two cars leave the house, suggesting that the men had arrived in another vehicle.
 
 “Ramachandran and his wife did not raise an alarm as they didn’t want their son harmed. They called out to their son after the gang left and informed the police,” the officer said.
 
 “There was no CCTV camera or watchman in the house, making it an easy target. The couple said they had brought home the jewellery from a bank locker for personal use. Police dogs have been pressed into service,” the officer said, adding that three special teams had been formed to nab the gang.
