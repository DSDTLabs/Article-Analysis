Gurgaon: The city experienced a comparatively warmer Monday, as maximum temperature touched 22°C. 

 An official at the Regional Meteorological Centre attributed the rise in daytime temperature to south-westerly winds, along with clearer skies that allow the full force of solar radiations to reach the earth’s surface. The official, however, added that minimum temperature will continue to remain as low as 6-7°C.
 
 Visibility was slightly lower on Monday morning, but it improved as the day progressed, said the official.
 
 “There is a south-westerly component in the wind. Its direction has changed. Winds are now coming from the Rajasthan side, which are warmer compared to the northerly winds arriving from Jammu and Kashmir. 
 
 “Moreover, clear skies also led to warmer   as there is no obstruction for sunlight,” the official said.
 
 The official further added that maximum temperatures were likely to persist on the higher side for the next few days. “We’re going to have a fairly warm weather for the next few days. The maximum temperature will touch 24-25°C, but the minimum temperature will continue to be low. However, from the evening of January 17, a slight change in weather is expected to take place. Moderate fog will return and visibility will reduce to 200m during the morning of January 18,” the official said.
 
 The official also said the warmer weather was temporary and cold winds might return, which will keep the temperature low. The average concentration of PM 2.5 recorded on Monday was 116.15 µg/m3, an improvement from 132.96 µg/m3 witnessed on Sunday. The Air Quality Index (AQI) on Monday was 263, which is in ‘poor’ category.
