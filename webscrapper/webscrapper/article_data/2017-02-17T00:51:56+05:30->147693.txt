MUMBAI: A retired marine biologist from Goa urged young scientists to learn   to understand the   rooted in vedic shlokas.

 Arvind Untawale from the National Institute of Oceanography was speaking at the Indian Youth Science  , hosted by Mumbai University. 
 
 He said that there are specific vedic shlokas that describe the distance between   including their movement, speed and in-depth information. “So unless we know Sanskrit, we won’t be able to decode that,” he said. 
 
 “We must think about our past, ancient history. In Hindu philosophy, we respect our vedas,” he said. He also said that the youth must also know the contributions of ancient masters.He suggested the merging of the young and old. “We must not forget our past. We must remain there and study,” he said.
