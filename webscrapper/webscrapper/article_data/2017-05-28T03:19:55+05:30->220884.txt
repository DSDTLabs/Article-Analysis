NEW DELHI: A four-year-old child was rescued from Loni after he was abducted from a colony near   in Kalkaji. Police have arrested the child’s neighbor for the kidnapping, who allegedly had a monetary dispute with the child’s father.

 The incident was reported from a JJ camp near the college on Wednesday, when the child’s father approached the cops to register a missing complaint.

Cops found that Israil was missing since the incident.
 
 “A team led by SHO Kalkaji, Ved Prakash was formed to track down the child. We suspected that the accused would take the child to his hometown in Bihar,” said Romil Baaniya, DCP (southeast). 
 
 However, after a few hours, cops received an information about the movement of Israil near the Loni border. He was tracked down with the child and nabbed with the help of an informer. 
 
 During interrogation, Israil claimed that he had planned to take the child to a friend’s house in Loni and then call the parents for ransom. He had planned to kill the child if he did not receive the money. 
 
 A case of kidnapping has been registered against Israil.
