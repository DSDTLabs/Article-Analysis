RANCHI:   across the state will be increased by 15% from Tuesday. The decision to increase the fare was taken during a meeting of members of  , of every district, headed by the Ranchi Bus Owners' Association. 

 Krishna  , president of Ranchi Bus Owners' Association, said, "We are increasing the fare after 2015. It is the demand of the drivers to increase the fair as the rate of diesel has risen and it is not feasible to continue the bus services at the same fare."
 
 In 2015, the rate of one litre diesel was Rs 53; this has now increased to Rs 62.51 now. 
 
 "On an average, a bus gives a mileage of 3km/litre. With the increase in the rate of diesel, it is not possible to continue with the previous fare. The fare has only been increased to meet the price of oil, there has been no extra increase," Singh said.
 
 The fare increase will be implemented on both intra-city and inter city buses. If the fare of an intra-city bus is Rs 10, it will be increased to Rs 11.5. 
 
 Citing an example, Singh said, "The rate of Ranchi-Simdega bus fare, which is Rs 140 at present, will be increased to Rs 181."
