A month ago, someone created a fake Facebook account in the woman’s name and uploaded objectionable videos, some of which were from when the duo was together. These videos were also forwarded to her current employers, colleagues and her relatives. We zeroed in on Grewal and arrested him on Saturday afternoon from Salt Lake’s FE Block,” an officer said.
