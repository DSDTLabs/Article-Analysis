NAGPUR: The   (Athavale), the only Republican faction recognized by the  , denied it was on verge of a split. RPI (A) is a constituent of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the centre in which Ramdas Athavale is a Union minister of state for social justice. The RPI (A) is also an ally of the BJP-Sena government in the state.

 Its state president   said they have approached the local BJP leaders for seat-share in the   elections. “We have demanded 19 seats and would settle for nothing less,” he said. 
 
 More importantly, Thoolkar said his party would contest on its own symbol and not that of the BJP or Sena. It has already sought the cup-saucer as poll symbol from the EC and hopeful of getting it.
 
 The RPI city unit saw some internal tussle last week after   was named as city unit president. A local functionary Balu Gharde declared himself city president and formed his own team and started functioning. On Thursday he even approached the BJP and started talks of seat sharing.
 
 However, Thoolkar, said Gharde would be asked to desist from such activity and he would be given another party post. He ruled out any split in the party. Downplaying Gharde’s rebellion and refusal to accept Waghmare as city president, Thoolkar said he was confident of resolving the dispute amicably.
