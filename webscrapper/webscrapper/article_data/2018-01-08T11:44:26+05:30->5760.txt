 Speaking to TOI general secretary of South Goa Tourist Taxi Association Roque Fernandes alleged that the RTO has been harassing them on the road as well as when they visit the office for renewal of permits. 
 
 “We’ve petitioned chief minister  , ministers, MPs with our genuine issues but there is not sincere approach to resolve them. Hence, we are left with no other option,” said president of North Goa Taxi Association, Vasudev Arlekar. 
 
 Fernandes said they will decide on January 19 whether to continue the strike indefinitely. He said that during the peak season the RTO officers seize their licences on flimsy grounds while on trips. During permit renewal, which has to be done within 8 days, the RTO officers keeping it pending for even a month, during that period we cannot ply the vehicles, he alleged.
