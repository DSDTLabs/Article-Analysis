Visakhapatnam: The finalization of the venue for Dharma Poorata Deeksha has left to the   supremo Chandrababu Naidu by the Visakha Coordination Committee. TDP would conduct Dharama Poorata Deeksha in Vizag on May 22. It is recalled that the TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu had already announced that he would conduct one more deeksha at Vizag after success of Dharma Poorata Deeksha in Tirupati last month.

 The committee members led by deputy chief minister N. Chinna Rajappa and AP TDP president and Minister Kala Venkata Rao along with another minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao, Government whip P Gana Babu and other MLAs discussed about the venue here on Friday.
 
 According to sources, they selected three venues – AU Engineering College, RK Beach and Indira Priyadarsini Stadium in old town. Sources said that first choice of the TDP would be AU Engineering College grounds as per the sentiment. Chandrababu had come into power after he successfully concluded his more than 2300 km ‘Mee Kosam’ Padayatra at AU grounds before 2014 elections and his party successfully conducted Mahanadu, the party plenary, last year in the same grounds.
 
 The coordination committee opined that fixing AU Engineering grounds as the venue will not hamper the university regular activities as the university had declared holidays. But a few members raised their doubts that their own government had taken a decision that AU Engineering College grounds should not be given to any political meetings or programmes.
 
 The deputy CM Rajappa and AP TDP President Kala Venkata Rao had reportedly said the members that they would bring it to the notice of the party president about three venues for the finalization of venue. The coordination committee decided to see that Vizag Sabha should be more successful than Tirupati.
