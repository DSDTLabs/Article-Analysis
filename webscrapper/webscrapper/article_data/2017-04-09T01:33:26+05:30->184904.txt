NAVI MUMBAI: The   fruit wholesale market is flush with   of mangoes but not everyone is happy with the fruit’s arrival. 

 Activist   has filed a complaint about the empty   crates and boxes   by the roadside outside the market complex, on the Turbhe side.
 
 “I have lodged a complaint with NMMC’s citizens’ grievance cell, as it is difficult to walk on the footpath,” said Chauhan. A local civic official said that they are looking into the grievance. 
 
 Traffic inspector P Khade of Turbhe unit told TOI that if the crates are hindering traffic movement, then they will also take action. 
 
 He added that the cops can talk to APMC officials on this issue. 
 
 Meanwhile, traders said that they do pick up the empty boxes, once the supplies have been unloaded.
