Trichy: Sand bullock cart workers association has demanded to open more exclusive quarries for them and claimed that the move will bring down the price of sand, here on Wednesday. CITU affiliated sand bullock cart workers association asked the Trichy district administration and the mining division of Public Works Department to consider their appeal to set up quarries in Lalgudi, No 1 toll gate, Thottiyam, Pettavaithalai, Ayyalammanpadithurai, Murungapettai and Vengur across Cauvery and Kollidam rivers. They stated that the increase in quarries will help reduce the sand price and also cited the inconvenience caused as they depend on the only quarry in Sarkarpalayam across Cauvery River in Trichy city. “As many as 250 bullock carts from various places in Trichy take sand from Sarkarpalayam and supply them to several parts. They sell them for Rs 1500 per load (15 cubic feet). If sand quarries are opened in few more places, the sand price will further come down,” said the district president of the association G K Ramar. PWD mining division opened the quarry in Sarkarpalayam on April 21 following the series of demonstrations by the bullock cart workers and owners to have an exclusive quarry for them for their survival. The new facility was set up following the Supreme Court’s interim stay on the ban on sand mining by the Madras high court. Since then the opening of the new quarry, the sand miners are facing a lot of objections from local influential people who are attempting to prevent bullock carts from taking sand and passing through their village. The issue was at its peak on April 25 with the local intercepting them. Eventually, the intervention of revenue officials through peace talks brought a temporary solution to the issue. The association also said that the additional quarries will help around 5,000 bullock cart workers to get sand in a free and fair manner and also avoid unnecessary altercation with the local people of the particular area.
