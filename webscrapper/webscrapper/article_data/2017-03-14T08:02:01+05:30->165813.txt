BENGALURU: All apprehensions that the Rs 2100-crore steel flyover, which was shelved by the government earlier this month, could make a comeback were laid to rest on Monday.

 The Chennai bench of the   (NGT) has confirmed that the proposed steel flyover is an area development project which needs mandatory environmental clearance. The court directed the   (BDA) not to proceed with it without prior environment clearance. The NGT pronounced its judgment on an application filed by Citizen Action Forum ( ) and  , former additional chief secretary of Karnataka. It directed the BDA, the executing agency, not to proceed with the project without prior green nod.
 
 The petitioners had challenged the legality of the project and said that it should be classified under Entry 8(b) of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006. The project was proposed by the BDA and was to be implemented by L&T. The NGT upheld that the steel flyover project qualifies as an area development activity.
 
 The Karnataka government, BDA and the state environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA) had strongly opposed both the application filed by CAF and the project's classification as an area development activity .The BDA had argued that it was a road expansion project and was, therefore, outside the purview of any prior environmental clearance. According to the EIA Notification 2006, projects falling within the definition of an area develop ment activity require environmental clearance before their commencement.
 
 On March 2, Bengaluru development minister   announced the scrapping of the controversial flyov er project. The government decision came amid allegations that kickbacks had been paid to the Congress high command in New Delhi and chief minister Siddaramaiah's family.
