BENGALURU:   CEO   told employees in his first address that each one of them has an important role to play in today’s world of continuous technological disruptions, and that this could be done by reskilling themselves.

 Parekh, who joined Infosys on Tuesday, said in the video address that he met a few “exceptional Infoscions” in the morning and promised to work together to accelerate the change that is reshaping the Indian IT industry. “I am excited to lead the company on its path of helping clients digitally reinvent themselves for sustained business growth. This area has a great scope for each of us to put forth our best. We will work together to accelerate our transformations,” the former Capgemini executive said.
 
 Reskilling has become the buzz word in the IT industry as automation makes a number of entry level jobs redundant and as demand rises for skills in a host of new fields including cloud, machine learning, artificial intelligence, internet-of-things and blockchain.
 
 Former CEO   had similarly urged employees last year to embrace automation and be innovative to survive the rapid and disruptive changes in the world of technology or else be “made obsolete by the tidal wave of automation and technology-fuelled transformation.”
 
 Parekh, on his first day at the campus at Electronic City, interacted with a few employees. Some managed to get selfies with their new superboss. “All the best wishes, Salil,” co-founder   tweeted on Tuesday. “He is an insider. He knows how to respect and treat people well,” a press agency reported former Infosys chief financial officer Mohandas Pai as saying, an apparent dig at Sikka, who had major issues with some of the founders.
