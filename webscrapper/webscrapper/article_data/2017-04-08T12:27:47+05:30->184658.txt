NASHIK: The  's move to pass the   ( ) bill on Thursday has brought   across the district. The bill will clear the way for   which were banned in 2014. 

 "We welcome the state's decision to allow the bullock cart races. Organisers in Taloshi village are exited. We have already started preparing for it by making race tracks," said Ramesh Patil, village head of Taloshi village in the Igatpuri tehsil.
 
 This village will host the annual fair of Shankar Maharaj in May first week. While organisers in Taloshi are gearing up for the race, owners of bulls popular for the race have started rigorous practice sessions with their bulls. 
 
 Brahmadev Shinde, a Sinnar-based farmer said, "We have six runner bulls of Khillar breed in our herd and they have been sitting idle for the last three years. We still take good care of them. At least four of my bulls will run this season."
 
 Shinde was leading the agitation of farmers against the ban on bull racing in Nashik. He said the Nashik and Ahmednagar districts have over 2,000 racing bulls that are worth Rs 48 crore.
 
 A large number of villages in western Maharashtra will host annual fairs between the Marathi months of Vaishakh and Ashadha that falls between May and July. "We are very happy. There will be no injury to the participating bulls in the races. We have decided to take a video of the race in Chandwad. The footage will be available to cross check," said Nitin Pawar, a member of the race organising committee in Chandwad. PETA activists in Nashik have issued an official statement saying that they will study the amendment allowing bull races and challenge it in an appropriate court of law.
