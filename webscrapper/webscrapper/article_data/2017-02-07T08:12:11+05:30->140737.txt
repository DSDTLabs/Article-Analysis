HYDERABAD:   has had a great start to the year with star-studded movies becoming major hits. Not only in India, but collections even in the US have been soaring. 

 "It has been a great take off this year. Every sector of the film industry is happy," said former president of   M Vijayendar Reddy, who is an exhibitor (theatre owner) himself.
 
 Chiranjeevi who returned to the screen after a 10-year sabbatical dished out his 150th film 'Khaidi No. 150' directed by V V Vinayak. The film, released on January 11, has done extremely well at the box-office. On January 12, Balakrishna-starrer 'Gautamiputra Shatakarni' released to packed houses.
 
 While the two big releases were slated for Sankranti, there was no major problem. "Since the distributor was the same for both the films here, the two films had enough theatres to run in," an exhibitor said.
 
 Sharwanand-starrer 'Sathamanam Bhavathi', released on January 14, also clicked at the box-office. Not just around Sankranti, but even after it Nani-starrer 'Nenu local' (released on February 3) made a mark.
 
 According to film sources' estimation, collections of 'Khaidi No. 150' crossed 130 crore, collections of 'Gautamiputra Shatakarni' are at 80 crore and 'Shathamanam Bhavati' is going great guns with collections touching 30 crore already. 
 
 Commenting about the situation in the US around Sankranti, film trade analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted, "They (Telugu films) eclipsed all Hindi films including new ones." On January 16, he said, "It was an incredible extended weekend for Telugu films in US. The business of the three new films is 25.66 cr in US."K Ashok Kumar, member, Telugu Film Producers' Council, said, "One of the main reasons why these films have been a hit is that filmmakers are dishing out the right content after demonetisation."
