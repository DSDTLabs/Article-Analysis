PATNA: The state government has clarified that newly appointed   K S   was not held responsible even by the courts for the riots that killed 900 people in Bhagalpur when he was the district’s SP in 1989.

 Referring to the adverse reaction of a section of politicians to the appointment of Dwivedi as the DGP, principal secretary (home)   recalled the riots had been probed by the Justice (retd) R N Prasad commission. While Justice (retd) Prasad had concluded that Dwivedi and other police officers acted in an unbiased manner, the other two members of the commission — Justice (retd)   and Justice (retd) S   — had made adverse comments against them in a separate report.
 
 “Dwivedi and the other indicted cops moved the Patna high court and a division bench of Justice B P Singh and Justice B P Sharma on December 12, 1996 expunged all the adverse remarks made against them by the two inquiry committee members. It also ordered government not to consider those adverse remarks for any action against Dwivedi and the other cops,” Subhani said at a press conference on Thursday.
 
 He further said the   upheld the Patna high court’s judgement, rejecting the state government’s appeal against the Patna HC’s order.
 
 “There is no administrative fault in the selection of Dwivedi as the DGP,” Subhani said and added nor was there any political pressure on the state government for appointing Dwivedi as the new DGP.
