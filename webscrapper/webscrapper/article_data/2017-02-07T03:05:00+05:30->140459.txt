Amravati: Staying true to his words, state home minister Dr Ranjit Patil performed ‘operation election’ to perfection, posting a resounding win over his nearest rival and state Congress general secretary, Sanjay Khodke, to retain the Amravati division graduates’ constituency seat in style on Monday. It was a clean sweep by Patil, who had told ToI in an interview that he was his own competitor and would win by a record margin. The minister lived up to his words as he completed the quota of first preference votes in the fourth round itself, polling 71,006 votes as against Khodke’s 29,282. He polled an average 18,000 votes in each of the first four rounds before ending with a final tally of 78,051 in the fifth and final round as against Khodke’s 34,154. Contrary to speculations, it turned out to be a thoroughly ‘one man show’. Not only Khodke but also the other two serious contenders in Prof Deepak Dhote of Prahar and independent Dr Avinash Chaudhary could cut no ice and literally finished among the also-rans. There were total 13 in fray. This is the second consecutive win for Patil from this constituency. He had defeated NUTA giant Prof BT Deshmukh in 2010. There were 1.68 lakh voters back then out of which 58,000 had exercised their franchise and Patil had polled 28,000 as against Deshmukh’s 19,000. This time, there were 2,10,511 voters out of which 1,33,857 had cast their votes. Of these, 1,23,386 were declared valid while 10,154 invalid. There were 467 voters who rejected all candidates. The quota was fixed at 61,681, which Patil completed in the fourth round itself. Patil won by 43,897 votes, which is a record margin. It was a thumping win for Patil, who headed strongly ahead right from the moment the actual counting began at the badminton hall of Jawahar stadium here in the afternoon. Khodke was nowhere in the race from round one.  A jubilant BJP is in a buoyant mood now as it expects Patil’s win to create a positive wave for the upcoming municipal corporation, ZP and panchayat samiti polls in the division. Divisional Commissioner and Returning Officer JP Gupta handed over the certificate to Patil. Election observer Vijay Deshmukh was also present on the occasion.
