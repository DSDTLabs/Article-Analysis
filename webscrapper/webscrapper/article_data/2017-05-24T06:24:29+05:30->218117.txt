NEW DELHI: A total 129 Group A and Group B officers of the central government have been sacked over the past one year for non-performance,   minister of state for personnel   said on Tuesday. 

 The “compulsory retirement” of 30 Group A and 99 Group B officers — ordered under Rule 56(J) of CCS   Rules, 1972 — is an outcome of an ongoing review of service record of 24,415 Group A officers and 42,521 Group B officers over the past few months. The review had found the said officers to be ‘deadwood’, based on adverse inputs obtained from their respective departments, leading the department of personnel and training to order their compulsory retirement for service “in public interest”. 
 
 The Centre had in January terminated a senior IAS officer on grounds of non-performance. Earlier in 2014, graft-tainted IAS couple in Madhya Pradesh, Arvind and  , were dismissed from service. Singh, while briefing media on the achievements of departments under his charge, said the government has zero-tolerance policy towards graft and is committed to ensure citizen-centric governance. The Centre, he said, is working on finalising amendments to the Lokpal Act, primarily to plug the inadequacies in the Act drafted by the   government.
