SURAT: The   ( ) is all set to launch trading of diamonds on the commodity exchange, first time in the world, starting from April 1. 

 “We are launching three separate monthly diamond contractors starting from April 1. Diamond contracts will allow the diamantaires to decide their own prices for the diamonds, and not someone sitting thousands of miles away in New York,” said managing director and CEO of ICEX, Sanjit Prasad. 
 
 Polished diamond will be traded for the first time in the world on commodity exchange and Surat will be the delivery centre. The ICEX has tied up with International   (IIDGR), subsidiary of world giant De Beers in Surat, for grading and packing of diamonds. 
 
 After the Government of India notified diamonds as the commodity for trading, the   ( ) gave ICEX permission to launch diamond contractors. The ICEX team have been organizing mock tests starting from February 14 to March 15, with the daily volume of diamonds trading at a whooping Rs 10,000 crore by over 2,500 clients. 
 
 Talking to TOI, GJEPC’s regional chairman, Dinesh Navadiya said, “The diamond trading on ICEX will largely benefit the small players in the industry. The small traders will get more value of their diamonds and they will not have to depend on the international agencies for diamond pricing. Moreover, the trading will safeguard diamantaires from securing bank finance through loan against contracts”
 
 ICEX will be initially launching three contracts for the stones sized 30 cent, 50 cents and 1 carat. It has also tied up with International Institute of Diamond Grading and Research (IIDGR), a 100 per cent subsidiary of global major De Beers based in Surat, for grading and packing of the diamonds.
