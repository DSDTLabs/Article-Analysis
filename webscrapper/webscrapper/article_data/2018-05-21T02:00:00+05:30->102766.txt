 Singh said several of his family members were present when the argument took place after which the girl left. However, he feigned ignorance if the girl had reached his house on her own or any of his sons had called her.
 
 Singh said Sushant is his youngest son. Prashant is his second son and has a franchise of a global travel agency in  .
 
 The MLC said the girl had come to Prashant’s office on several occasions in the last three to four months for travelling tickets. “Initially, I knew that she had studied with Sushant, but it is not true,” he said and added, “Policemen reached my residence on Sunday and I told them the same,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, police sources said the girl has been called many times for recording her statement before the investigating officer since Saturday, but she did not turn up making some excuses. “She alleged about injuries but did not turn up even for medical examination,” police said.
