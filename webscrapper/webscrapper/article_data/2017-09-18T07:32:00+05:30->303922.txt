Amritsar: He may be a political novice but Maj Gen Suresh Khajuria (retd), AAP’s pick for Gurdaspur Lok Sabha byelection, is banking upon the support of ex-servicemen, his local background and alleged failure of both state Congress and Centre’s BJP government for his victory in the vote test slated for October 11.

 Talking to TOI after announcement of his name by AAP’s leadership on Sunday, Khajuria said that, “People of Gurdaspur Lok Sabha constituency have to make a choice between a local candidate who lives with them and knows their issues and outsiders who make promises, win elections and hardly return to constituency to fulfil them.” Outsiders had been representing this constituency at the Centre for past several years but now people had a chance to elect someone from among them, he said.
 
 Khajuria said that people of his constituency didn’t want promises only but also wanted to see their dreams turn into reality. “This area, up to Dunear is underdeveloped, there is lack of educational and medical infrastructure, textile mills and industry has shifted to the neighbouring hill state of Himachal Pradesh. Nothing has been done to develop these areas so far,” he said.
 
 Born at Bungal village, near Pathankot, Khajuria said he would suggest employing ex-servicemen for security services since Gurdaspur Lok Sabha constituency was a border constituency and very sensitive. 
 
 Meanwhile, state vice-president of AAP Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said the party had convened a meeting of its MLAs and other state leadership in Gurdaspur before filing nomination papers of Khajuria on September 21. All assembly constituencies, including Pathankot, Dinanagar, Qadian, Batala, Fatehgarh Churian, Dera Baba Nanak, Gurdaspur, Sujanpur and Bhoa would be divided into three zones each and two MLAs would be given charge of each constituency. Divulging AAP’s campaign plans, he said that they would lay more stress on door-to-door and corner meetings over big rallies.
