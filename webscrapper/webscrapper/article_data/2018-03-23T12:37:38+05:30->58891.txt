PANAJI: Urban development minister Francis D’Souza on Thursday said mining dependants who agitated in the capital city on Monday were bent on disruption and failed to consider the concerns of the public.

 “Permission (for the protest) was not taken. They (mining dependants) were called for a meeting to discuss the route and assembly points of the protest, but they didn’t attend,” D’Souza told reporters on the sidelines of a programme held to mark the 175th anniversary of   being elevated to the status of a city. 
 
 The minister said he told the chief secretary that the recurrence of such a situation must not be allowed. “The Mandovi bridge can’t be blocked every time. That’s the worst thing to happen. We have to keep the lifeline open,” he said, even as he put the onus on the state administration to decide if the agitators should be booked. “We have to show concern for the agitators as well as members of the general public. The protesters didn’t understand that the government has always been on their side,” he said.
 
 While agreeing that everyone had a right to agitate,   (EDC) chairman Sidharth Kuncalienker, said there were ways and means to do so. “People were slapped,their bike keys were thrown away and curses were hurled at them. Hundreds of students were also stranded at the Cujira integrated school complex. No agitation should take such a turn,” he said. 
 
 The former Panaji MLA also said the taxi owners who created chaos on the day “should all be booked as per law”. “I feel whoever has broken the law should be booked with stringent measures as per the law,” he said.
