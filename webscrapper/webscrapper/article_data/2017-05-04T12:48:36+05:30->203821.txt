The filmmaker was overheard mentioning the actor-comedian to one of the show’s unit members after “thoroughly enjoying” his special gag with former The Kapil Sharma Show co-star Ali Asgar.

  “He might approach Sunil for one of his upcoming films and write an interesting role for him,” the source added.
  
  In an earlier interview to Mirror (April 27), Sunil had said, “I am open to doing more films because I’m not a comedian. It’s very difficult to be one. I am an actor who makes caricatures out of characters.” Maybe Anurag’s film will be the calling card Sunil has been waiting for ever since his unceremonious departure from Kapil Sharma’s show?
