 A magistrate court in Bengaluru on Monday gave its go-ahead for subjecting K T   alias Hotte Manja, who has been arrested in connection with the murder of journalist-activist  , to narco analysis test. The 3rd additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) court allowed the Special Investigation Team (SIT), probing the   killing to conduct narco analysis after the accused gave his consent to the test.

 Advocate A   said Naveen Kumar discussed with him about the impact of narco analysis on Sunday. “He is innocent and has been framed in the case. He has agreed to the test, hoping that he will be set free after his innocence is proved. Naveen wants truth to come out and hence gave his consent,” Vedamurthy told
