The  , an annual   road trip organized by a city-based skateboarding collective every January, was bigger and better this year — than it has ever been. The third edition, which kicked off from   in Bengaluru on January 22, not only saw the largest number of participants — increasing the number of buses from one to two, and a follow truck too — but it also included new venues, skateboarding sessions for government school kids, surfing sessions, BMX bikes and a whole bunch of fun activities, before returning to the city.
Speaking about the tour,  , one of the founders of the collective, says, “Compared to previous years, this year’s tour was a lot higher on energy and enthusiasm, thanks to the large number of participants. Also, newer activities such as surfing, BMX and workshops made it very interesting. It’s been less than a week since we got back, and we’re already looking forward to the next one.”
