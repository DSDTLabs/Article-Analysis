CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh Car Dealers Association on Sunday held a   march at   roundabout demanding the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation to provide a suitable place to run the second-hand cars business.

 Several car dealers raised slogans against the   seeking to shift the car market from the   area because of its poor law and order conditions. They threatened to gherao the MC office if their demands were not met.
 
 Car dealers association president Gulshan Kumar said, “Ten months ago, the MC had shifted the car bazaar from sector 7 to the Ram Darbar area near Hallo Majra. Since then, the businesses of many have been stalled completely. In Sector-7 car bazaar market, dealers used to showcase approximately 2,000 cars, but here they can accommodate only 500 cars. The poor law and order situation in the area is also scaring away the customers.”
 
 “We have met with many high officials, but to no effect. We will continue the protest and gherao the MC office if they pay no heed to our demand,” Kumar added.
 
 The members said due to the closure of the market, the dealers have suffered losses of Rs 3-5 crore.
