KOLKATA: The officer on special duty ( ) to mayor   claimed he has lost $ 299.95, which is roughly around Rs 21,000, through his credit card that he has been operating for the past 15 years. Amlan Dutta registered a case in this regard with both the New Market police and the anti-bank fraud cell of Kolkata Police.

 
 According to Dutta, he received a message informing him about the   on Wednesday evening. “I did not get any OTPs, nor any phising calls. When I lost the money and contacted the bank, where I have not defaulted once, the authorities did nothing and showed no concern at my loss. I am worried that my   has reached foreign shores,” Dutta told 
 .
 
 Police suspect this might be a case of skimming. “Skimming is a type of fraudulent activity that involves installation of additional hardware on ATM with the purpose of stealing credit card-related information from users. After receiving the data, a copy of the credit card is created and used to withdraw the money. Malware, credit card scanners and video cameras can be used for this purpose. Not only ATMs but also chip and pin machines in restaurants and supermarkets can become the breach point,” claimed a senior officer.
 
 Police sources said the probe will include going through call details and bank statements. “In January 2018, a similar case had unearthed a unique modus operandi, which bears testimony to how bank’s processes can be flouted and the manner in which personal data enough to lead one to your personal bank accounts are up for sale. We have to look into the possibility of a rerun for the gang,” said an officer. According to cops, such cases are frequent in the city.
 
 “The sad part is that your only way out is to get into a loop of justice-seeking that may take years together by which time the money you have lost would lose value and you would have done the running around that's worth much more. A small relief is that your credit score doesn't get affected,” said an officer.
