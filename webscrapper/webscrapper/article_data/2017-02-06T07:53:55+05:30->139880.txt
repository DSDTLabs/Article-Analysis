BENGALURU: The joint session of the legislature beginning Monday promises to kick up a lot of heat and dust. Opposition parties are planning to raise issues like Sunday's custodial death of a truck driver at Lakshmeshwar, Gadag, income tax raids on small-scale industries minister   and   chief  's premises last month, falling foodgrain prices and drought. 

 The opposition is likely to question the government on the law-and-order situation following the incidents of molestation against women in Bengaluru.
 
 On its part, the Siddaramaiah government is likely to counter principal opposition BJP by accusing the central government of being indifferent to the concerns of Karnataka, especially over the quantum of drought relief and delay in its release. Last week, Siddaramaiah said the Centre had promised to release Rs 1,750 crore, but there was no sign of the money.
 
 The ruling party is also likely to reiterate Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reluctance to mediate in solving interstate river water issues like Mahadayi or Cauvery.
 
 The first sitting of the five-day session in this new calendar year will begin with governor Vajubhai Vala's address. There are voices of criticism over the decision to convene the opening session for five days, instead of the customary 15 days. According to secretariat sources, the house sat for 34 days last year, in contrast to 59 in 2015.
 
 This session has come at a time when both Congress and BJP are facing rebellion within their camps. While the ruling party is facing dissidence after veteran leader S M Krishna quit in a huff, resentment within the BJP continues against state president B S Yeddyurappa's style of functioning.
 
 While Yeddyurappa claimed that Krishna will join BJP, Krishna's supporters have nixed such claims, saying "it's a conspiracy by BJP to create rift in the party''.
