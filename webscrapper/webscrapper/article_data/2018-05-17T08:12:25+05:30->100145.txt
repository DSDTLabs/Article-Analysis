KOLKATA: The Centre sought a detailed report on the panchayat polls yet again on Wednesday, a day after Prime Minister   took “serious note” of the violence hit polls, calling it a “murder of democracy” on Tuesday.

 
 According to Nabanna officials, the PM’s unprecedented comment followed by the MHA’s missive has cast a shadow on CM Mamata Banerjee’s scheduled visit to   on May 25, where she is scheduled to share the stage with the PM and Bangladesh Prime Minister  . While the   is yet to confirm Banerjee’s visit, Visva-Bharati officials are hoping against hope that she will finally make it to the inauguration of Bangladesh Bhawan on the campus built with Bangladesh funds.
 
 The MHA is not satisfied with the “incomplete and sketchy” report the state submitted to the Centre in reply to the Centre’s missive two days ago on Monday, seeking a report on the panchayat polls. Chief secretary   will send a detailed report to the Centre.
 
 The panchayat polls in   caught eyeballs after 15 casualties were reported from the districts on the day of polling on May 14, though the state election commission took cognisance of six poll-related deaths.
 
 The PM’s unprecedented response came after people from all walks of life resented the violence. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh also wrote to the PM narrating incidents of violence and documenting the loss of life in violence. Even opposition parties in Bengal — Congress, CPM and PDS — will approach Calcutta High Court against the violence.
