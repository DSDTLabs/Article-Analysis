PUNE: Fifteen patients admitted in a first floor  , off   bypass, were evacuated and placed in an open area for 20 minutes after fire broke out in a locked software company located on the second floor of the building on Monday morning.

 Nobody was injured in the incident. Office furniture, computers, and storage material were gutted in the incident.
 
 Station fire officer   told TOI the city fire brigade received the emergency call at 7.41 am and three fire tenders were rushed to the spot.
 
 “The fire broke out in a three-storey commercial building, housing the hospital on the first floor and a software company on the second floor. Around 15 patients were in the hospital and one of them was on life support,” Memane said.
 
 The authorities decided to evacuate the patients when they spotted dense smoke emanating from the second floor of the building where two cooking gas cylinders were found.
 
 “We requested the hospital administration to shift the patient to an open area located in between the bypass and the building. The patients were evacuated within minutes. Only one patient, who was on life support, was allowed to stay in the hospital,” he said.
 
 A few months ago, the company had shut down its operations but the office bearers had not shifted the computers, office furniture, glass panes and other articles from the premises. “The software company authorities had not shut down the power supply to the battery back-up and it is suspected that the short circuit took place at the power back up system,” Memane said.
 
 A team of 15 firemen and three tenders rushed to the spot. At first, the two cylinders were taken out safely and the fire was doused around 10.30 am. “The fire emitted dense smoke due to plastic components in the software company,” he said.
