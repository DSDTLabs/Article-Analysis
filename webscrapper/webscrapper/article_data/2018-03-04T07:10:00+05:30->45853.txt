Ludhiana: A 35-year-old married man attempted to rape an eight-year-old neighbour on Saturday, while she was alone at home. The accused barged into her house, took her into the bathroom, and attempted to rape her. However, she raised an alarm, following which neighbours caught hold of the accused.

 In his complaint to the police, the girl’s father — a migrant labourer — said he and his wife were out on work on Saturday morning, while their daughter was alone at home, when their neighbour barged into their house. He said his daughter was playing outside, but the accused took her into the bathroom from behind the house, and attempted to rape her. He added that his daughter then raised an alarm, and on hearing her screams, nearby residents rushed to the spot to rescue her. They informed her parents, thrashed the accused, and handed him over to the police.
 
 Investigating officer Resham Singh said the accused worked in a factory, and was known to the girl. He added that the police had received a complaint, and were investigating the matter.
