PUNE: Three motorcycle-borne men were arrested at Lonikalbhor on Tuesday within 20 hours after they allegedly robbed a grocery   of his bag containing Rs 3.30 lakh on Monday night. 

 A police team led by assistant inspector Sandip   arrested Imran Jamadar (29) of Handewadi Road, Tausif Shaikh (19) of Kalepadal in Hadpasar and   (22) of Lonikalbhor following a tip-off. The shopowner, Deepak Agarwal (39) has lodged a complaint with the Hadapsar police.
 
 Deshmane told TOI that Agarwal was returning home on a scooter with his mother after closing his shop around 10.45pm on Monday. “He had kept the last few days’ collection worth Rs 3.30 lakh in a bag, which was with his mother,” he said.
 
 When mother-son duo reached Amar Baug Society around 11pm, the suspects who were riding on a motorcycle came near Agarwal’s scooter. “One of the pillion riders snatched the bag from Agarwal’s mother before fleeing the spot,” the officer said.
 
 After receiving the complaint, the Hadapsar police began collecting information about the suspects. “After receiving a tip-off, we arrested the trio from Lonikalbhor,” Deshmane said, adding that during their questioning, the suspects admitted to their involvement in the crime.
 
 “We are yet to recover the cash as the investigation is still going on,” he said.
 
 The officer said before targeting Agarwal, the trio had kept a watch on his activities. “They had carried out a recce of his daily routine, including the route he takes to reach home. It is likely they may have noticed Agarwal keeping money in the bag and handing it over to his mother on Monday,” Deshmane said.
 
 The police are verifying whether the trio have any previous criminal records, he said.
