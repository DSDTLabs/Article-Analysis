AMRITSAR: Uttar Pradesh’s ADGP (law and order) Anand Kumar arrived at Amritsar on Friday to investigate the incident of an alleged deal made by an IGP-rank police officer of his state, to let the key accused of Nabha jailbreak incident Gurpreet Singh alias Gopi   escape from police custody in Lucknow.

 On September 20, UP chief minister Yogi Aditiyanath had ordered an inquiry into alleged palm greasing of the police officer. Confirming the arrival of ADGP Kumar, Punjab’s anti-terror squad (ATS) chief   told TOI that the UP officer had interrogated the accused, already arrested in the case, and also exchanged information with the Punjab ATS.
 
 Punjab police had arrested Gurpreet Singh, Balwinder Singh and Randeep Singh Rimple, a liquor contractor, from Amritsar, while Harjinder Singh, Amandeep Singh and Sandeep Tiwari alias Pintoo were arrested from different parts of UP for their involvement in procuring money for Ghanshampuria’s release.
 
 Apart from being a key accused in the Nabha jailbreak case of November 2016, Ghanshampuria is also wanted for kidnsapping an Ajnala-based doctor Munish Kumar.
 
 Investigations carried out so far have revealed that gangster Baljinder Singh alias Dholi, who is lodged in the Amritsar Central Jail, had links with Ghanshampuria. He allegedly contacted Rimple to arrange money for Ghanshampuria’s release. Another gangster Rubal, who has still not been arrested by police, allegedly carried the deal money to UP.
