Navi Mumbai: Two adult Indian rock pythons were   from separate places within   taluka on Friday by an animal rights group. The pythons—around 8 foot and 6.5 foot long—were found inside two compounds. They could have slithered their way into the city in search of small prey like rodents or chicken.

 An animal activist said, “Villagers often keep free-range poultry birds, goats and other farm animals in their houses. These large sized pythons had probably come in search of food.” The rescued reptiles have now been released in to the wild close to Chirner. Just a fortnight ago, a huge python was spotted by tribals in Uran. Earlier this month, a venomous krait had also made its way into Kharghar. “Due to the hilly and green terrain of Navi Mumbai, there are several   species co-existing here. However, locals must not harm them. They must inform snake rescuers or the local fire brigade,” said activist Raghunath Jadhav.
