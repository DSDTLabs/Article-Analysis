 The four occupants of the car suffered minor injuries because of airbags. Its driver also managed to control the speed of the vehicle. They were treated in a private hospital and discharged in the evening.
 
 The residents of Dalas village rushed to the spot after the accident and used gas cutter to break open the SUV. The police had to stop vehicular movement on the highway for an hour to carry out the rescue operation.
 
 Another police officer said the road condition had improved in the past two years. “We have been observing that commuters drive vehicles at a very high speed without paying much attention to other factors, including the vehicle condition,” he said.
