BELAGAVI: The BJP appears to using the same elections strategy in Karnataka that it successfully deployed assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat.

 The party has tasked its workers with collecting information — however minute — about the electorate. As many as 280 active leaders from seven states have been deployed in Karnataka to monitor the collection drive. Each leader monitors one assembly constituency, while members of polling booth committees are in charge of collecting the information. There is even a supervisory team of six leaders.
 
 Party sources say that about 25% of the leaders deployed are from Maharashtra and others are from Goa, Gujarat, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Telangana. BJP national president   has instructed these leaders to collect information on each voter and submit a detailed report by April 10.
 
 Prasad Khobare, ZP member of Kolhapur district, said his team has collected details of about 60% of the electorate in Hanagal constituency in Haveri district. “I monitor the booth level committees, while they work fulltime on this project,” Khobare said. 
 
 The information includes the number of houses in each polling centre, voters in each house, employed or unemployed, caste and religion, age, gender, number of temples and mosques, names of priests, contact numbers of all prominent personalities etc. 
 
 Khobare said the BJP pays great importance to foundation work since it helps leaders connect with common people. He said the information will also help in selecting candidates.
