KOLKATA: A 23-year-old homeless youth with an injured leg lay unattended on a   road for five days till he was rescued by a local on Sunday. The rescuer himself lost an arm in a train accident four years ago.

 Ashok  , a resident of Sukantanagar, said he was having tea at a stall near HB Block when he heard about the youth lying on the median divider near tank No. 12 with an injured right leg for the past five days. Some local labourers had given him a blanket and some food, but none had taken him to a doctor. 
 
 “I found him in pain. He said people, including policemen, came and asked him what he was doing there. But they left on learning he was homeless. The festering wound on his leg made no difference to them,” said Chowdhury.
 
 Chowdhury took   to  . Doctors were initially reluctant to admit him, but later gave in to the pressure. “On Monday, however, a doctor asked me to take him to  . He said the youth had acute septicaemia and gangrene and may need amputation,” Chowdhury added.
 
 He took Mondal to NRS Hospital on Monday, where again doctors allegedly refused to treat him. But he was finally admitted around 7pm. 
 
 Mondal was lying on a raised divider between two flanks of 1A crossroad at FE Block, frequented by thousands every day. “People passed by me holding handkerchiefs to their nose. Cops asked me if I was drunk, but left on seeing I was injured. It was only this babu who helped me ,” said Mondal, adding he was hit by a car last Wednesday night.
 
 Chowdhury, however, said: “I didn’t do something extraordinary by helping him.”
