Speaking at a function in the city on Sunday to launch a nationwide   called India Health Line in the state, Togadia said   will be made available to the poorest sections of society through a pool of 'health ambassadors' and network of VHP volunteers. 

 "Earlier Trishul used to be in my hand. I had left my stethoscope way back in 1988. Now I have taken taken it up again looking at the grim picture of health condition of Indians," Togadia, also a cancer surgeon, said.
 
 "One-third of our country's population is suffering from diseases. Most of these diseases are because of drastic changes in lifestyle. Government's GDP spending on health is less than 2%. I have floated IHL to serve healthcare to the poorest people in the country. Already 10,000 doctors in various parts of the country have joined IHL. My target is to bring 50,000 doctors who will treat patients free of cost," Togadia said.
 
 Togadia, known for fiery speeches leaning towards religion, added, "We will only ask patient's name and economic status, not his or her religion."
