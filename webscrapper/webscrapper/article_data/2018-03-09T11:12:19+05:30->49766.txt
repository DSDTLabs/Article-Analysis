SAMBALPURr: The discovery of an ancient stone idol of   on the banks of the   by a team of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage could provide historians with crucial information that could go on to show that  's history dates back to more than a thousand years. 

 A team from  , which is currently engaged in documenting the civilisations along the Mahanadi in Chhattisgarh, Cuttack district and Sambalpur, were informed of the statue by locals of Durgapali area on the outskirts of Sambalpur city.
 
 "They told us of a statue of Nataraj by the river. It was partially buried when we went to the site. Upon primary observation, the stone idol appears to be more than a thousand years old. It could belong to the seventh or eighth century AD, though to pin it down exactly is difficult without proper procedure," said  , a member of INTACH's Sambalpur chapter.
 
 Sambalpur is an old city, said Panda. "However, we only have archeological evidence from the city which date back to 1500 AD and not further back. But the Nataraj idol - the likes of which are usually found in temples - could open up a path that could lead us to the ancient history of the city," said Panda.
 
 Panda said people in the area had earlier found remains of more sculptures from the same venue from where the Nataraj idol was recovered. "The locals had kept the remains of the discovered sculptures in a newly built temple. We examined the remains but found that the sculptures had been defaced," he added.
