INDORE: An  , perseverance, and practise is a must for the  , said santoor maestro Padma Shri Pt  , who performed at a musical gala in the city on Wednesday.

 "Youth today consider the number of performances as the only unit to measure success and it's wrong as it cannot be a yardstick to measure progress," he said, calling fame and the number of performances illusionary.
 
 A musician should work with a balanced mindset and not run after temporary fame, an artiste should perform for the love of music, he said.
 
 Santoor has been there for nearly six decades as compared to the other classical instruments, but, the number of santoor players isn't as high as that of the other instruments, said Vyas.
 
 Though Indian youths are inclined towards other instruments, there is an increase in the number of Westerners, who are learning santoor and are passionate about it, he added.
 
 "During my time, very few people would choose music as a profession. Nowadays, I find many youngsters, who make their career out of music," said Vyas, who started the concert with raag Bhopali.
 
 "Hindustani music is based on timing and thankfully it will be the perfect timing for this taal," he said. Vyas also expressed the desire to play in the Tansen Samaroh.
