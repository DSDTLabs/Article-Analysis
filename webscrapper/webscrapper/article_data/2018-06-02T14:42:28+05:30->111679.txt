SURAT: Even after five months of the Mumbai’s Goods and Service Tax ( ) and the central excise department’s crackdown on angadias and seizure of huge quantity of parcels containing gold and diamonds, about 70 parcels belonging to the diamond and jewellery firm owners from Surat, Mumbai, Bhavnagar and Ahmedabad are yet to be released. 

 
 The firm owners have made a strong representation to the gems and   (GJEPC) for ensuring that their parcels seized by GST and central excise department during the crackdown on January 1, 2018, be released at the earliest. 
 
 About 125 parcels containing diamonds, gold and jewellery worth crores of rupees were seized from 80 couriers of various angadia firms at the   railway station during the crackdown by GST and central excise officials on January 1 on the suspicion of the tax evasion under GST.
 
 The investigation revealed that some of the parcels were genuine as the applicable duties and tax were paid, while majority of them were found without invoice. While the genuine parcels were released, the department has seized majority of the parcels on which duties are not paid. 
 
 The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) had represented the issue to the finance minister and the concerned authorities and received assurance that the genuine parcels seized by the department will be released, while those without paper work will be seized. 
 
 It must be remembered that GST on jewellery, silver and polished diamonds is 3 per cent, while the rough diamonds are taxed at 0.25 per cent. 
 
 Talking to TOI, regional chairman of   said, “We are in continuous touch with the GST department for the early release of the parcels. Many of the parties have submitted requisite documents to the department, but still the parcels are not released. There are some who have received gold in half quantity, while the rest is still lying with the department.”
