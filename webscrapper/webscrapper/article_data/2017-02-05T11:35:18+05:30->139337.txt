PATNA: A   bench of Acting Chief Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice Sudhir Singh on Saturday upheld the state government’s decision to include Teli and   on the list of   (EBC).
 
  Advocate Brajesh Kumar, who appeared before the bench on behalf of Bihar Tailik Sahu Samaj, said the court passed the order while acting on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by one Kishori Das, who had opposed the government’s decision saying it was politically motivated.
  
  The Bihar government had issued a notification on April 24, 2015, including Teli and Tamoli castes on EBC list in order to provide people from these two castes reservation benefits. The EBC category enjoys 18% reservation in the state.
  
  “It was argued in the court that the government’s decision was based on the recommendations of the state commission for backward classes, which had made an exhaustive and independent study,” Kumar said, adding that a Supreme Court order of 1993 in Indira Sawhney case had resulted in formation of such statutory body in every state for study of status of all castes. He said there are around 20 lakh Telis in the state.
  
  Senior advocate   appeared for Kishori Das while Y V Giri, Kumar and Manoj Gupta appeared for Bihar Tailik Sahu Samaj. Anjani Kumar appeared for state government and the commission for backward classes.
