BATHINDA: Punjab Police’s bureau of investigations (BOI) assistant inspector general on Friday visited   to inquire into a complaint of sexual harassment by a woman teacher against a deputy superintendent of police (DSP). The woman had complained against   Harinder Singh Mann, posted with the special task force (STF), in April 2017. 

 A case of sexual harassment was registered against DSP Mann on April 5, 2017. However, Bathinda police had filed a cancellation report in the court, which was rejected and reinvestigation ordered. A special investigation team (SIT) formed to look into the matter is still to submit its report.
 
 Meanwhile, the complainant approached the BOI to get the matter probed by a woman IPS officer. BOI’s AIG (commission)   inquired into the matter but declined to comment on the case.
 
 The woman had lodged a police complaint after a tiff with her in-laws. The matter was probed by DSP Mann and the complainant had accused him of sexual harassment when she met him regarding her complaint. The woman said she had no faith in Bathinda police as the DSP was influential and could tamper with the probe report. She wanted investigations by a woman IPS officer.
 
 When contacted, Bathinda senior superintendent of police ( ) Naveen Singla said the court had ordered reinvestigation and a SIT was set up under SP (investigations) Swarn Singh. “Meanwhile, she (complainant) approached BOI for another probe. Bureau’s AIG on Friday recorded statement of the DSP, the complainant and some witnesses,” said Singla.
