SRINAGAR: Kashmiri youth claiming to be followers of “deposed” Hizbul Mujahideen chief   told people on Wednesday that they stood for the Islamic State terror outfit and forbade them from draping the bodies of three terrorists killed in encounters in Pakistani flags. The three Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists were gunned down by security forces in Radbugh village of central Kashmir’s Budgam district on Tuesday night. 

 These armed youth also prohibited the crowds from shouting pro-azadi and pro-Pakistan slogans; significantly, the people complied with their directives while coming out in large numbers for the burials.  , a photo journalist covering the funeral of slain   in downtown Srinagar, said the youth proclaimed that they subscribed to the views of Zakir Musa, who preaches Caliphate (or Islamist rule), and whose video last month threatening Hurriyat separatists with death sent shock waves across the Valley. 
 
 All the three terrorists were from central Kashmir. While Sajjad Ahmad Gilkar was from Malarata in downtown Srinagar, Javid Sheikh, was from Beerwah Churpora and Aaquib Gul from Goripura in Rawalpora. Gul had gone underground just 15 days ago to join Hizb, police said. 
 
 Based on specific intelligence inputs about the presence of militants, security forces earlier cordoned Radbugh village on Tuesday evening. All the three terrorists hiding in the house were killed “outside the house after they came out and tried to break the cordon”, police said. The operation was conducted by the Army and SOG of Jammu & Kashmir Police without causing any collateral damage. 
 
 Police said no civilians came out to help the militants to escape from the area. However, authorities on Wednesday imposed restrictions in several parts of the old city to prevent protests.
