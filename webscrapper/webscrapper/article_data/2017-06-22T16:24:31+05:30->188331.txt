  Mister is an upcoming Telugu film directed by Srinu Vaitla. It features Varun Tej, Lavanya Tripathi and Hebah Patel in the lead roles. Production began in February 2016. Principal photography commenced in May 2016 in Hyderabad.
 
 
  Mister is the story of a happy-go-lucky guy who falls for a girl and is loved by another one. The tale of triangular love story embedded with family emotions and a dose of director marked comedy.
 
 
 : Varun Tej has tried a new role and tried hard to work comedy and kind of leaves the viewers impatient. With intense chasing and run-over-the mill comedy, Mister only comes out as a regular commercial fare until now.Both Lavanya and Hebah have nothing to do much. 
 ...
 
 
  While the director loaded the first half of the film with punch dialogues, comedy tracks and romance, the second half is unbearably emotional. All the characters — from the protagonist to his grandfather and the heroines, everybody are seen sacrificing for one another, making it excessively melodramatic, until Chai settles all the confusion in the very end of the film.
