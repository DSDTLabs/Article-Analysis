The actress, often spotted with alleged beau  , will spend the day promoting her next, 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania', with buddy and co-star  , and shooting for some of her other commitments. When BT met the actress recently, and asked her if she plans to spend V-Day with someone special, she was quick to respond, “I will be shooting and promoting my film.”
