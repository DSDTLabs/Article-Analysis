AHMEDABAD: Chief minister   assured the state assembly and leader of opposition that the government was in no mood to spare anyone over the Naliya sex scandal, even if he was associated with the BJP.

 On Tuesday, as the house assembled, Congress MLA   while asking a question about Vibrant   raised the Naliya sex scandal issue and this led to an uproar in the assembly. BJP and Congress leaders got into arguments and used words like ‘thieves’ and ‘rapists’. The assembly was then adjourned for an hour.
 
 Later, leader of opposition   again demanded an assurance of a probe by a sitting judge. Chief minister Vijay Rupani said that the government is already inquiring into the incident and is in no mood to spare anyone, irrespective of leanings with the ruling BJP.
 
 The CM said this was a gruesome act and no one would be spared. He later assured   they would sit together and work out a solution in the interest of the state. Vaghela also said he was willing to request the chief justice to assign a judge to probe the scandal.
