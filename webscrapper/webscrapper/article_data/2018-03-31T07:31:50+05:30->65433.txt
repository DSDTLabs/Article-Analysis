PANAJI: Of the total number of patients on dialysis at the   (GMC) and hospital, roughly only 31% comprise women, even though they are at a higher risk of developing chronic disease. 

 Head of nephrology department GMC Dr J P   said that though the risk factor for developing chronic   diseases is higher for women, “the tendency among women is to ignore the illness lest they burden other members of the family”, which is why they suffer in silence. “Even when they are put on dialysis, at times, it is late,” Tiwari said.
 
 Of the about 160-odd patients on dialysis at GMC, Tiwari said, about 50 are women. 
 
 The trend was similar in the case of kidney transplants, too. Of the 16 kidney transplant cases at the premier hospital, Tiwari said in only three cases the recipients have been women.
 
 In one case, the father donated his kidney and in two other cases the donors were husbands, said Tiwari. 
 
 “There is reluctance at the family level itself. This is also true of other illnesses when it comes to women,” Tiwari said, indicating a need for societal change. 
 
 Explaining the possible reason for the increased incidence of chronic kidney diseases among women, Tiwari said this may be because some kidney diseases, such as lupus nephritis and kidney infection, typically affects women. 
 
 Plus, there is an increased risk of kidney infection during pregnancy with pregnancy-related complication increasing the risk. 
 
 “For instance, pre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality,” Tiwari said, adding that there was a need for increased awareness about the disease to facilitate timely diagnosis and planning of therapeutic interventions.
 
 Diabetes and high blood pressure are key risk factors for developing chronic kidney disease, hence, all patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension are screened for chronic kidney disease, he added.
