JAIPUR: The   ( ) has decided to replace many existing   with new ones due to it’s heavy maintenance and poor performance. 

 The corporation has identified nearly 40 buses which will be taken off from the fleet. “For the passengers convenience, we have decided to replace 40 buses that are in bad shape and require heavy maintenance. In the existing fleet of 400 low-floor buses, annual maintenance of these identified buses is nearly Rs 6 lakh, which is relatively very high,” said a JCTSL official. 
 
 The new buses will have a front engine and will create less pollution than the existing ones. The JCTSL has already ordered to purchase and fleet of 100 new buses is expected to hit the road in next two months.
 
 Sources in the department said, “As per the rules, for the replacement of a bus, it is necessary to complete eight years or 6 lakh kilometres, whichever condition is met first. However, in this scenario, none of the condition is fulfilled as buses purchased earlier proved to be inferior,” he said. 
 
 Since the JCTSL has purchased these buses it is heavy losses on operating and maintaining the fleet. “At present, only half of the buses low-floor buses fleet plying on Jaipur roads are in perfect condition. As these buses require heavy maintenance cost and mileage of these buses is very low there was always shortage of funds. This is the reason condition of buses had gone bad to worse,” added source. 
 
 Another reason for the poor condition of buses is short supply of spare parts. Hence small faults become bigger problems. "These buses need a lot of maintenance. On an average, 10 buses come daily to the workshop for repair work. Due to lack of care, the tyres with a self-life of two years get worn out in just two months,” an RSRTC employee said.
