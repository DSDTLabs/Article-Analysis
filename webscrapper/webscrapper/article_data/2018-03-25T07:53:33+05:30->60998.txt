"Sabse mast audience hai yahan, dil khush ho gaya,” said   as he performed at  ’s annual fest,  , recently. Contrary to the general notion of fests starting late because of the singers’ late arrivals, Benny began his performance right on time, even when the entry was still on. The singer sang quite a lot of songs before saying goodbye to the “best crowd ever.”

 Although it was still daylight when Benny started performing, he still made sure that the crowd enjoyed the performance. “Delhi, aap sab ready hain party karne ke liye?” asked the singer before belting out tracks like  , Tu Hi Toh Meri Dost Hain and many more. The crowd cheered him on as he mixed Badtameez Dil with Psy’s Gangnam Style and started dancing. “I love you, SRCC. Sabse mast audience hai yahan sahi mein, dil khush ho gaya. Before I sing my next song, contract sign karo ki this place will be on fire when we dance together on this song,” he said before singing Let’s Nacho.
 “SRCC, mujhe aapko bas ek hi baat kehni hai, gaane ke through keh dun?” asked Benny, after which he sang Lat Lag Gayee.

 While the singer danced and interacted with the crowd, the students made sure that they responded as well. Komal Kashyap, a recent graduate of SRCC who was present at the fest, said, "The performance made us nostalgic. We started thinking about our days in SRCC. The way he interacted and danced with the crowd was the best."
 Swati Chawla, a second-year student of Hans Raj College, added, "It took me an hour to just get an entry. Dhakke toh padhe, but we enjoyed a lot. He sang all the songs like Lat Lag Gayee, but what I really enjoyed was when he sang Shape Of You and danced on Gangnam Style."
