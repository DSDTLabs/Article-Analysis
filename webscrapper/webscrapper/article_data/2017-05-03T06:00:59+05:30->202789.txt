LUCKNOW: Welcoming Yogi government’s decision to celebrate July 24 as  , Governor   said that he was pleased that his suggestion was finally accepted. 

 Speaking at the conclusion of two-day   celebrations at Raj Bhawan on Tuesday, Naik said every state celebrates its foundation day but that had not been the practice in UP. The governor said he had suggested to former CM   to mark a day for UP Diwas but his suggestion was ignored. 
 
 Naik, who hails from Maharashtra, had organized Maharashtra Diwas celebrations at Raj Bhawan. Chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi was the special guest. Speakers of UP and Gujarat assemblies, Hridaya Narain Dixit and Raman Lal Vora, respectively, also attended it .
 
 The governor said UP and Maharashtra share a strong bond and added that several people from the two states have contributed in their development. “Freedom fighter Balgangdhar Tilak had given the slogan “Freedom is my birth right” from Lucknow only. Actor Amitabh Bachchan hails from Uttar Pradesh, but his work place is Mumbai,” Naik said.
 
 Speaking at the function, CM said it’s sad that the singing of Vande Matram is seen as a communal act. Yogi also spoke some lines in Marathi in his speech and even raised the slogan “Jai Maharashtra”. He lauded Naik’s efforts in starting MPLAD funds for the MPs and singing of Vande Matram in Parliament
