NAGPUR: The local education department will start sale of forms for   admissions from May 2. The Centralized Admission Procedure (CAP) is applicable for all junior college seats within city limits. Students who appeared for Std X board exams this summer can purchase the forms directly from their school and even submit it online from there. 

 The entire admission process is now online but the instruction manual has to be purchased online. The manual also comes with a unique number which stays with the student during the entire online admission process. It is mandatory for all students to register online, regardless of the quota (managements, in-house, minority etc) they are claiming admission under.
