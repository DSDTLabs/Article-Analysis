Evil magician Augor falls into his trap and gets angry. He agrees to put the gem aside. But his wife warns him that Gopal is trying to distract his concentration. Augor supports his wife and tells that he won’t give the gem in his (Gopal’s) hands. Gopal asks him to put it in a box, kept on the table. He agrees and puts it inside the box. Previously Gopal had asked the giant to turn himself into the box but Augor is unaware of the fact. Incidentally the evil magician keeps the gem inside the box (actually the giant in the disguise of a box). The moment Augor keeps the gem inside, it comes into Gopal’s hands. Augor gets furious to see this. He warns that he would kill Parbati. Gopal says that he can’t cause any harm to her as the gem is in his possession. Augor pleads him to give the gem back. But Gopal says that the gem would only bring greed. He decides to destroy it. Augor keeps pleading him. Augor’s wife too understands what Gopal explained. She tries to stop Augor. But he pushes her aside. She accidentally falls on a sharp weapon and dies. Gopal runs away with the gem but Augor follows him. Gopal throws it into a pond and Augor jumps.
