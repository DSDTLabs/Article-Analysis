KOCHI: The people's representatives and Kochi corporation authorities will meet chief minister to explain difficulties the local body would be facing in case a government order (GO) instructing the corporation to agree to PWD's road restoration charges for granting road cutting sanction to   ( ).

  Almost all who attended the all-party meeting convened by the mayor said that the PWD rate is too low and insufficient funds will make the repair of city roads impossible.
 
 “The rate fixed by the PWD is very low. This wouldn't be enough for relaying roads. Even if the rate fixed by the corporation is charged from IOAGPL, restoration of roads would not be easier.
 
  Once a road is dug up, we will have to relay the entire road. Otherwise, the road will get damaged immediately, “ said Hibi Eden, MLA, who attended the meeting.
 
 The city gas project is a major one, and the local body should give all the support for the project. Meanwhile, the corporation sho uld get adequate funds for restoring the roads.
 
 “A couple of years ago, KSEB had dug up roads like George Eden Road and   for laying underground (UG) cables. Though the corporation had charged the rates fixed by the local body itself and restored the road, the road soon got damaged as only dug up portions were repaired. 
 
 One of the former councillors later moved the court and got verdict that the road should be relayed immediately. Then, the corporation had to use its own funds for relaying the entire roads, “ said the MLA.
 
 A total 890-km of roads in the city will have to be dug up for the project.
 
 K V Thomas, MP; mayor Soumini Jain; deputy mayor T J Vinod; former MLA Dominic Presentation; standing committee chairpersons; representatives all major political parties, except CPM, attended the meeting.
