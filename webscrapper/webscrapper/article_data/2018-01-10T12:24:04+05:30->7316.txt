PUNE: In less than 24 hours of 17 parked vehicles being vandalized in Thergaon and Pimpri on Monday morning, a group of young men damaged six more cars and robbed an elderly person of Rs 2,500 in Mohannagar, Pimpri, late in the night.

 The Pimpri police swung into action and arrested four youths. The police have registered an offence of dacoity against the suspects. “Six of their accomplices are on the run. A manhunt has been launched for them,” said Vivek Mugalikar, the senior inspector. He added, “The incident was a fallout of rivalry between two groups.”
 
 Around 10.30 pm on Monday, a gang of 10 suspects, armed with sharp weapons and rods, entered the   colony in Mohannagar. They smashed the windscreens of the parked cars and also pelted stones at the windowpanes of houses in the colony.
 
 When 60-year-old Annasaheb Shirsat tried to stop them, the suspects threatened him with sharp weapons and robbed him of Rs 2,500, said an officer of the Pimpri police.
 
 Fear gripped the residents of the colony as the suspects were in the neighbourhood for almost half-an-hour.
 
 “Our team rushed to Ramnagar and arrested two of the suspects,” Mugalikar said. Two others were arrested on Tuesday. “The suspects have murder and robbery cases against them from the time they were minors,” Mugalikar said.
 
 Satish Patil, the assistant commissioner of police (Pimpri division), told TOI that police patrolling in the areas have been intensified to avert such incidents in the future. “We have arrested the suspects under stringent Sections of the Indian Penal Code,” Patil added.
