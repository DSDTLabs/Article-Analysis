AMRITSAR: Ignoring its volunteers again,   Aadmi Party picked yet another former Congress leader   to contest from   constituency on Thursday. 

 The announcement took local volunteers and founder members of party by surprise, causing further resentment. They accused the AAP central leadership of fielding candidates without consulting them “which had already brought much embarrassment to the party“.
 
 AAP had first picked up former Congress leader   but cancelled his name within 24 hours after receiving complaints against him. The party then nominated another former Congress member from Darbari Lal who, after two days, declined the AAP's ticket and rejoined his old party.
 
 AAP's district spokesperson Gurbhej Singh told TOI, “Gupta is a medical professional and can be an asset to the party , especially in setting up infrastructure for providing health services in the state.“
 
 Earlier, AAP's founder member Ashok Talwar had pitched for the party ticket from   constituency and had even approached party's high command after the announcement of ticket to Rajinder. Party withdrew Rajinder's candidature and picked up Lal.When Lal too left AAP , party chose to field Gupta, a former member of Amritsar Municipal Corporation.
 
 “We have come to know that AAP observers from outside   have developed a multilayer information system. We never knew about the names of Rajinder Kumar or Darbari Lal till he heard it through media.Similarly no local volunteer knew about Gupta,“ informed an AAP volunteer who didn't want to give his name, adding it would definitely reflect during voting.
