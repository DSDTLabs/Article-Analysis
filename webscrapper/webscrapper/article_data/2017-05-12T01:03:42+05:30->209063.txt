NAGPUR:   (YBMMS) had organized a ‘Gatha Spardha’ and chanting programme in which people belonging to all age groups competed by reciting sacred verses in Pali, extracted from the teachings of Lord Buddha. They also presented these sagas in the form of songs and dance performances at Bezon Bagh, Kamptee Road, to mark  , on Wednesday.

 Around twenty entries from across Nagpur were registered. There were solo as well as group performances in which representatives of all generations of a family teamed up to prove their mettle in a competitive spirit. Grandparents and their grandchildren created an euphoric ambience. Four-year-old youngest participant   remembered Dr BR   and narrated ‘Preamble to the Constitution of India’.
 
 This is the first such initiative in city which aims at bringing people together to keep the essence of Buddhism alive and incline the youth towards religion, said members of YBMMS.
 
 Discussing the need to conduct such an activity, member   said, “It’s been 60 years since Ambedkar guided us to embrace Buddhism but we still lack knowledge about our faith and have not implemented it in our life fully. We are shouldered with the responsibility to keep Buddhism alive in India and so we are trying to involve more youth by conducting innovative events. They will develop an interest, seek better understanding of the belief and carry it further.”
 
 “We are far behind Thailand and Burma in terms of practising Buddhism as everyone there has these gathas at the tip of their tongue,” added Sukhdeve. Ujwala Gajbhiye said that understanding the verses in Pali helps attain peace of mind and spreads positive vibes. These philosophies of Buddha lift up the spirit and rejuvenate the soul. She added, “Concentration levels increase and kids who have already resorted to it will experience long-term benefits.”
