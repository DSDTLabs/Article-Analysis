PUNE: The   fire in Mumbai, which claimed 14 lives last month, has prompted the   to conduct a fire safety audit at   in the coming weeks.

 Expressing concern over the lack of safety measures at the facility, PCB CEO DN   tabled a proposal of fire safety audit in the general body on Wednesday. “During our survey carried out at Fashion Street, we found that the facility doesn’t have adequate safety measures. It may jeopardise safety of visitors,” Yadav told TOI on Saturday.
 
 Yadav said apart from being congested, many vendors have occupied the premises illegally. “The most worrisome factor is that they have taken electricity connections illegally. It is very risky and we have directed our officials act against the violators,” he added.
 
 Board sources said the a safety audit of the facility was carried out in the past and the same was discussed in the general body meeting as well. “Despite knowing the fact, the board has not taken any action. Thousands of people visit Fashion Street every day and, therefore, having a proper safety measure in place is the need of the hour,” said a senior board official. The official further said in the event of fire or stampede, it would be difficult to carry out rescue operations due to the congested roads.
 
 “Brigadier  , PCB president, during the meeting, directed the board’s fire department to take prompt action, carry out inspection and submit a report, and send legal notices to violators,” the official added.
