Indian television may be dominated by women, but   has managed to make a name for himself in the medium, after playing title roles in shows over the years. But fiction apart, the actor, unlike his colleagues, has never participated in any reality show so far. In a quick chat with BT, he tells us why...

 
 
 I have been associated with reality shows, but as an anchor and not as a contestant. I think that’s primarily because enacting different characters on screen is my forte and that’s what I’m most comfortable with. However, one should never say never.
 
 
 
 I have chosen this path for myself and luckily, it has worked for me. There’s hardly any male actor on TV who has got the opportunity to play title roles consecutively. But having said that, it does put a little extra pressure as the choices that come your way are limited, considering that TV is a women-oriented medium.
 
 
 
 Whether or not the show revolves around you, one still checks the ratings because ultimately, it’s the numbers that count. It’s like an exam, the result of which comes out every week (smiles).
 
 
 
 Yes, it was. My upcoming film is a suspense thriller. As an actor, I choose my work on the basis of the storyline, script and what my character has to offer.
 
 
 
 I consider myself my own competition. I am a pure vegetarian and I don’t believe in shortcuts in life. I have never taken steroids and I advise my friends and colleagues to avoid it and keep it natural. My mantra is to work hard and be patient. There are times when you can be lax, but I do not let that sink in. Something within me tells me, ‘You cannot give in’. I then look at my older pictures and get motivated again. Living up to my own standard keeps me going!
