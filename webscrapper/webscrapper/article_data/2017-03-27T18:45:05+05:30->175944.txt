 In the original Hollywood film, Chef Carl Casper (played by filmmaker-actor Jon Favreau), starts a food truck after losing his restaurant job following a showdown with a formidable food critic and a disagreement with the restaurant's owner. Raja told Mirror, "We have portrayed a unique side of New York, shot in places where our films rarely go to. We were hit by a snowstorm and the temperature dipped to below zero. It was really sporting of Saif and my crew to shoot in such extreme conditions so that we could use it to our advantage and create the exact mood I had envisaged for this section of the film."
