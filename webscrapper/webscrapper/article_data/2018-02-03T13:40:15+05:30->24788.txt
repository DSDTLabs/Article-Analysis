NEW DELHI: Ahead of this year's school   comes a self-help book that could guide students on how to cope with stress, and it's written by none other than Prime Minister  , who arguably has the most stressful job in the country.

 
 Students needn't worry though about getting yet another lecture on burning the midnight oil. The publishers promise the book is "non-preachy, practical and thought-provoking". 
 
 The book, ' ', by newbie author Narendra Modi, releases today. It's currently in English, but will be published in multiple languages, according to a PTI report from last July.
 
  
  
 
 The idea for the book is believed to have come from Modi himself, said the PTI report. He apparently decided to write the book after perceiving a good response to his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' addresses.
 
 It was in a 'Mann ki Baat' that the PM addressed the country's 'Exam Warriors', first in 2015, and then again in 2016 and 2017.
 
 "'Exam Warriors' is a handy guide for students in India and across the world. The book seeks to add to the debate and discourse around the importance of stress-free examinations and the need to pursue knowledge over marks," said the publisher in a statement.
 
 The book is said to be interactive, with illustrations, activities and yoga exercises, and "intended to be a friend to youths not only in acing exams but also in facing life".
  
  
  
 " A series of asanas and breathing exercises are also included for students to overcome stress," said Penguin.
 
 Best of all, the PM also has suggestions in his book on what to after the stressful exams are over.
 
 "We are delighted to publish Prime Minister Modi to take his message to the youth of our country. With his vision for ensuring their success he has put India on a path of change and we at   India are excited to be working together to bring his thoughts to the nation and beyond," said the publisher last July.
