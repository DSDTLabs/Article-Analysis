MUMBAI: The centralized online admission process for   has on offer over 1.05 lakh seats for round three, which began on Wednesday. The online admission portal will continue to accept fresh applications and changes up to 5pm today. While, about 98,000 students are yet to get admission, there are around 37,000 students who have yet not been allotted a seat in the previous rounds. 

 “These students might have selected colleges where cut-offs and their marks do not match. Such students are left out of the system. The students, in round three, must be careful while selecting colleges. They must refer to vacancies and cut-offs while making a choice,” said  , deputy director of education, Mumbai.
 
 The education department put up a list of vacant seats in every college on Tuesday night. There are about 1.05 lakh seats vacant out of the total 2.92 lakh. While number of seats available outnumber vacancies, popular colleges might not have much to offer. 
 
 “There are a few seats vacant in the reserved categories but they will be moved to the open category only in the fourth and final round of admission. So, we cannot expect any percentage drop in cut-offs in the third round,” said  , vice principal, VG Vaze College, Mulund. “Since most of our seats are full, we will start the academic year on August 4 itself,” he added.
 
 Parents and students continued to complain about the online process. “The portal opened only at 1pm. That means students will get only one and a half day to make changes. The department deactivates the link at 5pm but doesn’t start it on time,” said  , a parent.
