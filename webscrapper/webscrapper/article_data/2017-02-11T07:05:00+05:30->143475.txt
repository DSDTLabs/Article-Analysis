PATIALA: Being targeted for Punjabi University’s financial crisis, re-employed teachers here on Thursday termed it as uncalled for. They claimed that just a pittance was being spent on their salaries.

 At present there are around 70 such teachers and other staffers in the university. They had faced heat when in September 2016 the   government had asked the university authorities not to re-appoint teachers who had retired to revive its fiscal health. With the state government holding back the second instalment of Rs 50 crore grant promised by chief minister  , the university mooted a plan to recruit new teachers on lower salaries.
 
 Prof  , convener of the re-employed teachers’ body, said the salaries of re-employed teachers did not exceed Rs 5 crore per year. He said the university would continue to face a serious financial crisis even in case their services were discontinued as it would have to pay around Rs 20 crore as retirement benefits. “Moreover, the interest that the university was accruing from this amount compensates for a large part of the salaries, other than monthly pension, that is being paid to the re-employed teachers,” he maintained.
 
 Jaswinder said more than 700 PhD and MPhil students were being guiding by the teaching staff in addition to the research fellows. Besides, several multi-crore projects were also being handled by them. “In case of their retrenchment, these students will be left in the middle of nowhere and the research work will be adversely affected,” he added.
 
 “There had been little or no recruitment of teachers during the 1980s and most of the senior faculty of the university comprises of re-employed senior faculty. In case their services are discontinued, the university will face dearth of talent of the senior and experienced faculty, which will affect the ongoing teaching and research activities,” he claimed.
