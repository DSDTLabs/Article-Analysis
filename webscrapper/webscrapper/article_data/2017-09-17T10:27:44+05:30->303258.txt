LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has stayed the arrest of an accused in the case of the murder of businessman Mukesh Manwani.

 Manwani (36) was shot by five persons at his shop in   on August 25. Six people were named in the FIR. While five of them have been arrested, one is absconding. Saturday's order stayed arrest of   alias   , whose name came up later in the case. 
 
 The court said Monty will not be arrested till there was substantial   or till submission of a police report under section 173 (2), whichever was earlier, provided he cooperated with the investigation. Monty sought a stay on his arrest because there was no prima facie evidence against him and pleaded he was not named in the FIR.
