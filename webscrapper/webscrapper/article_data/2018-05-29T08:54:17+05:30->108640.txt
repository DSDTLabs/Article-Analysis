CHENNAI: TN chief sthapathi Muthiah has approached the Madras high court seeking anticipatory   apprehending arrest in a criminal case registered by the idol wing police in connection with alleged irregularities in   Murugan temple Vimanam (tower)   topping work.

 According to the petitioner, he reliably believed that the idol wing police has included him in the alleged complaints of irregularities in the gold dipping work of Moolavar Vimanam of Tiruttani Subramania Swamyâ€™s temple.
 
  The petitioner said that the letter dated November 7, 1990 by the then commissioner of HR&CE preceded by a government order dated September 17, 1990 would show that casting of metal idol or carrying out any work with the metal, be it gold or silver, was not assigned to him.
