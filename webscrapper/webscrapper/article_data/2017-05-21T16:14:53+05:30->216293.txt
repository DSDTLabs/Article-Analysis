If rumours were numbers, the gossip coming out of   would have surpassed the box office collections of the two Baahubalis. Providing fodder this week was the   Ganguly-Raj Chakrabarty-Mimi Chakraborty trio. While I am sure something must have gone terribly wrong in the lovers' paradise of   and Subhashree, rumours of a double suicide attempt by the two women are quite unbelievable. Things got blown out of proportion by their so-called friends and well-wishers.From whatever I have seen of Mimi, she was struggling to get over the director until recently and would often talk about him with fondness.They turned heads when they came together for a recent event. I don't know if, after this controversy, Raj and Subhashree will still walk down the aisle or if they've kissed and made up, but what I'm certain of is the courage of the two women, who are holding their own despite the changing dynamics of their love lives. So when Mimi was asked by   to share the screen with Subhashree for a few minutes in Amar Aponjon -a casting coup that remains a secret -she didn't blink an eye.Thorough professionals, they kept to themselves on the sets and gave their best every time the camera rolled. The unit members tell me they even broke into peals of laughter for the perfect shot. Behind every strong woman, I tell you, is a story of courage.
