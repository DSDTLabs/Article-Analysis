RAJKOT: The number of   captured by the   ( ) on Saturday night has gone up to 94. 

 The fishermen’s body in Porbandar confirmed that four more boats with 24 fishermen on board were taken away by PMSA on Tuesday night from near the International Maritime Boundary off Jakhau coast. Earlier, they had received a confirmation that 70 fishermen with 15 boats had been abducted by PMSA.
 
 Of the captured boats, eight are from Porbandar and four from Okha, said Bharat Modi, president of Porbandar Macchimar Boat Association. 
 
 “The numbers could increase and we are awaiting confirmation from the Pakistan security agency,” Modi said. 
 
 This is the highest number of fishermen from Gujarat captured by the PMSA at one go. Earlier, on February 19 last year, 88 fishermen were arrested by PMSA from near the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) along with their 16 boats.
 
 Meanwhile, Modi has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help expedite the release of nearly 100 fishing boats which Pakistan had agreed to do in June last year. The fishermen’s body said that these boats would be rendered useless for fishing once the monsoon this year ends and it would cause immense financial loss to the fishermen. 
 
 “The release of these 22 boats has been stuck up in government procedures since a long time. We had even received a letter stating that the external affairs ministry and the state fisheries department are making hectic efforts for their release. The boats were then scheduled to be released on September 2,” Modi said in a letter sent before a fortnight, adding, “Later, we received information that other 77 boats would be released by Pakistan.” 
 
 According to him, there are 925 fishing boats lying seized in Pakistan and they are valued at Rs 460 crore. Of these, nearly 400 are still in good condition and conducive for fishing. However, if there is further delay, these boats could be rendered useless.
