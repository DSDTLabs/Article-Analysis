Chandigarh: After targeting the commercial and residential areas of the city, the property   collection department of the municipal corporation (MC) has now sent notices to half a dozen government and private schools of the city. Giving them one month’s time, the authorities concerned warned them of a strict action, which may lead to the sealing of properties.

 What is more interesting is the fact that the authorities have sent the notices to these schools because they have failed to pay their dues since their inspection.
 
 “We have sent notices to some schools, including DAV Sector 8, which has to deposit around Rs 40 lakh. Besides this, there are other schools too. We have prepared a list of other buildings and those which are liable to pay the tax, the notices would be sent to them in a few days,” said a senior official of the MC.
 
 Similarly, the MC officials had recently sent notices to various commercial buildings and sealed one commercial building in sector 7 on Tuesday for not paying tax. Besides this, the authority also sent the notices to the officers of the Congress and BJP of Punjab and Chandigarh region for not paying the tax and also to the companies working in the IT Park of the city.
