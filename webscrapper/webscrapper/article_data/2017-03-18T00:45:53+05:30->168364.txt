Gurgaon: In a bid to stop   e-rickshaws in the city, the Regional Transport Authority ( ) has started a drive to seize unauthorised vehicles. 

 It was found that most e-rickshaws in   are not registered with the transport department, neither they do have proper documents. Many   drivers were also found to be without a valid   or verification.
 
 The RTA impounded 17 such e-rickshaws on Friday which have been kept at Sector 29 and Sector 18 police stations. According to the RTA, the owners will have to present required documents and get their vehicle registered with the RTA to get their vehicle released.
 
 “Any person with a valid commercial licence for light vehicle can drive these battery operated cycle-rickshaws. But the vehicle has to be mandatorily be registered with the authority which they have not been doing and this is illegal,” said Trilok Chand, secretary RTA.
 
 E-rickshaws were launched in Gurgaon in February 2016. The idea was to boost short-distance connectivity at an affordable price. Since then over a thousand e-rickshaws are plying in Gurgaon. However, only 300 of these have been registered with the RTA. Out of these, only 76 have been issued permits to ferry passengers. But this order by the RTA in Gurgaon contradicts a notification issued by the transport ministry earlier this week which said e-rickshaws no more required permits to ply on roads. However the notification also stated that state governments were free to impose restrictions under appropriate traffic laws on plying of e-rickshaws.
 
 An e-rickshaw costs around Rs 60,000 to 65,000 each, however, this costs almost doubles up if it is registered. The sales taxes, excise duty, registration fee, etc costs another Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000.
