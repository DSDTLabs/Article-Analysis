MUMBAI: The Sena daily, Saamna, has advised the   government to get out of "election mode" and address the law-and-order issues in Maharashtra. 

 The newspaper on Thursday blamed forces outside the state for fomenting trouble in Maharashtra. Pointing out that the   was proof of the failure of state intelligence and the police, Saamna said, "The state government should have known that several people who want to spread disharmony are triggering riots ...They have been functioning from behind the curtain ...Those who are envious of Maharashtra's progress are out to create trouble."
 
 However, the   mouthpiece refrained from commenting on the details of the Dalit-right-wing conflict or the demand of Bharipa-Bahujan Mahasangh chief Prakash Ambedkar that right-wing activists Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote should be arrested and tried under IPC Section 302. 
 
 Bhide reportedly has excellent equations with Sena president  . The Sena watchers point out that Thackeray is yet to comment on the Koregaon Bhima clash. The newspaper sated that the impasse that the Fadnavis regime faces is because it has only been thinking of winning polls and of consolidating its rule with the help of police. The newspaper also urged and caste-based groups to throw off the yoke of history. It also urged Ambedkar not to foment trouble for political gains.
