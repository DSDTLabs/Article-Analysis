PUNE: The driver-cum-guard, who had fled with a vehicle carrying Rs 5 crore in cash from Sasanenagar in Hadapsar on Friday night, was nabbed in Karnataka’s   on Saturday. 

 Karnataka police have revealed that Rs4.96 crore of the stolen amount has been recovered from the suspect. However, the suspect had already spent the remaining Rs4,000 by the time he was nabbed.
 
 “The suspect, Narayan Baban Khedekar of Urali Kanchan, was apprehended by Karnataka police at the Gabburu toll plaza in Hubballi. The arrest was made on the basis of information given by the Pune police,” said Deepak Sakore, the deputy commissioner of police (Zone-IV). 
 
 Sakore said Khedekar is being questioned by Karnataka police. 
 
 “We will take him into custody soon. We will then find out the motive behind the robbery,” he said, and added, “Prima facie probe has revealed that Khedekar had acted on his own. However, we will question him once we get his custody from the Karnataka police.”
 
 Khedekar was employed as a guard-cum-driver by a private firm dealing in cash replenishment at automated teller machines (ATMs). On Friday, at around 8.15 pm, Khedekar had gone to an ATM kiosk in Sasanenagar, along with a gunman and a helper, to refill cash. “While the helper and the gunman were inside the kiosk, Khedekar fled with the van,” said Vishnu Pawar, senior inspector of Hadapsar police. At the time, the vehicle was carrying Rs5 crore — in Rs2,000, Rs500 and Rs100 notes. 
 
 “As soon as we came to know that the van had entered the neighbouring state of Karnataka, we alerted the Karnataka police,” Pawar said.
 
 K. Parashuram, the superintendent of police at Haveri in Karnataka, said that soon after the police got to know that Khedekar was passing through the Gabburu toll plaza, he was apprehended. “We took him into custody at about 4 pm on Saturday,” Parashuram said. “Rs4.96 crore was recovered from him,” the police officer said.
