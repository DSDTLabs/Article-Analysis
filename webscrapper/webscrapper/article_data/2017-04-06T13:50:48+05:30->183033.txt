NAGPUR: 15 tola   and cash amounting to Rs20,000, total worth of Rs3.22lakh, were   from a residence in Lal Imli at Tehsil on Tuesday afternoon. Miscreant sneaked into the upstairs room when the owner of the house Kamal Waswani (51) and his family were watching television on the ground floor. 

 But Tehsil   could not trace fingerprints as the family members had checked the cupboard and other things in the room before the cops could summon the fingerprints experts. The family claimed it was their maid who had left the door unlocked.
 
 Cops said Waswani owns a kitchen utensil business along with his other brothers. The entire family was in the ground floor and were watching television during lunch-time at 11:45 when their maid was doing household chores upstairs. Waswani could not recall when she finished work and left the place, added cops.
 
 “Waswani went to upper floor at around 2:45pm and saw that the rooms were unlocked. On searching further he found cupboards were open, clothes were thrown on the floor and the whole place was ransacked. Other family members, who too rushed inside, immediately started looking for missing valuables before informing us,” said API PD Kulthe. Because of it, cops lost the thief’s fingerprints, he added. The substantial material and cash, total amounting to Rs3.22lakh, is missing from the room. 
 
 No CCTV camera was installed at Waswani’s place or in the lane. Tehsil police has registered the offence of theft under section 380 of IPC.
