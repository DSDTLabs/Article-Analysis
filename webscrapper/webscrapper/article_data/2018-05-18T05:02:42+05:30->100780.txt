NEW DELHI: A woman doctor was duped twice in a week by a   placement agency. 

 
 Ritika Gandhi's maid had to go to her village. She tried looking for a replacement. Someone told her to check for such agencies  . And she did, contacting those with the highest ratings and customer reviews. 
 
  Gandhi narrowed down her search to one agency, which asked her to pay Rs 2,500 as registration fees to get a well-trained and reliable maid. "They sent an agent to my house in  , who showed me a few documents, all of which looked authentic. Thereafter, he promised me that the maid would be sent to me in two days. When there was no word even after three days, I started calling them up to check. At first my calls went unanswered and then my number was blocked," Gandhi said. 
 
 A week later, she contacted a different agency and was promised a reliable maid. "On Sunday, an agent came home with a maid. He took Rs 20,000 for her services and left her there with her bag. I took her photo too. She started working. I had to go out for work, but my in-laws were home. They assumed that she was watering plants outside, but she fled. Our guard saw her leave," Gandhi said. 
 
 When she tried to contact the agency, her number was blocked again. Police suspect a bigger racket is operating.
