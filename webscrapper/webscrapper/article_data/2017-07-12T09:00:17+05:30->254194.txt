To integrate the element of health with women and child welfare, Yogi government has decided to put specific days on the state calendar.
The fifth day of every month will be dedicated to children while 15th would be earmarked for adolescent girls. The two days would be called Bachpan Divas and Laadli Divas, respectively. Besides, 25th day of every month, Mamta Divas, will be dedicated to women.
 
 “The special days would be to give health and welfare messages. For instance, bachpan diwas will be integrated with activities under bal swastha suraksha karyakram or sarva shiksha abhiyan,“ said an officer in the state women and child department. Similarly, on Mamta Divas the message of maternal health will be spread. “Activities like Saas Bahu Sammelans can be organised on these day to create awareness about health of women of all age groups,“ said an officer in state health department. Likewise, Laadli Divas will be used to campaign against anaemia which affects over 80% adolescent girls in the state. “The specific days will be an occasion to initiate a dialogue through gatherings would help in achieving behavioural change,“ said health activist Bobby Ramakant.
 
 The days would serve purpose through Mahila Evam Bal Vikas Adhikar Manch being set up at block level and would be used also for extending information on a number of social issues like domestic violence and welfare schemes.
 
 “Inter-departmental coordination is always a challenge for most of us. The special days will aid convergence between health, family welfare, women welfare, police and other departments,“ said a senior officer in chief minister's office.
