Panaji: Even as the rest of the country reeled under a heat wave, the state has been experiencing normal weather, as the early setting in of the sea breeze has so far restricted the impact of the heat to a more bearable level.

 The mercury has remained normal with minimum and maximum temperatures being in the range of 25 to 26°C and over 33°C, respectively, during the first week of April as the summer progresses into its peak phase. “This is because when the temperature starts rising, the sea breeze sets in,” said D  , scientist, meteorological centre at Altinho.
 
 The mercury starts rising after 10 in the morning, but the cool breeze blowing towards the land keeps the heat within the normal level. In 2016, it was often witnessed that the sea breeze was absent during most parts of the day and started blowing only late in the afternoon. 
 
 “One can always expect humidity when the sea breeze is blowing, but it has not been above normal so far,” said   M   said. 
 
 The meteorological centre expects a similar trend to continue for the next few days. “There may be some cloudy weather due to a system in  ,” Sanap said.
 
 But it may become weak and the sky may be bright as usual. On Friday, the met centre recorded a maximum temperature of 33.6°C, just 0.5 degree above normal, and a minimum 26°Celsius, 0.9 degrees above normal.
