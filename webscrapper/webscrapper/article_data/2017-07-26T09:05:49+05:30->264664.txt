KANNUR: The   is reportedly upset with jail authorities for shifting the 15 accused in the   murder case to   three days ago, without informing the agency. 

 The counsel for the accused, K Viswan, said the CBI court was already informed about the difficulties faced in terms of accommodation at Ernakulam sub-jail. A plea by the accused in this regard is under consideration of the court, he said. However, CBI officials say there is a political agenda behind the decision, and it is not justified to shift the accused while the plea is still pending with the court. 
 
 "The CBI court is yet to consider the plea of the accused and without waiting for the court order and it seems odd when the accused in a sensational murder case are shifted to their home district citing difficulties," said a CBI official associated with the probe into this case. The officials said they would get a legal opinion in this connection and the future course of action would be decided accordingly.
 
 Meanwhile, the jail officials here said that it was the discretion of the jail DGP to decide where the prisoners were to be lodged. They said that the decision to shift the prisoners from Ernakulam sub-jail was taken due to the difficulty in accommodating and bringing them frequently to Kannur for hearing in other cases. They also said the decision was taken to facilitate the family of the accused to meet them.
 
 It was on September 1, 2014 that RSS leader Elamthottathil Manoj was hacked to death at   near Kathiroor in the district. All the accused arrested in this case are CPM workers and other local leaders.
