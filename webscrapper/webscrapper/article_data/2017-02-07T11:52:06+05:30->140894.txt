JAIPUR: Stung by controversies for being on the lookout for an unusually powerful aircraft, the directorate of civil aviation is all set to bring down the specifications for hiring the jet on a long-term contract. 

 Facing heat over leasing aircraft with extraordinarily high-performance parameters, the state government has lowered down the limits. Instead of 3,200 nautical miles (NM) range, the government will now invite fresh bids with a range limit of 2,600 NM. According to the sources, the service ceiling ( the altitude at which a helicopter can fly) will also be brought down from 41,000 feet. "Government has not received proposals from any private firm with the previous specifications. There will be changes and government expects that firms will now participate. Final decision on it will be taken by the empowered committee," said an official with knowhow of the developments. Other parameters like seating capacity of 10 passenger and airplane offered not to be older than 15 years will remain same. 
 
 The decision, however, has come in the wake of controversies over hiring premium mid-size aircraft for chief minister  . According to the reports, political VIPs of the state government generally don't use aircraft with high-performance parameters such as those sought by the Rajasthan government. Officials though deny those allegations and claim that lack of bids made them lowering the specification. There was nothing controversial in the tender. Most mid-size aircraft in the country are ranged near about these specifications.
 
 "Most airplanes in this category come with service ceiling of about 35,000 feet and 2,600-3,200 nautical miles. We have not asked for anything extravagant," added the official. The directorate is planning to float the tender soon as the availability of aircraft has become short because of elections.
