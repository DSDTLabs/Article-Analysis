UDHAGAMANDALAM: Plucking of   resumed on Friday after the bought leaf factories withdrew the decision to not procure green leaf from small tea growers on Friday. Since last Saturday, bought-leaf factories had stopped buying green leaf as the e-auction centres in Coonoor and Coimbatore saw meagre sales in the first two weeks of July. 

 However, as the sale of tea at auction centres increased this week by almost 90%, bought-leaf factories started buying green leaves again.
 
 According to H B Anand, president of the Nilgiris Bought-Leaf Tea Manufacturers' Association, big buyers like   and   were not taking part in the auctions as they insisted the billing through the brokers. As per Tea Act, a broker cannot own the commodity; he is a service provider for which he is paid commission.
 
 "If broker bills are entertained, there will surely be room for malpractices. Hence, in Coonoor and Coimbatore auction centers, sellers' billing is being practiced for which the buyers are not happy about," said Anand.
