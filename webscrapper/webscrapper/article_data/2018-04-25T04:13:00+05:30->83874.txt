Vadodara: The enforcement directorate’s (ED) move to attach properties of Diamond Power Infrastructure Ltd (DPIL) has left many citizens nervous.

 Northway Spaces and Mayfair Leisures, the real estate group companies of DPIL, are currently handling two big residential projects – Millennium on Vasna-Bhayli Road and The Address in Alkapuri. The Address is an upmarket residential project wherein a flat costs in crores.
 
 These residential projects are under construction but many flats have already been booked. “The CBI and ED raids at DPIL have made many of the   nervous. There is scepticism over the certainty and future of these projects among those who have booked flats. Even the construction material suppliers are jittery about their payment,” a source said.
 
 ED has attached unsold flats of these projects along with an under-construction hotel. The Bhatnagars have been planning to start 165-room Marriot Hotel on Atladara-Vadsar Road. A source in the company said that of the total 36 flats in The Address, 18 have been sold. In Millennium, 111 flats of the total 220 have been sold.
 
 “The people who have booked their flats need not worry as only unsold flats have been attached. The flats whose sale deed or agreement to sale has been done are considered sold. Under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development Act), we have to complete construction of these projects within certain time and hand over the possession. While the deadline for The Address is by the end of 2018, Millennium has to be completed by mid-2019,” a company official claimed.
 
 “Northway has stopped construction of its affordable housing project – Eklavya, and those who had booked their flats are being asked to take refund,” the official said. He added that some of the company employees are getting threat calls from material suppliers for recovering their dues. “We will get a clear picture once the top management returns to the office,” the official said.
