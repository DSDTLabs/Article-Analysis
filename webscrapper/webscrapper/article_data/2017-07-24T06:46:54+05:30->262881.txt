MANALI: A person was killed and three others feared drowned after a car plunged into the   near Vaishno Devi temple in   on Sunday afternoon.

 The car was going from Kullu to Manali when the driver lost control over the vehicle and drove it into a gorge. The car rolled down a steep slope and came to a stop only in the middle of the fast flowing waters of the Beas river, according to eyewitnesses. Workers engaged in double-laning the highway watched the accident and informed the police.
 
 The identity of the body that has been recovered is yet to be ascertained, said a policeman on the spot who did not wish to be named. “We also do not know how many people were exactly travelling in the car. Workers who were working here told us that there were four people travelling in it, but even they are not sure,” said the policeman. The car has a registration number of Kullu district.
 
 According to sources in police, a woman was also travelling in the car and there was a possibility that she had been driving it. Police have been searching along the banks of the river to find other bodies. The recovered body is that of a man. Fire services had reached the spot and the car was pulled out of the water.
