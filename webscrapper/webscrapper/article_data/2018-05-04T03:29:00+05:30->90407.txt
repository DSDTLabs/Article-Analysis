Nagpur: Maoists have put up ‘threatening’ banners and distributed pamphlets at some places in south Gadchiroli like Perimili, Jimulgatta, Jhinganoor and Tadgaon on the eve of the bandh call given by them. They have warned security forces of dire consequences in the coming days. The police too are taking no chances as they know the red guerrillas are capable of striking back. After losing 40 of their cadre in two encounters on April 22 and 23 in Kasnasur and Nainer villages, the Maoists gave a bandh call for May 4. Citing the high-handedness of the security forces, the Telangana state committee of the Maoists issued the press release through their spokesperson Jagan.  The press note claimed that several civilians, including innocent minors and villagers, were killed by the Maharashtra security forces who had claimed their biggest victory ever on the Maoists. Though it is a national call, the bandh is likely to be restricted to the ‘Dandakaranya’ areas of Telangana, entire Gadchiroli and Chhattisgarh would be mostly affected.  The cops have stepped up bandobast across the district and are confident to prevent any attacks by the Maoists. Apart from the occasional village meetings, no incidents have been reported from Gadchiroli. The rebels have threatened action even in Chhattisgarh where two security force personnels were killed. Gadchiroli SP Abhinav Deshmukh said, “We are taking all precautions to ensure the bandh is not a success. The police forces are on alert across the district.”  Deshmukh said the Maoists are appealing for people’s participation through posters and pamphlets. “No additional forces have been summoned and we will marshal our available personnel to thwart the reds,” he said. Sources from the district claimed though the Maoists have mostly failed in the district to enforce a bandh in the last few years, this time the reds may act on desperation to prove their existence.
