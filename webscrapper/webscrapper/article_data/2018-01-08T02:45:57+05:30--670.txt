NEW DELHI: He was one of the most notorious thieves on the Delhi   circuit, but his run finally ended on Friday after he was nabbed for stealing Rs 2.4 lakh from a   at Karol Bagh metro station. Amit Kumar (28), has been found involved in nine cases of theft and other criminal charges, but the tally is likely to increase, police said.

 Kumar, a native of Uttar Pradesh, started out as a waiter at his father’s roadside paratha joint in Paharganj five years ago after dropping out of school. He has studied till Class V, DCP (metro) Pankaj Kumar Singh said. His family still lives in Paharganj.
 
 Even as his family was trying hard to make ends meet, Kumar came up with the idea of making a quick buck while travelling in the metro with his friends.
 
 They entered a crowded station and stood at the gates of an incoming train. Kumar and his friend managed to steal a person’s wallet during rush hour. The easy money prompted him to commit similar thefts.
 
 Since 2013, not only had he mastered the art of stealing, but also recruited two more people to carry out the crime. The gang was found active mostly on the Violet and Blue lines. They had also committed burglaries in houses in central Delhi.
 
 Explaining the modus operandi, an investigating officer said that the three gang members would enter the station and loiter around looking for a target. They would board the train along with the target and encircle him. Kumar would then steal the victim’s bag, wallet and mobile phone and de-board the train at the next station. They would distribute the valuables equally.
 
 After getting a steady income from his thefts, Kumar got married. He now has a two-year-old son. 
 
 Cops recovered Rs 50,000 in cash from him after his arrest. He has been sent to judicial custody and a manhunt has been launched to nab his two associates.
