PANAJI: Congress state president   on Wednesday termed BJP leader   “ignorant” for his “irresponsible” statements hinting at a beef ban in Goa. Faleiro said that Goa would remain unique and that there was no reason to impose a ban.

 “I understand and I know that Subramanian Swamy is the central BJP leader. But his statement comes out of ignorance. Goa has unique culture and if they don’t understand that, they should not talk about Goa,” Faleiro said.
 
 The former chief minister pointed out that Goa already has a ban on cow slaughter which was brought in by the Congress party due to the reverence attached to the animal. “As far as the meat of buffalo and bullocks are concerned, Goa has its own legislation, we have our own meat complex and I don’t know how he can make such monstrous, irresponsible statements as far as the people of Goa are concerned,” Faleiro said.
 
 Speaking on beef ban in Goa, Swamy is reported to have said, “Goa has a tradition, we have to change that”.
