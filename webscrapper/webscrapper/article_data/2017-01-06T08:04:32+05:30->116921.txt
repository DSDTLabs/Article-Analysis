NEW DELHI: It seems the traffic police still lack a concrete plan as to how they would implement the pedestrianisation project in  , which was okayed by the Union urban development ministry on Thursday. The police had earlier proposed to turn the Middle Circle into a parking or a “halt and go” zone until there are alternative arrangements for parking of vehicles. In that case, they might turn the Outer Circle into a signal-free zone.

 Now, the traffic cops will conduct a survey and work out a plan accordingly. Senior officers said that a team had been formed to study the traffic and pedestrian volume in the area at different times of the day in order to formulate a permanent plan. “We have asked NDMC to create separate parking spaces for the vehicles coming to the existing parking slots in the Inner Circle or else arrange for alternative means of travel for people to prevent inconvenience,” said  , joint CP (traffic). Cops will also consult the market associations to come up with a plan as well.
 
 Meanwhile, traders’ associations of Connaught Place have raised major objections to the pedestrianisation project though senior NDMC officials claim that executing the plan won’t be a problem. 
 
 Atul Bhargava, president of   said the plan was not practical as it would affect the traffic movement in nearby areas, including Mandi House, Outer Circle and  .
 
 “The plan to turn CP into a no-vehicle zone is not practical at all. It will not only affect the traffic movement in nearby areas but also impact our business. People usually prefer to come by cars or take a cab but if vehicular movement is not allowed in the Inner Circle, they may not want to visit the markets. They will prefer going to malls, which will affect our livelihoods. The government should at least discuss the plan with the stakeholders before finalising it,” added Bhargava.
