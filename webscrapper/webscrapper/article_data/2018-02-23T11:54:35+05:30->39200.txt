VADODARA: The association of school parents in the city is seeing red over schools holding admit cards of class X and XII students who have not paid fees as demanded by the schools. The   (VPA) made representations to the district collector and city police commissioner in this regard and demanded that an offence should be registered against such schools.

 A memorandum submitted to the district collector states that the managements of some schools were restoring to strong arm techniques by withholding admit cards of students who have been allotted roll numbers and admit cards by their boards. The memorandum states that this act was agonising students and affecting their preparations for the exams.
 
 The memorandum also raised the issue of reports that some students in a school were made to stand on benches and were humiliated in front of the entire classroom as they had not paid fees as per the demands of the management. It adds that reports were also pouring in regarding students complaining of anxiety.
 
 The memorandum demands that criminal complaints be registered against the school authorities that were violating child rights and spoiling their future. It requests the officials to send police to record the statements of students and parents of such schools.
 
 Advocate Kishore Pillai from the association said that one of the schools that had held back admit cards had assured that these would be issued on Friday. “We are hopeful that other schools will also do the same,” he said.
