KOLKATA: The   junior team has been barred from taking part in the main round of the under-18 Youth League after the club was found guilty of fielding an overage player during the zonal phase of the tournament.

 Mohun Bagan had booked their berth in the 12-team championship round after topping the Kolkata zone. Bagan and   both finished with 23 points from 10 games with an identical goal difference (+12), but the green and maroons pipped their rivals to top place thanks to more number of goals scored.
 
 With Mohun Bagan now disqualified, East Bengal have been made group toppers and United SC - who finished third - will join them in the main round as the second team from the city zone.
 
 On being contacted, a senior Mohun Bagan official said, "I'm not aware of this development."
 
 It has been learnt that during their second match of the campaign, against   on November 22 last year, Subhankar Adhikary - who has been accused of being overage - started for Mohun Bagan, who won 1-0.
 
 Adhikary also played Mohun Bagan's opening match, against Southern Samity, five days earlier.
 
 Following an official complaint by SAI officials, the   disciplinary committee summoned Adhikary to Football House in New Delhi to appear for his medical test. But the player didn't turn up despite the AIFF sending several notices.
 
 Even Mohun Bagan were issued a showcause notice in this regard, but the club didn't reply.
 
 Following the complaint from SAI, Mohun Bagan didn't pick Adhikary in the squad in their remaining matches. But since the player and the club didn't respond, the AIFF disciplinary committee has decided to debar Mohun Bagan from any further participation in the tournament.
 
 While Adhikary has been slapped a fine of Rs 40,000 and a six-match ban from any AIFF tournament, Mohun Bagan club will have to cough up Rs 1 lakh for breach of rules.
