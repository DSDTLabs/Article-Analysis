CHENNAI: The last time Australia played an ODI series in India, it was a run fest. Both teams now understand that in order to keep the batsmen in check on these batting beauties, it's crucial to take wickets in the middle overs. With that in mind, both sides are banking on wrist spinners. While Australian captain Steve Smith said right at the beginning of the tour that leggie Adam Zampa is a certainty in the XI, India have chinaman   and leg-spinner   up their sleeve.

 The Aussies are probably more worried about Kuldeep. In order to deal with the guile of the 22-year-old, the Australian team management flew in Kerala chinaman bowler KK Jiyas for practice on Friday. The former Delhi Daredevils bowler was in action at the nets against Smith and Co so that they know what could be on offer on Sunday. "S. Sriram (Australian team consultant) called me to bowl against their batsmen. But for David Warner and   (who is injured), I bowled to all the other top batsmen and troubled a few of them. Glenn Maxwell and  , though, hit me inside out and slogged me over mid-wicket," Jiyas told TOI. Aussie left-arm spinner  , too, said that the wrist-spinners will have a "key role" to play in the series. "They don't need spinner-friendly wickets and are all pretty clever. And once the light comes on, it gets harder to pick the wrong ones. These guys are real wicket-taking options and can be hard to get away," Agar said.
 
 The Indians too, in recent times, have found out that it's good to have spinners who can dish out some unorthodox stuff. The Champions Trophy final, in which India lost to Pakistan, was a case in point, when Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin couldn't contain players who are decent players of spin. Both Kuldeep and Chahal have done pretty well in the limited chances that they have got since then and even though there's a perception that wrist-spinners can go for runs, the leggie has an economy rate of 4.14 and the chinaman 3.97 in ODIs. India vice-captain  , too, stressed on the importance of having these spinners. "I look at them as mystery spinners. You never know what's coming out of their hand. The captain is comfortable to get them into the fray as they can get crucial breakthroughs we look forward to in the middle part of the game," Rohit said.
 
 The Mumbai batsman is a very good player of spin himself but he was honest to acknowledge that he himself sometimes finds it difficult to pick these guys while batting at the nets. "Even when we are facing them in the nets, we don't know what is going to come... Chahal got an opportunity in Sri Lanka and got us a breakthroughs. Kuldeep did it the same when he played in West Indies," Rohit said.
 
 With one left-arm spinner   in the line-up, India may just go with Chahal in the first game at Chepauk on Sunday, but Kuldeep, too, will surely get his chance. Surely, the Aussies have reason to worry.
