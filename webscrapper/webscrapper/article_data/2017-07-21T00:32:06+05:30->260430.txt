Ludhiana: For the first time in the past four years, three outbreaks of   have been reported within 20 days. These outbreaks have mostly occurred because no water sampling was done from April last year onwards. The health department could not take preventive action before hand because of guidelines given by state headquarters.

 This year, diarrhoea outbreaks have been reported in Giaspura, Saholi, and Jawadi, whereas last year, no outbreaks were reported. In 2015, an outbreak was reported only at one place in Baba Jeewan Singh Nagar on Tajpur Road, and two outbreaks were reported in 2014 in village Sihaura under Payal block, and Prakash Singh Nagar of Jawadi.
 
 District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Kumar said: “Outbreaks this year are really major, as they have all been reported before the monsoons. Three areas have faced the outbreak, and one is suspected. The department has taken action at the right time, so that many patients were saved and helped. To control the outbreak in Giaspura, it took 12 days, which is a long time. In a record of the past four years since 2014, a maximum of two areas in the same year have faced the problem. But this year, it is breaking all records. And even the level of bacteria found in water is much higher than the permissible limits.”
 
 While Giaspura had recorded more than 600 patients, Saholi had recorded 160, and Jawadi had 10-12 patients, with the death of a nine-year-old. Two deaths were reported from Saholi as well. Sources from the health department said because of the no routine water sampling done last year, three outbreaks occurred at the same time.
