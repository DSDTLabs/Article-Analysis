AHMEDABAD: As the harvest season sets in, members of communities that have migrated to the city celebrated various New Years from their regions. Festivities gripped the city with celebrations of Vishu and Puthandu among the Malayali and   communities.

 Vishu is observed on the first day of ‘Medam’ month after the solar cycle of the luni solar Hindu calendar. “The traditional thaali was prepared and the day at home began by looking at the thaal and offering prayers. We went to the temple later and then met our loved ones,” said Aswathi Menon, a resident of Thaltej.
 
 The Tamil community in the city celebrated their New Year with faith, feasting and festivities. “Apart from Pachadi, Payasam, rice pudding, was prepared at home, which all of us relished after a long time. A variety of other traditional delicacies were also made at home,” said Anusha Srinivasan, a   resident.
 
 The Bengali community will celebrate their new year on Saturday, on Poila Boisakh. Apart from visiting temples and greeting loved ones, Bengalis in the city will have a community dinner with musical performances and screenings of Bengali films.
