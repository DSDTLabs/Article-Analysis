MUMBAI: The state government has sanctioned Rs 1,161 crore towards compensation of losses reported by farmers, mainly cotton growers hit by a resurgent pest attack in 2017-18.

 
  
 
 The   losses were calculated to be around Rs 3,484 crore and the government decided to release the compensation in three equal instalments.
 
 For the first time, the relief and revenue department made it mandatory for all district collectors to put up the list of beneficiaries online so that anyone can access the list and any complaints can be addressed at the earliest.
 
 Unless the collectors publish this list, the second and third instalment will not be given to them. 
 
 “We wanted the process to be as transparent as possible. Publishing the list of beneficiaries will allow for scrutiny to be done by anyone,” said a senior government official. The state government has sent a memorandum to the Centre seeking assistance for the losses under the National Disaster Relief Fund, but the assistance is yet to come.
 
 As per the state government’s primary survey, pink bollworm and other pests last year affected cotton crop on 34 lakh hectares of land as against the total cotton cultivation area of 43 lakh hectares.
 
 Many parts of eastern   were affected by other pests, which damaged rice and other kharif crops. This prompted the government to increase its coverage of compensation.
 
 “The state government, however, decided to go ahead and disburse its share in the financial assistance to farmers, instead of waiting for the Centre to release its contribution,” said a government official. The funds will be given to district collectors, who will transfer the amount into the accounts of farmers.
 
 The beneficiary farmers’ land records and cultivation crop entries on revenue documents and bank accounts will be verified before the transfer of funds, said the official.
