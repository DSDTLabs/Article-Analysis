INDORE:   workers have decided not to celebrate Holi over alleged ‘slow-pace’ of judicial probe in   case, said a local leader here.

 “On June 6, 2017, five farmers were killed in firing. Judicial inquiry is going on for the past eight months and no result has come out yet,” acting state president of MP Rajiv Vikas Kendra (MPRVK) Devendra Singh said.
 
 He said that the victims’ family members were unhappy with state government’s failure to take action against the guilty.
 
 “The workers and office-bearers of MPRVK are with the farmers and we have decided not to celebrate Holi,” Yadav said.
 
 They paid homage to the deceased by lighting candles at Mahatma Gandhi’s statue at Regal Square.
 
 State government has extended the commission’s deadline twice. Now, they have to submit the report on March 11.
 
 On Thursday, farmers’ advocate cross-examined the then in-charge of   police station in Mandasur Anil Singh Thakur over 104 points.
 
 A week ago, Thakur had appeared before commission for chief examination for over 100 FIRs filed by local police and affected people.
 
 During the day-long proceeding, the advocate cross-examined Thakur over 30 points before the commission headed by high court Judge (retired), JK Jain. The proceeding will resume on March 5.
 
 Out of 30 government officials, around 6 officials including then district magistrate Swatantra Kumar Singh and then superintendent of police OP Tripathi are left from recording their statements before the commission.
