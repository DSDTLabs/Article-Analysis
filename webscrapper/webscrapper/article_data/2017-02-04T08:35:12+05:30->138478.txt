The JDA approved the site plan on condition that only 35% of the said land could be used for construction and the post office was constructed as per the condition.
 
 However, the JDA by an order on January 27 in 2015 cancelled the allotment of 1,668 square meters of land adjoining the post office building. Though the postal department appealed in the JDA tribunal its petition was dismissed on the ground that the JDA had cancelled the allotment for developing a parking space in the area which is also for public purpose on which it approached the high court.
