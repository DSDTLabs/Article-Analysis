AHMEDABAD: Despite directions from the   to collect only  , several   in the city are forcing students to give cheques covering fees for the entire year. In some cases, the schools have even stopped issuing books to students, if the year’s fees were not paid in full.

 Sanjay Devadiya, a chartered accountant said, “My two kids are students of Euro School, Makarba. They were told books will not be given, if I did not pay fees for the first term, and give postdated cheques for the second term.”
 
 “I had informed the administrative head that I was recording the conversation, but they continued without any fear, and reiterated they would not give books, if I did not give the cheques,” said Devadiya, adding that he has had a telephonic conversation with education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, and sent him a letter.
 
 Meanwhile, managements of several CBSE schools have already informed parents that they will not be implementing the new law from this academic year. 
 
 “The management of my son’s school has made it clear that the   has begun from April, and the fees too have been collected before the Act has come into effect,” said a parent whose son studies in a CBSE school.
 
 “School managements cannot be forced to implement the new law as the session has already begun before the Act has been implemented. We will implement the reduction, if any, from next academic year,” said an official of a CBSE school. tnn
