NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old man was stabbed to death by his   over   issues. The victim was stabbed multiple times after he parked his scooty in front of the accused house at Gautam Puri in southeast Delhi.

 DCP (crime) Bhisham Singh said the accused, Nitin (30), was arrested from Najafgarh and has been booked under sections of murder. He had recently come out of jail and had gone to meet the victim on the day of the incident.
 
 The incident happened on April 18 when two families clashed over parking of a scooty. The victim, Ashok, and his neighbour Anil got into an argument which snowballed into a fistfight where Anil suffered head injuries. Hearing this, Anilâ€™s relative Nitin, along with his brother Mithun and nephew Vishal came out of the house and attacked Ashok with knives. They stabbed him multiple times and fled from the spot. Ashok was taken to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead.
 
 A team led by ACP Aditya Gautam was tipped off that the accused would be coming to Old Kakrola Road on Sunday. The team laid a trap and arrested Nitin.
 
 During interrogation, Nitin told police he was earlier working as a parking attendant in south Delhi. In 2016, he was arrested in a case of POCSO and Arms Act and was jailed for three months. Later, he was arrested for pickpocketing. 
 
 Nitin told cops that he had started living in Noida after coming out of jail and had gone to Gautam Puri to meet his family on that day. A manhunt is on for the other accused.
