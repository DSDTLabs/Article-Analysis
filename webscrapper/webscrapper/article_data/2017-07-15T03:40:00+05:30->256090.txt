Bogmalo: With an aim to solve 50% of Panaji’s problems, authorities are planning to create a dedicated control and command centre.  Speaking at the IEEE WIE International Leadership Summit 2017 at Bogmalo, Swayandipta Pal Chaudhuri, CEO of Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Ltd (IPSCD) said that the usage of technology would be a vital instrument in converting the state’s capital into a smart city. “One of the key aspects that we are planning to incorporate in the smart city project is a control and command centre. We have our own premises at the old secretariat building and we are expecting to house it there. Under the project, we are planning to install 200-300 high resolution advanced cameras having the capability for facial and number plate recognition capabilities,” Chaudhari said, adding that the tendering process is going to start in the next two weeks and the system to be rolled out in the next six months. Reacting to Chaudhuri’s proposed plans, solutions architect Subodh Gajare highlighted that authorities need to take measures to protect technology from unethical forces. “We have to make sure that we catch the problem before it happens. Tech companies are currently working three steps ahead of unethical forces to safeguard data and technologies but 99% of the times, governments are found in a reactive situation, after the hacking has happened,” he said.  “Every department in the Union government has a nodal officer for the Smart City project. The SP (North) has been made the nodal officer for the project here,” he said.
