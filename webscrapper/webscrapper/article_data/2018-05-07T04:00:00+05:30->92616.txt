Vadodara: The usually tranquil Vishwamitri ghats near Kala Ghoda Circle came alive early on Sunday morning as enthusiastic children gathered there in large numbers.  Equipped with canvas, crayons and creative imagination, over 100 kids from the city made paintings of birds, crocodiles and the river. Nature Walk — a city-based group — had organized the painting event to educate children about the natural environs around them.  “Since the time we started living urban lives and got tap water supply, we moved away from the water bodies. Most of the children don’t know much about Vishwamitri River that passes through the heart of the city,” said Dr Jitendra Gavali, member of the Nature Walk.  “So we decided to organize a painting event right on the historic ghats of the river so that the kids come close to the river. The kids didn’t just make colourful paintings but enjoyed being close to the nature and understanding the value of this river,” said Lovanyasen Singh, who came up with the idea of organizing such gathering. Next Sunday, the paintings made by the children will be displayed on the same ghats and a cultural programme will also be organized there. The Nature Walk has been organizing awareness programmes and also taking on VMC on the need to save Vishwamiti River and its eco-system.
