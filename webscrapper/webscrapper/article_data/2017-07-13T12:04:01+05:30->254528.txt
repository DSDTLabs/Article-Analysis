 CHANDIGARH: Vegetable rates have started to fluctuate ever since the arrival of monsoon in various parts of the country. After going sky high, the rates have come down a bit this week.
 
 As compared to last week prices, tomatoes have become cheaper from Rs 60 per kg to Rs 45-50 per kg. Prices of vegetables like gourd and lady’s finger have also come down from Rs 60 per kg to Rs 35-50 per kg.
 
 According to vendors, good supply and stock of vegetables have resulted in the lowering of prices.
 
 “During these months, vegetation in plains of   dips which is why vegetables have to be transported from Himachal Pradesh. Due to this, there is constant fluctuation in prices of vegetables,” said Bittu, a wholesaler at the Sector 26 Sabzi Mandi.
 
 Ranjan Kumar, secretary of market committee, UT, Chandigarh, said, “The fluctuation in prices is seasonal. Prices rise as vegetables like peas get transported from   during this season. Once the season is over, supply will resume from Punjab which will bring down the prices. It all depends on the arrival of vegetables.”
 
 Meanwhile, buyers turned up in less numbers at the mandi on Wednesday. The constant rain since morning had led to water stagnation and mud puddles everywhere which caused trouble for buyers. Fruit and vegetable waste was also seen floating in these muddy waters.
 
 “There is very less sale of peas as it rained since morning. I’ve been sitting here since 7am and I’ve hardly got any customer,” said Ranjan Kumar, a pea seller at Sector 26 sabzi mandi.
