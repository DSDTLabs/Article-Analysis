SITAMARHI/PATNA: A day after Riga Sugar Mill Workers’ Union president Om Prakash Rai was shot dead on Sunday,   on Monday woke up to the news of the murder of a billionaire elderly couple. 

 Bharat Prasad (75) and Mandvi Devi (70), owners of several movable and immovable properties worth crores in Sitamarhi and other districts, were found strangulated inside their residence located under the Town police station area.
 
 Sadar SDPO K V Dhirendra said the couple had hired a private security guard. He was, however, found injected with either a drug or poison by the criminals. He is undergoing treatment at the sadar hospital.
 
 “The guard has told police the assailants were five in number and had come riding two bikes. The couple seems to have been poisoned as well,” said the police officer.
 
 Fingerprint experts from Patna forensic experts from   have reached the spot to assist police investigations.
 
 “Bharat was earlier a landlord. His younger brother Shatrughan Prasad was his neighbour. He hasn’t been seen since morning,” the SDPO said and added Shatrughan’s wife Anita Jaiswal was shot dead in August last year.
 
 The deceased couple’s only son has settled in Australia. Police are trying to contact him and other relatives.
 
 After the crime, the killers had taken away the couple’s car. It was later found abandoned on NH-77 under the Bathnaha police station area in the district.
 
 Town police station SHO Anil Kumar Sharma said the two bodies were lying on sofas in the drawing hall. “Police also found towels which were apparently used to strangulate them. There are CCTV cameras installed in the house, but the assailants had taken away the recorder’s hard disk drive,” the SHO said and added neighbours spotted the guard lying unconscious around 6am.
