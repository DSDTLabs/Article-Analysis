AJMER: Even as most regions of the state are receiving good rainfall, Bisalpur Dam, the lifeline for Jaipur and Ajmer, is still waiting for good amount of water. The water level gauge of the   on Monday remained at 311.95 metres, it still needs a lot of water to overflow like last year. Bisalpur Dam received 9 cm water this season which means drinking water for three days for Jaipur and Ajmer. Officials stated that water is not coming to the dam and Triveni- the point where water comes to the dam from different direction is still not flowing.

 The reason for the dam still not receiving good amount of water is because the regions of Bhilwara and Chittorgrah have so far not received good showers. “In the last two years, monsoon entered   from southern part and reached Bhilwara and Chittorgarh after crossing Kota. But this time, monsoon has entered from western side of the state and therefore, Mount Abu, Pali, Sirohi and Jodhpur are getting good rainfall,” said an official with the Met department. Bisalpur Dam has a height of 15.5 meters. It still needs more than 3 metres of water which means it needs good rains in Bhilwara and Chittorgrah regions. In the last two years the gates of the dam were mostly opened in the month of September. Officials are hopeful that there will be enough rains and the dam will fill up sufficiently.
