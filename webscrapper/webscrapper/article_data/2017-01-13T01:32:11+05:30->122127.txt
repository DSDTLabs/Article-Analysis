BHUBANESWAR: Days ahead of the panchayat polls, the CBI on Thursday dealt a blow to Biju   (BJD) when it raided the homes of an MP, an MLA and an office staff of chief minister   for their alleged involvement in the Seashore Group chit fund scam.

 Patnaik is seen as being close to the BJP-led government at the Centre and had come out strongly in support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. On the other hand,   chief minister Mamata Banerjee had linked her opposition to the note ban to the arrest of   netas by the CBI for their alleged links to chit fund scams.
 
 The close aides of Patnaik who were raided were Choudwar-Cuttack legislator Pravat Biswal, Balasore Lok Sabha MP Rabindra Jena and Naveen’s aide Saroj Sahoo. The raid on Sahoo’s house is significant as he is considered to be close to the CM. Jena, whose houses in Balasore and Delhi were raided, was last week summoned by the CBI to appear for interrogation on Thursday. He was earlier interrogated by the CBI in January 2015 while Biswal and Sahoo were questioned in November 2014.
 
 The CBI, which conducted simultaneous raids at 36 locations in Odisha and other states, also searched the house of Congress’s Arindam Sarkhel (Bapi), arrested recently for his alleged role in the murder of a top executive of Hyderabadbased Seaways Shipping and Logistics Pvt Ltd last October.
