KOLKATA: Waking up to the concerns raised by the East-West Metro authorities on the precarious condition of some buildings on Old Court House Street,   ( ) has put up ‘Beware’ and ‘Dangerous Building’ boards on them. In a separate letter, the civic body has also asked owners of three buildings (8, 9 and 10 Old Court House Street) to repair the structures and demolish the rickety portions within a fortnight.

 “We appreciate that   has brought the condition of these buildings to our notice. We inspected them and took necessary action,” a KMC engineer said. A KMC team had inspected the houses last Friday and submitted the report to the civic director-general (building) on Tuesday.
 
 The KMC boards have been put up next to KMRC notices that were put up by the implementing agency last Wednesday, asking occupants of five ramshackle buildings along Old Court House Street to vacate their premises from the third week of January.
 
 The KMC letter, which has been pasted along with the board, says that punitive actions can be taken in case of non-compliance.
 
 “The time allotted is good enough because the west-bound tunnel boring machine (TBM) would pass below these buildings from January 25,” said a senior KMRC official. The agency has started grouting and strengthening of the buildings.
 
 A KMC engineer in charge of buildings in Ward 46 (BBD Bag area) said, “The boards have been put up to make the public aware of the dangerous condition of the buildings. It’s of no use serving letters to the owners or occupants privately. They tend to ignore them. But if everyone can see the boards and the notices, there will be pressure on the occupants to comply with the KMC order.”
