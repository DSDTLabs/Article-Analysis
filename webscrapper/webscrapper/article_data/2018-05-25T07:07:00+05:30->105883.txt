Ludhiana: Imagine playing basketball at the top of a hill in cold? Well, it might send cold shivers down your spine but for competitive athletes, participating in a high-altitude training camp, is a welcome change and can help them to improve their lung capacity and overall fitness.

 Here’s good news for city sports enthusiasts. Finally, the sports branch of the education department is all set to organise a high-altitude training camp for the junior players this summer vacation. The 20-day training camp, which will be held from June 8 to 28 in Sundar Nagar, Himachal Pradesh, will improve the stamina and overall fitness of the athletes and hockey, kabaddi players of the district. 
 
 The trail for the selection of the players in nine sports including hockey, kabaddi, softball and basketball for the upcoming summer training camp was held at Guru Nanak Stadium Ludhiana on Thursday here.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Rupinder Ravi, state education officer, said, “The sports branch of education department will organise high-altitude summer training camp for the players in nine sporting events.”
 
 A total of 400 players will be selected from the district. Apart from free accommodation, players will be given proper diet and training during their stay in Sundar Nagar.
 
 One of the major reasons behind organizing the summer training camp in the hills is the sweltering heat in the city. Most of the time the players fail to practice enough due to the hot and humid climate in the city. The organisers believe this is the best time to train a sports person and prepare them for the upcoming national and state-level matches.
 
 The players will have to go through high endurance training session during their stay in Himachal Pradesh. The players need to be prepared to endure all kind of challenges in cold weather situations. Sources in the sports department said earlier Punjab sports department had organised a high-altitude training camp for the athletes during summer vacations. However, for the past two-three years, they failed to organise another camp due to cash crisis.
