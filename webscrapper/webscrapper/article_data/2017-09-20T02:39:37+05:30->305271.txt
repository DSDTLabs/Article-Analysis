THANE: A panic-like situation engulfed the city on Tuesday after   and   caused a feeling of deja vu of the August 29 rains. 

 As the downpour intensified by mid afternoon, residents started circulating messages to their loved ones via social networking sites and mobile applications cautioning each other. 
 
 With the cloudy skies giving way to an early sunset coupled with bolts of lightening, the panic mode had set in by 5pm. Thaneites who were stranded in the deluge of 29/8 for hours together were seen running helter skelter in a bid to take necessary precautions in the wake of Tuesday’s torrential rains.
 
 Vinav Nair, a resident, said, “In the downpour of August 29, my bike, which was parked on the premises of my office was damaged and completely submerged in water. Since the office is located near my residence, I went home during lunch time and parked my bike in the parking lot of my building, which is at an elevated level. Then I took an auto and went back to office.”
 
 Some office-goers said they were trying to leave early on Tuesday afternoon fearing a repeat of the August 29  . 
 
 Meanwhile, those living in the low-lying pockets of the city were contemplating shifting their belongings to the lofts, so as to tackle a situation like 29/8 if it were to happen.
 
 Laxmi Bhandari from Thane’s Nalpada area near the Kapurbawdi pipeline, said, “I was in my native town of Uttarakhand when I heard the news about the week’s forecast. I immediately called up my daughters at home and told them to safeguard our valuables. Last time, the water had ventured into our slum tenement and destroyed all important documents. We have shifted most of our belongings to the loft upstairs.”
