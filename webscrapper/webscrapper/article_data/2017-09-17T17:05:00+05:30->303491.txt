Nagpur: The Indian cotton industry seems to be moving towards a better future, especially with the country planning to revive the technology mission on cotton, said Suresh Kotak, chairman Kotak and Co Pvt Ltd. Kotak was here to attend the three-day seventh Asian Cotton Research and Development Network (ACRDN) meeting being hosted by the Indian Society for Cotton Improvement. Kotak said that the technology mission included three mini missions to create a concept of brand India for cotton. It has plans of meeting the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi by doubling the income of the farmers. The government needs to take a stand against the contamination of cotton during the collection, both willingly and by chance. The cotton is contaminated and adulterated purposely. But the government should not tolerate this as it is turning out to be self-destructive process. It is tarnishing the image of Indian cotton in the international market, said Kotak. Central as well as state governments should now frame regulations to prevent cotton contamination and mixing of cotton waste in the cotton. It is a malpractice which needs to be ended to prevent the cotton economy from dwindling further, he added. Kotak said that system should be ruthless to all those involved in the value chain of the cotton who engage in adulteration of cotton. Kotak said that considering all the factors of market conditions this year a total of 365 lakh cotton bales may come in the Indian market. Of course there is a plus-minus 3% tolerance associated with it. The market price of cotton the coming season may range from Rs36500 to 42500 per candy (two units of 170kg each).  It also means that the cotton price could reach 5000-5200 per quintal. Kotak said that in the international market the cotton prices may range from 68 cents/lb to 75 cents/lb. “The prices also will depend on the political factors which have a bearing on the pricing of cotton,” he said.
