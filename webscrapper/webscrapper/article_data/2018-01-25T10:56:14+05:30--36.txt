TIRUNELVELI: The one-day bandh jointly organized by trade unions and public transport carriers in   affected inter-state transport at Kaliyakkavilai in Kanyakumari district and Sengottai in Tirunelveli district on Wednesday. The bandh was to protest against the steadily escalating price of petrol and diesel.

 Students and working people who travel from   and   areas to Thiruvananthapuram every day were among the worst-hit. Usually, 88 government buses ply from Kanyakumari and Nagercoil to Thiruvananthapuram and vice-versa, making 264 round trips every day. More than 40 buses operated by   (KSRTC) did not operate from the early hours of the day. The remaining buses operated by the   (TNSTC) from Kanyakumari and Nagercoil to Thiruvananthapuram stopped at Kaliyakkavilai.
 
 The strike coupled with the TNSTC ticket fare hike reflected at railway stations which witnessed a mad rush. Commuters unaware of the strike in Kerala who were heading to Neyyattinkara, Balaramapuram and Thiruvananthapuram got down at Kaliyakkavilai and boarded trains to the destinations from Parassala onwards. Normalcy returned around 6 pm when the strike came to an end. However, only a few services were operated based on the passenger movement. Early in the morning, some long-distance buses from Chennai to Thiruvananthapuram hesitantly made their way into Kerala as only some of them crossed Kaliyakkavilai to reach the destination before the strike commenced at 6 am.
 
 TNSTC and State Express Transport Corporation buses from Tirunelveli to Alappuzha, Thrissur, Guruvayoor, Ernakulam and other destinations in Kerala stopped operations at the inter-state border at Punalur near Sengottai.
 
 A few trucks and goods carrier vans carrying vegetables, flowers and fish from Tirunelveli and Tuticorin entered Kerala before dawn, before commencement of the strike. However lorries that could not make it before 6 am waited at Piranoor border, Sengottai and   till the bandh came to an end.
