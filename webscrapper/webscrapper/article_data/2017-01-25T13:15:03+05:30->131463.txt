Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘Raees’ has released alongside Hrithik Roshan’s ‘Kaabil’ at cinemas. Hoping to cash in on the Republic Day weekend, the makers of both films have resorted to some clever tactics to promote and pitch the films to cine goers. ‘Kaabil’ producer   organised a special screening of the film for his family and close friends. 

 While leaving the venue, the producer was asked if he would watch ‘Raees’, to which he laughed it off saying, “No! I will watch ‘Kaabil’ once again.”
