CHANDIGARH: Even a month after the  , nearly 80,000 students of   in   are yet to get money for buying summer uniforms and notebooks. 

 The students are entitled to get the money for uniforms and notebooks under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. In 2015, UT education department had decided to start transferring money into the accounts of students, while scrapping the tender system which was earlier used to provide uniforms to the students. 
 
 The aim was to ensure that students get their uniforms in time. In the summers of 2015 and 2016 too, the administration had delayed the transfer of money. 
 
 Last winter, the education department transferred the funds around the end of December. As per students’ passbooks, there is no uniformity in transfer of money. 
 
 The passbook of one of the students showed money for notebooks, Rs 123, was transferred just once in 2015. In 2017, no money had been transferred so far.  , a teacher and the president of UT Cadre Educational Employees Association, said, “My daughter is studying in Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 37. She only got money for the winter uniform in 2015. I realized it after I saw the passbook that there was no money given for the summers of 2015 and 2016. The education department is careless in this regard.” 
 
 “Earlier, in the tender system, students at least got the uniforms. In this transfer of money system, parents and students are harassed,” he said. UT director (school education)   said he will look into the matter on Monday.
