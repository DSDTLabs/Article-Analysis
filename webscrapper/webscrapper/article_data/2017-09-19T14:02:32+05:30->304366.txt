CHENNAI: The Schedule 10 of the Constitution or the anti-defection law has been invoked in Tamil Nadu after a gap of 17 years. The last time the law was invoked was in 2000 when DMK MLA M Muthuramalingam joined the AIADMK. Muthuramalingam had won on a DMK ticket from Thirumangalam in Madurai district but when he joined AIADMK, he attracted the anti-defection law and was disqualified. 

 So far, Tamil Nadu has deen the defeat of no confidence motions on 12 occasions and adoption of vote of confidence motion four times. 
 
 In 1995, two former AIADMK ministers G Viswanathan and Alagu Thirunavukarasu were disqualified after they joined MDMK. Earlier, the famous disqualification of 33 MLAs by speaker P H Pandian in 1988 after the death of former chief minister   grabbed headlines. The anti-defection law came into effect in 1985 to prevent frequent crossing over of legislators from one party to another. 
 
 “Between the years 2000 and 2017, Schedule 10 could have been used at least twice, but the respective party whips did not press for it. The first time was between 2011 and 2016 when eight DMDK MLAs rebelled against the party leadership and were treated as a separate group. The DMDK did not press for action under the anti-defection law as they would have lost their opposition party status,” a former assembly secretary told TOI. 
 
 Similarly, the AIADMK did not press for disqualification of 11 MLAs supporting AIADMK (Puratchithalaivi Amma) and Mylapore MLA R Natraj who voted against the whip issued on February 18 when the Edappadi K Palaniswami government moved the confidence motion. “While the speaker has disqualified 18 MLAs even without their defying a whip, there is a stronger case for disqualification of the 12 (OPS group) MLAs, who voted against the government in February this year,” he said.
