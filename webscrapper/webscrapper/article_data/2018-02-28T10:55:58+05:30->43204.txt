 "When I first came to London, I shared a house with three girlfriends and then four more people joined us. I wanted this film to feel like it's set today, and for audiences to feel like it starts off in a place where you can relate to her," she added. Adding to the relatability, the London-set scenes avoid landmarks and are sticking to the grimier back streets.
