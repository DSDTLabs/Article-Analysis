NAGPUR: Close on the heels of two leopards dying under mysterious circumstances two days ago near Khapa, a tigress and two sambars were electrocuted in a farm on Surewani road near  . In the last 12 days, one tigress, four leopards and two sambars have died in Nagpur and   divisions.

 The four-year-old tigress is suspected to have died after it came in contact with live electric wire fencing of the farm. Two sambars too died the same way. Maharkund is a lake surrounded by dense forest.
 
 The farm is owned by Shantaram Burde of Khapa. He has let it out to one   of Tembhurdoh, who is the main suspect. According to sources, one sambar was thrown on the road to mislead the forest officials.
 
 Later, Sawalakhe tried to bury another sambar after chopping its skull and also the tigress in a pit. “We could trace the carcass of the animals with the help of a sniffer dog. We have also collected tripping data from the MSEDCL,” said Nagpur deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) G Mallikarjuna.
 
 Sources said that post-mortem would be conducted on Saturday morning as per   protocol.
 
 According to Nitin Desai, Central India director of  , like it has happened in the past, electrocution during rabi season has turned out to be the biggest threat to wild animals.
 
 “In this season, a system of sending real-time line tripping information by the electricity substation staff to the respective range forest office has to be in place and working. The issue has been discussed numerous times at various fora including tiger cells but little has changed on the ground,” Desai said.
 
 “It is high time the agencies put their act together and go hammer and tongs after the poachers and the MSEDCL should launch a special drive against illegal power fencings,” he said.
