BENGALURU: A 34-year-old   has been arrested for allegedly   studying in his   several times over the past 10 months in south Bengaluru.

 Mohammed Abdul Zuber, a native of Hindupur, Andhra Pradesh, has been booked under the provisions of Pocso Act as well as IPC section 377 (unnatural sex) on the basis of a complaint filed by the boy’s parents. 
 
 The incident came to light on Friday when the boy complained to his grandmother about the abusive behaviour of the teacher. Alerted by her, the parents lodged a complaint the same day.
 
 “Zuber used to take the boy to his residence in Shivajinagar and a temporary room he had been provided by his employer in Avalahalli and abuse him. Both the accused and the boy have been subjected to medical examination,” a police officer said.
 
 Talaghattapura police said the boy has been sexually abused for at least 10 months continuously. The boy is a third standard student at the madrassa.
 
 The boy told police that he resisted Zuber, who, however, had his way by threatening him with dire consequences. The boy gathered courage a couple of months ago and told his grandmother about the incident. Initially she ignored it but took it seriously only when the boy complained again on Friday. She immediately apprised the boy’s parents of the matter.
 
 Zuber has been working in the madrassa for the past four years. He was earlier working with another madrassa in east Bengaluru. Zuber and his family had moved to Bengaluru from Hindupur several years ago and were staying in Shivajinagar.
 
 There are about 60 students in the madrassa. Police said they have not found anything yet to say Zuber had sexually abused other students.
