SURAT: Police booked an income tax (I-T) officer along with his mother on Tuesday for abetting suicide of his 29-year-old wife, who jumped to death from the terrace of a 12-storey building after throwing their three-year-old son on the ground from the heights at Pal in Adajan the previous day. Both had died on the spot. Police are yet to make any arrest in the case as family members have gone to their native place for last rites of the deceased.

 Police booked Rammaher Nain and his mother   for abetting suicide of Chanchal on the complaint of  , brother of the deceased woman. Before jumping, Rammaher’s wife Chanchal had flung their three-year-old son Aniket from the terrace. 
 
 She was upset since both Rajbala and Rammaher had stopped talking to her after some dispute. The couple got married four years ago. The complainant alleged that his sister was facing severe mental torture since long. He told police that she had informed her family over phone before committing suicide that her husband and mother-in-law were not talking to her ever since their return from   four days ago. 
 
 “Chanchal had informed her husband on Monday morning that Rajbala was not talking to her. Rammaher told her that he will talk to her only if his mother talks. The accused informed police about this issue on Monday,” police said.
 
 The woman took the extreme step after a heated argument with her husband on Monday. Bura alleged in his complaint that the accused were mentally torturing Chanchal over petty issues for the past many months. Differences further deepened between the couple on their return to the city from Haryana four days ago after attending last rites of a family member there, informed police.
