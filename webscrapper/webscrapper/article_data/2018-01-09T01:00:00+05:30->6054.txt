PATNA: State disaster management department (DMD) on Monday organised the first-of-its-kind ‘Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Infothon-2018’ in collaboration with Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC). The competition was organised in order to give recognition to organisations for uploading knowledge resources in relation to disaster risk reduction to   (Surakshit Bihar Ka Lakshya) platform, an online portal dedicated to local solutions for disaster risk reduction.

 Around 50 people, including DRR practitioners, academics, students, NGOs and researchers participated in the one-day competition. The competition was divided into three categories. 
 
 Central University of South Bihar won the award for uploading highest number of knowledge resources in all categories to the online portal. Catholic Relief Services, on the other hand, received an award for sharing the highest number of knowledge resources related to drought. Partners of the community-based DRR network of UNICEF – Samajik Chetna Kendra, Bihar Sewa Samiti and Ghoghardiha Prakhand Swaraj Vikas Sangh – won the award for highest number of knowledge resources contributed for a particular theme, ‘Resilient Villages’.
 
 “Infothon was aimed at engaging creative and thoughtful minds to work together from different domains and share their knowledge and experience in order to create awareness about DRR. Bihar is the only state in the country that has adopted a systematic road map for disaster risk reduction,” said Pratyaya Amrit, principal secretary, DMD.
 
 “SAMBAL operates as a network that shares useful knowledge resources for reducing the risk of disaster and climate variability. The portal is for use by policymakers, DRM practitioners and community leaders. It houses policy documents, standard operating procedures, practice documents such as case studies, training modules, manuals and working papers that may serve as a ready reference for the design of programmes and policies,” Amrit added.
