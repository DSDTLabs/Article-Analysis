New Delhi:   won her first   (ISSF) World Cup medal- silver in the Women’s   (3P) event at the ongoing   Rifle/Pistol/Shotgun stage in Guadalajara, Mexico. 

 
 
 On day six of competition and on a windy day making shooting very difficult during the finals, Anjum shot brilliantly to finish behind China’s Ruijiao Pei 455.4 to 454.2 after the 45-shot final. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 China’s Ting Sun claimed Bronze, finishing with a score of 442.2. This was India’s eighth medal of the competition and the first silver after having won three Golds and four Bronze medals already, for their best ISSF World Cup performance by far, till date.
 
 
 
 
 
 Anjum remained in medal contention from the beginning of the final and at the end of the 15-shot kneeling position stood third behind Ruijiao and Slovakia’s Ziva Dvorsak. 
 
 She pulled into the lead after the second 5-shot prone position series, which followed the kneeling position and was 0.9 points clear of German world number one Jolyn Beer at the end of it. 
 
 After the 15-shot prone series she was still in the lead however after the 10th shot of the last standing series when the first two finalists out of the eight were eliminated, Anjum had gone down to fourth position.
 
 A brilliant 10.8 in the 41st shot took her up to second and she maintained that position finishing with scores of 10.2, 10.1, 9.5 and 10.2 to secure a deserving Silver medal.
 
  Earlier in qualification, Anjum rode on the back of a solid prone round of 399 out of 400 to log a combined 1170 and sail through to the eight woman final in second place behind China’s Ruijiao Pei who shot a qualification world record score of 1178. 
 
 Gaayathri was well in contention for a finals place after the kneeling and prone rounds but a 371 out of 400 in the standing round meant that she would have to be content with a 15th place finish totaling 1153. 
 
 Former prone World Champion Tejaswini Sawant also shot the same score but finished a spot behind Gaayathri because of three less inner 10s.
 
 In the Men’s 25m Rapid Fire Pistol it was heartbreak for 15-year old Anish Bhanwala, who stood third after the first precision round with a solid 294 and a real chance to make it amongst the top six finalists. However after looking comfortable in the second rapid fire round on Thursday- beginning with a solid 99 and following up with a 97, scores of 7,9,10,8,8 in the final series of five shots pulled him down to seventh place. 
 
 Anish ended with 578, the same score as sixth place qualifier Zhaonan Hao of China, but with one lesser 10 than the Chinese. Neeraj Kumar, the second India in the fray, also had a similar last series to finish with 569 and in 13th place.
 
 India still lead the medals tally with eight medals (3 Gold, 1 Silver, 4 Bronze) while China is in second and catching up with five medals till now (2 Gold, 2 Silver, 1 bronze)
 
 Medal events resume on the weekend with three finals, the Men’s 3P, the Women’s 25m Pistol and Women’s Skeet slated for Saturday, while the World Cup concludes competitions on Sunday with the Men’s Skeet final.
