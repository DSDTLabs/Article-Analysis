HYDERABAD: A team of city doctors recently successfully performed a complex heart surgery on a three-day-old baby girl who was diagnosed with a condition known as Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA), a congenital heart problem. That the baby weighed only 1,400 gms, made the surgery a risky affair, said doctors.

The baby's four-cm-long heart had to be brought to a stop for 75 minutes."
 
 According to the team of 12 specialists, the baby's oxygen saturation levels were 40% before surgery, as against average of 95-100%.
 
 "In such defects, the aorta which is supposed to come from the left side of the heart was arising from the right and the lung artery which is supposed to go left from the right side of the heart was arising from the left. This made it impossible for the child to survive without a surgery," said Dr Dash, who headed the team of doctors who performed the surgery in the last week of March.
 
 The baby recovered in five days and recorded a 100% oxygen saturation rate. The procedure was performed under the  .
