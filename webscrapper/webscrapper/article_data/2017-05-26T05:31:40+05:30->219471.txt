PUNE: The detection of   tuberculosis (MDR-TB), which took a backseat following an   of   across the state, has now resumed.

 The Union health ministry has provided 48,000 cartridges to Maharashtra soon after TOI published a news report (on May18) on how the shortage had jeopardised rapid detection and hence subsequent treatment of suspected patients, putting them at an increased risk of associated complications. 
 
 “The shortage of testing cartridges has been resolved. We have already supplied the cartridges to centres facing the shortage. With this, the detection of MDR-TB among suspected patients has resumed with renewed vigour,” state tuberculosis officer   said.
 
 A total of 72 centres with   in Maharashtra were facing a shortage of Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT), which gives out test report within two hours. The shortage was prevailing since the beginning of this month.
 
 On an average, every CBNAAT or GeneXpert centre tests around 250 samples every month. That accounts for a total of 18,000 tests per month. Among them, an average of 400 patients test positive for MDR-TB in the state every month.
 
 Of the 72 CBNAAT centres, the maximum 24 machines are in Mumbai alone. Union healthy ministry’s Central TB Division provides the cartridges to state, which in turn, offers free diagnosis to the patients.
 
 City tuberculosis officer   said, “We have been allocated required number of cartridges. The shortage of testing kits has been resolved.”
