It has been a rather busy season for our tele personalities, given the festivities surrounding this season. One look at their social media profiles and you will get a glimpse at the colourful celebrations theyâ€™ve been part of. While some suited up for special episodes of the daily soaps and programmes they are part of, others posed pretty with family members in their ethnic finery. Be it the newly-married   who was togged in panche and shalya for the festival or   who showed us her funny bone being dressed up in a Mysore peta and Sandalwood garlands with her daughter, or  ,   and   who chose to flaunt their traditional best in their serials/programmes, we have it all covered. The pictures, we are sure, will speak more.
