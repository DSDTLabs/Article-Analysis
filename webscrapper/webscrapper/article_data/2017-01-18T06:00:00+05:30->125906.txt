Visakhapatnam: The central and state governments are working for the benefit of multinational companies by providing them with bauxite reserves and coffee yield as well as suppressing the ongoing anti-bauxite agitations in the Visakha Agency, said the Maoist East Division Committee. 

 In a press note released by the committee on Tuesday, its secretary Kailasam urged the people to raise their voices against atrocities faced by tribals. “Rural SP Rahuldev Sharma, officer on special duty (anti-naxal operations) A Babujee, as well as the Narsipatnam ASP and Paderu DSP have been terrorising the tribals in the guise of Janamaitri, Gramadarsini and other community policing activities,” Kailasam said. 
 
 “The governments have already gifted the hills to multinational companies for mining bauxite reserves. They have also taken away hundreds of hectares of forest land from the tribals to produce coffee and supply the yield to corporate firms at a low price,” he added. 
 
 Kailasam also accused the cops of not respecting the constitution and spending the people’s money at their own will. “Cops work for the benefit of the ruling parties,” he said.
