BHUBANESWAR: A teacher who had been involved in a lone campaign to check open defecation in the city has been roped in by the   (BSCL) for a sustained effort in the regard.

 Mohammad Irshad Ali, a teacher at an Urdu school at Shantipalli in Saheed Nagar had been meeting slum dwellers every morning to make them aware of the ills of open defecation. "I wake up at 4 am every day and visit the nearby field where people come for defecation. I literally keep a vigil and dissuafe people from defecating in the open," said Irshad. "I often have to face their anger. We should keep our surroundings clean. Strangely, many people have toilets at home but they prefer to go out to defecate. This practice has to be stopped," said the crusader. Irshad also urges people to gather during namaz to avoid open defecation. The BSCL has been spearheading a movement to create Open-Defecation Free (ODF) areas in the   (BTCD) area. The ward 53 has been declared Open-Defecation Free recently. 
 
 Before being roped in by the BSCL, Irshad kickstarted the drive simply by involving people from his community. "As more men in the community came forward to join him in the cause, the woman folk also came forward to spread the message of cleanliness," said Raza Khan, a community member. 
 
 Irshad hopes that the area he belongs to will soon be declared open-defecation free, like ward 53. 
 
 In the BTCD area, there are 24 slums and BSCL plans to clean all of them by checking open defecation by the end of June.
