HYDERABAD: The widespread menace of carbide-ripened fruits, responsible for causing arsenic and phosphorous poisoning, came to the fore once again on Monday with the authorities cancelling the licences of 91 fruit shops in the   for using it.

 While traders took to the streets in protest against the move and threatened to shut down the market from Tuesday onwards, agriculture minister   rushed to the spot to pacify the angry vendors.
 
 The minister reasoned saying that action was taken as the fruit-sellers have been avoiding repeated warnings from the authorities.
 
 Artificially-ripened fruits can cause headaches, nausea, fever, gastric issue, ulcers and even skin rashes.Hundreds of trucks carrying mangoes were barred from entering the market on Sunday night. Farmers said that if the fruits were not unloaded by Monday , they will get spoilt and hence, result in massive losses for them.
 
 The authorities managed to convince vendors and farmers to keep the wholesale fruit market open.
 
 Meanwhile, insiders ad mitted that most of the fruits available in city markets are chemically ripened.
 
 “Farmers are in a hurry to sell off their produce. So, carbide is used to ripen and sell them in the fruit market.The fruits are ready to be consumed. We cannot really store them any longer,“ said a vendor. Farmers and traders resort to artificial ripening to avoid over-supply at a particular time that can lower the prices. Since the actual time to have mangoes is by the end of April or beginning of June, traders indulge in this practice to meet the supply at the off season and do some business. Vendors at   ( ), who purchase their stock with borrowed money or on credit from the wholesale traders at Kothapet fruit market, will also get affected, some fruitsellers said. The sale of fruits at Moazzam Jahi market dropped by 70% during demonetisation.
