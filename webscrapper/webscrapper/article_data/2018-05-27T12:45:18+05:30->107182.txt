LUCKNOW: Flexing her muscles before the formation of an “anti-BJP front”,   supremo   on Saturday said her party would enter into an alliance with other parties only if it was given a respectable number of seats or else it would contest the general elections alone. 

 
 Addressing the party’s national executive meeting, Mayawati said though talks on alliance with parties in UP and other states were on, workers should be ready for any situation. “The talks for coalition are on but the cadres should be prepared to keep the party flag high in all situations,” she said. 
 
 Referring to alliance with arch rival  , she said, “Time had come to oust   in national interest.” Giving strong indications that she is in no mood to let go of the party’s control in her lifetime, Mayawati said “when the party president will not be able to travel ahead in life due to age, he/she will don the role of national convener who would appoint the national president”.
 
 She told workers that some selfish and opportunist leaders were trying to promote their family members in the party. “My younger brother, 

 
   Anand Kumar, 
 
 who held the position of vice-president, offered to step down in the interest of the Dalit movement and to serve as an ordinary worker,” she added. 
 
 Mayawati also effected an organisational rejig by appointing 
  replacing Ram Achal Rajbhar who was elevated as national general secretary. Kushwaha, who has been with BSP since 2002, had contested against UPA chief   from Rae Bareli
