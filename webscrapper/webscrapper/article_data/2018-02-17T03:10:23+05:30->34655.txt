NEW DELHI: Ahead of the   plenary session,   on Friday dissolved its apex decision-making body - the   - and replaced it with a "steering committee".

 
 The AICC session is held after the election of the Congress president and ratifies the top appointment. The coming session will ratify  's appointment as party chief.
 
 The "steering committee" will meet on Saturday to finalise the venue and schedule of the AICC session which will draw delegates from across the states under the leadership of Rahul. As per the party constitution, Congress converts the   into a steering committee ahead of the AICC session where the new committee is constituted. It is to be seen if Rahul would restore elections to the top body.
 
 The CWC last saw elections in 1997 under Sitaram Kesri. Rahul has in the past given indications about restoring the elected body. The Congress statute provides for the election of 12 of the 25-member body while the rest are nominated.
 
 Sources said after the decision on venue and dates (likely to be Mohali or Delhi and to be held in March), the party will next week announce the drafting committee, the organising committee and sub-groups on political, economic and international affairs besides on agriculture. It shows that Congress plans to use the AICC session to kick off its election campaign by sharpening its attack on the Modi government.
 
 The 34-member steering committee announced on Friday comprises all the members of the old CWC though some "permanent invitees" have been dropped because of age or appointments elsewhere - like Amarinder Singh and  . The members of the "steering committee" include Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, A K Antony, Ahmed Patel, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Digvijaya Singh and Kamal Nath, among others.
