Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court, on Wednesday, adjourned the hearing on a plea by ousted leader of opposition (LOP) in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) Sanjay Mahakalkar, till Tuesday. The case was adjourned after a division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Rohit Deo heard senior counsel Subodh Dharmadhikari, who pleaded on behalf of Indian National Congress, and Maharashtra Pradesh Congress committee (MPCC). 

 He contended that a political party in municipal corporation would always be an affiliate of the original political party at the centre or state. He also questioned the mayor’s powers to recognize Tanaji Wanwe, even as Mahakalkar was unanimously elected by all corporators earlier. On Wednesday, senior counsel Sunil Manohar, appearing for Wanwe, had pointed out that Congress was registered as ‘NMC Congress Party’ and therefore, the recognition from high command didn’t apply in this case.
 
 On May 19, Wanwe replaced Mahakalkar, claiming support of 16 out of the 29 Congress corporators in NMC. Subsequently, divisional commissioner Anoop Kumar appointed Wanwe on the basis of number of corporators supporting him.
