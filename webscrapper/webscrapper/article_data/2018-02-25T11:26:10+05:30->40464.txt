PATNA: The simmering rift in the state unit of Congress came to the fore again on Saturday with former   (BPCC) president   blaming party’s Bihar affairs incharge C P Joshi for his exclusion from the party’s list of star campaigners for the byelection to Araria parliamentary seat and Jehanabad and Bhabhua assembly seats of the state on March 11.

 Congress’s list of its star campaigners, announced on Friday, includes Ghulam Nabi Azad, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Harish Rawat, Anand Sharma, Sheila Dixit and Ajay Maken. 
 
 Choudhary, who was the education minister in the state’s Grand Alliance (GA) government, said he got a letter from   (CLP) leader Sadanand Singh on Saturday, requesting him to campaign for the Congress-RJD alliance candidates in the bypolls in his individual capacity.
 
 “The CLP leader’s letter shows that even he believes that the selection of star campaigners is flawed,” Choudhary told TOI and added most “star campaigners” were not even well known among voters and, as such, campaigning by them would not help the party’s prospects.
 
 “Most star campaigners have either not contested any election or forfeited their deposits, if contested,” Choudhary said and described them as “insignificant netas”.
 
 Choudhary, who was charged with attempting a split in his own party following the fall of GA government in the state in July last year, said Joshi was out to humiliate him. “I was the most effective BPCC president, but Joshi has been hatching conspiracies against me,” he said.
 
 Congress won 27 of the 40 seats it fought as a GA partner in the 2015 assembly election with Choudhary helming the BPCC. His four-year tenure as BPCC chief ended when he was unceremoniously removed from the post in September last year amid reports of his opposition to the party’s alliance with tainted Lalu Prasad’s RJD.
