MHOW: Additional Director General of Police   visited the disputed   of   in Dhar on Sunday. DIG (rural)   also accompanied him. His visit to the site was important as Vasant Panchmi celebrations are scheduled to be organised on Wednesday.

 Sharma reached the office of Dhar SP Virendra Singh on Sunday morning. Sharma held a meeting of police and administrative officials in the wake of the upcoming festival of   to be held on Wednesday. He reviewed the law and order situation and issued necessary directions to local police.
 
 After that, he visited Bhojshala and inspected all the points where disputes occur between two communities.
 
 Usually, the administration and government are always alert and remain on their toes till Vasant Panchami is over. The reason being a fear of communal clashes.
 
 According to Dhar’s history, there has always been a sense of communal tension every year on the eve of Vasant Panchami. This is because the larger community here claims that a particular structure in the area is a Hindu temple while another minority community claims it is a mosque.
 
 This has led to communal clashes between the two groups of the town. Every year, heavy police force is deployed ahead of the festival’s celebrations.
