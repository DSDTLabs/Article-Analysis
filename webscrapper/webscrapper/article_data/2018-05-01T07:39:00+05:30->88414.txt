CHANDIGARH: Opposition leader   of the   (AAP) accused   leaders of indulging in   and collecting monthly ‘goonda tax’ from those running the mining mafia in Punjab. 

 Releasing a sting operation against Shahkot halqa (constituency) in-charge   alias Laddi Sherowali, Khaira said it indicated the nexus between Congress leaders and the mining mafia.
 
 Khaira said Laddi was seen demanding monthly ‘goonda tax’ from mining mafia representatives, who approached him to help carry out illegitimate operations from a ‘khud’ (mining pit) in Shahkot area. He said Laddi also mentioned the name of Khadur Sahib MLA Ramanjit Singh Sikki, his associate.
 
 According to him, it was well known that Laddi and MLA Sikki were part of former minister Rana Gurjeet Singh’s gang, which was notorious for illegal mining operations. He said the conversation recorded in the sting operation showed that the “so called strict orders of Captain Amarinder Singh” to stop illegal mining have fallen on deaf ears.
 
 Since the chief minister failed to take concrete action against powerful politicians involved in extracting minerals from six khuds of Nawanshahr, leaders like Laddi and Sikki have started indulging in illegal mining again.
