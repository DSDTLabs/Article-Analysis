NEW DELHI: Delhi   president   on Saturday wrote to the Union minister of housing and urban affairs   and Delhi chief minister  , seeking an appointment with them to provide a solution for the ongoing   in the capital.

 “I can say with confidence that to save Delhi from the sealing drive, many amendments had been made in the Master Plan 2021 and according to the amended Master Plan and the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second Act, 2011, no sealing can be carried out in Delhi,” said Maken, in his letter to Puri and Kejriwal.
 
 Maken, who has been a Union minister for housing and urban affairs in the past, said that it was very sad, the way in which the Centre and Delhi government were handling the sealing issue.
 
 He further said that the situation in Delhi could worsen if the sealing issue was not tackled sensibly in the coming days. “Because of the sealing, not only have the lives of traders and shopkeepers been ruined, but the poor people who work in these establishments are also on the verge of starvation,” added Maken.
