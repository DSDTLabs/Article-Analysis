BENGALURU: The   campus on   was abuzz on Saturday as 1,077 engineering and architecture students received provisional degree certificates. 

  Dr Yaj Medury, vice-chancellor of Bennett University, New Delhi, chief guest at the convocation ceremony, honoured 12 gold medallists. Two students bagged medals for overall best performance and best performance in Industrial Engineering Management (IEM) stream. 
 
  Delivering the convocation speech to 984 bachelors of engineering and 93 bachelors of architecture, Medury quoted former president Dr APJ Abdul Kalam: "All technological advancements we have today are the outcome of scientific exploration of scientists of earlier centuries. At no time, man was beaten by problems. He strives continuously to subjugate impossibility and t hen succeeds." 
 
  "In the past 60 years, India has made significant progress in all sectors, be it agriculture, industry, IT,   and knowledge wealth. Today, the Indian industry is not only growing in size but also in the level of operations, said Medury. 
 
  "Unless we strive to convert knowledge into practical innovations, we as a country will stand exposed to doing just basic research with little or no value. As entrepreneurship has boomed all across the world, the sector has seen systematic change. Much of the innovation we see today has come through organized activity, involving systematic efforts," he added.
