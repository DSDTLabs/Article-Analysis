CHENNAI: After more than a month of prelims and rigorous rehearsals, finalists of The   Thyagaraja Festival will go home with 1 lakh worth of prizes in all. But what is equally exciting is 23-year-old  , one of the five finalists, will perform at what he calls "  performances", The Music Academy, for the grand finale on January 20.

 "The fact that   invited performers representing both sabhas and music schools makes it unique," he says.
 
 In its seventh edition, the Times Thyagaraja Awards will have Vishwanath battling it out with other young talents - Madhumitha Doraiswamy, Prithvi Harish, Sidharth Prakash and Vishwesh Swaminadhan. The awards aim to identify and nurture amateur Carnatic music talent exhibited through the Margazhi season. Over the years, the competition has grown in scale, with nominations from more sabhas pouring in and concert venues getting bigger. This year, auditions were open to performers who had not been part of the sabhas as well, followed by five days of pre-final auditions that saw participants nominated by music sabhas around the world. The chosen ones performed to bag a place in the final.
