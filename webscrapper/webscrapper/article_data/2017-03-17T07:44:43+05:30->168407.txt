BHOPAL: Pleasantries exchanged between BJP and senior   leader   have raised many an eyebrow amid reports of rising dissent against Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi within the party, 

 The Madhya Pradesh BJP has thanked the Congress heavyweight for hailing Prime Minister  's political experience, and invited him to join the saffron brigade. It comes at a time when factionalism in the Pradesh Congress is at its peak. Congress secretary and Dewas MP Sajjan Verma recently wrote to Sonia Gandhi blaming some senior leaders for the plight of Congress in Madhya Pradesh.
 
 In a recent TV interview, Kamal Nath had admitted that Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is a novice in front of Modi. Nath had stated that Modi had a political experience of 42 years, while Rahul Gandhi took over as the party's vice-president a couple of years ago.
