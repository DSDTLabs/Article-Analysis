CHANDIGARH: The   MLA from Gurugram has alleged foul play in the routing of metro rail line at the behest of official machinery in the state days after Haryana chief minister   denied that the route had been realigned.

 “The government has not changed the route of the metro for the proposed global city project only to benefit a few. The officials concerned have manipulated by keeping the chief minister in dark. All this was done on October 14, 2016, during a meeting,” alleged the Gurugram legislator Umesh Aggarwal.
 
 He said under the transit-oriented development (TOD) policy, notified in February last year, those willing to get the change of land use (CLU) permission were given the deadline of six months. “But later in November, the officials had managed to get the deadline extended. Officials involved in this process purposely concealed this fact from the chief minister and his office ( ),” alleged Aggarwal.
 
 Earlier this month, the Haryana town and country planning (TCP) department realigned the route of the metro rail connecting Gurugram with Manesar. The changed route was through the proposed global city, an institutional zone planned by the government in its 2031 master plan.
 
 Consequently, areas falling under both sides of the metro routes had come under the ambit of mix land use clause. A spokesperson in the CMO said the issue has been resolved. “MLA Aggarwal spent an hour and a half with the CM on Saturday. He is convinced now,” the spokesperson said.
