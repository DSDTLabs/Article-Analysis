Manali: A 34-year-old man from Sikkim, who was residing in Parbati valley, was arrested by Kullu police on Tuesday night and 11kg charas was seized from his possession.

 This is third big catch this month by Kullu police under its special campaign against smugglers. The accused has been identified as Roshan Gurang of Lal Bazaar, Sikkim. 
 
 The peddler was nabbed after he tried to run away when told to stop by a police patrol team. He was coming on foot from Manikaran side and carrying 11kg charas in his bag.
 
 Kullu superintendent of police Padam Chand said, “He has been arrested under the NDPS Act. We shall now find source and destination of the consignment.” 
 
 Sources said that primary investigation revealed that he had brought charas from Nepal and wanted to sell it as ‘Malana cream’ to fetch better prices. 
 
 In a special campaign between August 22 and September 5 last year, police, panchayats, all government employees and several NGOs had destroyed about 1.25 lakh cannabis plants from 5,000 bigha land in Kullu. Still, there is no decline in charas production and its smuggling.
 
 Police believe that a large quantity of charas may have been brought from Nepal and other states to the district for further selling in the name of Kullu charas, especially ‘Malana cream’ that is considered best quality charas in the world and is expensive. According to sources, ‘Malana cream’ fetches over Rs 5 lakh/kg in the international market. Also, some cannabis is still being cultivated in Kullu with help of labourers from Nepal and Bihar. 
 
 While a Nigerian national was arrested by Kullu police from Delhi on February 13 with 1.5kg heroin, a US national was held with 126kg ganja and over 10 litre hash oil from near Naggar village of Kullu on February 17.
