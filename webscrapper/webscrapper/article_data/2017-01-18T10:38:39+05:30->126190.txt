Vadodara: Locals from   near   on   following   in less than 24 hours that claimed one life.

 Police said that 27-year-old man   was hit by an unidentified car on Monday night when he was crossing the road on his motorcycle. Eye witnesses said that Gamechi received severe injuries on his head and died immediately. On Tuesday noon too, a motorcycle was hit by another car in similar manner and two persons were injured. Locals rushed them to a nearby private hospital for treatment.
 
 Two accidents in less than 24 hours at the same spot, angered residents of Fajalpur village who came out on road and blocked both sides of the NH 8. A patrolling team from Chhani police station rushed to the spot to clear the highway, but the mob did not budge forcing cops to bring in more force. Long queues of cars and other heavy vehicles waited for hours on the highway for people to disperse.
 
 Police said that the place where the accidents happened does not have an opening but the locals had broken the divider and created an opening for their convenience. Since, there are no signboards of the illegal opening, several accidents have taken place there, a police official said. The crowd got dispersed after the police promised them to bring an amicable solution after discussion.
 
 “We had a meeting with the highway contractor and sarpanch of Fajalpur. It has been decided that the contractor will create a by-pass road upto an opening that exists 400 metres away in 10 days for the villagers,” said assistant commissioner of police, A Division, J M Chavda.
