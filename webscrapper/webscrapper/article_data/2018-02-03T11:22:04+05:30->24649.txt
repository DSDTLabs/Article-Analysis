MOHALI: Led by the  , residents of 14   villages where Punjab Land Preservation Act ( ) has been renotified, staged a protest outside Mohali administrative complex here on Friday, saying that the state government reinforced the law without following court directions.

 In a statement issued here,   Punjab vice-president   and party secretary Vineet Joshi said the high court had directed the state government to renotify PLPA after scientific evaluation to ascertain if soil erosion was taking place and water table was falling in the area. “Also, if soil erosion is taking place and water table is falling, the government should be convinced that implementing the ban under PLPA will stabilize ecology in the area. Proper legal procedure should be followed as prescribed under Section 7 of the PLPA. However, forest department officials are misleading the poor and illiterate landowners and adopting a procedure not legally tenable,” they said.
 
 The villagers demanded that a fresh notification be issued after adopting proper procedure and mandatory provisions of the Punjab Land Preservation Act and the directions issued by the high court on February 8, 2017.
 
 The protesting villagers said the forest department was trying to illegally enforce the PLPA in Siswan, Choti and Badi Naggal, Majra, Pallanpur, Dhulwan, Majrian, Sanyuk, Tarapur, Mirzapur, Gaucher, Burwana, Nada and Pachchad villages, in “sheer disregard” of court orders.
