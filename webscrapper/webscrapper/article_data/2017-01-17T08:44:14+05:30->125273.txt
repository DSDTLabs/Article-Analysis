BENGALURU: Although elections to the agricultural produce market committee ( ) are not fought on party symbols, both the   and   are claiming that candidates they backed have won the polls.

 After the results were declared on Saturday, leaders of both the parties said that many candidates they had supported had triumphed in the APMC elections. While the BJP said that it had captured 48 of the 132 APMCs that went to polls on January 12, the Congress said it bagged 52. As many as 1,712 candidates were elected to the APMCs across the state.
 
 Chief minister   said, “It clearly indicates that the government’s welfare schemes are being appreciated by the electorate.”
 
 Karnataka BJP president and former CM   dubbed the results a referendum on the Congress’s rule in the state. “Despite being in power, the Congress managed to win just 52 APMCs,” he said.
 
 However, senior JD(S) leaders have remained silent since the announcement of the results, with reports suggesting that candidates backed by the party fared poorly in the  . But political commentators and a few leaders said that neither BJP nor the Congress would gain from the results.
 
 Political analyst Harish Ramaswamy pointed out that the institution of APMC had lost its significance. “The results of the APMC elections are of little consequence. This is largely because farmers are directly selling their produce to the companies, diminishing the significance of the APMCs,” Ramaswamy added.
 
 JD(S) leader YSV Datta said that the results of APMC polls would have no bearing on the bypolls or the 2018 assembly elections. “Those with money are the big winners at the APMC polls. Also, caste plays an important role. Parties definitely are not the winners,” Datta said.
 
 He substantiated his remarks by citing the results of the APMC polls that were held during SM Krishna’s tenure as CM. “Even after winning 90% of the seats in the APMC and other local body elections, the Congress lost badly in the assembly polls,” Datta added.
