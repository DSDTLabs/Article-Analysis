NOIDA: A 27-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide on Sunday evening after a break-up with her live-in partner and due to financial stress.

 Police said the woman lost her job and shifted to the locality in Sector 12 nearly a month ago.
 
 “She was depressed due to financial stress. She used to work in a call centre in   earlier but lost her job recently. She tried to kill herself twice earlier,” Vinay Prakash, SHO of Sector 24 police station said.
 
 The police said they recovered an old suicide note from the room in which the woman said she was ending her life at her will and nobody should be troubled after her death.
 
 “The neighbours gathered and her landlord who was not staying in the house was called to the spot. Her family was informed and her mother and brother came,” one of the neighbours told TOI. “The child was staying with her maternal grandparents. The woman had not told her flatmate that she had been married,” said a neighbour.
 
 According to the neighbours, the woman’s brother said she was in distress after a tiff with her boyfriend, with whom she was in a live-in relationship.
