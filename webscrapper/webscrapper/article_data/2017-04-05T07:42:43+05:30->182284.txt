HYDERABAD: Shaken by the death of their son, Vadithya Srinivas, 30, in the custody of police in Saudi Arabia, his parents are demanding an investigation. 

 Srinivas was found hanging in the Al   police station in Riyadh on February 27. He was arrested by the police in a traffic violation case and detained in the police station.
 
 A relative of Srinivas informed the family in   of Pargi mandal in Vikarabad district about Srinivas' death. The body is expected to be brought to Hyderabad on April 5.
 
 "I know my brother's nature very well. He was not the type to commit suicide. I suspect foul play," Srinivas' elder brother Venkatesh told TOI on Tuesday. He said his brother's mobile and wallet were missing from the police station.
 
 Venkatesh too had worked in Riyadh for some years and had come back because of his health condition. Venkatesh contacted some friends in   area where Srinivas lived and got them to lodge a complaint in the very same police station about the custodial death. "The police station has not yet reacted to our complaint," he said. Venkatesh also met Vikarabad district collector D Vidya on Monday and handed over a petition on behalf of his father Vadithya Govind urging her to take up with Saudi authorities about the need for investigation into the custodial death of his brother.
 
 "We feel that he died under suspicious circumstances in police custody in Saudi Arabia. It should be thoroughly investigated to find out the reasons behind the death," Govind said. He asked the collector to request the ministry of external affairs and the   in Riyadh to take up the issue. 
 
 "Since he was in police custody, the police are answerable for his death. I know how a police station looks like in Riyadh. There can be no way a person can hang himself in the police station," Venkatesh said. A forensic report mentioned the cause of death as 'cardiac and respiration arrest as a result of suffocation by hanging'.
