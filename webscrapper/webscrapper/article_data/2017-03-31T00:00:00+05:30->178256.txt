The cast of Neeraj Madhav-starrer   is getting more interesting by the day. 

 The latest we got to know is that   of Nee-na fame has an important role in the movie. Deepti confirms the news to us. “Yes, I’m part of the movie, and will start shoot of my portions in April.” However, her character cannot be revealed as it has suspense elements involved, she says. “All I can say is that it is a very interesting character which has different shades to it. I was hooked right from the start which is why I took up the film,” says Deepti. “I can’t even disclose the name of my character. She is a very ‘today’s girl’, and she is not placed opposite anyone. She stands independent, which is another interesting aspect. But I can say she is not at all a typical Malayali girl. I wish I get a chance to play such a girl soon.”
 
 Lavakusha is a ‘spy thriller comedy drama’ and stars Aju Varghese and   and is also the latter’s first script. Directed by Gireesh Mano of Nee Ko Njaa Cha-fame, the film also has friendship as a major theme. Biju Menon has an important role in the movie too.
 
 “It is the first time I’m acting in a comedy and I’m all excited,” Deepti says, adding that she has a Mammootty movie coming up. She is also in talks for a few Telugu movies but will take them up only after Lavakusha is over.
