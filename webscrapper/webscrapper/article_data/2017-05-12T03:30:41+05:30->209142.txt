NEW DELHI: The home ministry has issued directions to   to disclose details of their immovable property, failing which they would be denied   and other service benefits. Sources said the number of officers declaring their assets had gone up considerably in the last few years.

 In a recent communication, the   asked chief secretaries, directors general of police and the chiefs of central police organisations to seek an explanation from   officers who had not yet filed immovable property returns ( ) for 2016.
 
 The last date to file IPR for 2016 online was January 31, 2017.
 
 The government has directed IPS officers to submit their details immediately, as not doing so will invite denial of vigilance clearance, which will ultimately block their promotion. Ahome ministry official said around 15% of the existing strength of 3,894 IPS officers had not filed their IPR so far. The ministry is the cadre-controlling authority of the IPS.
 
 Earlier, only 30 to 40% of the IPS officers used to declare their assets. “There are strict rules now, so many are coming forward to declare their assets,” said a ministry official.
