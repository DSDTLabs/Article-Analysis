 On November 23 last year, Richo had filed a writ petition in the high court challenging the validity of 43 Indian   (INC) MLAs who merged with PPA. The court had then issued a notice for consideration on the interim relief for stay on the speaker's order by which all the MLAs have been shown as PPA members and the bulletin dated issued by the secretary of the legislative assembly notifying them as PPA members.
