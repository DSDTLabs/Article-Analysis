Namish Taneja’s real-life love story is more romantic than the daily soaps he has acted in. The actor, last seen in ' ', has finally opened up about matters of the heart. He has been dating  , who is currently studying to be a company secretary, for the past six years.

 Namish tells us, “I had gone to a restaurant where I saw Aanchal and instantly fell in love with her. It might sound filmy, but when I saw her leaving the restaurant, I went up to her and asked her if she’s on any social networking site. She got baffled and said no. I then requested her to share her number with me. Though she tried to give me a wrong number, she is so innocent that she ended up giving the right one. A few days later, I started sending messages to her and after a lot of struggle, I managed to convince her for a meeting. We gradually became friends and a year later, I told her that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. Fortunately, she accepted my proposal."
 
 It’s Aanchal’s innocence that attracted Namish the most. “Initially, it was just an infatuation, but then I fell in love with her childlike innocence and simplicity,” he says. 
 
 Ask him about the reason for hiding the relationship for so long and he says, “Aanchal is not from the entertainment industry and was pursuing graduation. I didn’t want to create unnecessary trouble for her by making our relationship public — it might hamper her studies. I am a protective boyfriend and I don’t want to make her personal life hell just because she is dating an actor.”
 
 Though madly in love with each other, the two haven’t thought of settling down anytime soon. “Marriage is not on the cards. We want to settle professionally first and then plan other things,” he signs off.
