NASHIK: The Currency Note Press ( ) in   has increased the printing of legal tenders by about 40% and dispatched 80 million pieces in the denomination of Rs 500 to RBI during the last fortnight. 

 The CNP, a unit of the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Ltd (SMPCIL), is printing 14 million pieces a day as against 10 million, following the shortage of cash in different parts of the country. "The press is currently printing eight million pieces of Rs   and six million pieces of Rs 50," sources in the CNP said on Wednesday.
 
 "The CNP is presently operating on government holidays and Sundays. For instance, the press was functioning even on Maharashtra Day on May 1," said the sources.
 
 The daily production at CNP had declined from 18 million pieces a day to 10 million pieces since April 1. It was increased to 14 million pieces a day following instructions from the authorities concerned 
 
 "The press will further enhance the printing to 18 to 20 million pieces a day in a couple of weeks," added the sources.
 
 At present, the CNP, Nashik is printing currency notes in the denominations of Rs 50 and Rs 500 only.
 
 The press had stopped printing of Rs 500 notes from November last year to mid-April this year because it did not receive fresh orders from RBI. It has also stopped printing Rs 100 and Rs 20 notes since April 1 as it is still awaiting the new design for them from RBI.
 
 The CNP in Nashik has stopped printing Rs 200 notes since April 1 because RBI placed the order with CNP in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh.
 
 "The printing of notes in the denomination of Rs 500 was started in the middle of April this year and it took over a week to complete all the printing stages to make the note ready for circulation," said the CNP sources.
 
 The daily printing of Rs 500 notes has reached the eight million pieces per day mark and it is expected to be increased up to 12 million pieces a day in the next few days.
