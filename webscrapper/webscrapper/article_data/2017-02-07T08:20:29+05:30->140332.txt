INDORE: Packaged milk sold by   under the Sanchi brand will be costly by Rs 2 per litre. The hike will be effective from Tuesday. Other four milk unions in the state - Bhopal, Ujjain, Gwalior and Jabalpur -- are likely to follow.

 S L Karan, chief executive officer, Indore milk union said, “We have decided to increase the prices of milk by Rs 2 per litre from February 6. The hike has been necessitated in wake of increase in production to transportation cost. We have received a letter from our head office and it was decided to hike the prices.” Hike will be across all variants of milk sold under the brand, he said.
 
 Managing director of   Aruna Gupta told TOI, “The federation has recommended a hike in prices of packaged milk marketed by it as Sanchi brand by two rupees per litre across the state.” The hike has been recommended due increase in production cost and all the five milk unions in the state have been asked to effect the hike after approvals from their respective board, she said.
 
 Benefit of increased prices will be passed on to farmers to compensate the loss from increased fodder prices, Gupta said.
 
 Cost of cattle fodder has risen by about 50% this year to Rs 3,000 per quintal compared with last year in the same period, according to the milk distributors association of Indore.
 
 Indore Cooperative Dudgh Sangh collects about 290 lakh litres of milk per day from Indore and nearby areas. Madhya Pradesh ranks fourth in terms of production in the country. According to Karan, “About 250 lakh litres of milk is supplied per day in 9 districts of Indore and around 40 lakh liters of milk is converted into milk products such as ghee, cheese, curd and other related products.” 
 
 Earlier on February 1, retail milk sellers in the city (Indore Dudgh Vikreta Sangh) also hiked prices of milk by Rs 2 per litre to Rs 43 per litre, citing lower milk production and increased rearing cost.
