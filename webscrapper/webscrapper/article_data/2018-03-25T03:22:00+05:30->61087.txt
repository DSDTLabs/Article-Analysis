Panaji: A day after the United Porvorim Citizens Forum (UPCF) raised concerns over the manner in which roads were being widened in Socorro, Porvorim, elected representatives affiliated to local MLA Rohan Khaunte refuted the allegations. 

 Porvorim Rising, an organisation with ties to Khaunte, on Saturday said the UPCF wanted to hinder road-widening due to vested interests.
 
 “The UPCF are extortionists. They are applying for land conversion. They are just a land grabbing cartel,” Porvorim Rising convener Suraj Borkar, said. 
 
 On Friday, the UPCF had hinted that Khaunte was conniving with land developers by allowing a hill to be cut for road-widening, which would facilitate the construction of larger housing structures. The forum had warned that if the   and tree-felling continued, it would file a writ petition.
 
 Socorro sarpanch Sandeep Vazarkar said that all permissions to widen the road and cut the hill were taken. tnn
