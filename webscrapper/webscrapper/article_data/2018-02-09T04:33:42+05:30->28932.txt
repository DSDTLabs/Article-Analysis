MUMBAI: A Thane policeman and a former   personnel were booked under the stringent Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act on Wednesday for travelling illegally in a railway coach reserved for the handicapped. 

 The complainant, Sagar Bornare (29), who is polio afflicted and employed with  's IT department, claimed the duo twisted his arm when he started clicking their photographs on his cellphone as evidence. 
 
 Bornare, who had pressed similar charges against an RPF officer last year, said security force personnel must follow the law themselves too.
 
 Bornare said at 9.17am, when he boarded a CSMT-bound train from Thane station he spotted two able-bodied men near the door of the handicapped coach. When he asked them about their disability, they started arguing with him. "I tweeted about the two illegal travellers and tagged railway officials," Bornare told TOI. "As I was texting a complaint to a   RPF officer, one of the men, Samir Pathan, read the text over my shoulder. He claimed he was an RPF official and no action would be taken against them." As Bornare started to click their photographs for evidence, the men allegedly twisted his arm and damaged his phone. "Fortunately, I did not lose my balance and fall off the train. I then took a seat." 
 
 At Ghatkopar, an RPF team took Samir and Saifan Pathan into custody. "Samir is with Thane rural police, while Saifan was with the CISF before he took voluntary retirement. Both were travelling ticketless. We sent them to Kurla GRP outpost where they were booked under the RPWD Act," said an official. "We have sent them notices asking them to appear before court. Arresting public servants requires prosecutorial sanction," said Kurla GRP inspector Mahesh Balwantrao. If found guilty, they could face up to two years in jail, or up to Rs 1 lakh fine or both.
