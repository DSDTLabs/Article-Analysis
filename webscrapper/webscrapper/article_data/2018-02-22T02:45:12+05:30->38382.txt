 - turned-fashion designer   said it is not possible to go on a tour like the much-talked about   one and also take care of her four children at the same time.

 
  
 Speaking on Spice Girls tour or new album, she said, "For us,   is a strong powerful message. We want to protect the legacy and how do we pass that message on to future generations?"
 
 "We never said that was about touring or about creating new  , or even about the five of us together. I love spending time with the girls and we all feel the same about passing that positive message on. Never has it been more relevant and needed than now."
 
 "It's not possible to go on tour and do that, I'll tell you that much. When you are a working mum, my schedule has to be really looked after to make sure I can spin all these plates," she added.
