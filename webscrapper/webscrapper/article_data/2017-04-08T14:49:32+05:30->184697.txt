NEW DELHI: After  , private Indian carriers have also allowed   MP   to fly with them. 

 “Consequent to
  after being satisfied with the statement given by the MP, the FIA (Federation of  ) member airlines are also restoring the flying privileges to Gaikwad under the assurance that our assets and colleagues shall be accorded the respect that they deserve for the hard work they put in every day,” said FIA’s associate director Ujjwal Dey.
 
 FIA — comprising of IndiGo, Jet, SpiceJet and GoAir — and Tata Group airlines — Vistara and AirAsia India — had on March 24 barred Gaikwad from their flights. The unprecedented step was taken after Gaikwad beat up a 60-year-old Air India officer with sandals and tried to throw him off an aircraft at Delhi Airport. AI was the first to banish the MP from its flights, followed by the private airlines.
 
 Since March 24, 
  with AI and private airlines but each time, found his ticket cancelled. Then after a two-week-ban, the government had on Friday directed an unwilling Air India and private airlines to lift the restriction from the MP. While AI complied with the order on Friday itself, others have followed suit now.
 
 The aviation ministry issued a terse order to airlines following the “
  ” by the MP and the “undertaking of good conduct given by him”. 
 
 The ministry is working on a national no fly list “to deal with unruly passengers in a more efficient manner in future.” A draft is likely to be issued early next week, seeking public comments.
