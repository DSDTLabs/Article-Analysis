KOLHAPUR: Driving without wearing a helmet on   will come with a price.

 The Kolhapur police will start a drive against helmet-less driving on the national highways passing through   covering Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Solapur and Pune rural districts.
 
 Special inspector general, Kolhapur Range,   said they had launched a campaign for the past six months to spread awareness among bikers to follow traffic rules and drive safely to reduce road accidents.
 
 “From the first week of April, we launched a drive to collect fine from those who do not follow traffic rules. Now, we will initiate the drive to ensure that bikers use helmets while driving on national highways passing through Kolhapur Range,” he said. 
 
 Out of total fatalities on the roads, maximum deaths are of those who drive motorcycles. “Our aim is to ensure that accidents do not take place and if they do happen, the fatalities are reduced. Keeping this in view, we will make helmet compulsory for the motorists on national highways. After this, we will launch a similar drive in cities and towns in Kolhapur Range,” he said.
 
 The officer said they were planning to launch a drive to conduct surprise checks on drunk driving on national highways. “We suspect that truck drivers and other motorists consume alcohol and take  , that lead to road accidents,” he said.
