Coimbatore: With sugar production falling by 18.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 16.25 million tonnes (mt) between October and February, sugar prices have hit a new high of Rs 37,000 per tonne at the end of February. Sugar prices touched a life time high of Rs 3,950 per quintal on NCDEX twice last week. Prices would remain high given the tight supply situation, experts tracking the sector said.

 The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) had lowered its estimates for sugar production during the 2016-17 season (October-September) to 21.3 mt in January due to drought in key cane growing states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka. ISMA projected sugar production at 23.4 mt for 2016-17 during its first advance estimates of the crop in September last year
 
 Sugar production is estimated to have declined 11% y-o-y to 25.2 mt in the 2015-16 season. An opening stock of around 7.6 mt would result in the overall sugar availability of about 29 mt during the 2016-17 season, which would be able to meet the domestic demand of around 25 mt, analysts said. This would result in carryover stocks remaining in the tight range of 4.6-4.8 mt when the new sugar crushing season commences in November this year, they said.
 
 “Due to tight carryover stocks the country may need to import sugar later in the season to meet demand until cane crushing gathers pace by December,” said Ritesh Kumar Sahu, analyst, agri commodities, Angel Broking.
 
 “Thus, we expect the price to touch Rs 4,000 per quintal in futures market during the current season as the crushing season comes to end in Maharashtra and Karnataka early,” he said. Ratings agency ICRA said that it expects sugar prices in the domestic market to remain firm in the near term, given the deficit situation in the country and international markets.
 
 “Sugar prices are likely to remain firm over the next two to three quarters,” said Sabyasachi Majumdar, head, corporate ratings, ICRA. “Further, with the crushing season drawing to a close in both Maharashtra and Karnataka and both reporting a lower-than-expected output the possibility of the actual output for SY (sugar year) 2017 falling even below the government’s estimates cannot be ruled out,” he stated.
 
 Expectations of a decline in output have been driving up sugar prices, which have increased from around Rs 31,500 per tonne in March 2016 to Rs 36,000 per tonne in October 2016. Prices dropped marginally following the demonetisation exercise to around Rs 35,000-35,500 per tonne in November and December. With projections of further fall in domestic production, sugar prices firmed up to to Rs 36,700 per tonne in January.
