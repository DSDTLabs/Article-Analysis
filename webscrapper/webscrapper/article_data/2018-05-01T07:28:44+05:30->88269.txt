CHANDRAPUR: State vice-president of Congress and deputy leader in the state Assembly, MLA  , has strongly opposed the government’s decision to allocate water from   dam to two thermal power stations coming up in Umred tehsil in Nagpur district. He has warned of strong agitation if the government goes ahead with the decision to allocate the waters meant for irrigation and drinking propose.

 According to Wadettiwar, each of the two thermal power plants being set up by Mahagenco at Gokul and Piraya villages would generate 800MW power. These plants will require 28 million metric cube (MMC) water every year. The MLA claimed that as per government’s proposal, 13 MMC water will provided to these thermal power plants from Gosikhurd project, while the remaining 15 MMC will come from Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s water treatment project at Bhandewadi. 
 
 He has claimed that a proposal to this effect is ready. If the decision is executed, it will destroy the lives of farmers and would force them to take to the streets. 
 
 Wadettiwar maintained that Gosikhurd is boon for farmers of east Vidarbha. “Over 2.50 lakh hectares of agricultural land in Chandrapur, Bhandara and Nagpur districts is going to be irrigated and farmers have the first right over its waters. At a time when farmers are facing agrarian crises, providing irrigation water for power generation is sheer injustice,” he said.
