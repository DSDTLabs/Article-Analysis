Shurhozelie Liezietsu (81), chief minister of   since February 22, speaks to Oinam Sunil on the fast improving ties between his state and Manipur. Excerpts:

 
 
 I went there to pay my respect to Biren Singh and the people of Manipur. We welcome the political change there.
 
 
 
 Earlier, some selfish politicians exploited the situation. The last   CM of Manipur spread lies. We have many many ethnic groups in the Northeast and we must learn to live together. Biren Singh is large-hearted and travelled to tribal areas as soon as he took charge as CM.Such a move can remove all doubts and misgivings.
 
 
 
 There is no need to quarrel over the issue. We consider ourselves as one family but the British di vided us. Maybe, they did so for administra tive reasons.
 
 That is why we are spread over different districts. We can resolve this matter through dialogue.
 
 
 
 Naga People's Front hasn't set any terms for its support to Manipur's   government. It will be there with Biren Singh till the end. UNC talks will not have any impact on our relations. He is trying to bridge the gap between Meiteis and Nagas as well as among other ethnic groups.
 
 
 
 We are natural allies.
