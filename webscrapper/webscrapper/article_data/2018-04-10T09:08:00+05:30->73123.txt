 Collector Nishant Warwade said that the state government has constituted a committee to make changes, if required, in the murals at Ambedkar’s birth place.
 
 Some two years ago, 40 murals depicting Ambedkar’s life were painted in Mhow. The local organisations had raised objections that Dr Ambedkar’s face was not in right shape in those murals. “Taking the cognizance, the state government has constituted a committee led by the minister Lal Singh Arya to look into the matter. Artists of international level will be roped in to restore the murals,” Warwade said.
