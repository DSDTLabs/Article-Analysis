NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday decided to examine a plea of   seeking its direction to make   by making   (VVPAT) mandatory in   (EVMs) to ensure transparency in elections.

 A bench headed by Justice J Chelameswar asked the centre and the commission to file their response by May 8 on allegations leveled by BSP that EVM could be manipulated and paper trail must be introduced.
 
 BSP's legal battle in SC on EVMs also got support from political parties as Congress, NCP and Trinimool Congress
 told the apex court that they would also file petition on the issue.
 
 The apex court had way back in 2013 directed VVPAT must be introduce in EVMs to strengthen voters' confidance in election process.
 
 It has even recently asked the government to tell a time frame when VVPAT would be implemented across the country
 
 In the VVPAT system, when a voter presses the button for a candidate of his choice in the EVM, a paper ballot containing the serial number, name of the candidate and poll symbol would be printed for the voter.
 
 The VVPAT is intended as an independent verification system for voting machines designed to allow voters to verify that their votes were cast correctly, to detect possible election fraud or malfunction and to provide a means to audit the stored electronic results.
