Coimbatore: The city corporation officials penalised a local contractor of public toilets at VOC Park in the city for overcharging users. The contractor, R Krishnan was asked to pay a fine of Rs 15,000 and was warned that the contract will be terminated if a similar complaint was raised against him again. 

 Corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan said that the officials inspected the toilet and since the contractor was violating the norms, he was penalized. 
 
 As per Mahesh, assistant revenue officer, central zone, the contractor had taken up various corporation projects for the past 15 years and he was given this contract for the past one year. “When we inspected the toilets, we found that instead of charging Re1, he was charging Rs5. The board with the rates which is supposed to be placed outside the toilet was also kept hidden. He was not issuing tokens as well. So we fined him and warned him,” said Mahesh. 
 
 He added that this financial year, nearly seven contractors were fined in the central zone and Rs1.50 lakh was collected as penalty from them.
