Country singer and actress   says she will not stop taking her daughter to zoos and aquariums just because some fans don't like it. The 'Whiskey' singer was targeted earlier this week when she posted pictures of herself and her 13-month-old daughter Jolie visiting Discovery Cove in Orlando, Florida and swimming with dolphins. 

  
  
 Followers and fans accused her of being insensitive to the happiness of animals by visiting the   park, prompting   to take the photos down. 
 
 She later reposted them on Instagram and told her haters, "I had an incredible day at @discoverycove... and I learned so much about each one (of the dolphins), met the trainers, and I asked very specific questions as to how they were being taken care of." 
 
 
  
 Singer said she wasn't going to let critics ruin her daughter's upbringing. "I understand people have their beliefs about dolphins in captivity and all that, but she (daughter) was being a fussy girl and I wanted to just take her out and see some dolphins...," she said. 
 
 "I was raised on going to aquariums and zoos and I want her to see those things."
