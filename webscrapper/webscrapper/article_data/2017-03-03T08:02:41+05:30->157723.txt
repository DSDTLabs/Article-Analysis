LUCKNOW: Even after seven decades of independence, over 25,000 villagers in the Bairia seat of Ballia continue to wait for electricity. The four villages of   gram panchayat namely Bhuwal Chapra, Nauranga, Chakki Nauranga and   survive on a batteryoperated bulb and a small fan in their homes.

 Pankaj Pandey, a villager, says, “Our children study in a battery-operated low voltage bulb. No political party has ever understood our plight. After 7pm, there is no light on roads and the village goes off to sleep early. Most of us earn livelihood through agriculture but a few have opened shops of daily use items. Even they cannot operate shops after 7 pm as it is too dark.“
 
 The villagers have to walk up to 3km to reach the river bank and take a boat to cross the Ganga. From the left bank, they have to again walk till 3 km to reach   village of Ballia to get at least a road.
 
 Surendra Thakur, a local says, “There are no roads for us. We daily walk up to 4-5 km on kuchha roads to get a boat on the Ganga. The government promised a bridge in 1999 across the river but it has not been built till date.“
 
 Locals claim that a few months ago, Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari had promised to build a bridge on the Ganga but no construction has started yet.
