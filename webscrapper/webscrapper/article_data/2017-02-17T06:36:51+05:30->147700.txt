PONDA: For the second time in this academic year, students of  , Dhaushirem-Usgao, boycotted classes and drew the attention of the   (DoE). Over 200 students, supported by their disgruntled parents, boycotted classes, which are presently held in a private residential flat at Kelini-Usgao, since the beginning of this academic year in June 2016.

 Pran Gaude, chairman of the school parent teachers’ association, alleged that the temporary premise doesn’t have proper ventilation and students couldn’t concentrate on studies due to soaring temperatures in the make-shift classrooms.
 
 In a similar incident on June 16, 2016, students had boycotted classes citing the same reason and director of education Gajanan Bhat had assured them that the classrooms would be ready in two months. Six months since, the project isn’t ready, and this led the students to boycott classes again on Thursday.
 
 The directorate has now assured parents that at least two classrooms in the school building will be made available in a week’s time.
 
 “The school building is under renovation and I have asked the   to make at least two classrooms ready in a week,” Bhat told TOI.
