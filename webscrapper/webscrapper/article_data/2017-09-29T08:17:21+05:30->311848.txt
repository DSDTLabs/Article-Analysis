PANAJI: Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) on Friday ordered closure notice to nine food vendors operating kiosks at the   market in Salcete without FDA licence.

 “They have been ordered to shutdown until further orders, as they did not have food safety licence,” said director FDA Saleem  . The inspection was carried out following complaints by Raia residents about the illegal operations by some vendors. 
 
 The FDA team has collected samples of a variety of biscuits and toasts being sold by the vendors for quality checking, Veljee said.
