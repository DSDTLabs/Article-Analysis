PATNA: Rising temperature not only affects human beings, but also has an adverse impact on their pets. Health experts in the state capital suggest that Patnaites should take care of their   during the summer season as their health is also at risk.

 “Pets can suffer from dehydration and in many cases, exposure to high temperature can prove fatal. A dog pants and loses water from its body more than any other pet. One should, therefore, give ORS properly mixed with clean water to dogs on a regular basis. Leaving them behind in locked vehicles is equally dangerous,”   and Production’s senior research officer Dr   said on Monday, adding dogs and cats should be taken out for a walk early in the morning.
 
 Veterinarians are of the view that pets often lose their appetite during the summer season. According to Dr Ajeet, “Avoid feeding your furry friends in the afternoon as the food is likely to get wasted. Serve them food either early in the morning or late in the evening.”
 
 Patnaites have also geared up to protect their pets from falling ill during the summer season. “I keep my dog Romeo indoors at this time of the year. I also keep a bowl of fresh and clean water outside the house or on the terrace so that he can drink it whenever he is thirsty. I visit the vet and get his hair pruned so that he does not feel hot,” said homemaker Sonam Kumar, who lives in Kankarbagh Colony.
 
 Animal lover Rohit Srivastava brushes his dog Bella’s coat to beat the heat and takes her out for a walk early in the morning and late in the evening. “Pets attract fleas and ticks in the summer season which can lead to different illnesses. One must make it a point to brush one’s pet’s coat thoroughly,” the Nehru Nagar resident told TOI.
