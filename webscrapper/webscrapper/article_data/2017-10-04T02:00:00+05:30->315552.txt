PATNA: A large number of students of private engineering institutes in the state on Tuesday demonstrated outside the residence of science and technology minister Jai Kumar Singh against the delay in publication of their results.

 Faculty members of certain engineering colleges, including Netaji Subhash Institute of Technology, also joined the agitators who demanded declaration of the first and second semester results of the 2016-20 BTech batch by October 5.
 
 The students also referred to a Patna high court directive on September 13 on a petition of the Bihar Private Technical and Professional Institutions Association. “The court of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyaya directed   to declare the results within three weeks,” said one student.
 
 But the results have not been declared yet. “Our future is at stake,” said Sanjana Kumari, a student of electronic engineering in a private college. She also blamed science and technology department officials for the raw deal to the 1,300 and odd engineering students. 
 
 Mechanical engineering student Vishal Kumar said they wrote the second semester test in July whereas the first semester test was held in January. “If they further delay our results, how can we concentrate on our studies for the next term?” he asked.
 
 An NSIT faculty member rued that the delay was adding to the anxiety among students.
 
 When contacted, minister Singh said he would look into the matter and find a solution to the problem of students.
