BENGALURU: If cab rides are more expensive now, it's because app-based aggregators like Ola and Uber are implementing the new structure announced by the   in January and revised in March. 

  "On Tuesday, Ola gave an undertaking it has implemented the new fares. Uber is expected to give it in writing in a day or two," said transport commissioner B Dayananda. 
 
 The implementation of the new fare structure was delayed since there were minor changes in the January 9 notification. "A revised notification, issued on March 3, will be implemented. All cab aggregators have to follow it," the commissioner added.
