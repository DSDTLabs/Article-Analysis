LUCKNOW: In what would be a big relief to working women and housewives,   has decided to construct breastfeeding centres across the city. The centres will be built near 'pink toilets' (for women) in all major markets and public places. 

 Mayor   has directed LMC officials to conduct a survey and scout for spare land for the facility.
 
  Since LMC team is already looking for land for pink toilets, the mayor has directed them to explore the possibility of opening a breast feeding centre nearby. 
 
 Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia told TOI, "Nowadays, most mothers go out for job, shopping and other work. In many instances, they have a newborn to take care of and whom they cannot leave at home. They need to feed them while being out. The centres will provide them the convenience to feed their babies in privacy." 
 
 Health data also shows that there is a need to promote breastfeeding in the state, especially in urban areas. 
 
 As per the most recent National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4), in UP, 21.5% children in urban areas were breastfed by their mothers within one hour of birth compared to rural areas where the percentage was better at 26.4%. 
 
 LMC is also planning to install sanitary napkin dispensers and incinerators in the pink toilets. 
 
 Officials said that since land scarcity is a issue, they are considering to construct pink toilets and feeding centres above community toilets in areas where land is unavailable.
