AHMEDABAD: Here comes another candid admission from the   (AMC) about why our roads ruptured to smithereens. In a recent reply to an  , the   has admitted that over the past three years all road resurfacing and new road construction projects were never inspected by an independent third party.

 In early 2016, municipal commissioner at the time D Thara placed before the standing committee a proposal to form a separate quality cell that will perform road checks. But according to the RTI reply to Kalupur resident Pankaj Bhatt’s query, such a body was never formed.
 
 “In fact, the AMC had a mobile app with which road engineers were supposed to take pictures and report to the municipal commissioner about their inspections,” said a senior AMC engineer. Bhatt’s RTI reply clearly indicates that the quality cell was to consist of retired or serving engineers from state roads and building department. 
 
 On Tuesday, the AMC filed a preliminary report of its inquiry into road damage to the high court. The report showed how the buyer's copy of the IOCL bitumen bills were being duplicated to claim payments. “It is now necessary to scrutinize all 2,114 bitumen bills,“ said the vigilance note submitted by DyMC Arjav Shah. Seven officers were suspended from just five wards of two zones Paldi, Chandkheda, Ghatlodia, Gota and Thaltej.
 
 In all, in the last two years 38,386 metric tonnes of bitumen was used which was procured at the rate of Rs27,383 to Rs27,700 per metric tonne.This amounted to Rs105 crore worth of bitumen. Some of the big suppliers who are now under scanner include Akash Infrastructure which has supplied 6,593 tonnes, GPC Infrastructure s which has supplied 9,800 tonnes, Narayanan infrastructure which supplied 9,222 tonnes, and   Agarwal which has supplied bulk of the bitumen in the last two years, along with 13 other suppliers in the city
