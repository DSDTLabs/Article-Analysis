Mumbai: A tribunal on Tuesday approved Tata Steel’s purchase of  , giving a fillip to the Jamshedpur-based company’s consolidation plans. 

 The over Rs 35,000-crore Bhushan Steel purchase is Tata Steel’s biggest merger and acquisition after the $13-billion   buy in 2007. 
 
 The New Delhi branch of the National Company Law Tribunal ( ) also dismissed objections raised by creditor Larsen & Toubro and Bhushan Steel employees on Tata Steel’s bid. Besides, the tribunal has imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh each on Larsen & Toubro as well as on the employees of Bhushan Steel. The NCLT’s order now clears the way for the sale of the bankrupt asset. 
 
 Larsen & Toubro had objected to the deal on the ground that Bhushan Steel owes it Rs 900 crore and that the engineering giant wanted it to be treated on a par with financial creditors. On the other hand, the employees of the bankrupt company had raised concerns over Tata Steel’s bid eligibility. 
 
 Tata Steel, the country’s No. 2 private sector metal player, through its wholly owned subsidiary Bamnipal Steel, will acquire about 73% stake in Bhushan Steel, which has a 5.6 million-tonne capacity, for Rs 159 crore. 
 
 Besides, it has offered Rs 35,200 crore to Bhushan Steel’s financial creditors to settle the company’s existing debt. The lenders will also hold a minority stake in Bhushan Steel through conversion of debt into equity.
