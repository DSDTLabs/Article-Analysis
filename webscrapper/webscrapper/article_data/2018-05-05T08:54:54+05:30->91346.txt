KOLKATA: The   (CISCE) has informed all schools that it will not set   exams. “Only theory question papers will be set. Accordingly, the schools will need to prepare their own question papers (for practical exams),” reads the circular sent by the council.

 
 For   (Class XII) exams, however, the council sets papers for both theory and  .
 
 “If practical papers were also set by the Council from annual exams of class XI in 2018-19 academic session then the schools which do not have a good laboratory set-up would have been compelled to do so,” said a principal.
