BHUBANESWAR: The  , a micro-level grievance camp organized by the   ( ) on Monday, received a lukewarm response from the people. 

 Despite a massive awareness campaign in the run-up to the programme, very few people turned up at the 12 sub-zones where the camp was held. The BMC received around 15 grievances, as against the 168 it had received in the first camp on December 16.
 
 The Jan Sampark Diwas is a grievance redress mechanism held in all 67 wards of the BMC every fortnight. Issues such as   latrines, ration distribution under the National Food Security Act, the  , old-age pension, sanitation, encroachment and removal of debris are some of the issues on which people lodged complaints.
 
 "Of the 168 grievances received in the first camp, we have resolved 80. Since today's camp coincided with New Year's Day, many people gave it a miss," said a spokesperson of the BMC.
 
 On December 10, the BMC had prepared a map showing the places where the Jan Sampark camps would be held. A deputy commissioner of the BMC acts as the nodal officer of the proceedings.
 
 Sources in the BMC said they would evaluate the response. "If needed, we will plan new ways of making people aware of the programme. The ward officers will be asked to keep people informed on the fortnightly camp," said an officer.
 
 Poor attendance becomes a problem especially since the civic body cancels all other assignments on the day of the camp.
