Nagpur: ‘Bhagya’, a drama that showcased unbreakable bond between two lovers despite facing adversities, and marriage of one of them, was staged at Kamgar Kalyan Bhavan, Raghuji Nagar, on Wednesday evening. The play was presented at the 65th drama festival by Kamgar Kalyan Kendra, Paoni. The drama had all the elements of rotten beliefs prevailing in society, emotions and comedy, as the story progressed.  The story began with landlord Patil engaged in hectic search of a bride for his impotent son Amit. But he is reluctant to get married as he does not want to ruin the life of a girl. Despite this, Patil tricks poor labourer Garibya and settles marriage with his daughter Suhani who is in love with longtime friend Rohit.  However, the marriage of Amit with Suhani starts on a turbulent note as he starts keeping himself away from her and often picks up quarrel. The marital discord takes a violent turn and Suhani loses her eyesight in a scuffle. An angered Amit later divorces her. Though blinded, Suhani’s friend Rohit accepts and marries her and the couple lives a happy life. Actors Khobragade, who was in the role of a Patil, Amit (Avinash Meshram), Suhani (Sneha Meshram) and Rohit (Rohit Kumar) gave justice to their roles. Other characters who chipped in also did a good job. Director of the play Gowardhan Khobragade said that today’s youths have forgotten the true meaning of love. ‘Bhagya’ tried to showcase the essence of love, and its beauty. Anurag Upadhyay, one of the spectators, said, “The storyline was good and the play was aptly presented.”
