Kolkata: Ask the residents of Behala how it feels when it pours and the reply would be unanimous — pathetic. For weeks now, areas like Barisha, Shakuntala Park, Silpara and Pathakpara are submerged under knee-deep water that have stagnated in absence of a proper drainage system.

 The condition in large areas off EM Bypass is no better. Mukundapur, Kalikapur, Madurdaha, Ajaynagar, Topsia and Tangra are some of the areas where residents are facing the brunt of inundation since Saturday afternoon.
 
 The reason for the waterlogging in Behala and EM Bypass is identical — absence of underground drainage system. A mega drainage overhaul project was taken in 2010 under the Kolkata Environment Improvement Project (KEIP) funded by the Asian Development Bank. However, the project could not cover all the affected areas. “We have undertaken a second phase of the KEIP and hope to finish it by next two years. The completion of the project will ensure less waterlogging in these areas,” mayor Sovan Chatterjee said on Monday. 
 
 On VIP Road, inundation of the service road at Haldiram More is causing traffic congestion. “Nothing has improved in this area as the service road goes under water after heavy rains,” said a local. That no auto-rickshaw plies due to heavy waterlogging has added to commuters’ woes. “We are having a trying time visiting the market or going to our workplace,” said Shalu Bahal, a resident of City Centre II said. 
 
 “Excess rainwater from an adjacent central government housing estate is flooding the road. The housing estate do not have any proper drainage system. We have already informed them about the problem. If this continues, we will have no other option but to write to them,” said Bidhannagar mayor Sabyasachi Dutta.
