SIROHI (RAJASTHAN): They wed and move in with their in-laws. They serve the family and do the household work. They are the   and they have a   problem. 

 The age-old custom of a bride leaving her home to be with the bridegroom's family after marriage has been amended by the Rebari community in the state. The bride does move to her in-law's house, but after seven years.
 
  Till then, it is the boy who has to live in the girl's house and serve her parents in the manner they demand. All this is thanks to the skewed sex ratio in the community. The Rebaris, pastoralists who wander Rajasthan with their herds, have a strong presence in Sirohi, Pali and Jalore districts. A backward community, they are infamous for their preference of a male child. Since they are primarily cattle grazers and move continuously in search of newer pastures, they say concern for the safety and security of girls is the reason they prefer a male child
 
 The sex ratio is skewed so badly, the young men have difficulty finding a girl to marry: there just aren't enough of them. The girls' parents find themselves in the privileged position of being able to demand the boys not only live with them but also do the household chores, from washing clothes to grazing cattle.
 
 "We conducted a study in Reodar block of Sirohi district... In Reodar block, the Rebaris are a sizeable population and the sex ratio recorded at birth is just 634 among them. Rebaris have developed their own ways of dealing with the skewed sex ratio and this is reflected in their matrimonial alliances," said  , a member of the Society for All Round Development (SARD), Sirohi. Sharma, who works to improve the sex ratio in the area, lives in Reodar. He said the study was based on government figures from the Janani Suraksha Yojna.
 
 Surta Ram Dewasi, a youth leader of the community, said marriages in the community are subject to certain conditions.
