Nagpur: Separate Vidarbha state movement leader and chief of Vidarbha Majha party   said the recent decision of Telangana government to provide free electricity to farmers that too round the clock, should open the eyes of Vidarbha people to come out strongly in support of the cause.

 “Before it became a state, Telangana region had to suffer load-shedding for eight hours a day. Today, they are power surplus supplying uninterrupted power free to farmers and at cheaper rates to industries. Vidarbha has the same capacity and it is time people supported the movement for statehood to reap such benefits and path for fast development,” said Tirpude at a press conference. The first states’ reorganization commission had recommended both Vidarbha and Telangana as independent states, he pointed out.
 
 On the recent debate over EVM’s versus paper ballot system for casting votes, Tirpude strongly supported the ballot system saying it was more economical and transparent. Presenting figures to bolster his point, he said the money collected as deposits from electoral contestants was adequate for the Election Commission to meet expenses for conducting elections in a ballot system. But the EVM method was very costly and unreliable amid reports that machines can be tampered.
 
 Tirpude also announced that a weeklong celebration have been planned from Jan 16 to mark ex-deputy CM Nashikrao Tirpude’s birth anniversary through the Yugantar Education Society of which the senior Congress leader was founder president.
