CHANDIGARH:   chief minister   and his eight ministers on Thursday decided to pay their own  , which at present is being paid by the state government. 

 Punjab is the only state in India where the income tax of all the MLAs, including the chief minister and his fellow ministers, on account of their salary and emoluments is paid by the government. However, they have to pay income tax for the proceeds generated from other sources of income on their own.
 
 The decision was taken during the Cabinet meeting on Thursday afternoon. Capt Amarinder Singh said the decision with regard to the remaining 108 of the 117 MLAs would be taken after receiving their feedback.
 
 On February 5, the chief minister had urged all the MLAs to pay their income tax themselves, pointing out that the state government was being burdened with annual expenditure of Rs 11.08 crore on this account. While Rs 10.72 crore was being spent on income tax payment for the MLAs, the remaining was for the ministers. The income tax for each legislator paid by the Punjab government is around Rs 9.5 lakh. 
 
 An MLA in Punjab draws Rs 84,000 monthly salary and Rs 30,000 as petrol/diesel monthly reimbursement apart from travel and dearness allowances.
 
 Leader of opposition   welcomed the step. “We are willing to cooperate on this subject, but for that the CM should first drop all his advisers who have not given any meaningful advice in the last one year and are drawing huge salaries.”
 
 However, former education minister and SAD spokesman   said, “The cabinet has itself decided to take a decision about the income tax of MLAs only after taking a feedback from them. So let’s wait for the feedback from the legislators.”
