Puducherry: Puducherry police have launched a hunt for a butcher, on charges of raping and impregnating a 17-year-old girl after promising to marry her.

 Police said Silambarasan, 23, who was working in a meat stall, used to visit his colleague’s house frequently and gradually developed a relationship with his minor daughter. 
 
 The girl lived alone with her father, while her mother, separated, lived with her sisters. 
 
 Police said the youth promised to marry the minor girl and raped her on several occasions when she was alone at the house. 
 
 The girl, who fell sick, sought her mother’s help who took her to a hospital where the doctors revealed that the minor girl was seven months pregnant.
 
 Shocked, the mother questioned the girl and learned of her relationship with the butcher. She approached the butcher’s family, who promised to arrange a wedding after the girl turns 18.
 
 The youth, however, started avoiding the girl and eventually absconded, forcing the victim’s side to file a complaint against him. 
 
 The Grand Bazaar police registered a case against the youth under Section 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection Of Children from the Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), 2012 and have launched a hunt for him. 
 
 If convicted, the youth shall be punished with imprisonment varying from not less than seven years to imprisonment for life.
