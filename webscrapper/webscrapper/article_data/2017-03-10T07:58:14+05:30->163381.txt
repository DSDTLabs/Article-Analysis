UDUPI:  , a retired banker, heritage conservationist, antique collector and creator of   in  , passed away at his residence on Thursday morning. He was 83. The final rites will be held on Friday morning in Manipal, said family sources. 

 A former banker, Shenoy was deeply moved by the indifference to maintain and preserve heritage structures of South Kanara. He decided to preserve old houses and collected whatever treasures came his way, from every nook and cranny across the state. His mounting collection resulted in the creation of Hasta Shilpa in Manipal. The house had every little artefact he had collected over the years, from an arecanut cracker to abandoned pillars from old houses in Bhatkal. 
 
  Shenoy spent from his pocket as he scoured districts to prevent pieces of history vanishing. His wife Manjula, also employed with a bank, pitched in with her savings to fund her husband's passion.
 
  As his collection mounted, Hasta Shilpa was built in 1984 from the relics of demolished and abandoned old houses of the region. It was also Shenoy's personal home. But as word spread, visitors kept streaming in and the family moved out of the heritage house, and it became a museum. 
 
 Later he founded the Hasta Shilpa Heritage Trust Village, and created the famous Heritage Village in Manipal on a seven-acre plot with 26 immaculately restored centuries-old houses and museums devoted to crafts,   paintings, objects from the south Indian mercantile trade, and  's lithographs.
