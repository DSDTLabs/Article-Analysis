VISAKHAPATNAM: With the fiscal coming to a close, the   ( ) has launched a special drive to clear long-pending tax dues. The civic body has issued 6,000 notices, 700 warrants and 2,000 notices to the residents for sealing properties. Going a step forward, it has also been setting up their signboards on land of owners who have not paid their vacant land taxes.

 Out of Rs 222 crore   in 2017-18 fiscal, the GVMC could collect Rs 194 crore till date. While, it could only collect about Rs 19 crore of the demand of Rs 30 crore water tax. When it comes to property taxes, GVMC has been collecting 95% of the targeted tax each year. But that is not the case with water taxes. Despite spending Rs 48 crore per annum on electricity to pump water from reservoirs, GVMC has been lagging in household   collections. In the last three years, it could only recover about 50% of the amount. 
 
 In the 2016-17 fiscal, the corporation has succeeded in collecting only about Rs 25 crore as opposed to the annual target of Rs 48 crore. From the corresponding periods’ tax collection in 2015-16 and 2014-15, the GVMC has Rs 33 crore and Rs 28 crore water tax arrears to collect in 2017-18 financial year.
 
 According to a senior GVMC official, they have started disconnecting water supply to those residents, who have not responded to their notices for years in a row. “After water supply was discontinued, we have collected Rs 6 crore from tax evaders in the last 10 days. Collection of water tax has improved this year. However, we are still making adjustments in the revenue generated from water taxes and conducting field visits to weed out anomalies in the type of water connections,” said the official.
 
 Despite the encouraging property tax collections, about 70% people have not been paying their vacant land taxes. Now, the GVMC is installing ownership boards in those vacant lands to make the owners fall in line and pay their dues.
 
 “We want to collect 100% taxes by March 15, even though the last date is March 31. We want to ensure that there are no tax dues in 2018-19 fiscal,” said a GVMC revenue official.
