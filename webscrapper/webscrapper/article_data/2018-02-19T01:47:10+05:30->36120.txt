NAVI MUMBAI: Forty-five Shiv   workers led by   and   district chief were detained by the police in Panvel and   for staging protests against the Navi Mumbai international airport 'bhumipujan' event hosted by the state government on Sunday afternoon. 

 Sena workers said the bhumipujan invite did not have the names of Bhoir and other leaders from Raigad district. "Sena workers protested by displaying black flags after which they were intercepted by a police team," said a police official.
 
 " A mob led by Uran MLA Manohar Bhoir gathered at Owala village junction, about 5 km away from the PM's programme venue at Kombadbhuje village. The agitators were released after the programme concluded around 5pm," said Vinod Chavhan, senior inspector of Panvel City police station. 
 
 A group of around 15 Shiv Sena activists led by Raigad district unit chief Sanjay More had gathered outside Kharghar police station and shouted slogans against the BJP leaders. We detained them," said Prakash Nilewad, assistant police commissioner (Panvel division). 
 
 The Shiv Sena boycotted the 'Magnetic Maharashtra' event, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated in Mumbai on Sunday.
 
 The Sena is said to be fuming as the state government turned down its request that party chief Uddhav Thackeray be seated next to Modi at the conclave, citing protocol hurdles. BJP leaders refused to comment on the controversy.
 
 In December 2016, Uddhav sat on the dias with Modi next to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis after protocol norms were altered at the MMRDA ground in BKC for the inauguration ceremony for the Shivaji memorial.
