NAGPUR: The state   is in possession of 1,452.78 sqkm  , which is equivalent to six times the area of   (PTR).

 The state forest department has 60,120 sqkm forest land in its possession. However, 1,452.78 forest land is still with revenue department spread in 18 districts. It includes 792.14 sqkm reserve forest, 44.16 sqkm protected forest and 616.48 ‘unclassed’ land.
 
 Earlier, several reminders have been sent to district collectors and divisional commissioners but they have failed to submit reports about   in their possession.
 
 On August 4, 2016 the state government had asked forest and revenue departments to coordinate on the issue and asked district collectors to prepare a final list by December 31, 2016.
 
 Forest ministry sources said the government had also directed the district collectors to pass orders on encroachment-free forest land to be handed over to the forest department by January 15, 2017, and deputy conservators of forests were asked to take possession of forest land by January 31, 2017.
 
 “We had also asked the collectors to register name of the forest department on 7/12 (saat bara), the official document declaring ownership of the land, by February 28, 2017. However, not even one collector has followed the deadline,” said ministry officials.
 
 “Though some forest land in possession of revenue department has been handed over the 1452.78 sqkm land still remains with it. This land is apart from 953.50 sqkm unclassed forest land which according to revenue department was unsuitable for transfer,” said a senior official.
 
 The basic purpose to hand over the forest land is for better management, but it has been observed that most of these lands are misused and are in possession of influential persons. These have been occupied without any proposals for forest land diversion under the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980.
 
 The forest land in possession of revenue department also includes 15,000 hectare land having mangroves. Land with mangroves has been legally declared as forests.
 
 “Here too 5,500 hectare land is with revenue department, which is delaying the possession by conducting a separate inquiry about the said lands,” said officials.
 
 Barring cities like Mumbai and Mumbai suburban and districts like Sindudhurg, Aurangabad, Nanded, Parbhani, Hingoli, Beed, Osmanabad, Latur, Buldhana, Washim, and Akola all other districts have forest land in their possession.
