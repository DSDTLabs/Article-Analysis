KOZHIKODE: Noted writer   has said that CBSE top brass should   on the issue of   being forced to remove their   during the   held in Kannur on Sunday.

 Speaking after inaugurating the stage competitions of the Calicut University inter-zone arts festival here on Wednesday, he said that CBSE authorities cannot absolve themselves of the responsibility of the inhuman and bizarre act by asking the school management to tender an apology and by suspending four women teachers.
 
 “It is the CBSE authorities who are the prime accused in the incident. Just the suspension of four poor teachers who are paid a measly salary is not enough. If anyone has to be punished on the issue, it is the CBSE top brass in New Delhi,” he said.
 
 The writer also said that though chief minister responded to the issue strongly, the assembly was found wanting in handling the issue with the seriousness it deserved.
