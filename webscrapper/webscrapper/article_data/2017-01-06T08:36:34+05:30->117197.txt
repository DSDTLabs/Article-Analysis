CHANDIGARH:   has 3.85 lakh   and of these around 92,000 have been deposited after   on Wednesday. Punjab Police are hopeful of a complete compliance in a week's time. 

 According to the Punjab election department, earlier an appeal was made to the gun owners in this regard by the Election Commission but now it has been made mandatory to deposit the weapons with the district authorities.
 
 The state has a poor record when it comes to letting go of weapons ahead of the elections. During the 2014   election, out of the 2.87 lakh licensed weapons in the state, only 1.03 lakh were deposited with the senior superintendents of police (SSPs) or commissioners in 27 towns and cities. 
 
 As many as 11 of Punjab's 22 districts figured in the list of the top 50 districts in India with highest number of arms licenses. These include Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Firozepur, Hoshiarpur, Sangrur and Muktsar. As per available figures, the border district of Gurdaspur, besides Bathinda and Ludhiana top the state with 36,294, 36,232 and 26,756 licenses, respectively. However, in terms of actual number of weapons, Patiala and Ludhiana topped the list as per information collected by the election department in 2014. There could be more than one firearm on one licence.
 
 Experts point out that even if there is one firearm per personnel, the state police have just 7% of the total private licensed firearms.
 
 In view of the high number of licenses, the Punjab traffic department had to write to the government pointing out that there were growing instances of guns being used in incidents of road rage and the number of arms liences being issued in the state should be restricted. The weapons include .32 bore revolvers to .12 bore double barrel guns and the most common are .315 rifle and the .22 pistol.
