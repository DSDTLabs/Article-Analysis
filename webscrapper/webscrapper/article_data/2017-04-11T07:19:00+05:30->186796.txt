FEROZPUR: Traffic on the   road remained disrupted for a few hours on Monday following a protest by villagers of  , who were demanding a probe into the death of a youth on Sunday night. They lifted the blockade only after senior police officials assured them of action in the matter.

 Buta Singh, a resident of the village, was found injured and unconscious on Ferozepur-Fazilka road, near   police post, on Sunday night. He was taken to the Ferozepur civil hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead.
 
 Contesting the police theory that Buta may have been hit by a vehicle resulting in his death, his family members alleged a conspiracy. “He had got calls on his mobile phone, following which he left the home in the evening,” alleged Banta Singh, uncle of the deceased. He alleged the police had not entertained their request for probe for murder, following which they were left with no other option but to disrupt traffic.
 
 Ferozepur SP (detective)   and DSP Balwinder Singh said the matter would be probed thoroughly and assured the protesters that police would initiate proceedings as per the finding of the probe.
