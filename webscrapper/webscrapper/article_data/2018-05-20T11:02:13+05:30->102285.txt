BENGALURU: Imagine a summer camp for children at a police station! Well, it became a reality when   police station in   district played host to a camp for 400 children.

 The kids were not only explained the process involving filing of first information report (FIR) and arrest of criminals but were also shown how the lockups and handcuffs worked. The free camp was held between 9am and 1pm on Saturday.
 
 Police inspector K P   said: “This is the first time a summer camp has been organised inside a police station. Our aim is to send across a message that the police force is people-friendly. We want to dispel negative notions among children about police. We’re not trying to create a positive image but we are surely trying to erase the negative image that the public holds about cops.”
 
 The camp also had a session on personal hygiene conducted by three doctors from a private hospital. At a discussion on sexual abuse, children were taught the difference between good touch and bad touch. “The video was self-explanatory and the kids were informed of ways to protect themselves from miscreants at various places, including school,” said M L  , deputy superintendent of police ( ).
 
 District fire force officer   and his team explained fire-safety measures and demonstrated the use of water spray hose during a fire accident.
 
 “All of us have noted down the contact numbers of police stations in the surrounding areas and control rooms. We’ll alert police if we come across any untoward incidents,” said   B, Class II student.
