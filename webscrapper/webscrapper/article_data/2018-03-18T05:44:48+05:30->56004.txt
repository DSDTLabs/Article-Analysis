MUMBAI: The police are likely to revoke the performance licence of  's Drums Beat bar following a raid by an anti-narcotics cell (ANC) team last Wednesday.   officials were allegedly beaten up during the raid by the bar's bouncers. 

 A source said that senior police officers were upset with the illegalities at the bar and the fact that it was running under the nose of local police. Upset with the local police's inaction, Police commissioner Datta   had sought ANC help. 
 
 Padsalgikar on Friday temporarily shifted senior inspector of Tardeo police station   to main control room and initiated an inquiry into the raid. After the raid, ANC deputy commissioner   and the Tardeo police had arrested nine persons, including hotel staffers and some bar girls.
