PUNE: Independent candidates contesting the   will soon blow the poll bugle through a  . 

 Symbols as incongruous as harmonium, nagada, shuttle cock, cricket bat, road roller, sewing machine or even a letter box, are likely to greet you when you visit polling stations on February 21. 
 
 Unlike registered state or national-level parties, independent candidates — numbering in the hundreds — do not have a fixed poll symbol, and have been asked by the election commission to pick from 48 such symbols to catch the voter’s eye.
 
 At the time of filing nominations, independents were asked to provide a choice of three symbols. On Wednesday, returning officers will allot one of the the symbols to each candidate. If more than one had asked for the same symbol, it would be allotted through a draw of lots.
 
 From musical instruments to kitchen and home appliances to sports, the symbols will appeal to every demographic, feel officials and candidates.
 
 According to a senior political leader, women candidates tend to prefer kitchen items for symbols are they are most likely to attract women voters. Younger candidates, on the other hand, go for sports-related symbols, like cricket bat or batsman, to appeal to the youth. 
 
 “I have put down my preference as a cricket bat,” said an independent candidate from the   area. “It is a symbol which can be easily remembered. Everyone loves cricket, especially the youth. A poll symbol is one of the easiest ways to connect with the voters. There are still people who can’t read and write and for them, a poll symbol plays a vital role.” 
 
 With hundreds of independent candidates in the fray, election authorities expect the process of allotting the symbols to be completed by the evening.
