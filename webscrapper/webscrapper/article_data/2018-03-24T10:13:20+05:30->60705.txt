Newbie director Zakariya's film ' ' has hit theaters and with a fresh concept and talented actors, it has already managed to win hearts.

 The movie does not have in leading ladies in the conventional sense. However, two women characters of the film impress viewers right from the beginning and one can't help feeling empathetic with these wonderfully defined female figures of the story. Actresses Savithri and Sarasa, who have been part of theater for about 55 years and have also won State Awards, are the ladies who made a mark through this film.
 
 Savithra plays the role of Jameela, Soubin Shahir's character Majeed's mom. Sarasa, meanwhile, essays the role of their relative named Beeyumma, who is quite fond of both Majeed and the Nigerian character in the movie, played by Samuel Abiola Robinson.
