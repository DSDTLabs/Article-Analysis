NAGPUR: The   launched by municipal commissioner   to recover Rs191 crore arrears from 1.78 lakh   defaulters has failed to give desired results. The NMC could only mop up Rs23.62 crore and the total revenue property tax collection for the financial year 2016-2017 is Rs185 crore.

 To recover the huge outstanding amount, the civic chief on March 15 had announced an amnesty scheme waiving 90% on interests and fines.
 
 There are 5.31 lakh property owners within the city limits. The then standing committee chairman Sudhir Raut had set a target of Rs306.45 crores for 2016-2017. The earlier target by the civic chief was Rs250 crore, which he revised to Rs240.11 crore in the budget presented recently for the last fiscal. The civic administration failed to achieve even the revised target.
