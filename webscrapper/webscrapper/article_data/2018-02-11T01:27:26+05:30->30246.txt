GURUGRAM:   continued to reel under long   even as angry residents stormed into DHBVN’s sub-division office two days ago and protested.

 Residents of several housing societies in the area told TOI that the use of diesel generator sets had shot up because unscheduled power outages had been stretching into hours.
 
 Over 2,500 families living in New Palam Vihar townships, including Raheja Atharva, Puri Diplomatic Greens, Mahindra Aura, Brisk Lumbini, New Palam Vihar Colony and Sai Kunj, have been facing constant   over the last two months.
 
 The locality had a day-long outage without prior notification on February 7, residents alleged. This led to a faceoff between residents and villagers of New Palam Vihar and the discom, which was only resolved after senior officials intervened. DHBVN officials did not comment on the issue. 
 
 “We have around 799 apartments here, and   run round the clock,” said Yashish Yadav, a resident of Mahindra Aura. Yadav said the situation has worsened over the last few days due to a rupture in a high-tension power line.
 
 DBHVN superintendent engineer (old Gurugram circle) Anil Goyal did not take calls. The New Palam Vihar sub-divisional officer said, “An 11 kV cable had a fault due to moisture caused by fog. We have resolved the issue.”
