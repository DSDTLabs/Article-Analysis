 According to the complaint, after the exam for the post of sub-inspector for state excise was conducted at various centres in the state last month, over 500 answer sheets were packed, sealed and transported to Mumbai for scanning/checking, but one answer sheet was missing from the bunch. “As a practice, the sealed bunch of answer sheets is opened and videographed. The authorities found one paper missing,” said an officer. “We have begun our probe and will summon the candidate whose answer sheet is missing. It’s too early to make a comment as the probe is in its initial stage.” 
 
 The police are trying to ascertain whose lapse or negligence caused the paper to go missing. “We don’t want candidates to panic...we will soon find out who is responsible,” said the officer. “We need to first check whether the candidate submitted the answer sheet or not, and if the candidate submitted it, then where did it go.” 
 
 MPSC conducts exams for various government departments like deputy collector, deputy superintendent of police, administrators and sales tax.
