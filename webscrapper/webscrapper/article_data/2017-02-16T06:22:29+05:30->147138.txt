Hyderabad needs to develop safety culture and dedicated ethical outlook on pollution control,“ said environmental activist and scientist Dr  .
 
 Even municipal sweeping machines and garbage transport vehicles add to pollution due to improper maintenance.The city is unable to maintain water bodies and control soil pollution.
