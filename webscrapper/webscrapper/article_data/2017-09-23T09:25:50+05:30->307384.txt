LUCKNOW: UP government has reached out to Shiva devotees across the world to contribute for development of   in Varanasi’s   temple whose foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister   on Friday. The temple trust needs Rs 15 crore for the project that aims to feed 15,000 people daily, particularly the poor.

 The department of religious affairs started an online donation service for the purpose on Monday. Now, anyone across the world can log in and contribute to the cause.
 
 North and south Indian food would be cooked in modular kitchens running on solar power at the Annakshetra and served as ‘prasad’ of Lord Vishwanath. The three-storeyed building will have dining courts to accommodate 1,000 pilgrims.
 
 The Annakshtra will work on the ‘Robinhood principle’ wherein the poor won’t be charged anything, while others will have to shell out a nominal sum.
 
 The   is revival of the tradition started by Maharani Ahilya Bai Holkar of Indore and Rani Bhawani of Midnapore, Bengal in the mid-18th century (1763-1770). “The two queens linked the tradition to a metaphor related to goddess Parvati, who as   would feed anyone coming to her doorstep,” said Rana PB Singh, retired professor, cultural geography department, Banaras Hindu University.
 
 Singh added that in olden days scores of seers were served food through the Annakshetra located at Raja Ghat. However, the tradition has now been reduced to a mere tokenism. “About 100-120 seers and beggars are served food at Annakshetra daily. The number increases four-fold on festivals,” said Damdar Banarasi, a poet based in Varanasi.
 
 Divisional commissioner Nitin Ramesh Gokarn said that construction will start immediately and the project will be made operational within 11 months.
