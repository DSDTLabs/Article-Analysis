Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has issued a ban on the movement of   in the district after two of the animals in Jewar were found to have been affected with   — an infectious disease which potentially spreads to humans if in direct contact with horses.

 The order has put band parties and horse traders in a fix in the wedding season as they have taken bookings. Sources said that of the 1,300-odd horses in the district, only 253 were “randomly chosen” and two were found to have been infected with glanders.
 
 SK Dwivedi, chief veterinary officer, told TOI the two horses belonged to a trader named Wajid Ali. Alarmed by the report, a team from the health department visited Ali’s house on Thursday and conducted tests on his family.
 
 Sources said the samples had been sent to the National Research Centre on Equines in Hisar for testing and a report would be prepared in 15 days.
 
 “We read news reports on glanders and that horses have been banned in the district. But this is a wedding season and bookings have been made. We are having arguments with customers every day. Some customers are pressuring us for horses as the weddings draw nearer,” said a band-wallah in Sector 22.
 
 The band-wallahs said they are being forced to call horse traders in neighbouring Hapur and Ghaziabad to meet the demand.
 
 “I own only two horses and got them tested. Bur since horses are much in demand for weddings in Noida and Delhi, we have to call horse traders in Hapur and Ghaziabad. I have cancelled two weddings as I do not have horses to provide,” said Chaman Lal, a band-wallah in Harola.
