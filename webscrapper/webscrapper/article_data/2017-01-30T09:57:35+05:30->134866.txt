BHOPAL: He was 48 when his land was acquired by the district administration in   for construction of a road. After years of litigation, Shankar Prasad Jha still waits for justice. However, a court order two days ago revived this 75-year-old’s hopes.

 A local court in Orchha ordered to attach property of district collector of Tikamgarh-collector’s official car, air conditioner and furniture among other things, to compensate elderly villager for his 0.090 hectares of land.
 
 “The court ordered to attach the property of the collector and inform it on January 31,” Jha’s lawyer Santosh Pateria told TOI.
 
 The district collector of   is on leave. However, office sources said, “Preparations are on to execute the court’s order to compensate Jha. It is likely to be done within the deadline set by the court.”
 
 Jha’s ordeal started in 1991 when his small piece of land was acquired by the government for construction of a by-pass road. Initially, Jha shuttled to the SDM’s office in Orchha for compensation, but in vain. Few years later, he had approached the court.
 
 On December 23 in 1999, the court in Orchha passed a decree in favour of Jha and directed the district administration to compensate Jha. But Jha could not get compensation.
 
 “Six months ago, Judge Pradeep Dubey served a   to the collector and said why can’t she be sent to jail and her property be attached. Then the collector had deputed an   to resolve the issue in one month, but it did not happen and ultimately the court passed this order,” said Jha’s advocate Pateria.
 
 Jha is happy and hopes that he would get compensation, either in cash or land for land.
 
 “ Let us see how prasashan (administration) reacts,” he told local media.
