ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI:   PM   ’s foreign affairs adviser  , who had said in December last year that Pakistan’s intelligence agencies had “insufficient evidence” against alleged Indian spy  , presented a dossier on Friday portraying him as a one-man demolition squad.

 The chargesheet paints Jadhav as a fictional hero not unlike Hollywood’s Rambo who blew up pipelines, planted IEDs in camps, and planned and executed numerous attacks that resulted in deaths and damage to property — all without giving any specific numbers on casualties. This is a far cry from Aziz’s earlier statement in the upper house of Pakistan’s parliament: “The dossier on Jadhav contained mere statements. It did not have any conclusive evidence.”
 
 In the chargesheet released on Friday, Aziz defended the death sentence for Jadhav, saying the government had “concrete evidence”. The chargesheet also gave a “timeline” of Jadhav’s trial. According to the chargesheet, Jadhav’s confessional video statement was made on March 25, 2016; the FIR filed on April 8; and his interrogation begun on May 2. The death sentence was “endorsed” on April 10, it added.
 
 A qualified law officer was provided to defend Jadhav, it claimed, and added that the statements of all witnesses were recorded under oath, in the presence of the accused, in court. According to the chargesheet, Jadhav was allowed to question the witnesses.
