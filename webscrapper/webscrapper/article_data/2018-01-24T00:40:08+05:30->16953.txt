Tirupur: As many as 300 cadre belonging to DMK, Congress, CPM, CPI, MDMK, TMC, VCK, Dravidar Kazhagam and other outfits on Tuesday staged a candle light vigil in front of Tirupur railway station, demanding justice for two city-based medical students, who were found in Delhi in as many incidents. Though the parties had called for a two-hour bandh, only a few commercial establishments responded to this.  The party functionaries had earlier urged traders to down their shutters from 5pm-7pm to express solidarity with them, but it didnâ€™t evoke much response.  Dr S Sharathprabhu and Dr Saravanan Ganesan, who were pursuing postgraduate medical courses at the University College of Medical Sciences and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, respectively, found dead in different circumstances in a span of one-and-a-half years. Saravanan was found dead in June 2016,. The Delhi police are yet to solve the case even after Delhi high court raised suspicion that it could be a murder. Sharathprabhu was found dead at his Delhi residence last week.
