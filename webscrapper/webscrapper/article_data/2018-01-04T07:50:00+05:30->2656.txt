Ludhiana: The police have booked two employees of a courier company for fraudulently withdrawing money from the accounts of customers of Indus Bank, Urban Estate, Dugri. 

 Police said the bank had tied up with the company to deliver debit cards and other confidential documents to customers. “Ramandeep Kaur and Mukul Garg, both residents of Phase I, Dugri, tampered with the cards as well as documents to withdraw cash from the customers’ accounts. They would also impersonate as bank employees and call up the customers to get their bank details. The duo used different names as they played the con game,” said a cop. 
 
 In his police complaint, bank manager Saurav Kumar said, “The bank received several complaints from its customers that cash was being withdrawn fraudulently from their accounts. As part of our investigation, we scanned the footage of CCTV cameras installed in ATM kiosks from where the cash was withdrawn. The footages helped nail the two.” 
 
 Kumar alleged that the accused either unsealed the documents sent through their courier company or must have cloned the cards to carry out the frauds. “They would also call up the customers, seeking their ATM PINs,” he added.
 
 Moti Nagar police station assistant sub-inspector Paramdeep Singh said the CCTV cameras installed at ATM kiosks had captured the duo using different debit cards to withdraw cash. “We are investigating their modus operandi, as it is suspected that they might have cloned the cards.” 
 
 A case has been registered.
