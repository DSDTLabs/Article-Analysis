PATNA: CPI-ML (Liberation) general secretary   on Friday lashed out at the state government for forcefully roping in people and misusing government machinery for the human chain formation across the state on Saturday.

 He also came down heavily on Prime Minister   for the demonetisation. Dipankar said the voters of Delhi and Bihar have already taught BJP a lesson and now the people of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa would also teach a similar lesson to the saffron party.
 
 Commenting on the growing bonhomie between Bihar CM   and PM Modi, he said, “Their friendship is not new. They have revived it only. One has forced people to stand in queue for cash while the other is engrossed in forming a queue for his prohibition,” he said, adding that the state government was trying to induce state machinery fear into the people’s mind to ensure their attendance in the human chain.
 
 “Both are arrogant and making fun of the mandate given to them by the voters,” Dipankar said, adding that on January 26, the party would hoist flags at village level to demand justice for  , who committed suicide last year, and  , whose death in Vaishali recently was shrouded in mystery.
 
 He said the party would also organise ‘Adhikaar Yatra’ from Begusarai on February 19 for the workers of unorganised sector. “Education, employment and right to land is the basics of social justice, but the three components are missing in Bihar,” he added.
