AGRA: Heightened strictness in the evaluation process of   has started showing its effect. Out of the 1,700 students whose five-year integrated law exam results were declared by the university, 90% have failed. The university administration added that the remaining 15,000 students would get their results by January 20. Earlier, for the first time, the university had organised examinations at nodal centres despite strong disapproval by private colleges, to clamp down on cheating.

  Following some tough measures taken by vice-chancellor   who took charge of the university on December 13, 2016, evaluation of answer sheets was conducted under the supervision of retired teachers.
  
  Soon after evaluations began, authorities were surprised to see blank answer sheets surfacing one after the other. In many other answer sheets, students had barely answered a couple of questions, not enough to earn them passing marks. When the issues was brought to the notice of the VC, he ordered scanning of all mark sheets to rule out any scope of irregularities. 
  
  According to the sources, the cheating rackets running in the city had advised students to leave their answer sheets blank when they saw no scope of copying amid strict invigilation during the exams. The plan, according to them, was to later replace blank pages of answer sheets with the right answers in connivance with the lower university staff.
  
  However, even that couldn’t happen due to strict measures taken by the varsity administration during evaluation.
  
  The university’s spokesperson,  , said, “This time, several new measures were taken to ensure fair conduct of examination and evaluation process. Till today, results of 1,700 students of five-year integrated law course have been declared. Out of these, mere 10% students have secured passing marks and the rest have failed. Results of around 15,000 more students of the LLB course are left to be declared, which will be done by January 20.”
