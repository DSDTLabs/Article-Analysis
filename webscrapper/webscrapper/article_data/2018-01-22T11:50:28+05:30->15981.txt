MALAPPURAM: As uncertainty over selection of fifth time applicants for haj pilgrimage continues, the state   has decided not to carry out draw of lots ( ) to select pilgrims for this season. However, the haj committee of India (HCoI) is likely to hold the draw of lots for applicants from the state on Monday itself, as per the schedule. 

 The state committee has already approached the Supreme Court against the proposal of the Centre to do away with the existing policy of allowing fifth time applicants to get selected for the pilgrimage without draw of lots.
 
 In view of the upcoming case before the SC, the state haj committee had also sought permission from the haj committee of India to postpone the draw of lots for   from the state to February 2 from scheduled date of January 22. But, the HCoI has rejected the demand and asked the state to carry out draw of lots process on Monday itself. 
 
 State haj committee chairman   said the committee has decided not to carry out draw of lots as the petition filed by the committee is still pending with the Supreme Court. "We don't know why the HCoI is adamant on their stand. The state haj committee will follow direction from the HCoI if it will select pilgrims from state through draw of lots. But, the list of pilgrims would be finalised only based on the SC verdict on January 30,"he said.
 
  The HCoI has allotted a total of 10, 981 seats- including an additional 3,423 seats which remained vacant in other states-for the state this year. As many as 1,270 pilgrims who are above 70 years of age and 1,121 women who will undertake the journey without assistance of men, have already been directly selected for the pilgrimage. 
 
 The draw of lots is being held to select the pilgrims for the remaining 8,587 seats. A recently held meeting of the state haj committee had demanded the HCoI to allot 3,000 more seats. The state committee had also demanded HCoI to restore the haj embarkation point at   airport this year.
