COIMBATORE: The   government has failed in securing Rs 2,500 crore meant for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe (SC and  ) students from the central government, said DMK working president  .

 In a statement on Thursday, Stalin said Rs 35 crore meant for scholarship of SCST students in the state has also been taken back by the Centre due to the lethargy of the state government. “It is condemnable that the AIADMK government has not collected the funds for this scheme," he said. “The Adi Dravida welfare minister should immediately visit New Delhi and take steps to collect the funds to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore," he said.
