Extraordinary achievements of women in different sports like kabaddi, hockey, wrestling is the subject of a soon-to-be aired   on Doordarshan. The show 'Bitiya Mein Hai Dum', hosted by wrestler  , will feature interviews describing struggles of female sportspersons and how they fought odds to win laurels for the country. Sangram informs us that he started shooting for the 10-episode series in December, just before the release of Dangal, and has interviewed five female achievers so far. "The show will not just talk about their struggle, initial days of training and how they won awards and medals, but will also reveal a lot about their determination, passion for sports and how they are in their personal lives," says Sangram.

  The first episode will feature wrestler  . "Apart from her, I also interviewed the former captain of Indian women's hockey team   and kabaddi player Kavita. I have not interviewed Geeta and   so far, but other award-winning female wrestlers, who come from small villages in   and have made a mark in the field. Being a sportsperson, I know about the hardships one has to face to achieve something and because they are women, things are all the more difficult for them. Ladke toh kaise bhi reh lenge, ladka gaon mein knicker pehan kar bhi ghoomega toh koi kuch nahi bolega, par ladki ka aisa karna bahut badi baat hai. Gaon mein bolte hain yeh humara tradition nahi hai. Wrestler Mamta and kabaddi player Kavita told me that when they used to go out to play, every neighbour would talk behind their back. Jo aunty unke ghar ke paas rehti thi, woh aur logon ko bolti thi in ladkiyon ke saath mat utho-baitho, yeh ladkiyaan theek nahi hain, yeh kabaddi khelti hain, inka chaal-chalan theek nahi hai. There are many such startling facts that these players will be sharing on the show. The idea is to let people know about the hard work that these girls have put in to bring medals and awards for this country," informs Sangram.
