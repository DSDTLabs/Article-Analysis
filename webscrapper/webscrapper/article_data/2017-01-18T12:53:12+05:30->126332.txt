  There have been differences between former MLA Indradev Singh and Moradabad MP Thakur Sarvesh Kumar for a long time. In the last assembly polls, there was rivalry between the two as well. While BJP had declared Singh as its candidate from  , Sarvesh Kumar fielded his wife, Sadhana Singh, from same seat on Mahan Dal ticket. The BJP lost the seat.
  
  Similar situation has emerged again in the   election in 2014 when Indradev’s son, Saurabh Pratap, filed the nomination against Sarvesh Kumar on the ticket of TMC. However, Pratap later withdrew his nomination, and Sarvesh Kumar won the MP seat from Moradabad.
  
  BJP district president Rajeev Sisodia said, “Former MLA Indradev Singh and MP Sarvesh Kumar’s son Sushant Kumar are demanding the party ticket from Badapur. The party is yet to take a decision.”
  
  According to some sources “there is a turf war between Indradev Singh and Sushant Kumar for the BJP ticket. The matter has to be resolved amicably, but time, it seems, is running out for BJP.”
  
  Talking to TOI, Indradev Singh said, “I had been an MLA from here. I have asked for the party ticket from Badapur seat. MP Sarvesh Kumar’s son is also claiming the ticket. It is the party that will decide.”
  
  Interestingly, Badapur seat is dominated by thakurs. Here both the claimants are thakurs and if the matter is not sorted out amicably, there are chances that the issue will become too hot for BJP to handle.
