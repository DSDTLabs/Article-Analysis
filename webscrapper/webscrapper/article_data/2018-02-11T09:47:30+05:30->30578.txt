KANPUR: Residents were left in a fix after an ATM of a private bank in south Kanpur's Kidwainagar area started dispensing fake Rs 500 notes on Saturday. 

 Some of the notes had ' ' printed on them instead of '  and, 'Full of Fun' and printed in English with an image of Mahatma Gandhi on them. The fake notes also bore a ' ' watermark.
 
 Himanshu Tripathi, who had gone to withdraw Rs 10,000 from the ATM and received those fake notes, said, "The notes were guaranteed by 'Children Bank Of India' rather than RBI, wherein the authority promised to pay the 'bearer five hundred coupons'. It also had 'Churan Label' printed on them instead of the watermark." The notes, however, bore the same colour and font as original notes, Tripathi added.
 
 Ramendra Awasthi, a resident of Kidwainagar, went to the same ATM to withdraw cash and got one Rs 500 note with the same anomalies. "I withdrew Rs 20,000 and got one note which had 'Children Bank of India' printed on it," he said.
