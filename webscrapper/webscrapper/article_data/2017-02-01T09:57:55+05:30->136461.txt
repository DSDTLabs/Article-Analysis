 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress are equally responsible for the instability in Goa’s political system for the last 15 years, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader,   said.
 
  Speaking at AAP’s public meeting in Quepem on Monday, he stated that Goans were absolutely frustrated with the corruption that existed during the Congress rule in the last decade and it was this frustration that helped the BJP come to power.
  
  In the March 2012 state assembly elections, the BJP made various promises to the electorate, but it has, till now, failed to fullfill these promises, he said, reminding the voters that some of the party’s poll promises included the recovery of illegal mining loot worth Rs 36,000 crore and that of finishing corruption in the state.
  
  “BJP assured Goans that they would rid the state of casinos and illegal activities such as drugs, but the party has done a U-turn on these and other promises. This has prompted the common man to consider voting for a party constituted by common people. “Common people vote for common men,” he said.
  
  AAP’s chief miniterial candidate and Cuncolim aspirant Elvis Gomes, party convener, Patricia Fernades, Quepem candidate Joao Fernades, party worker and councilor Manuel Colaco and party workers Durgadas Gaonkar and   were present at the meeting.
  
  Gomes alleged that in today’s political scenario, both BJP and Congress are ‘match fixers’. “Theirs is a give and take relationship, this is how they fool the people. Quepem MLA Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar has not done anything much for the Quepem constituency which consists of a large number of farmers,” he said.
  
  AAP’s Quepem aspirant Fernandes said, “I am representing the best party for the common men, one that understand our needs,” he said.
