NEW DELHI:  , the government’s policy think-tank, has set up four task forces to prepare a roadmap for reducing pollution levels in the country.
 
  The task forces on transport, biofuels, industries and air will be headed by Niti Aayog’s CEO,  , and will include officials of the ministries of transport, environment and petroleum,   and the   ( ).
  
  “The task forces will submit their reports shortly, following which we will reach out to the Delhi government to implement the recommendations,” a senior official, who did not wish to be named, told ET.
  
  The task forces are expected to give a detailed action plan, highlighting the role of all stakeholders and setting timelines. Base on the results of the Delhi plan, the scheme will be expanded nationally, the official quoted earlier said.
  
  The task forces will use the report prepared by Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, in 2015 as the base to kickstart assessment of the pollution problem in the national capital.
  
  According to the report, a big contributor to Delhi’s air pollution is road dust, which accounts for about 35% of tiny particles in the air, known as PM 2.5, followed by vehicles, domestic cooking, power plants and industries.
  
  Vehicular emissions account for about a quarter of PM 2.5 levels, going up to 36% during winters. Industry body CII had, in November last year, launched its 'Clean Air-Better Life' initiative which aims to engage businesses, civil society and the government to take "actionable steps" to cut pollution in the Delhi, which ranks among the most polluted cities in the world.
  
  The industry body had recommended collecting soil and road dust through vacuum cleaning and using it to fill up low-lying areas. Besides, it had proposed that the government should incentivise use of ‘Happy Seeder’ to convert rice straw into mulch as fertiliser and bring down the high excise duty on ethanol to encourage ethanol-blended clean fuel.
