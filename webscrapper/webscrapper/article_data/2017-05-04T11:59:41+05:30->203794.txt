I had to face many problems and one day, I was forced to become a sex worker after a few people on the highway sexually abused me on the pretext of giving alms. It happened repeatedly in my life and gradually turned me into a sex worker. Now, I plan to start a poultry unit,“ said   K C, a transgender.

Now I am entitled to get a loan of up to Rs 30,000 and Rs 20,000 in subsidy from the women and child development department. I will start dance classes for children by renting a small house in Haveri,“said Laxmi.
 
 “Vijaya Bank launched this scheme to help bring transgenders into mainstream society. It's a humble beginning to transform the lives of transgenders, said  , managing director and CEO, Vijaya Bank.
