NEW DELHI: State-run generation utility  , Delhi’s main supplier of electricity, is considering   on   ( ) – the Anil Ambani group-owned discom supplying power to the   area in the national Capital – to recover Rs 239 crore overdue since last 10 months.

 NTPC supplies about Rs 300 crore worth of electricity every month to the two Ambani group discoms in Delhi — BSES   and BYPL. As per the terms of the power purchase agreement with NTPC, the two discoms have to clear their payment within a calendar month.
 
 Delhi has been allotted 3,930 mw from NTPC power stations, including 693 mw from APCPL Jhajjar, NTPC’s joint venture with the Delhi and Haryana governments. More than 2,000 mw of this total allocation is for the Ambani group discoms —   and BYPL.
 
 According to NTPC, these discoms, particularly BYPL, are not making payment according to the PPA provisions. With mounting dues, NTPC had issued a notice for stopping supply to these discoms in May 2016. But after the discoms assured clearing their dues by this financial year, NTPC put the notice in abeyance.
 
 But the company has been forced reconsider the option of pulling the plug again as BYPL has failed to clear Rs 239 crore dues even after 10 months of assurance.
 
 NTPC says fuel spends make up approximately 70% of its cost of power and have to be paid upfront to fuel suppliers. “Such continued non-payment by Delhi discoms would make it very difficult for NTPC to keep maintaining its reliable supplies in the ensuing peak summer season when Delhi’s demand is supposed peak to 6,600 mw as per estimates made by discoms,” NTPC said.
