CHENNAI: Sidelined   leader TTV   on Monday said jailed party leader and his aunt, V K  , had shot a video of former   chief minister J   when she was undergoing treatment in Apollo Hospitals here last year. The footage would be submitted to any inquiry panel set up by the government, he said.

 Dhinakaran was responding to reporters in the wake of a controversy over minister Dindigul C Sreenivasan’s confession about lying on former CM’s health condition. 
 
 
 
 Jayalalithaa was admitted to hospital on September 22 night.
 
 “CCTV footages are available with the hospital. We have a footage shot by Chinnamma (Sasikala), after insisted by Jayalalithaa over her weight loss,” Dhinakaran said, adding that the ailing leader was in night wear and was watching television when the video was shot.
 
 “When asked by him (pointing to his supporter and R K Nagar poll incharge, P Vetrivel) if the footage could be used during R K Nagar bypolls, Sasikala said no. She told us to seek setting up inquiry commission ourselves and submit it at an appropriate time. We are ready to give to any inquiry panel, CBI or whatever. We are not scared,” Dhinakaran said. 
 
 Dhinakaran, however, alleged that chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had announced an inquiry commission led by a retired judge to convince O Panneerselvam to join hands. “Rather than a retired judge, it should be by a sitting judge,” he said
 
 He criticised minister Sreenivasan for changing his stance every three months on Jayalalithaa’s health condition. “Will he say after three months that what he said now was under pressure from   and  ,” Dhinakaran asked.
