GURUGRAM: The historic   in Bhondsi, developed by the forest corporation, has been functioning without electricity for the last two months after the   allegedly snapped the power supply. 

 According to Subhash Yadav of the Haryana Forest Development Corporation (HFDC), the problem started after a letter was sent to the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), requesting it that the power connection be transferred in the name of the corporation.
 
 “Even though there were pending bills of a few lakhs from the village panchayat, we decided to get the connection transferred in the name of the forest corporation and pay off the   on behalf of the panchayat. However, discom disconnected the connection, claiming that a bill worth Rs 4.53 lakh is pending and the connection can’t be resumed unless all dues are cleared. Despite repeated requests, power supply hasn’t been restored,” said Yadav.
 
 “We have been running the office with the help of diesel generators. With the onset of summer, it is becoming even more difficult to manage. Besides, the generators are causing pollution in this eco-sensitive area,” said a ground staff at the centre.
 
 DHBVN officials on the other hand said power to the centre will only be resumed after pending dues are paid.“One connection had a pending bill of Rs 7 lakh, while the other one had a pending bill of Rs 4.53 lakh, which has not been paid. Power will be resumed only after payment of the pending bill.”
