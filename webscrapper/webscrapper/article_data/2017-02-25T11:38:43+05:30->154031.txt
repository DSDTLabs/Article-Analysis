Roshni requests Piyush to attend 'puja' for the sake of their family. He nods and leaves. Elsewhere, Anjali wears a short dress for Aaliya's party. When Saroj objects to it, Vikram comes to her defence. Saroj cleverly manages to take out the address of the venue from Anjali's bag, along with her cell phone. 

 After Anjali is off to the party, Saroj tells Vikram that Anjali has forgotten her phone at home. She tells him that they should go to the party and give it to her, just in case she gets stuck somewhere. 
 
 Vaidehi asks Piyush to come and meet her the next day but he tells her about the puja that he has to attend with Roshni. This makes Vaidehi upset and she plans to ruin the puja at the Bharadwaj house. 
 
 
  
 Unaware that Vikram and Saroj have reached the party, Anjali breaks her fast. She is caught while eating by Vikram and Tai Ji. It is then that her friend Shanaya comes to her rescue. She tells Vikram how she had forced Anjali to eat something as she was about to faint.
 
 Vikram tells Anjali that she shouldn't have come to the party if she wasn't well. He asks her to apologize to Saroj.
