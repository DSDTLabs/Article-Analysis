HYDERABAD: Two days after a watchman of an apartment in Bowenpally allegedly set   on fire, the police are yet to take him into custody. While the  ,   claim that such heinous acts aren't new.

 The paltry sums imposed as fines, activists say, fail to act as a deterrent ensuring that offenders repeat their crimes. In fact, an offence committed for the first time under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960 attracts a fine of a meagre Rs 10.
 
 “When the government has been looking to increase fines for traffic violations and other crimes, why is it that there has been no increase in the fines imposed for animal cruelty?
 
 With a measly fine of Rs 10, for the first offence and Rs 50 for the second offence, we cannot bring about a change,“ said a member of the animal rights' group  , Navamita Mukherjee.
 
 When contacted about the incident that is believed to have occured on Monday, officials from the Bowenpally police station said that they had only recorded the statement of the watchman responsible for burning the puppies. “Once we get the post-mortem reports, we will take action against the accused,“ a police official said.
 
 While one of the stray puppies died on the spot, according to sources, the other sustained severe burns and succumbed later. Sources said the watchman knew that the puppies were at a particular location and in spite of this, went on to burn bushes in the area. The mother of the puppies is said to have survived the incident.
 
 Shedding light on the gravity of the situation, activists say that in the last year itself several cases of cruelty towards animals emerged from the city.
