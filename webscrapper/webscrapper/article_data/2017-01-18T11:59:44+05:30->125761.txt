There are also questionnaire regarding the city’s civic amenities and people could give marks for that.
 
 Problems like lack of water in public toilets, cleaning of public toilets and absence of vehicles for picking up garbage or garbage lying on the road, dustbins not cleared and disposal of dead animals could be uploaded through this App with the location marked and that would automatically get forwarded to the civic body concerned.
