Trichy: Five India Post payments banks (IPBB) are to come up in head post offices in the central postal region soon. Head post offices in Trichy, Thanjavur, Karur, Pudukottai and Cuddalore will have the payment banks in the first phase, officials said. 

 These banks will encourage small entrepreneurs and create saving habits among villagers too. Customers can open a savings account with the banks by depositing a meagre amount of Rs 100 and a maximum of Rs 1 lakh.
 
 Meanwhile, the department has mobilised Rs 174 crore as deposit under the Sukanya Samriddhi scheme from 38,350 customers during 2016-17 from across the central region, they added. The department has so far collected Rs 49.50 crore from 8,439 customers in three months from April 1 to June 30 during the current financial year, they further stated.
 
 Earlier, postmaster general D Veena Kumari inaugurated a centre for updation of   cards for existing card holders at the head post office here on Monday. 
 
 Postal department in collaboration with UIDAI has launched the service, as there is a huge demand from public to keep their Aadhaar information updated in the database which includes correction in names, change in address, change in photographs and change in mobile numbers, said the postmaster general. 
 
 Since the facilities to register biometric identification was not provided, new enrolment of Aadhaar would be done later, once the required equipment is provided, she said. 
 
 Public would be charged Rs 20 for updation work and Rs 25 for colour print and Rs 10 in the case of black and white print, a senior official added.
