KOLHAPUR: The citizens have demanded Kolhapur-Pune intercity   on a daily basis that will help reduce dependability of passengers on road transport.

 Being an important district in western Maharashtra, Kolhapur’s location has kept it aside from mainstream rail network. A single and non-electrified track has slowed down train traffic to Kolhapur. Hence, activists demanded a new daily intercity train from Kolhapur to Pune.
 
 Shivnath Biyani, member of central zonal   users’ consultative committee, said, “We have been demanding direct connectivity with Pune. Currently, to reach Pune, people heavily depend on Mumbai-bound trains. They also rely on road transport that is risky and unaffordable. Thus, we have demanded daily intercity rail service between the two cities. Many people from the city have settled in Pune for various purposes and depend on road transport. The train travel is comfortable and within economic reach.”
 
 Samir Seth, another member of the committee, said, “We have been demanding this new train service for the past many years. I even proposed this subject during the zonal meeting held earlier this month. The officials in the central zone promised to put this proposal before the railway board. But we are skeptical about their seriousness. Hence, we have decided to follow up the status of our demand every month.”
 
 Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament Chhatrapati   said, “I held talks with railway officials and they were positive about our demand for a new service. I will hold discussion with the railway minister soon to give a push to this service and other railway-related works. We are expecting the train service to connect Kolhapur and Pune.”
