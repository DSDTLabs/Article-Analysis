 They have been identified as Vipin, Ajith and Thulasidas alias Sreejith. The trio are first, second and third accused in the house attack incident which led to the suicide of Vasudevan on April 6. The court remanded them in judicial custody.
 
 "S R Sreejith was arrested after being mistaken for Thulasidas alias Sreejith. We had arrested 10 people in connection with gang attack on the house of Vasudevan who later committed suicide. Out of the 10, one was released as he had no connection with the case and another (S R Sreejith) died. The remaining eight are now out on bail. We suspect two of them are involved in the house attack case," said a senior police officer.   later died in a city hospital April 9, following alleged custodial torture by police.
 
 The special investigation team which is probing into the death of Sreejith has moved a petition in the court for getting the three into custody. 
 
 Meanwhile, an investigation team headed to Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday to probe into the anonymous letter received by Sreejith's family on Friday. The letter threatens the family of dire consequences if they don't withdraw their complaint in the case.
