Mahesh Babu, Rakul Preet and AR Murugadoss’ ‘Spyder’ releases tomorrow and ahead of it, Prince Mahesh revealed a secret that might disappoint fans. 

 He tried to clear any misunderstandings created by the teaser of the film where a robotic spider crawls up his shoulder and he can be seen hushing it. Turns out, the robotic spider was created just for the promo and will have absolutely no role to play in the film!
 
 Many believed that the robotic spider will be crucial to the film, so Mahesh clarified that it will not feature in the film at all. Reports state that he said that he was making the clarification because he did not want the audience to be confused and disappointed upon not finding it in the film. 
 
 He also reportedly revealed that several other exciting elements have been kept under wraps to let the audience experience them first hand. He also promised that ‘Spyder’ would be an edge of the seat thriller. 
 
 Guess we’ll find out tomorrow if it is or isn’t right?
