BENGALURU:   said it will delist its American Depositary Shares (ADS) from the   London and Euronext Paris Exchanges due to low average daily trading volumes, a move that will leave the company listed in only one overseas exchange.

 
 India’s second largest software services provider by revenue is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange ( ) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) in the country, as also in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), where it has been trading since 2012. It was the first Indian IT services firm to be listed on the Nasdaq, in 1999. In 2012-13, it delisted from Nasdaq and moved to   and Euronext London and Euronext Paris. Infosys had then said that the Euronext listings were because Europe was home to many of its investors, clients and employees. 
 
 “During the 5-year period of the company’s listing on Euronext Paris and Euronext London, the average daily trading volume of the company’s ADS was significantly lower than its average daily trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),” the company said on Monday.
 
 While the volumes at NYSE has been historically high, with daily average of more than 2 million ADRs changing hands regularly this month, it has been abysmally low in the two European exchanges, with a few thousands on an average, which is not commensurate with the related administrative requirements.
 
 “A sales facility will be provided by the company to the holders of ADS trading on the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges. ADS holders, who opt for the sales facility will be able to sell their ADS on the NYSE in accordance with Euronext Paris and Euronext London rules. ADS holders who do not opt for the sales facility can continue to keep their ADS and will be able to trade their ADS on the NYSE,” Infosys added.
