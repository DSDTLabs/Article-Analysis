AHMEDABAD:   (RBI) governor,   on Wednesday called ‘Make in India’, the flagship programme of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union government, an “old idea”, emphasizing the need for adequate infrastructure for it to succeed.

 “The idea of Make In India for India is an old idea. What you really want is that the environment in India is so good that others also come to India and make goods not only for India but also for the rest of the world,” Rangarajan said, while speaking on ‘Changing Contours of Globalization’ at   (AU) in the city on Wednesday.
 
 “If Make In India is to succeed, the critical point is how good is our infrastructure, how cost effective as a country we are, and that is where our focus will be. The slogan has to be translated with effective infrastructure support,” added Rangarajan.
 
 Rangarajan also called for the government to address slowing economic growth over the last few years, and said Make In India may be one way to do that.
 
 “India’s economic growth has slowed down. We had a growth rate averaging between 8-9% for six-seven years, and today we are talking about a growth rate of 7% or 6.7%. That way our economic growth is slowing,” he said.
 
 “We need to address this. Make In India is one aspect of that, mainly that you produce effectively to meet the needs of India. One important point here is that when you make goods for the world, you automatically become efficient and quality conscious,” he said.
