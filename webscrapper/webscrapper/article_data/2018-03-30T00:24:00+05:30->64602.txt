New Delhi: On the seventh day of his   at Ramlila Maidan on Thursday, anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare ended it after meeting Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis but threatened to return in September if the Centre doesn’t act on its promises by August. 

 Anna claimed that he had been assured by the Union government that appointments of a lokpal at the Centre and lokayuktas in the states would be made soon. According to a member of his core committee, Sanjay Patade, the Centre has agreed to all nine demands of the octogenarian while seeking some time to execute them. 
 
 Anna said, “They have assured us that they will make the appointments as soon as possible. I will see till August or will begin again in September. It should be done within a time frame. CM Fadnavis has said it will not take even six months, we will see.” 
 
 His demands include giving better prices to the farmers for their yield, pension to farmers above 60 years, autonomy and constitutional status to the krishi mulya ayog. As electoral reforms, he was demanding the rights to reject and recall and the picture of every candidate as his poll symbol to help illiterate voters. 
 
 “The government and the public are not separate. The government’s job is to do what is good for the people and the country. Things should not come to such a pass that protests are needed,” said the activist.
 
 On Monday, the central government reached out to Anna through Maharashtra minister Girish Mahajana. 
 
 Patade said the PMO had assured in writing that the demands would be acted upon. “A committee will be set up on farmers’ issues. On electoral reforms, the government will ask the Election Commission to act on the demands.” 
 
 Meanwhile, a man hurled a shoe towards the stage where Anna, Fadnavis and Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat were present.
