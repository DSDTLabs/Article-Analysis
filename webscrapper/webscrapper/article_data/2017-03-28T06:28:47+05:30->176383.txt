AURANGABAD: Residents of Vishtanti Nagar on Monday staged a dharna on the premises of the civic body’s main administrative building over erratic water supply in their locality.

 The residents, mostly women, also gheraoed   (AMC) commissioner Om Prakash Bakoria’s office and demanded regular water supply in their area.
 
 As the locality is situated in Gunthewari area, there is no network of internal pipeline. Thus, the municipal authorities supply water through tankers for which the residents have to shell out Rs 1,100 for every three month.
 
 “The AMC supplies only 200 liter water per family in three days. However, what irked the residents is the failure on the part of the municipal authorities to supply water as per the schedule. On many occasions, we miss our turn and are forced to wait for 5-6 days. It is very frustrating especially during the summer,” said  , one of the agitators.
 
 Another resident,  , said that as the mercury level is going up every passing day, water scarcity is taking its toll. “For one of the other reason, the tankers operators skip the supply and people have to buy water from private suppliers,” she said.
 
 The residents also expressed concerns over the municipal body’s recent move of inflating water charges for tankers. “They recently hiked the rates from Rs 900 per quarter to Rs 1,100 per quarter without making any improvement in the supply. People will not hesitate to pay more if they get enough water. But the ground reality is different. Every time the residents have to spend long hours waiting for water,” Suradkar said.
 
 Meanwhile, Bakoria played the old tune saying the civic body would improve the system soon. About 40% of the city’s residential area comes under Gunthewari where in the municipal body is supplying water through tankers.
