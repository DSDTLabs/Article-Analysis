HYDERABAD: Seven years after implementation of the Right to Education Act, the Comptroller and Auditor General report said 45% government schools in   continue to function without school building, toilets, kitchen and mid-day meals. "45% of schools were however, allowed to continue to function in violation of the provisions of the Act. Despite the lapse of seven years since implementation of RTE Act, a large number of schools were deficient with regard to provision of basic infrastructural facilities/amenities," read the   report. 

 The   (C&DSE) records show 21,547 of 28,606 government and local body schools don't have ramps and handrails, 12,768 schools do not have playground and 11,028 do not have boundary wall or fencing. There are several other schools which don't have toilets, kitchen where mid-day-meal is cooked, library, room for every teacher and an office-cum-store.
 
 Scrutiny of records further revealed the time frame of three years for completion of various infrastructural facilities such as school buildings, toilets, drinking water facilities had not been adhered to. "Out of 91,199 sanctioned civil works during 2001-02 to 2016-17, an aggregate of 21,564 works (24 percent) remained incomplete, of which 7,014 works relating to toilets and drinking water were in progress (March 2017)," read the report. 
 
 The government attributed the non-completion of works to shortage of funds. The CAG recommended the government to review all infrastructure plans to ensure completion of pending works within reasonable time. The CAG further found that little efforts were made by the government in setting up of new schools which resulted in dependency on and flourishing of private schools across the state.
