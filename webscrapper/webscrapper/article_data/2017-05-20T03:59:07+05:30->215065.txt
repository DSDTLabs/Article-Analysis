DEHRADUN: The   government is set to approach the Supreme Court to “put forth its view” on the state high court’s decision to grant living status to Ganga and  , citing “technical, geographical and administrative issues” with implementation of the order as the river flows through five states.

 Urban development minister and spokesperson of the state government Madan Kaushik told TOI that the Uttarakhand government has written a letter to the Centre to seek its permission to approach the Supreme Court. 
 
 In a landmark judgment on March 20 this year, the Uttarakhand high court accorded the status of “living human entities” to Ganga and Yamuna, two of India’s most sacred rivers. Talking to TOI, Kaushik said, “Let me be very clear that we are not against according of living entity status to the two holy rivers Ganga and Yamuna. 
 
 But while according the legal status of living humans to Ganga and Yamuna, the high court has named chief secretary of Uttarakhand, Namami Gange director and advocate general of the state the legal parents of the two rivers. How can the chief secretary here be held accountable if the river is polluted in West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand or UP?” Kaushik added, “We just want an opportunity to put forth our views in the apex court.”
