AMBALA: Haryana agriculture and farmers’ welfare minister   said that the state’s claim on Sutlej-Yamuna-Link (SYL) canal is legally strong and INLD’s threat to prevent entry of Punjab vehicles into Haryana will not only dent the claim but also spoil the peaceful atmosphere in the state. 

 Dhankar described the INLD call as a mere ‘show-off’ and said it would help achieve nothing. He said the INLD was raking the issue to keep itself politically relevant. He was addressing a gathering at the   Samaroh in Gurugram on Sunday
