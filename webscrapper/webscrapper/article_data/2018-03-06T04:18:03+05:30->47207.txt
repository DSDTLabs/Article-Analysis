 “The   had called us for an inter-hall administration meeting on January 17 where we were told about a possible hike in hostel facilities like guest and mess admission charges; fine on late payments and a hike on certain food items,” said Simone Zoya Khan, JNU student union vice-president. But, she said, the students had objected to the proposal and requested the administration to set up a special committee with a JNUSU member and a hostel president as representatives before taking any such decision. “But just like in the past, they have gone ahead with their decision.” 
 
 This notification, dated February 27, states that the revised changes will be charged from January 1. 
 
 JNUSU president Geeta Kumari said the minutes of the meeting had not been released yet and it is “an autocratic decision”. 
 
 This notification comes only a few weeks after a decision to introduce compulsory attendance was opposed by students and teachers, leading to protests and strikes in the campus.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, the JNU administration did not respond.
