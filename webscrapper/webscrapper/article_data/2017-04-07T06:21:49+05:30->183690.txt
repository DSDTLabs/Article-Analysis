AHMEDABAD: Soon after graduating, the B Tech Class of 2016 of   (IIT-Gn), has volunteered to support their   and their juniors. 

 The 2016   has set up an endowment fund to create the "Class-of-2016 Scholarship", an award for meritorious students in the institute. Out of the batch of about 115 students, 30 students are actively donating to the endowment fund on a monthly basis, said officials at IIT-Gn.
 
 The first "Class-of-2016 Scholarship" has been awarded to Danish Mansoor. He will receive the scholarship of Rs 2,000 per month for ten months.
 
 The alumni have decided to keep donors anonymous for the moment. A student coordinator of the batch, Yash Pratap Singh said, "The BTech Class has decided to keep donors and donated amounts confidential so that those who intend to donate but haven't done it yet, do not feel left out."
 
 IIT-Gn Director, professor  , said, "It is heartening that our freshly-minted alumni have started to make regular donations to IIT Gandhinagar. More than the donation, I am glad to see the spirit of our alumni, their developing bond with the institute, and look forward to a continued association."
 
 IIT-Gn has more than 750 alumni at the moment and about 10% of them are already donating to the institute for various causes.
 
 Faculty coordinator, Office of Alumni Relations at IIT-Gn, Professor  , said the relationship between an educational institute and its alumni is a two-way thing. "The success of an institute impacts the alumni, and the success of alumni defines the institute," he said.
 
 There are many personal stories of students from the batch who are contributing towards the endowment fund. One student from the batch, who was from a remote village of India, got various opportunities at IIT-Gn including personality development workshops and international exposure. Empowered by these experiences, the student is now well-placed, and has committed a monthly contribution to the fund in gratitude.
