LUCKNOW: UP tourism minister  , who had defected from   after a two-decade stint to join the BJP ahead of 2017 polls, on Monday ridiculed the re-alignment of political parties in the state, saying the trio of Mayawati,   and Akhilesh Yadav suffer from “fat ego” and can’t co-exist and fight any election as united opposition.

 Joshi also launched a direct attack on the Congress , saying that the party needed “people of substance and not choice”.
 
 She was reacting to the senior   leader Naresh Agarwal’s induction into the BJP as well as saffron party’s last-minute bid to have an extra   MP.
 
 “I think all the cadres of Congress and SP are running away. Whoever wants development is now aligning with the BJP,”said Joshi.
 
 Joshi said that the marriage between SP and Congress ended because of the ego clashes between Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi.
 
 “Both of these leaders, and even Mayawatiji, like to have their presence and have big egos. Besides, their vote bank is also divergent. Even if the BSP and SP come together, that will cut no ice with electorate,” said Joshi.
 
 The minister, who had nurtured Congress functioning in Allahabad for nearly two decades, said it was obvious that Congress, Telanagna Rashtra Samiti (TRS) and SP are now running to either drum up support for a Third Front or seek solidarity with the West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, because they have realised their votebank has diminished. “Like me, Mamata was humiliated by the Congress and so she left them. They did not give her the respect she deserved. Today, they have realised her potential. And the way they have sought support for Abhishek Manu Singhvi's nomnination in the Rajya Sabha, it’s obvious they want to realise the Mahagatbandhan dream,” she said.
 
 She, however, said that the BJP would not resort to anything unlawful to have an additional MP in UP.
