SURAT: Judicial Magistrate First Class ( ) on Friday rejected the plea of   police who had requested for 12-day remand of the accused arrested in Sheetal Desai murder case. Judge Chaudhary sent the accused Jayesh Babu  , a plumber, to civil hospital for his complete medical examination after he alleged that he was badly beaten up by the police in custody and also given electric shocks to make him confess to the crime that he had not committed. 

 Police had arrested Halpati on July 20 on the charge of murdering Sheetal Desai, a resident of 71 Sarvodaya Society in Navsari town, on July 12. Police claimed that the accused killed the housewife as she had refused to pay him Rs 300 extra for repairing the geyser in the bathroom of her house. 
 
 The judge talked to Halpati when he was produced in his chamber in the evening. Navsari police said the accused had given false information to them about his whereabouts on the day of the incident and that they had not tortured him at all. Police inspector   said, "We will approach the sessions court on Saturday to get the remand of the accused."
