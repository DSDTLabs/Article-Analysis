MEERUT: The interfaith couple at the centre of a raging “love Jihad” row in   has approached Allahabad high court seeking protection, even as district police has registered an attempt to murder case against the youth for allegedly shooting at the brother of the woman.
 
  Police also said on Saturday that the youth was a criminal with over half-a-dozen cases of attempt to murder, loot and robbery registered against him.
  
  On April 8, the woman was allegedly kidnapped by the youth and his aides while she was returning to her in-laws’ home after marriage from her native place in Meerut's   village. A case of abduction was later registered against the youth at   police station.
  
  The village of the woman was tense since the alleged abduction and right wing groups have termed it a case of “love Jihad". According to sources in police, the woman was having an affair with the youth of the other community and she was married against her wishes.
  
  On May 17, brother of the abducted woman, who was allegedly being threatened for approaching police in the abduction case, was shot at by some assailants. The youth was named as the main accused in the case, and he was booked for attempt to murder.
  
  Now, police on Saturday said that the couple has approached high court for protection.
  
  Meanwhile, local residents alleged that police were “inactive” in the matter.
  
  “We held several rounds of panchayat in our village to resolve the issue. But local police was not showing interest. Now, it has completely given up as the matter has gone to court,” Jai Singh, Aitmadpur village pradhan, told TOI.
