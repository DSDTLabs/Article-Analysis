Chandigarh: A fact-finding committee chaired by former judge, Punjab and Haryana high court Justice J S Narang submitted an interim report of the fire incident, which took place on May 17, in administrative block to Panjab University vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar Grover on Thursday. The report submitted will be tabled in the upcoming syndicate meeting on September 23. 

 The Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) report stated that the over-drawing of electric current by an appliance resulted into short-circuit and caused the fire that engulfed a portion of the administrative block of Panjab University on the intervening night of May 13 and 14. 
 
 Pointing out the flaws, the 11-page report stated that the action-time delay, non-functioning of the fire alarm system, lack of proper guarding at night and lack of preparedness to meet such disasters were also apparent and needed to be taken care of. The report stated that had the fire occurred in the daytime, losses would have been minimum.
