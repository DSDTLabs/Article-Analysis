SHIMLA:   rain and snow, coupled with depleting water sources, has set alarm bells ringing in   as drought like situation is being witnessed in peak winter months. Chief minister Jai Ram   said the state could face acute shortage of water due to lack of snow and rain this year and asked the irrigation and public health department to prepare a plan well in advance.

 Thakur said water supply schemes could be hit if the climatic conditions persist for a few more weeks. While presiding over a review meeting of irrigation and public health department along with minister Mahendar Thakur in   on Monday, the CM said his department should explore the possibilities of installing more handpumps or be prepared with water tankers if it doesn’t rain or snow. 
 
 “Due to changing climatic conditions, we constantly need to chlorinate and clean the water reservoirs and also the traditional water resources,” he said. If any jaundice cases were reported from any particular area, the department should immediately check the source of water supply and take effective measures to control the outbreak of jaundice, he told officials.
 
 Irrigation and public health minister   said that considering water shortage, rain water would be collected for which financial help would be sought from BRICS Development Bank. He said the bank would be arriving in Shimla on Tuesday and a presentation on collecting rain water would be made before them.
