CHENNAI: An order would soon be issued to give sale deeds to 42,000 families living in slum clearance tenements across 11 districts, said deputy chief minister O   in the assembly on Friday. He said in many tenements, the original owners were not available. The dwelling units had changed hands at least 6 to 7 times, he said.

 As the government would not be able to find the original owner of the tenements, a new order would be issued in the coming months to issue sale deeds, said  .
 
 The issue was raised by Chengelpet DMK MLA M   during question hour. She said many people, who had fully paid for the tenements, were yet to get pattas. The deputy chief minister said steps would be taken to give the deeds as early as possible.
