IMPHAL: The first round of dialogue between the Churachandpur-based   (JAC) against ' ' and the state government here on Friday yielded a   

 About 65 km from Imphal,   dominated Churachandpur has been on the boil since the assembly passed three bills to protect the indigenous people of the state on August 31, 2015. Terming the statutes as anti tribal, Churachandpur denizens launched a violent protest in which nine agitators were killed, six in police firing. Eight bodies of the protesters are still lying unclaimed in the mortuary of Churachanpur District Hospital.
 
 Of the three bills, the President withheld the 'Protection of Manipur People's (PMP) Bill 2015'. The 'Manipur Land Reform and Land Revenue (Seventh Amendment) Bill, 2015 and 'The Shops and Establishment (2nd Amendment)Bill, 2015' were put under examination by experts for reasonable conclusion. 
 
 During Friday's talks, Biren expressed his desire to let the families of those whose bodies are still lying in the mortuary perform their last rites, said a statement issued by Manipur information and public relations department. Stating that there is no country/state or even a family without any problem, the CM said any problem can be resolved through dialogue.
 
 Biren appealed to the JAC and the people of Churachandpur to come to the negotiating table and said the government is ready to hold talks for resolving any issue, added the statement.
