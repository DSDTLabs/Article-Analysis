Pune: Four masked men barged into the office of a newly elected   at Shivane and made away with Rs 2 lakh after beating up his 25-year-old   on Sunday afternoon.

 Shantanu Balasaheb Mokashi has lodged the complaint against the suspects, who have been booked under section 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) of the Indian Penal Code.

 Before leaving, the suspects took the recorder of the CCTV cameras installed in the office. “The complainant has identified one of the suspects. We have launched a manhunt for him,” the officer said.
