NEW DELHI: Assistant sub-inspector Vijay Singh (46)— who was one of the three victims of the   in west Delhi’s   on Sunday — was promoted barely three months ago. Singh’s family members said they had feared a tragic end for him, considering that their request for additional security had been turned down. 

 Singh was a PSO to gangster   alias Bhupender, who was among those killed on Sunday. The ASI is survived by his wife and two sons, Ravi (24) and Chandresh (18), who live in their ancestral home in Sagarpur.
 
 Sunil, Singh’s wife, told TOI that she last spoke to him at 10 pm. Singh told her that he was accompanying Dariyapur who wanted to meet a friend and would be back in a couple of hours. She said: “Vijay was not happy with his job. A lot of things played on his mind and he was always worried.” Though he often returned home after 20 hours of work and go to bed immediately, he never complained, she said. 
 
 Family members alleged that Singh was not even given a bulletproof jacket. “Despite fears that Dariyapur could be attacked any time and my husband could get caught in the crossfire, he wasn’t given additional security,” Sunil said. 
 
 Singh’s younger son, Chandresh, said: “Most of the time, my father was overworked. But on days when he was free, he would take us out on long drives. These occasions didn’t come too often.”
 
 Chandresh said on Sunday his father dropped him at his college at 7.30am (for some function) and left for work. “We made plans to go for a movie later in the day,” he said. “My father was the only earning member of the family. I now plan to quit my studies and start working,” said Ravi, the elder son. 
 
 The family said that they would shift to a different house soon.
