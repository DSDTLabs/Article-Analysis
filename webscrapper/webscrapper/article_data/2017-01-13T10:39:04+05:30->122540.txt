BHUBANESWAR: Come Saturday and the state capital will host the first monthly musical soiree with two santoor and tabla virtuosos confirming their participation in the event.

 Sources in the   (BDA) said santoor player Pt.   and tabla maestro   will perform at the   here. The show, which is free for all, will start at 6pm. 
 
 National and internationally-acclaimed artists will be invited on the second Saturday of every month to put up a performance here. "We have been taking a host of initiatives to make people's lives stress-free, especially after Bhubaneswar was accorded a 'Smart City' status. The music show boasts of two weekly programmes, Ekamra walk and Patha Utsav. The latter is a street festival organized at Janpath on Sunday," said a BDA official.
 
 The authorities zeroed in on Indira Gandhi Park as the venue for the event because of its central location. This park is likely to witness a higher footfall in the future. 
 
 The BDA has roped in multiple sponsors to organize the show, but the power of selecting the artists, the stage design and other stage paraphernalia lies with it. The move aims to re-instil the love for music in people, said a spokesperson for BDA. 
 
 In future, the BDA may hire an event management agency for a hassle-free show that will reduce the burden of its officials. T
 
 The civic body is also planning to hold art exhibitions in Ekemra Kshetra ( ) to revive the state's traditional art forms.
