BHOPAL: Students of a private medical   have alleged that they were beaten up by the administrative staff. They claimed that action came after they protested against the arbitrary demand to pay an additional fee amount of Rs 4 lakh. 

 Incidentally, complaints to directorate of medical education (DME) and Admission and   ( ), MP, have not provided any relief to students.
 
 First year students of Kolar-based Advance   (AIMS) alleged that college administration was exerting pressure them to pay additional about Rs 4 lakh besides the AFRC-recommended annual fee of Rs 5 lakh. College said that additional fee was for library, infrastructure, hostel, mess and cultural activities. The first complaint was registered in July. Both DME and AFRC officials admitted that complaints have been received. 
 
 However, when it came to taking action, both passed the buck to each other. Some 150 students have been on strike for almost a week. "Some parents and students met college administration. After we demanded a receipt for additional payment, students were threatened and roughed up," alleged an MBBS student. "We have approached DME and AFRC to intervene," he added.
 
 AFRC has fixed Rs 5 lakh annual fee for private medical college. With situation worsening, many students reached Bhopal. An AFRC official said, "Notice has been served on the college. However, taking any action falls under jurisdiction of DME." "We are analysing situation but any action has to be initiated by AFRC," said a DME official.
