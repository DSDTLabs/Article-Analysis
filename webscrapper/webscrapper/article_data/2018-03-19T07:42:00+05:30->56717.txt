JALANDHAR: Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee (DSGMC), which is controlled by   (SAD), reacted strongly to the sentence pronounced on   in the case of assassination of Punjab chief minister   Singh. The committee juxtaposed it with the failure of the justice delivery system to punish culprits of violence against   in November, 1984.

 In a statement issued on Saturday, DSGMC president Manjit Singh GK, who heads SAD’s Delhi unit, sought to draw a contrast between the swiftness used against Tara and the failure of CBI and judicial delivery system in prosecuting and punishing those who murdered of thousands of Sikhs in Delhi in November 1984.
 
 “CBI and justice delivery systems act very swiftly when cases are against Sikhs but where does this swiftness disappear when Sikhs are victims and cases and complaints are against people like Sajjan Kumar, Jagdish Tytler and   - alleged perpetrators of violence against Sikhs. Crucial witness against Tytler, Abhishek Verma has been expressing willingness before CBI to undergo a lie detector test but the CBI, which has given a clean chit to Tytler thrice, fails to get his lie detector test conducted. The same CBI acts with eagle eye against Tara,” Manjit Singh GK said.
 
 According to him, the CBI, which failed to get a single culprit convicted for murder, robbery and rape, acts with double energy against Sikhs. It will be a sad day when Sikhs will have to cross the constitutional line for justice. Central agencies should stop treating Sikhs like second rate citizens,” he said.
