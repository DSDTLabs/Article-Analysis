AMRITSAR: Kirtan and classical music can soon become part of curriculum of schools and colleges of Canada’s   province after   of Maadho Music Kirtan Training Academy took up the matter with province’s ministry of education. The ministry has already announced to include Sikh heritage in schools’ curriculum.

The Sikh heritage curriculum is being prepared with the help of Sikh Heritage Museum of Canada and a few professional organizations, which could be introduced in primary schools by September.
 
 
 Brampton-based Ravinder, wife of tech tycoon and Datawind CEO Suneet Tuli, has partnered with California-based   Singh to launch Maadho Music Kirtan Training Academy, which teaches kirtan and classical music to young students from diverse cultures and ethnicities.

 “Our students are both in Canada and the US. We have decided to provide free training of kirtan to girls of the Bhai Dharam Singh Khalsa Charitable Trust, an orphanage which is home to over 250 girls, and give daswandh (one-tenth) of academy’s earning to pay for musical instruments and teachers,” said Ravinder, adding that they had already donated musical instruments and tablets required for training.
 
 To add, Suneet said he would donate tablets to girls and introduce them to different apps that teach the theory of classical music. “We are also setting up smart classrooms at the orphanage,” he said.
