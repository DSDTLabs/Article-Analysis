KOLKATA: Accident victim   was happy to be compensated with Rs 40,000 as her right hand had been fractured after being hit by a bike in April 2016. She was reimbursed at the civil court during National Lok Adalat organised by district legal services authority (DLSA), Kolkata. 

 But   who appeared in another motor accident claim case ( ) in the Lok Adalat was unhappy, as he was given Rs 3.10 lakh as compensation for his son's death. "I waited a decade to get this compensation, but the sum is meagre," said Singh.
 
 DLSA Kolkata secretary   said, "1.39 lakh traffic violation cases were disposed of and Rs 48.2 lakh fine was collected on Saturday. Further, 83 pre-litigation bank cases were settled along with 11 MACC."
 
 South 24-Parganas DLSA on Sunday disposed of 1.33 lakh traffic cases and collected fine around 65 lakh. Its secretary   said, "We settled 280 bank cases for which Rs 2.1 crore has been granted. Rs 10 lakh was awarded in six MACCs. Mukhopadhyay in November received the award for best DLSA in eastern India.
