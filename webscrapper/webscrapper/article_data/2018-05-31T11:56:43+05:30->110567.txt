Mirror had earlier reported (May 18) about Bhushan and   taking over the Shree Narayan Singh-directed socialdrama 'Batti Gul Meter Chalu' from Prernaa Arora. In April, the film’s shooting had come to an abrupt halt over alleged non-payment of dues. Now, we have learnt that the film’s leads,   and  , returned to Uttarakhand, where the film is set, to resume work on Wednesday after shooting some portions in Mumbai.

  
  
 A source from the film reveals, “Shahid and Shraddha will be shooting at Tehri and Dehradun for some important sequences till mid- June. After that they are to return to Mumbai to complete the last schedule. The duo is also scheduled to shoot a romantic number in Uttarakhand.” Shahid and Shraddha had shot a long schedule in Tehri in February.
 
 Yami Gautam, who plays a lawyer in the film along with Shahid, starts work on her portions after the team returns to Mumbai in June. Meanwhile, the actress has been attending sessions at the High Court in Churchgate as part of her prep.
 
 'Batti Gul…' is a social drama that deals with discrepancies of electricity billing in small towns. Shahid had earlier told Mirror, “It sounds cool but it’s very difficult to pull off. My character is a small-town lawyer, a regular bloke who fights for an issue with which so many people in our country are grappling — power cuts and outrageously high electricity bills.”
