 In an accompanying video released recently, Fadnavis has exhorted all 36 districts of the state to emulate the Morna project. Lauding the initiative,   said that the project demonstrated how a determined administration and public participation can do wonders. “The efforts taken by the local government and citizens is a matter of pride for our state, and I salute the citizens of Akola for creating history by reviving the heritage river,” said Fadnavis.
 
 The CM also mentioned how the initiative was appreciated by Prime Minister  , who got “magnetically drawn” towards the campaign after seeing a “striking photograph” of a grandson cleaning the river along with his grandfather. On the first day of the campaign, more than 7,000 citizens of Akola and over 100 NGOs had participated in the river cleaning drive. 
 
 Sharing the success story of his pet project   Yukta Shivar, Fadnavis said that protecting the environment is a priority for the state government. “The state has already taken lead in conserving JAL, Jameen and Jungle, and success of Morna river has added a new chapter in this endeavour. The initiative is also in line with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan,” added Fadnavis.
