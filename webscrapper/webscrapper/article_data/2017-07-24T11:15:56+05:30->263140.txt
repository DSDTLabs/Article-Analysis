PUNE: The Kondhwa police on Saturday arrested three persons, including two partners of a   company and the supervisor of the construction site in Kondhwa, for causing the death of a labourer on Friday due to negligence.

  (22) of Kondhwa died after he was trapped under the soil and mud when a portion of the hillock adjacent to the construction site caved in. The soil on the hillock had loosened due to heavy rain. Two labourers escaped with minor injuries. The police had registered a case of accidental death.
 
 A M Sonawane, assistant inspector of the Kondhwa police station, told TOI that the probe revealed the suspects had not provided any safety gadgets like a helmet to the labourers. “They were arrested under section 304 (A) (causing death due to negligence) of the Indian Penal Code. The trio was released on bail by the court,” Sonawane said.
 
 The probe has also revealed that the company has obtained permission for excavation and construction at the site. “They have furnished copies of the permissions to us,” Sonawane said.
