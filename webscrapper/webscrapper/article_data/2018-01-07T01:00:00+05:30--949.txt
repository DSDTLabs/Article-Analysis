 Ravish Desai and   are all set to pair up on screen for the second time. However, this outing is rather special as this is their first project together after their marriage in December 2016.

 The two first met on the set of their show ' ' and soon, love blossomed. After a courtship of two years, they tied the knot in 2016. And now, the asli biwi will join her hubby in the ongoing show ' ', in which he plays the male lead.
 
 Happy about the development, Ravish says, “It’s great to pair up with my wife as the chemistry is natural and we won’t have to work on it. The only oddity is to pretend to be mesmerised with her in the first scene. We have passed that phase in life (laughs).” Mugdha adds, “There couldn’t have been a better start to the new year. We have started shooting and it’s a lot of fun.” 
 
 Ask them who is the better actor among the two and she answers, “I have always believed that Ravish is a better actor than me. He is disciplined and natural. However, he never leaves a chance to pull my leg about my seniority.”
 
 That’s on the set, but who is the boss at home? “Situations choose the boss. However, it’s mostly her and it’s better that way,” Ravish laughs.
