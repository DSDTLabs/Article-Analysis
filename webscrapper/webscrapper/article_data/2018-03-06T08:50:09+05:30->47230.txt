 Speaking during the debate on the budget, Paresh Dhanani, leader of opposition in the state assembly, alleged that the BJP government has brought Gujarat to the verge of bankruptcy during its 22-year rule. “It gave no relief in taxes to the citizens but increased public debt manifold and spent huge money on paying interest on the debt,” he said, adding, “The state government in the budget has admitted that the debt will cross Rs 3 lakh crore next year.”
