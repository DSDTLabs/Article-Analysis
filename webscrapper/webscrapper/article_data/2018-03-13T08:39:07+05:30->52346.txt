SURAT: Police booked an unidentified person for alleged attempt to steal cash from a   on   in Udhna on Sunday. The closed circuit television footages show that the man succeeded in opening the front cover of ATM that had over Rs 70 lakh cash using a metal cutter,  

 The FIR was lodged following a complaint by   (38), an employee of the agency that maintains the ATMs. The theft was carried out between March 9 afternoon and March 10 evening. Police recovered some images from the   footage, but the face of the accused was not clear. They are waiting for the complete video in which the man is seen entering and breaking the ATM. 
 
 Police booked the accused under various Sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 380 (theft), 461 (dishonestly breaking open receptacle containing property), 427 (damage to property) and others.
 
 “Face of the man was uncovered. He also closed the shutter outside the ATM after entering. The noise of the metal cutter was not heard outside as the area remains noisy due to several operational textile weaving units,” the police said.
 
 Police said there was no alarm system or guard posted at the ATM unit. 
 
 “Repetitively such incidents are taking place, but the banks or maintenance agencies are not making full proof arrangements to prevent thefts. The ATMs should have at least alarm system that alerts cops or nearby residents about theft attempt,” the police added.
 
 “We are yet to identify the person since his face is not clearly visible in some images recovered. Once we get the video we will be able to identify the person,” the police said.
