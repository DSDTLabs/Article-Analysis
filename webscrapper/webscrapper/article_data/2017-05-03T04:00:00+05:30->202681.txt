Vadodara: The Kothi building that is based on Scottish architecture was built in 1922 and it has been designed on the lines of the Balmoral Castle in Scotland.

 The story goes that Queen Victoria, who used to stay in the castle, once invited Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad to stay there. Sayajirao accepted her invitation and stayed in the castle in 1887. He was completely impressed by the castle’s architecture and its grandness and hence he decided to build such structure back in Baroda.
 
 Sayajirao was very close to Queen Victoria and it is believed that she was highly impressed with the king’s intellect and considered him as her son. Sayajirao came back to Baroda and built the two-storied Kothi Building spread over 80,000 sq feet at the cost of Rs four lakh. It was also called the Seat of Power as most of the important decisions were taken here. 
 
 The Dewan of Baroda sat in 40-room building that had a dhara-sabha hall. And, the king too sat in a sprawling room here. It was designed by architect A H Coyle.
