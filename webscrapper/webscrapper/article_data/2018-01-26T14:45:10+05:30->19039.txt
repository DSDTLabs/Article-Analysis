 The   star said she has realised what parts she can and cannot play as a result of the Hollywood's unrealistic beauty standards. 
 
 "It's only now I'm starting to realise the characters that are available to me because of the way I look and the characters that aren't available to me. It's a very shallow industry," Maisie said in an interview.
 
 The 20-year-old actor also feels that it is time for different types of beauty to be showcased on screen. 
 
 "I don't look like someone who is cast in roles that are, well, sexualised. Don't get me wrong. I'm completely in awe of Hollywood's leading ladies," Maisie said. 
 
 "I love looking at those totally jaw-droppingly beautiful women. But I think it's sad that you only get to see one type of beautiful on-screen," she added.
