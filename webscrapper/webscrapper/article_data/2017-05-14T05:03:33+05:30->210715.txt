JAMMU: Two civilians, including a 13-year-old visiting her grandparents, were killed and seven people injured on Saturday as Pakistan violated the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) for the second time in three days, unleashing heavy firing and shelling on the   sector of   district early in the morning.

 In view of the ceasefire violations, the district administration has indefinitely closed all schools in areas along the LoC and evacuated the villagers to relief camps set up at safer locations.

 “Pakistan   initiated indiscriminate firing by small arms, automatics and mortars from 0715 hours along the Line of Control (LC) in Nowshera sector,” defence spokesperson (Jammu) said. He said the   “retaliated strongly and effectively”.
 
 Deputy commissioner (Rajouri) Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said the family caught in the firing lived in Jhangar village.
 
 Police sources said four soldiers of the 48 RR were among those injured in the crossborder firing, but the Army was yet to confirm it by Saturday evening.
 
 Official sources said all schools in the Nowshera sector and adjoining areas along the LoC had been ordered closed for an indefinite period. “About 270 people from various villages have been shifted to camps established by the district administration. 
 
 While three camps have been made operational, 28 others have been notified,” Choudhary said.
