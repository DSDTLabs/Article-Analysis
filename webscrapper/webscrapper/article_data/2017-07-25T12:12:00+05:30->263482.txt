 Protestors also tried to gherao the state secretariat. Led by CPM leaders Rakesh Singha and Sanjay Chauhan, a delegation later submitted a memorandum to state chief secretary V C Pharka demanding that the statement of Mamta, wife of Suraj should be recorded immediately before the judicial magistrate.
