PATNA: The Centre for   (CEER) at   (IIT-P) is going to conduct a three-day course on ‘Earthquake resistant designs based on recently revised seismic code’ from April 5 for engineering students, academics, government and industries engineers. The online registration for the course can be done from March 12 to 17 on its official website www.iitp.ac.in.

 Officials said the course content comprises basic concept of earthquake engineering, behaviour of structures in past earthquakes and earthquake resistant design of the foundations and seismic design among others.
 
 “The course is aimed to abreast the participants with fundamentals of seismic design procedures focusing on the newly introduced clauses in the recently revised codes of practice. Earthquakes have caused vast devastation of infrastructure systems and facilities and have exposed the deficiencies in the existing design and construction practices. The participants will have a better understanding about the seismic design procedure, the impact of the recently revised Indian seismic code IS 1893 and IS 13920 on the design of RC buildings. They will get a better appreciation of various construction details with respect to seismic response,” said Dr  , one of the organizing faculty members.
 
  from IIT-Guwahati will be one of the faculty members of the course, while others from IIT-P include Prof Vaibhav Singhal, Prof Koushik Roy, Prof Avik Samanta, Prof Amarnath Hegde, Prof Pradipta Chakrabortty, Prof Ritwik Ghoshal, Prof Syed KK and Prof Ramkrishna Bag.
