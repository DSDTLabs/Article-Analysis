Visakhapatnam: The dip in prices of jaggery in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka has shown its impact on Anakapalli’s jaggery market in Visakhapatnam district as the second biggest jaggery market in the country is witnessing dip in sales.

 Sugarcane crop suffered a dip in the yield and a majority of the famers had preferred to supply sugarcane to factories which, analysts said, has shown impact on the making of jaggery. According to a trader in Anakapalli, Kandregula Satyanarayana, a majority of businessmen from West Bengal, Odisha and Bihar place orders from Anakapalli NTR jaggery market. “But now, they are giving priority to UP and Maharashtra markets because of low prices when compared to Anakapalli market,” he said.
 
 “The first quality jaggery is priced at Rs 2,400 for 100 kg in Maharashtra and Rs 2m200 in Uttar Pradesh whereas the same kind of jaggery here is Rs 3,100. The difference of price is Rs 600 to Rs 800. Traders of other states which are traditional buyers of Anakapalli market are now placing orders at UP or Maharashtra,” one of the businessmen of the jaggery market P Raghu said. He added that the farmers are not sending the jaggery lumps to the market after dip in prices.
 
 Not only this, Anakapalli jaggery lumps are in between 15 kg to 17 kg whereas UP, Karnataka and Maharashtra have been manufacturing smaller lumps. When the crop infections or fungal infections were showed their impact, farmers of Yalamanchili, Madugula and Chodavaram Assembly Constituency limits are now transporting the sugarcane to sugar factories. “This has shown impact on jaggery making and also reducing the volume,” trader Malla Satyanarayana told TOI.
 
 He further said that usually the market witnesses around 30,000 lumps everyday in January and February months because of festival season and also marriages season. But now the volume has not crossed 20,000 lumps a day so far.
