BHUBANESWAR: The   (NGT) reprimanded   and Chhattisgarh for failing to depose before the tribunal on Thursday for hearing in the Mahanadi water dispute. 

 The NGT made the comment when it found respondents from two states absent during the hearing of a petition filed by social campaigner  . The tribunal warned of strict action against the states if they fail to depose on April 10, the next date of hearing. 
 
 Two respondents - Union ministry of water resources and ministry of environment and forests - appeared before the tribunal. 
 
 Das filed the petition on January 30 stating that a large number of projects have been built and approved in Chhattisgarh on the Mahanadi. 
 
 Environment clearances have been granted by the Chhattisgarh State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF) without considering either the cumulative impact or impact on the downstream population, said the petitioner. 
 
 He has approached the tribunal to take steps for restoration of the river through release of water in quantity and quality that can meet the requirements of the downstream users in Odisha. Diversion of water involves significant ecological and social consequences due to the decline in the quality and quantity of water of the river, he added. 
 
 He prayed to the NGT that no new projects, which are dependent on the upper part of Mahanadi in Chhattisgarh, can come up unless compulsory public hearing is conducted with the downstream population of such project likely to be affected by diversion/consumption. 
 
 The petitioner expressed concern over the decline in the inflow of water to the Hirakud dam. State water resources secretary   refused to comment on this. "I will not comment on this issue," he added.
