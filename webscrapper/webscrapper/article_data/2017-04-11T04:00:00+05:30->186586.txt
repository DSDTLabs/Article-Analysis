Mumbai: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( ) has written to the government seeking an increase in the   age of its members. The regulator has sought an age limit in line with what is applicable for whole-time members of the Securities and Exchanges Board of India ( ).

 IRDAI had advertised for filling up the positions of member-distribution and member-finance. According to sources, there have been around 20 applications for each position. Although, chairmen of public sector banks have applied for the post, they are close to retirement. The rationale for IRDAI seeking a higher retirement age is that since most of the industry experts who join are close to retirement, by the time they familiarise themselves with the working of the regulatory authority it would be time to hang their boots.
 
 IRDAI has a provision for five full-time members. These include one each to regulate life and non-life industry, one member to look after finance and investment and one member for actuary and a member in charge of distribution.
 
 The member-finance and investment will replace former   chairman S V Iyer, who was appointed for a two-year tenure in May 2015 immediately after her retirement from the bank. The post of member distribution has been lying vacant for a long time since D D Singh retired in July 2015. He was the first to be appointed for the position, created in 2013.
 
 The retirement age for the IRDAI chief is 65, which is the same as the   governor. However, deputy governors retire at 62. In the late 90s, when the retirement age for public sector employees was increased to 60 from 58, the retirement age of deputy governors was raised to 62 and brought on par with judges of the  . Unlike the post of the RBI governor, where two of them are internal appointments, IRDAI members are all recruited from industry.
