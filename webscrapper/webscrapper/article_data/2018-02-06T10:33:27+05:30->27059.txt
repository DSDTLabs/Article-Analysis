 Ravi, a resident of Sangabasavanadoddi, Ramanagara, was woken up by a barking dog. He went out and saw a leopard entering his unoccupied house next door.

Forest department officials rushed to the spot and tranquillized the big cat, which appeared to be threeand-half-years old. The officials suspected the leopard may have entered the village from   forest.
 
 "It came looking for the dog and entered the house around 3am. We rescued the leopard three hours later. The dog which was attacked by the leopard sustained injuries and has bite marks on its body,” said an official.
