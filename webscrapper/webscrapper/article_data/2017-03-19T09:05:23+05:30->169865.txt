HYDERABAD: A   in the City Civil Court complex has passed an interim injunction restraining an NRI husband in the US from pursuing a divorce plea in a  .

 The Family Court judge passed the interim order after hearing aggrieved wife Soni Oleti Kommineni of Erramanzil colony . She was aggrieved with the divorce petition filed by her husband,  , in a district court in Texas without any information to her. She came to know of it when court notices were issued to her. The proceedings launched in her absence offend the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, her counsel Balaji Vadera told the family court.
 
 Soni's marriage with Prasad was performed by their elders at Tirupati on February 20, 2014. A dowry of `10 lakh cash, 100 tolas of gold and 10 kilos of silver ornaments were given to Prasad by Soni's parents, the wife's counsel said. From the next day itself, the husband's family began harassing her for additional dowry of `1 crore, Balaji said.
 
 To take Soni with him to US, Prasad took `3 lakh and flight tickets from his in-laws, the counsel said. There were indiscriminate incidents of torture and attacks on Soni by her husband at Texas also, he said.
 
 After their son Advaith was born on April 8, 2015, Prasad sent Soni and their son to India.According to the petitioner, Prasad's mother accompanied them and upon arrival in India, she took their passport and documents, rendering them ineligible to return to US.
 
 Later, Prasad moved the Texas court seeking divorce.Soni is not in a position to go to Texas to respond to court notices. Hence, she approached the   and sought an injunction that prevents her husband from pursuing the case against her in a foreign court. Since the marriage was performed here under the Hindu Marriage Act, Prasad is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Indian Courts, Balaji said.
 
 The Hyderabad Family Court, while issuing an interim injunction, posted the case to March 31for further hearing.
