NEW DELHI: The government barred   on Friday from accepting deposits under the   (PMGKDS), a move aimed at curbing any misuse. 

 The measure comes after various government agencies unearthed irregularities in several cooperative banks across the country. Investigations by the income tax department revealed that a large number of cooperative banks were manipulating and laundering unaccounted-for money after the government scrapped the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes on November 8. 
 
 The government amended its earlier notification to make it clear that cooperative banks were not allowed to accept deposits under PMGKDS. The government had notified PMGKDS in December. Deposits under this scheme can be made by any person who declares undisclosed income under Pradhan Mantri   (PMGKY). 
 
 The amount, which shall not be less than 25% of the declared undisclosed income, can be deposited in authorised banks from December 17 to March 31. “In this connection, it is clarified that cooperative banks are not authorised banks to accept deposits under PMGKDS, 2016,” a finance ministry statement said. 
 
 The government had rolled out the ‘Taxation and Investment Regime’ for PMGKY in late November. Those who declare under this regime shall be required to pay tax at the rate of 30% of the undisclosed income, and penalty of 10% of the undisclosed income. 
 
 A surcharge to be called ‘Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan cess’ at the rate of 33% of tax will also be levied. In addition to tax, surcharge and penalty (totalling approximately 50%), a declarant will have to deposit 25% of undisclosed income in the PMGKDS. The amount is likely to be used for schemes across irrigation, housing, etc.
