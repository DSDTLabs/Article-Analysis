When   set out to make  , he decided to look at it as a member of the audience and work on elements that he would want to take back with him after watching it. “When I go to watch a movie, I want it to stay with me — be it the music, lines that I may want to say repeatedly or scenes that I may reminisce and laugh about or get teary-eyed for. A film has to have that kind of effect on you and that is what I have attempted with Srinivasa Kalyana. This is a film that has all the right elements to haunt you. The varying graph of emotions in the story will make people laugh or drive them to tears,” says the actor-director.
A delay in the release of the film has it pitted against a big project and while Srinivas admits that he is all nerves, he is confident in his product — a light-hearted romantic comedy with no fights. “The talking point of this film will be its story, which explores the concept of moksha and the deadly sins, through the life and relationships of the hero. The songs, especially Bettadmele Srinivasu and Gappu Gappalli, are noteworthy. But, most importantly, audiences will be amazed by Ashwin Kadambur’s  . Given our budget constraints, he worked with a basic camera, and barring the introduction song, shot everything else in natural light. If that wasn’t challenging enough, he also had to conceptualize scenes without camera cranes, tracks, trolleys or even drones. He has done his best in this situation and his work is to look out for,” he says.
