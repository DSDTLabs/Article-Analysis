INDORE: Four persons including a woman and two minors were   when they were   by a door-to-door garbage collection van of IMC in Hawa Bangla area of the city on Sunday morning. 

 The police said that the incident took place at 8.30am and the driver was speeding the vehicle. 
 
 The driver identified as Dinesh (30) Premchand Verma first hit a couple near Maa Kalka Dwar in Sudama Nagar area. Then, in a bid to flee the scene, he accelerated. But it led to further trouble since the vehicle collided with a bike near Mata Gujri Gate area, said the police. 
 
 “The driver hit two vehicles before he was stopped by locals of the area,” said police. 
 
 A police patrolling team was called up and the driver was handed over to them. A case under section 289 and 337 of IPC and section 184 of MV Act has been registered against the driver at Annapurna police station. 
 
 The injured have been identified as Alka Sheikh (52), her husband Kamal Sheilh (61), Abhishek Jaiswal (14) and Vinay (13). They were taken to a nearby hospital. 
 
 Hospital sources said that Alka and Abhishek sustained serious injuries in their rib and leg respectively, while Kamal and Vinay sustained minor injuries. 
 
 IMC officials said that they made arrangements for treatment of the victims. “We are investigating the matter and action would be taken up if any of the staff is found guilty,” said an IMC spokesman. 
 
 This is not the first time when an IMC’s garbage collection van has hit people on streets. Earlier, in September last year, a man was hit by a garbage collection van as the helper drove the vehicle. A 16-year-old girl was also killed after being run over by an IMC garbage collection van. 
 
 Citizens have also complained about reckless driving by IMC garbage collection van drivers, but civic body seems to have ignored taking any measures to keep a check on its vehicles engaged in door-to-door garbage collection work.
