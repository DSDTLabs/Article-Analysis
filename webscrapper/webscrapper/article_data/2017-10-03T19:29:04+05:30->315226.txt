 The Haryana Police have been conducting searches at various locations, including the India-Nepal border, to trace

 On September 26, the Delhi High Court had dismissed the transit anticipatory bail plea of 
  Insan. The court's order was based on the grounds that she had been evading arrest and hence was not entitled to any discretionary relief.
