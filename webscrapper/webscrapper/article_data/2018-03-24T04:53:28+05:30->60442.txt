MUMBAI: Several   with children applying for seats under the   ( ) Act quota are having to run from pillar to post as the income certificates issued in their names are not being accepted by several schools. 

 Under the RTE Act, 25% of seats at unaided non-minority schools are reserved for needy students. These students have to submit income certificates as proof at the time of admission. 
 
 However, at some schools, students have been turned away for submitting their mother's income certificate instead of the father's. Rules are in place to accept a mother's income certificate instead of the father's in case of divorce or death. 
 
 "My husband left the family about four years ago and never returned. We can't get any documents for the admission, but the school refuses to accept my documents," said a mother from Andheri who now runs the house.
 
 Officials said that a decision will be taken on a case-to- case basis. "We have got complaints and referred them to the education officer. We will ask schools to take an undertaking or an affidavit from the mothers and admit students," said an official.
