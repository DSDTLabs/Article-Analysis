NEW DELHI: The students of Class XII, who sat for their physics   on Wednesday, were a happy and relieved lot while leaving the examination hall. They said the paper was easy.

 Even teachers appreciated the paper for being balanced and fair. They added that while it was easy for average students, it also carried a challenge for above-average students. However, a missing value in a five-mark question left the students baffled, forcing them to leave the answer incomplete.
 
 Sarthak Jindal, a student, said he found the paper easy, but lengthy. “Though I didn’t leave any questions, it took a lot of time to finish Section C. The three-mark questions were concept-based and it took me time to crack them,” he said. Another student, Akshat, however, left the entire section. “The paper was lengthy. I knew all the questions in Section C, but could not attempt even one because of lack of time,” he said.
 
 A Class XII physics teacher at Ahlcon International,  , said the questions were structured in such a way that most students would have been able to score partly, but only a few would be able to get full marks.
 
 “Questions, like the five-mark ones, start out easy, but get tricky towards the end. Students can easily score three marks, but those last two marks are difficult. Those who tried to crack the question aiming for a full score found the paper lengthy,” he explained.
 
 Rawat also pointed out a mistake in the paper. “One option in question number 24 in Set 1 required students to find the maximum value of the current, but the resistance was not given. Though the question is simple, it only needs application of a formula. But the students had to leave the answer incomplete because of the missing ‘R’,” he said.
