A popular circus troupe is in town, just in time for the summer holidays. The performers included those from African countries, who put up daredevil stunts such as lipin board acrobatics, reverse gun firing, rope acts, statue acrobatics, tower  , flying trapeze acts, horse riding stunts, fire act and African yoga, among others. Dogs, camels, horses and parrots were also part of the acts, raising questions on ethics.
