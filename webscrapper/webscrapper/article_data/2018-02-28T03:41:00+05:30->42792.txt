185 words TNN Panaji: Members of College Contract And Lecture-Basis Teachersâ€™ Association of Goa (CCALTAG) recently met the director of higher education, Prasad Lolyenkar, and submitted a memorandum seeking revision of salaries in view of the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations.  The teachers were accompanied by office-bearers of the University College Teachers Association of Goa (UCTAG). A UCTAG member informed the director that salaries of contract and lecture-basis college teachers have not been increased following Pay Commission recommendations and urged him to look into the matter. Lolyenkar said the department had already moved a file to the government in this regard. The memorandum said teachers on contract/lecture basis, who form about 25% of the total number of college teachers in the state, put in an equal amount of labour for all kinds of college activities, including research work, as full-time teachers. However, they get only 75% of the remuneration received by regular teachers.  It said higher education in the state has made tremendous progress with higher enrolment ratio and better NAAC rankings and teachers on contract and lecture-basis have played an equal role towards this accomplishment. The memorandum noted that Article 14 of the Constitution talks about equal pay for equal work.
