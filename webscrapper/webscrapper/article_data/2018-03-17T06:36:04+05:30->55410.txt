HYDERABAD: A light drizzle on Friday morning was enough to turn city roads into a slippery maze, much to the shock of two-wheeler riders. Several bikers and scooterists lost balance while riding through the slippery portion of the roads, but luckily there were no casualties. Though police swung into action by sprinkling sand on the slippery stretches to prevent skidding, alarmed motorists took to social media warning about the perils of skidding.

 In fact, cops had to close down Telugu Thalli flyover for 30 minutes, while incidents of bikers losing their balance and vehicle skidding were reported at Tank Bund, between   X Roads and   near Ashok Nagar, Nagole, Tarnaka, Sitaphalmandi, Lalapet bridge area, Prasad’s Imax and Abids.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 It all began at around 10 am when   traffic police received an alert about some two-wheelers skidding on the Telugu Thalli flyover. “Road on both sides of the flyover turned slippery for some distance and a couple of scooterists lost balance and fell down. We temporarily closed the flyover for about half an hour and sprinkled sand and mud on the slippery portions to prevent accidents,” traffic inspector V   told TOI.
 
 Police, however, were quick to allay the fears on social media and said that there were no incidents involving skidding of autorickshaws or four-wheelers. The cops with the help of GHMC workers got into action immediately and sprinkled sand on the affected stretches. “We also alerted motorists through Twitter and averted further damage,” a police official said.
 
 Cops heaved a sigh of relief as no casualties were reported though the skidding-related incidents happened on the busy streets in the morning.
