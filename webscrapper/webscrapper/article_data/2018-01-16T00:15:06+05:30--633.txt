Pune: Professional Teachers Association (PTA), which includes about one lakh  , are up in arms against some clauses in the Coaching Classes bill drafted by the state education ministry to regularize private classes. 

 From limiting the students to 80, fees, salaries to the teachers to giving 5% of their income to the government, the association of coaching class owners, in a press conference on Monday said they are opposed to various clauses in the draft.
 
 The fourth meeting between PTA representatives and government officials was on Monday. The owners said both sides agreed on registration fee, inspection, waiting rooms, parking issue and educational cess.
 
 “The registration was earlier proposed for a year with the fee at Rs 10,000 per course. We told them that the registration fee should be as per the local body and for three years,” Sandeep Devadhar, a member of the PTA who was among the six people from PTA who attended the meeting.
 
 “It is not possible to regulate fees. For example, rent is high in Pune and Mumbai compared to other cities. Even within Pune, it differs from Kothrud and Warje-Malwadi. The quality of staff is different. Depending upon which competitive examination the student is appearing for, subject charges differ. So a set fee structure is not possible. The government has asked us to draft guidelines on fee structure within eight days,” Devadhar added.
 
 The government has stipulated 80 students per class and extended to 120 after inspection. But coaching classes want the limit as 120 and with inspection to be 150. A final draft will be drawn up and will be open for objections and suggestions.
