CHENNAI:   president M Karunanidhi is unlikely to participate in his   function in Chennai on June 3, said party working president M K Stalin on Monday.

 The party is organising a function at YMCA ground in Royapettah here on June 3 to celebrate Karunanidhiâ€™s 94th birthday and completion of his 60th year as a legislator. The function will start at 5pm.
 
 Speaking to reporters at the party headquarters, Stalin said, "As of now there is no chance of Thalaivar (Karunanidhi) participating in the function. But if the doctors treating him allow him to participate, he will."
 
  "Almost all opposition party leaders have confirmed their participation in the June 3 function.   vice-president  , former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and former chief minister Lalu Prasad, CPI Rajya Sabha member D Raja, Nationalist Congress Party chief and MP Sharad Pawar, TMC whip Derek O'Brien, IUML chief K M Kader Mohideen and Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy will participate in the function," said Stalin.
 
 Asked whether the opposition party leaders would discuss presidential election at the function, Stalin said, "The June 3 meeting is not meant for that. Discussions are going on among leaders on the presidential election. Recently, Congress president   spoke to me and told me about a candidate for the election. Similarly, other leaders are in touch with one another on this issue."
