Mumbai:   corporator and former BMC opposition leader Devendra Amberkar, who quit the party and joined the   on Sunday, has alleged that the ‘dadagiri’ of city unit chief Sanjay Nirupam forced him to make the switch. 

 Amberkar, who was known to be close to former Union minister Gurudas Kamat, has been associated with Congress since the last two decades and was also the opposition leader in the BMC before he was replaced by Pravin Chheda, who switched over from the  . 
 
 The differences between Kamat and Nirupam have only increased in the last few days despite the civic polls less than a month away. “Nirupam’s dadagiri tactics in the party were not ending. I felt that he was trying to trample upon the Marathi ‘manoos’ in every way. Therefore getting fed up, I decided to move on. It feels bad to leave the Congress considering I have contested civic elections on their ticket since 1998,” Amberkar said. 
 
 However, TOI has learned that Amberkar was refused a ticket from the ward in Andheri where he has won in the past. “I was being asked to contest from another ward in Goregaon where I have no connections,” added Amberkar. Nirupam rubbished Amberkar’s allegations. “I am not a part of the candidate-selection procedure and it is being handled at the district level by former MPs, MLAs and district presidents. Therefore it seems like someone is deliberately telling those who leave the party to name me,” said Nirupam. He also tweeted: “Party has a declared policy to renominate all sitting corporators. Who denied ticket to Amberkar while process is still on at district level?”
 
 The Sena has reportedly promised Amberkar a ticket from the ward in Seven Bungalows from where he is keen on contesting. 
 
 The Congress is battling with factionalism and dissent. Several senior leaders have switched sides. Former MLA Krishna Hegde left the Congress last week, blaming Nirupam for his “autocratic” style of functioning.
