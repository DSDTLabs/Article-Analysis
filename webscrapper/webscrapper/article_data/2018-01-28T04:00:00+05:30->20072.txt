Ahmedabad: Farmers at Visalpur village in Daskroi taluka protested on Saturday as the water supply from Fatehwadi canal, one of the main sources of water for Ahmedabad’s districts, has been stopped since January 17. Farmers warned the state government to start Narmada water supply immediately or they would intensify their stir and that may include even self-immolation before the state assembly.

 One of the protesting farmers from Visalpur village, Vikramsinh Chauhan, said that they were not even informed that supply from Fathwadi canal which provides irrigation water to four talukas — Daskroi, Dholka, Bavla and Sanand — would be stopped. 
 
 “The government has stopped the water supply in Fatehwadi canal. Our paddy and wheat crops along with maize crop (for cattle fodder) are dying due to lack of sufficient water. We had raised this issue before the local BJP MLA, Babu Jamnadas Patel, but did not get a satisfactory answer,” Chauhan told TOI.
 
 He further said that if the water supply is not restored in the next couple of days, their crops will be destroyed. “Thousands of farmers from the four talukas are under debt of moneylenders as they have borrowed money for their crops. If the crops are destroyed, many will have no option but to commit suicide,” Chauhan said.
 
 A statement by the Visalpur Piyat Sahkari Mandali says that if the government does not take immediate action, “farmers will have to march to the state assembly and attempt self-immolation for which the government will be held responsible.”
