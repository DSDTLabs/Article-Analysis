DEHRADUN: Defence personnel in  , comprising almost 30% of the over 75 lakh-strong electorate, is a sizeable, soughtafter bloc.

 It includes the veterans as well as families of serving and retired offi cers and jawans. Recognising the community’s infl uence especially in Dehradun, Lansdowne, Almora, Ranikhet, Rudraprayag, Karnprayag, Chamoli and Udham Singh Nagar, the two main national parties are trying to woo them.
 
 BJP’s Pankaj Dimri from Chamoli said: “We have many retired Army men in our party such as Gen V K Singh, Maj Gen B C Khanduri and others, who’ll campaign in areas dominated by ex-servicemen.
 
 “We’ve kept our promise of implementing OROP and started initiatives like the move to change the minimum height requirement for hill men from the state.” The party also expects the recent appointments of Gen Bipin Rawat as Army chief, DGMO Lt Gen A K Bhatt and other senior offi cers from the state will work in their favour.
 
 The   has promised a ministry to look after the issues of defence personnel. CM Harish Rawat mentioned this while releasing the ‘nine promises’, given a chance to form government again. Cabinet minister Dinesh Agarwal told TOI that if voted back, the Congress government would remove the excise duty on liquor, a long-pending demand of the defence.
 
 But veterans say it’s unlikely they’ll vote en masse. “More than the party, the candidate matters. Background of the candidate, commitment and track record will determine our choice,” said Havaldar (retd) Ram Kishore, a resident of Udham Singh Nagar. Brig (retd) Baljeet Singh told TOI that appointments of Army chief or other seniors “hardly make any difference because defence forces do not think on regional lines.”
