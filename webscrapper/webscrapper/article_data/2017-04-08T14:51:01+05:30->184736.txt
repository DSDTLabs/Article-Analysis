ALLAHABAD: In compliance with the   order, Allahabad district administration will impose a fine on farmers who burn agricultural residue in the open, in a bid to contain rising pollution levels in the district. 

 Joint agriculture director, RB Singh said, "Farmers here often burn crop residue once harvesting season ends, which adds to   pollution. Farmers owning less than two acres of land will be fined Rs 2,500 while those owning land over two acres but less than five acres will have to pay a penalty of Rs 5,000 if they are caught burning agricultural residue in open."
 
 Farmers owning plot bigger than five acres in size would have to pay a fine of Rs 15,000. 
 
 Singh said punitive action would be taken against regular defaulters who were found to be polluting the atmosphere. As per   norms, the state bodies has the power to withdraw any form of relief or assistance extended to such farmers.
 
 It may be recalled here that the NGT had asked five states including Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi to issue directions for banning the burning of agriculture crop, claimed authorities here.
