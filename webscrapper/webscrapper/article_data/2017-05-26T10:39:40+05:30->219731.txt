When   Women’s Champion ‘The Princess Empress of tomorrow’   walked out of the All State Arena, Chicago after NXT TakeOver Chicago, the 35-year-old wrestler broke one of the most incredible pro-wrestling record. Goldberg’s legendary winning streak of 173-0 during his days in WCW (World championship  ) seemed to be a record no one would come close, but Auska’s dominance since arriving in NXT, in late 2015, has been such that she has surpassed Goldberg’s winning streak and currently sits pretty at 174-0. 

 Her 174th win came at Chicago the previous weekend emerging victorious in a triple threat match for the NXT Women’s Champion involving Ruby Riot and Nikki Cross. Since making her debut inside the yellow ropes on Oct. 7, 2015, Asuka is yet to be beaten in singles competition, and she has never been pinned or made to submit. Her title reign stands at 419 days and counting.
 
 Asuka acknowledged her incredible feat on Twitter, and former Universal Champion   — whose legendary 173-0 streak propelled him to the main event of WCW in the late 1990s — offered his own congratulations:
