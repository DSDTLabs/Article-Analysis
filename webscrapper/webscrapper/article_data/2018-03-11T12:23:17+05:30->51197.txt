BHUBANESWAR: The   (OSPCB) has asked the administrations of Puri and   to seal illegal  . As many as 55 such illegal kilns were operating in both the districts without having obtained   (EC), the OSPCB said. 

 "We have written to the collectors of both the districts and asked them to seal brick kilns. Earlier, we had identified those violating the norms and submitted the list to the district officials," said OSPCB regional officer (Bhubaneswar)  .
 
 The green panel said the kiln operators had access to free sand as most of the kilns were located close to the river beds. This not only deprives the government of royalty, the unabated use of sand, the burning of brick by using wood and the digging of the earth by using heavy machinery harm the environment. The kilns also affect aquatic and avian species found in rivers. "Getting an EC is mandatory for operating a brick kiln as it falls under the minor minerals category. The kilns also cause water pollution," Panigrahi said.
 
 On the day the kilns will be sealed, officials from the pollution board will accompany the district officials. Normally, the chimneys of the kilns and the source of water and power are closed. On February 12, the pollution board had received complaints against 11 brick kilns flouting environment norms. After an inspection, it found that 55 kilns did not have the EC. The district administrations were asked to close these units even before the pollution panel served their owners with a show-cause notice. The pollution board norms also say the kilns should be located at least 200 metres away from the river beds and human habitation.
 
 In December 2015, the OSPCB had closed 28 kilns in the two districts.
