Mumbai: The national carrier, Air India (AI), on Monday strongly objected to a report published by Flightstats, a data services company, which globally ranked the airline as the third-worst carrier in flight schedule punctuality.

 Calling the report incorrect and misleading, AI alleged that the report appears to be the work of “vested interests who wanted to tarnish the carrier’s image”. On Monday, Flightstats published the report ranking carriers world wide on their on-time performance records. On-time performance (OTP) is a measure of punctuality with which an airline operates its flight schedule. Air India was ranked third after Icelandair and El Air in the worst performers list. 
 
 In a letter sent to flightstats, AI said that it ranks among the top 10 carriers in terms of OTP among the prestigious Star Alliance consortium of airlines. The Star Alliance consortium consists of 27 airlines including United Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa, Swiss etc. Since the past two years, AI has had a consistently good OTP of over 78% on its domestic and international routes, which is at part with its competitors, the letter said.
