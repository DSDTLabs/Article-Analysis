Immersing in patriotic fervour, members of a city-based ladies club celebrated   at a star hotel in the city recently. Drawing inspiration from the Republic Day parade in New Delhi, the ladies divided themselves into groups to represent seven states of India and showcased their cultures by staging folk dance performances and skits. The ladies also put up a skit on ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ based on the   blockbuster Sholay. The lavish spread too was a hit as the guests were treated to an array of delicacies from each state. From Punjab’s makki ki roti and sarson ka saag to Maharashtra’s dabeli and Rajasthan’s jalebi, the spread, like the event, celebrated the unity and diversity of India.
