KOLKATA: Over 23,000 foreign devotees of the Indian Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) movement gathered in Nadia’s Mayapur on Wednesday when two giant wheels, or ‘Sudarshan chakras’, were mounted on the dome of the Temple of Vedic Planetarium. The congregation included Alfred Ford, great grandson of Henry Ford.

 The globe atop the temple is said to be the largest in the world. The two chakras, one weighing 1,500kg and another weighing 500kg, were lifted by cranes to the top of the 113m-high structure and fitted to the central dome. Made of steel and plated with gold, the chakras have been named Radha Madhav and Narasimha Dev respectively. The diameter of the main chakra is 23 feet and its height is 18 feet. The smaller chakra is 10 feet in diameter and eight feet high. The chakras were made in Russia according to design specifications by a devotee who is an engineer.
 
 
  
 The temple, nearly the size of the Giza pyramid, is spread over 4 lakh sq ft and is capable of holding more than 10,000 people inside the main hall. Vedic interpretations of the universe will be represented inside in the form of a 3D mobile model suspended from the ceiling of the main dome. The altars will house idols of Radha, Krishna, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and the Gaudiya Vaishnav Acharyas.
 
 The main dome is bigger in diameter than the  ,  ,   in London and St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican.
 
 Alfred Ford, who has played a key role behind the temple’s construction, became a disciple of Srila Prabhupada, the founder of Iskcon in the 1970s. As head of the project, Ford, whose spiritual name is  , has been collecting donations from all over the world to build the temple. “In 1976, Srila Prabhupada, my spiritual father, told me that he dreamt of a Vedic temple of such dimensions. He asked me to work towards it. I am happy that I have been able to fulfil his dream,” Ford said. His wife, Sharmila, also a devotee, is from Naihati.
