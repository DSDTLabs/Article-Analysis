Ahmedabad: Diwali is unlikely to add a shine to the real estate market as realtors expect fewer new launches in the wake of compliance issues with the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), issues related to Goods and Service Tax (GST) and overall sluggishness in the realty market. Developers’ estimate that new launches will not be more than 15%- 20% of the number of projects launched last year.

 “I was planning to launch three projects in Diwali. However, the launch has been postponed till January next year. The decision was taken due to delays in securing approvals, without which a developer cannot register projects with the state-level RERA regulatory authority,” said a realtor, who asked not to be named.
 
 There many others who do not see many projects coming to the market this Diwali. “Even on Dussehra, the number of new launches was less than 10% of new schemes launched last year. There will not be many new launches in city during Diwali as well. It should not be more than 15%-20%,” said Ashish Patel, president, Gujarat Institute of Housing and Estate Developers (GIHED), the Ahmedabad chapter of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI). Around 100 new projects hit the Ahmedabad market last Diwali.
 
 “Apart from the compliance with RERA, there is still confusion among developers and consumers about input tax credit under GST. This coupled with sluggish market conditions has adversely impacted new project launches,” added another builder.
 
 According to developers, there are often delays in granting approvals such as environment clearance, plan passing and conversion of agricultural land into non-agricultural. “For any realtor, this process takes around 10 months. Only after getting all these approvals, can one register projects under RERA,” said a city-based developer.
