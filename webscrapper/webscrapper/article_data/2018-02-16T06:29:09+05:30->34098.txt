KOLKATA: The death of a 33-year-old diarrhoea patient has left residents of  's J block jittery. They are now treading cautiously when it comes to consumption of water. As a precautionary measure, they have shunned water being supplied by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) altogether. While most are using bottled water for drinking, some have started using it for cooking and even washing vegetables. 

 Take the example of Uttam Das, who resides next to the house where Biswajit Das was living since February 2. Biswajit died on Wednesday after he complained of diarrhoea and abdomen pain. Uttam's household expenditure has jumped as his nine-member family has started relying on bottled water for drinking as well as cooking. His sister-in-law Mona is already affected by the enteric outbreak.
 
 "We are drinking bottled water ever since my sister-in-law was affected by the outbreak. But after the death, we have started using bottled water for cooking as well. Who will take the risk?" fumed Uttam.
 
 A 20-litre bottled water of a local brand was being sold for Rs 40 till the outbreak surfaced. But now, the price has leaped to anything between Rs 60 and Rs 80. Residents have been left with no option but let themselves be fleeced as none wants to take a chance. 
 
 "With one death and hundreds affected in the locality, there is no point in thinking about money and putting our lives at risk. The price of potable water has shot up suddenly. I hope the civic body realizes our water woes and provide us with potable water till the outbreak ends," said Mira Das, a homemaker.
 
 Sonali Saha, Mira's neighbour, is lucky that she has a water purifier installed. Saha uses water from the purifier not only for drinking but also for washing vegetables and utensils. "I have become very cautious. I have kids at home. I have to keep them away from coliform. Things have become quite scary after the death on Wednesday," she said.
