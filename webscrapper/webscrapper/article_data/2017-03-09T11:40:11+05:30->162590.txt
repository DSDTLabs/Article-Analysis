KOLKATA: Ahead of a meeting with the state, officials and heads of leading   of Bengal discussed a set of proposals on Wednesday that included efforts to remove misconceptions about them. They also plan to call upon the government to identify the schools which, it believes, have been indulging in malpractices. The association in Bengal, however, supports the government’s approach.

 “Firstly, we want the government to pin-point the schools based on the available information. Secondly, we would like to have the proposed meeting at the earliest so that all misconceptions are cleared. We are confident that the government will understand the contribution of private institutions in the expansion of English-medium education in Bengal vis-à-vis the expenditure involved in providing such education,” said  , secretary, Association of   Schools in Bengal. 
 
 Das said government bodies treated them as commercial organizations. “Each private educational institution is run by a trust or a society. They are bound by some income tax norms, which can’t be violated,” De added.
 
 They also want the state to keep in mind that there will be no political interference in their functioning. “We want to win the trust and faith of the authorities at the helm of affairs. There will be always a few who may violate. Let them be brought to book. We would like to appeal to the government not to bracket all schools in the same category and penalize them,” De argued.
 
 A private school principal pointed out that the private institutions run by minority organizations remained out of bounds of the RTE Act 2009. “If the government introduces measures to govern private institutions, the rules should be uniform and applicable to all.”
