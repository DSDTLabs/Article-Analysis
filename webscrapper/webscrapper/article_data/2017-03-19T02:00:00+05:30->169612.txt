PATNA: Buoyed by the success of smart classes for its MCA, Science and MBA students, the J D Women’s College is planning to extend the facility to all departments.

 According to college principal Shashi Singh, smart classes use interactive modules like videos and presentations to teach students. Converting one classroom into a smart class costs around Rs 2.5 lakh. “We have 20-25 classes. We sent a Rs 6-crore proposal in this regard to the state government which sanctioned half of the expenses. The rest will be borne by the college,” she said.
 
 College students are excited. “I have seen MBA classes which are really good. Students can store the lessons in their pen-drive,” said Divya Malhotra, a second-year BBA student.
 
 BCom first year student Kajal Shrivastava added she would be delighted if the smart classes became functional from this academic year.
