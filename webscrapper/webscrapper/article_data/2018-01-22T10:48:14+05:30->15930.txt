LUCKNOW:   will be the partner country for the Investors' Summit being organised by the UP government in Lucknow in February.

 Officials said that the acknowledgement was received on Sunday. "A delegation of Japanese businessmen recently visited the state and met chief minister   as well. We are expecting more visitors from Japan during the summit on February 21 and 22," said a senior government official.
 
 Meanwhile, in a bid to clear pending proposals before the summit, infrastructure and industrial development commissioner Anup Chandra   has written to the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation ( ), asking for camps to be set up to resolve any issues. In his letter, Pandey has said that the government "desires that disposal of cases in industrial areas be done in a hassle free and time-bound manner". 
 
 He said: "For this, several processes have been simplified but it is possible that several cases are still pending at UPSIDC's zonal offices and headquarters. To resolve this, UPSIDC should set up camps at district levels where officials from both the district and headquarters be present. The process to clear plans etc., online should be functional and cases pertaining to trade charges should be disposed of on the spot."
