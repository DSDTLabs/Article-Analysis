Kolkata: With the Bengal   Summit scheduled on January 16 and 17, the state is all set to replace the existing street lamps between the airport and   with   bulbs. The 26km stretch passing through New Town and Bypass via the Maa flyover will be lit up with LED lamps on high-mast towers. 

 Urban development minister   on Wednesday said a decision was taken to replace all bulbs with LED ones along the 26km stretch between Nabanna and the airport to make the city look more attractive to prospective investors. “All illegal hoardings, banners and posters from this stretch will be removed. Only the hoardings on display by the I&CA department and government agencies will be allowed to remain,” he said at a meeting with officials of KMC, NKDA, KMDA and various other municipalities.
 
 Hakim said a special task force will keep tabs on cleanliness and officials of different agencies have been asked to see that garbage does not spill on to the roads. Strict action will be taken against anyone found guilty of dereli-ction of duty. 
 
 Officials said the cost of lighting up the entire zone between airport to the state secretariat will cost around Rs 10 crore — cheaper the the existing lights and cost-saving in the long run. On an average, about Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh is needed to replace the lamps in each kilometre. Most of the street lamps will be replaced by LED bulbs of 22-25 watts. The high-mast lights will have LED bulbs of 150 watts each. 
 
 The official said that the cost of lighting 40 LED lamps of 25 watts for an hour will be around Rs 6 while the cost of lighting up the area with sodium vapour lamps was about six times more. Nabanna had been decked up with LED lamps during Diwali and the sodium-vapour lamps around the secretariat will be replaced by LEDs.
 
 The state has also prioritized beautification of the city for the BGBS 2018 with plants being placed along this 26km stretch.
