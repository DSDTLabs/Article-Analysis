NAGPUR: If you were thinking of enjoying a swim in Ambazari   this summer, then better find another facility. The   ( ) has closed down its Ambazari swimming pool for over six months for its complete renovation. 

 Pankaj Patil, NIT’s division officer (west), said that the filteration plant, all tiles of the pools, water pipelines, etc. would be changed which would take some months.
 
 “We have decided to replace the existing chlorination filter plant with an ozonisation plant. The old plant will have to be removed and the civil work for ozonisation plant will be done. Then, the new filteration plant will be installed. It is the civil work that will take some months,” he added. The cost of the renovation project is about Rs 9 crore.
 
 The NIT’s decision to close the pool for such a long duration defies all logic as it had already done so for six months between October 2015 and March 2016. During this period, the NIT only did renovation of shower baths and carried out some minor repairs.
 
 The users of NIT’s Ambazari swimming pool were not satisfied with the work as they felt that it was of substandard quality. They also wondered as to why the filteration plant had not been changed.
 
 Manmohan Bajpai, president of Ambazari Pool Users’ Association, said that while the swimmers had no objection to closure of the pool for renovation, NIT should complete the work within three months. “We are not going to allow them to close down the pool for eight months. The NIT should not take citizens for granted,” he added.
 
 Vishal Patil, another swimmer, also demanded that the renovation work should be completed as fast as possible. “A period of eight months is too much. Moreover, they should have closed the pool during winter months when the number of users is low,” he added.
