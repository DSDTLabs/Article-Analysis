 As hundreds of tourists are reaching here every day, the villagers in the low-lying areas worry that increased tourism can result in consequences similar to those as faced by the Rohtang Pass. To counter the negative effect of increased human activity in the snow-clad area, the local villagers have formed   Paryavaran Suraksh   to keep a watch on tourist activities and environment conservation.

 Nearly 25 people from Prini village, including its panchayat representatives, went to Hamta on Sunday and met with all the persons operating business here. They requested them not to litter the area and only use eco-friendly products. They also warned them against cheating, overcharging and misbehaviour.
 
 Samiti president Kundan Lal, who is also the former panchayat pradhan of Prini, said it was good that Hamta had gained popularity among tourists in a short time but it is responsibility of the local residents to ensure protection of the environment.
 
 “We talked to tourists. We met with all the small traders here and requested them to be responsible. We shall keep checking if people are littering the area, water sources or harming the plants here. We shall also keep educating everyone to be friendly with the tourists,” he said.
 
 Prini panchayat pradhan   said everybody had promised to cooperate with them in maintaining the beauty and sanctity of the place. “The government has now approved to allow 300 tourist vehicles to go to Hamta every day. People of Manali have witnessed how an uncontrolled tourism to Rohtang Pass resulted in the   intervention. We shall not let this happen to Hamta,” he said.
