Actor   has broken both his arms in a stunt that went wrong while filming for an upcoming project. 

 Ahead of a Karlovy Vary film festival screening of Taylor Sheridan's 'Wind River', Renner said he fractured his right elbow and left wrist in an on-set accident.
 
  
  
 "It's part of the job. There will be an effect to it, but it won't stop me from doing things that I need to be doing ... I'll heal fast. I'm doing everything I can to heal faster," Renner said. 
 
 "I am doing a comedy ('Tag') that has a few stunts in it. It won't really affect my job. It affects how I get dressed in the morning I cannot tie my shoes," he added. 
 
 Renner said visual effects in his movies like  's ' ', leave him surprised. 
 
 "Visual effects has become a huge part of filmmaking nowadays, and it is also done so well. I remember watching the first ' .'... It was so big and there were so many characters and so many things going on, you can't really understand from the script what the hell you are really doing... 
 
 "And then the effects take over. Once we're done with principal photography, it goes into editing and the effects are added...So it is always a surprise when it comes to films like 'Avengers' and the whole Marvel universe to see (the finished movie)," he said.
