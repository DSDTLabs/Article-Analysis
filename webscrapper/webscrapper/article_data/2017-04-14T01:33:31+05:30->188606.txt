GHAZIABAD: Residents of   in   were left gasping for fresh air on Thursday morning even as garbage was burned in a dumping ground near   underpass. Residents said it took two hours for the maintenance staff from nearby societies to douse the flames. Locals in Indirapuram claimed that the dumping of domestic waste in the vacant ground and burning of garbage has been a perennial issue for about a year.

 “When we woke up today, the entire society was enveloped in smoke. We had to send the maintenance staff from the nearby societies to put out the blaze,” Jigyasu Pun, a resident, said.
 
 Residents said that vegetable and garbage vendors from Sector 62 in Noida dumped waste on the plot and set it ablaze early in the morning, before 5am every day, to avoid getting caught. 
 
 “We filed complaints with the GDA in November and then in December last year. In December, we were successful in keeping this area free of garbage. Another complaint was filed by us in January and GDA sent its staff to clear the area. However, things are back to square one,” said Himanshu Malik, a resident of Amrapali, a residential society.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Chakresh Jain, executive engineer, GDA, said, “This area does not come under the purview of GDA. It comes under the NH-24 widening initiative and so it is NHAI's concern. Keeping a check on waste burning is pollution control board’s responsibility.”
