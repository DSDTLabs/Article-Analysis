NEW DELHI: Two passengers and a ground staffer were arrested on Sunday at the   airport for allegedly trying to smuggle out goods after entering with fake tickets,   officials said. 

 The passengers were intercepted by CISF officers after they were found carrying 10 bags and exiting without any of them. They were scheduled to board an   flight to Srinagar, an officer said. The passenders told the officials that they were trying to smuggle out goods to Srinagar with the help of a ground handling staffer of AI. "Further inquiry revealed that the tickets they were carrying were forged so that they could enter the airport to smuggle out goods without paying any transport charges. All the three accused were handed over to the police," said a senior CISF officer. 
 
 Sanjay Bhatia, DCP (IGI) said, "They would send clothes to Srinagar and get dry-fruits in return through the same method. We will now interrogate the AI SATS member to find her role in this act". tnn
