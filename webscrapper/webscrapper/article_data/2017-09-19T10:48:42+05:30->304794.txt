THANE: A   here has been sentenced to three years'   for filming his sex session with a married woman and selling the clip to her husband, resulting in divorce.

 District judge S C Khalipe held Sunil Gupta, 38, guilty under section 67A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, for publishing or transmitting of material containing sexually explicit act etc. in electronic form.
 
 Advocate Vandana Jadhav , who argued for the 28-year-old woman, said she had shifted to Pune after her marriage in 2007. In 2011, she came to stay with her parents in Thane after an altercation with her in-laws and husband.
 
 “Here she got acquainted with Gupta and started working in his office. On October 31, 2011, after exchanging Diwali greetings, Gupta took her to show his new office. He later took her to a lodge near Thane station and the two got physically intimate.He kept his mobile phone above the bed to ensure that the entire act was filmed. When the women asked him why he was so particular about the mobile, he clarified that he was arranging it to get strong signal,“ the prosecution told the court.
 
 When she returned to Pune, Gupta followed and contacted her husband. He told him about his affair with his wife and sold him the video for Rs 1lakh. It fueled the acrimony between the woman and her husband, and concluded in divorce. Gupta's aide reportedly transferred the video and received the cash from her husband.
 
 Khalipe ruled that the reputation of the woman has lowered and her career and life ruined by the act and convicted Gupta under 67A of the IT Act and section 292 of the Indian Penal Code.
