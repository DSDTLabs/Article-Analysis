Singer   says she wants her three-year-old daughter   to feel inspired by her work, when she grows up. The 38-year-old songstress says unlike other mothers she does not feel guilty leaving her little one at home as her partner, former backing dancer Azuka Ononye holds the fort for her.

  
  
 "I'm going to work to do something I love and she (Azura) will realise that as she gets older and it will hopefully inspire her..."
 
 "I hear a lot of women talking about feeling guilty about working but I put a different spin on it. I do miss Azura, but I don't feel guilty because if she is at home with Azuka or my mum she's happy," Dixon said.
 
 The ' ' singer adds being a mother is the best feeling in the world. "Family life is so important. Being a mum has changed me. It is the most joyful thing I have ever experienced. It's also the most challenging!" she said.
