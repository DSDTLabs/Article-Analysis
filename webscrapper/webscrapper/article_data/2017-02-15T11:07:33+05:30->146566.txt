LUDHIANA: A day after 26 tank shells and four   were found at an under-construction   on Ludhiana Malerkotla road, about 12 kilometres from here, the ammunition continues to remain at the spot. 

 A resident had spotted the shells and the grenades near an inner road, about 50 metres from Alamgir village gate, and called up the cops at 100 on Monday morning.
 
 The police control room alerted Dehlon police, who covered the area with about 30 sand bags and cordoned it off. 
 
 Later, the Ludhiana Police wrote to the deputy commissioner, requesting him to ask the Army unit at Dholewal Chowk for a bomb disposal squad to collect the ammo from the spot.
 
 Ludhiana deputy commissioner Ravi Bhagat said, “A bomb disposal squad has been sought from the Army authorities. They will have to take permission from the ministry of defence, as the Army in Punjab does not have it. I will again ask the Army authorities to expedite the process.”
 
 Police, however, continues to be deployed at the spot.
 
 “We have deployed an assistant sub-inspector and four constables at the site. Dehlon SHO, too, was there on Monday night. Our team will remain there till bomb disposal squad arrives. We have alerted the area residents not to venture near the spot as it could be risky,” said deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Bhupinder Singh Sidhu.
 
 The ammunition has caused panic in the village. 
 
 “We could not sleep on Monday night after we learned about the shells and hand grenades lying at the under-construction colony. The large quantity of ammunition has spread fear among the area residents. It should be removed at the earliest,” said a resident.
