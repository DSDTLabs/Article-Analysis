  “The matter is being investigated; we have sought the hotel records, as well as the CCTV footages of the hotel. The statement of the survivor will also be recorded. The application by Namdeo is also being looked into. He complained of high blood pressure and his condition deteriorated in the night. So, he was shifted to Hamidia hospital.
