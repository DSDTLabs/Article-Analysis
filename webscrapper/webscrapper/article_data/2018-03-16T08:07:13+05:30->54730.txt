 On Wednesday evening, the complainant, who is an intern with a local Hindi daily, was allegedly sexually harassed by Juber and Arif, when she was on her way to meet her friends who were waiting near a shopping mall at Press Complex. She protested and a verbal duel broke out between the accused and the friends of the complainant.

Even as the two sides fought, a 100 dial vehicle passed from the spot and took Arif into police custody while Juber escaped.
 
 Police arrested Juber on Thursday morning, and the two accused were brought to the site of the incident on foot for a spot verification. They were later produced in court, where Arif was granted bail on the basis of the girl's statement. Cops also forced the closure of all roadside kiosks in the busy area after the incident.
