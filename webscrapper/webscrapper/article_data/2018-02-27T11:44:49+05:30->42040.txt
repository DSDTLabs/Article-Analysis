PATNA: After nearly 3% fall in 2015-16, Bihar’s economy recovered the ground the following year and recorded 10.3% growth rate in 2016-17 to be back among the fastest growing states in the country.

 According to the Economic Survey Report (ESR) for 2017-18 that was tabled in the state assembly on Monday, “During the last decade (2005-06 to 2014-15), the state income at constant prices grew annually at average 10.1%. The growth rate of the state gross state domestic product (GSDP) was 7.5% in 2015-16 and 10.3% in 2016-17.”
 
 While it might be unwarranted to compare the state’s GSDP growth rate with the national GDP due to the latter’s sheer size, Bihar’s ESR 2017-18, nonetheless, noted that its growth rates have been higher than that of national economy. However, the per capita income of the state in 2015-16 was 31.6% of the national average, but it increased to 32.4% in 2016-17.
 
 After tabling the report on the opening day of the budget session, deputy CM Sushil Kumar  , who also holds the finance portfolio, told media persons, “The   government came to power in   in 2005-06 and laid the foundation of the state’s economy. It is this foundation that helped the state’s economy in recovering the lost ground.”
 
 Interestingly, the report has mentioned the impact that the state’s economy suffered due to the “sluggishness of the national economy” for six financial years from 2010-11 to 2015-16, in general. Then, demonetisation announced in November 2016 also hit the motors of the economy, like real estate and services sector.
 
 “Post-demonetisation, there was a jolt in the capital market as its sudden promulgation ended the supply of commercial capital causing a fall investable surpluses,” the report stated, adding there was “deceleration of the growth process”.
 
 Curiously, Abdul Bari Siddiqui of the   was the state’s finance minister during 2016-17 under the Mahagathbandhan government, which was later replaced by the NDA-II government led again by CM   in July 2017.
 
 Referring to Siddiqui’s performance, Modi said, “No one can do charisma or miracle in one year. The foundation of the state’s economy was laid in about a decade since 2005-06 under the NDA-I government (led by Nitish). This foundation bred resilience and the recovery of the lost ground.”
 
 The Asian Development Research Institute ( ) prepared the state’s ESR 2017-18, twelfth since 2005-06. Its member secretary Shaibal Gupta, who was present with Modi, said, “In the last 12 years, the government’s economy has been given structure and governance, which cannot be reversed.”
 
 The report said the ‘drivers of growth’ of the state’s economy since 2011-16 have been mining and quarrying (67.5%), manufacturing (25.9%), transport, storage and communication (13.5%), all of which registered a growth rate of more than 10%.
 
 The state’s finance has also remained revenue surplus — that is, the state has been left with surplus to invest on the creation of assets after spending on committed expenditure (salaries, allowances, pension, etc) from its revenue earnings. The surplus has increased from Rs5,101 crore in 2012-13 to Rs10,819 crore in 2016-17, and is projected to be Rs14,556 crore during 2017-18.
