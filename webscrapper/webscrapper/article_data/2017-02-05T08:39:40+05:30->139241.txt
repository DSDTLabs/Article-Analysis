HYDERABAD: In a relief for thousands of aspirants from the city, the   (CBSE) clarified that the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) 2017 would be counted as the first attempt for all candidates. Students had been on tenterhooks when the   on January 27 had issued a circular limiting the number of NEET attempts per candidate to three from this year.

 Candidates from the city, attempting the test, will be hoping to secure a seat in seven government and 20 private colleges.
 
 The CBSE's clarification has brought cheer given the large number of students who appear for the test every year. In 2016, nearly 30,000 candidates from Telangana had written NEET. This time, the number is expected to touch 50,000 as engineering, agriculture and medical common entrance test score will no longer be considered for a medical seat. As per the   ruling in July last year, NEET is be the only way to gain admission to undergraduate medical and dental courses from this academic year.
 
 “After the CBSE put a cap (on the number of attempts), there was ambiguity . Many of my friends and I too had already appeared for the examination twice. But now we can attempt the exam three more times,“ said  , 21.
 
 While many welcomed the new ruling, some still expressed concern over only three attempts being permitted.“There are many students who enrol in coaching programmes and appear for the test every year in the hope of cracking it,“ said Dr G Srinivas, president of Telangana Junior Doctors' Association. Now, he said many aspirants would be forced to settle for BDS or BSc seats. The association is planning to send a representation to CBSE and the state government demanding cap on attempts be scrapped.
 
 Candidates who did not fill the application form after the three-attempt rule for AIPMT NEET, can now the fill same, read a notification.
