NEW DELHI:   passed a   on Monday to accord constitutional status to   ( ). 

 The proposed legislation was passed amid opposition’s apprehensions that a certain clause in the bill would bypass states in deciding inclusion or exclusion of particular castes in the   list.
 
 Lok Sabha approved the Bill with 360 members voting in favour and two against.
 
 Some opposition members including BJD’s   and RSP’s NK Premchandran moved amendments which were defeated.
 
 Replying to opposition members’ concerns, social justice and empowerment minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot said the Bill, which has similar provisions as the SC and ST commissions, will not curtail the powers of states in any way.
 
 Gehlot said, “We will not take way the powers and rights of states. I assure you that. The power of state commissions will continue. We do not want to weaken states now or in future. We respect the rights of states. 
 
 We will not distract from the federal structure. The Centre will act on the recommendations of the governor which will be submitted after consulting the respective state government.
 
 We are trying to strengthen the commission and not weaken that.”
 
 Stating that there was a difference between consulting states and getting consent of states, Congress member   wanted clarification from the minister on the issue.
 
 Earlier, sources said that Congress chief   had asked party members why they were supporting the Bill if there were so many problems, but the Congress decided to go ahead because of the sensitive nature of the legislation.
