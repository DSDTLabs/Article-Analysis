NAGPUR: A two-day interactive   ‘Splash’ was organized by   (SAF) with the aim to train individuals to help children manage their emotions and develop their overall personality. It was held at  , on Saturday.

 The initiative was taken by neurologist   and psychiatrist Sushil Gawande who also run the foundation. Citing the ‘stunted emotional development’ in the youth of today, they said that such a workshop is required in current times. Day one of the workshop was conducted by Karandikar which focused on controlling the basic cognitive functions of one’s own mind like analysing a particular situation and take decisions based on the knowledge at hand.
 
 According to Karandikar, emotional and mental development is a very important subject which needs to be included in the school syllabi so that kids become aware about the critical aspects of human psychology from a young age. 
 
 Around 20 people above the age of 17 years, including teachers, students and social workers attended the first session of the workshop where Karandikar stressed upon the significance of  . 
 
 Stress management was the main topic for day two. “Unfortunately, kids are not taught how to manage stress. It should be done right from the beginning and the absence of such training is a major disadvantage when they grow up and are, at most times, unable to manage their emotions in a social setting. Those who have naturally learnt to manage their stress will be able to cope just fine, otherwise it becomes difficult for many,” Gawande said.
 
 According to Gawande, external factors are only 25% of the problem when it comes to people who suffer from stress. Most of the problem is subject to internal factors. “It all comes down to how one perceives a certain situation and how he or she reacts to it. The more one can tackle a problem logically, the less stressful it becomes,” he said.
