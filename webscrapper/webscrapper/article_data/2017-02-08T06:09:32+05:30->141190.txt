AHMEDABAD: The state government has finally given its approval for   (volume-based)   (GDCR), with which volumetric development will now be available for developers on the riverfront. The   ( ) is likely to auction two building footprints, one each on either bank in April-May.

 “We are waiting for the real estate market to jump back to stability before we announce the dates. We had postponed the decision in December because of demonetization. This year we expect the real estate markets to improve by April and May,” said a senior  . Four buildings of the 42 proposed on the riverfront will be 101 metres tall.
 
 In simple words, the ‘footprint’ will be the land area on which the proposed building can be built while the ‘volume envelope’ will define the height up to which it can be constructed. The rider is that none of the footprints will be sold to developers.
