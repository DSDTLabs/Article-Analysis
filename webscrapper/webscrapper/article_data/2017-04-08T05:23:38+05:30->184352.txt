KOCHI: The high court has set aside an order issued by the   rejecting the claim of members of a royal family for a  , in tune with those paid to member of other   in the region. The court also said it is time for bringing in uniformity in the matter. 

 A   considered a petition filed by   of Thekkedathu Kovilakam and 54 other members of royal families questioning denial of enhancement of their pensions, which presently stands at Rs 1,000, whereas enhancement has been grated for Njavakkattu Meenachil royal family from Rs 600 to Rs 3,000 per month.
 
 The petitioners were originally granted a monthly pension of Rs 9.81, which was subsequently enhanced to Rs 300, then to Rs 600, and now stands enhanced to Rs 1,000.
 
 During an earlier round of litigation, government had argued that higher pensions are being paid to those royal families that had surrendered a larger extent of land. Government had also cited financial burden, stating that the petitioners' royal family had more members than others. Pointing out that the government has not adopted a uniform stand, the court had directed for a reconsideration of the issue. However, the government considered and rejected the claim.
 
 Opposing the challenge to the rejection of pension enhancement, government now argued that the pension to Thekkedathu Kovilakam was recently enhanced from Rs 600 to Rs 1,000. A uniform rate cannot be adopted now in view of the financial constraints, the court was told.
 
 In the judgment rejecting the government's contentions, the single bench pointed out that there is no material to justify the argument that differential treatment is being given to different royal families on the basis of the extent of land surrendered by each family. Setting aside the order rejecting enhancement of pension, the court asked the government to begin the process for bringing in a uniform rate of pension.
