THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   team, which visited the Pampady Nehru College of Engineering in   is likely to submit an interim report to education minister C Raveendranath on Monday. 

 According to sources, the   team, led by university registrar G P Padmakumar, has received several complaints that substantiate most of the allegations raised against the college management. "The status report is being prepared and is expected to be handed over to the government most probably on Monday," sources said. The college chairman is learned to have told the university team that he has failed to convince the students and parents that he acted with the best intention.
 
 Meanwhile, the Yuva Morcha has sent a petition to the   (AICTE) seeking action against the self-financing engineering colleges that subject students to harassments on college campuses. The  's youth organisation asked the AICTE authorities to set up a special team to probe into the suicide of B.Tech student Jishnu Pranoy in Pampady Nehru College and alleged harassment of girl students at the Toms College of Engineering in Mattakkara. 
 
 "There are more than hundred self-financing engineering colleges established under various religious trusts, minority bodies and a few business groups. The sole aim of majority of these colleges are to make money and not to improve academics. The students using college hostel facilities are treated in inhuman ways and the understaffed   has not been able to make effective interventions. The state government has not been keen in analysing the issues," the petition said.
