GANDHINAGAR: After the historic clean sweep in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and winning substantial seats in Goa and Manipur,   is very keen to ride the great saffron wave by holding early elections in the PM and national BJP president Amit Shah’s home state. 

 The state BJP’s top brass are publicly denying the possibility of early elections. But there is a strong buzz in party rank and file that they should go for early elections in the state to benefit from the saffron wave and also to minimise the risk of any negative developments, said sources.
 
 
 
 
 Bad monsoon predictions have already been made. No political party, especially in Gujarat, would like risk facing farmers facing a drought in the election year.
 
 
 
 
 BJP should give no time to   (PAAS) leader Hardik Patel, OBC leader Alpesh Thakor and dalit leader Jignesh Mevani who are all out to damage the BJP’s prospects in the assembly elections.
 
 
 
 Congress has failed to utilise the past eight months while the PM has made eight visits to the state in the same period. His visits have rejuvenated the BJP’s prospects while the Congress has not been able to match his pace. Delhi CM   will hold his first public meeting on March 26 in Gandhinagar. By holding early elections, the BJP will prevent these parties from winning over the masses.
