NEW DELHI: Two days after a man was killed and his girlfriend seriously injured by the woman’s family in  , police have arrested her younger brother Shakti. 

 The woman, Meenakshi, had shared her location with Shakti which he in turn shared with her family members and other relatives, police said.
 
 Police said that Shakti had booked two cabs —one for the victims and the other for the killers from his mobile phone. They are also looking for a relative of the deceased,  , who had plotted with the killers to track him down. Police are probing if Shakti had lured the couple promising to get them married and are also checking his call details. 
 
 The accused Rinku and Shankar told police that they had been looking for the couple since last Monday. On Friday afternoon, they got a call from Shakti saying that the couple was in Seemapuri. 
 
 Rinku asked Shakti to book a cab for them too and help track down the couple. They followed them for nearly 10km and found the opportune moment when Dinesh stopped the cab to relieve himself. 
 
 Both Rinku and Shankar claimed that they had taken the step to save the family’s honour. Meenakshi was to get married in February and had fled with some cash her father had collected for the ceremony, they added. Meenakshi has been sent to Nari Niketan and provided police protection.
