Ahmedabad: With the unpredictable economic scenario in the country, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) often struggle to survive, but innovation can provide the key to their sustainable long-term growth, experts said on Saturday at the MSME Conclave, organized at Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA) on Saturday. “Demonetization had a severe impact on MSMEs as these industries ended up struggling for funds and managing operations. However, it is important to understand that growth can come not only from stable finances, but also from innovation. MSMEs therefore must strive to innovate as that will be a differentiator for them,” said Jaimin Vasa, senior vice president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industries (GCCI). Echoing a similar view, Ketan Patel, chairman and managing director, Troikaa Pharmaceuticals Ltd, said, “MSMEs are now being recognized by the government as a significant job creating sector. It is important that these firms improve quality and at the same time focus on optimizing the process through incremental innovations from time to time, to be able to compete in the global market.”
