Nagpur: The grounds of Chitnis Park, Mahal, reverberated with sounds of cymbals on Friday as noted kirtankar from Pune, Mansi Badwe, kept the audience engaged with the rousing tale of Rani Padmini. Badwe was performing at the Rashtra-Dharm Kirtan Mahotsav organized by Radha Govind Charitable trust. This is the second year of the programme.

 “It doesn’t matter how long a human lives, but how principled he is when he lives,” said Badwe. She began the evening with abhangs, since a kirtan cannot be complete without invoking Tukaram, she said. She urged the audience to inculcate values passed on by saints through abhangs. “Only when there is place in one's heart, will one see God in a stone idol. Reading only makes the meaning clear, but implementing cleanses one’s soul,” she said.
 
 The story of Queen Padmini or Padmavati’s valour, as she refused to be captured by Allaudin Khilji, was brought alive by Badwe. Shridhar Korade accompanied on the tabla, Dhanraj Yawalkar supported with organ, sitar was played by Nasir Khan and Shirish Bhalerao was on violin.
 
 Badwe is a recipient of Pune Mahanagarpalika’s 2005 Bal Gandharva Puraskar and referred to as ‘Kirtan Chandrika’. She has sung kirtans in and outside Maharashtra and performed on All India Radio and Doordarshan.
 
 The mahotsav, which began on January 5, will conclude on January 9, with kirtans every day at 6.30pm at Chitnis Park, Mahal. On Saturday, Sandeep Mandke, young kirtankar from Pune, will narrate the story of Afzal Khan’s killing titled ‘Pratapgadhcha Rannsangraam’. On Sunday, Rajendra Bua Mandewal from Mumbai will perform on Sant Tukaram Maharaj. The festival will conclude with a performance by Charudatt Afle of Pune, who will speak on Shreemant Bajirao Peshwe.
