 During his interrogation, Tala said he used to supply the spurious milk to Ramesh Faldu, who runs a dairy in Jesapar village of Kalavad taluka. Following this information, the cops raided Faldu’s dairy in Jesapar village and arrested him. 
 
 “A total of 500 litre spurious milk and a mini tanker were seized from Faldu’s dairy. Also arrested in the raid was   (27), a resident of Kalavad, who was the tanker driver,”   said.
