BENGALURU:  , Basaveshwaranagar, west Bengaluru, has filed a complaint with the cyber crime police on Wednesday, seeking legal action against miscreants who were spreading false information that tarnished the reputation of the school. The complaint pertains to a video of an incident that occurred during school day celebrations on the campus last year.

 The video doing the rounds claims that nine students died and six were injured when the metal roof of the temporary stage on which they were performing a skit collapsed. The school clarified that the metal frame with electric lights had collapsed during annual day celebrations on February 13, 2016 and a few students had sustained minor injuries. A police enquiry was conducted during that time and the report was dually submitted to the education department. Some parents had made videos of the incident.
 
 “Now, the same video is being circulated through social media saying nine students have died while six others sustained serious injuries,” the complaint stated. “Worried parents and guardians are arriving at the school, enquiring about the incident.”
 
 Police said an investigation is on. “No doubt it is the same video,” police said. “But miscreants have manipulated the video to say that nine students have died and six others have been injured. It looks like the miscreants who uploaded the video did it with an intention to damage the school reputation and create panic among teachers and parents.”
