Kolkata: The members of a local club, supposed to be a wedding venue on Tuesday evening, allegedly locked out the groom’s family a few hours before the event.

 Subhas Sangha sports ground off Chetla had rented out a portion of the field to set up a tent for the wedding. The members, however, didn’t open the venue saying the ground had to be maintained for an upcoming volleyball tournament to begin from Saturday.
 
 “We found the gates locked and the club members refused to open it. Instead, they asked us to enter the venue from a back gate which was narrow and unfit to welcome guests,” said a relative of the groom.
 
 The family then approached police, who forced opened the gates for the wedding. “We went to the spot with the groom’s family and checked the documents which the club provided at the time of booking, assuring them they could enter the venue,” said an officer of Tollygunge police station. tnn
