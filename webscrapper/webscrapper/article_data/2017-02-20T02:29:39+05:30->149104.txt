CHENNAI: Residents of a   in   suspect that the killer of a three-year-old girl in their locality may be closer home than they are comfortable with.

 They — and the child’s parents — suspect the offender who is believed to have abducted, sexually assaulted and killed the child on Saturday before dumping her body in a garbage yard was a neighbour.
 
 Municipal workers discovered the body of the little girl in a dump yard in Thiruvottiyur on Sunday afternoon, said N Paruthi, a witness and a resident of the locality, said.
 
 “The body was severely battered with injuries on the face and torso,” she said. “Her mouth was also stuffed with rags. The workers alerted police, who informed the parents.”
 
 Paruthi, who with neighbours and the child’s parents spent Saturday evening and night hunting for the girl, said, “Her mother had fever so she took some tablets and went to sleep. The girl was playing with her brother in an open area when the culprit took her away.”
 
 The crime was particularly chilling to residents of the locality because it happened in their midst, when there was no apparent cause for alarm.
 
 “We are shocked that she was murdered at such close quarters,” said Meenakshiammal, another neighbour. “The offender apparently bought the children ice cream, before taking away the girl.”
 
 “The child’s father used to go fishing on a trawler here while her mother was a homemaker,” she said. “The girl’s mother planned to admit the girl to the same school where her brother is a UKG student. The brother has been very quiet since yesterday.”
