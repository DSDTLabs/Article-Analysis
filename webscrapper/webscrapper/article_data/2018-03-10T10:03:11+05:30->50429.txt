MOHALI: The municipal corporation (MC) has proposed Rs 15 crore deficit   for 2018-19 fiscal year. The annual budget worth Rs 112 crore has been proposed, which will be up for approval during the special budget   meet slated for March 12. 

 In the proposed budget, the accounts department has shown an estimated expenditure of Rs 128.17 crore against the total income of Rs 112.93 crore, thus showing a net deficit of Rs 15.24 crore.

 MC Commissioner   said, “We will be focusing on balancing the fiscal deficit by increasing the collection from various factors such as building application fee, license fee, and tehbazari. We will be working on these factors so that it can give us a boost of around Rs 10 crore nearly to balance the fiscal deficit.” However, the target of income generated from the advertisements remained unchanged. Unlike last year, the estimated income generation via advertisement tax is proposed at Rs 10 crore. 
 
 The primary source of income of the MC for the financial year 2018-19 would be property tax, which is estimated at Rs 19 crore. There is a slight hike here of Rs 2 crore from the previous year’s budget.
 
 Similarly, additional excise duty is expected to yield Rs 10 crore, rent fee income is worth Rs 30 lakh and water supply and sewerage income generation to yield Rs 1.30 crore. 
 
 Expenditure is set at Rs 138.50 crore. Out of this, Rs 40.5 crore will be spent on the establishment expenses. Expenditure on committed expenses would be Rs 35.2 crore whereas and Rs 4.50 crore would be spent on contingency.
