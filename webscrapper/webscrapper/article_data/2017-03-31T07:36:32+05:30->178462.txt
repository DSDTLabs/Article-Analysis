INDORE: The body of a two-month old baby girl, who allegedly died after some complications, was sent for post mortem examination on Wednesday night after her father claimed she had been murdered.

 The incident came to the fore on Wednesday after   police received a call from a Bhopal-based man who claimed that his estranged wife had killed his newborn daughter.
 
 The complainant Manoj, who works in BHEL,   got married one and a half years ago to Indore-based woman Varsha. However, after a few months, after facing harassment at the hands of her in-laws, Varsha started living with her parents in Indore. She had also filed for a divorce.
 
 Varsha gave birth to a baby girl   two months ago. Even after repeatedly calling Manoj to come and meet his child, he did not pay heed to the calls and did not turn up.
 
 On March 23, Trisha fell ill and she was rushed to the hospital by her mother and grandparents.
 
 Before doctors could treat her, the child had already died. The body of the newborn was handed over to family members who started making preparations for her funeral.
 
 Even after trying to contact Manoj over phone to inform him about the demise of his daughter, Varsha’s father Chandulal couldn’t get through. At last, he called Piplani police station in Bhopal and narrated the entire incident to them.
 
 He asked them to contact Manoj and tell him about his daughter’s death. After Manoj found out, he claimed that his daughter Trisha had been murdered. He complained about this to dial 100 following which the matter was sent to MG Road police station.
 
 Police reached the house and the baby’s body was taken for post mortem examination.
 
 “We are awaiting the autopsy report following which we will be able to say something about the case,” said  , MG road police station in-charge.
