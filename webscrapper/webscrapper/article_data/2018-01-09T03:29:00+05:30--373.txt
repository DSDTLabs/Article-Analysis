Panaji: The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) will start issuing permissions to applicants of private beach shacks starting this week. About 300-odd private beach shack applications are pending with the coastal management body. This tourist season, there has been an extraordinary delay in issuing permissions and shack operators had been bitter about it.  “We will start issuing licences for private shacks from this week,” Parag Nagarcenkar, GCZMA member secretary, told TOI on Monday. Following an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) two years ago, it has become mandatory for private beach shacks to obtain GCZMA permission.  Travel and Tourism Association (TTAG) president Savio Messias said that applications had been submitted to GCZMA in June, months before the tourist season kick-started.  Officials of the coastal body said due to shortage of manpower, site inspections could not be completed on time, which led to the delay.  President of All Goa Private Shack Owners’ Association, Dharmesh Saglani, said private shack operators were frustrated with the delays every season. As the delay means loss of business, private operators have been demanding a separate shack policy which would specifically take their requirements into account. Also, they have been demanding a single-window clearance system for timely issuance of licences. Nagarcekar also said that all shacks that have been set up without permissions will be removed.
