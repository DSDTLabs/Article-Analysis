CHENNAI: Around 100 women, mostly residents of  , took out a march on Sunday to express their discontent towards political events that led to the formation of a government under   earlier this month.

 Demanding the resignation of MLAs who supported Palaniswami, the demonstrators sought “restoration of democracy“ in Tamil Nadu and called for the political class to “respect people's sentiments“. M “For the last several days, the talk has been about the incidents that happened at   resort.We could not take our minds off it,“ said   S, one of the demonstrators.
 
 The absence of a platform to voice their anger forced the women to take to the streets. Armed with banners, they took out a silent march. A signature campaign was organised and more than 150 signatures were collected for a petition to be sent to the President and Tamil Nadu governor. “We cannot ask them to dissolve the government which may not be possible. But we can ask them to respect our sentiments because we did not vote for this chief minister,“ Pramila said.
 
 Asked if the present government did not deserve time to prove itself, one of the demonstrators said, “The MLAs did not consider the opinion of their voters. We want our MLAs to think about us when forming a government and not about themselves. That's the basis of democracy.“
