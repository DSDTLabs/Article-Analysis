PANAJI: Supreme Court justice   on Saturday opined the need for a national policy to have a language that is understood through the length and breadth of the country.

 Bobde was discussing the complexities involved in translating from regional languages to English, at the release of a book on translation of common civil code from Portuguese to English by senior advocate Manohar Sinai Usgaocar. Bobde spoke about how Dr B R Ambedkar had foresight to make Sanskrit as the official language of the country. Taking a cue from Ambedkar's resolution, he said, “We should either have people who are able to do the translation, or we must switch to a language which we can access easily.”
 
 Bobde said that it was just the other day he understood Ambedkar’s remarkable foresight whilst he was the chairman of the drafting committee of the Constitution. At that point he proposed that Sanskrit should be the official language of  , and it was supported by few pandits and mullas.
 
 “The other brilliant insight, I think, Ambedkar had, was that in the north (of India) people have an aversion towards southern languages, Tamil, etc. and in Tamil Nadu there is an aversion to Hindi,” he said.
 
 Bobde believes that nobody will oppose Sanskrit as a language. He also said, “I don’t know how civic life and political life of this country is moving. I think we must have Usgaonkar’s ability with languages, or we have to switch to a language which we can access easily.”
