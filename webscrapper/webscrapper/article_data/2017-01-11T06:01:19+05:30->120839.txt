AHMEDABAD: President of the broiler farmers’ co-ordination committee, Anvesh Patel, in a press release stated that even as some 10km around Hathijan village of Ahmedabad, and the Union   have been declared ‘bird flu affected’, poultry products are safe to consume. Patel, in the press release, stated that even in the tests conducted by the animal husbandry department, chicken samples were found to be unaffected by the bird flu virus.

 "Bird flu was found in the guineafowl at   in Hathijan and in some ducks at Daman. Chicken and chicken eggs are totally unaffected by the virus,” Patel said.
 
 Patel also urged the government to ensure that chicken traders or people related to the poultry business are not harrased unduly by municipal or police authorities so that thousand of poultry famers can be saved from huge financial losses.
