PANAJI: Villagers of Neura have sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention to ensure that their fields are not destroyed due to saline water . 

 Local farmers have argued aqua-culturists were deliberately releasing saline water into fields and coconut plantations making them infertile, even as the state administration turned a blind eye.
 
 “The fish mafia is hand in glove with government officials. They have taken salt water to fields and started fish farming making fields infertile and non-cultivable. Flowing saline water in agricultural fields causes environmental hazards,” the villagers stated in their written representation before Modi, governor  , chief secretary, mamlatdar and Agasaim police station.
 
 “We the villagers request you to inspect the site along with Tiswadi taluka mamlatdar and talathi of village panchayat Azossim-Mandur and take necessary steps to rejuvenate the fields to their original condition,” the letter stated.
 
 Villagers said that during a sluice gate auction in December 2016, the circle inspector and talathi had agreed that saline water would not be allowed to enter the surrounding paddy fields but subsequently, authorities went back on their promise.
 
 Besides crops being destroyed and fields being inundated, villagers also face health problems, the letter stated.
