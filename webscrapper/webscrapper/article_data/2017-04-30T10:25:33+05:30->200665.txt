AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court fined a man Rs 10,000, for making false allegations that his daughter was illegally detained by a family in the city.

 A bench of Justice   and Justice   felt suspicious about the genuineness of the   petition, when the petitioner attached a marriage certificate of his daughter. The petitioner claimed that he had received the marriage certificate by post, but suspected the signature in the document was his daughterâ€™s. He feared illegal detention of his daughter by the person claiming to be her husband.
 
 On April 19, the high court issued notice with a caution to the petitioner, that if the allegation of abduction and illegal detention were proved wrong, the court would fine him. The girl, who is a final-year student at a college in Sola, came to the court on April 26 and told the judges that she had voluntarily left her home, joined her boyfriend and married him. She also told the court that after the wedding, she sent the marriage certificate to her family to inform them of the development.
 
 Before the HC, the girl confirmed that the marriage certificate bore her signature and conveyed that her parents were very much in the knowledge of the development. The father had disapproved of the relationship because she and the boy are from different castes.
