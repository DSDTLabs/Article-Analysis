AHMEDABAD: Two youths clad in blazers were seen mingling with delegates at   country seminar hall on Thursday. Questions revealed that the youths were among the youngest   at VGS-2017.

 “We have signed an MoU of Rs 13 crore investment in Ahmedabad to set up Gujarat’s first multi-layer PCB production line for electronics. In the next one year, we intend to create 125 jobs,” said Pratik Parmar, 24, founder and CEO of Crear Electronics.
 
 The team, which had won first runners-up prize in the state government’s ‘Pitch to Glory’ event in the run-up to the VGS, has created a palm-sized device running on   that can work as CPU once it is attached to any screen and input device like keyboard or mouse. 
 
 Vaibhav Patel, 23, CFO of the company, said their team members are from GTU and were inspired to take computers to villages at affordable price starting Rs 4,500 for the CPU. “It runs on open platform and thus there is no need to purchase an upgrade. Moreover, we have tied up with Taiwan to get required parts instead of China. We are getting incentives under government’s mSips and ESDM policy for startups and MSMEs,” he said.
