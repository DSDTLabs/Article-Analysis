BENGALURU: The   (ECI) on Friday evening deferred polling in   assembly constituency to May 28, with counting scheduled on May 31.

 
 The EC has cited the seizure of nearly 10,000 EPICs (electoral photo identity cards) with handbills featuring sitting Congress MLA N Muniratna on May 8 from a flat in Jalahalli in the constituency and a series of other election-related violations in the segment in its order.
 
 According to the order, investigations revealed that “the party concerned or candidate had used a firm to carry out a detailed survey of voters which included photo of the house, voters along with details of caste, gender, contact number and their passport-size photographs”.
 
 “This looks like a bid to make a large number of voters captive. It is either to make them vote for a particular candidate or coerce them not to vote at all,” Sanjiv Kumar, chief electoral officer, Karnataka, said on Friday.
 
 A city magistrate court, meanwhile, ordered Jalahalli police to invoke charges of cheating against the accused in the case, after hearing a BJP worker’s private complaint that police were soft in their approach to the accused, including Muniratna
