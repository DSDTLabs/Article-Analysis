NEW DELHI: The government on Monday averted an impending stay by the   on commercial cultivation of   mustard by assuring that it would first inform the court about such a decision before it is implemented on the ground.

 Appearing for petitioner Aruna Rodrigues, advocate   caught the attention of a bench of Chief Justice   and Justice D Y Chanrachud by arguing that if the Centre intended to accept the recommendation for permission to cultivate GM mustard commercially, it must be tested constitutionally and legally as the untold ill-effects of such seeds on domestic varieties of mustard would be irreversible.
 
 The bench was of the view that till the government took a decision and intimated the court about it, there should not be any permission to commercially cultivate GM mustard. “This is a serious issue. We do not know what effects it would have on the domestic variety of mustard. It would be better if the government does not implement its decision, if it permits commercial cultivation, till the next date of hearing,” the bench said.
 
 But additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta said this was an issue of huge implications and an interim order should not be passed at this juncture when the Centre has not taken any final decision. “I will come back with instruction from the authorities concerned in the government by Monday and till then there will be no change in the status quo,” he said.
 
 The bench said there was an apprehension on the part of the petitioner that immediately after taking the decision to permit commercial use of GM mustard, the government may permit implementation of the decision, thus presenting a fait accompli to the court. “All these years of efforts in the court for examining the legality of the decision on GM mustard will be lost. So why not take precaution,” the bench said.
 
 The   posted the matter for hearing on July 24.
