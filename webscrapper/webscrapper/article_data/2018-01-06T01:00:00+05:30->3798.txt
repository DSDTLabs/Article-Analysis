Ever since the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ' ' (now ' ') was deferred from December 1, 2017, speculations have been rife about the film possibly coming to cinemas on January 26. However, the   weekend has already been blocked in advance for R Balki’s ' ' starring   and Neeraj Pandey’s ' ' starring Sidharth Malhotra and Manoj Bajpayee. 
Though Viacom18 Motion Pictures, the studio behind Bhansali’s film, hasn’t officially announced its new date, we reached out to the teams of 'Padman' and 'Aiyaary' to check if they would consider moving their films, in case Padmavat also plans to release on the same day.
 While no one from Sony Pictures Entertainment was willing to speak on record for 'Padman', a source said, “On January 4, Akshay announced on social media that this film is releasing on January 25. So there is no question of changing the date.” Director   recently said that they always wanted to release 'Aiyaary' on January 26 because it’s about army men. So, it’s unlikely that they would shift the film release to another date. However, Jayantilal Gada, one of the producers of 'Aiyaary', told BT, “Let there be an official announcement from 'Padmavat' makers, then we will see. We are three partners on 'Aiyaary' — Reliance Entertainment, Neeraj’s production house and my company. If 'Padmavat' announcement happens over the weekend, we will meet on Monday and discuss our course of action.”
