 Viren says he has some very fond memories of Delhi from his playing days. "There are so many memories that it is hard to pick one. Hockey is my one true love and the emotions associated with it are overwhelming for me. So, the memories are all quite special. I remember so many India camps here, playing India-Pakistan series with the fans so charged up – they were truly memorable. It is emotional coming back here." Recounting his first memory of coming to Delhi as a hockey player, Viren tells us, "The first time I came here was in 1997 or '98 when I played the junior nationals for Mumbai. I remember coming to the National Stadium, seeing India Gate, the   in the same line and I remember being in awe of this place. To see the   was massive for me. Till today, every time I go back to the stadium, I get goosebumps."
 
  
  
 
 Of late, many of the games in big tournaments are being shifted from the National Stadium to   for logistical reasons, but Viren says he still remains in favour of using the National Stadium. "I think the National Stadium in its modern façade is a tremendous arena. In the old days, when I was playing, the seating was very far away from the ground, but now it has a fantastic atmosphere. It’s great to play there. Nothing can beat the experience of playing hockey at the National Stadium.”
