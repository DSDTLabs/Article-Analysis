Former cricketing ace   says that we need to change our attitude towards politicians and politics, and the way to bring about a change in society is to exercise your franchise, to ensure that the right person is elected.

 "I first voted right after I turned 18; it was very interesting to understand what voting meant. I remember that my family and I were the first ones at the   station and we cast our   as soon as the booth opened. It was an empowering experience as a citizen of India to know that I was ready to bring about a change in society, at least by participation. This is why we all need to participate in the   —there should not be any excuse to not do so. Many times, politics is shown in very poor light, but that’s not the case. Politicians’ intentions are great and they try to do a good job, so we should support them. The negative stereotype that exists about politics needs to change. If we choose the right kind of people, we will have the best person in place to govern us. If we don’t, then you allow anyone and everyone to come to power. We need to think about and see what’s good for the country, and then come out of the shadows and vote for the right people and the right party. Only when you do that can things change for the better. In a big city like Bengaluru, people are very busy and tend to not be in town on polling day. But it’s important that everyone cast their vote. Many people here are from different cities; if they’ve been living in Bengaluru for a long time, they should get their names included in the voting list of their current constituency of residence. Voting is not a tedious process anymore. Polling stations are user-friendly, so you don’t have to stand in long queues anymore. Any sensible citizen who cares for the country must go and vote."
