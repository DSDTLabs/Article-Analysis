GUWAHATI: With the   set to complete a year in office on Wednesday,   hope the discontinued North East Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy ( ) can be revived or a similar   be framed. 

 "Continuation of the policy would have substantially made up for the loss the state as well as the region suffered during the period of suspension," said RS Joshi, head of the Federation of Industry and Commerce of North Eastern Region (Finer), one of the largest industry bodies in the northeast. The NEIIPP 2007 expired on March 31 this year. Although it had been suspended in December 2014, registration of new units under the policy was resumed last year following court orders. 
 
 According to Joshi, investments worth Rs 10,000 crore would have come into the state and Rs 30,000 crore into the region by now had the policy not been discontinued. Industrialists said that though investment flow into the state did continue when the policy was resumed, the loss of industrial growth the state suffered in the nearly two-year-long suspension period could have been made up for had the policy been continued beyond March 31.
 
 During the third governing council meeting of the   last month, Sonowal raised the issue of continuation of NEIIPP till a new policy is put in place. The CM has been pitching for the continuation of NEIIPP since the BJP government was formed in the state last year. Industrialists, however, said the Centre has so far not evinced any interest, but the state government should persist with its demand.
 
 "The state government's demand should be amplified in such a way that Centre either continues with NEIIPP or puts in place another effective policy for industrial growth in the region," an industrialist said.
