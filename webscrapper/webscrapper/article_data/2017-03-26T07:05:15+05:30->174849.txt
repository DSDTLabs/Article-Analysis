AHMEDABAD: Having established a strong position in dairy business, Amul is now venturing into frozen snacks with the launch of frozen parathas, patties and samosas over the next two weeks. The dairy giant is also coming out with 3-4 types of sweets, which include milk cake, dodha barfi and pinni.

 “We are venturing into the frozen snacks segment. Around 7-8 types of such frozen snacks will be launched in the next two weeks, including paneer and cheese parathas, patties and samosas. We are also looking at what other such snacks could be offered in future,” said R S Sodhi, MD, Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which markets milk and milk products under Amul brand. 
 
 “A robust cold chain is required for frozen products. Amul is the only player, which has well-established cold chain network with 66 depots and 2 lakh outlets from   to Kanyakumari and from Jaisalmer to Shillong. Frozen food products are already being consumed in India. Hence, we thought of venturing into it,” Sodhi explained.
 
 As far as its core business of dairy is concerned, Amul plans to invest Rs 2,000 crore over the next two years for expansion including setting up of new plants. “We are in the process of setting up dairy plants in Kolkata and Vashi (Mumbai). Another plant with around 2 lakh litres per day capacity is planned at Varanasi ( ),” Sodhi added.
 
 GCMMF is putting up an ice-cream facility in Nagpur, while Pune will have Amul’s dairy plant with ice-cream unit. Its new plants in Kanpur and Lucknow have also begun to operate. Back home in Gujarat, Amul is investing around Rs 600 crore for expanding the milk processing of its AmulFed Dairy at Bhat in Gandhinagar from 35 lakh litres per day (LPD) to 50 lakh LPD. It is also expanding ghee and butter manufacturing capacity at Bhat.
