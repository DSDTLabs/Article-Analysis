BHOPAL: A Class 8 student from  , who went missing on Monday and was rescued in Ludhiana, was on Friday reunited with his family but he hasn’t said why he ran away from school and took 1,000km train journey.

 The boy says he doesn’t remember anything from the last three days, and has told his parents and school principal that there was nothing wrong at school.
 
 “I have taken his statement on record. He said that he was not punished or scolded by teachers. He also said it was not because of the school that he ran away,” said the school Principal Neha Adharyu. “The reason he gives for running away is rather worrying. He told us that some kind of external energy forced him to take the step, which had nothing to with school or his family,” she added.
 
 The 16-year-old had gone missing after school on Monday and was traced in Ludhiana the next day. The boy was detained by GRP Ludhiana, who were surprised to find him in school uniform.
 
 His parents had alleged the boy went missing after being punished by teachers for being late to school. However, on his return, the parents are also keeping mum over the issue.
 
 Speaking to TOI, his brother said that the boy will not attend school for some time. “Hedoes not recall anything. He seems disturbed and wants to take a break from school. Let him relax a while,” his brother told TOI. The teen has also denied that he was disturbed because of certain ‘family issues.’ 
 
 He had left school at 1.40pm and reached Habibganj station, where he boarded a Ludhiana-bound train. City SP Bhupindra Singh refused to comment on the issue.
