BENGALURU:   released an edited video on Monday to hit back at Karnataka   chief B S Yeddyurappa’s allegations that chief minister   sent Rs 1,000 crore, from kickbacks received on various projects (including the controversial steel flyover in Bengaluru), to the Congress brass.

 In the video, Union minister   is heard telling   to keep the bribery charges alive until the assembly elections, due next year. 
 
 Recorded at a BJP function, the video has Kumar and Yeddyurappa, oblivious to a microphone placed in front of them, joking about the political fallout of the bribery charges against the CM.
 
 Yeddyurappa claimed to have based his allegations on a diary reportedly seized a few months ago by income tax officials during a raid against Siddaramaiah’s parliamentary secretary and MLC K Govindraj. 
 
 Congress officials, including five ministers from the Siddaramaiah cabinet, released the video clip, reportedly obtained from a Kannada channel, at a hurriedly convened press conference here.
 
 The ministers said the conversation made it “very clear” that the bribery allegations against Siddaramaiah were politically motivated.
 
 Congress MLC V S Ugrappa alleged that BJP ministers too were paying their high-command. He said a   judge should inquire into Kumar’s and Yeddyurappa’s purported confessions in the clip, of having paid BJP leaders at the national level.
