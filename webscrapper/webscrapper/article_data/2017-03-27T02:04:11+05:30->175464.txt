NEW  : Janata Dal (United) released its   list of candidates on Sunday, giving tickets to 23 candidates, mostly Poorvanchalis. In its first and second lists, the party had announced the names of 27 and 12 candidates respectively.

 Partyâ€™s national general secretary and Delhi in-charge Delhi Sanjay Jha said JD(U) has emerged as the new anchor and hope for a large number of migrants from Bihar and Eastern UP, who are disillusioned with AAP and BJP. Jha said that candidates have started campaigning and are meeting people by going door-to-door.
