HYDERABAD: For exposing a city-based bulk drugs manufacturing plant flouting established norms through his series of complaints before both state and  , Right to Information (RTI)  , a  , is facing heat from the city police.

 He was summoned by Jeedimetla police a week ago. He was made to sit at the station for two hours, two days after a task force from Telangana state   (TSPCB) inspected the premises of Kreative Organics (P) Ltd at Jeedimetla following his complaint.
 
 This despite the fact that TSPCB in its order (a copy with TOI) issued November 11 had observed that the manufacturing plant ‘did not lift any effluent treatment plant (ETF) sludge in the past 7 months’ from its premises.
 
 In fact, the TSPCB had also found that the plant too did not have mechanism to dispose boiler ash – a potential environmental hazard -- but it intervened with the order only after the city based activist lodged a complaint with Central Pollution Control Board a month ago in October, 2016.
 
 “I was summoned by the Jeedimetla police for no reason. This happened after I filed an application with TSPCB under RTI seeking copies of its previous orders issued respect to the manufacturing plant on January 11,” recalled P Srinivas Rao. While efforts to contact C Shankar Reddy, Station House Officer (SHO) of Jeedimetla police station was futile, investigating officer V.Saidi Reddy did not respond when asked about the reasons for summoning the   to the police station.
 
 When contacted, D Narendar, environmental engineer, TSPCB and head of its rolling task force, said that they inspected the company’s premises on February 4. “We went there after the complaint . We will soon submit a report to TSPCB,” he said.
