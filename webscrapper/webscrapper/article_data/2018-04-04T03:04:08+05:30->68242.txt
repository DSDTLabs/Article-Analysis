NEW DELHI: Chief minister   has claimed that chief secretary   provided “incorrect” information to him related to infrastructure development work in unauthorised colonies and rural villages. In a letter to the chief secretary, Kejriwal expressed his unhappiness over “glaring discrepancies and infirmities” in the reports submitted to him by the  .

 According to government sources, the CS had on March 13 informed in writing about the status of roads and drains in Shivani Enclave (Kakrola) and said that the estimate had been prepared. But on March 14, the CS informed the CM that 100% work was already completed. Similar information was provided about Najafgarh’s Shyam Vihar. The government has claimed in several reports that the information provided by the CS on the same subject in two separate files has been contradictory.
 
 “Some colonies where work is complete have been shown as incomplete. This creates scope for ghost work and generation of false bills. This wrong information might have been provided with that intention. Therefore, the CS should fix responsibility and submit a report before April 5,” CM told the CS in the letter.
 
 While Prakash was not available for comment, senior officials from the joint forum of Delhi government employees came forward in support of the CS.
 
 Officials said that as per the transaction of business rules, the secretary and the minister of a department are responsible for responding to developments related to their subject. Moreover, the information regarding the development work in unauthorised colonies must be sought from the minister in-charge (in this case Satyendar Jain) as he is the head of the department.
 
 Members of the joint forum added that even if there are some discrepancies in reporting of information, the department will take action and report on it.
