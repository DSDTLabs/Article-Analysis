Except home,   probably loves being in Argentina more than anywhere else.
 
  After securing five gold medals, including four golds, during the first World Yoga Championship that he took part in Argentina in 2011, Nhehern travelled to the country that invented artistic yoga skills for a second time and ended up with another rich haul of four gold medals at the 26th Amateur and Professional World Yoga Championship in Buenos Aires on Tuesday.
  
  Nhehern, 21, won gold in two individual and two pair events, emerging champion in asanas, artistic, freestyle artistic and rhythmic yoga, competing against the best from 14 countries.
  
  “It’s a proud moment for all of us,” said his father Navin, himself a gold medallist at the World Amateur Yoga Championship in Argentina in 1998.
  
  Nhehern is expected to be on the podium for the fifth time but till late on Tuesday there was no confirmation about his performance in freestyle artistic (pair).
  
  Since 2017 when he first grabbed the limelight, Nhehern has been consistently winning top honours. His medal count now stands at 32 gold, five silver and five bronze.
  
  He is currently pursuing his physio and yoga studies at NITTE in Mangaluru and has thanked president of  , Ashok Kumar Aggarwal and choreographer trainer Venu Gopal Acharya, for their support. The Yoga Association of Goa said nothing would have been possible without the backing of the Sports Authority of Goa.
