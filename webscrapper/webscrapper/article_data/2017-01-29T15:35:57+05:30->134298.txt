MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena has asked finance minister   to lower direct and indirect tax in the ensuing budget so as to compensate for the inconvenience caused to the common man following the ban on currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. 

 "We have submitted a memorandum to Jaitley to lower the tax burden. We have suggested that income of up to Rs 5 lakh must not be taxed, that between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh should be put in the 10% tax slab and further slabs may be worked out appropriately," Shiv Sena MP   said.
 
 Sawant said that if implemented, the structure would bring great relief to the lower and middle-class tax-payers, who have been reeling under the   and  . "Stringent measures should be taken to reduce indirect taxes too. We expect that implementation of GST will address the issue of pricing to some extent," he said.
 
 Sawant said that was high time the income tax department simplifies the taxation procedure with use of technology, which could facilitate and minimize direct contact between tax-payers and collectors. Further, he said, the fixed return of 8% on deposits of up to Rs 7.5 lakh for a period of 10 years for senior citizens, as declared by PM Modi, must be enhanced to 10%.
 
 Speaking about loan defaulters, the Shiv Sena said such people should be classified and their list circulated among bankers and financial institutions to stop them from availing credit ever. "Non-performing assets do not just reflect badly in bank's account books, they also impact the nation's economy," he said.
