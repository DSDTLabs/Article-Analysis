Along with singer  , stand-up comedian   also performed on the last day of Tarang, the annual cultural festival of Lady Shri Ram College for Women. Talking to us after his performance at the college, Kenny told us, "This was my first performance in LSR. And when it was announced that I will be performing here, students kept sending me Snapchat stories and shared posts on Facebook, so I knew that it was going to be a great show."

 Though Kenny has performed in colleges like Shri Ram College of Commerce and Gargi College, he said that he does not know much about DU colleges. "I don’t know much about DU colleges. The only college I know is   and that’s also because of my friends there. I have also performed there. When I was going to perform there, my friends told me that it is an all-girls’ college and they told me the same thing about LSR," he told us with a wicked smile.
 
 During his act at LSR, the stand-up comedian kept his jokes clean, and added that he made it a point to not go dirty with his jokes. "I keep my joke very clean when performing in a college. I want the faculty to enjoy the show, even though the audience likes it when you get a little dirty, but I don’t want the faculty to get annoyed. I understand that it is an unfiltered form of entertainment, but I think we can also comfortably laugh at a clean joke," he said.
