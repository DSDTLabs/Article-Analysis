GAYA: With a view to dry up the source of funding of the Maoist, the  , along with forest department and excise officials, have launched a drive and destroyed the standing   in 30 acres of land in Barachatti police station area of the district. A case under Section 30 of the Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substances Act has been registered against 16 persons said to be active supporters of the Maoists.
 
  Besides extortion, earnings from narcotics remain an important source of Maoist funding. The money thus gained is spent on procurement of weapons and maintenance of the Peopleâ€™s  , the armed wing of the CPI (Maoist), which is the most dreaded   outfit. Several leaders of the organisation enjoy a comfortable lifestyle with expensive education for their children from the money generated with the ostensible purpose of waging war against the constitutional machinery and the Indian state.
  
  Confirming the destruction of opium crop,   said Maoists have raised opium in 150 acres of land in the area. The operation will continue till the last opium plant was uprooted, said Jha.
  
  Sources familiar with narcotic business say one acre of opium crop fetches, on an average, Rs6 lakh to the growers. The actual market value is anywhere between Rs15-20 lakh per acre. Major portion of the illicit profit is pocketed by the middlemen and the smugglers. Most of the farming is done on forest department land and, as such, identification of the real grower becomes difficult.
  
  If the ongoing operation is executed to the last details, the Maoists may lose about Rs10 crore.
