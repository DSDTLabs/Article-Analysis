INDORE: Water sports and adventure activities in Madhya Pradesh, which were restricted to the state   department, will now be made open for private players.   State Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. (MPSTDCL) is going to provide licences for   in and around water bodies like cruises, house boats, motor boats and other water sports to promote them on a large scale.

 The government has authorised MPSTDCL to provide licences to private players who are interested to host sports at major water bodies across the state. The move is a part of the department’s new tourism policy for integrated development of tourism in the state.
 
 MPSTDCL’s managing director   told TOI, “We are involving private players to promote the tourism industry and will also provide all assistance to them. He said that the department’s aim is to promote water tourism in the state. After Hanuwantia, the department aims to take it further,” he said.
 
 Upon being asked as why private players are being roped in, Rao said the corporation has its own limitations in term of promoting major activities. “We have to involve private parties if we wish to promote water tourism on large scale,” he added.
 
 “In the new 2016 tourism policy announcement, private players will be promoted through exemptions and concessions,” he said.
 
 Officials said a list of water bodies across the state where water activities can be promoted with the help of private players is being prepared and it will later be sent to the department for further initiation. “The new tourism policy also includes capital incentives for tourism projects established and wlling to operate for the next five years,” they said.
