CHENNAI: Less than two years after it took over operating control of its dog shelters, the city corporation has once again warmed up to the idea of letting private parties run the   (ABC) programme for it.

 According to corporation sources, commissioner and special officer D Karthikeyan recently instructed health department officials to explore the feasibility of working with animal welfare organisations.
 
 Subsequently, the corporation floated an expression of interest (EoI) inviting NGOs to approach the civic body with a proposal to take over the maintenance and operation of the   dog pound. The last date for submitting the EoI is March 5.
 
 “The EoI covers the dog pound and the skin care centre for diseased dogs within the Basin Bridge Lethal Chamber at Pulianthope,” a senior health department official said. When TOI asked why the corporation has had a change of mind, the official replied that the civic body wanted to “try the option” again.
 
 Animal welfare activists claimed that the civic body was finding it tough to provide round-the-clock support to the animals. “For the corporation staff this is still a 9-to-5 job. But providing care is a 24-hour job, which only dedicated organisations can do,” said Antony Rubin, a city-based animal welfare activist. He called on the corporation to increase payment on ABC surgeries. “The payment per ABC surgery has remained the same for the past 20 years, around Rs 450. They must increase this to reflect the economic situation of 2018,” Rubin added. 
 
 The corporation had a frosty relationship with the previous NGO that ran the dog pound at Pulianthope. In 2016, the NGO, People for Animals – whose chairperson is the Union minister for women and child development   – had a bitter fallout with the corporation allegedly over unpaid dues. The civic body had accused the NGO of falsifying records, which the latter denied. The incident forced the corporation to take over the ABC programme in its shelters.
