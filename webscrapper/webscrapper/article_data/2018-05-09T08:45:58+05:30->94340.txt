LUCKNOW: What happens to birds when trees are sacrificed for the sake of development in big cities? Where do birds go? And what happens to the community of humans where the birds lived? 

 These questions intrigued the mind of senior bureaucrat Anita Bhatnagar Jain so much that she penned a book on how development was taking a toll on the environment.
 
 Titled ' ', the book was formally launched by governor   here on Tuesday in the presence of chief secretary  . 
 
  Speaking about the book, which is her maiden attempt, Jain said, "Children are the main target of the book but the child inside the hearts of elders will also love the stories. The prime story relates to scores of birds who become homeless when development leads to felling of trees in big cities. Concern for environment also reflects in other stories. All stories have a moral teaching for all." 
 
 An additional chief secretary-rank officer, Jain joined the civil services in 1985. She said she got inclined towards writing during her stint in the department of languages.
 
 Jain has edited two magazines besides writing scores of travelogues. 
 
 She has also made a documentary on environment called 'Our Earth Our Home'.
