TIRUNELVELI: “It does not matter which party is in power in the Karnataka or Kerala or at the Centre. The government at the Centre has to implement the final award of the   on forming the Cauvery Management Board,” president of   (TNCC) Su   told reporters here on Friday.

 He was responding to a query if the Congress would implement the final award if it comes to power in Karnataka. 
 
 “It is not an issue of who is in power in the neighbouring state. It is an inter-state issue for 50 years. The Centre has to implement even if the Congress forms the government in Karnataka or Kerala,” he added.
 
 Thirunavukkarasar also said the Centre should recall   governor Banwarilal Purohit as he has landed himself in the midst of lots of controversies in a short stint in office. 
 
 He recalled the state-wide inspections by the governor, appointment of Anna University vice-chancellor from another State, assitant professor Nirmala Devi controversy and patting a lady journalist’s cheek.
 
 To a question, he said that remarks by BJP’s H Raja and S Ve Sheker are not only to divert the attention of the people of the state but also to fuel hate. 
 
 He asked Raja to stop personal attacks on individuals, else he would be digging the grave for his party in the state. He also said that the Centre should take action against Raja.
 
 On n the delay in the verdict over the disqualification of 18 MLAs, he said, “Justice delayed is justice denied.” 
 
 Stating that the court cannot be questioned over delay in pronouncing the verdict, he raised concern over the delay despite months after hearing both sides.
 
 “We hope the verdict is out soon. If this happens, the assembly election would be conducted with the parliamentary elections,” he added.
