SHILLONG:   ( ) troops seized a truck smuggling 22 cattleheads into neighbouring Bangladesh at Rongra in   district on Saturday. 

 According to a BSF statement issued here, the troops stopped a truck approaching Rongra and discovered it was carrying cattle to be smuggled into Bangladesh. 
 
 "The cattle carrier was identified as Kopiyan Ali, 26, a resident of Lakhipur in   district of Assam," the statement added. The BSF also seized two mobile phones with three Indian SIM cards. 
 
 "A similar seizure was made by BSF troops deployed at Lyngkhat and Baldamgiri, where 26 cattleheads were seized at the international border," the statement said.
 
 Prices of cattle have gone up in Bangladesh in recent months after the BSF stepped up vigil to check illegal supply channels to the neighbouring country.
 
 In another incident, BSF seized 114 bottles of phensedyl being smuggled into Bangladesh at Nandichar in South West Garo Hills district. The smugglers, however, managed to escape, taking advantage of the darkness.
