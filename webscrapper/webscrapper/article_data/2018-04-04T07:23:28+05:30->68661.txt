CHENNAI: At 7am, when 61-year-old   S returned from his morning walk, he saw the drug store in his neighbourhood was closed. When his neighbours told him most drug stores in the city had downed shutters in protest against the Centre’s delay in setting up   (CMB), he panicked. He needed to buy his daily dose of insulin and other medication to keep his blood pressure under control.

 The retired banker had returned from Delhi late on Monday. “I did not read about this yesterday. I was not even prepared,” he said. Santhanakumar was lucky to have neighbours who took him to the nearest hospital for the day’s medication. Pharmacies attached to hospitals remained open all day.
 
 But many in the city weren’t as lucky as Santhanakumar. Some of them had to travel long distances. “Don’t drugs come under essentials’ (essential commodities) list? Just because the state has called for a bandh, how can all drug stores close down. The nearest hospital from our house is at least 3km away,” said 30-year-old Mahesh H, working in an IT firm.
 
 However, the drug stores opened shops after 6pm.
 
 But the protest kept the men in khaki on their toes, clearing people from roads and rail tracks, diverting traffic and keeping guard of Tamil Nadu chief minister   and deputy chief minister   who were fasting at Chepauk guest house in Triplicane.
 
 Police arrested 4,645 people, including DMK cadres, members of lawyers’ association,   and Tamizhaga Farmers’ Association, who were protesting in at least 50 places. Protesters were booked under various Sections of the IPC, including 143 and 188, but were let off in the evening. There was heavy traffic jam on arterial roads, including Anna Salai and PH Road.
