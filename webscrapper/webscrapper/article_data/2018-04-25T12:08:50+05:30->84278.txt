Makkal Needhi Maiam chief   lashed out at the "  culture," which choreographer   defended, saying no woman should favour it and diminish the rights of women including his daugther in the film industry.

 "It is the right of a woman to refuse to sit, lie down or kick away that couch, and no woman shall talk in favour of it and reduce (diminish) the rights of my sister and daughter who is also in the industry," he said.
 
 His remark came when his reaction was sought to Saroj Khan defending the casting couch culture. Kamal Haasan's daughter   is a popular actress.
 
 "Woman has the right to say no to couch. Let them establish that. Let it (casting couch culture) not be justified. If someone talks supporting it, I will assume that they are talking against my sisters," he told reporters here.
 
 When  's attention was drawn to Congress leader Renuka Chowdhury's remark that casting couch was the "bitter truth" of not just the film industry but all work spaces and even Parliament was not immune to it, he said it was yet another corruption in politics.
 
 "We want to do away with it," the actor said.
 
 Asked if his party would contest local body polls whenever it was announced, he said "absolutely that is what we are aiming at."
