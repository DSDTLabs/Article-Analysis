CHENNAI: Making a phone call from   may not be possible as it takes between 4 and 23 minutes for radio signals to reach the Earth, but the evidence of water and favourable surface conditions can make the red planet a home for the human race.

 Space experts who interacted with students in an event organised by   on Friday , said that many nations, including the US and the  , were working towards establishing human presence beyond Earth.
 
 Shaun Moss, founder of  , said the Netherlands was involved in research to make survival in Mars possible by growing crops and cereals in soil similar to that on the red planet.Vegetables like radish, peas and tomatoes were grown and tested for heavy metals.In 2015,   claimed that it had strong evidence of intermittent water flow on Mars.
 
 “Mars has certain chemi cals in its soil that are toxic to humans. But a compost out of vegetable and human waste mixed with Martian dust can make the soil fertile.This can make humans survive independently on Mars,“ he said.
 
 Moss said that among the countries working on taking men to Mars, India would have a big role to play as it was the first country to reach Mars in its very first attempt.“India has also been successful in reaching the moon. So, it will definitely have a big role to play ,“ he added.
 
 Moss said there were many other challenges involved in colonising Mars including extreme temperatures, high atmospheric pressure and radiation.
