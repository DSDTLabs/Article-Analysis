Panaji: A site selection team from the Union human resource development (HRD) ministry is expected in Goa this month to inspect the new land identified by the state to establish the permanent Goa campus of the   ( ). Sources said that the site selection committee will be taken to only one site of 9-10 lakh sq m located in Sanguem taluka, even though some others sites in Ponda and Cacora were earlier in consideration.

 Officials said that most of the land identified in   in Sanguem is already in the government’s possession, which will make the land acquisition process easier, once and if the site gets the HRD team’s nod.
 
 IIT Goa began operations in 2016 and has been functioning from within the   campus since then.
 
 In 2016, land was identified for the IIT in Loliem in  , which was also inspected and approved by the site selection committee of the HRD. IIT Goa was given the go-ahead based on this site’s selection to begin operations in Goa. But opposition to the land being utilised to construct the permanent campus of the IIT then emerged from locals, who said their water sources, besides the eco-sensitive plateau where the land is located, would be affected.
 
 “The Sanguem land is as good as finalised by the state government. Once it is approved by the HRD team, the government will begin the further procedure,” said an official.
 
 Currently, IIT Goa offers BTech programmes in mechanical engineering, computer science, and electrical engineering with an intake of 30 each. The institute is moving to its third year of operations, which means adding another batch of students to its numbers. The institute is also going to introduce a fourth BTech degree in mathematics and computing from the next academic year 2018-19, and it is also in the process of recruiting more faculty. All this means that the IIT may be staring at a space crunch soon if the process to establish its new campus does not begin soon.
