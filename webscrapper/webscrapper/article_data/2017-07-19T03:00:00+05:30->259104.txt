It’s not an adaptation of any published detective novel. Though it involves an investigation, the film has no private investigator.
 
 
 
 
 Rationally and coolly. I put forward my arguments and they accepted most of my points. However, I had to abide by some of the proposed cuts or else our release would have got indefinitely postponed.
 
  
 
 
 
 It’s not new. Historically, there have been attacks on freedom of speech and it’s been widely talked about. This happens because films depend on individual subjectivity, which differs from person to person. Things would be less complicated if the body doesn’t censor and just certifies. I think censorship should be left to the viewers. However, there’s still room for discussion and that’s a good thing.
 
 
 
 
 There’re authors who take long to finish a book. There are directors who take longer than me to make a film. I’m not a prolific filmmaker. I can’t make many films. I’m lazy — not when I’m working but when I’m not. I’ve always been a slow learner. Moreover, it takes time to talk to producers, find appropriate cast etc. Also, I wait for the right time of the year. 
 
 Produced by Friends Communication, Mundus Services Pvt Ltd, Indibily Films, Meghnadbodh Rohoshyo will release on July 21.
