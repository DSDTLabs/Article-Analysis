EDINBURGH: A Scottish addiction clinic has begun treating people who are hooked on trading cryptocurrencies.

 
 Traders can become addicted to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as their volatile price fluctuations can be as thrilling but potentially costly as gambling, according to therapists at   clinic near Edinburgh.
 
 Cryptocurrency addicts are offered treatments such as a 12-step programme, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), trauma therapy and equine therapy.
 
  Burn, a gambling therapist at  , said, “The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler.
 
 “It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation,” he said.
 
 Castle Craig has treated over 10,000 patients for various addictions since it opened in 1988, and says the majority have gone on to achieve long-term abstinent recovery. Prices start from £ 1,360 (Rs 1,22,346) per week for an extended treatment programme, and detox and intensive care starts from £ 2,975 (Rs 2,67,632) per week at the clinic.
 
 Some treatments at the centre will be led by  , a former gambling and cocaine addict, who said introducing a life structure is key for addicts.
 
 “I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don’t like the world they’re in,” he said.
 
 “The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them realise that they’re not alone.”
