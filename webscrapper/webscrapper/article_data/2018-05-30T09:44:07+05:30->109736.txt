GUWAHATI: Authorities of   and several other organisations have criticised singer   of ‘Ya Ali’ fame for wrongly claiming that Bollywood actor Govinda had   at the famous shrine.

 
 “Govinda spent just about 15 minutes at the temple. He didn’t make any sacrifice,” clarified Bhupesh Sarma, a temple committee official. “If anyone wants to perform a sacrifice, we can’t stop him from doing it as this is an age-old ritual,” he added. He added that about 20,000 people visit the temple every day and only 50 want to perform sacrifice.
 
 Govinda had visited the temple on Monday.
 
 Zubeen Garg, who is a singer, music producer, film director and actor from Assam’s Jorhat, had earlier said, “I heard that Bollywood actor Govinda had sacrificed a buffalo here. I would say learn to sacrifice yourself. Maa Kamakhya never seeks any sacrifice. I have always spoken against animal sacrifice. It should be stopped.”
 
 Sarma added, “Zubeen is a respected and very popular musician. He should stay away from making such remarks. We don’t appreciate such remarks which can hurt religious sentiments.”
 
 Zubeen, who has been trolled on social media for his comment, remained unfazed. “This is my personal opinion. I don’t appreciate animal sacrifice. That’s it,” he told the media on Tuesday.
 
 Condemning Garg’s remarks, Sadou Asom Devalaya Sangha secretary Kailash Sarma said, “We warn him (Zubeen) not to make such statements in future.” Another organization, Friends of Kamakhya has demanded an apology from the singer.
