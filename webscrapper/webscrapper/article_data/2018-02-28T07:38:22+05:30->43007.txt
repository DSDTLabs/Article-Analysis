PATIALA: Father of a Dalit girl student, who was allegedly harassed for not letting upper caste boys cheat in the exam at a government school in   village in Patiala in April 2017, alleged that he was attacked by the family members of the boys.

 Girl’s father Hari Singh alleged that he was assaulted by two men when he was returning from Dera Baba Khathi Ram to   village.
 
 Hari alleged that he was attacked by uncles of one of the boys, accused of harassing his daughter. “I was returning from a dera when the accused pounced on me and my brother. They hit us with a brick, leaving us injured. One cop, who was deployed to provide security to us after my daughter complained about the incident, didn’t help us when we were assaulted by   and Beant Singh. It seemed as if he was involved in the conspiracy to let them attack me. I am being forced by the police, administrative officials and a number of villagers, supporting the accused, to reach a compromise,” he alleged.
 
 Nabha deputy superintendent of police (DSP)   said a complaint has been received from Hari and a case would be registered after investigation. He said the complainant did not mention anything about the cop not helping them.
