CHANDIGARH:   on Monday recommended holding a Vigi lance Bureau probe or slap ping a criminal case against an IPS officer for allegedly extorting Rs 19.5 lakh from two farmers by threatening to implicate them in a murder case.

  and  , aged 30, levelled these allegations against 2007-batch Punjab Police officer Inderbir Singh. The complainants, who belong to Longowal in Sangrur, said Dhanwant allegedly paid Rs 14 lakh while Babbu gave Rs 5 lakh to the officer.
 
 This allegedly happened during Inderbir's tenure as Sangrur SSP before he was shunted out to headquarters as AIG (personnel) last week.
 
 According to a three-page report prepared by Sangrur cops, the farmers met Inderbir when he was probing the murder of 25-year-old financier by five gangsters on February 16 this year.
 
 All five gangsters, including   alias Babli Randhawa, were subsequently arrested. Dhanwant and Babbu, who were acquaintances of the gangsters, were picked up for interrogation until the gangsters were caught.
 
 Sangrur cops say Dhanwant was forced to pledge one-and-half acre of agricultural land to arrange Rs 3 lakh and borrowed the remaining Rs 11 lakh from his cousins. The report has been sent to DIG (Patiala Range) Sukhchain Singh Gill and IG (Patiala Zone) Amardeep Singh Rai. It will be sent to Punjab Police chief DGP Suresh Arora for further action. 
 
 Sangrur cops have also sought police protection for the two farmers.
 
 Inderbir's name was in the panel sent by Punjab Police for the post of Chandigarh SSP to Punjab governor. This is second controversy that Inderbir has courted after he posted out 20 SHOs in Sangrur, minutes after he was shunted out. The officer told TOI, “I will talk to senior officers. The allegations are false. Sangrur cops are free to do whatever they want.“
