Sivaganga: Two spectators were gored to death and 24 others sustained injuries during a manjuvirattu event conducted in a village near Thirukoshtiyur in Sivaganga district on Thursday. The deceased were identified as C Periyasamy, 36, from Panayanenthalpatti near Melur in Madurai district and A Sevarkodiyan, 49, S V Mangalam near Tirupathur.  The annual event, conducted on the occasion of Manickanachi Amman temple festival in Kandaramanickam, began on Thursday morning after obtaining permission from the Sivaganga district administration. According to police sources, only 88 bulls were registered to take part in the event. Out of them, only 66 were declared fit to enter the ‘vaadivasal’. A total of 46 bull tamers had registered their names. However, at least 200 bulls were let loose outside the arena, causing chaos and posing threat to the lives of hundreds of spectators who had come from various places from Sivaganga, Madurai and Ramanathapuram districts. From the time the event was flagged off, reports of injuries started pouring in. Periasamy and Sevarkodiyon, who were grievously hurt, were immediately shifted to Tirupathur government hospital, after first aid.  Of the 24 more injured, only two were declared with injuries of serious nature and sent to the Sivaganga medical college hospital. The rest were treated in the medical camps arranged at the arena. The bodies of the deceased were kept in Tirupattur Government Hospital for autopsy. Police claimed that adequate security arrangement was in place, but were not sure whether the victims were gored by bulls released in the arena or by those let loose outside. Thirukostiyur police registered cases and are investigating.
