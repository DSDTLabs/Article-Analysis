Be it a kiss or an intimate scene, TV actors no longer shy away from experimenting and going bold on the small screen. The proof of it is the recent video that   has posted on her Instagram account from the shoot of her show  .

  
  
 In the video, Jennifer (Maya) can be seen serenading   (Arjun) by dancing to "Manali Trance" from Lisa Haydon’s film 'The Shaukeens'. Posting the pole dance video, Jennifer wrote: "A girls gotta do what a girls gotta do... especially when she's a girl named #Maya. The things we do for love... Screening tonight on #Beyhadh , watch Maya's next manoeuver to lure Arjun."
 
  
  
 
 Since Beyhadh is a show about obsessive love, the leading pair has been open to doing intimate scenes. Jennifer can be often seen posting clippings of the upcoming sequences on her social media accounts. Season 2 of Beyhadh is certainly more passionate and intense than the previous. 
 
 In the new plot in Beyhadh, Arjun and Maya have separated from Arjun’s family and Maya has gone back to her psychotic self, after losing her child during pregnancy.
