CHENNAI:The all-party and farmers' meet convened by chief minister   on Thursday unanimously decided to meet Prime Minister   and step up pressure on the Centre for setting up the   management board to ensure monthly release of Cauvery water by   as outlined in the tribunal award. 

  The meeting also decided to take necessary action (of moving review petition in the apex court) against reduction of the state's share, after consulting legal experts. The all-party meeting, held after 11 years, saw constructive debate and discussions and rare camaraderie among parties, reports Julie Mariappan . 
 
  The six-hour meeting at the secretariat, attended by 39 political parties/outfits and 14 farmers' associations/representatives, passed three resolutions, including seeking constitution of a permanent mechanism to ensure water release as per the Supreme Court order. "A delegation led by chief minister, with all party leaders, farmers representatives and MPs of the state will meet PM in person and urge him to implement the positive aspects of the court verdict for the state immediately," a resolution said. The suggestion initially mooted by DMK working president M K Stalin was endorsed by all the participants. 
 
 Another resolution urged the Centre to set up the all-powerful Cauvery board and regulation committee within six weeks as directed by the Supreme Court for implementing the final award of the tribunal - that was later modified by the apex court.
