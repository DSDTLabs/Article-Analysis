AHMEDABAD: To curb  , city cops have begun to raid areas like Chharanagar, Hansol and  , known as hubs of   breweries in the city. About 150 cops in six teams raided all three areas on Friday.

 Additional commissioner of police, Sector 2, Ashok Yadav, said their aim was to eliminate production and sale of country liquor in the area. “We have registered five cases in the raids conducted late on Friday evening. Three persons have been arrested and about 30 litres of “wash” used to brew liquor have been seized from the accused.”
 
 Locals, however, say they are forced by situation to brew country liquor, as they lack alternative skills to earn a livelihood, and there’s no help from the administration on that account.
 
 Yadav didn’t accept the view and said the administration has planned to impart skills for alternative employment for those engaged in brewing country liquor in the area.
 
 “We will provide them training and skills according to their preferences. We have plans to provide the women with alternative livelihood, and will abolish the age-old practice of brewing liquor in the area,” Yadav said.
