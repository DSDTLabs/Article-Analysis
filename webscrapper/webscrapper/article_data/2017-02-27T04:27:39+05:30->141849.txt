Neil Nitin  's engagement ceremony on Tuesday, as he had told us earlier, had all the elements of a fairy tale. Held at Radisson Blu Udaipur Palace Resort and Spa, the entire venue was done up in shades of pink and lavender for the fairy-tale theme of the evening. While Neil looked dapper in a purple jacket, Rukmini was gorgeous in a flowy lavender gown.

 Neil's father, singer Nitin Mukesh, played emcee for the evening, which started with Neil's grandfather Mukesh's famous song 'Ek Pyaar Ka Nagma Hai' being played in the background. Neil went down on his knees, held Rukmini's hand and proposed to her, to which she smiled and said yes. The couple then took vows and exchanged rings before cutting a cake.
