Nagpur: The bar room number one at the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court, renovated with contributions from lawyers, was inaugurated by justices Zaka Haq and Atul Chandurkar on Thursday. The programme was organized by High Court Bar Association (HCBA).

 HCBA chief Anil Kilor, who floated the idea of renovating the room by contributions from lawyers who sit there, said new wooden flooring, tables, chairs and integrated sound system have been put in place and added that this is one of the best in the country. Almost 70% of renovation has already been completed and the remaining work will be completed by May, he added.
 
 Advocate Ganesh Khanzode, who sits in bar room-1, said, “We received overwhelming response from lawyers when we first told them about the idea. Now lawyers in other bar rooms are also coming forward for renovation with contributions. Senior lawyer Sunil Manohar was very supportive of the initiative.”
 
 Kilor said that the work on installing solar panels will begin in a few days. “We want to make the courthouse run on clean electricity.” 
 
 Lawyer Nitin Kamborkar, who also sits in bar room 1, said, “Other members should also take an initiative. The renovated bar room gives clients a good impression and also some space to interact with counsels.”
