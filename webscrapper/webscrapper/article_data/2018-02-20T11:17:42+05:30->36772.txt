 The civic body is contemplating a scholarship for   from such weaker sections who find it difficult to secure admission in leading international institutes due to lack of funds.
 
  
 A proposal has already been tabled before the PMC standing committee and is expected to be discussed on Tuesday. As per the proposal, eligible students will be chosen and each student will get an aid of Rs 2 lakh. It will be a one-time payment.
 
 “Bright students, who wish to pursue higher studies  , will be entitled to this scheme. The scholarships will be given for postgraduate studies in fields such as medicine, commerce, IT, engineering and law,” said a PMC official.
 
 The women and child welfare committee has given its green signal to the project. It also made changes to the primary proposal to widen the scope of the scheme. “Our committee has decided to increase the scope of this scheme. Earlier, the programme was for five students of the reserved categories. We suggested five more youngsters from other categories, but with a poor financial background, must be added to the scheme,” said Rani Bhosale, head of women and child welfare committee.
