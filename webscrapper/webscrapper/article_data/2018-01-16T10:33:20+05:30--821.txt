BHARUCH: Bharuch   MP Mansukh   has lodged a complaint with the   district police alleging that he has been receiving death threats over phone. 

 Vasava told the police that he had received more than 50 phone calls at his residence from unidentified callers who threatened him to kill. “During the winter session of Parliament, I strongly represented the issue of investigating illegal and bogus certificates issued to Rabari, Bharwad, Charan and   communities as Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Saurashtra. These communities are getting undue advantage of reservation in government jobs, education etc. They are misusing the benefits for the past many years as some officer has misinterpreted the 1956 notification and wrongly issued certificates, which is not in favour of the tribals. These people are behind the threatening calls to me,” he said.
 
 “I have a written complaint to the superintendent of police on Saturday and have sought protection,” Vasava added. In-charge   said, “We have received the complaint and we have begun investigation in the case.”
