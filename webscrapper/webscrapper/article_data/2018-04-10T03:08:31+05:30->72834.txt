MUMBAI:  , the project implementing agency for the   metro route project, has got approval to put up noise barriers rather than plant trees around the   I car shed at Andheri. 

 Two years after the state urban development department issued a notification inviting objections and suggestions, it has approved MMRDA's request to waive off the condition for a 30-metre buffer zone around the Metro I car shed. There will be no tree plantation either.
 
  "Instead, MMRDA shall provide necessary noise abatement measures to reduce noise pollution at their own cost and all along the periphery of the metro car depot...," says the urban development department;s notification of last week . tnn
