 Speaking on the occasion, Pawar said, “As per India’s agreement with Bhutan, we have deputed our army on the Bhutan border, but China is doing mischief. They want us to remove our army point from there and so they have brought their armed force. India did not cross its limits or enter someone else’s border. War is not the solution. This issue should be resolved amicably. And it also means that we should not give even an inch of our land to anybody.”
 
 Pawar went on to state the situation during 1962 war was different. Now, things have changed to a great extent and efforts should be made to resolve the issue. The war may prove too costly for us.
 
 Speaking about the farmers issues, senior Pawar said that the country’s economy can steadily progress, if our farmers become capable and strong. He said, “Many people ask why the farmers loan should be waived off. They should understand that giving them loan waiver would have positive impact and we will see the results in near future.”
