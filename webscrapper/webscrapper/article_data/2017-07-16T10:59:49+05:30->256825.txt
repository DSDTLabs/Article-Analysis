PATNA: The widening rift between RJD and JD(U) became evident on Friday after deputy chief minister   skipped an official World Youth Skills Day function of the state government chaired by CM  . Tejashwi’s name plaque was initially there beside the CM’s chair, but it was removed before Nitish reached the venue. The Bihar CM also refused to speak to the media.

 Tejashwi, who is RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s younger son, was listed as a “distinguished guest” for the event and his name was also mentioned in the invitation cards. Tejashwi is apparently in the line of fire over increasing pressure from the opposition BJP on Nitish to either drop him from his cabinet or seek his resignation. 
 
 However, RJD spokesman Manoj Jha said Tejashwi could not attend the function as he was unwell.
 
 Nitish, who is also JD(U) national president, avoided sitting beside labour resources department minister Vijay Prakash of RJD on the dais and water resources department minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh’s chair was placed beside the CM’s. Vijay, too, seemed defiant despite being the only RJD minister at the function and he mentioned Tejashwi in his address even though the deputy CM was not present. 
 
 Many present at the function explained it as Nitish’s discomfort in sitting beside an RJD minister amid the ongoing rift between the two alliance partners.
 
 Incidentally, it was the first public event where Nitish and Tejashwi had to share the dais since the CBI raids on Lalu family on July 7 in connection with a land-for-railways hotels case. 
 
 Other JD(U) ministers on the dais included industries minister Jai Kumar Singh, urban development and housing department minister Maheshwar Hazari and social welfare department minister Kumari Manju Verma.
