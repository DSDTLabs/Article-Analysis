 is single and in no hurry to mingle. The actress, who had a bitter break-up with ' ' actor  , says she is in a happy space.
“I am very much single and not actively looking for a partner. I believe in God and his plans for me. If I am destined to stay single, I wouldn’t mind that either,” she says, adding, “But being human, I will crave for companionship at some point. So, I have decided to wait for my godsend partner. From now on, I will expect less from people and more from God. Whatever happens, happens for the better.”
 While that’s profound and candid, Rati clams up the moment you ask about her break-up. She says, “I have never spoken about my personal life and will not do it even now,” is all she will say.
 Further, the actress vehemently denies being in a relationship with Nashik-based pilot  , who she apparently met and fell in love with last August. “This is baseless; I don’t even know him that well. I met him just once through a common friend and that too, when my whole family was present. There is nothing more to it,” she asserts.
 While marriage is nowhere on the horizon at present, Rati is sure she will never tie the knot with someone from the glamour industry. “I will not marry an actor. The problem is, two actors have too much in common and there will be nothing beyond acting to talk about," she signs off.
