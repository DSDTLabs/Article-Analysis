RANCHI: The   introduced by the   and   for principals, teaching and   of constituent and affiliated colleges of the   (RU) to curb absenteeism became defunct in several institutes. 

 "We have installed two biometric attendance machines outside my chamber a month ago, but the machine stopped working after 10 days. We are planning to purchase new biometric attendance machines. For the time being, we are registering the attendance of our staff members manually," Doranda College principal V S Tiwary said.
 
 Ranchi Women's College principal Manju Sinha said, "We have installed the machine two years ago but the machines became defunct. Despite installing another three machines we began facing similar problems." She added, "Once we install the new ones it will become mandatory for our staff to register their attendance through them, else their salaries will be deducted."
 
 Ranchi University vice-chancellor R K Pandey has issued a directive after the matter of defunct biometric systems was brought to his notice. "Such mistakes cannot be compromised. Biometric attendance is compulsory and colleges that are found not using the system will face strict action. The salaries of these teachers will be stopped immediately. If the machines have become defunct, it is the responsibility of the college principals to install the new ones," Pandey said.
 
 Ajay Kumar Singh, secretary, state higher education department, said, "We are going to find out how all the machines have suddenly stopped working. We will write to the V-Cs of all colleges to install new ones."
