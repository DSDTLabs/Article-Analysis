KOLKATA: After their poll success in tribal-dominated Jangalmahal, the   central leadership is wooing the Kurmi community.

 
 A delegation of 15 Kurmi leaders are scheduled to meet BJP national president  , union tribal development minister Juwel Oraon and President   to demand their reinclusion in the tribal list.
 
 The Kurmis were removed from the central list in 1931. Community leaders, however, insist the Cetre had wrongly declassified them.
 
 â€œJharkhand BJP MP   has managed an appointment with Shah," said  , secretary Adibasi Kurmi Samaj.
