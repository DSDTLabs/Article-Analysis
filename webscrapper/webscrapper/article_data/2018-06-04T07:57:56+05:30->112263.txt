BENGALURU: On a quiet Sunday morning, chants of Vedic hymns (mantras) filled the air at Vidhana Soudha.

 
 It took some time for people in the vicinity to realize that the smoke was emanating from the   kunda in   G Parameshwara’s chamber (rooms 327 and 328) on the third floor of Vidhana Soudha.
 
 The homa was conducted under the guidance of Parameshwara’s wife Kanika   for over two hours. And not just the public, even media was denied entry into the secretariat during that period.
 
 Though Parameshwara stayed away from the rituals, the passage near his chamber was filled with some close relatives and friends, said sources.
 
 Ministers performing low-key pujas in their official chambers at the start of their tenure isn’t uncommon at the Soudha.
 
 However, for the first time in the state’s history, BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa had set a precedent by beginning his tenure as CM in 2008 by performing a homa-havana in his official chamber.
 
 In 2016, former water resources minister MB Patil drew flak for performing ‘parjanya homa’ to appease the rain god, with the opposition BJP accusing the government of practising “double standards” on such matters. The minister had performed the rituals even as then chief minister Siddaramaiah, known for his rational outlook, was propagating the need for an anti-superstition bill, which was eventually passed in the assembly in a diluted form.
