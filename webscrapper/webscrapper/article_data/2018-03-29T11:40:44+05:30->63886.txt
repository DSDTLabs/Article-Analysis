NEW DELHI: In line with expectations of an early and hot summer, temperatures in the capital soared to an eight-year high for the month of   on Wednesday, with the   hitting 40 degrees Celsius for the first time in the season at Palam.

 The day’s maximum   at Palam was   degrees C while Safdarjung recorded 38.6 degrees. Both were the highest recorded March temperatures at the respective stations since 2010. The readings were as much as eight degrees above normal at Palam and seven at Safdarjung. 
 
 Officials from the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) in Delhi said the temperature rise over the last few days has been due to clear skies and a reduction in wind speeds, further aided by anti-cyclonic dry winds from Rajasthan.
  
  
 “The maximum is currently around 7 degrees above normal for this time of the season, mainly due to a reduction in wind speed over the last few days and clear skies. Delhi is seeing anti-cyclonic winds at the lower level from Rajasthan which is then turning towards UP through Delhi,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at RWFC.
 
 Stations across the city recorded similarly high temperatures on Wednesday, with the mercury touching 39.9 degrees at Ridge and 39.2 at Ayanagar.
 
 Met officials, however, said relief lasting two-three days was expected with easterly winds likely to start blowing from March 30, bringing the temperature down to around 35 degrees Celsius.
 
 Met officials said Delhi will see a drop in temperatures till April 1. The mercury is expected to start rising again thereafter due to a fresh western disturbance.
 
 “A western disturbance is approaching J&K again which will see temperatures rise from April 1, however the next few days will see a gradual drop till it maximum reaches around 35-36 degrees,” Srivastava said.
