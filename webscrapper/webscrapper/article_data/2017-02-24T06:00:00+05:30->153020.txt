 is relieved to have begun shooting for the upcoming Naga Chaitanya-starrer. “I’ve been waiting to get started with this film for a long time now but the shooting kept getting postponed for a variety of reasons. We finally started shooting a couple of days ago and it feels great,” says the actress who is teaming up with   again after  .
“I met Chaitanya for the first time on the sets of Manam. I had a very small role in the film and we shot for a very small period of time, but everyone around said we make a great pair. As it turned out I ended up being paired opposite   garu in  . And now I’ve been cast as Naga Chaitanya’s love interest. It’s one of those funny coincidences,” says Lavanya.
 The actress sounds quite gung ho about her role in the film. “It’s a family drama with a mix of comedy and suspense. Yes there will be a very cutesy romantic track between me and Naga Chaitanya. And I’m not playing a village belle in this movie. I play a working girl who is bold, smart and comfortable in her own skin. A multi-tasker, who is very supportive of her man’s mission in life. It’s a very character driven role that will strike a chord with the audiences,” adds the actress signing off.
