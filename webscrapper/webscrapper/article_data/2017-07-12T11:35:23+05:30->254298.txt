Mirror (January 31) was the first to report that director Pawan Kirpalani is all set to kick off a sequel to his critically acclaimed 2016 psychological thriller, ' ', featuring   as Mehak who suffers from agoraphobia (fear of open spaces). Now, Mirror has learnt that   will topline Part 2. His character suffers from aviophobia (fear of flying).

  
  
 "After Nawaz had wrapped up  , we met at his residence and jammed on this script. He immediately gave his nod. Phobia will always have a high-calibre actor as performance is paramount. Nawaz suits this character perfectly," reasons producer  , adding that they had planned on a sequel even before the release of the original.
 
 He goes on to inform that the film will begin with Nawaz boarding a flight and the entire movie is set in a plane. "We will begin work on a set once we lock the dates," says Viki, pointing out that the shoot will begin either in October or in February after Nawaz finishes Sanjay Puran Singh Chauhan’s sci-fi space adventure 'Chanda Mama Door Ke' in which he plays an astronaut. "He will start prepping for our film closer to the shoot," he added.
 
 Does Nawaz himself have any phobia? Viki quips with a laugh, “He has phobia for bad scripts."
