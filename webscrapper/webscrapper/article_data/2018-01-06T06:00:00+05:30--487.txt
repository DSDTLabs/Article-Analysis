It was ironic. The very illegal flexis put by TRS leaders at Moosarambagh to welcome  , ended up earning his wrath. The incident occurred when the Minister for IT was on a visit to inaugurate the National Park for Differently Abled at  , when he noticed the flex boards put up on the railway bridge by his party persons. Furious, the minister ordered the flexis to be taken down immediately, only after that did the   spring into action.
The party persons were Corporator of   and   leader Srinivas, whose enthusiasm was doused as the GHMC enforcement team fined them `50,000 and `25,000 respectively. 
 Putting up such flexis is illegal in the city and punishable under section 674 of HMC Act. “KTR has always been vocal about his dislike for such flexis which are bad for the environment and dangerous for commuters. But implementation is the challenge as we can see in this case where the TRS corporator himself did it, making the GHMC staff reluctant to take action on their own. Last year the GHMC had taken down plenty from city, but looks like old habits die hard,” adds Major Shiva Kiran, Vice President of United Federation of Resident Welfare Association. 
 Hopefully GHMC takes cue from this and emboldens itself against the many political banners that cropped up for New year.
