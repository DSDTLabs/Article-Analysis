BELAGAVI: Dnyaneshwar Mulay, secretary,  ,   and overseas Indian affairs,  , said that   is like a shark that is eating up languages like Marathi,  ,  , and other   rapidly.

 “Three generations of not using one’s mother tongue are enough to destroy one’s language,” he said, speaking after inaugurating the 33rd   organized by the Marathi Sahitya Sangh in Kadoli near   on Sunday.
 
 He said the English language cannot be a parameter for one to prove his ability or talent. “It is big lie that a person who has studied in their mother tongue will not get employment. I have worked in Japan, Maldives and France, and I have seen their love for their mother tongue, which they use 100% of the time,” he said. 
 
 Mule said that the ministry of external affairs has adopted the use of the national language in its offices and embassies.
 
 A lecture on “Swarajyache Shiledar” by Sourabh Karade of Pune, a poetry recital by budding poets, and a session on “poets of the motherland” was held on the occasion.
 
 Prior to the meet, an attractive procession of children dressed as Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, Savitri Bai Phule, Chhatrapati Shivaji, Rani Channamma and other personalities was taken out. Dhol tasha, traditional vaarkari bhajan and horses added to the spirit of the procession.
