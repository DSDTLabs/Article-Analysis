CHENNAI: Even as sporadic protests by students and others against the bus fare hike continues across the state,   refused to intervene in the issue, saying it was a policy decision of the government. It, however, directed the government to display fare charts on all buses indicating ticket prices for various stops on the route.

 “There is no doubt that the bus fare hike, would affect people. However, fair fixation is a matter of policy, in which the high court cannot interfere,” the first bench of Chief Justice   and Abdul Quddhose said on Wednesday. “This is a matter of policy, it has to be determined by taking into account the expenses incurred in running the bus services including the payment of wages to officers and employees, who operate the services. What part of that expenditure, if at all, would be absorbed by the government by way of subsidy is a matter of government policy,” the judges said.
 
 Representing the government, advocate-general   submitted that the hike had been announced in view of the acute financial crisis faced by state-owned  . 
 
 Following the January 9 announcement by the state government of increase in ticket fares, two PILs were moved seeking a rollback of the hike terming the move unfair towards the people.
