VISAKHAPATNAM: With   increasingly logging onto   to connect with friends and family, Vizag-based startup   has developed a social networking site through which netizens can not only connect with friends but also earn   and purchase gifts based on the time they spend on the portal.

 Founder of the website Parkpays.com Ravi Kumar K said, “For the first time, e-commerce companies are being introduced into a social networking site. Using Parkpays, users can connect with friends and family as well as get rewarded in the form of credit points for signing up on the website, posting information and sharing and commenting on the feed. Using these credit points, users can purchase a variety of gifts available on the website."
 
 Mentioning that around 1,200 members have already registered on the website after it was launched in January, Kumar said the app version has also seen around 500 downloads. "A lot of people spend time on social networking sites. We want to offer rewards for people who spend time on our website," he said.
 
 Elaborating on the business model, Ravi Kumar said, "As our user base grows, we will offer a market for companies to showcase their products on the website. In future, we will also provide an option for e-commerce companies to provide coupons to users and the website can also act as a marketing platform for different companies."
 
 He said users can also create blogs on the website as well as use it as a marketplace to showcase their goods and wide variety of services being offered to their customers.
 
 At the same time, Ravi Kumar said, “In the coming days, we also want to provide technical support for students.” He said ParkPays will provide internship opportunities for students in order to help them improve on their technical skills.
