Surat: A young woman, who was pregnant, consumed poison and ended her life in Udhna area of the city after her husband was found dead on way home from work on Friday. The woman in her suicide note said she couldn’t think of living without her husband and hence ended her life. She said no one should be troubled in her family for her decision. 

 Shrikant Rajkaran Mishra, 29, a native of Uttar Pradesh, who got married to Nisha seven months ago after an intense courtship, had recently shifted to the city. The couple was living in a housing society on Gopalak Road in Udhna for the past two months. Shrikant, who worked in a mill, had left for home on Thursday night. However, he didn’t reach home and Nisha started a search for him. Shrikant was found dead near Bombay Dyeing House on Friday. 
 
 When Nisha was informed about this, she went home and consumed poison. Shrikant’s friends feared that he may have been murdered. 
 
 Udhna police said they are waiting for the postmortem reports to proceed with their investigation in the case of death of husband and wife.
