TRICHY: The   has directed state authorities to shut down hotels,   without provisions for proper parking. The court passed the order based on a PIL filed two years ago.

 Social activists say that if the order is implemented, it would de congest the city due to the   meant for parking.
 S Pushpavanam, secretary, Consumer Protection Council, Tamil Nadu, said that   must take action against several hotels in the Central bus stand which don't have provisions for parking space. As an example, he mentioned a restaurant in Thillai Nagar, where the entire road is jam packed with two-wheelers of the customers.
 
 He said motorists should not be allowed to use public spaces for parking because of the increasing number of vehicles in the city.
 "It is well and good if the city and district administration come forward to crack down on violators. If not, we will approach the court with a PIL directing the authorities," said member of the Road Safety council M Sekaran. He had raised the issue during the previous safety meeting chaired by the district collector and transport and traffic officials but his plea only fell on deaf ears, he added. Parking voilators are the main reason the traffic is slow in the city, Sekaran said.
 
 He also blamed builders for the congestion. Several builders obtain permission to construct structures by giving provisions for parking. But when they actually build, they don't provide any parking space.
 
 However, an official from the Trichy corporation said that building violations had come down in the last five years. Buildings which are more than a decade old are found to have several violations, he said. People too are voluntarily violating rules by parking vehicles on roads as they are reluctant to park vehicles in the basement. He said they were working on creating onsite parking facilities in the city.
