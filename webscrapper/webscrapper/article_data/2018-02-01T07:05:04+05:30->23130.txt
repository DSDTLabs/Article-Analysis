KOLKATA: Two days after TOI reported on how designated   and   passengers have been introduced by the traffic police,   hinted they would like to keep some of the designated points “flexible” and allow riders to alight or board a few metres before or after these locations.

 Sources said studies are also underway to add new areas and bring more roads under this scheme.
 
 “The decision will not be reversed. But we will definitely be looking at to user response. Certain micro-level changes will be allowed. As a rule, we have identified only those points which offer maximum width and minimum disruption. For any minor change, we have to find a place with equal width and lying nowhere near crossings,” said a senior officer.
 
 Traffic department officials said they would be in a better position to talk about the findings of these surveys a couple of weeks later. “It is still early days and we have just finished setting up the road furniture. We are waiting for the individual guards to report on the identified points. Accordingly, new roads might be added to our list,” said an officer. He added that with an exponential rise in the number of appcabs, they were trying to keep the main thoroughfares free of snarls without inconveniencing anyone.
 
 So far, 108 points have been selected on 26 thoroughfares, like Central Avenue, Chowringhee, Strand Road, Diamond Harbour Road, CIT Road and AJC Bose Road. Drivers who stop on these major roads at places other than at the 108 designated points, face a Rs 100 fine for the first offence and will have to fork out Rs 300 for every subsequent one; repeat offenders stand the risk of losing their licence.
 
 However, there is no bar on picking up or dropping off passengers on roads apart from these 26.
