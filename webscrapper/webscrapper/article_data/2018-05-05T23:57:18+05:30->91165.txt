Ahmedabad: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has decided that 49-odd buses of the Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service ( ) will use the bus rapid transit (BRT) track on the road from Shivranjani Crossroads to Ghuma village.

 Officials said the decision to have these buses use the BRT track from Shivranjani was taken to smoothen traffic on the road beside the BRT corridor. Officials said AMTS buses were causing congestion in the Bopal area where haphazard parking is exacerbating traffic problems.
 
 Officials said the route numbers of buses that will use the BRT corridor are 49 (Adinathnagar to Godhavi), 49/1 (Sarangpur to Jodhpur Gam), 50 (Ghuma to Meghaninagar), 138/1 (Lal Darwaza to Sanand), 151/3 (Iskcon Temple to Hatkeshwar Terminus) and 151 (Iskcon Temple to Vivekanandnagar).
 
 AMTS officials said that the AMC had earlier decided to have these buses use the BRT lane from Nehrunagar, but they later realised that the AMTS buses in the BRT lane was causing congestion inside the corridor, as the Nehrunagar to Shivranjani stretch is very busy. 
 
 They finally withdrew the decision and have now applied it from Shivranjani onwards.
