When Riddhi Sen, all of 19, received the Best Actor award for   from President Ram Nath Kovind, he gave the Bengali contingent a genuine moment of pride. Otherwise, it was a glum atmosphere in Delhi, where about 55 awardees stayed away from the National Awards ceremony. Now the award winners from Bengal, who are back in Kolkata, expect the medals and citations to be sent to them by post, as they were ‘absentees and not protestors’. 
 
  
 Said  , whose Nagarkirtan won big at the 65th National Film Awards, “We were part of a quiet movement. There were no demonstrations; we did not sit outside the auditorium. We felt humiliated and stayed away from the ceremony and all we want is the situation to normalise from the coming year. National Awards are called the President’s Awards and they hold value because they are given away by the head of the state.” Kaushik, who skipped the ceremony, spent the evening at the hotel lobby. He, along with  , maker of   that was adjudged the Best Bengali Film, took the morning flight on Friday and returned to Kolkata.
 Even though there was no further communication from the government’s side after they signed a petition demanding that the awards be given away by the President, Atanu said they should be treated as absentees. 
  
  
 “We had made it clear that we were not boycotting the ceremony, but would remain absent. So, technically, we should be treated as absentees,” he said.  , whose documentary Ladakh Chale Rickshawala was announced as the Best Exploration/Adventure Film in the non-fiction category, too stayed away from the ceremony. “A Films Division official told us that the medals and citations will be sent to us by post, as is the case when an awardee remains absent. The invite clearly states that the awardee cannot appoint anyone else to accept the award on his behalf. And since we were absentees and not protesters, we expect the normal protocol to be followed in this regard,” she said.
