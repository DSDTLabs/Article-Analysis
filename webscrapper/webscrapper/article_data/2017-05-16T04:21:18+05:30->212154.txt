NEW DELHI: As the   grapples with the question on  , a Delhi high court ruling on the issue can serve as a useful template.

 Almost a decade ago the HC described it “an innovation which may have served a purpose at a particular point of time in history but, if rooted out, such a move would not be contrary to any basic tenet of Islam or Quran or against any ruling of  .” However, the ruling by HC had come on a bail plea, limiting the scope of its binding nature.
 
 Justice B D Ahmed, quoting Muslim law concepts relating to  , Quran, Hadis and  , concluded that “triple talaq even for Sunni muslims be regarded as one revocable talaq” allowing the couple “ample opportunity to revoke the same during iddat period.”
 
 HC had said any talaq given in anger was invalid and couldn’t be effective, referring to how the Prophet “deprecated” triple talaq as a sinful one.
 
 Since courts apply Muslim personal law while dealing with divorce cases and have recognised triple talaq to be valid, HC tried to tone down its harshness by making it revocable.
 
 If that is done, HC highlighted, then “family members of the spouses could make efforts at bringing about a reconciliation.
 
 Moreover, even if the iddat period expires and the talaq can no longer be revoked, the couple still has an opportunity to re-enter matrimony by contracting a fresh nikah on fresh terms of mahr etc.” This would remove the need for a “Nikaah halala” that too is being examined by the SC.
 
 HC also linked validity of a triple talaq to attempt at reconciliation, holding that unless there was evidence that the couple tried to re-think, the talaq so pronounced can’t be held to be legal. The case pertains to a a bail plea filed by a husband whose wife accused him of rape.
 
 She alleged he uttered triple talaq thrice but didn’t inform her and by the time she came to know, the couple had continued to live for months.
