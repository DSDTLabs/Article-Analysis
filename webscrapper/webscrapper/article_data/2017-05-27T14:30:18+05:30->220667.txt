Bagalur police station inspector Anjan Kumar told TOI over phone that the police with the help of Bengaluru urban district administration had conducted raid at a brick kiln at Bagalur on Friday and rescued the labourers. “We had received valid input regarding the torture on the labourers.

 A labourer said they were hired by a middleman of the kiln owner seven months ago. The owner had given Rs 18,000 per head to work in the kiln, but later he didn’t pay wage as per the discussion. “We were working around 12 hours per day during last six months. The kiln had no shelter for them,” he added. He said the children were not allowed to go to school. “When one of us wanted holiday to attend last rite of his grandma, the kiln owner didn’t allow him to go. We were living with fear at the worksite,” said the labourer.
