Amritsar: Setting up of a cancer institute and a software technology park in Amritsar as proposed in the Punjab’s 2018-19 budget would promote health tourism and make the city an IT hub as international companies are making a beeline to recruit students from the city’s Indian Institute of Management (IIM), according to experts TOI spoke to. 

 Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal made these announcements during his budget speech in Chandigarh on Saturday. CII-Punjab former chairman Gunbir Singh said the state budget was a stellar effort made despite strained finances, especially setting up of the cancer institute and the IT park in Amritsar. “The endeavour of the state budget was to provide for civic infrastructure, healthcare for citizens and quality education to youth, while keeping in view election promises of assuaging farm debt and to provide power to the industry at Rs 5 per unit. The challenge of surmounting debt is likely to continue its upward spiral, and the biggest challenge shall be raising finances, garnering investment & creating employment,” he said.
 
 Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU) vice-chancellor J S Sandhu said he was satisfied with the Rs 25-crore increase in the grant for the varsity. “GNDU is going to complete 50 years of its existence next year. It is the only ‘category I’ university of the state enjoying full academic autonomy. I have a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation for this benevolent act of the state government,” he said.
