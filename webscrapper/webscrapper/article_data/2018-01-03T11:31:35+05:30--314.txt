MANGALURU: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal and Durga Vahini, the women’s wing of the saffron fringe, which claim that there is an increase in ‘love jihad’ incidents in the coastal districts, will organize a mega awareness campaign against this trend, across Udupi, Kasaragod and   districts from January 3. 

 The saffron outfits claim that Hindu girls who marry Muslim youths are later subjected to harassment, physical abuse and also forced to convert.
 
 MB Puranik, working president, VHP, Karnataka, said that cases of   are increasing by the day in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Kasaragod districts. He alleged that Muslim organizations like the Popular Front of India and some others linked with terrorism are forcefully converting Hindu girls after enacting a love drama. “Once the girls are married, their life is trouble. The organizations are using these victims for terror-related activities. To curb the practice where innocent girls are used by Muslims, we are starting a campaign against it,” he said, pointing out that love jihad is proved to be prevalent in India.
 
 As part of the campaign, they will visit homes, schools and offices in the districts and distribute handbills with literature of awareness on love jihad. They will also hold talks with parents of Hindu girls. They plan to have committees in every village with meetings conducted every month. The campaign will end on January 15.
 
 They have also requested the incident involving a 23-year-old law student to be probed by the NIA. The student became friends on Facebook with Mohammed Iqbal Choudhary from Mumbai, and later eloped and married him.
 
 
 
 
 Activists say the coastal district often witnesses moral policing but only a few cases are reported.
 
 * Muslim girl harassed by boys of her own community for visiting a hanging bridge at Mullarapatna with girls from another community. The minor girl from Ganjimat had arrived in Kukkepadavu to meet her friends (girls) from another community. They later visited the bridge across the Phalguni river. On seeing the girl amid Hindu girls, a group of Muslim boys questioned her and hurled abuses. They assaulted a few boys who tried to defend the girls.
 
 * A group circulated a message on social media to create tension about a girl and boy from two different religions travelling by a private sleeper coach bus. Police, who received the same message through WhatsApp and were tipped off, provided security to the bus through the national highway so that no member of any right wing association could create a nuisance.
 
 * Goons attacked a Muslim boy for travelling with a Hindu girl, seated next to her in a KSRTC Sarige bus in Madikeri KSRTC bus stand. Though the incident occurred at Madikeri, the FIR was lodged at Sullia police station as tension first began in Sullia bus stand. Mohammed Aneef from Gandhinagar in Sullia and a girl from another community boarded a night bus to go to Bengaluru. However, they were unknown to each other. Since the bus was almost packed, the conductor allotted the seats to them. Some saffron fringe groups, who noticed it, raised an objection and started a quarrel. They finally left when the bus staff confronted and pacified them.
 
 * A boy from a minority community was thrashed after he was seen roaming with a girl from another community in a mall. Five persons belonging to a right-wing outfit, and employees of the mall were involved. They approached the couple sitting in the mall and enquired with them about their whereabouts, mainly regarding their religion. As soon as the employees learnt that the duo belonged to different religions, they warned the girl to leave, took the boy behind the mall and beat him black and blue.
 
 * Last September, police arrested a person from a minority community, who allegedly confronted and harassed a group of students outside a mall, near KS Rao Road.
 
 * July 28, 2012: A group of young people had gathered at Morning Mist Home Stay at Padil to celebrate the birthday of a friend. It turned into a nightmare when Hindu Jagaran Vedike activists barged in and attacked them. The goons chased the boys and girls, and even slapped a few of them.
 
 * In 2009, Mangaluru hit national headlines level for the infamous pub attack. A group of 40 activists barged into a pub ‘Amnesia — The Lounge’ and beat up a group of young women and men, claiming the women were violating traditional Indian values. Two of the women were hospitalized. The video of the incident became one of the most watched clips on YouTube.
