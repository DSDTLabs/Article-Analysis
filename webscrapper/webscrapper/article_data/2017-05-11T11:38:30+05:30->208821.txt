HYDERABAD: With the Land Acquisition Bill awaiting the President's nod, the Telangana government is getting ready to take over about 10,000 acres under the Act that it expects to happen anytime soon. Sources said this land is urgently required by the TRS government for construction of barrages, pump houses, bunds and for completion of canal works. The irrigation department has been worried over the past few months as several project works got grounded due to want of land, especially after the Hyderabad High Court struck down the GO 123 which was issued exclusively for land acquisition by the state government. Officials now hope that the land acquisition Act will become a reality in the next few days and enable the state to speedily acquire land as well as provide compensation to the land losers.

 “For completing all the irri gation projects, about 1.5 lakh acres are required. Of this, about 70,000 acres have already been acquired over the years for some projects and about 80,000 acres more needs to be acquired. Once the Act becomes a reality, our first preference would be to acquire the minimal land required for pump houses and barrages. After that, we will focus on the big land requirement for reservoirs and canals,“  , officer on special duty , irrigation department said. Official sources said the   lift irrigation project alone needs about 2,500 acres for construction of three barrages and pump houses at Medigadda, Annaram and Sundilla. Under the same project, 500 acres are required for construction of a barrage on Pranahitha at   in Adilabad district.
 
 For completing another barrage at Tupakulagudem, 400 acres are required and 2,000 acres needed for the Devadula project. The flood flow canal of   project, Yellampally to Mid Manair links and Komarambheem project also require over 5,000 acres for completing them.
