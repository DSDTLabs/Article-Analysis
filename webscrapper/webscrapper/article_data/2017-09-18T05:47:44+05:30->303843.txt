MUMBAI: A day after State Congress president   sacked   committee president Datta Sawant and dissolved all the district and tehsil level committees, controversial party leader and former chief minister   has convened a meeting of his supporters on Monday to decide the next course of action. 

 Apprehending the possibility of Rane joining the   soon, Chavan, on the instructions of the AICC, dissolved the committees and appointed senior leader Vikas Sawant as the new district committee chief.
 
 A senior Congress leader said Rane, along with his sons Nilesh and Nitesh, may join the BJP after the 10-day Navratri festival, which begins on September 21. 
 
 The BJP has offered Rajya Sabha nomination to Rane, minister of state post for Nitesh and legislative council nomination to Nilesh, while Rane is insisting on cabinet post for himself. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis may not accept a proposal for Rane's nomination to the state cabinet.
 
 Rane's contention was that while he was instrumental in the Congress securing victory in the recent Zilla Parishad elections and he retained all organisations in the entire district, he was not consulted before sacking Datta Sawant and dissolving the district and tehsil level committees. "We gained control over all the organisations, including the district central cooperative bank. Despite this, I was not consulted before taking the major decision,'' Rane said.
 
 Rane was unhappy over the style of functioning of Mohan Prakash, AICC general secretary in charge of  , as well as Chavan, saying that ever since he joined the Congress, they were against him. Rane said Chavan has failed to control even his home town Nanded and failed to appoint president for the Ratnagiri district for last four years, but is commenting on organisational matters in Sindhudurg district. "When I joined the Congress a decade ago, I was given specific assurances, but they were never implemented,'' Rane said.
