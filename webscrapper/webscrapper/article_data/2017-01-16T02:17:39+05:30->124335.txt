NAVI MUMBAI: A fake   employment racket was busted and two men were arrested from Sanapada. 

 Assistant police inspector Sachin Hire said, “As of now, 20 victims have approached the police. The victims have been duped of a collective sum of around Rs 10.44 lakh. After cheating several job seekers in  , they shut down their office in October 2016 and shifted to another rental office by another entity, Omanand Human Resources Pvt Ltd, on Sanpada station premises. We have arrested one accused Omkar Talekar (19) on January 10 at 9pm from Sanpada. He led us to his partner Sunny Singh (24), who was arrested on January 13 from Chembur camp at 8.15 pm. Their accomplice, Pagare is untraceable.”
 
 The accused had advertised in newspapers about job vacancies like storekeeper, helper, technican and others in Dubai. 
 
 The three accused, Talekar, Singh and Anand Pagare, had taken fees for visa, medical, air fare and processing fees from several job seekers, most of them hailing from Bihar and UP. Later they shut down their rental offices in October and went missing. 
 
 One of the complainants, Bablu Sharma (27) from Ghansoli said, “In August, I saw an advertisement by Skyway Jobs Pvt Ltd. I approached the agency’s office in Vashi and applied for a helper’s job. Talekar and Pagare assured a job with a salary of Rs 27,000 in UAE. They took 27,000 for visa and processing fees from me. Later, they kept dilly dallying and when I asked for the refund, they gave me a post-dated cheque. However, in October they shut down their Vashi office and were untraceable.”
