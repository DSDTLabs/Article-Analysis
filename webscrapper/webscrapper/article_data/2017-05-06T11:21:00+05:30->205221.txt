CHANDIGARH: The state consumer disputes redressal commission has directed a   to   Rs 3.5 lakh as compensation for causing “mental harassment“ by listing the wrong date of purchase and refusing to extend the vehicle's warranty . 

 The complainant,  , a resident of Sector 33 in Chandigarh, bought a Mercedes-Benz car from   in Sector 8 on October 13, 2015 for Rs 34 lakh, and purchased an insurance policy on the same date. Later, Jain bought an extended warranty from another dealer.
 
 However, the policy said the car was sold on April 30, 2015 and not on October 13, 2015. The extended warranty period was to start at the end of manufacturer warranty period of three years given by Bhagat Automotive when the car was purchased.
 
 The extended warranty was shown as valid up to April 29, 2019, which was six months less than it should be due to the mistake in the date of purchase on the original documents. Jain asked Bhagat Automotive for an explanation but they did not provide it. He then sent an email to the dealer through his counsel on June 4, 2016, pointing out that fraud had been committed due to the change in the date of purchase.
 
  He asked them to replace the car. Bhagat Automotive on June 6, 2016, told him they could not replace the car but would solve the problem. Nothing further was done.
 
 Jain then moved the consumer forum saying that he was sold a second-hand car and the dealer and carmaker had pretended it was new.
 
 Mercedes-Benz told the court that it sold cars to Bhagat Automotive in bulk and the dealer re-sold them. The dealer, therefore, was responsible for retail sale and aftersales service. It said Bhagat Automotive was not an agent of Mercedes.
 
 Bhagat Automotive denied that it sold a second-hand car to Jain. It, however, admitted loss of manufacturer warranty pe riod between April 30, 2015 and October 13, 2015 due to a mistake in the date of purchase.
