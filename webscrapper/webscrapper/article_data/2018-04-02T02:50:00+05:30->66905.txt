Nagpur: Body of an unidentified Maoist was recovered by C-60 commandos on March 30 following an encounter at Humdi forest near Kotmi in Etapalli taluka of Gadchiroli. Two rifles, daily need essentials and Naxalite propaganda literature too have been seized from the place after the fierce gun-battle which is learnt to have lasted around half-an-hour. Police claimed the C-60 jawans had zeroed down upon the Maoist cadres after getting information about their presence. According to a senior official, there was information regarding location of Tippagarh and Kasansoor Dalams near Humdi forest and it’s surrounding hamlets following which the C-60 jawans were sent from Gadchiroli police headquarters. Maoists opened fire after spotting the advancing security forces which triggered retaliation by the C60 jawans leading to the encounter death. Unable to face the C60 retaliation, the rebels fled the scene. During search operations at the encounter site, the jawans recovered the body and other material. Police sources said the dalams were likely to meet to chalk out future strategy as Maoists’s ‘Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign’ (TCOC) is now underway during which sabotage activities by the Naxalites increase usually. “The Maoists are also known to step up activities of their ‘actions teams’ during TCOC targeting tribals by labelling them as police informers or traders / contractors who would not toe their line. This apart, the Maoists remain on the look out for opportunities to attack police during this period,” sources said. SP, Gadchiroli (in-charge), A Raja, said identification of the slain Maoist would lead us to conclude exactly which formation did he belong to. “The surrendered Maoists have been summoned to ascertain identity of the cadre and also our expert team is working on it,” he said.
