NEW DELHI: Three days after an alleged activist of a self-styled religious group was shot dead outside his house in northeast Delhi, police have arrested three men who had an argument with him. Investigations revealed that the accused were a part of a religious group in the area. Police have recovered a country-made pistol and some rounds from them.

 Police said that the three accused, Afzal, Faizal and Azad, were caught from Seelampur after family members of the deceased identified them on the basis of an eyewitness account. “Azad had an argument with the deceased, Ranjit, on September 10 which turned into a scuffle. During this, they had threatened Ranjit with dire consequences. Later, Azad roped in Afzal and Faizal and attacked Ranjit outside his house four days later,” said Pramod Kushwah, DCP, special cell.
 
 Family members had alleged that Ranjit was murdered for his allegiance to the Bajrang Hindu Sewa Dal. Police are yet to establish the cause behind the argument. However, eyewitnesses have told police that Azad, who also claimed to be a part of another religious group, had threatened Ranjit during a religious programme a few days before the argument.
