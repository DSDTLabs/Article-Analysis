PANAJI: Alarmed by the increasing numbers of elderly people housed in Goa’s old age homes, the Provedoria has introduced a new programme with the hopes of sensitising youngsters to the issue. Under the initiative, school and college students will get to spend time with the residents of the 10 Provedoria-owned old age homes across the state, in batches, throughout the year.

 “We will launch the programme — Sneh Bhav Sanskar — in South Goa on February 10 with a workshop for the participating students. The event, to be held at  , will see participation from students of Cuncolim Education Society, Smt Parvatibai Chowgule College, Kare Law College, Damodar High School and Mallikarjun School and College, Canacona,” said Provedoria minister Francis D’Souza.
 
 Around 700 students will then begin visits to the Provedoria homes in South Goa on a daily basis in batches.
 
 “The students will interact with the residents of the homes, tell them stories, listen to their sorrows, sing songs for them. They will also do some basic jobs for the senior citizens,” said Provedoria director Vinayak Volvoikar. He said the programme will serve the dual purpose of providing company to the home residents, as well as sentisitising the next generation to the needs of the elderly so fewer people in future opt to leave their parents in old age homes.
 
  The programme will soon be introduced for students of North Goa, D’Souza said.
 
 He further said that the Provedoria homes also shelter patients who are mentally ill and have not been taken back home by their families even after treatment. He said that Provedoria has already taken in 25 such patients and 70 more are waiting to be accommodated. The increasing number of patients is proving to be a stretch on staff strength and the elderly residents are often left even without anyone to even interact with them.
