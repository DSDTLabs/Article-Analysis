  "Where did all the laughs go? / Are you out there Louis C.K.? / Once crucial conversations / Kept us on our toes / Was it really in our interest / To trample Charlie Rose? / And what's with this 'Me Too'? / This infantilizing term of the day / Is this a toddler's crusade? / Reducing rape, slut-shaming, and suffrage to reckless child's play?"
