WASHINGTON: The United States has congratulated President-elect   on his electoral victory and said that it looks forward to working with him on regional and global issues.

 Kovind, a low-key lawyer-turned-politician, was yesterday elected as India's 14th President, the first BJP member and the second Dalit to occupy the country's highest office.
 
 "We want to congratulate the President-elect Ramnath   on his victory," State Department Spokesperson   told reporters at a news conference yesterday.
 
 Noting that the US and India have a "deep and growing strategic partnership", she said: "We look forward to working with the president-elect on regional and global issues." 
 
 Nauert credited the close people-to-people contact between the world's two largest democracies with the type of partnership they share.
 
 "That partnership is obviously underpinned by our very close people-to-people contact with the Indian government and our shared democratic values," Nauert said in response to a question.
 
 A former Bihar governor, Kovind, 71, received 2930 votes with a value of 7,02,044, to defeat the joint opposition candidate  , a former Lok Sabha speaker, who got 1844 votes with a value of 3,67,314.
 
 Kovind garnered 65.65 per cent of the votes in the electoral college against the BJP's projected 70 per cent vote for him.
