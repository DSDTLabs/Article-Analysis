NASHIK: The word pilgrimage generally reminds one and all of the austere journey and logistical hardships associated with it. But for around 1,500 people who returned from a successful Shirdi-Tirupathi pilgrimage on Sunday, it was like a five-star tour — thanks to the effort by Kopargaon-based NGO   Trust, a brainchild of Nashik’s Nilesh Jape Patil. 

 Jape and his group is conducting Shirdi to Tirumala Pilgrimage for nine on a no-profit-no-loss basis, especially for young spiritualists. 
 
 Known as ‘Palkhi Yatra’, this pilgrimage carries the “paduka” (footprints) of Saibaba to   in a specially hired train. This  , known for its tech-savvy and paperless procedures, has won the   9000:2015 certifications this year. Jape said this was the first time that the ISO certification has been awarded to a religious pilgrimage. 
 
 “ISO 9000:2015 is allotted to organisations seeking sustained success through the implementation of a quality management system. Since the beginning, our focus during this unique Palkhi Yatra has been on the comfort, timeliness, and services to devotees,” Jape told TOI on his return from Tirupati. 
 
 In 2007, this hotelier from Nashik had felt that many people wished to travel to Tirupati but the logistics and language were a problem. He founded the trust the same year and booked 300 tickets for the  , taking devotees to Tirupati. This tour became popular over the years and in 2017, the number of participants reached up to 1,500. Jape’s NGO had to book an entire train for the pilgrimage this year. 
 
 “The preparations start in December every year and we start our journey from January 26. Applications are invited and scrutinized online and 50% preference is given to newcomers. The pilgrims are selected from different strata of society, irrespective of their caste and creed,” Jape added.
