HYDERABAD: In what comes as a startling revelation, latest data from the   (TSPCB) shows that most lakes and tanks in Hyderabad are toxic — swarming with garbage and chemicals. This, despite authorities claiming to have spent crores of rupees in cleaning and beautifying the city’s urban lakes.

 According to PCB’s water quality data for January 2018, Sai Cheruvu, with an alarmingly high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) content of 142 mg/l is one of the most polluted lakes in the city.   classifies water bodies with a BOD content greater than 6 mg/l as polluted.
 
  
  
 
 Other water bodies such as Asani Kunta, with a BOD of 127 mg/l, Pedda Cheruvu (29 mg/ l), Saroornagar Lake (28 mg/l) and   (26 mg/l) were also found to be polluted.
 
  and Sai Cheruvu recorded the highest content of coliform bacteria in water — a sign of untreated sewage flowing into the lake. Similar contamination was found in the Banjara Lake, Langar Houz Lake and  , each of which showed high content of coliform bacteria. Worse is that water samples from all lakes and tanks within GHMC limits showed presence of bacteria.
 
 Experts warn this is extremely dangerous and could result in a Bellandur-like situation, where untreated sewage is let into the lake catchment every day, creating a toxic lake bed leading to fire and foam. Also, high content of toxic chemicals can cause acute dermatitis and other skin conditions. Asani Kunta, for instance, recorded a shockingly high ammonia content of 325 mg/l.
