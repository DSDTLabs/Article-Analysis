NEW DELHI: The   frowned upon the lack of seriousness on the part of governments to address the core issues driving thousands of farmers to suicide and directed the Centre to draw up a comprehensive framework within three weeks to address distress in the farm sector.

 Hearing a PIL by NGO ‘Citizens Resource and Action Initiative’ demanding compensation to families of farmers who had committed suicide, a bench of Chief Justice   and Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice Sanjay K Kaul said, “It is not possible for the court to grant compensation every time a farmer commits suicide.
 
 If the government deals with the reasons only then will suicides stop.” The   said, “When a bank gives loan, it does so being satisfied about the farmer’s capacity to repay it.
 
 If there is a distress situation, banks must take that into account too.”
 
 ASG P S Narasimha said the Centre was keen to improve financial capacity of farmers. “The crop insurance scheme, experts opine, will be the game changer.” However, he said that sociological issues could also drive farmers to commit suicide. Appearing for the petitioner, advocate Colin Gonsalves said governments have been making promises on paper to rescue and rehabilitate farmers.
