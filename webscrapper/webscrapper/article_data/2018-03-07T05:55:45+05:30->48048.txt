PUNE: The civic body will approach experts and leading artists before finalising the new look for Balgandharva Rangmandir. 

 The decision was taken after a group of artists opposed the reconstruction of the iconic auditorium. The standing committee approved Rs 10 crore for its rebuilding, last week.
 
 “The renovation and rebuilding has been planned to mark the golden jubilee the auditorium’s establishment. New facilities will be added and an international level performing platform will be developed with a new auditorium,”  , chairman of the standing committee, said during his budget presentation, last week.
 
 According to the primary plans of the renovation project, the current building will be demolished. Three new auditoriums will come up on the premises. A professional theatre, an experimental theatre and an open air platform will come up.
 
 Artists opposing the renovation claimed that commercialisation should be avoided and the sanctity of the artistic platform maintained.
 
 Corporators sought answers to these concerns. Municipal commissioner   said the issues raised by the artists will be considered. “Their suggestions and objections will be sought before finalising the renovation plan. Their ideas will be included while constructing the new building,” he said.
