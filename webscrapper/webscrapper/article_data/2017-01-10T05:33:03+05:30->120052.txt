MUMBAI: Two days after an 8-year-old boy from Kurla had gone missing, his partly decomposed body was found beneath a pile of gunny bags at a ration shop near his house in   area on Monday morning. 

 The child,  , a student of class 3, was last seen walking into the shop by its owner who asked the boy to leave, said an officer from   police station. "Later, he got busy with work and forgot about the boy, presuming that he had left the shop," said the officer.
 
 The shop was shut on Sunday. On Monday, when the owner opened the shop, a foul smell hung in the air. "He thought it was a dead rat-not unusual for a shop storing foodgrain," said the officer. It's only when neighbours complained of an unbearable stench that he went to check inside. 
 
 "He was shocked to see a child's legs jutting out from beneath the pile of sacks," said the officer. 
 
 A notebook lay beside the boy's body, suggesting that he could have entered the shop to study. "The stack of gunny bags possibly collapsed, crushing the boy," said the officer. 
 
 An accidental death report has been filed at   and the body has been sent for a post-mortem.
