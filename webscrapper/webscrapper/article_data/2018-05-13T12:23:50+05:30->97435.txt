BHOPAL: Heart transplant is the next frontier for state capital’s success story of  . City doctors indicate they are ready to harvest heart from cadaveric donation when the opportunity arises and benefit people in need of heart transplant.

 So far there have been over a dozen cadaveric organ transplants in  , but in none of the cases, cardiac organ could be utilised.
 
 
  
 
 At the heart of the matter is sensitising specialists and first responders, said Siddhanta Red Cross (SRS) super speciality hospital director and gastro-surgeon, Dr Subodh Varshney. The hospital was recently certified to carry out heart transplants.
 
 The next frontier for the doctors is to harvest a heart and transplant in Bhopal. Estimates of the cost of operation are expected to be Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh less than in metros.
 
 “Cardiac transplantation is considered for patients with cardiomyopathy (a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump blood to the rest of the body). There is significant number in a population which can live a better and healthy life after a heart transplant,” said Fortis principal consultant and cardiologist, Dr Vivek Agarwal.
 
 The Gurgaon-based doctor would be part of a team at SRS that would be available for the intervention within hours.
 
 After a person is declared brain dead, the transplant should ideally be conducted within four hours.
 
 However, heart transplant in the long run is unlike liver and kidney transplant. Success rate is about 85% and about 60% cases the new organ last just over 10 years.
 
 “Best care and medication can be provided in Bhopal at a significantly lower cost,” said Bansal hospital director and cardiologist Dr SK Trivedi, whose hospital was one of the first in MP to be certified to carry out cardiac transplant and has an in-house team for the intervention, he added.
