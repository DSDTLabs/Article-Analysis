LUDHIANA: As the   (DBA) elections are being held on April 6, the returning office has ordered   members not to appear in courts on April 5 and 6. The returning officer (RO)   and three additional returning officers (AROs) have also come with the voting schedule for the election.

 The returning officer for DBA elections, in a written order, mentioned: “Due to   on April 6, all DBA members shall not appear in courts on April 5 and 6, being busy in the election process with their respective candidates, and shall abstain from work.” The returning officer (RO) has requested presiding officers of all judicial and executive courts in Ludhiana to cooperate and exempt the presence of DBA members on these days.
 
 “We have already made preparations for the election day, when voting will begin at 9am and end at 4pm. In between, there will be a lunch break from 1.30 to 2pm. There will be separate voting lines for male, female and senior advocates,” said additional returning officer (ARO) Lalita Jain. She added there would be no tolerance to bogus voting, and they would get an FIR registered against the person trying to do so. Jain said voting without identity cards would not be allowed, and added that adequate security measures would be in place to ensure peaceful and smooth voting.
