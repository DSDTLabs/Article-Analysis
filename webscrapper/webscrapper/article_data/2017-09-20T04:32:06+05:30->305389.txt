NEW DELHI: A 14-year-old mentally challenged girl was allegedly thrashed and raped by a rickshawpuller at an abandoned plot in outer Delhi’s   on Monday. Police said that the accused was arrested from the spot. 

 The girl was playing at a park near her house when the accused, her neighbour, came up to her and asked her to accompany him. When she refused, the man slapped and dragged her to his rickshaw, tied her hands and took her to an abandoned plot around 2pm, police said. 
 
 The girl’s maternal uncle spoke to TOI and said that she never used to go out alone and even when she did, she came back home on time. “We assumed that she must have gone somewhere as usual and would return soon. But when she didn’t come back for over an hour, we went out to look for her. Since she was mentally unstable, she did not even have any friends we could check with,” her uncle said.
 
 Around 5pm, one of the relatives noticed the girl crying, her hands tied up. She was sitting on the back seat of the rickshaw and the rickshawpuller looked familiar. The girl’s uncle immediately raised an alarm and alerted the locals. 
 
 When they went close to the rickshaw, they saw blood stains on the seat and nabbed the man who was trying to flee from the spot and thrashed him. One of them made a PCR call, following which a police team reached the spot and arrested the accused.
 
  “A case under sections of rape and POCSO was registered,” said Pankaj Kumar, additional deputy commissioner of police (outer). Police said that the girl’s medical test confirmed rape.
