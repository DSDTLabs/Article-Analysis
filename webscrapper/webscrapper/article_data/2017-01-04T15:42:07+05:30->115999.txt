THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In the months preceding November, to be precise, before the declaration of demonetisation of  , the tourism sector has registered significant growth. Now, there has been a steep fall in tourist arrivals, both foreign and domestic, in the state. 

 "The sector, after the LDF came to power, had recorded 8.93% increase in foreign tourist arrivals while the domestic tourist inflow was increased by 7.89% during July-September period against the corresponding period last year," said tourism minister   while speaking to reporters here on Tuesday. He added that the reverse trend started after the demonetisation, registering 10-15 and 20-30 % decrease in foreign and domestic tourist inflow respectively during the past 55 days.
 
 Though the government is yet to quantify the dip in revenue from the sector, the minister said the spending, especially by foreign tourists who visited the state during this period, had dropped considerably due to cash crunch and limits on currency exchange. "The most affected by this downtrend are the ancillary institutions of the sector and various sections of society dependent on tourism activities to make a living," he said.
 
 The note ban has affected backwater tourism severely, which witnessed more than 40% fall in business. "The state government is helpless as it's up to the Centre to shed its stubbornness and come out with rectifying measures to reverse the trend," he added.
 
 Surendran added that it was a setback for state tourism at a time when the government was trying to give a big boost to the sector through various initiatives including the 'Green Carpet' scheme.
 
 "The projects on the anvil in Malabar region include Thalassery heritage project, ropeway in Dharmadom and international water sports complex in Muzhappilangad," he said. The minister also said that the Akkulam tourism village project would be completed by Onam.
