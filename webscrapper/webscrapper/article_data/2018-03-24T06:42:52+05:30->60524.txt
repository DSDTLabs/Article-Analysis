DIGHA: Speedboat amusement rides at Digha, which were suspended on Thursday following an accident that injured a swimmer, resumed on Friday. But the police gave the nod only after a stern warning to the three operators that they would have to abide by safety norms. 

 "The only instruction we are usually given is to ensure no one ventures out when the sea is rough and rush to rescue if anyone is spotted drowning. But there has never been any order on maintaining a safe corridor for speedboats," alleged a nulia deployed by Digha Sankarpur Development Authority.
 
 Digha police station OC   said monitoring had been stepped up after a tourist suffered deep cuts on his leg when a speedboat grazed past him. "Cops on the beach will ensure no tourist is exposed to any danger either while swimming or otherwise. Our cops will ensure speedboats do not ply in swimming zones. At a meeting on Friday, representatives of the three speedboat operaters at Digha were directed to ensure security for tourists. They were told to ensure no one goes near the point between   and Police Holiday Home where the speedboat rides start and end," Banerjee said. 
 
 "We were told to employ well-trained staff. This was the first accident since the rides began about two years ago," Tushar Nag of Adventure Bay, the speedboat of which was involved.
