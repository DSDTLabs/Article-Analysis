 and   starrer ' ' finally hit theatres on May 26, 
 

 The movie, which drew families to theatres with its pre-release strategy, has nothing new to offer in terms of story or characters. The 2 hour 30 minutes movie starts with a voice over by Nagarjuna introducing Jagapathi Babu and Sampath as best friends and how their relationship suffers when Jagapathi Babu elopes with Sampath's sister.
 
 Fast forward to a couple of years and Siva (Naga Chaitanya), son of Jagapathi Babu, goes to a cousin's wedding and falls in love with the only girl child - Brahmaramba (Rakul Preet) - of a family headed by Aadi (Sampath).
 
 The plot is mundane and might be annoying for many just after a few minutes into the film. Compositions of scenes and editing are very predictable and may not interest an intelligent viewer.
 
 Naga Chaitanya has tried a family genre for the first time and seems to have delivered a convincing performance keeping aside a few goof-ups here and there.
 
 Director Kalyan Krishna Kurasala has tried to portray old wine in new bottle in terms of the movie’s plot and it abruptly goes into intermission when Brahmaramba gets upset with Siva for a very trivial reason.
 
 The comedy sequences add nothing to the narration and seem out of place. Actors Posani Krishna Murali, Raghu Babu, Prudhvi, Sapthagiri, Tagubothu Ramesh, Sudharshan and   all are roped in for the same and effortlessly does probably what have been asked by the director to do.
 
 Music by   is average but it’s the background score that stands out.
 
 In a nutshell, the movie doesn't get you excited for a bit and passes off as a regular run-of-the-mill offering.
