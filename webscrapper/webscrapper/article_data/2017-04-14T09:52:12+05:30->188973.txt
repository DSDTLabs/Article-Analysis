PATNA: A PIL was filed in Patna high court on Thursday seeking action against RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s third daughter   for showing her residential address as Bihar CM’s official residence – 1, Aney Marg – in the registration documents of Delight Marketing Co. Pvt. Ltd. in the capacity of director of the firm.

 The PIL was filed by Patna HC lawyer  , who had earlier filed another PIL last week seeking fair probe into the alleged soil purchase scam at Patna zoo. The documents furnished by Sengar mention that Chanda had shown her address as “CM House, 1 Aney Marg, Sachivalaya Thana, GPO, Patna, Patna-800001” at the time of her appointment as director in the company on September 29, 2014.
 
 Apart from Chanda, several other members of Lalu family, including his wife Rabri Devi and minister sons Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and   have also been made respondents in the PIL as they were directors in the firm when the registration documents were filed with the Registrar of Companies. 
 
 Based on the registration documents related to Delight Marketing Co. Private Limited, Sengar has stated in his PIL that commercial use of government residential buildings entitled to people holding constitutional posts like the governor and CM is ultra vires to the constitution and punishable as per law.
 
 “I have stated in my PIL that even though former CM Rabri Devi (Chanda’s mother) vacated the office of the CM in 2005, Chanda mentioned 1, Aney Marg as her residential address in 2014. This is completely unauthorised and also indicates lack of security as the offender used the CM’s residential address as her own for personal gains and no objection was made against it,” Sengar told TOI.
 
 Sengar has further stated in his plea that appropriate directions be issued to the respondents, including Bihar chief secretary and principal secretary of home department, to inquire into the matter.
