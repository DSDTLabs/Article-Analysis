While the Malayalam big screen is waiting to watch   after a break through the upcoming Prithviraj film 'Ranam' aka 'Detroit Crossing,' she is also venturing into yet another platform - TV. Isha, who debuted in the industry in 2012, will be seen in a cameo on the popular Malayalam serial ' ' directed by Sunil Karyattukara. 

 Apparently, her part adds an ounce of shock value to the audience of the serial, which has 'Minnaminungu - the Firefly' fame Rabecca Santhosh playing the protagonist. Isha hints that her character comes for the wedding of Jeeva, a prominent character in the serial played by Sreeram ramachandran, who was also part of Thattathin Marayathu, Isha's first movie. "Not too many people know this, but I have been a child artiste and I have worked in the TV industry before. Shooting for Kasthooriman brought back a lot of memories from those days, as it is very different from films. TV has crazy timelines and deadlines and we are running around trying to shoot as much as you can in a day. I waiting to see what the response is like," she says.
 
 The episode featuring Isha is expected to be aired in a few days. If sources are to be believed, Aju Varghese is also expected to make a cameo in the serial, soon.
