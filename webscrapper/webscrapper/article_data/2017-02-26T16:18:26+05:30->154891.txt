Let's face it, performing rap is not everyone's cup of tea. But when it comes to   music, the past few years has seen immense experimentation. And one can proudly say that Marathi   now has a very genuine rap addition -  , one that shows lots of skill and finesse in the way it has been recorded, shot and got together.

  (aka The King Jd), Jasraj Jayant Joshi, including other members from the team have gifted the city a well-written, well-composed and well-performed video that has been shot and edited very well. A true tribute to Pune's youthful vibe, the lyrics of the song have been penned by Vaibhav Joshi. & the rest of their team have truly gifted us with a genuinely well written, composed, sung & video graphed song. The track that features Shreyash, captures the true Puneri X factor in the song.
 
 The director of this video, Sujit Kumar, also doubled up as the choreographer for the piece. This song video in tow, we can hardly wait for more such tributes to the city.
