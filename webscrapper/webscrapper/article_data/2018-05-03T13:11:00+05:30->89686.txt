PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday directed the directorate of social welfare to release the salaries within two days to two staffers of the office of the commissioner for persons with disabilities.

 The high court has adjourned the case to Friday. The staff filed a petition before the court over their salaries that have not been paid for one year.
 
 A junior stenographer and driver, who joined the office of the commissioner for persons with disabilities in March 2017, sought directions to the respondents- the directorate of social welfare and the directorate of accounts to release their   which has been pending since they joined.
 
 In their petition, they have sought a direction to set aside the corrigendum issued by the directorate of social welfare in April last year that granted pay scales to them according to the 6th pay commission instead of the 7th pay commission for direct recruitment.
 
 The petitioners have termed the corrigendum “illegal” and “arbitrary” and contrary to the advertisement of the post. The petitioners have also pointed out that they were allotted work not in conformity with the post advertised.
 
 The petitioners have stated that they have families to look after and that they have given up opportunities to work in other avenues and applied for the posts duly advertised as it was a permanent post.
 
 The directorate of social welfare advertised for the post of junior stenographer, driver and peon in May 2016. The petitioners applied for the posts and were selected. The state’s first full-time commissioner for persons with disabilities   tendered her resignation last month over the lack of basic facilities provided to make the office of the commissioner for persons with disabilities functional.
