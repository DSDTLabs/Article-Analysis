MADURAIi: Police have taken off the protection for   in Alanganallur, Palamedu and Avaniayapuram as the ban on jallikattu was lifted by an ordinance brought by the state government. Police removed the barricades and police deployment almost after two weeks amid loud cheer and celebration by the thousands of people gathered there. People at Alanganallur rushed to the vadivaasal and cheered to express their happiness. 

 Locals said they had indeed expected the government to heed their demands. However, they would not rejoice fully before they were convinced that the event could be conducted in the future without any hindrance. 
 
 In fact when a posse of policemen waded through the thousands of protesters and approached the vadivaasal at Alanganallur, they were initially circumspect. They calmed down only on realising that they had trooped in only to remove the barricades. A loud thunder of cheers from the crowd erupted to show their happiness in a chorus. They whistled and raised slogans praising their unity which had led the government to give in to their demand. 
 
 "We thank the local administration for not having met our initial demand of letting only five bulls through vadivaasal. Now that they have handed over the entire vaadivaasal to us and left. This is our success. We would not have got this result had the local authorities agreed to our demand then, which looks trivial now, and let the bulls to run through," Dinesh Kumar, a protester camping in Alanganallur from day one said. 
 
 "We are not in a mood to call off the protest until we are convinced that the present actions of the state government are enough to conduct jallikattu in future," said S  , a villager. 
 
 Madurai district superintendent of police   said police had cleared all barricades and police deployment had also been removed from both Alanganallur and Palamedu vadivaasal.
