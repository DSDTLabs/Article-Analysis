PANAJI: The state forest department has recieved the green signal from the   (CZA) to procure a new pair of tigers for the state’s only zoo in Bondla wildlife sanctuary. Goa forest officials are in talks with Dr Shivaram Karnath Biological Park, Mangaluru for the same.
 
 “We have already proposed this to the   (CZA) and they have given us a green signal to procure a new pair for the zoo. It may take a few months but we will try to get them this year itself. The matter has to now be discussed with the state advisory board following which we can initiate an exchange,” a forest official told TOI.
 
 Bondla zoo lost their former pair of tigers Rana and Sandhya recently.
 
 The former pair, tiger Rana and his tigress Sandhya were among the first animals to be brought to the zoo. They were brought in from   Zoological Park, Vishakhapatnam in 2009. Following the demise of Rana in December, the zoo was on the lookout for a mate for Sandhya. However, last month, Sandhya, too, breathed her last. Forest officials have attributed the death of both the animals to “natural cause” since either had reached old age.
 
 Now with the fresh proposal sent to the CZA to bring in a fresh pair tigers to the zoo, the animals are likely to be brought in exchange for a pair of Indian bisons (gaurs). 
 
 Since rules state that animals can only be exchanged among zoos, the department is contemplating the exchange of gaurs housed at the zoo. The zoo currently houses six gaurs, two females and four males.
