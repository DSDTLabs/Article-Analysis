CHANDIGARH: Amidst protests from the   (CLP) leader Kiran Choudhry and Hisar MP Dushyant Chautala of INLD, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday laid the foundation stone of the Rs 500-crore medical college in Bhiwani and announced Rs 10 crore each for Bhiwani rural and urban assembly constituencies. 

 Though the Mahendergarh MLA and education minister   failed to make it to the venue due to his assignments for   president  's visit to Haryana, local party leaders and Bhiwani (Urban) MLA Ghanshyam Sharaf and Bhiwani (rural) MLA Bishambar Balmiki were the two legislators who accompanied the CM. Khattar reiterated his government's commitment of uniform development of Haryana. However, Chautala junior and CLP leader Choudhry alleged biased approach of the CM in developing the state.
 
 Dushyant alleged that despite the fact the projects, whose foundation stones were laid, were part of his Lok Sabha consitutency, he was not intimated in advance. Sources informed that sensing trouble in future, the district administration officials had invited him telephonically. On the other hand, CLP leader Choudhary blamed Khattar of biased attitude as the BJP government had changed the name of the proposed medical college. "This medical college was announced in 2013-14 and it should have been completed by now. It was named after Bansi Lal, the creator of modern Haryana, but the government has renamed it for the reasons best known to it. Anyhow, people of Haryana are waiting for the elections now," she stated in a release issued on Saturday.
 
 According to information, Khattar, who was accompanied by Union health minister J P Nadda, addressed a rally in   area of Bhiwani. He also announced the health department's plans of starting the survey for health insurance from August. While apprising Nadda and those present on the occasion, Khattar also elaborated on the increase in the budget allocation for the state health department.
