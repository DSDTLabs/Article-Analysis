KOLKATA: The Rs 13,000-crore   in   is looking to push its   up by Rs 2,000 crore more in the next two years. The ambitious target, set after the   Amit Mitra assured all help to the sector, will generate at least1 lakh additional jobs.

 “The leather industry in the state provides employment to 3 lakh people. They have set a target of providing jobs to 1 lakh more people in next two years.But I would urge them to double their target. They will get all support from the government,“ said Mitra. He was present at the inauguration of India International Leather Fair and TexStyles India 2017. “I would urge them to push their turnover to Rs 15,000 crore and exports to Rs 10,000 crore,“ he said.
 
 The leather industry in the state, mainly concentrated in the Bantala region, had a turnover of Rs 13,000 crore in 2015-16.“Creation of 1 lakh jobs would require an additional turnover of Rs 2,000 crore. This is achievable as many units are ready to start operations. Forty units are waiting for environmental clea rance,“ said Ramesh Juneja, regional chairman (east) of the Council for Leather Exports.
 
 Spread over 1,100 acres, Bantala Leather Complex houses more than 25 leather units and 375 tanners. “Last year, we declared Bantala as a township.An act has also been passed to that effect. After that, development works picked up pace here,“ said Mitra. The state has earmarked an investment of Rs 50 crore to create infrastructure facilities at Bantala.
 
 The tanneries here have been facing trouble with the effluent treatment plants for long.While a 20mn litre effluent treatment plant was in operation, two new common effluent treatment plants -each with a capacity of 5mn litre -are being set up.
