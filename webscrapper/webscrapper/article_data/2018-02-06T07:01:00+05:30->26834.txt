Noida: The National Human Rights Commission on Monday took suo motu cognizance of media reports about the shooting of a gym trainer in Noida by a trainee sub-inspector on Saturday. The commission sought a detailed report on the shooting from the chief secretary and the director general of police,  , within six weeks. It also directed them to sensitise police personnel against abusing their power to harass innocent citizens. 

 The gym trainer, Jitendra Yadav, was with his two friends in a Scorpio when a trainee sub-inspector, Vijay Darshan, shot him after scuffle in Parthala village in Noida on Saturday night.
 
 In a notice to the chief secretary and the DGP, the commission observed that creating an atmosphere of fear is not the correct way to deal with crime. Referring to the gym trainer, Jitendra Yadav (25), the commission also observed that he was travelling with his friends when the “rowdy act done by the delinquent sub inspector gravely violated his right to life and liberty.”
 
 “It seems the police personnel in Uttar Pradesh are feeling free, and are misusing their power in the light of an undeclared endorsement given by the higher ups,” the commission said. “They are using their privileges to settle scores with people. The police force is to protect the people, and these kinds of incidents will send a wrong message to the society,” it said.
