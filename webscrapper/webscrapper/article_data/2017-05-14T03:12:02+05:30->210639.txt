The special investigation team (SIT), hand-picked by CP K   to   and to rein in mafia, would soon take services of an expert in land and revenue records. 

 The expert would provide guidance on verifying documents, extracting revenue records, and provide assistance in scrutinizing papers. 
 
 The CP also aims to increase the strength of SIT which is now headed by   who has been also named as new ACP crime in place of Nilesh Raut. 
 
 The development comes after the chaos in verifying documents in a matter where real estate dealer-cum-film distributor Appu Wadhwani, Dilip Gwalbanshi and others were made accused in a case at Sadar police station following a complaint from a so-called victim Piyush Mishra. 
 
 The CP said, “We are informally in the process of roping in a retired personnel from revenue or land record department. Apart from land grabbing cases, we are also trying to include complaints of extortions, threatening and other property-related crimes. Citizens can file complaints with the SIT or ACP crime.”
 
 Venkatesh also said that multi-agency approach is already being taken by involving NIT, NMC, collector office and forest departments. “Detection of frauds in Tavakkal layout and registration of offences are an outcome of joint efforts,” he said and indicated several such issues would be discussed in a meeting with other departments soon.
