HYDERABAD: As many as 31 flights to Hyderabad — 21 domestic and 10 international — were diverted to Chennai, Bengaluru and Nagpur late on Wednesday night following the closure of   runway after the Indigo aircraft’s tyres burst on landing.

 The maximum diversions were to Bengaluru with 20 flights being re-routed to its Kempegowda International Airport. Dozens of flights to and from Hyderabad were delayed by three to seven hours.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 At least 14 domestic flights to Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Bhubaneshwar, Kochi and other cities were cancelled on Thursday. Two flights to Hyderabad from Delhi were also cancelled, airport officials said. “It was scary. I was travelling alone for the first time. My relatives who had come to receive me at Hyderabad airport had to wait without any idea when I would reach the city,” said a 14-yearold passenger whose flight from Ranchi was diverted to Bengaluru a little after 11pm. The flight scheduled to land in Hyderabad at 11.15pm on Wednesday reached the city at 7.15am on Thursday.
 
 Giving vent to their frustration, many passengers on social media detailed their prolonged wait at the airports, with little or no information about their flights. Hundreds of passengers were stranded overnight at the RGI airport.
 
 An Indigo flight from Goa to Hyderabad was delayed by nearly four hours. At Delhi’s   airport too, there were delays, apart from five cancellations. “Not many flights arrived from Hyderabad during this period. Operations returned to normal in the evening,” said a source.
 
  reported the cancellation of a Bengaluru bound flight, scheduled to depart at 8am on Thursday with around 70 passengers on board.
