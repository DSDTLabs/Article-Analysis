BENGALURU: Recent camera-trap images recovered by the forest department from Hanur range, about 165km from Bengaluru, off   district, have exposed the poaching menace in the region. 

 The images show   armed with country-made guns with the body of a deer. Department officials, after conducting an investigation based on clues from the images, arrested two villagers and recovered a gun from them.
 
 H H  , assistant conservator of forests (ACF),   Wildlife Sanctuary, under which Hanur range falls, said hunt is on for two other miscreants who have escaped. “The arrested are Janu of Marimangala and Venkatesh of Shagya village; we have also recovered a gun from the duo. Now we are on the lookout for Raju of Marimangala and Ranga of Shagya,” he added.
 
 Ankaraju said they had placed CCTV cameras at select points in the forest to keep tabs on movement of wild animals. “It’s good that these cameras are helping us with clues about illegal activities in the wild. We will install more in the coming months,” he added.
 
 B C Lokesh, range forest officer, Hanur range, said the arrested have confessed to the crime. P Ramesh Kumar, deputy conservator of forests, Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, led the operation.
 
 Wildlife activists say poaching at Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary is on the rise; four cases have been registered in the last six months. “There could be many cases which have gone unnoticed or haven’t been registered. The most common victims are deer and miscreants use snare traps, guns, poison, etc. to hunt them down,” said a wildlife activist.
 
 The sanctuary, spread over Mandya, Chamarajanagar and Ramanagara districts, is home to the Malabar giant squirrel and grizzled giant squirrel, which are listed under the highly endangered category. Apart from tigers and elephants, the sanctuary is home to over 250 birds and many reptile species.
