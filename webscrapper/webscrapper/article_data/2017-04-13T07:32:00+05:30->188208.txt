 Chandigarh: The   Employees Union on Wednesday made a complaint to the UT adviser regarding advertising of 10 non-teaching posts by   University of Technology without taking prior permission from the UT administration.
 
 In their complaint to UT adviser Parimal Rai, the association stated that the PEC authorities had uploaded the information for recruiting contractual employees to non-academic positions for a period initially up to one year on its official website without the Chandigarh administrationâ€™s approval.
 
 The union members have alleged that the PEC authorities wanted to engage select candidates on the advertised posts and that is why they had not taken approval for the higher authorities. They have also demanded that the UT administration should instruct the PEC authority to stop the recruitment and an inquiry be ordered in the case. 
 
 The PEC authorities have called in applications for the post of security officer, deputy registrar, assistant librarian, public relations officer, officer on special duty and sports officer, two executive officers and assistant registrar. 
 
 A PEC official said that in a recent Board of Governor (BOG) meeting, approval was given to the university authorities to hire staff on the posts lying vacant since long. The authorities had informed the BOG that there were 10 posts that had to be filled immediately as the working of the institute was being affected. 
 
 There are around 399 sanctioned posts out of which 150 are lying vacant. The BOG had given nod to fill 22 of these posts and the PEC authorities have sent the proposal to the UT administration for approval of the advertised posts. The response from the administration is awaited, the official said, adding that three months ago the applications were called in to fill these posts but there was no response.
