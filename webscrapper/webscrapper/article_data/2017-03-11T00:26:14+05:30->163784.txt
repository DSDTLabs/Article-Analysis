NAVI MUMBAI: Some of the CCTVs installed in Uran have not been working since several weeks, said sources from   CCTV section.

 “Two CCTVs installed in the Charphata area stopped working long ago and some others stopped functioning some time back. Few CCTVs have been installed by Cidco,” said in-charge of Uran police CCTV section.
 
 Sources added that the CCTV upkeep is being neglected as the contractors have not been paid. “The contractors are ignoring the  ,” alleged a source.
 
 The Uran Municipal Council has installed CCTVs at Ambedkar garden, Mora garden and Gandhi park, said Mahesh Lote, an Uran Municipal Council store department staffer. 
 
 “All CCTVs are connected to the police station. We will visit the police station to find out the status. A contractor is looking after the maintenance,” he added. He also said that they were informed by the cops whenever CCTVs stop working. “But we have not got any such message,” he added.
