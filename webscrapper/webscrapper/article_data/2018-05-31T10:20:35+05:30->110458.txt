LUCKNOW: Counting of votes for   and Noorpur by-elections began on Thursday amid reports of the   candidates taking a lead against the BJP on both seats. 

 
 According to initial reports, SP backed RLD candidate   was leading by a margin of over 3,000 votes against BJP's  . Mriganka is the daughter of BJP MP   whose death necessitated a bypoll in the Muslim and Dalit dominated seat. 
 
 The joint opposition was also ahead in Noorpur where RLD backed SP candidate Naimul Hasan was leading by a margin of over 4,000 votes against BJP candidate Avani Singh, wife of BJP MLA Lokendra Singh whose death in a car crash necessitated a byelections in the seat. Lokendra had won the seat in 2012 as well as 2017 UP assembly elections. 
 
 The lead attained by the joint opposition on both the seats came a initial set back to the BJP which had pushed its organisational machinery to consolidate the voters. The party had also been relying on a sympathy factors to counter the joint opposition candidates. Besides CM  , the ruling BJP had also deployed at least half a dozen cabinet ministers to campaign in the region. This was apart an indirect campaign by PM Narendra Modi who reached neighbouring Baghpat a day before polling. 
 
 The opposition has however been taking up the issues of pending care arrears, recent Dalit unrest and a controversy over installation of Jinnah portrait in AMU. 
 
 The initial trend in Kairana and Noorpur, political experts said, was bound to dampen the morale of the BJP after its humiliating defeat in Gorakhpur and Phulpur byelections in March earlier this year. Then, the BSP and SP had come together to defeat the BJP. Though the BSP had not contested the byelections, it lend an indirect support to the opposition. 
 
 The byelections in the two high stake seats are also seen as a mandate on BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha elections due next year.
