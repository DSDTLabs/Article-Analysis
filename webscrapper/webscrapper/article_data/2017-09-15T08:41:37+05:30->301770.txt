Come January, Mumbaikars and visitors to the commercial capital of the country can plan a lunch or dinner aboard a floating restaurant on the sea off the Gateway of India or  . Shipping ministry sources said the private player who had won the bid to run floating restaurants at the two spots had now informed them that the ships to be used for the purpose would arrive soon.

 The Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) had invited tenders for three floating restaurants at three locations, the Gateway of India, Nariman Point and Girgaum Chowpatty , of which two bids had been awarded for 15 years. The floating restaurants will be around three kilometres out in the sea and customers will have to take a water boat to reach these. The MbPT has given permission for round-the-clock operation of the restau rants and even the rights to operate a cruise.
 
 TOI has learnt that the MbPT is likely to take a decision on how to facilitate the transport of customers from the shore to the floating restaurants on Friday . Soon after taking charge of the shipping ministry in 2014,   had said he intended to bring the country's first floating restaurants to Mumbai. He had even talked about marriage and birthday parties on the sea.
 
 Shripriya Dalmiya Thirani, who has got the contracts for the two restaurants, said one ship was coming from the Mediterranean and another from the Far East. “Besides restaurants, we will offer option for marriage and other functions,“ she said.
 
 Thirani said the restaurants would have music and lights. “It will be a great escape for people to spend time where they have good view and fresh air,“ she said.
 
 Port officials said the ships with multiple restaurants would have to have a minimum capacity of 125 seats. They said the ships would be equipped with state-of-theart equipment for navigation, safety and pollution prevention. Thirani said people would not be allowed to stay overnight and there was no permission to run a casino.
