New Delhi:   has been designed as a sustainable capital of Andhra Pradesh and is set to become the first urban area which will get most of the construction material through   to build the 21.23 sq km state capital.

 Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has already started dredging on the 80-km stretch between Muktyala to Vijayawada on Krishna river. Muktyala has a major cement plant and is also known as the hub for construction material.
 
 “The waterway will be enough to transport cement and other construction material for the new capital city. The project includes construction of three permanent terminals. To facilitate movement of passengers and cargo, we will have four floating jetties,” said an IWAI official.
 
 In order to implement the project, the authority has moved the proposal for a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in which the Andhra Pradesh government will be a partner. 
 
 Besides residential and government buildings, Amaravati will have 12 institutions spread over 995 acres and will see Rs 17,808 crore investment. There will be educational institutions, health centres and Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams besides other government establishments. By 2050, the city expects to have a population of 3.5 million.
 
 Some of the other features of the city include 100% recycling of solid and liquid waste, vacuum system for high density areas and using technology to minimise need for land fill areas.
 
 IWAI officials said the cost of transport will depend on the total quantity of cargo to be shipped through the waterway, but it is going to be much less than the cost involved in transportation of construction material by road or rail.
 
 “Moreover, moving cargo through waterway will avoid congestion and pollution within and around the city. The waterway project has been designed to ensure a cleaner mode of transport of goods. The waterway will be expanded further,” said a shipping ministry official.
