AHMEDABAD:   leader Alpesh Thakor, who, along with PAAS and dalit leaders had been threatening to disrupt the   over various issues, has called off plans to create trouble for the government. 

 After a meeting with MoS home, Pradipsinh Jadeja and principal chief secretary to the CM, K Kailashnathan, Thakor, on Sunday , said, “We will not disrupt the VGGS as it may harm Gujarat's Asmita or pride, and as we have faith in the government."
 
 Surprisingly , the other community leaders who had been backing Thakor's threat to disrupt the VGGS seemed to have been kept in the dark about the meeting. Thakor had declared on January 6 that he will disrupt the VGGS-2017. Thakor said that at the meeting, Jadeja and Kailashnathan had assured him that 85% of jobs in the state will go to Gujaratis and the state will see “thousands of jobs in the next few months.“ Jadeja told ToI, “I told Thakor that Gujarat government has been implementing a policy to give 85% jobs to Gujaratis since 1995. We will keep implementing this for jobs generated from VGGS-2017 investments."
