CHARMINARr: Pathetic condition of   Kunta Road is causing motorists inconvenience. 

 Apart from gigantic potholes, the street -- one of the busiest in the area -- also has garbage strewn all over the place, complain commuters. 
 
 "The road is in a deplorable state. It is tough to cross the stretch on a daily basis. Half the road is battered. Authorities must come and visit the road to understand our grievances. Maybe then they will make some effort to repair it,'' said a resident, Shaik Jilani.
 
 Locals complained that motorists travelling towards   and Asif Nagar are particularly affected, especially during late hours. 
 
 "In one incident, a biker riding on this stretch during the night suddenly lost control and fell. He escaped with minor injuries to his elbows. But that might not be the case always. Unless motorists drive with caution they can be susceptible to such accidents on this stretch," said Mohd Anwar, a regular on this road.
 
 Reiterating locals' concerns, a shopkeeper operating along the road pointed out how it formed an important link between residential localities such as Zeeba Bagh, Syed Ali Guda, Mehdipatnam and Asif Nagar.
 
 "I sincerely appeal the authorities to take stock of the situation. They should not just repair the road, but also clean it up so that people don't suffer in such unhygienic conditions,'' the trader said.
