MUMBAI: Airlines have got into a battle over on-time performance data, with SpiceJet and   expected to fire the first salvo this week.

 Officials of both these airlines plan to meet the director-general of civil aviation on Tuesday to question the merit in IndiGo's recent complaint about the veracity of on-time performance (OTP) data collected by the Mumbai airport. On-time performance is a measure of an airline's ability to operate its flight schedule with punctuality. Airports monitor the arrival and departure time of each and every airline flight to deduce the OTP of each carrier and send a monthly data to the aviation regulator.
 
 No airlines had questioned the veracity of the data sent by airports till last month when IndiGo accused   (MIAL) of monitoring OTP in a way that shows some “competing airlines“ as more punctual than they may be in reality . TOI had reported the issue on December 28, following which the the DGCA chief B S Bhullar had formed a panel to investigate IndiGo's allegations. Last week, the panel found some discrepancies in the computation of OTP data, following which the DGCA constituted a committee to look into the matter and a publish fresh OTP data from March or April.
 
 The DGCA move has not gone down well with other airlines, especially those that had registered better OTP .For one, Spice   have questioned IndiGo's intentions behind filing these complaints.
 
 “As long as IndiGo had the best OTP, the mechanism to calculate on-time performance by the DGCA and airports was perfect. Now, for many months when their OTP has been the poorest, they are questioning it,“ said an airline official.
 
 “Other airlines are worried with the aviation regulator succumbing to IndiGo's unjustified demands. Senior SpiceJet and Jet Airways officials will meet the DGCA chief on Tuesday to voice their concerns,“ he added.OTP data for December, submitted by the Mumbai airport to the DGCA, puts IndiGo along with   on the bottom rung as far as departures are concerned. The data showed that 50% of departures operated by IndiGo and AI out of Mumbai airport were delayed.
