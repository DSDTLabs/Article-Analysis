MOHALI: Relatives of a victim of a road accident caused due to stray animal have sought a compensation of Rs 99 lakh from the authorities, holding the civic body responsible for his death as it failed to control the menace.  , a labourer, was killed after his motorcycle hit a stray animal in Phase VII on April 17.

 
 Advocate   said victim’s wife Suman, who has three daughters and a son, has sent a legal notice to Punjab local bodies department secretary, municipal commissioner, mayor, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority chief administrator and SSP. In her notice, she said when she and her husband reached near Chawla Hospital, a stray animal suddenly came in front of them, leading to the accident.
 
 
 
 Rajinder was taken to civil hospital, Phase VI, where he succumbed to his injuries.
 
 MC joint commissioner Avneet Kaur said, “We have received the notice and it has been forwarded to our legal cell. An appropriate reply will be filed by the department.”
 
 Kaur said the MC has no policy to pay compensation to people who died due to stray cattle or stray dog menace. Recently Rs 1,500 was sanctioned only for treatment of stray dogs bite victims.
 
 She said, “We are yet to constitute bye-laws to compensate stray cattle death victims. The bye-laws can only be constituted once the agenda is taken up in the MC house meet and gets approved by the local bodies department. Till date, there is no exercise to constitute such bye-laws.”
