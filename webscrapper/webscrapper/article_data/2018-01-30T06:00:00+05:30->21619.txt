KOLKATA: With just a day to go for the International Kolkata  , the authorities are ready with a slew of measures to make the fair experience as trouble-free as possible for the visitors. While the cops have foolproof security plans ready, the   has lined up all civic facilities in and around Central Park, the fair ground.

 Both — the cops and the civic body — have launched apps specially designed for the book fair. 
 
 The apps will have all information on the fair. Since footfall is expected to soar, policemen have been roped in from neighbouring districts. There will be extra deployment at City Centre-I, Banabitan and   in case some book lovers choose to visit these hotspots. 
 
 “We will be frisking visitors according to our discretion. Unlike the FiFA event, there are only a few items which you cannot carry inside. We have set up eight watch towers,” said Amit Jawalgi, DC (headquarters).
 
 Elaborate arrangements have been made to keep the traffic moving in the area. No-entry zones, parking zones, signage...the cops have zeroed in on the best possible combination after trying and testing a series of possible options.
