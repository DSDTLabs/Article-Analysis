Trichy: High patronage, especially from morning walkers and youth, for the kilometre-long walking track along the Uyyakondan canal on Anna Nagar link road has got the wheels in motion for the city corporation to consider replicating a similar facility on the opposite bank of the same stretch of the canal.  However, with the public works department (PWD) controlling the banks of the canal, corporation sources said that a similar facility would be possible only if PWD approves the proposal to utilise the available land. As a part of cleaning initiative taken by the citizens under the banner ‘Citizen for Uyyakondan’, public along with corporation workers have been engaging in cleanliness drive on weekends along the banks of 1,000-years-old Uyyakondan canal.  On Sunday, the corporation and public cleared the bushes on a portion of the banks close to Thennur Uzhavar Sandhai grounds.  The unutilised portion of Uyyakondan banks, the stretch branching off from MGR roundabout till Uzhavar Sandhai grounds, was cleaned by the Citizen for Uyyakondan volunteers on Sunday.  “A walking track along the other bank close to Uzhavar Sandhai grounds can be established if PWD approves the proposal. We have such proposals to beautify the city,” corporation commissioner N Ravichandran told TOI.  Expanding the walking and cycle tracks along the Uyyakondan canal on Anna Nagar link road has been welcomed by the public. PWD sources said that they have to study the proposal once it is submitted by the corporation. In a preliminary move to prevent pollution in the canal, sign boards conveying the history and benefits of the irrigation canal have already been erected along the banks to fan behavioural change among the public to prevent pollution in the fresh water body.
