ISLAMABAD: Perturbed over the US's decision to put   on the Financial Action Task Force ( )   watch list, home minister   on Monday called it an attempt to destabilise the country's economy.

 
 "It is a 'politically motivated' move to undermine Pakistan's economic progress," the minister said, warning the global community that putting Pakistan on the watch list of countries funding terrorism would be counter-productive and hamper joint efforts to curb terrorism. "The move would hurt Pakistan's capability to fight terrorism," he said.
 
 Iqbal's statement comes as a week-long plenary session of the global anti-money-laundering watchdog was reviewing proposals calling for Pakistan to be included on a list of countries which have failed to prevent terror financing. "We bore the burden of the war on our own...," the minister said.
 
 The FATF resolution, if adopted, would place Pakistan on the watchdog's grey list of "jurisdictions with deficient anti-money laundering regimes". According to official sources,   has sought assistance from China and Saudi Arabia to convince the US to soften its aggressive approach towards Pakistan.
