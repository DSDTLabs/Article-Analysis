You must have heard this often – have a light dinner to lose weight. But how to make dinner light? Well, by eating something wholesome in the evening. This is the make or break meal, it decides whether you will have long-lasting fitness or whether it will fizzle out in the next couple of weeks. This is the Week 4 guideline of Rujuta Diwekar’s Fitness Project — eat a wholesome meal between 4 and 6 pm. 

  Why? Our hormone cortisol follows a natural cycle; it rises in the morning, allowing you to start fresh, clear bowels, and drops in the evening, to allow for restful sleep in the night. When we don’t eat anything in the evening or kill our appetite with chai or coffee, our body works at producing more cortisol instead of reducing it. This leads to: overeating at dinner; poor sleep; slow digestion; PCOD/thyroid issues; Insulin insensitivity. So make sure you eat between 4 and 6 pm – be it a handful of groundnuts or chana; jaggery, ghee and chapati (if you stay active and work away from home); even chaat/samosa, but only once a week! You will soon see dinner quantities naturally drop over the next 4-5 days.
