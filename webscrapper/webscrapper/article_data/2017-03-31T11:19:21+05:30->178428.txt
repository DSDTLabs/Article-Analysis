Vadodara: A farm labourer couple was sentenced to life imprisonment by the sessions court on Thursday for killing their five-year-old daughter, who was physically and mentally challenged in 2015.

 In July 2015, the accused   had registered a complaint at Shinor police station against his wife Sharda for killing their daughter Laxmi, who was born from his first wife. Barela told the police that on July 18, Sharda had thrashed   without any reason and when he tried to intervene, she fled away. Later, he realized that Laxmi had died.
 
 After few days, Barela’s employer’s son   met Sharda and told her that a complaint has been registered against her. Sharda then told Rathod that Barela was also involved in the murder. Sharda said that she was fed up doing daily chores for Laxmi who could neither move nor speak. When she expressed her anguish to her husband, he asked her to kill Laxmi. However, Sharda refused initially but later she banged the girl’s head on the floor. Barela then squeezed her with his leg and Sharda strangled her.
 
 Later, when police learnt the truth, they arrested the couple. 
 
 Additional public prosecutor   submitted circumstantial evidence and said that since the offence was committed inside the house, there were no eye witnesses. Moreover, Barela and Sharda were unable to explain the cause of Laxmi’s death. Chavan also told the court that it was a case of brutal killing as the couple eliminated her because they felt she was a burden on them.
 
 Also, 13 witnesses including ‘panch’ had turned hostile during the trial. 
 
 However, principal district and sessions judge J C Doshi upheld Chavan’s submissions and sentenced the couple to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs 3,000.
