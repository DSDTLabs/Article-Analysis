JERUSALEM : PM  's much-anticipated visit to Israel could take place in mid-2017 in what would be the first such tour by an Indian premier to the Jewish state, as the two countries mark 25 years of their diplomatic ties. 

  India's ambassador to Israel, Pavan Kapoor, told news portal 'Ynet' about the visit and mentioned about the efforts being taken to boost defence cooperation with Israel, which is looking to set up manufacturing units in India under the 'Make in India' initiative. 
 
  According to sources, the dates for Modi's visit have not been finalised, but "it is likely to happen in June-July of 2017". Modi's visit is being discussed amid talks of a "close chemistry" between him and Israeli PM  . 
 
  India-Israel ties have steadily progressed since the two countries established diplomatic relations in January 1992, but India has shied away from such high-level visits in the past. 
 
  However, the BJP-led government seems to have accorded a greater priority to this relationship with President Pranab Mukherjee visiting Israel in October 2015 in what was the first such visit by an Indian head of state to Israel.
