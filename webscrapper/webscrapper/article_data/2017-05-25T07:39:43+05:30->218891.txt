PUNE: Those on the look out for quirky, desi art and handicrafts will soon be able to access curios from across various states right here in the city. 

 Over five years after its first proposal, the civic body has finally kicked off the process for the third phase of the Pune-Okayama Friendship Garden, popularly known as Pu La Deshpande Udyan, on Sinhagad Road.
 
 According to Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) garden superintendent, Ashok Ghorpade, the new phase of the garden is named  , which translates to art village. It will feature a rural exhibition centre comprising 28 stalls to represent each state of the country.
 
 “Every stall will have artisans, representing the state, displaying and selling popular art forms and handicrafts. This way, citizens will be able to access the art forms in a single place throughout the year,” Ghorpade told TOI.
 
 In addition, there will also be a large open-air auditorium at the centre of the Kalagram, with a capacity to accommodate at least 200 audience members. “Regular dance recitals and performance arts events will be hosted at the auditorium. This will not only promote the performance artists but also popularise their art forms among residents,” he said.
 
 It may take a while before Kalagram comes to fruition. The project will take at least two years to complete. “The original plan had been proposed over five years ago. It was allocated funds only in this year’s PMC budget. Even with the approval for funds, it will take at least a month for building and plan approval, following which the project will take another two years to complete,” said Ghorpade.
