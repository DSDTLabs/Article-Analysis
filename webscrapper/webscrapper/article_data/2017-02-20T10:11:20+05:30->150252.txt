DEHRADUN: Congress alleged that Prime Minister  's election rally on February 10 violated the model code of conduct and demanded a case be filed against BJP leaders in this regard.

 A delegation of 24 party leaders, led by state Congress president Kishore Upadhyay submitted a memorandum in this regard to state chief electoral officer Radha Raturi on Sunday, party sources said.
 
 In the memorandum, the party claimed a case has been registered against Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi and Uttarakhand Chief Minister   for violating the model code even as they had permission for their roadshow.
 
 But, no such action was taken for Modi's rally in Haridwar's Rishikul grounds for which BJP did not have any permission, Congress complained in the memorandum.
 
 The party has requested the Election Commission that a case be filed against Modi and BJP leaders for violating the model code, sources said.
 
 Polling was held for 69 of 70 Assembly seats in Uttarakhand on February 15 and counting of votes will be taken up on March 11
