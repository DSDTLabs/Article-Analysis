LUCKNOW: Senior   leader   on Saturday said his party's association with   was here to stay as the primary aim of both parties was to fight for the uplift of underprivileged and to raise voice against any injustice. 

 The statement of Azam Khan, a party general secretary, is being seen as SP's attempt to reach out to BSP for a formal political alignment ahead of 2019 Lok   polls. This is the first time that any senior SP leader has talked about the possibility of the two parties coming together before 2019. 
 
 Talking about the possible alliance, he said that it should be based on a "ba-izzat" (respectable) formula and sharing. Dismissing assumptions about the SP-BSP alliance not lasting long, Azam said the two parties have always fought against injustices to the deprived and for betterment of the neglected which was a strong enough reason for them to bond.
 
 "One cannot be rigid while reaching out to people to make friends. If one is accommodative, it can lead to lasting relations," said Azam, lacing his statement with a couplet: "Khatam kardo gile, Aaj milkar gale;   yoonhi sahi, Hum bure tum bhale." (People should forget their differences and embrace each other, even while admitting a mistake never made). He said that he recited the same couplet before party president earlier in the day while calling for a truce between the two parties.
