VARANASI: Before the state police could solve the case of extortion threats received by over a dozen ruling party MLAs, now even   corporators in Varanasi have started getting threats. 

 Initially, a BJP corporator had lodged complaint with Bhelupur police a month go, alleging that someone threatened him of dire consequences. The number of corporators claiming to have received similar threats has gone above six in past two weeks. Only one case has been registered in this regard.
 
  R   said the matter is being probed and the caller would be traced soon. If party leaders are to be believed, a corporator from Jangambadi area first received a threat call and lodged a complaint with Bhelupur police. During investigation, police found that the corporator had been threatened over some old dispute, said the SSP while adding that probe is still on.
 
 However, before police could trace the caller, the number of BJP corporators receiving similar threats started increasing. BJP's district unit president   said police was informed in all cases and the issue was also reported to chief minister  . Vishwakarma claimed that crime branch and   have also been engaged in probe.
 
 BJP leaders and corporators who received threat calls are tight-lipped. Party sources said that the corporators have been asked not to disclose details until police arrest the caller. The SSP said that except the case registered with Bhelupur police, no other corporator has given any written complaint so far. He said that if they would give their complaints, separate cases would be registered. 
 
 The threat calls and messages for extortion received by over a dozen BJP MLAs had already left the state police sweating in May and probe has been ordered by state government. The motive behind threatening BJP corporators in Varanasi is not clear so far. The SSP claimed that that there is no similarity in the threats received by MLAs and those by the corporators.
