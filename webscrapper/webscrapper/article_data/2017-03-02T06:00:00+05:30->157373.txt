From hip-hop to salsa to ballet, the Hyderabadi audience were treated to an enchanting evening of Western dance at   recently. 
Organised by a prominent dance studio, the event began with some breathtaking performances by   and   who electrified the audience with their contemporary dance. Yildiz, who came all the way from Turkey, mesmerised the audiences with her dance moves.
 Up next was a jazz and funk performance by teen dancers. This was followed by a hip-hop performance on Sean Paul’s hit song, Crick Neck, by college students. 
 The dazzling performances didn’t end there. Lined up were contemporary dance performances by students of Yildiz. But, the highlight of the day was the ballet performance by kids as young as six years old. To watch these little ballerinas in white and pink tutus was a pleasure to the eyes and the audience were seen adoring every bit of their performance.
