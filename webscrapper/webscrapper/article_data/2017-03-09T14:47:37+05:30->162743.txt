NEW DELHI: The 19-year-old girl who was found murdered at her house in   on Monday evening was strangled by her cousin,  , as he was finding it difficult to support her.

 The girl’s uncle, Lakhi, had adopted her after her parents died in West Bengal when she was a child. She used to refer to Lakhi, a craftsman at a factory near Hasanpur in east Delhi, as her own father. He was worried about getting her married. His son, who was the earning member of the family, decided to kill her to cut down expenses.
 
 On Monday evening, Burman entered her room, put the radio on high volume and strangled her. He then smothered her with a pillow to ensure that she was dead. He tried to make it look like suicide, left the door open and went to pick up his mother, a domestic help. He dropped his mother at the house and left saying he would return soon. 
 
 When his mother went inside the house, she found the girl lying dead on the bed. She immediately called Burman and he informed the police. He cremated her body and led a protest demanding the arrest of the killers.
 
 “We got suspicious about Tapas as he gave contradictory statements. During interrogation, he confessed to having strangled her with a chunni. A case of murder was registered against him,” said DCP (east) Omvir Singh.
 
 The girl’s parents had died when she was 10 years old after which she started staying with her uncle along with her sister. She was studying in Class XII at a government school and was doing well in her studies. Burman told the police that they were worried about spending money on her wedding. “The girl also used to have arguments frequently with his mother and wife over domestic issues. All these factors combined motivated him to make the plan to kill her,” Singh said.
