GURUGRAM: A 62-year-old man, already retired as an executive from a private company, had bought a 500sq-yard plot from Huda in Sector 57 for Rs 20 lakh in 2004 and subsequently paid another Rs 28 lakh in 2014 as enhanced compensation to be paid to land owner(s).

 But even after waiting for 14 years, instead of getting possession of the plot,   recently received a fresh notice from Huda for another Rs 33.92 lakh.
 
 Hemant is among 150-odd allottees who had purchased plots from Huda in Sector 57 and are still waiting for possession even after paying the initial price and enhanced compensation. Sources said all of them had been served fresh notices by Huda, asking them to cough up an additional amount at the rate of Rs 6,784 per square yards.
 
 Hemant, who currently lives in New Colony of Old Gurugram, said he had paid Rs 4,000 per square yards at the time of the land purchase in 2004. “But Huda asked us to pay an additional amount at the rate of Rs 5,600 per square yards in 2014 as enhanced compensation. But even after making the full payment, I was not given the possession. And now, they have sent me another notice, asking me to pay more (Rs 6,784 per sq yards),” he added.
 
 Hemant said he had filed a few RTI applications, seeking details of the amount paid to land owners and the basis for calculation of the enhanced compensation.
 
 “The estate officer sent me to the chief account’s officer, who, in turn, sent me to the land acquisition officer. I made rounds of different offices but no one could give me a satisfactory answer,” he alleged.
 
 Huda estate officer-II Vivek   said the rate of the second recovery (Rs 6,784 per sq yards) had been decided on the basis of enhanced compensation awarded by the Punjab and Haryana high court in 2015 with regard to the land acquired for the development of Sector 57. 
 
 “Allottees from general category will have to pay Rs 6,784 (including interests) per square yards while those in the EWS category will have to pay Rs 966,” Kalia explained.
 
 According to the Haryana Urban Development (Disposal of Land & Building) Regulations, 1978, an allottee (who has got a plot from Huda) is liable to pay the additional amount (enhancement compensation) if land owner(s) is awarded a higher compensation by court.
 
 In 2004, Huda had planned Sector 57 and acquired 550 acres in Wazirabad and Ghata village for the purpose. A chunk of the said land was under litigation, yet Huda went ahead with the allottment process.
 
 In 2011, land owners challenged the acquisition in court, which eventually directed Huda to pay higher compensations. 
 
 Accordingly, Huda collected Rs 5600 per square yards from allottees in 2014. Not satisfied with the enhanced compensations, land owners filed another petition. Finally, the Punjab and Haryana high court directed Huda to pay more in 2015.
 
 Around 3,600 people were allotted plots in the sector, of which around 150 are yet to get the possession. Those who got the possessions have also been asked to pay the enhanced compensations.
 
 “If the HC order was passed in 2015 why did Huda wait for three years? Now, it has issued recovery notices, asking us to pay 15% annual interests (on the compensation amount decided),” said  , a resident of Sector 57.
