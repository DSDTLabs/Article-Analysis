 looks his fittest best in Mani Ratnam’s  . The actor, who plays a fighter pilot in the film, says that he has put in so much work to look exactly like them. “I wanted to understand my character a lot better, which is why I met a couple of them through my friend, who is a wing commander at  . I watched the way they behave, spotted the minute mannerisms, their hairdo and looked at how fit they were. Looking the part is important. So, I lost a lot of weight for this role. I hit the gym, changed the way I worked out and went on a particular diet, too. I had to do a lot of detox and watched what I ate.”

  He adds, “No matter how long you are at the gym, what you eat is what matters the most. When you are eating right, you can’t afford to go wrong with your food choices. So, I was being very careful about it. And eating right not just helped me lose weight, but feel brisk and positive, too. Honestly, I haven’t seen myself in this way in a long time,” shares Karthi.” Karthi is now shooting for Dheeran Athikaaram Ondru.
