Actress   said it was when she started doing Hindi films that she was trying to figure out who she really is, and fashion helped her to discover herself.

 "When I started working and started doing Hindi films, that was when I was really trying to figure out who I really am. That discovery gradually happened through fashion," Tamannaah said.
 
  
  
 
 "Fashion is a great medium to express who really you are as a person. It is not something I have woken up and known about. I think I can confidently say that now I don't feel I am working too hard for it," she added.
 
 The actress, who has featured in films like  ,  ,   and  , is an established name in southern cinema. One of her much-anticipated projects currently is the remake of Kangana Ranaut's 'Queen'.
 
 Talking about paying heed to the fashion police, she said she used to to do that initially.
 
 "I think that helped me. I am thankful to the criticism because I wouldn't have got better if I hadn't got the criticism. However harsh they might sound sometimes, it did help me," said the actress, who is excited about her new projects.
 
 "I am doing lot of south Indian films. I have just completed a Telugu film. It (my schedule) is jam-packed but I enjoy doing films. Being an actor, facing the camera, playing different characters... Because now is the time (for heroines) as different parts are written for women.
 
 "All the films I am doing are very female-centric, their subjects are female-centric. It's a great time to be doing such movies because the scope is there," said the actress.
