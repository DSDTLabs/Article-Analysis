AHMEDABAD: Gujarat chapter of   on Sunday took out a protest demonstration against   incidents carried out by   across the country. The demonstration was organised at Sardar Baugh in Lal Darwaja area of the city. Members of dalit communities also participated to show solidarity with their Muslim brethren facing persecution in the garb of cow protection.

 Hundreds of protesters stood on both sides of Nehru bridge with placards carrying various messages, including: ‘NotInMyName’, ‘Why So Silent’, ‘PM break the silence’, ‘Gaay Bano Surakshit Raho (be a cow and remain safe)’ and ‘I wish I were a cow’. 
 
  Children and youth were among the protesters wearing caps with the message, ‘I am Junaid’. It may be recalled that a teenager named, Junaid Khan, was allegedly lynched on June 22 in an EMU train going from   to Mathura.
 
 Mufti Abdul Qayyum Mansuri of Jamiat Ulma-i-Hind said that the protest was not about ensuring safety to one particular community but it was an attempt to save the Indian Constitution in a situation where law and order is deteriorating each passing day.
 
 “Today Muslims are being targeted. Perhaps some other community will be targeted another day. Given this state affairs, the violence may even plunge the country into civil war. Efforts are being made to trigger clashes between various communities in the came of caste, creed, community and now also in the name of cow,” Mansuri said. He further said that they had held a protest to save the Constitution and humanity in the country.
 
 Dr Jayanti Makadia, a dalit rights activist, said that dalits had participated in the protest because they were also becoming victims of gau rakshaks. “We have been protesting from July 11 last year when Una flogging happened. This is not the issue of a particular community but a question of ensuring justice to everybody,” Makadia said.
