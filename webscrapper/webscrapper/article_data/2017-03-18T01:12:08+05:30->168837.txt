Lucknow: All work, including civic cleaning in the city, is likely to remain stalled at Lucknow Municipal Corporation till next Tuesday as employees have gone on boycott following a faceoff between two unions of the corporation.

 The work at the Lucknow Muncipal Corporation had remained affected post Holi with several employees on leave.
 
 On Friday morning, when members of Nagar Nigam Evam Jal Kal Karmchari Sangh were protesting outside the LMC head office in Lalbagh, members of another union arrived at the spot and started tying black bands on the hands of workers from another group. 
 
 Shashi K Mishra, regional president of the union, said, “The other group was hijacking our programme and we objected to it. That resulted in a heated argument between the two sides.” As tempers soared, police were called to calm the two groups.
 
 Union members said most workers will boycott work on Saturday in protest. With Sunday being the weekly off, Monday being a local holiday and a statewide closure of work in municipal corporations and local bodies on Tuesday, LMC workers will not return to work before Wednesday. 
 
 More than three lakh employees of municipal bodies across the state will boycott work on Tuesday to demand payment of arrears.
