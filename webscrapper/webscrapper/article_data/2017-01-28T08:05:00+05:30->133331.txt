GURUGRAM: The   in the city, which appeared to be somewhat under control for a while now, could again spiral out of control. 

 A senior citizen in Sector 4 got badly injured and fractured his thigh bone, after being attacked by a group of monkeys when he was out for his morning walk. “My father, O P Bhatia, 67, was attacked by a group of large monkeys a few days ago. We had to rush him to hospital. It was very difficult for him to cope with surgery at this age, but he had to go through it and is now bedridden for a few months,” said his daughter Ruchi Bhatia, adding, “Already, we’ve spent around Rs 2 lakh on his treatment. This incident has adversely impacted his work and life a great deal. And this is all because authorities don’t pay attention to the concerns of citizens like us.”
 
 The situation has been precipitated after the agency hired by MCG to catch simians stopped working altogether, ostensibly to protest their not receiving promised wages. “We started working earlier this month, and managed to catch around 150 monkeys from various parts of the city,” said Aryan Chaudhary of  . He continued, “MCG officials had promised to pay us Rs 1,500 for every monkey we caught. However, so far, they have failed to give us even a single paisa. We’ve repeatedly met senior officials to demand the amount that was promised to us, but they have been unresponsive. That’s why we’ve been forced to stop work.” 
 
 Arpan Singh, who lives in Sector 56, had a similar complaint. “Often, it’s difficult to even step out of our homes, as the monkeys appear out of nowhere. And they attack the elderly and kids more. We hope officials will do something,” he said.
 
 MCG officials said they will look into the allegations made by the private agency and grievances of the residents, and take action accordingly.
