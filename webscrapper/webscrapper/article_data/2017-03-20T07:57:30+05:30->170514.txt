BATHINDA: A Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) activist from Bhangchari village in Muktsar,   (50), allegedly tried to commit suicide on Sunday by consuming poison when a police team had gone to his house to take him to the police station in connection with an altercation he had with a neighbour the night before. 

 Though the policemen and Bahadur’s family stopped him, he managed to gulp a few drops of the poison from a plastic bottle. He has been admitted to a hospital in Muktsar and is out of danger. Bahadur’s wife,  , is a member of Bhangchari’s panchayat. 
 
 The policemen had gone to Bahadur’s house to summon him to the police station, after his neighbour and AAP activist,  , had complained against him to the police. Khan had alleged that he had a dispute with Bahadur over a drain being laid in front of their houses and Bahadur abused him in an inebriated condition on Saturday night. 
 
 However, Bahadur’ son   said it was Khan who had abused his father. “Avtar also called the police. My father could not tolerate it and tried to commit suicide,” he said.
 
 When contacted, Lakhewali police station SHO Kewal Singh said no case had been registered against anyone so far. “I had sent the two policemen to Bahadur Singh’s home to settle the issue, but he tried to commit suicide. We will act only after recording Bahadur’s statement,” he said.
