 Bidhannagar MLA Sujit Bose, who has already changed the look of Lake Town by setting up manicured parks and installing smart streetlights, is planning to turn the service road from Lake Town to Ultadanga into a weekend Walking Street.
 
 “The idea is to have a street like the one in Pattaya for a few hours on the weekends. Here, people will be able to walk freely on the stretch with no cars plying,” Bose said. According to him, various stalls would be set up along the stretch and new activities would be introduced to make it a fun place. As of now, the authorities are eyeing weekend afternoons when the traffic pressure is less.
 
 The stretch has already turned into an attraction for locals. It hosts the Lake Town carnival that takes place during the Christmas and New Year’s Eve. The inspiration for the Walking Street comes from the success of the carnival. 
 
 Bose also has plans to spruce up the canal side from Lake Town to Bangur. Already, a small waterbody at Lake Town has been decorated and new lights have been installed along it. “There are also plans to set up subways in Lake Town and Bangur,” Bose said.
 
 Last year had been busy for Lake Town with the Kestopur canal getting a complete makeover. Work is going on in full swing to set up a joggers’ track. The Eastern Drainage canal, that divides Salt Lake from Sector V, will also undergo a beautification drive by the urban development department.
