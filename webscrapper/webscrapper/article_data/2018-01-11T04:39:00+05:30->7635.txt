Porvorim: Former   minister and Goa chief minister Manohar   said here on Wednesday that the negotiations to build 12 mine counter measure (MCM) vessels for the Indian Navy in collaboration with South Korean firm Kangnam Corporation failed due to “lacuna” in the tendering process.

 “What is cancelled is the consultant’s role. There were some defects in the tender which could not be rectified at this stage,” Parrikar said. “There was some difference between the request for proposal floated and the quote given by the Korean company, some lacuna,” he told TOI.
 
 Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL) will continue to build the 12 minesweepers for the Indian Navy after floating a fresh request for proposal seeking a technology partner, Parrikar said, adding that only the contract between   and Kangnam Corporation was scuttled.
 
 Earlier, speaking to reporters after the state cabinet meeting, he said the talks with the South Korean firm were cancelled since “certain terms and conditions set by the Korean company, were beyond the scope of the tender”.
 
 The Rs 32,000 crore   project will be executed by GSL after a fresh request for proposal for selection of the technology partner is floated. 
 
 Meanwhile, GSL is going ahead with the construction of a mine counter measure vessel command and control design centre.
 
 Asked if retendering the technology transfer process would lead to a delay in execution of the project, Parrikar said, “I believe in transparency.”
 
 Parrikar further said the minesweeper project is a long-term project, and can absorb the delay of a year or so.
 
 “What is cancelled is the process of selection of the foreign collaborator, not the order. The tender for consultants is being refloated. The delay is minimal, these are projects for eight years, 10 years and they can absorb the delay of one year,” Parrikar said.
