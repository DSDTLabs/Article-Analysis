  As per Article 174 of the  , the governor is allowed to summon the House in such a manner that six months shall not intervene between the last session and the next session. The last assembly session ended on August 31. The same article empowers the governor to dissolve the legislative assembly.
  
  Legal experts suggest that the state assembly be dissolved by the governor to avoid constitutional crisis, as six months would have passed since the last assembly session held on August 31, 2016 and the election results, scheduled for March 11. Before the governor dissolves the assembly, the cabinet has to recommend it. Experts say that the chief minister may continue as a caretaker till the new government is formed after the poll results are declared on March 11.
  
  Sources said that the government had decided to hold an assembly session in December last year. But, it did not materialize in view of the assembly elections.

  CM   said there is no need to dissolve the house. As the six-month period ends by early March, all eyes are now set on Lotlikar’s opinion and the future course of action taken by the council of ministers.
