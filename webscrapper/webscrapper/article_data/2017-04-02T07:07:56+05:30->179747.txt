Mumbai: Security at civic hospitals in Mumbai was beefed up on Saturday with the induction of 400 guards, said civic officials. Apart from these guards, including a few armed ones, the BMC has also set up alarm systems and began implementing the two-relatives-per-patient rule.

 The security upgrade follows the “mass bunk” by resident doctors at public hospitals after one of them was assaulted by relatives of a patient in   two weeks ago. The HC, while hearing a case of strikes by resident doctors, had asked the state government to increase security for doctors.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner I A Kundan said, “About 400 guards, including supervisory-level officials, have been inducted. They will only check entry points.” She said CCTV cameras too are being used to monitor the activities at hospitals. “We are also implementing the two-relatives-per-patient rule strictly and have clearly demarcated OPD areas,” she said, adding that alarms have been set up along with signages and help desk. 
 
 Dr   of the Central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) said that organization welcomed the move but said there is a need to ensure these measures are permanent. 
 
 Dr  , academic dean of KEM Hospital, said, “Guards will work in three shifts. While the first shift will have 29, there will be 19 in the afternoon and 20 at night. Each shift will have four armed guards.” More guards will be inducted if needed, he said.
 
 Dr Suleman Merchant, dean of Sion Hospital, said 93 Maharashtra   guards were posted at his hospital. “We have also started an emergency hotline for all employees (3374) to activate Rapid Action Force for prompt response,” he said.
