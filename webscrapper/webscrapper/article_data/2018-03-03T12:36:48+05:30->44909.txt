MUMBAI: ‘What women want’, the title of a Hollywood rom-com might spell mystery, but there cannot be too many doubts about what authorities and traditions want of women.

 When   signed an executive order in January 2017 barring non-US organizations from receiving US funds if they give information and referrals for abortion, provide safe abortion or plead for better abortion legislation even if they use their own or other people’s funds, it landed a three-pronged assault on families, fertility, and feminism—landmarks in women’s rights movements over their bodies and lives, especially in developing countries where feminists are still struggling against orthodoxies to make abortion legal and safe.
 
 To counter Trump’s  , —first introduced by Ronald Reagan in 1984 under the name of the Mexico City Policy, which has typically been eliminated by Democrats and reinstated by Republicans depending on who was in control of the White House—Lilianne Ploumen (54), the   of foreign trade and development cooperation, sounded a clarion call for action that following March.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 In an attempt to fill the gaps and raise money for aid groups whose funding was threatened under the new order, Ploumen banded together a rallying cry: ‘He does not decide, she decides what she wants to do with her body’ that following March and she dialled friends in ministries in various countries, and in six weeks pulled off a pledging conference titled   in Brussels that pooled in 181 million euros with grants from Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. All donations to the crowdfunding campaign , that has seen incredible momentum in the past one year, are directed at organizations—over 1,300 worldwide—affected by the Global Gag Rule.
 
 After mobilizing 50 governments and 40,000 people including youth leaders, parliamentarians, UN representatives, grassroots activists, legal professionals, academics, artistes and private foundations, who have pledged their commitment to ensure that “she decides”, the international campaign is now making its way to India with its launch in Mumbai on Saturday, followed by Delhi.
 
 “The slashing of US funds for healthcare and family planning services hasn’t hit India as severely as some other countries given the pro-abortion laws in place, but there is great desire and resonance for the movement, something I figured after visits and dialogues with 80 organizations across Mumbai, Delhi, Gujarat and Kolkata since August,” says Robin Gorna, co-lead in the SheDecides support unit, in the midst of steering 200 young people and politicians in South Africa, the nation hit hardest by the move.
 
 The movement in India championed by human rights lawyer Indira Jaising is meant to amplify voices of those often locked out of global conversations and address issues such as early and forced marriage, domestic violence and transgender rights alongside the entire spectrum of sexual and reproductive rights and health including safe abortion, access to modern contraceptives, counselling, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.
 
 With March 2 as the first anniversary of this anti-Trump feminist movement, SheDecide’s take-off in Mumbai is designed to be playful and serious; creative and academic in partnership with ReRight, a charitable trust helmed by Subarna Ghosh whose campaign in addressing indiscriminate and rising number of caesarean surgeries had forced the government to take action last year; and ArtistsAnonymous, a collective of performers. 
 
 While spoken word artistes and musicians will create compelling messages on Saturday evening, a ‘Ted’ style talk by a gathering of experts in the following days is meant to explore laws and devise an action plan in sync with the SheDecides manifesto of pushing towards a change in policies, committing funds and getting involved in the movement. “We’ve had preliminary discussions with minister Smriti Irani and health officials, while Maneka Gandhi, who pledged her support at the SheDecides conference last year, has promised to take it further once we have an advocacy agenda in place,” says Robin.
