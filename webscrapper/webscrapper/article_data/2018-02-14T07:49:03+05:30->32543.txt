RAJKOT: In a horrific incident, a nine-year-old girl was allegedly raped and then smothered to death by her 15-year-old stepbrother in Jamnagar on Monday night. 

 The boy Kishore (name changed) first raped the girl, thrashed her with a cricket stump and then smothered her to death with a pillow in their house in Krishnagar locality. After killing her, Kishore called up their relative living in Mayurnagar area and told them that the girl had fallen from the bed and suffered injuries. When their relative reached the house, he noticed that the girl was not breathing and immediately rushed her to the hospital. Doctors however declared her dead on admission.
 
 When police reached the hospital on Tuesday morning, Kishore again repeated his version and told them that his stepsister had fallen from the bed at around 5:30am. She suffered head injuries and he put her to sleep again on the bed. However, police noticed injury marks on both her eyes, chin, abdomen and some branding like marks on the soles. They got suspicious and asked the doctors to conduct a detailed postmortem. The autopsy revealed that the girl was sexually assaulted. On detailed questioning, Kishore confessed to the rape and said that he had smothered her with a pillow till she died. 
 
 Police said, Kishore is the son from the second wife of the rape victim’s father. He also has a sister. A week ago, his mother, a native of Karnataka, had left them and returned home after a tiff with their father. The man lodged a missing person’s report after she left the house without telling anyone. On Monday, they got to know that she had returned to Hoobly in Karnataka. The man and his daughter left Jamnagar to fetch her. 
 
 “As there was no one at home, Kishore allegedly raped his stepsister. However, he got terrified thinking what if she revealed everything to the parents. So, he decided to kill her,” said a C-Division police station.
