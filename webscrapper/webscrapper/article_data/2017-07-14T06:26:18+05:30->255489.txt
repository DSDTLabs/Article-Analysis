New  : The special cell arrested two gunrunners and   20 UP-made   from them. Police have also busted the factory which the   had set up at Etah in UP. 

 The gang supplied more than 500 pistols to criminals in the NCR in the past few months.
 
 “Huge cache of partly prepared firearms, raw material and instruments used in manufacturing weapons has been recovered along with 180 live cartridges of 0.32 bore,” said DCP (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav.
 
 The accused Ramgopal alias Fauji (52) and Naseem alias Jabir (37) had set up the factory five years ago and have supplied over 5,000 pistols till date.
 
 The cost of manufacturing a pistol is between Rs 8,000-10,000. Ramgopal sold it for Rs 25,000 per pistol to criminals in Delhi and NCR.
 
 Two teams led by inspectors Attar Singh and Jeetendra Tiwari were tasked to bust the factories. “On Tuesday, head constable Parvez Alam received information about Ramgopal coming to Ansari road in Daryaganj. A team under ACP Pankaj Sood reached the spot and apprehended him and seized 10 pistols. A day later, Naseem was also nabbed from Agra with eight pistols,” DCP Yadav said.
 
 A raid was then conducted at Ramgopal’s house, which was their makeshift factory. Two more pistols, semi-finished pistols and four magazines were recovered. 
 
 Ramgopal told police that he met Naseem 10 years ago and got drawn to this trade. “Naseem has several cases against him in Bihar. He learnt to make pistols at an age of 15 and has been in the trade since 20 years,” Yadav said.
 
 Initially, the accused used to procure semi-finished pistols from Munger and sold them at a higher price after giving some finishing touches. Five years ago, they shifted the manufacturing unit from Bihar to Ramgopal’s house due to mounting police pressure.
