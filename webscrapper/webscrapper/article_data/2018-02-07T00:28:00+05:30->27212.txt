Madurai: Executive Engineer of Zone 2 S M Rajendran on Tuesday expressed optimism that the sewage flow in Panthalkudi channel will be fixed within a month’s time as city the corporation is working to plug all the sewage leaks into the channel. Panthalkudi channel falls within Zone 2 of the corporation. There was heavy breach in the pumping line across the channel at MM Lodge area several months ago. As the breach was underneath, the leak was not noticed for a long time, Rajendran said. “We have been working on fixing the leak for a while. We will replace the pipe for eight meters. The leak will be fixed by Wednesday”, he said. The corporation will be able to prevent discharge of three to four MLD (Million Litres per Day) when the major leaks are fixed. In addition, the corporation has undertaken a survey to check all sewage outlets, including the one at Alwarpuram, based on the instructions of Corporation Commissioner Aneesh Sekhar. “The commissioner is particular that all the inlets are studied and fixed so that sewage flow into Panthalkudi will be stopped permanently. It may take a month’s time,” Rajendran said. He dismissed allegations that corporation was not collecting garbage, resulting in its dumping in the channel. The civic body undertakes regular mass cleaning drive and keeps garbage bins wherever required, urging people to dispose their trash in them. Public support is also required to keep the channel clean of garbage, he added.
