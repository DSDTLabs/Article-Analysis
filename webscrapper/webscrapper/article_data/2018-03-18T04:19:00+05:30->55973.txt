Ahmedabad: After the brutal murder of an angadia firm employee on Friday morning, city police on Friday afternoon and evening convened emergency meetings with the angadia firms at police station and zonal levels.

 A K Singh, city police commissioner, said that the initiative was to create awareness about the security issues for the sector and also to ensure that such incidents don’t take place. “Areas with large concentration of angadia firms already have CCTV cameras installed and the firms also use technology like GPS. However, the meeting was about safeguards and where police can offer help,” he said, adding that investigation in the Friday incident is going on based on leads.
 
 The issue of vulnerability of angadia firms had cropped up in past few years with rise in targeted assaults. City police along with angadia association had taken the lead to install cameras. 
 
 A senior police official said the danger comes from the predictability of routine. “We have imparted a few practical tips and have also offered escort when necessary,” said the official.
