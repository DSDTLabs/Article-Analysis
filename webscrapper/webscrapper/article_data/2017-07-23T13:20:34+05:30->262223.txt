GREATER NOIDA: Four criminals of   were arrested after an encounter with police in   in connection with the sensational   case. The accused have been identified as Raju, Rakesh, Jai Singh and Deepak. Police said one of the criminals received bullet injury in the exchange of fire and he was admitted in a government hospital in Delhi. 

 Police have found a gold chain, a gold ring, victim's mobile phone from their possession. Four other gang members are still absconding.
 
 These criminals had waylaid a car just a kilometre from the   in Greater Noida in the early hours of May 25, dragged its eight passengers to a field and allegedly gang-raped the four women among them.
  
  
 
 
 The four male passengers were made to squat, tied up execution-style with the women’s dupattas and thrashed before one of them, a 38-year-old scrap dealer, was shot in the chest from point-blank range because he had put up a resistance. He bled to death on the spot. His wife (35), sister (35) and sister-in-law (50) were among the women in the gang’s clutches.
 
 The ambush, by planting spikes on the road to deflate the Eeco’s tyres, had a chilling similarity with last July’s attack on a Ghaziabad-based family in Bulandshahr in which a woman and her teenaged daughter were gang-raped, allegedly by the Bawariya gang. The place where that happened, a village called Dostpur, is barely 40km from the spot of Thursday night’s attack.
 
 The victims’ family members expressed satisfaction over the arrest. “We have not seen the accused arrested in this case. The arrests have been made after around two months. We feel justice is delivered, finally,” said family member who was one of the victims.
