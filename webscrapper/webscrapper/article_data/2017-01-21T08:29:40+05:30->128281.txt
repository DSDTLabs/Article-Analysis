LUDHIANA: A large number of SAD workers and office-bearers of its affiliated organizations on Friday protested against SAD candidate and sitting MLA from   Singh Dhillon and resigned from their posts while declaring that they would not vote for him.

 The protesters said Dhillon got 417 FIRs registered against SAD workers in the past five years, who either belonged to rival group or raised voice against him. Led by Surinder Singh Grewal, senior vice-president of  , several workers gathered at a marriage palace near   and shouted slogans against Dhillon. Speaking to TOI, Grewal said, “We all worked day and night to ensure Dhillon's win last time but he did nothing except getting FIRs lodged against his own workers. During his five-year tenure, he got 417 FIRs lodged against all those who opposed him and false cases were registered against women and children too.“
 
 “We had already communicated to high command that his ticket should be cancelled but about a week ago, we were told that since he was a sitting MLA, his ticket could not be cancelled.After discussions with workers , it was decided that we will not support Dhillon. If he again comes to power, his atrocities will increase. We have therefore resigned from our posts, but not from SAD and we have also decided that we will not vote for SAD in these elections,“ Grewal added.
