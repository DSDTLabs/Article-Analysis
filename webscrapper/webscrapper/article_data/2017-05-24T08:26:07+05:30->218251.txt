CHENNAI: Pressure is mounting on the   government from within   as 10 more   called on the   at the secretariat on Tuesday, ostensibly to discuss problems relating to their constituencies. 

 Sources said among other things, the legislators sought cabinet berths and positions though there was no official statement from the CMO. The meeting comes a day after eight MLAs led by three former ministers met the chief minister and wanted him to convene the party legislators' meeting immediately.
 
 MLAs C Chandrasekaran (Senthamangalam) S Gunasekaran (Tirupur south), K V Ramalingam (Erode West), K Uma Maheswari (Vilathikulam), I S Inbadurai (Radhapuram), P Vetrivel (Perambur), B Satyanarayanan (T Nagar), M Parameswari (Manachanallur) and K S Thennarasu (Erode East) met the chief minister on Tuesday. 
 
 "When   assumed charge as AIADMK general secretary, she made some promises, but none of them have been fulfilled. We also wanted to know who is leading the party now," one of the MLA, seeking anonymity, told TOI. In their public statements to journalists, they, however, maintained that they had raised issues like water shortage in their constituencies during their meeting with the CM.
