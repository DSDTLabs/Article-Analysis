LUCKNOW: People mostly affected with   ( ) are from Dalit and   communities and areas, said state health minister   in Lucknow on Wednesday. Singh added this was due to lack of   and sanitation in these areas.

 Talking to reporters in the city, Singh announced the launch of JE vaccination campaign to be held from May 25 to June 11 in 38 districts of the state. “Those who are more interested in going to Saharanpur and shedding tears there, should instead join the campaign against the disease spreading out of Dalit and minority areas,” he added. 
 
 With only a 60% target rate of vaccination in previous years, Singh said a total of 88,57,125 children between the age of 1 and 15 have been identified by the department under the programme, for which, 1 crore vaccines have been procured from Central government. 
 
 “It was seen that it negligent mothers did not ensure vaccination of children when it was time and those are the kids being targeted in the campaign,” he said. Singh added that for maximum impact of the vaccine, the first shot should be given to a child between 9 and 12 months, followed by a second and final dose when he or she is 16-24-month-old.
 
 The campaign will be inaugurated by chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi from Kushinagar on Thursday followed by 37 other ministers made responsible for each of the remaining 37 districts under the programme. Singh also said it was Yogi in 1998 who had first raised the issue of JE as not just a state concern it was a national issue and the vaccination programme was first started in 2006-2007.
 
 Citing AES (Acute encephalitis syndrome) that manifests itself also in the form of brain fever, dengue, malaria and other vector-borne diseases, Singh said, “There is currently no vaccine available for AES which is causing more deaths than JE, and cleanliness should be the way to prevent it till then.”
