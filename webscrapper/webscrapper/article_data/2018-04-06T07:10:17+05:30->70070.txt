HYDERABAD: Two accused, who were allegedly responsible for the death of 26 blackbucks in   on August 7, 2016, are yet to face trial.  , 32, and  , 40, were arrested and sent to judicial remand but are out on bail with the chargesheet yet to be filed , official sources said.

 Forest officials who conducted a preliminary investigation found that the blackbucks lying on the banks of the   in   village, had been poisoned . I Prakash, District Forest Officer (DFO), Wanaparthy, told TOI on Thursday: “The chargesheet will be filed very soon and the accused prosecuted. We have all the evidence against them and will present it in court.”
 
 Cases have been booked against the two under Section 51 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, which provides for five years in jail as punishment if convicted.
 
 Official sources said a Preliminary Offence Report (POR) was immediately filed by the forest department and the case was registered in a Mahbubnagar court.
 
 Interestingly, though blackbucks are a protected species, the ones found poisoned were not in ‘protected territory' when they died. In search of food and water they had strayed onto a piece of land, where a villager was cultivating maize. The blackbucks were fed pesticide mixed with water.
 
 “Cultivation was taking place on government land. The accused were not supposed to cultivate anything there,” said a forest department official.
