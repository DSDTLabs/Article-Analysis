NEW DELHI: There’s good news for those who bought   two-wheelers on or before March 31 this year. Registration of such vehicles, which had stopped after the   ordered deadline, is going to be allowed. The Delhi government has ordered registration of BS-III two-wheelers sold on or before March 31 following a high   order on May 8.

 The development comes as a relief for car dealers who had sold BS-III vehicles till March 31, but were not able to get them registered as the regional transport offices (RTOs) were not accepting the documents after the deadline set by Supreme Court. Around 1,000 such two-wheelers are awaiting registration in Delhi.
 
 The transport department, in its order, has said that the RTOs concerned will have to strictly ensure that the two-wheelers were sold on or before March 31 before registering them. “The registering authority will take into account the proof of online payment or the issuance of an insurance policy online on or before March 31 in the name of the purchaser,” the order said. The licencing officer will be held responsible for violation in case the documents were not issued on or before the said date.
 
 The deadline for production of vehicles before the motor licencing officers has already been extended to May 15. However, the direction would only be applicable to “non-self-registering dealers” who cannot pay sales tax online.
 
 Several vehicle dealers had moved HC saying the transport department was not accepting the documents for registration of vehicles even though they were sold before March 31. Supreme Court, on March 29, had banned the sale and registration of vehicles that were not BS-IV compliant from April 1, the day new emission norms came into force.
