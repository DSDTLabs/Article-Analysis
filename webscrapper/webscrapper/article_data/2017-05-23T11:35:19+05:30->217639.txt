NASHIK: Minister of state for home   appreciated efforts of the city police for starting the ‘No   day’ initiative every Monday.

 “Such initiatives will bring more awareness among citizens about noise pollution,” he said.
 
 The city police started this initiative from April 24 and the response has been enthusiastic not only from the residents but also from police officials and personnel who are implementing it every Monday in their respective jurisdictions.
 
 Taking this into account, Patil showered praise on the enthusiasm shown by the city police in implementing the No Horn Day. “The concept will spread more awareness among the citizens about the disadvantages of noise pollution and it will eventually come down,” he said.
 
 Commissioner of police Ravinder Kumar Singal said, “We had conducted a survey to check if noise pollution was less during No Horn Days. According to our officials, who conducted the survey, with the help of the sound meters, the sound level came down by 8 to 10 decibels during the No Horn day, compared to the other days at junctions where the police appeal people from refraining from honking.”
 
 Meanwhile, a large number of people said they were feeling good when they did not honk unnecessarily. Senior police officials added that the response to the initiative was enthusiastic. Not only people who joined the police in implementing the No Horn Day were enthusiastic, but those who were asked to not honk for the day were pleased by the appeal.
 
 Sachin Jawale, a college student from the   area, said, “It is a good feeling when you realise that you are not contributing to the noise pollution. I came across police officials on a number of occasions during Mondays after which I decided to give it a try. In ensuring that I do not honk, I have actually started to ride my bike more cautiously.”
