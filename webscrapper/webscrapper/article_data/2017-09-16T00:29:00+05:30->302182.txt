Bhopal: State PCC president Arun Yadav launched a scathing attack on the BJP-ruled Central and state government for spiralling prices of petrol and diesel.

 “Common man is being looted as there is no connection between international prices of crude oil and petrol and diesel prices in the country. It applies to the state, where the state government levied highest VAT making it most expensive among states,” Arun Yadav said speaking to TOI on Friday.
 
 The state Congress chief argued the BJP repeatedly made an issue of fuel prices during the UPA regime. “That was the time when crude oil price was $147 per barrel and yet the Manmohan Singh government subsidised fuel with thousands of crores of rupees,” Yadav said. “Today, price of crude oil has hit rock bottom at only $47 per barrel and common man is purchasing it at Rs 79 in the state.”
 
 Yadav alleged that that far from subsidising fuel price, the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, which promised “Achhe Din (good days)” to people of this country is extorting an excess of Rs 34 to Rs 40 per litre on diesel and petrol. Additionally, in a state like Madhya Pradesh, the BJP government is levying a VAT of Rs 20 per litre on petrol.
 
 Congress party is soon going to launch an agitation on bullock-carts against rising price of fuel in the state. “When fuel price increased during the UPA regime, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said he would go to the state secretariat on a bicycle,” Yadav said. “Now, we will travel by bullock carts to show the discrepancy in prices of crude and fuel in the state,” he said.
