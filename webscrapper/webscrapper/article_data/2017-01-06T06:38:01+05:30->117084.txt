MUMBAI: After two years of undergoing renovation, Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital in   for children has opened its heritage gates for patients again. For this period, the pediatric patients were housed in the neighbouring  .

 “We have started moving pediatric patients to the renovated building, but more features will be added in the next couple of months,“ said Dr  , CEO of the Wadia Group of Hospitals. The hospitals are a unique example of public private partnership between the Wadia Trust, the BMC and the state government.
 
 Of the 350 beds in the renovated hospital, 150 will be neonatal intensive care beds. “We have already started 100   beds and will operate add 50 more when we start our cardiac heart surgery department next week,“ said Dr Bodhanwala, adding that the hospital additionally has 50 beds in the maternity wing. “Thus, Wadia hospital will have the largest number of NICU beds in the city ,“ she said. Funds for the makeover, especially the setting up of the cardiac unit, came from contributions raised during three annual running events. “We have already started getting enquires from donors about sponsoring heart operations for children,“ said the doctor.
 
 The idea of a heart centre came about because the hospital receives six pediatric patients with heart problems every week. “We have so far raised funds for the children but had to transfer them to other hospitals in the city for operations. Now, we have a full-time pediatric heart surgeon and a team to operate on the children at affordable rates.“
