BIKANER: Following an agreement with the government, the farmers had called off their 12-day-old protest on Saturday. But Section 144 of CrPC is in force at Lunkaransar block of   till 5 pm of July 16. People are barred from carrying weapons or assembling. This has been done to enforce law and order.

 CPI-M leader   said the government had acceded to the demands of farmers. It had agreed to look sympathetically upon farmers against whom cases were registered in the course of the protest. The government had also agreed to release more water to farmers, and agreed to take care of stray cattle in gaushalas so that they do not cause havoc in the fields.
 
 The state government engaged in dialogue with farmers to end the deadlock on Saturday. Water resources minister Rampratap and senior bureaucrats were present to negotiate with farmers on Saturday. Even leader of the Youth Congress Rajendra Bhadu pitched in during negotiations.
 
 A 12-day protest by farmers witnessed violence on Friday, as farmers tried to forcibly leave stray cattle at the premises of district authorities.
 
 The farmers had struck upon this mode of protest as authorities earlier restricted the flow of water to their fields â€“ from the earlier 3.90 cusecs being released from the Kanwar Sain Canal, farmers were allowed only 3 cusecs.
 
 Farmers said their fields were starved of water, and had been sitting in protest for 12 days.
