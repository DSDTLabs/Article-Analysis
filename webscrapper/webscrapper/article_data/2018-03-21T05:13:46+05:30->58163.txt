MUMBAI: The   (MMRCL) on Tuesday denied that the land at   is a “naturally forested area” or a “pristine area of land” with “dense tree cover”. 

 In an additional affidavit tendered before the Bombay high court the   3 nodal agency denied that the car shed area carved out for it at Aarey Colony is completely uninhabited as “incorrectly alleged’’ by activists.
 
  government had in February 2016 submitted before the National Green Tribunal that the 1,287 hectares of “Aarey Colony has not been recognized, notified and/or identified and demarcated as forest land in any record,” said MMRCL. The plot allotted for the Metro depot is not in any core green area, said MMRCL. “A major part of the plot was grasslands used as grazing ground”. The 30-odd hectares include the depot for Metro line-3, main line that connects the depot to the underground corridor and station.
 
 The HC is hearing a PIL that challenges as unconstitutional and invalid, the change of user from ‘No Development Zone’ (NDZ) to a Metro shed for over 80 acres—33 hectares—in Mumbai’s only major “green lung’’—Aarey colony. The area set aside by the state last November for the shed is close to four Oval Maidans.
 
 At a hearing before a bench of Justice S C Dharmadhikari and Justice PD Naik, senior counsel Aspi Chinoy appeared for MMRCL, the nodal agency for implementation of Mumbai Metro 3, and requested that additional facts be allowed to be placed on record. The bench questioned how MMRCL was filing documents on issues, which the state ought to be doing. The court permitted MMRCL to submit its additional affidavit and allowed petitioner Amrita Bhattacharjee to file a rejoinder, but turned down a request from the state to file an additional affidavit too. The HC will start the final hearing on April 9.
