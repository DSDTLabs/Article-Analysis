Sudhir Sonawane (25), also accused in a   case, told the minor that he wanted to show her how a rape happened and asked her if she watched a popular TV crime show. While pronouncing the sentence, special judge Rekha Pandhare reprimanded the accused and said such shows were meant to act as a deterrent for people intending to commit such crimes.

She bumped into a boy from her neighbourhood and they began to chat. The boy left when the accused, who was not known to her, arrived. He threatened to tell her parents that she was speaking to a boy. He claimed he was a cop and asked her if she watched the TV show which dramatized real-life instances.

She said he then told her that he would show her how rape happens and tried to show her video clips. 
 
 Luckily, her mother and two maternal aunts happened to arrive in an autorickshaw. The cops were called and he was held.
