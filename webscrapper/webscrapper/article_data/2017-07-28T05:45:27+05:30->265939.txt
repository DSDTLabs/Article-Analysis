MUMBAI: A 28-year-old alleged habitual molester has been arrested by officials of the crime branch of the city police. The accused,  , had molested several women including collegians around   in the   area, the police said, adding that he had unleashed terror among morning walkers.

 Sayyed's latest scooter model helped the police identify and arrest him. He had been arrested in 2012 in a rape case, and was released within a year as he promised to marry the victim.
 
 Senior inspector   said that many morning walkers had complained about a young rider in a windsheeter molesting women. Blurred images from cameras in the area pointed to a brown scooter. “This scooter was of the latest model of that brand. The police found out from bike dealers that this new series had been bought by 900 people. Further scrutiny helped them zero in on 100 of them and this list was further filtered down to those from Bandra and Khar.
 
 Assistant police inspector Nitin Patil said, “Once we identified  , we kept a watch on his movements. Subsequently, we laid a trap and nabbed him.“
 
 Police said Sayyed admitted he mostly targeted women and collegians walking alone.
