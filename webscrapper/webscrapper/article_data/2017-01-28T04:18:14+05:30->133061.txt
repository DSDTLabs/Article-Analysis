NEW DELHI: IndiGo has turned down the Delhi airport’s proposal to split its domestic flights between the choked Terminal 1D and Terminal 2, which will soon be made operational. The low-cost carrier has made it clear that it wants all its domestic flights under one roof.

 “We will support all efforts that make things better without splitting our domestic operations out of Delhi and thereby creating inconvenience to our customers,” said IndiGo spokesman Ajay Jasra.
 
 Low-cost carriers IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir operate their domestic flights from T1 in Delhi, while  ,  , Vistara and AirAsia India use T3 for all their flights.
 
 With T1D becoming a nightmare for flyers, especially during peak hours, DIAL CEO I P Rao had given some options to the three low-cost carriers. These included relocating some flights from T1 to T2; from February 1, having all new flights at T2 or a higher frequency at the terminal; and from February 15, shifting their flights to Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata from T1 to T2.
 
 While SpiceJet and GoAir did not officially take a stand, a senior official from one of these airlines said: “It is a ludicrous suggestion. If our plane flies in from Lucknow and comes to T1 and then it has to fly to Mumbai, it will have to cross an active runway to reach T2. This entire process will increase time and cost. We are waiting for a sensible suggestion to decongest T1.”
 
 Another official said, “The only acceptable option is to shift some airlines fully from T1 to T2. DIAL should speak to the airlines and act before the summer travel season starts mid-April”.
 
 DIAL has refused to talk about its course of action. Apart from giving relief to the flyers, decongestion of T1 is also needed so that DIAL can start work to expand its capacity from 2 crore passengers per annum to 3.5 crore per annum.
