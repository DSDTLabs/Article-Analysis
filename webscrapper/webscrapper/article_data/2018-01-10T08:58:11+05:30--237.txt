Mumbai will always hold special place in heart for it is here that I won my first ever marathon — the inaugural edition way back in 2004. We had to do two loops of the Peddar Road hill stretch and the event was held in the month of February. I did not clock the timing I was expecting but I was just too happy to win the event.

 
 It was in Mumbai I met so many greats, like Sachin Tendulkar, superstar athletes like  ,  , and all those Bollywood stars.
 
 It was my first trip to India and Mumbai. I have subsequently come to Mumbai in 2013 and 2016. But the Mumbai of 2004 was different to the present. I am happy that the race has grown in stature and has a new sponsor. I am also glad to know that the man who sponsors the race is himself a runner. We need such kind of encouragement all over the world.
 
 My victory in 2004 set me up nicely for greater things and also gave me the confidence I needed to start doing well in big city marathons. I ran and won the New York marathon the same year in November and it was big boost to my career. In 2004 I also competed in the Athens marathon.
 
 When I came to Mumbai in 2004, I was younger. Now I am 45 years old and am doing more things. I am a coach, I run my sports foundation and am a parent to two young children. I may be older but am still passionate about running and that’s why I will come to Mumbai in the role of a pace setter for elite runners.
