Be it his action-packed avatars in 'Dhoom 2' and 'Krrish', or the differently abled characters in ' ', 'Guzaarish' and the recently released ' ',   has essayed every role with panache. While each film has earned him accolades, the actor says that playing differently abled characters has had a deeper impact on his life. 

 For example, Hrithik’s portrayal of   in Sanjay Gupta’s 'Kaabil' is being counted among his finest performances so far. However, the superstar says that box-office success and appreciation are not his only takeaways from the movie. He says, “I am glad that the film has done well, but as actors, we also look for something more permanent than a good collection at the ticket counters. I was going through a difficult phase while shooting for it. I needed to fight my limitations in order to portray the character.” 
 
 Hrithik adds, “I gained an invaluable understanding during the course of 'Kaabil'. I realised for the first time that the phrase, ‘differently abled’, is not just a polite word for addressing the disabled; they are ACTUALLY differently abled. I didn’t play Rohan as a visually challenged guy, I played a man who believes in himself. My way of seeing them has changed forever.”
 
 Call it a coincidence, but there’s a common thread between Rohan, Rohit ('Koi Mil Gaya') and Ellen Mascarenhas ('Guzaarish') — they are all emotionally intelligent. The actor elaborates, “Perhaps I connect with these characters at some level. I have had my share of struggles with my physical self. I stammered as a kid and I know how socially awkward and debilitating it can get. It is a coincidence that I have played so many differently abled characters, but my directors have helped me each time.”
