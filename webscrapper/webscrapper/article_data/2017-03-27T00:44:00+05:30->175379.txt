Chennai: Tamil Nadu   Committee president S Thirunavukkarasar on Sunday announced the constitution of a committee to retrieve its properties located across the state. The committee, headed by senior partyman and advocate R Gandhi, has G Masilamani, an advocate, as joint president, M Muthusamy as vice-president, former MLA K Selvaperunthagai as convenor and 15 members.

 Senior Congress leaders and freedom fighters and philanthropists, who were sympathisers of the party, had donated land and properties across the state, said Thirunavukkarasar in a party press release. “Due to mismanagement of the party’s trusts in the districts, people have occupied the properties illegally and in several other places, they lie neglected,” he said, justifying the need for a committee to retrieve the properties and ensure they make profits.
 
 Congress properties are spread across districts including Coimbatore, Salem, Vellore, Trichy and Tirunelveli. “Miscreants have squatted on some properties and some others are involved in legal disputes. We hope to ensure all our   are eventually profit-making,” said a senior leader. He said all factions of the party, barring that led by former TNCC chief E V K S Elangovan, had been represented in the committee. Former TNCC chief M Krishnasamy’s son M K Vishnuprasad has been included in the committee.
 
 Except in Chennai, most of the Congress trusts in the districts are poorly managed, said the leader. Eventually, all the properties would be retrieved and brought under the TNCC Charitable Trust for better management, he said.
