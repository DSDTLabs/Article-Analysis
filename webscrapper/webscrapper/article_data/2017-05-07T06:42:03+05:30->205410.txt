 After sending Ashok home, Chandra told her neighbour that her husband who was heavily drunk, collapsed and died. The next day, she kept the body for public viewing and shed tears on Singh’s early demise. Around 4pm, she took the body to Hebbal crematorium to perform the last rites.
 
 However, owing to her bad luck, someone called JC Nagar police station alleging that Chandra was in an illicit relationship and a man had been seen near her house. The caller also claimed that Singh’s death was a murder.
 
 JC Nagar police immediately informed Amruthahalli police, asking them to stop the cremation. Cops arrived at the crematorium in the nick of time and took custody of the body. During interrogation, Chandra cracked and confessed to the crime.
