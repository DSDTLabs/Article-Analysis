NAVI MUMBAI: The decomposed body of a woman, aged around 30-35 years, was found inside a metal trunk dumped in a dry drain near   on Wednesday morning. Sources in   police said the woman was strangled to death and her face disfigured by pouring boiling water to prevent identification. 

 The trunk was spotted by a security guard of GAIL (India) Pvt Ltd's control centre as he looked around to find the reason for an unbearable stench emanating in the area. Inspector (crime) Kisan Gaikwad of Vashi police station said, "Around 11 am, a watchman spotted the trunk. The 3-foot-long metal trunk was heavy and there were some red stains that seemed to be blood, so he informed others at the centre and the police was summoned. A woman's decomposed body found stuffed inside the trunk."
 
 Senior inspector Ajay Landge said that the body might have been dumped about 48 hours ago as it was completely decomposed. "A civic doctor has stated that the woman has been strangled using a saffron coloured scarf, which was found intact round her neck. The trunk was also stuffed with several clothes of a woman and also of a man, besides a bedsheet and a towel. The crime investigation van and finger print experts have collected samples from the crime scene."
 
 The Vashi police have registered an FIR under IPC section 302 (punishment for murder) and section 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence) against unidentified persons.
 
 DCP (Crime) Tushar Doshi said, "The crime branch team is conducting a parallel probe in the woman's murder case. As a black apron has been found in the trunk, it seems like the woman was engaged in a house-keeping job, may be at a hospital."
