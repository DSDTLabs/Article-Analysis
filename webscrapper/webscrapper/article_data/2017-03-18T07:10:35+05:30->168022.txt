JAIPUR: Construction work of ambitious   project, proposed between Ambedkar Circle and Sodala, is affected due to delay in shifting of electric cables.

  (JDA) officials are finding it an uphill task to carry out piling work for construction as electric cables are haphazardly laid beneath the surface. 
 
 A JDA official said that out of 548 piles for foundation of columns for elevated road, only 70 piles had been completed so far.
 
 “Chambal power house falls on the route and a large number of electric cables are laid in the area. Also, VIP area like Civil Lines falls along the project. JDA cannot dig blatantly as it could interrupt power supply. The work would move at a snail’s pace till electric cables are shifted,” said a JDA engineer.
 
 It was informed that   (JVVNL) has given an estimate of Rs 4.5 crore, which will be borne by JDA. Sources in the JDA said the matter has been forwarded to JDA’s electrical wing. However, there is a delay due to infighting between JDA’s electrical and project wing. “There is no correspondence between JDA electrical wing and JVVNL. The reason for delay is electrical wing’s claim to take up the project,” a source said.
 
 As per proposal, it will take nearly 30 months to complete the project. After completing load testing, work for city’s second elevated road started in December 2016.
 
 Once completed, the road is expected to save nearly 40 minutes of travel time and will decongest Hawa Sadak as it would offer a non-stop drive at a speed of up to 50 km/h. Length of the elevated road from Ambedkar Circle to Sodala will be 2.8km. One wing of the project will branch out at   on Hawa Sadak to connect with areas like Swej Farm and Shyam Nagar.
 
 Length of the elevated road project, starting from Sodala side and descending towards Ambedkar Circle, will be 1.8km.
