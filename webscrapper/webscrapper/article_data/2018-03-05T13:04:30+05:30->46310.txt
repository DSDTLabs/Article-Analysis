MADURAI: The   movements (TAFALIM), has condemned state minister   for his comments in regard to closure of Tasmac shops. 

 While speaking at the meeting organised to distribute Amma two-wheelers in Dindigul on Saturday, he said that he was often confronted by women, who say that Tasmac was the cause for all their family problems. “Let me tell you that if not for Tasmac shops, many men will die due to consumption of illicit liquor. The problem will persist until the person himself decides to stop drinking,” Dindigul C Srinivasan said.
 
 Convenor of TAFALIM C   said that the minister’s speech was highly condemnable. “They should realise that one of the reason for the government’s bad performance was that they depended on sales of Tasmac shops to run the government,” he said.
 
 By promoting liquor, the minister had shown that they are not committed to keeping their poll promise on total prohibition, he said. “Recently the government had announced that it had set aside Rs 3 crore to create awareness on the ill-effects of liquor and here a minister was speaking about the better aspects of Tasmac,” he added.
 
 This not something that should be spoken about in meeting which had a predominantly female audience, said  , an activist from Karur, who also strongly condemned his comments. Ministers and public personalities, and people’s representatives should know that women are much more aware and that such statements would only go against the government, she said.
