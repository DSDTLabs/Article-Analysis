COIMBATORE: A 52-year-old man was on Friday booked under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on Friday for molesting a four-and-a-half year-old girl at   village near   on the outskirts of the city on March 6.

 A team of police led by Perur all-woman police station inspector   has launched a manhunt for the elderly man.
 
 The accused has been identified as A  , a tailor from Kondaiyampalayam village near  , where he resides along with his son.
 
 On March 6 around 7pm, he molested the minor girl in an isolated place. The girl narrated the incident to her adopted mother, who met Nanjappan the very next day and questioned him. Nanjappan, however, threatened her with dire consequences.
 
 Meanwhile, the minor girl developed severe pain on March 10 and she was admitted to a private hospital at Selvapuram.
 
 One of the neighbours contacted 1098 (Child Line helpline) and informed about the sexual assault. Immediately, its staff approached the all-woman police, Perur, and the girl’s mother lodged a complaint with them. 
 
 Following this, the police registered a case against Nanjappan under Sections 7 and 8 of the POCSO Act. “The girl was adopted by the woman a few years ago,” a police officer said.
 
 Nanjappan, the official said, has switched off his mobile phone and gone into hiding to evade arrest. Further investigation is on.
