AURANGABAD: The   is eyeing special funds from the district planning and   (DPDC) to take up projects in   localities.

 Residents are bearing the brunt of lack of proper amenities like water scarcity, coupled with poor   and bad roads. Though the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) earmarked funds for these localities, it is unable to meet the demand.
 
 Deputy mayor highlighted the poor state of affairs in one of the minority communities — Shambhu Nagar — and has urged the civic administration to seek additional funds from the DPDC.
 
 Ghogre tabled a proposal on this before the general body meeting scheduled on May 20 as part of the agenda for the meeting. She has requested the civic administration to seek Rs 50 lakh for building a drainage line, Rs 30 lakh to lay an internal pipeline network for better water supply and Rs 30 lakh for building concrete roads in Shambhu Nagar. 
 
 “The state has allotted special funds for these localities that can be routed through the civic body. Considering the ground reality in the area, I will urge the mayor to forward the proposal and allow the civic body to approach the DPDC,” she said.
 
 Ghogre added that over 1,000 households in the locality come under the ‘gunthewari’ area, where the AMC is not supposed to spend its own funds to develop amenities.
 
 The civic body collects regularisation charges from the  , but the funds generated under the head is not enough for the purpose. “After the local MLA Sanjay Shirsat released discretionary funds for roads, the area has construction of roads on two stretches,” she said.
 
 Shambhu Nagar is one of many such localities in the city, where residents have no option but to buy water from private suppliers. “Most residents spend Rs 800-1,000 a month on water. Apart from this, there is no drainage line in the area and so sewage accumulates at various low-lying spots posing a big threat,” she said.
