AHMEDABAD : For Sushila Jadhav, 80, now a resident of Thaltej, it was a tearful moment on Sunday when scores of middle-aged men and women rushed to her, addressing her ‘Sushila kaki (aunty)’ at   premises.

 “It’s been over two decades when I had seen them as teens. I could not recognize many but they immediately came to me with affection as if these years in between never mattered. It’s the love that I might never dream of in my current locality,” said Jadhav, who had come with her son to the reunion organized by the former residents of   ni Pol near  . 
 
 Subhash Shah, one of the primary organizers of the event, said that circumstances including communal tension in 1993 motivated many families shift from Walled City to newly-developing areas such as Satellite, Vastrapur, Paldi,  , Vatva and Isanpur. But one thing connected them all - a Hanuman temple, locally known as Thesiya Hanuman.
 
 “Many kept visiting the temple even after so many years. This  , there was record turnout of around 750. It was then that the decision of a grand reunion was taken. About 280 families participated in the event. Majority of the members met their former neighbours after two decades. The turnout has inspired us to organize more such events in the future,” said Shah.
 
 Shah added that the plan is afoot to shift the temple to western city parts where majority of the former pol residents are now settled.
 
 Himanshu Shah, who left the pol 25 years ago to settle in Vasna, said that old memories flooded in when the former residents met each other. “A pol is not just a design of living, but an idea of community living which one cannot find even in swanky high-rises,” said Shah. “Multiple factors contributed to its decline but till we live, we will keep remembering the narrow lanes, broad otla (extended platform outside house), amalgamation of all castes and communities and above all, warmth of the residents,” he said.
