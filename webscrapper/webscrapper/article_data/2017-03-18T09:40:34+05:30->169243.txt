RANCHI:  , who registered his maiden Test century at the JSCA International Stadium against India on Friday, lauded  's mammoth effort which saw his captain remaining unbeaten on 178 after having batted for eight-and-a-half hours.

 "He lifts the team to another level because he makes the game look so easy," Maxwell said of Smith's knock. "We watch him play and everyone's in awe of the way he goes about it, he does it in such a different, unique way and he owns that. He doesn't care what people say about his technique. He knows he has his technique doubters, but when the bloke's got 19 Test tons and averages over 60, I don't think you can knock it too much," added Maxwell, who shared a 191-run partnership with Smith.
 
 "He's a very inspirational leader with the way he's gone about his career. He obviously had his doubters... When he came into the team he was a leg-spinning allrounder batting at No. 8 or 9. And what a turnaround he's had.
 
 "I know that's a long way off, but I'd love to be able to follow in his footsteps and change my career from where I started."
 
 Talking about his own hundred, Maxwell said, "It has been a long since my last Test in 2014. I am just happy to be to be back in the side and didn't want to waste this opportunity. In my last game in Dubai, I did not make it count, so every opportunity is vital for me."
 
 The emotional celebration with skipper Steven Smith after completing his ton told a tale of its own and Maxwell narrated the anxious moments he spent in anticipation of the century.
