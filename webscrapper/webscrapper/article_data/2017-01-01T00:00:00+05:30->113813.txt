 It isn’t just fashion designers who are embracing the ’80s. Make-up artists are retrieving the glamour girl look with big, fluffy curls, metallic eyeshadows and pop lips. The big trend? Draping – the contouring style of applying blush high along your cheekbones to get a sculpted look. 
 
 
 
 
 The severe side part is likely to reign supreme as a go-to hairstyle this year. Natural yet controlled hair was the look of choice at Dries Van Noten, Prada, Givenchy and Kenzo. The trick is neat male-inspired side parting and sleek, slick hair that’s smooth on the scalp. 
 
 
 
 
 Lips are about to get a complete makeover this year. Bold and experimental, two tone lips require both creativity and confidence. Whether it’s glossy or matte, pastel or bright, nude or glittery – play with different colours and textures. To keep it subtle yet fun, start with combinations like fushcia on the upper lip and a shade lighter on the lower lip, bright red on the upper lip and orange on the lower lip. Stay away from stark contrasts. 
 
 
 
 The ‘no make-up’ look isn’t new but it certainly had a moment in 2016 and will continue to top the   charts in  . While bare-faced beauties were seen pulling it off on the runway for Marni, Band of Outsiders, and Vera Wang, celebrities like Kim Kardashian-West are fashionably tackling the trend. Flaunt natural, healthy skin by using make-up only to cover blemishes. Give your face some subtle tweaks and a soft flush. 
 Complete with a dab of gloss.
 
 2017 will be a sparkly affair. After red glitter lips, how about sporting a death-by-chocolate or a silver shimmer pout?
