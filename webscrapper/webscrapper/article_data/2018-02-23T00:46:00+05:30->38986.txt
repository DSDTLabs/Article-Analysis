Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday set aside the proceedings of the Teachers Recruitment Board (TRB) dated February 9 cancelling the written examination for recruiting teachers to various disciplines in government polytechnic colleges in the state.

 Justice G R Swaminathan passed this order on a petition filed by one M Ilamathi from Sivaganga district.
 
 Before that, when the case came up for hearing, counsel for the TRB told the court that no irregularities took place in the examination and some occurred while evaluating the answer (OMR) sheets. Marks of about 200 candidates were varied. 
 
 Following it, the court said “The TRB itself says there was no irregularities in the examination so that there is no need to cancel the examination. The TRB can do revaluation of answer sheets and take action against the people whose marks were varied. Thus, the TRB proceedings is set aside.”
 
 The petitioner’s counsel had claimed that due to complaints from some quarters over valuation of the answer sheets, the TRB withdrew the results and published new results, in which there are no variations.
