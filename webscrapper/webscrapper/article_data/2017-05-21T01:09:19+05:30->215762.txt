JAIPUR: The   Dispute   ordered a private hospital to pay a   of Rs 30 lakh to the kin of patient who died after an operation. The commission also directed the hospital to pay Rs 21,000 as legal expenses to the petitioner.

 The commission order followed a complaint by   whose wife died after an operation at Apex Hospital in Malviya Nagar.
 
 The petitioner said his wife was admitted at the hospital with abdomen pain on June 8, 2007. His wife underwent an operation for pancreatectomy for suspected cancer of the lower-end of the common bile duct (CBD). The petitioner further alleged that the doctor, who conducted the operation, was not qualified to perform the operation and the hospital was not equipped for post-operative care.
 
 As a third ground of medical negligence, the petitioner alleged that the hospital had neglected the request for patient’s case history from the diagnostic centre to which the intestine specimen was sent.
 
 After the operation, the petitioner’s wife,  , developed serious complications and she was referred to another hospital where she died on July 7, 2007.
 
 The commission said the operation was performed without confirming malignancy. Even after the operation, the removed tissue was not sent for analysis. There was no evidence of tumour in the tissue removed, the commission said.
 
 When the malignancy was not confirmed, the suggestion for a repeat biopsy was ignored. A very complicated whipple procedure surgery was performed by a doctor who was not an oncologist. Dr  , who conducted the operation was only a general surgeon, it was pointed out. Besides, a gastroenterologist was not called at the time of operation.
 
 The hospital, where the operation was performed, was neither a recognized cancer centre nor equipped to take care of post-operative complications.
