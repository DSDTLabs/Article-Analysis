To improve the accuracy of the surveillance, the government has introduced the vehicles in the six cities.
 
 The high resolution speed dome cameras can rotate 360 degrees and capture movements at long distance. The policemen on board the vehicle monitor the captured movements on the screens. In case of any suspected movements, they can immediately alert the police. The storage capacity of the device is four terabytes.
 
 Capturing the crowd for   festival has been the first assignment for the new vehicle. The vehicle will be out on surveillance regularly, particularly in commercial areas.
 
 Prior to the new vehicle, Trichy city police had designed such a vehicle on their own with the provision to mount one speed dome camera. With that vehicle also in use, the new one has given a boost to police surveillance in the city.
