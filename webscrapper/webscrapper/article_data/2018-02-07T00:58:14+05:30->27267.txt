Salem: In a bid toprovide world-class cancer detection and treatment to the local people, Manipal Hospitals on Tuesday launched a multi-specialty tumour board.

 The board comprises chief of clinical services Dr A Rajasekar; surgical gastroenterologists Dr Karthikeyan, Dr K Sivakumar, Dr Gnanasankar; medical oncologist J Mayuraa Vaiduriam; radiation oncologist Dr P Kathirvel Kumaran; and gynaecologist M Narmadha.
 
 Puneet Mehta, unit head of Salem Manipal Hospitals, the hospital would offer an all-encompassing comprehensive cancer care ranging from screening, evaluation, diagnosis, oncology consultations, surgical oncology, chemotherapy and radiation.
 
 “This will be the only hospital in Salem to have a world-class cancer treatment facility at an affordable price,” he said.
 
 It is unfortunate that ignorance and denial often leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment of cancer, Rajasekar said. “Early detection and treatment is key, besides making simple lifestyle changes,” he said.
