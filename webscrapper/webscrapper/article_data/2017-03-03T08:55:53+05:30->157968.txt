PATNA:   MLAs disrupted the   proceedings for the second consecutive day on Thursday in protest against the state minister Abdul Jalil Mastan’s reported call to people to beat PM Narendra Modi’s photograph with shoes.

 An NDA delegation comprising Sushil Kumar Modi and Prem Kumar (BJP), former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM-S), Lalan Paswan (RLSP) and Nutan Singh (LJP), also called on governor   and demanded dismissal of Mastan from the cabinet.
 
 Leader of opposition in the assembly Prem Kumar recalled that Mastan called PM Modi a “Naxalite, dacoit and extremist” while addressing a public meeting on ‘notebandi’ in his assembly constituency, Amour in Purnia district, on February 22. At Mastan’s call, his supporters also assaulted a picture of the PM with shoes and slippers.
 
 Former deputy CM Modi had on Wednesday alleged Mastan had deliberately resorted to the dirty propaganda with a view to polarising Muslim voters in favour of his Congress in UP elections. When pointed out that such a polarisation would in fact help the BJP, SuMo just smiled.
 
 On Thursday, deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav described the NDA protests over the remarks of Mastan as “just a drama. “Let the UP elections be over, the curtain will fall on the BJP’s protests,” said Tejashwi, who is the son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad.
 
 Prem on Thursday accused Mastan of “disturbing social harmony” in the state by making such remarks. On Wednesday, Prem had called Mastan a “Bangladeshi” settled in Bihar.
