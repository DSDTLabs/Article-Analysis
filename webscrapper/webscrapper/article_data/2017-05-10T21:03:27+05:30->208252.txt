International pop sensation  , who is all set to perform at the D.Y.   in Navi Mumbai this evening, was welcomed by enthusiastic fans waiting outside the Kalina airport in Mumbai last night. 
 
 The organisers of the show are going out of their way to ensure that Bieberâ€™s visit is not marred by any security issues. With at least 45,000 fans expected at the venue in  , the Navi Mumbai police and traffic departments have chalked out elaborate security, emergency, disaster management and traffic regulation plans.
 
 
  
 The venue will be under extensive CCTV surveillance and drone cameras will be used for live feed, which will be monitored from the control room. 500 police personnel will be on duty along with few sniffer dogs. Additionally, the venue will be screened by the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad before the commencement of the event.
  
 Considering the large number of footfalls, a ground near the venue has been earmarked for parking and will accommodate up to 3,000 cars at a time. A shuttle service will also be provided from the parking lot to the venue. Twenty officers and 200 constables will also be deployed to manage traffic along with 100 volunteers.
