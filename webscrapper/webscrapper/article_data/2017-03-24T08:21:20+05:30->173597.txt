PUNE: The primary   in   did not issue any circular to commemorate martyrs’ day on Thursday after a recent goof-up by its former education officer Tanaji Ghadge 

 He had sent a circular in February about commemorating martyrs’ day on Valentine's Day (February 14). Martyrs’ day remembers the sacrifice of freedom fighters  , Rajguru and Sukhdev.
 
 Th e uproar over the circular led to the suspension of Ghadge. The ministry of education issued a statement that no circulars will be issued by any EOs and all communications will be given out by the education ministry’s secretary or the commissioner.
 
 Madargani Mujawar, deputy education officer,   Zilla Parishad, said, “There was a circular from the state government asking the Zilla Parishad to commemorate the day. We had a small programme. But the primary education department did not issue any circular to schools about the day.”
 
 A teacher from a Zilla Parishad school in Solapur said, “There was no official circular from the education department, but individual schools did commemorate the martyrs in some places. They garlanded the portraits and talked to students about their lives. But there was no formal ceremony.”
 
 The circular issued on February 8 had said, “On February 14, revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar were martyred and hence that day in all schools should be commemorated by remembering their lives and performing pooja of their statues.”
 
 The students were also told to bring their parents to school and show their gratitude by performing an aarti of their parents while they were supposed to respond by donating in cash or kind for the schools’ development.
