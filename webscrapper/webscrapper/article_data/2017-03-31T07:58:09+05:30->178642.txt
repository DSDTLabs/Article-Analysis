ROURKELA: Union tribal affairs minister Jual Oram, in a letter to chief minister  , drew his attention and requested his immediate intervention for the construction of Talcher-Bimalagarh railway line project. 

 Oram in his letter pointed out that due to delay in land acquisition, mainly in Sundargarh, Deogarh and Angul, the construction work of the much-awaited railway line project is not taking off. Oram in his letter requested the CM to give necessary direction to the collectors of these three districts to complete land acquisition on a priority basis.
 
 The Talcher-Bimlagarh railway line was conceptualised in the sixties. The proposed line is slated to link the mineral-rich areas of the state with the port city of Paradip. 
 
 The route will also be the shortest one connecting the steel city of Rourkela with Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. Although the project was officially cleared by the central government and reasonable amount of funds were sanctioned in phases, the work has been progressing at a snail's pace. 
 
 Providing details about requirement of the land in Angul district, Oram mentioned that 540 acres of private land, 206 acres of government land and 382 acres of forest land have been indentified to be acquired for construction of a 82.6-km railway track. 
 
 Similarly, in Deogarh, 190 acres of private land, 144 acres of government land and 88 acres of forest land have been earmarked to be acquired for construction of a 30-km railway track for the project.
 
 In Sundargarh district, 253 acres of private land, 140 acres of government land and 100 acres of forest land have been identified to be acquired for construction of a 41-km railway track.
