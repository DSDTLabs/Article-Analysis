CHANDIGARH: To ease out the burden of courts, the   government on Friday approved the Haryana Urban Tenancy Act, 2018 to resolve the growing number of tenant-owner disputes. The Act has been notified.

 Haryana urban local bodies minister   said the earlier Act, formulated 45 years ago, was not equipped to resolve the growing disputes between the landlords and tenants in the cities. Besides, a rent   or tribunal would also be set up to help resolve such issues, she added.
 
 Due to the increasing population, the number of those opting for rental accommodation in cities is increasing by the day, she said, adding, the related Acts have not been amended which has resulted in increase in conflicts.
 
 “With introduction of this new Act, rights and responsibilities have been fixed for both the tenants and landlords, which would ensure quick resolution of the disputes and reduction in the number of cases in the courts,” she said.
