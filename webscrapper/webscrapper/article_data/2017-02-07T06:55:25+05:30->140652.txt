THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a video conference with top police officers here on Monday,   said the police should ensure that legislations like Kerala Anti-social Activities Prevention Act ( ) and Unlawful Activities Prevention Act ( ) were not misuse.

 He said that there was a trend, during the tenure of the previous government, of slapping the provisions of such laws on political opponents. The Acts like UAPA are only to be used in very special situations but there have been instances when the law was used in other cases also, he added.
 
 He said that the police should take action irrespective of political affiliation and while dealing with political leaders, the police should act independently. The chief minister said that the governmentâ€™s policy is that there should not be third degree measures used in lock ups. But still instances of lock up torture are being reported. He said that the government will take strict action if such instances come to the notice of the government.
 
 Vijayan said that special care should be taken for not giving the impression that the police were for or against any particular section. He asked the police to take zero tolerance against any attempts to create communal tensions.
 
 The government policy is to give utmost importance to the safety of women and any attack against women should be strongly dealt. At the same time, cyber-crimes are also on the rise and this should also be taken up seriously, Vijayan said.
 
 The chief minister analysed the functioning of police in various districts. He asked the superintendents of police to improve the effectiveness of periodical police station inspections in some of the districts.
 
 At the police headquarters, the conference was attended by additional chief secretary (home and vigilance)  , state police chief  , ADGPs of north and south zones, range IGs and other top officers.
