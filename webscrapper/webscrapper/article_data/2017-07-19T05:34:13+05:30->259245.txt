NEW DELHI:   joined the   in criticising   for his petition seeking clemency for terror convict   even as the opposition candidate for the vice-president’s post justified his stand, saying capital punishment belonged to the “medieval ages”.

 Shiv Sena was the first to raise the issue as Gandhi had written to President   in July 2015 to “reconsider” the rejection of Memon's mercy plea. The President had rejected the petition and Memon was later hanged. BJP joined its ally on Tuesday with general secretary   questioning Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik’s decision to support the UPA’s vicepresidential nominee.
 
 “It is ironic that Patnaik has supported a person who had sought mercy for a terrorist,” Singh said.
 
 Gandhi said, “I feel that death penalty and capital punishment belong to the medieval ages. Death penalty is wrong and this is my principle.”
