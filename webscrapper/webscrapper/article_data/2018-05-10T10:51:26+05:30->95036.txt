PANCHKULA: Around 12   and lab assistants were injured after police took to lathicharge and used water cannons on them outside  , Sector 5, on Wednesday. The incident took place when they were protesting against   government for not keeping various promises made to them.

 Around 200 computer teachers and lab assistants gathered at the entrance of Shiksha Sadan on Wednesday morning raising slogans against the government and said they had been promised that they will be provided various benefits including hike in salary, health benefits among others, but nothing has been done so far.
 
 When the protesters reached Shiksha Sadan, cops stopped them by barricading their way. As the protesters tried to remove the barricades, cops used water cannons and took to lathicharge to stop them. Around 12 protesters needed medication soon after the protest as they faced difficulty in seeing and hearing after being hit by water cannons.
 
 Balram, president of the computer teachers’ association,  , said, “Government is not fulfilling our demands which they promised to us long back. Now, they have lathicharged and used water cannons on us. This is shameful for a government to act like this.”
 
 Suresh Nain, a member of the association, said, “Around 12 protesters got injured in the protest and had to be sent to hospital for treatment. Such a behaviour was not expected from the government. We are just asking for the promises they made to us.”
 
 In 2017 too, the computer teachers and lab assistants were stopped by using water cannons and lathicharge by the cops while staging protest. Many were injured during that protest as well.
