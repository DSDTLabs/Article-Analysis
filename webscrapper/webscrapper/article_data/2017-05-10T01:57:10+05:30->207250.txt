NOIDA: Residents of Sector 28 had no water for a day as supply got disrupted because of the laying of new water pipes in the area. Water supply resumed by Tuesday evening.

 “Water supply stopped suddenly at 7.30pm on Monday without prior warning, and there was no supply on Tuesday morning as well. I called the water supply complaint number, but could not get any information,” said Brigadier (rtd) Ashok Hak, a resident of Sector 28.
 
 When contacted, Jal (II) project engineer   said: “We have been laying a new pipeline for Ganga water supply in Sector 28. We are also simultaneously continuing supply through the old pipes to ensure there is no inconvenience to the residents. The problem was a result of some fault in the pipeline, which was fixed by evening.”
 
 Work relating to the laying of the new water pipeline has commenced in several areas of the city, including sectors 12, 19 and 24. These are mostly old residential sectors of the city, where residents have repeatedly complained about old and rusted water pipes.
