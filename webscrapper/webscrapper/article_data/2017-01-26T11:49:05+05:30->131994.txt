LUCKNOW: Indian stars   and   made contrasting starts on the opening day of the   tournament on Wednesday . While Sindhu simply brushed aside the challenge of   21-9, 21-11, it was two different Srikanths at the BBD Academy. 

 He first overcame a sloppy start to tame youngster Lakhanee Sarang 15-21, 21-7, 21-14 in the morning, but was in his element later in the evening as he literally toy with Zulhelmi Zulkiffli to win 21-5, 21-12. Sindhu had everything going her way with her all-round game. The Rio Olympics silver-medalist didn't have to break much sweat as her dreaded smashes and measured drops kept Prabhudesai guessing all through the 21-minute encounter.
 
 A lot of Indian hopes now ride on Sindhu after the withdrawal of Saina Nehwal, and she didn't disappoint on Wednesday . She had all flanks covered against Prabhudesai. She now plays Lalita Dahiya in the pre-quarterfinals on Thursday . Dahiya downed Hadia Hosny 21-6, 20-22, 21-13 in the opening round.
 
 Another Indian hopeful HS Prannoy had a smooth sailing against compatriot NVS Vijetha. Pulling out all stops, he had Vijetha on the run to romp home 21-11, 21-9.
