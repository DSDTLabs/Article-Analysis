Visakhapatnam: As per the instructions of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation commissioner M Hari Narayanan, GVMC officials and staff took out awareness rallies on Saturday on vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue and preventive measures that should be taken to tackle the menace of mosquitoes.

 In Zone-I of the city, the students of the Chandrampalem High School were given a demonstration on the growth of larvae in stagnant water in places such as coconut shells.
