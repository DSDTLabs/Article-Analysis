The accused were booked under Sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code.

 Cops said   (TSBIE) authorities are now mulling over filing a case against the college under the   Act.
 
 Earlier this week, students from Sri Vasavi Junior College staged a protest aga inst the college management for not receiving their hall ticket to appear for the intermediate examination, which commenced on March 1. Investigations revealed that the fiasco was the result of the college management's failure to pay examination fee to the TSBIE, in spite of collecting the same from students.The college was, therefore, denied affiliation.
 
 He also said that the accused, with the malicious intent of making money, hid the facts from the students and collected an examination fee.“Since it was not recognised by the TSBIE, there were no hall tickets given to students,“ said Murali Krishna, inspector, Vanasthalipuram police station.
