CHANDIGARH: Punjab witnessed 2.6%   (TB) cases between 2015 and 2017. Officials said more cases are coming out due to increased awareness and availability of advanced diagnostics.

With this, we will soon be able to detect missing cases,” said Dr  , state TB officer.
 
 Punjab shall also focus on under nutrition which is strongly connected to the disease.
 
 “Poor hygiene and malnutrition are major risk factors for the latent TB bacteria to become active and spread. We will also use the application, N-TB, that has been recently endorsed by the WHO India to monitor the level of nutrition in these patients,” said Dr Naresh.
 
 All health workers will be able to use this app which is developed in collaboration with McGill International TB Centre, Montreal, to assess and monitor the diet of the TB patients.
 
 “It enables the classification of the nutritional status of the patient by calculating the body mass index (BMI). The app also provides counselling tips on diet with an emphasis on the value of locally available foods in contrast to costly nutritional supplements, activity and lifestyle,” said Dr  , Center for Nutrition Studies, Yenepoya University, Mangalore.
