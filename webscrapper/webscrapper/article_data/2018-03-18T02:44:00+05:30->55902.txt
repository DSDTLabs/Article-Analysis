Vijayawada: An all out war has begun between the   and   in the city after their alliance came to an end. Not only the leaders trading barbs, party workers are also indulging in verbal assaults against their former ally. 

 Banners lashing the BJP over injustice meted out to Andhra Pradesh surfaced again in Vijayawada within two days after the alliance came to a bitter end. TDP leader Katragadda Babu had put up banners criticizing the BJP even before the ties were snapped. However, chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu was forced to intervene in the matter as BJP leaders took serious objections to the banners. Naidu had then asked party workers to remove the banners.
 
 In the following days, Naidu had reprimanded his cadre for their aggressive campaign against the BJP. However, now the battle lines have been drawn. 
 
 Posters targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi have surfaced in the city, this time with harsher captions. Katragadda Babu, who had faced the ire from CM Naidu earlier, has now put up banners lashing out at the BJP and Modi. Speaking to TOI, Katragadda Babu said the banners are to send a tell the people about the injustice done by the BJP.
 
 A war of words has also ensued on social media platforms. Followers of both parties are engaged in bitter exchange of allegations. With political dynamics fast changing, both parties are not in a mood to relent.
 
 While the TDP supporters are putting up posts blaming the BJP for not granting special category status to the state, BJP supporters are alleging that the TDP is involved in corruption. 
 
 With Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan also going on an offensive against the TDP, social media platforms are abuzz with endless arguments.
