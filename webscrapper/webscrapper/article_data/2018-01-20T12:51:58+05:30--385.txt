Panaji: In alleged violation of the coastal regulations zone (CRZ) notification, 2011, and other rules, two persons have cleared a patch of mangroves and have begun construction of retaining walls around a property close to   river.

 The two persons, residents of   and  , had sought permission from Aldona panchayat for a temporary fencing and structure, both in property under survey no. 17/5 at Corjuem.
 
 In a letter dated November 30, 2017, the panchayat had conveyed to the parties that their application had been unanimously decided by the panchayat at its meeting on September 14, 2017.
 
 But, the parties allegedly brought laterite stones to the riverside site in mid-December last year, to start work on a compound wall in violation of CRZ norms.
 
 Dr  , in his complaint to Aldona panchayat, stated that he had proprietary rights in this property and that the illegal work should be stopped.
 
 The panchayat issued a stop work and inspection notice on January 5 to the parties, and directed them to furnish documents to prove its legality and attend an inspection on January 9.
 
 However, the parties did not halt the work even after the stop work order and the construction of a wall on three sides off the river and a structure continued.
 
 The panchayat inspected the site on January 9 and the report is yet to be submitted.
 
 Rangel has also complained to the   (GCZMA) on January 11, alleging violation of CRZ laws and illegal conversion of land for construction.
 
 “The matter is being processed,” a coastal authority source said.
