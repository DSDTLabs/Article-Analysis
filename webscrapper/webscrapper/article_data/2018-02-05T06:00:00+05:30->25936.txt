Cries of “Band karo Band Karo, Fee zulum band karo,” resonated at People’s Plaza, Necklace Road when 50-odd parents gathered on Saturday to demand Central Fee Regulatory Ac to stop school authorities from hiking fees 
indiscriminately. The Hyderabad Schools Parents’ Association (HSPA) that held the protest rally also sent a letter in this regard to  , Central Minister of Human Resource Development, with support of other parents associations from across 18 states. Citing the the recent incident in which a 14-year-old girl,   from Jyoti High School, Malkajgiri committed suicide after being barred from sitting in a written exam by her teachers following non-payment of fees, Seema Aggarwal, a parent and member of HSPA said, “Every year, many students of   take their life after being subjected to humiliation due to non-payment of fees. We have to eradicate this menace once and for all.”  , another parent, said, “This is the third such incident in Telangana in the last few years, child rights activists inform that they get a complaint every 48 hours in this regard. Schools now have ‘fees officers’ who oversee if a student has paid his/her fees on time or not; this is the state of education in the city.” 
 
 More than the exorbitant school fees, it is the mistreatment of the students by the management which is a matter of grave concern. “Students should not be involved in the fee transaction process. Ideally, the matter should be handled between the management and the parents. Often this greediness of the school management leads to humiliation of the students pushing them to take such extreme steps,” said Ravindra Tejaswi, a member of the organisation.
