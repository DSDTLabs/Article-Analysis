A US-based company has developed a smart bed that can adjust itself in order to stop you from   and provide maximum comfort for a sound sleep. The smart bed was unveiled by Sleep Number at the CES trade show in Las Vegas.

 The technology at work adjusts the bed's comfort in real time via the two   inside a   -gently contouring to each partner's side, back or stomach profiles.
 
 It is also equipped with an automatic snore detection and adjustment. The adjustable base automatically adjusts to each   throughout the night. For example, if someone is snoring on their back, the base automatically raises their head seven degrees to help temporarily relieve the symptoms of common, mild snoring in otherwise healthy adults. The mattress also knows the user's bedtime routine and warms the foot of the bed automatically . An alarm feature wakes people up when they are in the lightest stage of sleep during their desired wake-up time window. The bed was named the CES Innovation Awards' `Best of Innovation' honoree in the `home appliances' category.
