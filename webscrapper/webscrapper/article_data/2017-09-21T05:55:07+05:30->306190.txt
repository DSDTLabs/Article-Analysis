KOLKATA: To ensure that the surrounding areas of the Salt Lake stadium — that is set to host the   in October, looks clean and green — the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) evicted the makeshift food stalls that were encroaching the pavements.

 The civic authority has also formed a committee to ensure that the enchroachers do not return to set up a stall within a few kilometres radius of the stadium, including IA, GD and IB blocks. 
 
 BMC mayor Sabyasachi Dutta said that no new encroachments will be allowed on the pavements anywhere in the township. However, the civic officials said the stalls that were recently evicted may return after the World Cup. However, they will not be allowed to use bamboo and plastic sheets to make the stalls. “We are keeping a close watch to ensure that those evicted do not return, at least till the World Cup ends,” said a civic official.
 
 “We welcome the BMC’s move to clear the encroachments. This will help in develop the township,” said Bidhannagar Welfare Association secretary Kumar Shankar Sadhu.
 
 Though the stall owners cleared the pavements, they complained that the civic authorities have not informed them if they would get rehabilitated elsewhere. “The earnings from the stalls fetched our daily bread and butter. The civic authorities have not told us what to do now,” said Pankaj Debnath, who had a magazine stall in front of IA market.
 
 “We don’t know what future holds for us,” said a fruit seller, who had a stall at IA block.
