Looks like there is no end to the standoff between   and digital service providers, the strike that began a month ago is going on steadily and the industry has already lost huge revenue due to the shutdown. The latest news is that there is a new chapter to the strike, reports says the   producers have decided to lend their support to TFPC.

 There have been reports claiming that the Telugu film Industry won’t release any new film in   from April 8 (Sunday) and that producers have also decided to stall the screening of   and Samantha’s ‘Rangasthalam’, which has been doing extremely well at the box office. This could be a huge blow to the theatre owners who were happy with the profit they were receiving through the blockbuster film. However, there has been no official confirmation from the Tollywood producers and online ticket booking sites have bookings open for the dates following April 8.
