CHENNAI: August's unexpected showers have given Chennai's four reservoirs enough water to meet the city's requirements for an additional 15 days -a much-needed bonus for residents facing a severe water shortage this year.

 The reservoirs in Chembaramabakkam, Poondi,   and Cholavaram reservoirs, the city's primary water sources, ran dry in July, forcing   to find alternate sources.
 
 A Metrowater official said supply from the reservoirs will begin soon.
 
 “Further rainfall is expected this month. We will wait a while before we draw from all four reservoirs,“ he added.
 
 The state last month recorded its highest rainfall for August in 50 years. Poondi, Red Hills and Cholavaram reservoirs are in Tiruvallur district, which received 45cm of rainfall, 24% above normal, since June. Kanchipuram district, in which Chembaramabakkam reservoir is located, recorded 14% excess rainfall. The combined level of the four reservoirs had fallen below 1% of a total capacity of 11,000 million cubic feet (tmcft) in July. On Friday, the combined level was 0.4tmcft, nearly 4% of capacity. The reservoirs contained 2.1tmcft at the same time last year.
 
 The city is unlikely to receive Krishna water supply from Andhra Pradesh in the coming months. “For AP to supply Krishna water, the   reservoir [which stores Krishna water] water level should be in excess of 13tmcft,“ an official said.
 
 The current level of the Kandaleru reservoir is 3.6TMC. AP gets 66% of its annual rainfall between June and September and 24% from October to December.
 
 The levels of the city's reservoirs, however, are likely to rise rapidly from October, when the northeast monsoon sets in.
