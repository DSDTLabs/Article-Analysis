 Sirajuddin was asked to clear at least one   to get back his auto. He immediately paid fine for one challan and got the receipt. After paying for one challan, the traffic cops insisted that he also clear the remaining fine of Rs 600. Later the cops shifted his seized auto to traffic police station.
 
 After several requests proved futile, Sirajuddin climbed the scaffolding and threatened to jump while demanding his auto to be returned. As the auto driver was shouting, several onlookers gathered at the Machli Kaman and the flow of traffic was stopped for few hours. In wake of ongoing Charminar pedestrianisation project work, the police have already enforced traffic diversions in and around the historic structure.
 
 After a lot of persuasion, the police with the help of a local corporator succeeded to convince Sirajuddin to come down from the scaffolding. He was immediately taken into custody and shifted to  , where he was counselled by police officials, before allowing him to leave with his auto.
