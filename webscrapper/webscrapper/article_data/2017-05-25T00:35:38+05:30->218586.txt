MUMBAI: Sahar police on Monday arrested a man employed in a Dubai-based bank for allegedly travelling from Dubai to Mumbai on a fake Indian passport. Delhi-resident Sachin Verma (35) committed the offence after his employer in Dubai claimed to have lost his   and he was left with no choice other than getting a fake one to fly back home.

 Verma was caught at the Mumbai’s   (CSIA) on Monday night. “The immigration officials got suspicious while scanning Verma’s passport. While the photo on the passport was genuine, the details did not match. The passport was issued to some other person,” said a police officer.
 
 “Recently Verma decided to change his job and informed his employer to return his passport. When the employer informed him that they have lost his passport, Verma got in touch with an agent who got him a passport after charging a hefty sum,” said the investigators.
 
 Verma, police said, had probably not registered himself with the Indian consular after landing in Dubai for the job last year, else such incident could have been avoided. “The agent has pasted Verma’s photo on the passport with a different name. When the immigration officials checked they found different photo in the record,” said the investigators.
 
  spokesperson, DCP Rashmi Karandikar confirmed the arrest. She said Verma has been booked under various sections under the Indian Penal Code. He is in police custody till May 25.
