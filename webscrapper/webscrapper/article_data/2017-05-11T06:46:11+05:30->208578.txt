BENGALURU: Tech Mahindra is set to let go of about 1,500 employees, or close to 1.2% of its workforce, following in the footsteps of bigger rivals such as Infosys,   and Cognizant, all of which are in the process of doing big layoffs as protectionist policies in the US and new technologies shake up the $150-billion Indian IT sector.

 Tech Mahindra, the country’s fifth largest IT services provider, had 117,095 employees across 90 countries till the third quarter, which ended December 31. The company, which will announce its fourth quarter results this month, has a majority of its employees in India.
 
 It was not immediately clear which job levels would be impacted as a result of the redundancies, whether the layoffs are part of the normal appraisal cycle or if the severity has been accentuated by the slowdown in the sector. “We have a process of weeding out bottom performers every year and this year is no different,” a Tech Mahindra spokesperson said in an emailed response to TOI.
 
 The move mirrors that of the larger IT service  , which are in the process of culling workforce on a scale not seen since the recession between 2008 and 2010. Cognizant is expected to reduce its workforce by about 6,000, and Infosys by about 1,000 in job level 6 and above (group project managers, project managers, senior architects and higher levels). Wipro too is said to have been harsher in its annual appraisals this year, and the CEO is said to have indicated a 10% cut in employee strength if the company’s performance does not improve.
 
 Most companies reported numbers last year that were below market expectations, and the forecast for this fiscal isn’t any better than last year.
