When   invited its ex-student   to address the current batch at the ' ', he refused to give a lecture. He instead said, “Main apne baare mein kuch nahin bol paunga, aap sawal puchiyega toh main jawab de dunga.” So the NSD director, Waman Kendre, told the audience on Sunday, “There are no set questions, so we all are going to fumble a little.”

 The interaction started with the teachers asking him ‘zara uss struggle ki kahani suna do’, and ‘zara yeh bata do’, but the questions from the students ranged from serious professional advice to some informal candid questions, the replies to which resulted in guffaws from the stage and the lawn alike.
 In response to a question whether his sense of romance is how it was shown in  , Nawaz shared a similar incident from his college days. “It (the scene) was from my personal experience. When I was in second year, I asked a junior to go to a garden with me. We were sitting, and then I put my hand on her hand to which she sternly asked me, ‘What are you doing?’ And I simply said, ‘Touching your hand’. To which she replied, ‘This is illegal’. I forgot everything after that, and started imagining myself in jail!”

 When a girl from the audience said, “Aapko itne paas se dekhna is like a dream come true,” Nawaz cheekily replied, “Nahin abhi bhi aap kaafi door hain mujhse!"
 
 Another student asked him how long his struggle in the film industry was, and Nawaz said, “Bas 1996 mein gaya tha yahan (NSD) se, aur ab 2017 hai. Toh gin lijiye. Maine apne aapko 25 saal ka waqt diya tha industry mein establish hone ke liye.”
