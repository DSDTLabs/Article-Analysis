CHENNAI: In a space of three weeks, Tamil Nadu has lost one temple elephant and the Madras high court has allowed the euthanasia of another, bringing under the scanner the maintenance of jumbos at temples under the control of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) department. 

 While 30-year-old Rukku of the famed   at   was laid to rest on March 22 after sustaining injuries when it was taken out for a regular walk, the ailing Rajeshwari of   in Salem lost one of its tusks when it fell from an earthmover during an attempt to lift it at the temple last month. 
 
 S   of the Salem-based Wildlife and  , an  , charged that elephants are not well maintained in many temples. "The maintenance of elephants at most temples and religious institutions is appalling. They do not live in the right environment for them to thrive," he said.
 
 The state government introduced the Tamil Nadu Captive Elephants (Management and Maintenance) Rules, 2011, setting norms for the welfare of elephants, particularly those in temples. This apart, the state government has also been conducting an annual camp for the rejuvenation of temple elephants for about 15 years. About 34 elephants are in HR and CE temples, while temples under the purview of 56 mutts also have elephants.
 
 Sharavanan claimed that many of the norms are not being followed. "It is good that the mahouts and their assistants (cavady) are also provided training during the annual camp. But this is of little use because the higher officials, who are in charge of temple administration, do not understand the issues raised by the mahouts for the wellbeing of the elephants," he said.
 
 When contacted, officials from the HR and CE department said all efforts are being taken for the maintenance of elephants in temples. "Funds have never been a constraint for the welfare of elephants at temples, which are worshipped by devotees as Lord Ganesha," an official added.
