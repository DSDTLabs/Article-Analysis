MUMBAI: Police solved a fake case of   and   registered by a class IX student on March 10. The 14-year-old boy from a Vile Parle school planned his kidnap after learning that his teacher had called his parents as he bunked school. The case was solved in less than 24 hours after police scanned CCTV footage and questioned pavement dwellers. He planned the offence after watching a crime detective serial on TV.

 The boy planned the drama on March 9 to escape from punishment at school and his parents. “The boy complained that he was scared to go to school after he was kidnapped and sexually assaulted on March 3 while on his way to school in the morning. The kidnappers, after assaulting him, left him near Pawan Hans in Juhu an hour later,” said a police officer of Santacruz police station. 
 
 The boy claimed four men kidnapped him in a black i20 car, 30 metres from his school gate. They covered his face and sexually assaulted him after taking him on a spin for almost an hour, he had said. A fruit vendor from the spot said he did not notice any such incident and CCTV footage drew a blank, police said.
 
 Later the boy broke down and confessed that he faked it. 
 
 DCP (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said they were planning to file a ‘B’ summary in the case (finding the case false).
