National Award-winning director   is known for making films that offer a mix of realism, relatability and entertainment. Interestingly, he had recently said that his upcoming film, 'October', will mark Varun Dhawan’s debut of sorts, as it has the actor in a never-seen-before avatar. The movie also stars debutante  . 

 Shoojit’s words have rung true, because ever since the trailer of 'October' released, Varun has offered glimpses of his impressive performance in it. However, it seems, perfecting the part was not easy for the young actor, who had to religiously follow the 10 commandments by his director. Wondering what they are? Read on...
 
 
 On waking up, Varun had to look at plants and not his phone. He did this for a year to imbibe calmness.
  
 He had to be off social media while shooting.
 
 The actor was asked to make a conscious effort to lower his volume and talk softly to everyone.
 
 Varun was asked not to re-read the entire script before performing a scene. He had to focus on one scene at a time. 
 
  The role required him to look like a regular 21-year-old boy, for which he stopped gymming and started following a normal diet instead of the special one. 
 
 Shoojit believes that being honest to oneself reflects in everything one does. So, he asked his lead actor to do the same.
 
  Instead of walking with a hero’s swagger, the actor was asked to practise walking like a regular guy.
 
 Shoojit made sure that Varun wore less to no make-up in the film. 
 
 As Shoojit wanted Varun to pick up the mannerisms of a hotel employee, he was asked to perform all the tasks of a trainee — cooking, cleaning, laundry, 
 serving, etc. 
 
 Varun had to sacrifice his sleep for a few nights, as he was required to look sleep-deprived in some sequences.
