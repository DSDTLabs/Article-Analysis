GREATER NOIDA: Nearly two weeks after a Class X student was allegedly raped by a youth of the same village in  , the family members of the minor   alleged that they were being pressured by the accused’s family to reach a compromise in the case by accepting Rs 1.5 lakh as compensation.

 The girl was allegedly raped by a youth,   (19), on July 18 when she was alone at home.
 
 “I was sweeping the floor in the morning when Kapil entered the room and started misbehaving with me. He raped me and slapped my face repeatedly. Later he threatened me not to tell anyone about the incident,” the girl told mediapersons.
 
 “Later panchayats were held in the village in which the accused’s family asked us to reach a compromise for Rs 1.5 lakh. The police lodged a complaint only for outraging her modesty and refused to file a rape case,” said the mother of the accused.
 
 According to police, the girl had initially told her cousin that she was only assaulted but later told her mother that she was in fact raped.
 
 The girl's family met SSP, Gautam Budh Nagar, Love Kumar to complain against the family of the accused. 
 
 However, police said that after the girl recorded her statement before the magistrate under Section 164 of CrPC, the Dadri police has included Section 376 (rape) of IPC and relevant sections of the POCSO Act.
 
 “We included the sections in the FIR soon after her statement was recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC on Wednesday. The youth was arrested on Saturday and sent to jail,” SHO, Dadri, Ramsen Singh said.
