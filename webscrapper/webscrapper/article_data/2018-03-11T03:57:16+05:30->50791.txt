MUMBAI: A survey carried out in the two districts of   and Satara as part of a national study has thrown up a worrying fact—gender gap in   widens with age. This means the number of   dropping out of formal education system increases as they grow older.

 The survey, carried out by  , a not-for-profit organization that works in the education sector, focused on the 14-18 age bracket. The findings were included in the Economic Survey report released by the Maharashtra government on Thursday.
 
 The findings show that while the   gap is not huge in the age group of 14-16, by 18 years, fewer girl students remain enrolled in educational institutions than  . 
 
 In Satara, 18.1% girl students dropped out against 7% boys, by age 18; in Ahmednagar, 8.2% girl students left school against 5.8% boys.
 
 Farida Lambay, founder and trustee, Pratham, said for the survey, they decided to focus on the age group of 14-18 as it is a critical juncture for all students considering that choices available to them can shape their future. 
 
 Lambay said there were several reasons for the high dropout rate among girls. “Either the road to school or the area was not safe or the girls didn’t have any ambition due to the absence of any role models,” said Lambay. If a family has two kids, one male and one female, and can pay for only one’s education, they pick the boy. “The decision is not based on merit.”
 
 As many as 120 villages covering 1,900 households with 2,329 youth were studied for the survey, which also comments on the quality of education. It showed in Ahmednagar, merely 34% of the surveyed youth could divide using simple arithmetic and 26% solve subtraction sums, and in Satara, 39% and 25%, respectively. Lambay said the next step is to ensure kids understand the usability of knowledge and how to use it.
