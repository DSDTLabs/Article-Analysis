Mushairas and  , being one of the latest trends in Lucknow, usually get to witness a majority of male poets with only a handful of lady poets in attendance. However, to give the trend a twist, Aisha Ayub organised a mushaira titled Raushnaai – Bazm-e-Sukhan at Buddha Research Centre which had just women poets participating. A total of 11 ladies from all across India, shared their thoughts and feelings in the form of poetry with the audience and surprised many with their talent.
Aisha, while highlighting the reason for this initiative, shared, “It is said that women are more expressive than men, then why do we get to see the majority of males in the field of mushaira? In order to bring a change and prove that women are no less than their male counterparts, I organised this event. It took me around two months to gather 11 women poets, whom people don’t know much about but who are strong with their poetic skills for this event.” 
 Dr  , a professor and a writer anchored the event. Geetanjali Rai, a 28-year-old poet and an IT analyst, recited her poems Neem Ka Ped and Jaadugar, while Hina Rizvi, a housewife, presented the poems Binte Hawa Hun Main, Daamane Ulfat Se Nikalna Bhi Nahi Hai Mujhko, among others.
