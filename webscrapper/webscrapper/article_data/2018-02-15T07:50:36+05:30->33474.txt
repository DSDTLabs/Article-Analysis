CHANDIGARH: A seven-member committee of farmers’ unions from Punjab, Haryana,  , Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and   has announced to lay siege to the national capital New Delhi on February 23. The farm leaders have also elaborated on the action plan claiming that over 10,000 tractor-trailers from Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and UP would come out on roads.

 Addressing the media at Chandigarh on Wednesday, senior leaders of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)   and Suresh Koth said the farmers would use the national highways from all sides to reach New Delhi to press for their demands. “We are forced to take this step as none of the governments in the states and at the Centre have been able to address the problem of farmers. Today, farmers of Punjab are under a debt of over Rs 1 lakh crore while Haryana farmers may not be that bad but they are certainly under debt,” said Chaduni.
 
 He said their main concern was that the farmer be given their due. “While asking for higher   (MSP), Haryana, in its communication to Union government in 2014, had admitted that the input cost of wheat was Rs 2,100 per quintal. If they go by Swaminathan panel recommendations, the government should give us good MSP. If we get higher prices, we will not go on strike,” said Koth, the farmer leader from Hisar.
