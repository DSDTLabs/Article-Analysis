NEW DELHI: Metro commuters using the Violet Line faced a tough time on Tuesday due to the ongoing safety inspection of the upcoming ITO - Kashmere Gate stretch of the corridor.

 At present, train services are available between Escorts Mujesar (Faridabad) and ITO on the Violet Line. On Tuesday, however, trains terminated at   station due to the safety inspection, which caught commuters, bound for ITO, unaware.
 
 “In view of the confirmatory run of Commissioner for   (CMRS) between the ITO and Kashmere Gate section of Line 6, trains were being reversed back from   instead of ITO, which caused slight disturbance of train frequency on this section between 3.15 pm and 4 pm,” said a DMRC spokesperson.
 
 The two-day safety inspection of the 5.17 km long section by the CMRS began on Monday and following a safety go-ahead from CMRS, DMRC is expected to open the section for public very soon. The stretch will connect Kashmere Gate to Central Secretariat and further to Faridabad.
