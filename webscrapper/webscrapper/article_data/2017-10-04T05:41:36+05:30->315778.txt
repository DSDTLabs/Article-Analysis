MUMBAI: Distraught by the state's   for  , a group of students have moved the   demanding that qualified teachers be appointed.

 A PIL filed by representatives of a political party on behalf of students stated that several night schools in the city have been affected by the state's new guidelines that disallow school teaching or non-teaching staff employed during daytime to work in night schools. “We have only one Marathi language teacher for about 100 Class VIII, IX and X students. This teacher was assigned to us in July , almost two months into the academic year. We have only one peon left among the non-teaching staff. It is practically impossible to function like this. Students of Class X have lost out on crucial months,“ said Meenal Vagal, treasurer at Utkarsh Night School, Worli. 
 
 Chandrakant Mhatre, former principal at New Era Night School, Chembur, said several schools have been facing similar troubles. “While some schools have no teachers at all, at some schools there are untrained teachers.Those with merely a diploma in education cannot teach students of Class VIII onwards.The state has conducted baseline tests for night school students without teaching them for the last few months,“ he said.Mhatre cannot continue to hold his position at the night school since he works as a full-time teacher at a day school too. He also is planning to move the HC.
 
 Deputy director of education BB Chavan said the government has already made appointments. “We have made appointments at all aided schools. Appointments haven't been made at minority institutes because they have to be done by the management,“ he said.
