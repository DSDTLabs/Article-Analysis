PUNE: Maharashtra’s foodgrain production zoomed to a six-year high in 2016-17 on the back of a good monsoon last year.

 This year also marks the first time when the state’s foodgrain production crossed the 150-lakh tonne mark after 2010-11.
 
 According to the state agriculture department, the estimated foodgrain production in the state is set to rise by almost 80 per cent this fiscal compared to the last financial year.
 
 It was in 2010 when state’s foodgrain production reached a formidable 154 lakh tonne, after which there has been a slide. The state’s produce of kharif and   crops plummeted to 83 lakh tonne last fiscal (2015-16) when drought-like conditions prevailed in several parts of the country.
 
 Maharashtra's production of pulses is also likely to surpass the 14 lakh tonne recorded last fiscal to 33 lakh tonne this financial year -- almost a 50 per cent jump — the recently released estimates revealed.
 
 The production of pulses this year seems to be even better than 2010-11 when the state’s yield of pulses touched 31 lakh tonne. After 2010-11, Maharashtra could never really reach the 30-lakh tonne-mark in production of pulses until the current fiscal.
 
 A senior   official told TOI that the normal monsoon in 2016 came as a boon for foodgrain production in the state. “Like 2010-11, when the country received 102 per cent rainfall during monsoon, 2016 also witnessed a normal monsoon. The period between 2010 and 2016 witnessed erratic monsoons, which were either deficient or excess. Too less or too much rainfall is bad for crops. For instance, 2012, 2014 and 2015 were deficient monsoon years, while 2013 monsoon season had excess rainfall,” the official said.
 
 Another official said that the Rabi season in 2016 was quite good, when rabi sowing surpassed past records. “There was sufficient soil moisture available for farmers due to the preceding normal monsoon season last year,” he said.
 
  and   are major pulses growing regions in the state while south Maharashtra and Marathwada produce a bulk of the state’s jowar and bajra.
 
 Another state agriculture official said that deficient rainfall during 2016 had resulted in dry fields, posing problems for farmers during sowing.
 
 “In 2015, the rabi season suffered too due to lack of rainfall in October. Our recent estimates show that foodgrain production this fiscal may translate into record yield; however a clearer picture will emerge when the final production estimates are released in March this year,” he said.
