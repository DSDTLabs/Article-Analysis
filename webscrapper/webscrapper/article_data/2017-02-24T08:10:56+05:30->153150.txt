BENGALURU: The people of Karnataka have high expectations from chief minister Siddaramaiah’s budget, to be presented on March 15. Many feel as assembly polls are 15 months away, it could be a perfect backdrop for the government to present a dream budget to bail out sectors like farming and industry that have been hit hard by demonetization and drought. 

 Experts feel this budget will be a populist one, considering that it’s technically the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government’s last. TOI spoke to analysts and economists to get an idea of what they expect from his 12th budget.
 
 * With polls around the corner, the chief minister has no option but to be populist. Technically, it’s his last budget as CM because the next one will be a mere vote-on-account. The impact of demonetization will be more visible in this budget. It will be a challenge for the CM since he has to cushion the blow from demonetization on one side and offer populist schemes on the other to lure voters. The CM may focus on segments like rural, agriculture and continue to push for infrastructure development

 * In the backdrop of drought, tackling climate change has become imperative. But rarely has the subject been associated with the dry science of budgeting and fiscal policy. Increasing funding for both adaptation and mitigation is crucial to tackling climate change and for promoting low-carbon, climate-resilient development. However, while most of the focus so far has been on increasing the scale of budgetary allocation, less attention has been paid to capacity building, especially with regard to pollution and environment. The objective should be to assist institutions in strengthening their legal, technical, research, analytical, programme-implementation capacity, and ensure policies for effective governance through exchange of expert knowledge

 The CM is likely to focus on improving rural economy which is the need of the hour. The agriculture sector has been facing crisis owing to drought in the past two years, and demonetization has crippled it further. There’s a need to extend incentives to spur rural economy given that agriculture growth has slipped to 2 per cent. The CM might lay additional emphasis on rural development as the state is heading into an election year. It would be prudent to take steps to concentrate on rural governance too

 The focus should be on infrastructure outside Bengaluru, particularly in the north Karnataka region, to enable flourishing of micro-small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). This would ease pressure on infrastructure in Bengaluru and give an opportunity to MSMEs, both within and outside the city, to expand their operations and grow faster. The sales to SEZs should be exempt from VAT in lieu of the current refund route. The filing of appeals for assessments involving non-submission of statutory forms (Forms C, I, F and H) should be allowed without the requirement of 30% pre-deposit of the disputed taxes. This would enable the industry to mitigate the hassles arising out of cash block in the form of pre-deposits and facilitate smooth GST transition

 I expect the budget to be pro-farmer, pro-rural and   The farming sector has reasons to expect something big this year considering they are reeling under successive droughts and demonetization. Keeping an eye on the 2018 polls, Siddaramaiah is bound to give preferential treatment to Ahinda (Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes and dalits) communities to retain their support
