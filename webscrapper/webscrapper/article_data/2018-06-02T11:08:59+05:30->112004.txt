THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The city police on Friday arrested a 36-year-old man, who posed as the   human resources (HR) head of an international airlines company and swindled people. The police identified the accused as Shine   of Puthukkari Nettikkavila House, Chirayinkeezh. He went by alias names Dr   and Dr Shine Sathyapalan. 

 According to police, the accused was arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by one Kozhimalayil Jacob of Mavelikkara. He alleged in his complaint that Shine Sathyapalan contacted him as the South Asia HR Head of a prominent airline company and requested to hire his car on contract basis to be used for the operations of his office here. He even prepared a contract on a fake letterhead of union external affairs ministry to convince him. But later, the accused went absconding with the car. Since their deal had taken place in a house near Trivandrum International Airport, Koshi filed his complaint with   police on Thursday. The accused was arrested from the city on Friday by a team led by Valiyathura sub-inspector S Bijoy and shadow police sub-inspector A S  . The police also confiscated the car of the complainant and seized several credit/debit cards, bank passbooks and Aaadhaar cards in bogus addresses and fake letterheads.
 
 The police said that the accused was an MBA graduate and used his education to swindle people across the country. 
 
 He has similar cases in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh too besides in police stations in almost all districts in the state. He was out on bail in those cases. 
 
 "He was involved in a similar case in 2011 and this helped us to identify him and track him down quickly," said SI Sunil Lal.
