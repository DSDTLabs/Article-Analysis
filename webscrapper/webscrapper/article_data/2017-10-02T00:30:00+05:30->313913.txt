Mysuru: Miniature models of more than 22 aircraft whizzed past people’s heads, and the muted roar of their engines filled the sky at  , where an   show of radio-controlled (RC) aircraft was organised on Sunday.

 Hundreds of visitors, some of whom were at the helipad for the helicopter ride at the venue, watched fascinated as the   performed a series of manoeuvres. The RC pilots, many of whom were children, impressed the spectators with their skill and control over the models. Shivmithran, all of nine years, was the youngest participant, who showcased skills he had honed during a year’s rigorous training.
 
 For Alex Praveen, more accustomed to controlling an aeroplane from within the confines of a cockpit, flying an RC aircraft was a memorable experience. Praveen operated a model of a boomerang jet, which was on show for the first time, flying it at speeds of 200 to 300kmph. Praveen was delighted with the response to the aeromodelling show this year. “It’s good to see many youngsters coming forward to learn about aircraft models. Flying RC aircraft is tougher than flying a plane. In a cockpit, we can make corrections, but here, we need to take decisions very quickly,” he added.
 
 The aircraft models that were part of the show could travel at dizzying speeds of up to 300kmph, and could sustain the momentum for 10 to 20 minutes. Although they could fly to a distance of 1,800m, poor visibility forced the organisers to restrict the range to 600m. The price of these RC aircraft ranges anywhere between Rs 25,000 to Rs 2 lakh.
 
 Deputy commissioner D Randeep was among those in attendance at the show.
 
 Boomerang jet, turbine jet, Corvus Racer 540 were among the models at the show on Sunday.
