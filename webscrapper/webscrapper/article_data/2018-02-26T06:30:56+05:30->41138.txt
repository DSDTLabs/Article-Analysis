CHENNAI: Households in   are yet to get a sewerage system, a year after the counsel for the Avadi municipality told the Madras high court that 95% of the   (UGD) work was completed.

 Facing a delay for nearly a decade, residents are battling with a lack of a functional sewerage system, evasive replies from the municipality and complaints falling on deaf ears. Over 42,000 households spread across 48 wards are still awaiting connections, despite having paid connection and road cutting fees.
 
 The underground drainage system, work on which commenced in 2009, was to provide   for 3,400 streets, but residents say some streets were missed out. 
 
 Roy Rozario, a resident, said that while the municipality maintained that 95% of the work on the   is complete, members of the office said that over 20% of the work still remained.
 
 According to municipal officials, sewerage and distribution lines have been laid, work on manholes and lifting stations is over, and work on one of the two sewage treatment plants (STPs) is underway.
 
 “Around 90% of the work is over. Work on the 36MLD STP in Paruthipattu is being taken up. 45 wards will be connected to the STP after handing over the connection on a trial basis,” said C Mathivanan, commissioner. 
 
 According to an engineer in the municipality, only over 400 households in these three wards have come forward to get the connections. “We are spreading word among the people so that houses in the three wards will get an operational connection,” he said.
 
 “We have septic tanks and to get tankers come and collect sewage is a bigger pain. While the municipality prescribes Rs 300 for each tanker trip, the drivers demand a minimum of Rs 2,000. Once we call them, they come only after 15 days. More than eight years have passed but even the areas with ready sewerage and distribution lines are yet to get a functional system,” said T Sadagopan, a resident.
