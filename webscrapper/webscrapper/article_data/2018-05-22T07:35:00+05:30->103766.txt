GURUGRAM: A fire broke out at a   opposite Artemis Hospital in   on Monday morning, destroying nearly 60 shanties. Authorities suspect that a gas cylinder explosion in one of the shanties caused the fire. 

 The fire, which started around 11.10am, was brought under control in 45 minutes with the help of seven fire tenders from various fire stations. No deaths were reported but the shanties of several slum residents, along with cooking ware, fans, coolers and other household items, were completely destroyed.
 
 The district authorities have made alternative arrangements for the slum residents with the help of the district  . “We have set up all facilities and provided food, water and other essentials to the affected people,” said sub-divisional magistrate Sanjeev Singhla.
 
 According to sources, the shanties were built on   land. The slum residents said they used to pay between Rs 1,500 and 2,000 per month for each hut as rent.
 
 Singhla has issued a letter, seeking information about the owner of the land. He said the fire appeared to be similar to the one which broke out last month in a slum on Huda land in Sector 49, destroying nearly 150 shanties.
 
 Satyawan Samriwal, fire safety officer, Sector 29, said a spark in a gas cylinder pipe caused an explosion and started the fire. “Strong winds and combustible material aggravated the fire. A local saw smoke billowing from the slum and informed us,” he said.
 
 Another fire broke out at a cosmetics shop in Galleria market around 6.45pm, said fire officials. The fire started from the shop’s ceiling, which was stuffed with packaging material. 
 
 Lalit Kumar, a fire officer, said the fire at Inisfree cosmetics shop was caused by a short circuit but was soon brought under control with the help of the shop’s internal mechanism and two fire tenders. “The sprinklers in the shop could have doused the fire but those were attached to the ceiling,” Kumar said, adding that the merchandise was removed in time.
