CHENNAI: Transport corporations will soon affix tariff boards on all   soon, said state transport minister M R Vijayabaskar.

 The announcement comes in the backdrop of increased complaints from passengers that conductors collected excess ticket fare from them as they were unaware about the rates as per the recently revised fare slab.
 
 “These tariff boards will provide stagewise information on ticket fare to be collected from passengers,”   told reporters here on Tuesday.
 
 The minister made his announcement on the new policy on the sidelines of launching Closed User Group (CUG) mobiles for use of transport department staff. Nearly 404 android-based mobile phones with SIM cards procured at an estimated cost of Rs 87 lakh were provided to employees so that public can communicate with them and share their grievances every now and then.
 
 Besides this, he announced that demand for 4,000 new buses were presented to chief minister   and it would likely be cleared in this budget session. 
 
 Nearly 70 % government buses are over-aged as per government records. 
 
 When questioned about concession passes in   (MTC), the minister said there were no changes as far as Rs 1,000 monthly passes under Travel As You Please Ticket (TASYPT) scheme.
 
 “However, minimum rates for monthly seasonal tickets have been increase from Rs 240 to Rs 320. Distribution of daily passes was temporarily put on hold as the government is currently working on making it foolproof,” he said.
