LUCKNOW:   patriarch  , who has been facing the daunting task of keeping his flocks together, has got a shot in the arm with   requesting him to assume the role of its national president.

 Mulayam was a founding member of Lok Dal along with Chaudhary   in 1980.
 
 “Hum Netaji (Mulayam) ko wo pad denge jo unke bete ne unse chheen liya...hum unhein rashtriya adhyaksh banayeinge...party unki aur symbol bhi unka... (We will give Netaji the position his son snatched away from him...we will appoint him national president of the party...both party and its election symbol will be his),” Lok Dal chief   told TOI on phone from New Delhi on Saturday.
 
 The party has also agreed to reconsider the list of 68 candidates it has announced in UP, Singh said. The nomination for the first phase of UP poll begins on January 17. Singh said the party would reconsider the list of candidates if   took charge as Lok Dal national president. “There would be no controversy,” he assured.
 
 “We share the same ideology, so there is no problem if Netaji takes charge of the party,” he said. The Lok Dal website mentions Mulayam prominently along with leaders, such as Nitish Kumar, Ram Vilas Paswan, Rajendra Singh and Beni Prasad Verma.
 
 Singh said Mulayam’s brother Shivpal Yadav and   MP Amar Singh contacted him on January 1 when Ram Gopal Yadav called a party national convention and elected   as SP national president, replacing Mulayam. The same day, Akhilesh supporters staged a coup in the party office in Lucknow.
 
 Singh said he met Mulayam earlier this week when talks between Akhilesh and the SP patriarch for a patch-up did not materialise. “It is now known that Ram Gopal Yadav is acting on the directions of BJP and orchestrating differences between Netaji and his son,’’ he added.
