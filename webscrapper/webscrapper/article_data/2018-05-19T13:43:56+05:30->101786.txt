T Rajendharr’s   received a lukewarm response at the Box Office.   was last in KV Anand’s political thriller ‘Kavan’ in which he played a pivotal role. But now we hear from the sources that he is planning to make a satire comedy keeping the current politics in Tamil Nadu as a base.

 We can expect a lot of comedy actors in the film as we hear that Rajendharr is trying to rope in many eminent comedians. Actress   is going to a part of the film, as well. Sources say that Rajendharr will be producing the film under his own production house.
 Although Rajendharr gets trolled many times by the meme creators, we know he was one of the successful directors in ’80s where he has given us many blockbuster movies. Hope his next film clicks the same success and appreciation.
