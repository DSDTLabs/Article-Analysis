BARWANI: A group of parents has accused a private school management in Pansemal of keeping their children   during an educational   to Nandurbar (Maharashtra) and not taking care of their safety. 

 Rajendra Chaudhary and parents of other children told police that on January 27, Mahatma Gandhi Public School had taken 50 students for the educational tour. After returning from the tour the students complained that the school management did not provide food to them and they were hungry throughout the day.
 
 Chaudhary told police that his daughter Vaishnavi sustained injuries in her hands while swinging because the teachers did not care for the kidsâ€™ safety. He said that the school management misbehaved with the parents when they went to discuss about the issue.
 
 In the complaint, they mentioned that Rs 250 was charged from each student for the tour. Chaudhary has also lodged another complaint against the management of the school in Nandurbar.
 
 Refuting the allegations levelled on the school by the parents, director Ashok Jain told TOI that Vaishnavi was given proper treatment after injury, but when they returned to Pansemal, parents attacked the school staff and two teachers. "The students were given proper food and breakfast and they also came with their own lunchboxes. We have video recording also," said Jain adding that the school bore the treatment expenses of Vaishnavi.
 
 Pansemal TI PS Damor said complaints of school management and parents have been received and an inquiry has started. Police have on Wednesday recorded statements of management and parents, he added.
