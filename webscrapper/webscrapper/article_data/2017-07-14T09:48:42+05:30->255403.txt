 A formal event to mark the transition to an all-woman team at the station will be held soon, said the official.
 
 “So far, we used to preferably check tickets of women passengers, but ever since we came here we don’t hesitate to ask males for tickets,” a woman ticket-checker said.
 
 The idea to have a ‘ladies special’ station was floated by D K Sharma, general manager of CR.
