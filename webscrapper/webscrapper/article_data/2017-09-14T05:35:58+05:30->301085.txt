MUMBAI: Not only bulk generators like housing societies and restaurants, the   is also planning to rope in the slums in Mumbai for composting of garbage. The civic body has planned to initiate the concept of “community composting“, wherein garbage from slums would be brought in a common area and composted within the same locality itself.

 The BMC has already instructed its 24 ward officers to identify areas near slums where composting could take place. “We plan to ask those who go house to house to collect waste from slums to bring it to an area where it can be segregated and treated accordingly . The BMC would fund the expenses,“ said an official. Civic officials said this would eventually save the travel cost incurred as well as time taken for transportation of garbage from slums to the dumps in the city. As per the 2011 census, around 41% of Mumbai lives in slums.
 
 All these steps come in view of the BMC's October 2 deadline from when the civic body has decided not to lift wet garbage from those which generate over 100 kg of waste daily. These waste generators are expected to segregate and treat their garbage within their premises. By doing so, the BMC is anticipating that the waste taken to dumping grounds — Deonar, Kanjurmarg and Mulund — would come down to 6,500 metric tons from the current 7,600 metric tons. However, with the slums also being roped in, the BMC believes they would be able to bring down waste collection further to below 5,000 metric tons.
 
 Dr   from  , who has been working in the space of waste management for the last four years, said a big problem with slums is that they do not keep dustbins and are seen disposing off their waste in the nearby nullahs.
