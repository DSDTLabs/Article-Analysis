MADURAI: In a major gaffe by the CBSE, around 110 candidates from various districts who appeared for NEET here were issued the Hindi version of the question paper. They were made to wait till afternoon and given photocopies of the Tamil   but asked to answer in the OMR sheet of the Hindi question paper. Many students said their MBBS dreams were over.

 
 The goof-up happened at Noyes Matriculation School at   which had a total of 568 students sitting for the examination. When the first batch of students came out after the exam around 1 pm, many parents couldn’t spot their wards. C Shanmugam of Theni found that his son Mahendran had come out, but not his elder son. After waiting for about half an hour, the parents gheraoed the school principal who told them that their children had been given Hindi question papers. They were waiting for the Tamil question papers to be sent from New Delhi.
 
 “That was such a mockery as it was clear that it was impossible for question papers to be brought from Delhi today. Later we came to know that the students were given photocopies of the question paper,” said Thirumurugan of Theni. Fourteen students were made to write the examination from 12.30pm to 3.30pm and another 96 students from 3.30pm to 6pm.
 
 A R Olivia of   said that she was shocked to see that she was given a photocopied question paper. The invigilators took back the paper after asking them to give an undertaking that they had handed back the question paper on their own and not been forced to do so.
