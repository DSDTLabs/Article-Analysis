GHAZIABAD: The traffic police in the city have decided to start a campaign next week to check if   follow rules and ply on designated routes with proper documents and permits. 

 Officials said autos would not be allowed to carry extra passengers and drivers would have to wear proper uniform — grey shirt and trousers —during working hours.
 
 SSP Vaibhav Krishna said there are around 12,000 three-seater and around 2,000 seven-seater autorickshaws in the city, but most of them ferried more passengers than permitted. The senior officer said that with the help of the transport department, severe action, such as suspension of driving licences, will be taken against errant drivers. 
 
 For traffic violations like rash driving and parking on the wrong side, the traffic wing will issue challans. “We are also working on a mechanism to issue them identity cards so that their verification can be done by the department easily. The seven-seater autos are supposed to ply on pre-decided routes, but this rule is also being violated with impunity. This issue will be taken care of by the new mechanism,” Krishna said. Autorickshaw drivers will also be fined for playing loud music in the vehicles. The SSP had conducted an operation named Chakravyuh against unauthorised transport vehicles and auto-rickshaws on April 19. 
 
 Altogether 1,524 vehicles were seized and 662 were challaned during the drive that was conducted in two phases on April 19. A sum of Rs 1.18 lakh was also recovered in fines.
