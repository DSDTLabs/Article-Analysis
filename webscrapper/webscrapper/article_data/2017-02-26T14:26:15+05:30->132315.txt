 Says Arun, 'My film had been selected for the  , and I had gone there for the screening. Before the screening, I was inviting people to come and watch the film. That is when a person came up to me and told me that he would like to watch it. I gave him the invite and as I was about to leave, out of curiosity, asked for his business card. It was only then that I realised that he was from the Hollywood studio. Later, he put me on to executives at the studio in India. I screened the film for them and they loved it, and came forward to distribute it. I'm happy that my film is the first south Indian film that the studio, which was behind films like Harry Potter , Gravity and Interstellar, are distributing.' The director adds that the film has so far been selected for film festivals in nine countries, and has bagged 15 international honours and seven international awards.
