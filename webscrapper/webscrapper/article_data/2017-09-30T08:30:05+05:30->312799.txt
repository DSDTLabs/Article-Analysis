 With the passage of time, tazias that once towered at 52 feet in the Holkar era have now decreased to just 12.5 feet. A tazia is a replica of the tomb of Imam Hussain, the martyred grandson of Prophet Muhammad. It is organised by Muslims during processions on Muharram.
 
 Sarfaraz, who represents the third generation of a family that has been making tazias not only for the Bada Imambada but for other mosques in the city, said “We begin making the tazia seven months in advance. It is a time consuming task and needs dedication. The cost of the tazia can go up all the way to Rs 70,000.”
 
 Sarfaraz and his team of six not only make the official tazia, but also those for Khajrana, Azad Nagar, Chandan Nagar on order. Their heights vary from six feet to 12.5 feet and the material required to make them includes paper, bamboo, glass shards, ropes, etc.
 
 Tazias will be carried in a procession around Rajwada and old parts of the city on Saturday night. Thereafter, they will be taken out again on Sunday afternoon till Karbala Maidan before passing through Pandharinath, Machhi Bazaar and the Collectorate, where it will be buried after three days.
 
 The Bohra community in the city will observe Muharram on Saturday to mourn the death of Imam Hussain at mosques and private residences. “Since Hussain and his 72 men had died after three days of starvation, we will also starve throughout the day on Saturday as a mark of mourning,” said community spokesperson Burhanuddin Shakruwala.
