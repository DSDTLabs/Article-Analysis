BENGALURU: The   ( ) on Sunday said   needn’t worry about security aspects of the Palike’s   and that they can continue to pay property tax.

 Asked about the apprehensions of taxpayers over the site’s security certificate lapsing, BBMP joint commissioner (revenue) M Venkatachalapathy clarified the safety certificate for the website — bbmptax-.karnataka.gov.in — was supposed to be renewed by the State Data Centre, but it wasn’t done as the authorities were worried if it’d mean violating the model code of conduct.
 
 “But they were given a clarification and the issue will be sorted out by Monday. Despite that, online transactions are safe as they are done through associated banks which have safety features,” he added.
 
 Another BBMP official said online payments haven’t stopped and they have received Rs 44 crore in property tax on that mode till Sunday morning.
 
 However, several taxpayers seem to be worried as whenever they have tried paying tax online, they have got alerts reading: “You should not enter any sensitive information on this site because it could be stolen.” For many others, a slow server is a major worry as they have to wait for long to make payment online. As most BBMP officials are busy with poll duty, people prefer online payment, but glitches are preventing them from completing the process.
