AHMEDABAD:   is the the go-to investigator for city cops when a major theft or burglary takes place. She is not a detective but a canine tracker, who on Wednesday added another solved case to her kitty.

 Ramdevsinh Jadeja, the labrador’s handler, beams with pride. “She was given the scent of cash kept in the drawer where the suspect had also touched the key. As it was a case where police had a few suspects, she directly approached the 19-year-old youth who soon confessed to the crime,” he said. 
 
 The case involved the theft of Rs 5 lakh cash from an office in Gulbai Tekra. Gujarat University (GU) police have already recovered Rs 4.36 lakh from the former employee. 
 
  officials said that in the last year, Noor has also been instrumental in solving property-related offences in Satellite, Ramol, Kagdapith and Shahibaug areas. Noor was gifted to Gujarat Police by an individual three years ago, when she was three months old. The cops are proud of her tracking abilities.
 
 Nanubha Jadeja, an ADI with the dog squad, said that city police has four trackers of breeds like Labrador and Dobermann, who attends to four or five cases on a daily basis. “These include murder, loot, assault or property-related offences. Many times, the dogs provide initial clues which help investigators decide on the course of investigation,” he said.
