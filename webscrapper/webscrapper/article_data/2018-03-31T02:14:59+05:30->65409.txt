Actor   took to social media to take down a magazine, which body shamed him in an article titled 'The Great Sadness of Ben Affleck'.
According to a report, Affleck responded to a magazine which suggested he was depressed after new photos surfaced of Affleck on a beach with a large tattoo of a phoenix on his back.
 When the tattoo was first spotted in 2016, Affleck insisted it was fake and just for a movie. 
 
 
  
 The article said that ever since Affleck's 2015 split from actress  , paparazzi photographs have shown a "sad Ben", from him vaping in his car to the low-energy interviews he gave during the press tour.
 
 The article drew backlash online this week as the story also appeared to fat-shame Affleck with lines like, "his gut is pooching" and "a blue-gray towel is wrapped protectively around his midsection-recalling a shy teen at the local pool."
 
 The images were taken while Affleck was filming in a movie 'Triple Frontier' in Hawaii with  ,   and   Isaac, who were also photographed in the water.
