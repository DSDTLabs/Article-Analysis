PANAJI: Additional solicitor general ( ) of India Atmaram   on Friday said if royalty is paid to the government for ore extracted before March 15, the   companies are free to transport it or use it.

 Asked about the high court’s interim order stopping mining companies from transporting iron ore, extracted before March 15, Nadkarni said the   order had made it clear that mining operations shall stop with effect from March 16 and till March 15 the mining companies could have extracted ore.
 
 “Once you extract ore, you have to pay royalty on it and you have to take it out. After that you have to utilise the ore somewhere, some people may export it and some people may use it for captive consumption, whatever it is. Supreme court has not stopped that,” Nadkarni said.
 
 Speaking to reporters, ASG said, in fact Goa Foundation through their counsel   made a plea before the apex court saying, ‘Goa government permitted transportation’.
 
 When the court asked me about this it was replied by me that government has not permitted any transportation, ASG said. “ what is being transported is not from the lease area, but from outside, which was extracted before March 15 and on which royalty has been paid. Judge has told me to file proper application and we will deal with it,” Nadkarni said
 
 Reacting to high court order, he said 
 
 “I’m not aware about it and I cannot comment on the high court order, but as far as the transportation goes, once royalty is paid on extracted ore and it is taken outside the lease area, they (lease holder) are free to take it anywhere,” Nadkarni said.
