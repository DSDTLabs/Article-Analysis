HYDERABAD: Two days after director   and a few others levelled charges against investigators involved in the drugs case, prohibition and excise department enforcement director Akun Sabharwal on Monday said he may file a   if the alleged unsubstantiated comments about the ongoing investigation and officers are not stopped. 

 "In every aspect of the investigation, we are following the SC guidelines. I would also like to clarify to those persons, who had made allegations that excise department has no power to investigate NDPS Act cases, in June 2016 the state government issued a GO, giving all the powers needed to investigate the NDPS-related cases,'' he said. 
 
 Akun said that without having privy to details in the case diary, it was incorrect on the part of some to pass a judgement on the investigation. "Till now, 27 persons, including five persons from the film industry, were questioned. The persons who were questioned hail from various sections of society. So, making allegations that only one industry (i.e.,  ) as alleged by some persons is not correct,'' the director added. 
 
 To a question by filmmaker Ram Gopal Verma on whether schoolkids would also be questioned, the officer said identity of children would never be disclosed.
