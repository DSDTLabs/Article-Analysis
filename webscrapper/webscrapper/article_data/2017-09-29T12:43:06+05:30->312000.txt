CHANDIGARH: The   government has placed two officials of the Palwal municipal council (MC) under suspension on charges of manipulation of data on sex ratio. It has also ordered disciplinary action against the duo.

 Stating this, urban local bodies minister Kavita Jain said the registrar and sub-registrar (birth and death) of municipal council, Palwal, had provided data in March 2017 as per which 1,217 girls per 1,000 boys were shown to be born in the council area while the office of the director general (health services) recorded the birth of 950 girls per 1,000 boys in the state.
 
 After the report aroused suspicion, it was scrutinized by the chief registrar’s office that confirmed manipulation in the data, which resulted error in the sex ratio record in Palwal district. From January 2017 to March 2017, the figure of 1,383 girls for 1,000 boys was recorded by the municipality whereas during the investigation it was found to be 906 girls for 1,000 boys.
 
 The minister said the council had recorded a figure of 957 girls in January 2017, 990 in February and 1,217 in March the same year whereas after investigation the same was found to be 930 for January, 951 for February and 983 for March. In June 2017 this figure was updated to 912 instead of 910 per 1,000 boys; 940 instead of 930 in March; and 932 instead of 928 for the January-March quarter.
 
 Taking cognizance of the negligence, the state government has immediately suspended registrar (birth and death)   and sub-registrar  .
 
 Jain said, “The government is shouldering its responsibility towards daughters dedicatedly and careless and erring employees will not be spared.”
