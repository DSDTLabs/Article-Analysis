Chandigarh: A joint forum of Chamber of Chandigarh Industries (CCI) and Chandigarh Industrial Youth Association (CIYA) has requested the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) to direct UT administration to redress issues pertaining to allotment of industrial sheds by Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Development Corporation (CITCO).

 In a letter to joint secretary of MHA, CCI president Naveen Manglani said CITCO had imposed violation charges on owners of industrial sheds on flimsy grounds. He said the violation charges were imposed after an inspection of 548 sheds was carried out over a month, but this was not humanly possible.
 
 Manglani said ClTCO was not competent to charge penal interest, especially with retrospective effect, and override conditions of lease deed. “It is a breach of contract, unilaterally. Furthermore, they deliberately delayed intimation of any violation resulting in a drastic increase in penal interest liability of the lessees,” said Manglani.
 
 CITCO had allotted industrial sheds in batches after 1981 to entrepreneurs on terms and conditions as per lease deed executed between CITCO and entrepreneurs at a total cost of construction along with 15% profit thereon to be received in 10 installments along with interest. There was a ban on the allottees to sell or transfer the sheds for 15 years.
 
 After the expiry of 15 years, CITCO had to restore leasehold rights which it failed to execute. 
 
 The joint forum contended that as per the Capital of Punjab Act, 1952, CITCO was not competent to form a policy to charge a fee for giving permission to sublet a part of shed. This power was never entrusted to CITCO either by the lease deed or by their rules or by the statute, it claimed. As a matter of fact, it said, fee is levied for rendition of special services. “The administration had formed a four-member committee to resolve the issue, but no success has been achieved so far,” said Manglani.
