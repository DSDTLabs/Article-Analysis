Gurgaon: Agitating lecturers called off their statewide strike on Saturday after the director general of higher education ( ) promised to look into their demands and address their grievances. The development paved the way for regular classes at government colleges in Gurgaon with around 250 ‘extension’ (guest) teachers planning to resume work on Monday.

 A delegation of Extension Lecturers’ Association met DGHE A Sreenivasan at Shiksa Sadan on Saturday to press for better remuneration.
 
 “The DGHE has admitted our demands are legitimate and promised to fulfil them. So, we are calling off the stir and classes will be resumed from Monday. We are equally concerned about students, whose exams are round the corner. They (education department officials) asked for two days and we have given them seven. Now, we don’t want to be disappointed. If they don’t do anything in seven days, we will resume our strike,” Sumer Singh, spokesperson for the lecturers’ association, said.
 
 Sources said a delegation of teachers was supposed to meet chief minister Mahohar Lal   on Friday. However, he was not available. “Instead, the lectures met Bopeshwar Dayal, the officer on special duty to CM. He persuaded them to call off their strike and promised to meet their demands,” said a source.
 
 Agitating under the banner of All Haryana Extension Lecturers’ Association that launched a state-level strike last month, the lecturers alleged the government had failed to implement the Punjab and Haryana high court’s directive (dated May 5, 2016) to pay   as per UCG norms.
