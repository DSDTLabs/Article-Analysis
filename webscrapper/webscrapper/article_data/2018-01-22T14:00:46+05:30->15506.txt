COIMBATORE: Southern railway has introduced two new passenger special trains from Coimbatore to Pollachi from Monday. The train services will be available on all days except Sundays, an official communication from the   railway division said.

 The Coimbatore-Pollachi Passenger Special (train no. 06083) will leave Coimbatore at 5.15am and reach Pollachi at 6.45am. Another passenger special (train no. 06085) will leave Coimbatore at 6pm and reach Pollachi at 7.15pm. 
 
 The Pollachi-Coimbatore Passenger Special (train no. 06084) will leave Pollachi at 7.15am and reach Coimbatore at 8.30am. Another train (no. 06086) will leave Pollachi at 7:45pm and reach Coimbatore at 9pm, it added.
 
 This comes as a boon to commuters who travel to Pollachi from the city on a daily basis, in the face of the sudden and steep hike in bus fares. 
 
 An official from the Salem railway division said the move comes after there was a demand for more trains from Coimbatore to Pollachi. 
 
 “There had been consistent demand for more trains from commuters since the completion of Podanur-Pollachi broad gauge (BG) line. The special passenger trains have been introduced in view of that,” the official said.
 
 The official said higher officials of the Salem railway division, after consulting with their counterparts in Chennai and Madurai divisions, have decided on the timings of the trains.
 
  The official added that they expected a good patronage for the train services.
 
 M  , chairman of Railway Passenger Amenities Association, Coimbatore, said though the point to point service will be helpful for commuters, those travelling to stations in between such as   and   will be even more benefitted.
 
 Some passengers said the timing of the morning train could be a bit later. 
 
 An official, however, said they had taken several parameters such as availability of rakes and tracks into considerations before deciding on the train timings.
