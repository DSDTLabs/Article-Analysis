AHMEDABAD:   Archana   has lodged a complaint under section 498(a) for mental and physical abuse against her husband Mohammed Arif Khan, 36, at Shahibaug police station. 

 Archana alleged that Khan was in extra-marital relationship and would abuse her and beat her up. 
 
 Police sources said they have arrested Khan and have released him on bail.
 
 According to complaint, Archana met Khan, then a cycle dealer, about four years ago and they married after a brief courtship. “They have a three- year-old son,” said a police official.
 
 Police officials said Archana stated in the FIR that after running into losses in his business, Khan started a South Indian fast food outlet.
 
 “Archana alleges that of late, Khan had entered an illicit relationship with another woman and had started abusing her physically and mentally. He used to verbally abuse her, demand money and even beat her up,” said a police official.
 
 According to the FIR, as Archana works five days a week, she went to parents’ house in Shahibaug last weekend. “On Monday, September 25, after returning from Mumbai Khan called Archana and then rushed to her parents’ house,” added a police source.
 
 Police officials said that Archana’s mother   and father   told Khan to leave their home because of his indecent behavior. 
 
 “As Khan left, Archana ran after him to reconcile but Khan dragged her by her hair and assaulted her in front of the security guard,” said a police official.
