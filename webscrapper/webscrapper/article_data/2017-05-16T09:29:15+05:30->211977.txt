Mumbai: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has directed an inquiry after a resident from   slums complained that his sister’s house was declared   and demolished despite the structure having all necessary permissions. Slumdweller Ravi Yadav had raised the complaint during the Lokshahi Din on Monday. 

 Yadav alleged that the authorities, in collusion with a developer, had denied legal status to his sister’s house and had demolished it. Fadnavis has ordered an inquiry and demanded a report.
 
 Fadnavis ordered officials to dispose of citizens’ pending cases in the next three days. He told them that they should not wait for cases to come up in front of him on Lokshahi Din and should act on them independently. The CM heard 23 cases on Monday.
