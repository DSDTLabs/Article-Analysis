KOLKATA: The Gangasagar Mela, which is the second biggest congregation in the country after  , broke all previous records on many counts and became a model for a big congregation in Bengal. Gangasagar has recorded around 30 lakh pilgrims this year, which is 10 lakh more than last year. Officials predict there will be around 40 lakh people in 2019.

 
 From ferrying lakhs of pilgrims across   to remote surveillance of the entire progress of a pilgrim, right from its transit camp at Kolkata’s Babughat to   that’s 142 km away, Sagar has earned a lot of appreciation, including that for being the cleanest and safest Ganga Sagar Mela.
 
 The death of 42 pilgrims last year was the ultimate alert. “We had round-theclock surveillance of live feeds from 500 CCTV cameras set all along the pilgrims’ route. This enabled us to monitor almost every move of cluster of pilgrims at different points on the route. Since most of the pilgrims do fasting before their holy dip in Sagar, we tried our best to reduce the retention time and kept distributing water pouches so that no one suffers during the pilgrims’ progress,” said South 24 Parganas district magistrate  , the man behind the mega-management’s standard operating procedure (SOP).
 
 A real-time vessel information system also helped the administration to orderly disperse the pilgrims. The giant display boards at every ghat automatically displayed the arrival and departure of the vessels and also displayed tidal information on which the vessel movement is solely dependent on. This information system ruled out the uncertainty of ferry services.
 
 There was seamless coordination between central security agencies like   (BSF) and  , who maintained strict surveillance along the coast.
