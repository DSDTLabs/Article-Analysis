MUMBAI: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act court on Friday sentenced a man to ten years’ imprisonment for sodomizing a friend’s three-year-old daughter. The accused, Suraj Tiwari, has been in jail since arrest in 2014. 

 A complaint was filed with the Wadala TT police by the child’s mother on May 22, 2014. The mother told the police that she would leave for work at 6am and return by 4pm, leaving her two daughters alone at home. The mother said that on the day of the incident, her husband was at home but was sleeping as he had suffered an injury to his leg. When she returned from work, she could not find her younger daughter. The elder daughter told her that the accused had visited their home in the afternoon and watched television. When the mother began to look for the victim, she found her near a public toilet near their home. The mother told the police that the girl was crying and shivering. When she asked her what had happened, the child told her that the accused had taken her to nearby shrubs and sexually assaulted her. The child complained of pain and the mother examined her body. Seeing injuries on her private parts, she went to the police. 
 
 The mother and the minor deposed in court against the accused. The accused filed several bail pleas, which were rejected. He claimed that he was falsely implicated by the child’s mother due to a prior feud.
 
 The court while rejecting his bail pleas had said that the child was known to the accused and there was no question of mistaken identity, a claim which the accused made in his defence. The court also observed that a doctor’s report showed that a medical examination had revealed abrasions on the child’s chin, lips and private parts.
