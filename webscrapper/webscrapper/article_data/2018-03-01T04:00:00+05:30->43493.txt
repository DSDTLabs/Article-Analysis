Vadodara: Police interrogated the driver of the red car who was seen in the CCTV camera footages at the time of accident which killed 13-year-old Het Chauhan outside Jai Ambe School on February 24 morning. 
 
 Cops called the driver, who is a resident of Karelibaug, after probing footages of 15 CCTV cameras around the school. Police sources said that after checking the footages and interrogating the man for two hours, it seemed unlikely that the accident was caused because of the car. 
  
 “After seeing footages of nearby Axis Bank, we too suspected initially that the car might have caused the accident. But since the footages were not clear, we checked footages of other cameras and called the person,” said a police officer. 
  
 Police said CCTV cameras revealed that the car was actually parked there and not moving as it was being said earlier. The driver told the police that he had come there to drop his daughter and was waiting there after parking his car with his colleagues. After the accident too, the man was present there for more than an hour, the police said. 
  
 After Chauhan, a student of class VI, was mowed down by a state transport bus outside his school on February 24 ahead of cycle marathon organized by the school CCTV camera footage of nearby Axis Bank went viral on social media websites and applications with allegations that the car was coming from wrong side and it knocked down Chauhan and other student because of which the boy was ran over by the bus.
