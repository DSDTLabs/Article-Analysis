BHOPAL: Two motorcycleborne assailants threw acid on two girls in Dindori district when they were returning home after school exams.
 
 They are cousins and study in Class XI. Police have picked up a few suspects but have no leads yet. A witness who chased the bikers for a while said that the driver was wearing a full-face helmet and the pillion rider was masked. They had covered the number plate with cloth.
 
 Police said the girls were only 1km from home near   when the bikers waylaid them. The pillion rider splashed the contents of a bottle on their faces and they sped away. The girls first thought it was water but within seconds, the acid started burning into their flesh and they ran towards their house, screaming in agony.
 
 They were taken to hospital in a Dial 100 vehicle. One of the girls may be disfigured for life, fear doctors. The other one doesn’t have too many facial burns but her back is covered with burns. Both of burns on their hands. Police have barricaded roads and are looking for the assailants, who were on a red motorcycle.
 
 The attack indicates that it’s still easy to get your hands on acid.
 
 
 
 
 Following a   directive, the MP government had in 2013 tightened acid-sale rules, and introduced a threemonth jail term and Rs 50,000 fine for selling acid without licence or not maintaining a proper record of sale.
 
 Buyers need to provide a photoidentity proof to the seller and subdivisional magistrates were expected to monitor the sale of acid in their areas, but to no avail.
 
 An acid attack victim will be given a compensation of Rs 3 lakh — Rs 1 lakh within a fortnight and the balance over the next two months, as specified by the Supreme Court in July 2013.
 
 The   had directed states and Union territories to frame rules to regulate sale of acid and make acid attack a non-bailable offence.
