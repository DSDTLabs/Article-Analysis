Conservator of forests and director of the   S   was killed in an attack by an elephant in Mysuru’s DB Kuppe forest range on Saturday. 

 The incident took place when the   officer had gone to assess the damage caused by a fire allegedly set by miscreants. Officers said Manikandan (46), forest range officer   and around 15 staff were taking the GPS reading of the fire when a tusker attacked him. 
 
 “While others managed to flee, Manikandan was trampled,” an officer said, adding that his body would be taken to Madurai for the last rites. APCCF Bengaluru (Project Elephant)   said, “Manikandan knew a lot about animals, particularly those found in the   forest. 
 
 He was documenting every elephant in the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve.”
