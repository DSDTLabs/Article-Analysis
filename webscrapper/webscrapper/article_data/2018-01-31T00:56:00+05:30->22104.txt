Madurai: While expressing concern over the poor sex ratio in Virudhunagar district Union minster for defence Nirmala Sitharaman said that all steps would be taken to develop the district in a phased manner by 2022.

 The review meeting, titled transforming aspirational district, was held on Tuesday, in which Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan, minister K T Rajendra Bhalaji, Virudhunagar collector A Sivagnanam and other officials participated. 
 
 According to sources, the minister had expressed concern at the falling sex ratio in Virudhunagar district which had fallen to 937 females per 1,000 males, according to the 2017 report released by the Centre.
 
 Officials said that there was high number of abortions in some blocks in the districts such as Narikudi and Tiruchuzhi. These were some of the most backward blocks where the sex ratio at birth was just 850/1,000.
 
 Speaking to media persons after the meeting, Nirmala Sitharaman said that all steps would be taken to ensure that Virudhunagar district would be developed in a phased manner between 2018 and 2022, to make it a developed district in all aspects. The blue print would be prepared for this she said.
 
 “Virudhunagar is lagging behind other developed districts in terms of poverty and infrastructure facilities. 15 per cent of the population is unemployed and about 3.14 lakh are employed under MGNREGS. Providing them with alternative employment was also discussed at the meeting,” she said.
 
 Insurance firms would be asked to disburse farmers insurances on time and livelihood of farmers would be enhanced through farmer producer organisations, the minister said.
 
 On a question on protecting the welfare of the fireworks industry workers she said that it was for the Tamil Nadu government to take appropriate steps and could not comment on it further as it was a sub-judice matter.
 
 Public health, poverty, infrastructure, education and child welfare would be given extra thrust under the scheme.
