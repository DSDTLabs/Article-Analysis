GUWAHATI:  , the largest river island in the world, has received a major boost in its quest to get the coveted Unesco   tag with the selection of a new consultancy firm which will be delegated with the responsibility of preparing the nomination dossier. On Sunday, a senior official told TOI the state cultural affairs department is to confirm the appointment of the firm ' ' in the coming days. 

 ICLEI (International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives) will decide on what basis Majuli's case for deserving to be on the   list will be promoted. On Unesco's tentative list since 2004, Majuli's quest to cement its place as a World Heritage Site has met with failures several times over the years.
 
 In May, the state government had issued an expression of interest (EOI) to potential consultancy agencies to come forward in the preparation of Majuli's nomination dossier. "There were four bidders who had responded to our EOI. ICLIE was selected based on their experience. The selection will be confirmed once the work order is issued by the director of cultural affairs. Once it is issued the work on the dossier will commence," the senior official said.
 
 Another official, speaking on the next course of action, said, "There are so many attributes surrounding Majuli that can be projected in the nomination dossier. Majuli can also be projected as a mixed site with its cultural landscape and biodiversity. We have to decide on that. A retired bureaucrat will oversee the work on the nomination dossier."
