KOCHI: Kerala State   Association (KSVA) suffered another blow on Thursday when the Kerala State   (KSSC) suspended the state volleyball body after finding irregularities in the district association elections held recently. According to  , the officials of KSVA were asked to appear before the council in Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday to explain election-related issues but none of the representatives turned up which forced the council to suspend the body with immediate effect, subject to enquiry.

 “We had sent our observers for the district elections and they had mentioned about the breach of rules while conducting elections. We asked KSVA to submit a report on this but they refuted the observers’ claims. Later, they sent a letter saying they found some issues in two districts, Kollam and Palakkad. So we asked them to come to us on July 13 to discuss it. But the KSVA asked for 15 days to explain things which we denied. They haven’t come for Thursday’s meeting which forced us to take this extreme step,” TP Dasan, KSSC president, told TOI on Thursday.
 
 Meanwhile, KSVA secretary   said that the council did not grant them enough time to explain their part. “We asked for 15 days but KSSC was not supportive. We will face it legally and KSVA will conduct the state body elections on July 16. We will be having observers from VFI,” said Basheer.
 
 The suspension means that the state volleyball body will stop receiving funds from KSSC. The elections and merit certificates signed by KSVA officials will not have any recognition too.
 
 The relationship between KSVA and KSSC has been topsy-turvy for the last few months. Earlier in February, KSSC had asked explanation from Basheer for his comments against Arjuna awardee and former Indian captain Tom Joseph.
