BATHINDA: Of the four AAP candidates who were elected as MPs during the 2014 general elections, only   is campaigning for the party. While Patiala MP   and his Fatehgarh Sahib counterpart,  , remain suspended from the party, the third MP - Prof Sadhu Singh (75) from Faridkot - is rarely seen on the field. 

 Though, officially, Prof Sadhu's health and age have been cited as the reasons behind his avoiding canvassing, sources close to him said he was lying low because he was not satisfied with the allocation of two party tickets in Faridkot parliamentary constituency and even AAP was not much enthusiastic about campaigning across Punjab.
 
 Sources said party's candidates were facing a tough time in replying to queries by people about his absence. Prof Sadhu, however, has been seen everytime when AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal and the party's Punjab affairs in charge,  , have visited the parliamentary constituency. 
 
 When contacted, Sadhu said said he was down with dengue fever recently and had not yet recovered "fully". "My old age is also coming in the way of aggressive campaigning. Still, I am devoting time to campaign for party candidates in assembly segments falling under my parliamentary constituency. I can't match the aggression of Bhagwant Mann, who is the star campaigner of the party and is young. I am doing my bit; there is absolutely no anger with the party over ticket allocation," he said.
 
  convener   denied that Prof Sadhu was upset with the party. "He is not keeping well. He had remained bedridden for many days and old age is keeping him away from campaigning, even though we wanted him to campaign aggressively for the party," he said.
