CHENNAI:   chief minister   on Monday distributed an interim financial assistance for   affected by oil spill in Chennai. 

 The oil spill caused by the collision of two ships – MT BW Maple and MT Dawn Kanchipuram – off Ennore port on January 28 hit fish sales hard with a majority of city residents raising apprehensions over contamination in fish caught near Chennai.
  
 Addressing the gathering on the occasion, Palaniswami said the state government had written to the director general of shipping to facilitate compensation to the tune of Rs 135.35 crore from insurance companies for the affected fishermen. 
 
 Noting that 104 kilomteres of coastal line in Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts bore the brunt of the oil spill, he said, "Fishermen in these districts are struggling as their catch is not attracting reasonable price." 
 
 Under such circumstances, the state government has come to the rescue of the fishing community by providing an interim financial aid of Rs 5,000 to each of the 30,000 affected fishermen at a total outlay of Rs 15 crore, he added.
  
 Earlier, fisheries minister D Jayakumar allayed fears of consumers over contamination in seafood saying fish caught near Chennai does not cause any health hazards. 
 
 "The oil spill was on the shoreline. Fishermen navigate for about 200 miles away from the shore for deep sea fishing," he said. 
 
 He said a sample test conducted after the oil spill has proved that fish was not contaminated.
