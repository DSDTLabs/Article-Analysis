Ahmedabad: The Central Bureau of Investigation ( ) approached a special court here on Tuesday and requested it to declare promoters of Diamond Power Infrastructure Ltd ( ) as absconders in connection with the probe in the alleged Rs 2,654 crore bank fraud.

 CBI officials approached special CBI judge N G Dave and urged for proclamation that Amit Bhatnagar, his brother Sumit and father Suresh are absconding. If CBI gets the proclamation order under Section 82 of the CrPC, it may pave way for attachment of their properties under Section 83 of the CrPC.
 
 Earlier, after registering an FIR against the trio for allegedly defrauding 11 banks of Rs 2,654 crore, CBI issued a notice under Section 41A of the CrPC asking the accused persons to appear before the investigators giving them a chance to explain their position regarding non-repayment of loans and alleged monitory irregularities. However, none turned up in response to the notice.
 
 Instead, the   approached the court and sought anticipatory bail claiming they have not committed any fraud and none of the banks has filed a complaint against them. It was a simple case of no-repayment of loans. The registration of FIR by CBI was not according to the CBI manual, said the Bhatnagars, because there was no informer. Without any complainant, a person cannot be charged for cheating.
 
 CBI, on the other hand, insisted that gross illegalities were committed by DPIL promoters and it required a thorough investigation and that the accused personsâ€™ presence was needed during the probe.
 
 The court denied pre-arrest bail to the Bhatnagars. As they did not appear before the investigator in response to the notice issued to them two weeks ago, the CBI approached the court again last week and obtained non-bailable warrants against them.
