Namakkal: The sleuths attached to the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) took out a surprise raid at Namakkal South Regional Transport Office (RTO) on Tuesday evening and seized Rs 2 lakh in cash as officials there failed to produce documents to prove the source of money.

 According to a DVAC source, the search that began around 7pm would continue through the night. “So far, we have seized Rs 2 lakh unaccounted money from the office,” the DVAC sleuth said.
 
 A team of DVAC officials led by DSP Krishnarajan took out the search operation based on a tip that RTO officials were accepting bribe from the public. “We also came to know that RTO officials had demanded bribe from women applied for learner’s licence to avail the state government’s subsidy of Rs 25,000 for Amma scooter scheme. We will take action against RTO officials, including south regional transport officer Duraisamy, if they were found guilty,” the official said.
