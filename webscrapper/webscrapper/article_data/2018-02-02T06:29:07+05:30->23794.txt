AHMEDABAD: A 16-year-old, class IX girl committed suicide at her home in Bavla on Wednesday. Sources said that she was stressed because some boys threatened to post pictures on social media.

 Police registered a case of abetment of suicide against three boys on the basis of her suicide note.
 
 Bavla police said Priyanka (name changed) studied at a girls school in Bavla. She went to go to a tuition class in the town where she met Dhruv, Ritik and Vruttik. The three allegedly used to harass her. On January 17, when she went to GEB office, Vruttik met her and Ritik and Dhruv clicked their pictures together with Ritikâ€™s mobile phone.
 
 A police official said that the three boys then started harassing her and threatened to post the photos on social media sites. When Priyanka told her mother, she called Ritik and told him delete the pictures and not to harass her daughter. 
 
 On January 31, the family was in their drawing room while Priyanka was studying upstairs. When she did not come down for dinner, her mother went up and found her hanging from a fan with a dupatta. 
 
 Police said Priyanka left behind a note naming the three boys, all 16, for harassment and driving her to suicide.
