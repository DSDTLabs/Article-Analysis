NAGPUR: At least six candidates, whose nomination forms were rejected for the civic elections slated for February 21, have moved the court against the decision. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s election department received 1,810 nomination papers of which 171 forms were rejected.

 Among those who have approached the court are BSP’s Sagar Lokhande and Mukesh Meshram. “Both filed nomination forms from Prabhag No. 23C and D seats. However, during scrutiny, discrepancies were found in their forms,” said an NMC election department officer. “The court has rejected their pleas,” he added.
 
 The others who approached the court after their forms were rejected were: Nalini Karangale (Prabhag 17-B, no affidavit),   (Prabhag 11), Deepak Mule and Vinod Meshram (Prabhag 17, insufficient documents and missing of caste validity certificates). 
 
 On Monday, 81 candidates withdrew their nomination forms. Ashi Nagar (15) and Gandhibagh zone (10) witnessed the highest withdrawals. The deadline for withdrawal of nomination forms ends at 3pm on Tuesday. 
 
 Sitting   corporator Gopal Bohare withdrew his nomination form. He had filed as an independent candidate after BJP denied the party’s candidature to him. A party insider said Bohare withdrew his nominations after Union minister Nitin Gadkari‘s intervention.
 
 Meanwhile, the NMC will publish the final voters list on Wednesday and on the same day it will also distribute symbols.
