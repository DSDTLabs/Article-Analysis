TV actor   was looking forward to his debut on the cricket-based reality show, 'Box Cricket League', but an ugly turn of events has left him disturbed and disillusioned. 
Kanwar, who was chosen as one of the top 12 players for team  , alleges that one of his team members asked him to ‘rest outside’ on the day of the first match, last week. History repeated during the second match and when it was time for the third one, the actor decided to put his best foot forward despite being down with viral fever. However, he was once again allegedly stopped at the venue, with the team member informing him that he’ll only be allowed to play in the last match.   confronted the team member, which soon turned into a heated argument. Both the members could be pacified only after other teammates intervened. 
 Recalling the issue, the actor says, “My bone of contention is including me in the top 12 and not letting me play. They did not even tell me that I could join some other team if they did not like me. I was kept hanging till the third match when I had no option but to opt out of the show. Also, even after this man kept at his abusive behaviour, no one stepped in for quite some time to stop the fight. I have realised that actors are vulnerable to such situations. The incident has made me realise that people are only bothered about capturing drama for their cameras. Some of my friends did not help me. Basically, I have learnt 
 that we can’t expect the industry’s support when we 
 face injustice.”
  On the other hand,  , co-owner   feels that the issue has been blown out of proportion. He says, “These are regular issues that happen every day in cricket teams. What happens between them is not our concern. And yes, we are obviously interested in capturing interesting moments on camera, because it is a show after all. If the team did not select Kanwar to play, it must be a decision they took, not us.”
