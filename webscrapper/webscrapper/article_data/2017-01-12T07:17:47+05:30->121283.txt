MUMBAI: The degree distribution function in city   will be delayed by at least a week this year.

 Usually, colleges are allowed to hold the ceremony immediately after   holds its convocation day. While the university has scheduled its   on January 16—Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao and industrialist Mukesh Ambani are likely to be the guests — colleges may to be allowed to hold their events from January 25.
 
 Sources said the function dates may have been pushed back this year as   have been added on degree certificates to crack down on fake document rackets, which has delayed the printing process. But Deepak Wasave, in-charge controller of examinations, claimed there is no delay. “We will ensure that all colleges get their certificates before the varsity's scheduled time. The dates will be finalized in a day or two.” 
 
 MA Khan, registrar of the university, said, “The university, in collaboration with National Securities Depository Ltd, is printing quick response (QR) codes on degrees wherein details of students can be verified by scanning the code using a mobile app.” But an MU official pointed out that th-ere could be a delay in getting the new certificates printed with the QR codes as it has been outsourced to a new firm.
 
 In 2015,   at colleges was introduced and principals were asked to hold their events on the same day as the university’s convocation day; one additional day was given at a later stage. But this year, principals are yet to be informed when to hold their events. “As colleges are expected to invite a chief guest, it would be better to know the dates in advance. The varsity usually gives us the date by December-end or the first week of January,” said a principal.
