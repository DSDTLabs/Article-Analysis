INDORE: The   at mall in   area, where a nine-year-old girl was raped, has been sealed by officials on Friday morning. 

 “We’ve sealed the gaming zone on fourth floor of the mall and it will remain close for a few days until the proceedings take place,” said Tukoganj police station in-charge Rajkumar Yadav. 
 
 He said that accused  , 19, a resident of Panchsheel Nagar, was produced before the court and sent to jail on Friday. Soon after the incident, the mall owner also cancelled agreement of gaming zone. 
 
 Police said that verification of the accused was not done by the agency that hired him. Though, police did not find any past records against him. 
 
 They said that gaming zone manager should have made security arrangements for children who come there regularly. This has happened only because of lackadaisical attitude of manager, said the officials. 
 
 “We have issued a showcause notice to the manager. The owner of the mall has also been asked to give details of gaming zone and its working,” said Yadav. 
 
 DIG Harinarayanachari Mishra issued notices to all security agencies across the city warning them of strict action if the verification of employees is not done. “It is important to check the antecedents of the workers before hiring them. Action will be initiated against the employers if this aspect is found to be neglected,” he said. 
 
 Accused Arjun Rathore had taken the 9-year-old to a secluded corner of the gaming zone and apparently penetrated her private parts, causing her to bleed. This is the second such incident of sexual harassment at the same mall. Some time ago, police had arrested an accused for making objectionable video of a girl in the changing room of a store.
