PUNE: The story will now probably never be known. Shortly after Thursday midnight, two unidentified men bludgeoned the man to death with a cement block. 

 The police later identified the man as   (65), who was living on the pavement for the last five years. "Bali died of multiple head injuries around 3.30am at the   general hospital," said Cantonment police's senior inspector Vasant  .
 
 Local residents and some policemen said Bali had told them in the past that he had taken voluntary retirement from the army as an officer after 17 years in service. When contacted, an army officer who did not wish to be named said, "It would be difficult to confirm whether he or not he was in the army without checking the records."
 
 A senior police officer said, "In September last year, two men had admitted Bali to an old age home. However, he did not like the place and returned to his tent on the pavement. Interestingly, Bali had then approached the Cantonment police and insisted that a kidnapping complaint be registered against the two men. The duo was summoned but they told police that they only got Bali admitted to the old age home for better care. No FIR was registered. Bali told the police that he was a military officer but could not produce any document in support of his claim."
 
 Kunvar said, "A security guard, Sagar Waghmare (25), saw one of the two assailants attacking the victim on the head with a cement block. He told the police that the duo sped away on a scooter towards East Street." 
 
 "We have registered Waghmare's complaint under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code," Kunvar said.
 
 Bali's body has been kept in a morgue as his relatives, when contacted in Kota, Rajasthan, refused to claim it. He has no relative in Pune, Kunvar added.
