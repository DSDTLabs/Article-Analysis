NEW DELHI:   Saxena is contemplating ways to ensure that his son,  , lives on in the memory of others. 

 He is planning to   a trust in the name of Ankit that will help   secure their future.
 
 “Ankit was working hard to get into modelling and photography. He was the sole breadwinner of the family. Now, through a trust in his name, I want to help youths of his age who are struggling to make a career,” Saxena said, sitting in his house in Raghuvir Nagar. Ankit (23) was murdered on Thursday by his girlfriend’s family. His family now hopes to generate funds through donations and use that money in sponsoring these youths’ education and job training and even to meet their personal needs. 
 
 Saxena is clueless about how to start the trust. “I don’t have any financial resource even for myself, but I would like to get this message across and may use some of the funds we have already received as financial assistance.” 
 
 Ankit’s childhood friends, who are already running a social media page in his memory, have planned to use YouTube to promote the idea. 
 
 Recalling the fateful evening, Saxena said he had repeatedly requested the girl’s parents to come to their house and resolve the matter peacefully through dialogue, but they didn’t listen. 
 
 “I was sitting in our flat with my wife when someone came and told us that Ankit has got into a fight on the main road. We went there and saw my son being held by three people.” Saxena said he told the girl’s father that “he is insulting his own daughter by creating such a scene in front of everyone”. 
 
 The devastated father said he and his wife had even gone to Dehradun two weeks ago to meet the family of a prospective bride for Ankit.
