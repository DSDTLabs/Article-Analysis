Kolkata: The national green tribunal’s ( ) eastern zone bench on Wednesday directed the West Bengal State coastal zone management authority (WBSCZMA) to prepare the coastal regulation zone map for the   within three months. 

 While the Sunderbans came under the CRZ in 1999, no map has been prepared for its management as yet. For years now, the state government and Centre have been blaming each other for the delay. Recently, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change handed over all details to the WBSCZMA and the bench of Justice S P Wangdi and professor P C Mishra granted it three months to prepare the map. 
 
 The green bench, that took up the Sunderbans issue suo motu after TOI’s report on degradation of the mangroves, also expressed displeasure at the manner in which large and medium-sized tourist vessels are plying in the eco-sensitive zone without any checks. Environment activist Subhas Datta, who is amicus curiae in the matter, pointed out that some tourist vessels ply on the Sunderbans without bothering about emissions or disposal of solid waste. In April, 2016, the West Bengal pollution control board (WBPCB) had reported M V Paramahansa dumps untreated waste in the waters.
 
 The NGT directed the inland waterways department to find out whether such vessels cause any noise, air or water pollution. Steps for solid waste management are also to be chalked out. The bench also asked the WBPCB why these vessels should not be asked to operate only after seeking consent from the pollution watchdog.
