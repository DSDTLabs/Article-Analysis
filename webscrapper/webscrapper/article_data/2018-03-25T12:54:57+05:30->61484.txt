GUWAHATI: Days after the inquiry committee constituted by the Assam Higher Secondary Education Council (AHSEC) to investigate allegations of paper   in the Class XII state board exams recommended that re-examinations are held for three science subjects, top   officials told TOI that the unholy nexus between unscrupulous council employees and some private education institutions has become a major cause of concern. 

 AHSEC will take a final call on the inquiry committee's recommendation in its executive council meeting on March 29.
 
 "Even after a series of meetings were held to discuss the allegations, we could not identify any major loopholes in the way the   is conducted by AHSEC. However, we are certain that some board insiders are responsible for leaking out the questions for the physics, chemistry and mathematics papers. As the papers of the Science Academy, Goalpara matched almost 100% with the original papers, the council has brought the custodians under the scanner," a top official of the AHSEC told TOI on Saturday.
 
 Though AHSEC did not put on the blame on the then exam in-charge   directly, he was surprisingly removed from the post following protests. The council has, however, refused to accept that there has been any paper leak and has repeatedly dismissed the allegations.
