Actress   has been choosing varied characters of late and her latest venture Chippy has her playing a single mother.
The movie, which is directed by  , is about a bunch of kids who make a short film revolving around their sordid experiences in life.
 Srinda plays Shobha, the mother of one of the kids. “Her character is someone who endures all hardships of life and manages to face each adversity with a smile,” says the director.
 
 However, during the course of life, she understands that nothing is permanent. “She loses her husband, her sole source of livelihood — her hens, and eventually her home,” explains Pradeep.
 
 For money, she is even forced to cut down and sell a tree, that the kids dearly call acha maram. “The grief-stricken children ask her if she will sell them too,” says the director, adding that Shobha is ultimately forced to seek shelter with the young ones in a local school. That’s when the children decide to take a short film based on her adversities, for which they ask Shruti Menon’s character to play Shobha.
 
 On choosing Srinda for the role, the director says, “I instantly liked her performance in 1983. Though her character is depicted with a tinge of humour, you feel sympathy for her as a mother. That’s when I knew she could carry off the role of the mother in my film convincingly.”
