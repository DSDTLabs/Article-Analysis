NEW DELHI: A day after the   rejected AAP’s demand that it be allowed to tamper with the EVM motherboard, the party said the commission has backed out of hackathon. 

 “It is being projected that   has backed out of the hackathon. It is not us;   has backed out of the challenge,” deputy CM   said on Friday.
 
 In a letter to EC, AAP said “Why is the Election Commission running away from organising a no-holds-barred hackathon?”
 
 Having objected to the rules and regulations, AAP is not likely to participate in the   challenge scheduled for June 3. The last date to participate in the exercise expired on Friday.
 
 “What is hackathon? It is not a magic that somebody will hack a machine with some mantras. It is a science. You are not allowing us to open the machine and take tools to the place where EVMs will be kept, but you are allowing us to hack the machine,” Sisodia said.
 
 He added hacking can be attempted only with tools and by accessing the parts of the machine.
 
 “In a hackathon, hackers are invited to test the security of any system using any tool available. Such ethical hacking is to help understand the loopholes so that they can be removed in future,” AAP’s national secretary Pankaj Gupta said in a note to EC. 
 
 AAP alleged that in store rooms (where EVMs are stored in non-election period), EVMs were tampered to rig elections. “The EVMs, which are sent to polling centres, do not come from EC office. They are sent from store rooms where engineers go to maintain them and it is there that tampering takes place,” Gopal Rai, AAP Delhi’s convener said.
