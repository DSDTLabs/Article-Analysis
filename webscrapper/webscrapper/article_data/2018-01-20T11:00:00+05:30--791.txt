 is at the center of controversy after he was quoted in a recent interview saying that he is happy that Vidya did not play   as sexuality would have crept in…

 The filmmaker who is currently at the post production of Aami, the biopic of veteran writer  , cleared the air on the hullaballoo revolved around the statement.
 
  “The whole thing happened when two statements which were said in two different contexts were put together. One was made while talking about the sexuality of Madhavikutty and the other while mentioning the writer’s innocence. By combining the two, it was interpreted that I have portrayed Madhavikutty in my movie as an innocent village girl. In reality, I had never meant that.”
 
 He added, “Aami has tried to bring out Madhavikutty, the writer who was the heartthrob of all Malayalis, with all the nuances of her character and persona. It throws light on the innocent Madhavikutty who has all the characteristics of a Malayali who speaks Malayalam fluently and lives as one. At the same time, it also showcases the revolutionary Madhavikutty who dared to talk about the sexual desires and needs of women and questioned the patriarchal mind set of Malayalis, their concepts of morality and hypocrisy.”
