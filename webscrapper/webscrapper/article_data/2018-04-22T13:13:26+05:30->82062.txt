THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the   party   deciding to follow a soft approach toward the Congress party in its fight against the Modi government,   state president Kumanam Rajasekharan here on Saturday demanded that the CPM and the Congress should field a joint candidate in the upcoming Chengannur byelection.

 “The Hyderabad party Congress of the CPM has officially unveiled the compromise politics between the CPM and the Congress. If the CPM is earnest about its new political resolution, the Marxist party should field a joint candidate at Chengannur. Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and   should hold discussions in open. They should stop the practice of vote trade and fight the BJP by fielding a joint candidate. Both the parties should put an end to their practice of fooling the public,” Kummanam told reporters here on Saturday.
 
 Kummanam said the CPM should openly tell people the reasons that forced them to support the Congress. “The CPM should tell people; which policy of the Congress has attracted them towards that party. It should also reveal the difference between ‘understanding’ and alliance,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala termed the CPM decision as a wise one which dawned late on the party. It’s the narrow vision of Kerala leaders that created these many controversies regarding the association with the Congress, he said.
 
 “It’s the state leaders’ failure to look at the country beyond Kerala that created this much fuss over the Congress connection. The Congress stands for a secular alliance against the   and the BJP. It’s up to the CPM to decide on its stand,” he said.
