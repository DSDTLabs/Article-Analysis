Bengaluru: A BBMP move to pulp kitchen and food waste and let it go down the drain by introducing pulverizers in households and hotels has run into resistance from an online petition.  The petition was filed on Tuesday on e-portal Change.org by Bengaluru Eco Club, a group of citizens working on finding environment-friendly solutions to the city’s garbage woes. By evening, the petition, which has been addressed to the BBMP commissioner and the mayor, got 220 signatures. The BBMP recently proposed to promote pulverizers as a solution for the city’s wet waste. A pulverizer is a small electric grinder machine and the Palike wanted households to use it to grind food and kitchen waste and dump the liquid generated into the sink.  The petition stated that food waste would consume a lot of fresh water before it could be turned into liquid form to go down the drain. This could lead to flooding in the city. “When drains are blocked with food sludge, flooding will increase multifold. Raw sewage will emerge out of manholes and flow on roads. When pipes are blocked, raw sewage will burst out of manholes and flow freely across roads. The raw sewage will reach drains and lakes,” it added. Vani Murthy from Malleswaram, who pioneered the Swaccha Gruha initiative by educating the public on home composting, said pulverizer is a terrible idea. “That’s not a solution at all. Not only will we lose a good resource for composting, the drains will get clogged with food waste,” said Vani, who signed the petition.  Asked about the slurry from food waste possibly blocking drains, he said these issues will be looked into by the expert committee. “The width of drains need to be changed and STPs have to handle the slurry. Pulveriser is just one of the ideas that we are considering,” he said.
