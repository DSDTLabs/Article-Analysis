VISAKHAPATNAM: After an overwhelming response to PM Narendra Modiâ€™s request to citizens to give up their LPG subsidy, consumer rights activists have urged the Union government to provide a facility to people that would allow them to voluntarily   their quota of rice from Fair Price Shops, without forgoing their ration cards.

 In a petition submitted here on Sunday, activists led by Kandregula Venkata Raman submitted a petition to the state civil   minister, Prathipati   Rao, seeking the same to reduce illegal hoarding of rice. 
 
 Venkata Raman, in his petition, observed that such an option could be introduced either through an application or an option provided on the   supplies website.
 
 Venkata Raman also mentioned concerns over proper implementation of Food Security Act in the petition. Venkata Raman observed that as per government order number-16, 6-07-2015, the government must appoint committees in every district and mandal, consisting of representatives of Ration Shop dealers, nodal/appellate authorities and revenue department officials to receive petitions (grievance).
 
 The petition also dealt with the immediate provision of ration in case of place change and transfer. The petitioners also sought help from the government to promote and establish consumer clubs across the state to help generate awareness about consumer law. The petition totally dealt with 52 major and minor points regarding the supply of essential commodities.
 
 One of the major points raised in the petition was the request urging the government to keep out the   (GCC) from supplying essential commodities in the Agency areas and instead the government to do it. The petitioners alleged that there was much to be desired in the manner in which the GCC was functioning.
