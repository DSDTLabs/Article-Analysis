Hyderabad: With the new Goods and Services Tax regime set to be rolled out in July this year, around 87% of central excise active assessees as well as 84% of service tax assessees have migrated to the new   platform in the state, said M Srinivas, commissioner (customs, central excise & service tax, Hyderabad-III) on Friday. Speaking at the National Conference on `GST Law and its impact on Industry’ organised by industry body Assocham and Ftapcci, Srinivas said that the state is pulling out all the stops to reach out to industries and help them switch over to the new tax regime. Around 60,000 people have already been trained and the master training programme for key tax personnel is also underway. Ftapcci president Ravindra Modi said it has conducted three outreach programmes on GST and has been able to help over 600 industries understand the nitty gritties of the new tax regime. “We have reached out to authorities stating that in the initial phase they must be a bit lenient towards small industries because many do not have the wherewithal to be fully complaint with the new GS platform.”
