SALEM: Stacks of shredded fake   notes of demonetised Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 were found to be disposed of in a   bin placed just opposite to the government hospital in Edappadi here on Wednesday.

 The notes, people said, were torn into pieces. “The miscreant(s) who disposed of the notes seem(s) to have first torn the notes and then crushed it in a machine,” said K Munusamy, one of the villagers.
 
 It was local residents who first spotted the torn currency notes in the bin. As the news spread, large crowds gathered at the spot and some tried to collect the pieces from the bin. In the melee followed, the bin collapsed and the torn pieces of currency notes were scattered around.
 
 When alerted, the Edappadi police rushed to the spot. Seeing the cops, some miscreants fled the spot with a handful of currency waste. The police, subsequently, packed the torn currency notes in a polythene bag and took it to the station.
 
 The police said they would hand over the torn currency notes to revenue officials for further action.
 
 Preliminary investigations revealed that they were fake currency notes. “Some miscreant(s) might have torn the currency notes after his/their attempt to exchange them for new currencies failed,” revenue officials said.
 
 Further investigation was on to nab the miscreant(s) involved in this, the officials said.
