AHMEDABAD: The state government on Sunday announced its 31-day water conservation drive called ‘Sujalam Sufalam Jal Abhiyan’. The campaign will be launched on “Gujarat Gaurav Din” on May 1, which is the foundation day of   state. Moreover, the government aims to revive 32 rivers in the state.

 The campaign will see de-silting and reviving of existing   by excavating them so that they collect more rainwater. Chief minister Vijay Rupani, who made the announcement on Sunday, said that the plan was to harvest as much as 11,000 lakh cubic feet of rainwater — which will not only help in irrigation but will also help raise groundwater tables. 
 
 Rupani and deputy CM Nitin Patel will launch the campaign by participating in a pond recharge at Kosamdi village in Ankleshwar on May 1. Rupani said that over 4,000 earthmovers, and over 8,000 tractors and dumpers will be pressed into the service. 
 
 The campaign will be undertaken under “Jan Bhagidari” — state and citizens will contribute equally. Chief secretary J N Singh said, “Collectors and DDOs will control and maintain two separate accounts — one for contribution from citizens and under CSR, the other will be a government account. The payments will be cleared by collectors.” 
 
 When reminded of recent Khet-Talavdi or farm ponds scam by Gujarat State Land Development Corporation (GSLDC) unearthed in Panchmahals and Rapar in Bhuj, Rupani said, “We will ensure that our activities on ground and Sujalam-Sufalam account books are audited by CAG while citizens accounts are audited by a competent auditing firm. We won’t tolerate corruption.” 
 
 Under NAREGA, as many as 10,570 earthworks will be done, with deepening of 6,260 lakes and check-dams, and construction of 886 check-dams, 567 Pala (earthen walls), gabion walls.
