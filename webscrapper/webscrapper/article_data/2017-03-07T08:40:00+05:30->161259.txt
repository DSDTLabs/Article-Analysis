NEW DELHI:   will release their first list of children selected for   on Tuesday.

 Parents are waiting for the list eagerly, especially after the neighbourhood criteria initially prescribed by the government was scrapped by the Delhi high court, and schools were asked to make admissions on the basis of their own standard. 
 
 Many parents in the city had selected schools on the basis of the neighbourhood criteria that was prepared by the government, despite knowing that the criteria on the basis of which admissions are to be made was subject to change.
 
 The HC had passed the interim verdict in favour of the schools on the last day of submission of forms, leaving the parents in a soup.
 
 Pooja Kumar, a parent living in Yojna Vihar, told TOI she had filled out all forms on the basis of the neighbourhood criteria, but following the HC verdict, her chances to gain admission anywhere looked bleak.
 
 Parents, in a last ditch effort to make sure their childâ€™s name figures somewhere, have also made efforts to secure seats through management quota.
 
 The second list of candidates is expected to be out by March 17. Until then, the details of each selected candidate under the first list will be displayed and open for scrutiny by parents who can approach schools for any doubts on the way their wards have been allotted points. The admission process ends on March 31.
