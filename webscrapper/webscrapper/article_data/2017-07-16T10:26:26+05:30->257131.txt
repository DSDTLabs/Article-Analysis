PUNE: Uruguayan striker   will continue his association with   after agreeing to sign for   for this season. But in doing so, he has forsaken the chance of playing under Diego  .

 After leaving   last season, Alfaro joined UAE Division One club   and helped them to a fourth place finish after scoring eight goals in 12 games. The club then surprisingly appointed the legendary Maradona as their manager for the upcoming season after a failure to finish in the top-two promotion spots, but Alfaro had already made up his mind.
 
 "Diego signed for the club for next season and I did not meet him during my stint. The club had not revealed their plans for next season and during that time, I had this opportunity of coming back to play in the   with Pune and I did not want to miss that chance," he said.
 
 The 29-year-old had a successful stint with NorthEast United FC last year scoring five goals in 13 appearances for the Highlanders. But he is now looking forward to a new challenge in a new city.
 
 "Pune had been interested in me for a while now. They have a really good project so I want to help them do well in the next season," he told TOI."I know Pune is a fantastic city and the coach ( ) has also spoken to me of his plans."
 
 The ISL will now be held over six months as compared to three in the previous three editions. Alfaro believes that longer duration of the league will benefit Indian football and continue its growth.
 
 "The only difference between last season and this season will be the number of games," he said. "The ISL is a very well organized league and I hope it continues to grow and keep increasing in duration every year as that will help Indian football."
 
 Having amassed over a decade of experience playing in his native Uruguay, Italy and the Middle-East, Alfaro will certainly add firepower to an FC Pune City side which struggled for goals last season. They will hope his goals can propel them to a first-ever top 4 finish, if not more.
