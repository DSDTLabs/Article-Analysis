MUMBAI: The eastern water front, which will undergo a major revamp, will have a promenade thrice the length of  . Mumbai Port Trust ( ) has decided to create a recreation zone on its port land, for which a master plan is being prepared.

 Union minister Nitin  , who was in Mumbai to hand over 165 dormitories for accommodation of outstation children treated for cancer, said, “We are preparing plans for the revamp of port land and the promenades will be three times the length of Marine Drive.” The length of Marine Drive is 3.6km. 
 
 MBPT chairman Sanjay Bhatia said, “The promenade will be broader and it will be close to a central   four times the size of Oval Maidan.” Another official said the promenade will be supplemented by cycling tracks.
 
 MbPT had appointed a consortium, which designed the Sabarmati waterfront, to prepare a master plan for the revamp of the eastern water front into a hub of tourism, recreation and entertainment under the self-financing model, through commercial exploitation of land, in November 2016. The consultant will start work on the draft plan for 550ha within six months. Of this, 300ha is available but the detailed master plan for 165ha will be ready in nine months.
 
 MbPT wants the consultant to create a landmark site for Mumbai and India, with plazas and shopping arcades, and a pedestrian and bicycle-friendly environment. The revamp will be carried out on land where non-port activities are undertaken, to the north of Ferry Wharf. Since it is being carried out under the self-financing model, MbPT will monetise the land so that another central business district can come up on the lines of Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC).
