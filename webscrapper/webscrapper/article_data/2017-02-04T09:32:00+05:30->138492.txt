KOLHAPUR: The   (KMC) has started the election process for hawkers’ representatives in the town  .

 The state government had issued a notification, drafting rules for street vendors under Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending Act, 2014. Under this act, it is compulsory for civic bodies to set up town vending committees by electing hawkers’ representatives. To ensure a fair election, the KMC is going to count the hawkers across the city.
 
 Pramod Barale, chief estate officer of the KMC, said, “The committee will be deciding the hawking and no-hawking zones. Hawkers will get adequate representation in the committee through an election.”
 
 As per a survey conducted by the KMC in 2012, the city has 8,600 hawkers but, the number could be at least 30% more now. The civic body will publish a list of hawkers three months prior to election. Candidates contesting the election should be a member of the association duly registered with the competent authority.
 
 “The nomination will be scrutinised by independent authorities. The elected representatives will have complete say in deciding the hawking and no-hawking zones. We are going to appoint a government consultant to conduct a survey of hawkers. The survey will be completed in six months,” Barale said.
