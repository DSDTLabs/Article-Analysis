Gurgaon:   will be cut off in large parts of Gurgaon on Thursday and Friday as   to shift the pipeline at   and  , where underpasses are being built.

 The development authority will shut down its water treatment plant in Basai for 24 hours. The master pipeline connected to the Basai plant, which supplies water to large parts of the city, will have to be shifted, as it is coming in the alignment of the underpasses that are under construction. It will be jointly shifted by Huda and NHAI, which is constructing the underpasses.
 
 “We have already laid an alternative pipeline, which now needs to be connected with the Basai plant,” said sub-divisional engineer Vijendra Mallik.
 
 The master pipeline from the Basai plant, passing through Hero Honda Chowk and Rajiv Chowk, goes to Sector 16 boosting station. It supplies around 22 million gallons per day (MGD) and fulfils water requirements of Zone-II — sectors 14, 15 (I and II), 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, DLF phases and Sushant Lok. Private colonies around MG Road and various malls also get supply from the pipeline. “We need to connect the newly-laid pipeline at four different places — two each at Rajiv Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk — for which, we need at least 24 hours,” said Mallik.
 
 Huda will supply water till Wednesday, after which supply will be resumed on Friday evening. Normally, Huda supplies water twice a day. “We request people to use water judiciously and store it to avoid inconvenience,” the engineer said.
 
 The city needs 90 MGD of water, of which 70 MGD is supplied by the Basai plant, while the remaining 20 MGD comes from the Chandu Budhera plant.
