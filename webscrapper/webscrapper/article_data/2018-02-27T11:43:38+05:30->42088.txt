PANAJI: The   arbitration tribunal has directed the Goa government’s power department to pay Rs 292 crore outstanding dues to   Infrastructure by April 15, the company said on Monday.

 In the order passed on February 16, the tribunal also said the state government would have to pay 15% interest per annum if it failed to pay Rs 292 crore by the stipulated date, the company said in a statement.
 
 State power minister Pandurang Madkaikar acknowledged the adverse verdict, but said the state would challenge the order in the higher court. “There are strong grounds for us to win the case and we are going in appeal in the higher court,” Madkaikar told TOI.
 
 The power company said the need for arbitration arose “due to prolonged non-payment of dues” by the state government towards supply of electricity by Reliance Infrastructure from its 48MW power plant at Sancoale.
 
 “The total outstanding dues along with interest as on October 31, 2017, amount to Rs 278 crore. The tribunal has also awarded Reliance Infrastructure interest from October 2017 till the date of the award, which amounts to Rs 14 crore,” the company said.
 
 Madkaikar disagreed and said the state had strong grounds for terminating the contract since Reliance Infrastructure had charged a higher tariff than the one agreed upon in the agreement.
 
 The company said the tribunal, which is constituted by the joint electricity regulatory commission, upheld its contention that the rate of energy for the period from June 2013 to August 2014 was based on the varying prices of fuel and dollar exchange rate as was agreed to by the Goa government.
 
 Reliance Infrastructure is one of India’s largest infrastructure companies, having developed projects in several high growth sectors such as power, roads, defence manufacturing and Metro Rail, and is also a leading power utility.
