Derek Walcott, the mighty poet and playwright who penned “A Far Cry From Africa” is no more with us. 

  The   poet was aged 87 and passed away at his home in St Lucia after a long illness. His death was confirmed by his publisher, Farrar, Straus and Giroux. No cause was given, but he had been in poor health for some time, the publisher said.
 
  The poet had won the   for   in 1992 and the   in 2011. The Nobel committee had presented the award to Walcott "for a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment". The citation continued, “In his literary works Walcott has laid a course for his own cultural environment, but through them he speaks to each and every one of us. In him, West Indian culture has found its great poet.”
 
  Walcott’s poetry centres around his life in   in the Caribbean, and with the complex colonialist legacy that created his world. His poems and plays contains multitudes, and illustrates multifarious manifestations as outcomes of a colonial regime. His compact yet dreamy poetry has a dazzling musicality and lyricism. Walcott’s voice, in all his writing, demanded to be heard, in all its sensuous immediacy and historical complexity. 
 
  Walcott himself had said once, “For every poet, it is always morning in the world,” he said. “History a forgotten, insomniac night; History and elemental awe are always our early beginning, because the fate of poetry is to fall in love with the world, in spite of History.”
