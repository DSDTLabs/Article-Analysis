HYDERABAD: Nine thousand hostellers of   ( ) can breathe easy as 21 hostels will get uninterrupted water supply from November this year once the 5ML capacity reservoir being built by HMWS & SB is ready by that time.

 
 The water board is pushing ahead to complete the works on the 5 ML ground-level service reservoir at a cost of Rs 5 crore within seven months. The new service reservoir has been necessitated after the existing service reservoirs on the HMWS&SB premises in   — constructed five decades ago — have almost gone kaput.
 
  
  
 
 “We got an extent of 1,800 square yards of OU’s land on lease for 10 years to set up the new reservoir,” general manager, HMWS&SB, D Sudarshan told TOI. After the university handed over the land, the water board called for the tenders and kicked off the work. “We are spending Rs 5 crore on the reservoir. We are currently supplying 1,000 kilo litres (1 million litres per day) as assured quantity on a daily basis to meet the demand of those staying in the hostels,” he said.
 
 The water board used to operate tankers to overcome the drinking water crisis in the varsity. “Once the new reservoir is commissioned, we will be able to supply 24/7 water to all the hostel inmates,” a senior official averred.
 
 Apart from the piped water, the campus also gets water from borewells.
 
 It may be recalled angry students had conducted protests on the campus some time back when the water crisis was severe.
 
 “Despite bountiful rain and enough levels in the drinking water sources, we used to get water at a very low pressure. With HMWS & SB’s initiative, we hope to see a lasting solution to the water woes on the campus,” said a hostel inmate.
