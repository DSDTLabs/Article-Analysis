JHARGRAM: A day after foresters installed twin cages to trap the tiger recently photographed in a   forest, reports of fresh   came from the forest of Shiarboni in Gurguripal — 35 kilometres from Lalgarh — on Sunday night. A senior forest official only said that they were heading to the spot to check the pug marks. 

 If at all it’s a tiger, then there’s possibility that the big cat is moving towards the corridors between   and Dalma.
 
 Meanwhile, the fear factor is back in the once-Red zone Lalgarh. A herd of 16 Dalma elephants also raided a few villages on the edge of the forest on Sunday morning. A 45-year-old woman,  , was injured after being attacked by an elephant as she came in its way at Lalitasole. 
 
 The herd roaming the forest where the tiger had been photographed also damaged two camera traps laid in search of the big cat. The tiger was yet to be caught in any of the trap cages till Sunday evening, said a forester. No fresh pug marks or photograph of the big cat have been found in Lalgarh in last two days. 
 
 Though questions are being raised if elephants’ presence has anything to do with the tiger’s movement, experts said in forests like Corbett, Kaziranga, Nagarhole and even Simlipal tigers and elephants share the same landscape.
