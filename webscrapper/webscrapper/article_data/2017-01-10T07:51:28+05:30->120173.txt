BATHINDA: Family members of the   (PoW) of 1971 Surjit Singh of Tehna village, supported by Faridkot residents, on Monday started signature campaign to prepare a charter to be sent to the Union government to take up matter with   for his release along with other PoWs still languishing in   for over four and a half decades.

 Surjit’s son Amrik Singh said, “Five persons from Punjab, including my father, are languishing in Kot Lakhpat jail at Lahore in Pakistan but the Union government is doing nothing to secure their release. We have met Union foreign affairs minister   but to no avail. Concerned over that, we started a signature campaign along with members of NGOs and the charter will be presented to the government soon.”
 
 Amrik said that apart from his father, who was a constable in Border Security Force (BSF), Balwinder Singh of Chabba village in Tarn Taran, Vir Singh of Khurd Khaira village in Mansa, Jugraj Singh of Jeeda village in Bathinda and Dharam Pal of Lehra Dhurkot village in Bathinda were lodged in Pakistani jails.
 
 He said Surjit was taken hostage by Pakistan Rangers on December 4, 1971, from Poonch sector in Jammu and Kashmir and was taken to Pakistan as a PoW. After decades, his family had got to know that Surjit was lodged in Kot Lakhpat jail when one Satish Kumar, who was released by Pakistan authorities, had apprised them about him. “Lekhu Ram of Sri Ganganagar in Rajasthan, who was released from a Pakistani jail, had told us that he had met Surjit in 2010,” said Amrik.
