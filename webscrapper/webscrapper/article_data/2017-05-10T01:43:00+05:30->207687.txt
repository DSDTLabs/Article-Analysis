Chennai: After confirming the involvement of ministers and high ranking officials in dealings with sand mining baron  , the   is awaiting responses from foreign countries where Karuru-based businessman   is said to have invested in financial institutions, real estate sector and local businesses. 

 “We have more or less completed the probe into his businesses as well as assessed the total tax evasion with regard to his Indian business. Some big names are involved in the business with Anbunathan,” said an I-T official. 
 
 “We learnt about Anbunathan’s investments outside India while perusing documents seized from his house and other places. He has admitted to the investments made abroad mostly in banks, local businesses, real estate and in financial institutions. But, we have not got any reply from these concerns abroad,” said the official. Anbunathan has invested mostly in south-east countries, he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, two state ministers on Tuesday denied reports that the I-Tax department had conveyed to the government about some ministers and officials allegedly being beneficiaries of Sekhar Reddy’s largesses. “It is totally wrong. It is a rumour spread by some people,” finance minister D Jayakumar told reporters.
 
 TOI had reported that the IT department had forwarded to the state government a list of the names of some ministers and officials figured in Reddy’s diary.
 
 Law Minister C V Shanmugam too dismissed the reports and sought to turn heat on rebel leader O Panneerselvam. Shanmugam asked as to why an investigation was not demanded in respect of the former chief minister's alleged links with Reddy when a probe was sought based on “some entries in a diary” made by some “Tom, Dick and Harry.”
