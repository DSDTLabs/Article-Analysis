 Trichy: Federation of Consumers and Service Organizations has condemned the state governmentâ€™s decision to increase Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol to 34 percent from 27 and on diesel to 25 percent from 21.43 percent. They have also decided to stage a series of protests till the hike is roll backed.
 
 The decision was arrived at during an urgent meeting held here on Monday, headed by M Sekaran, president of the association. They also discussed long pending projects including the integrated bus stand and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). 
 
 According to members of the federation, petrol prices have gone up by Rs3.78 per litre and Rs1.70 for diesel in Chennai. The hike would lead to the escalation of essential commodities at a time when the state general budget is going to be tabled soon. So, the state government should roll back VAT immediately. 
 
 Another resolution said that the state government should continue to distribute pulses at ration shops. The distribution of pulses had stopped for the past two months. Members of the association unanimously agreed on the urgent need to establish the integrated bus terminal in the outskirts of the city. They also urged the Union government to exempt Tamil Nadu from the NEET exams as it would affect students hailing from rural pockets. 
 
 They have decided to stage a series of protests in support of various resolutions taken during the meeting.
