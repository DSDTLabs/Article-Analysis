ALLAHABAD: The seers delivering religious discourses and imparting meditation and yoga training to pilgrims at the ongoing Magh Mela are well educated and some are even professionally qualified. A strong yearning for inner peace and salvation prodded them into the world of spiritualism and now they help and guide others attain inner peace and satisfaction.

 Dr   of   and Radha Satyam of   are imparting spiritual lessons to devotees at their camps, and while the former holds a law degree and has done PhD, the latter is a doctor.
 
 Radhacharya, who had practised law in Supreme Court, says “After completing my PhD and law, I took up a job in 1999 for some time, but realized that meditation is the key to salvation. Highly educated people come to me and ask how to attain peace of mind. I advise them to start meditation and yoga.”
 
 Radha Satyam, who left medicine in 1992 and became spiritual guru, too advocates adopting meditation and yoga for a stress-free, healthy life. She says, “Medicine cures you on the outer level, but meditation and yoga benefit and cure from inside. They give a new lease of life.”
 
 Radha Satyam worked as a gynaecologist at a city hospital before she moved on to yoga and meditation.
 
 Anand Giri, head of Shri Ganga Sena, holds post-graduate degrees in yoga and jyotish separately. “Spirituality guides how to lead a good and healthy life. Hundreds of distressed people come and seek to know about ‘dharm’ (religion) and ‘karma’ (deed),” says Giri, a katha-vachak (story teller).
 
 Similarly, Anshuman Ji Maharaj, who has done BTech in computer science and MBA, religious discourses and guides devotees to understand the real meaning of life.
 
 Swami Premanand, who did MCA in 1993, has his camp on the banks of Ganga. “After a stage in life, people seek peace of mind and yearn for salvation. Only spiritualism and yoga can help them attain their goals,” he said.
