SILCHAR: National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Reformation), a Nagaland-based outfit, has reportedly launched an extortion drive in the tribal villages of Cachar and Dima Hasao districts. 

 NSCN (R), which was formed in April 2015 after its leaders broke away with NSCN (K), has delivered demand notes with letterheads saying 'NSCN (R), Government of the Peoples Republic of Nagaland'. The letters have been delivered to the village headmen of a number of villages in  , Fulertal, Hmarkhawlien of Cachar and Jinam valley areas of Dima Hasao.
 
 The outfit has demanded a sum of Rs 7 lakh from each of the village headman. "In the letter they have asked us to collect the money from villagers and hand them over within two months", said a headman. "We are helpless, because the villagers are too poor to give the money. We are passing sleepless nights', he said.
 
 Sources said the armed men have been handing over the extortion notes since June.
 
 Superintendent of police (Cachar)   on Friday said they have got reports of the extortion notes and that senior police officials have been sent to the areas to take stock of the situation. Lakhipur and Joypur police stations have also been alerted, said the SP. Talking to TOI, Raushan said police are yet to locate the villages and speak with the headmen who have got the demand notes. He said security has been tightened in the areas in question. 
 
 Sources said NSCN (R) was formed on April 6, 2015 in Mon district of Nagaland. Y Wangtin   and P  , former members of NSCN (K) had officially announced the formation of the new outfit. 
 
 The decision came after Konyak, a senior 'minister' and personal secretary to Khaplang, and Tikhak, the spokesperson of the outfit, were expelled by Khaplang after misunderstandings arose over the abrogation of ceasefire with the Indian government. The duo had wanted to continue with the ceasefire.
