MUMBAI: BMC’s much-touted 24x7 water supply dream may just not be a reality even for two pilot wards where it has been working since almost four years.   officials at the civic standing committee meeting on Wednesday said that 24x7 water supply project would not mean round-the-clock supply, but only more water than what is currently being supplied.

 Under the   (WDIP) from the year 2014, the BMC had decided to take up two wards on a pilot basis to provide round-the-clock water supply — H west which comprises parts of  , Khar and   — and T ward which includes Mulund. However, corporators said that even four years later, the civic administration is failing to implement the 24x7 water supply for the city. “We want to know from when exactly the city will get 24x7 water supply and what are the reasons for the delay in the project. From the last six years, the BMC mentions this project but the announcement remains only on paper?” asked BJP group leader Manoj Kotak.
 
 Replying to the same, the BMC said that it will target starting the 24x7 water supply project from August 15 this year for the two pilot wards — Bandra and Mulund. However, BMC clarified that 24x7 water supply project would only mean more water than what is currently being supplied.
 
 Meanwhile corporators demanded that BMC work towards providing equitable water to residents across Mumbai and not just certain pockets.
