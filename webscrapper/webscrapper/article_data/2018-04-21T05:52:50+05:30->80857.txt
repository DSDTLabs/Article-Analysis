 NAGPUR: Though emotions play a major role than conscious thoughts, it goes without saying that both — emotional quotient (EQ) and intelligent quotients (IQ) — are closely connected to each other, said  , a consultant psychologist at  , on Friday.
 
 He delivered a lecture on various aspects of EQ and IQ of the human psyche at a daylong workshop titled ‘Emotional intelligence: Assessment of EQ and testing of EPQ’, organized by the psychology department of  .
 
 Bhusari spoke at length about the co-relation between IQ and EQ, saying, “We cannot feel emotions without our cognitive intelligence, and our physical response to a certain situation depends upon this exchange of information that happens inside our intellect.” 
 
 He classified EQ into different parts for a better understanding of emotional intelligence. “EQ largely comprises self-awareness, social skills and self-management dimensions, to name a few. To master emotional intelligent, we need to discipline these dimensions first as they are purely cognitive skills,” he said.
 
 Bhusari spoke on various tests and parameters adopted to test a person’s EQ. “Our cognitive abilities are developed to its full potential by 16 years of age. But the development of our EQ is an ongoing process which affects the everyday life. There are various scales which determine one’s EQ, just like while testing IQ. However, these tests should not be taken before full development of a child’s brain,” Bhusari added.
 
 Bhusari apprised the audience about the other aspects of human psyche like spiritual quotient (SQ) and psychosomatic disorders. The audience was also made to take various EQ tests to know their emotional intelligence.
