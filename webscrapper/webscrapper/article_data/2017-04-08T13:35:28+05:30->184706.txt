PUNE:   deputy governor   on Saturday warned banks that they will be pulled up in the upcoming supervisory cycle if they do not properly adhere to proper base rate reductions and also if they do not operationalise the internal ombudsman scheme.

 Mundra said that banks have been not transparent in passing on the interest rate cuts to borrowers, nor have they migrated majority of loans to marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR). 
 
 He cited an example of a bank (without naming it) which has reduced the MCLR by 105 basis points (bps) in last one year and reduced the base rate by only 10 bps while retaining 70% of customers in the base rate regime. He said it is likely that other banks are following the same.
 
 He also said that one year after the internal ombudsman scheme was proposed many banks -- especially public sector banks -- have not operationalised the scheme. 
 
 "We will take these issues up in the upcoming supervisory cycle and include harsh penal action,"   said.
 
 He also said banks are not supporting micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in times of distress. This even as there is so much potential now to support MSMEs in a growth phase.
 
 "A large number of MSMEs are becoming sick because of banks (attitude), Mundra added.
