VIZAG: The belligerence of   (104, 110 balls, 5x4s, 4x6s) and   (51, 1x4s, 4x6s) helped India Red beat   by 32 runs in the   match here on Sunday.

 Tamil Nadu opener M   (124, 134 balls, 9x4s), too, came up with a superb show, but it wasn't enough for his team to chase down 317 against an experienced India Red bowling attack. With the win India Red have made it to the final, while   face Tamil Nadu in a knock-out match on Monday. 
 
 As many as 12 sixes were hit by India Red, who opted to bat, with Pandey and Axar putting on an exhibition of sensational hitting during their 98-run stand for the fifth wicket in 12.2 overs. On the other hand, TN had only four sixes to their tally. In addition to the massive strikes, some sloppy fielding from TN coupled with wayward bowling (13 wides) enabled Red to post a commanding 316 for eight in 50 overs.
 
 Pandey, who missed the first match on Saturday due to a minor injury, couldn't have found a better time to score his sixth List A century. He had failed to set the stage on fire scoring only one fifty in seven innings in the Vijay Hazare Trophy for Karnataka, but things turned around for the right-hander here.
 
 Shikhar Dhawan, struck a 48-ball 50. Pandey, Axar and Dhawan kept depositing the TN spin trio of R Sai Kishore (460),   (055) and Washington Sundar (161) straight down the ground or over mid-wicket every time the ball was given a bit of air.
