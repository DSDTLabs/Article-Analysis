 Only 24 years old, Daya Yadav, a muscular young man, is instructing his “students” in his akhara — a patch of soft mud in village  , barely 20 km off the   in Agra district. In this village and the neighbouring one, Etmadpur Madra, wrestling has not only been a sport for generations but also a tradition.
 
 Daya says his grandfather and other elders were active   and even claims that   chief Mulayam Singh Yadav used to come here to wrestle with his friends in his heydays. Over the years, however, wrestling took a backseat. Until, of course, Daya realized he had a passion for it.
 
 “I now have a batch of about 30 students who practice here every morning. They have shown extreme dedication and spark. If we continue practise like this, I can assure an Olympic medal or two from this village,” he says proudly.
