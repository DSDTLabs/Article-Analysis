HYDERABAD: The elite anti-Maoist commando unit Greyhounds of Telangana police is in the process of purchasing 300  . 

 The Union ministry of home affairs ( ) had last year given the nod to security units to purchase light-weight bullet-proof helmets. Already, the   and the   ( ) bought them and now the Greyhounds, which pioneered the anti-Maoist operations in the country, also wants to purchase the head gear on a trial basis. 
 
 Initially, the elite force wants to procure 200 helmets, which weigh not more than 1.7 kgs. These helmets would be compatible for mounting night vision and communication devices. 
 
 Each helmet would cost 30,000 and accordingly tenders were floated by Greyhounds officials to supply these customised bullet-proof head gear. Apart from resisting bullets, the helmet would also have padding inside for trauma protection. 
 
 Greyhounds, who played a key role in pushing out Maoists from the state, at times venture into neighbouring states in pursuit of the extremists. Mostly, their operations are based on intelligence inputs in a particular area. As of now, the Greyhounds commandos have not been using bullet proof head gear. 
 
 However, a senior Telangana police officer played it down, claiming Greyhounds seldom carry body protection. "The Greyhounds is more a tactic unit. For various reasons, we do not take much body gear protection. Our approach in handling an operation is completely different from the way other security forces do, which have been handling Maoist activities in other states,'' a source said.
