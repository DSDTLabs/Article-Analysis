VADODARA: A city-based builder lodged a complaint of criminal intimidation against his partner, who once was notorious for his criminal activities, after he threatened to kill him if he did not get his money back. 

 
 However, the complainant   told the police that he had returned Rs 20 lakh to the accused Ghanshyam Fulbaaze, which he had borrowed around two years back.
 
 Police said that Kandoi had borrowed money from Fulbaaze since he was in dire need of money. In return of the cash, he gave two cheques without dates of Rs 10 lakh each to Fulbaaze. 
 
 Kandoi claimed that within a year he returned the money to the accused in different amounts. He later gave another Rs 17 lakh to Fulbaaze for business purpose, but his two cheques were not returned. Instead, Fulbaaze used to go to Kandoi’s house in   and threaten him.
 
 On April 19, when Kandoi was waiting outside a paan shop in Akota, Fulbaaze reached there and started hurling abuses at him. When Kandoi asked him not to use such abusive language in public, Fulbaaze threatened to stab him there if he did not return his money. The paan shop owner and others present there requested the accused to go away from there.
 
 Later,Kandoi gave an application to police commissioner’s office for registering a complaint against Fulbaaze following which a case was registered at   police station on Saturday.
