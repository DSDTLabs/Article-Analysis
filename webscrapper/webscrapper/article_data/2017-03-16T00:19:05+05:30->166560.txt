New Delhi: An assistant sub-inspector was   by a group of six men when he asked them to stop creating a nuisance outside the New Delhi railway   on Monday evening.

 Police said that the men were in an inebriated state at the time of incident and smashed a liquor bottle on the cop’s head, when he refused to listen to them.
 
 The  , Karanveer Singh, was posted at the New Delhi   station police station for the past two years. He told the police that he was crossing a foot-over bridge when he saw the group of men sitting on the other side and passing lewd comments at passersby.
 
 He informed the cops that the men had liquor bottles with them and were creating a nuisance. When Singh confronted and asked them to move away, they started arguing with him and instead told Singh to leave them alone.
 
 As soon as Singh pulled out his lathi to charge the group away, one of the men came from behind and grabbed his wireless instrument and pushed him to the ground. Meanwhile, another person broke his liquor bottle on the wall and smashed Singh’s head with it before fleeing from the spot.
 
 Another cop, on hearing Singh’s call for help rushed to the spot and took him to a nearby nursing home. Singh was discharged after treatment on Tuesday evening.
 
 “We have registered a case against unknown men and CCTV footage from the area is being scrubbed to identify the accused,” said a senior police officer.
