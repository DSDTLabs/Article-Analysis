PANAJI: Probably the only   and a  , the   will be celebrated in a   dedicated solely to it. Scheduled to be held on February 26 near Siridao beach, the day-long festival will be a tribute to the centuries’ old instrument and will have experts debate on its conservation.

 Despite its popularity in Goa, little is known about the ghumot that has transcended geographical boundaries and found place among musical instruments in Karwar and Honnavar.
 
 Even though men are traditionally said to be primary players of the percussion instrument, women will take centre stage at the festival. The event will also be a melting pot of cultures as traditional Hindu players who play at the temple and Christian players who perform at community events will unveil their beats and style. Festival organizers are also trying to track Kunbi and Velip tribes in Goa who have their unique tunes to contribute.
 
 Potters will showcase a live demonstration of the making of the ghumot, while a string-maker, skin-cutter and skin-fitter will complete the product. A lesser-known alternate equivalent of the ghumot, the mandalem, will also be on display at the festival.
 
 A ghumot corner will have a music expert explaining the various features of the instrument to the visitors. A number of ghumots will also be available for sale. “The festival is an open invitation to ghumot owners and players to take part in the event,” said organizer Marius Fernandes.
