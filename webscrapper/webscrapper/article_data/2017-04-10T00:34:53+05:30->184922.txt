 Madurai: The   festival was celebrated with religious fervour and gaiety at Murugan temples across southern Tamil Nadu on Sunday. Lakhs of devotees converged on the Palani Dhandayudhapani temple to take part in the famous car festival.
 
 This festival is the most important one among the numerous festivals held at the Palani temple, and people redeem their vows by bringing water from the Cauvery river at Kodumudi in Erode district and performing abishekam for the deity. 
 
 Devotees from many parts of Tamil Nadu, including Coimbatore, Dindigul, Erode, Namakkal and Pollachi, undertook padayatras to reach the temple for this festival. The festival began on April 3 with the hoisting of the flag at the Avinankudi temple in the foothills. On Saturday, the celestial wedding was held and as many as 16 abhishekams were performed to the deity Muthukumarasamy and his consorts Valli and Deivanai. Several wedding rituals were also performed. The deities were then taken in a silver car around the streets of the temple. The culminating event of the festival, the car festival, was held on Sunday evening.
 
 People undertake fast for nearly ten days to attend the Panguni festival. Many of them carry ‘kavadis’ in various shapes as an offering to the deity. 
 
 The Tamil Nadu state transport corporation(TNSTC) operated special buses from many parts of the state to Palani in view of the festival. Over 2,000 police personnel were also pressed into duty during the festival.
 
 Meanwhile in the city, devotees took out processions to the Thiruparankundram temple situated about 12 kilometres away. Lakhs of people also gathered at the Tiruchendur Subramaniaswamy temple in Tuticorin district for the festival.
