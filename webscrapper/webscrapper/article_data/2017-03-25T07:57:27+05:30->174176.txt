 The ITE&C department said the international liaison office will give AP a headstart in terms of brand recognition and IESA will treat the state as a client known from start with access to local market. The partnership will also help facilitate tie-ups, technology transfer for Indian companies, who already have or will invest in AP within or outside the electronic manufacturing clusters.
