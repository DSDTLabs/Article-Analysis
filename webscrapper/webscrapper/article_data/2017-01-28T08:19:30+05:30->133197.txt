GHAZIABAD: Smartphones are ubiquitous and so are the inevitable selfies. However, some miscreants in the city have been taking advantage of young women striking poses in front of their phones, alone or with friends. When they are about to shoot the selfie, the snatchers strike.

 Two persons arrested on Thursday in Raj Nagar Extension have confessed to targeting women posing for selfies outside malls and marketplaces or any popular hangoout spot. They would wait for the moment when selfie pose was struck with hands held out, and would snatch the phone and rapidly speed away on their bike.
 
 The two accused have been identified as Balram and Armaan, who are both residents small towns of Uttar Pradesh and were active in the NCR for some time, police said. As many as three bikes, one scooter and two stolen mobile phones have been recovered from their possession. They would also attack bike or scooter riders. “They were active in this area for some time now and used to attack those riding their two-wheelers late at night. They would single them out, and wait for them to halt for any reason and then beat them up before making away with their bike or scooter,” said Heman Kumar Rai, SHO,  .
 
 The police had installed a checkpoint after receiving a tip-off from a source on their whereabouts and nabbed them both at Raj Nagar District Centre. “They were travelling on a stolen Pulsar bike and after spotting us tried to turn the bike around and flee but we caught them,” Rai said.
 
 During interrogation, the accused confessed to having stolen mobile phones at crowded places like malls, markets or other shopping complexes. They had snatched a mobile phone just a few days ago in the Old Bus Stand area of Ghaziabad.
 
 An FIR under Section 390 (Loot) of the IPC has been registered against the miscreants at the Kavi Nagar police station and the accused have been sent to judicial custody.
