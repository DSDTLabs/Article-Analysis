JAIPUR: The special operation group (SOG) of the   police arrested six persons on Monday for facilitating online cheating during the ongoing Rajasthan police constable recruitment exam. 

 The accused allegedly charged Rs 3 to 5 lakh from each candidate to facilitate cheating during the online exam and set up a 'control room' merely 500 metres away from a centre. The examination centre,  , has been barred from conducting the exam in the next phase.
 
 According to police, senior officers of the Rajasthan police, including inspector general (headquarters)  , had received an intelligence report that cheating was taking place at some centres where the online exam, which began last week, was being held. The constable recruitment exam was being held online in the state for the first time. 
 
 "We had a tip-off that at Saraswati Infotech, which is one of the online examination centres, online cheating was done by hacking into the local area network (LAN) using routers. A team of SOG officials visited the place and found that the fraudsters had set up a parallel computer centre at a restaurant nearly 500 meters away from the exam centre," said inspector general   M N, SOG. 
 
 The fraudsters facilitated online cheating by gaining remote access to computers at the examination centre. "The accused had taken a few rooms some 500 metres away from the exam centre. With some software they got direct access to computers at the exam centre as the test was being taken remotely via LAN and wireless connection," Dinesh added.
