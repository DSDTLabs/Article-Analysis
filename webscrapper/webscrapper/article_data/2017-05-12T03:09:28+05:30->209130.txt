GHAZIABAD: Unable to come to terms with the death of her father, a 22-year-old woman ended her life by jumping before an approaching train near   on Thursday, exactly the same way her father also ended his life, and at the same spot.

 The woman, Megha Verma, was a CA student and had recently been offered a job in a private company in Gurgaon. However, she was yet to accept the offer, her neighbours said.
 
 Megha was in depression ever since May 5 when her father Ashok Kumar Verma (52) ended his life. “She was extremely close to her father. Ever since her father killed himself, she had become extremely depressed and used to miss him all the time. She sometimes used to wake up screaming in the middle of the night,” said a police officer.
 
 On Thursday, around 1.15 pm, she jumped before an approaching train at the same spot her father committed suicide. The girl’s mutilated body was left unattended near the   for nearly an hour after which a passerby informed the police.
 
 The deceased's family did not approve post-mortem. They also demanded no further investigation in the matter. She is survived by an elder brother, a younger sister and her mother. 
 
 Apparently, the woman’s father, Ashok Kumar Verma suffered a major financial loss in his business that gave birth to constant family disputes between himself and his wife. A few days before his demise, during an argument with his wife, in a fit of rage, Ashok attacked his wife with a sharp object that left her hospitalised. However, on the afternoon of May 5, Ashok on his way back home on his scooter, parked it near the railway track close to the flyover and jumped before an approaching train. 
 
 “Her father’s death left Megha in a deep shock which ultimately claimed her life,” said Parshuram Kumar, SHO, Sihani Gate police station.
