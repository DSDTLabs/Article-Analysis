 complaining about the censor board is as regular as films tanking at the box office. But rarely does the censor board complain against makers. I was in for a surprise when the   sent out a notice to all its registered members, asking them to refrain from sending their films for   first and adding   later. As per the Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 1983, only the final version of a film can be sent for certification, but many have been flouting rules like it’s their Constitutional right. I hear several filmmakers from   too did the same — added subtitles much after certification. Those who saved their words from being beeped out will now have to save themselves from the censor board’s ire.
