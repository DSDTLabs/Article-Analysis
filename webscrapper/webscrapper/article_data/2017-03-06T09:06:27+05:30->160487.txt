LUCKNOW/VARANASI: On Saturday, when   (SP) supremo   rode a six-hour marathon journey through twisting, cramped bylanes from Kutchehry to Girijaghar and Vishwanath Temple with an endearing crowd, it wasn't without a bit of luck. After all, this is the second time the Yadav scion has got his favourite rath made at and moved from   to Lucknow.

 “I got this rath made from a place near Chandigarh. The best part about this man who makes my raths is that “woh jiska bhi rath banate hai, sarkaar usi ki banti hai (One who gets his rath made from him, forms the government),” Akhilesh tells TOI.
