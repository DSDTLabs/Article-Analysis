"Unlike some people, I have rarely had any issues when it has come to voting. Only once, several years ago, I had to go from one   station to another, in search of my name. On voting day, I ensure that I   in the afternoon — between 2 pm and 4 pm — because that is when I find that the crowd is the least. 

 "We must all make time to vote, because if we don’t vote, it’s one vote wasted, and that one vote could make all the difference to the party or person you want to see win. I also feel it’s unfair to complain or question politicians if you don’t take the initiative to go and vote. If you know where your name is registered, then you must make an effort to go there and cast your vote, even if it is not in the city of your residence. You must vote if you want to have a voice and point out what is wrong and what is not. Whether your complaint is heard or not is secondary; if you want to complain, you should be responsible enough to vote. 
 
 "Having said that, I don’t know if it makes sense to have   this time of year, since it is holiday season and for most people, this is the only time that they can take their children out on vacation. Unfortunately, people prioritise holidays over voting, so I think that is a big reason why the voting percentage in big cities is not that high."
