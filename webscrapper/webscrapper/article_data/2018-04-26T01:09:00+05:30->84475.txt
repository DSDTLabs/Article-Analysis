Salem: A 19-year-old student committed suicide by suffocating himself using a plastic bag in his house at Shankar Nagar here on Wednesday. Police are yet to ascertain the cause that drove him to take the extreme step.

 The deceased was identified as L Kevin Hary, of Shankar Nagar. According to the Hasthampatty police, he had appeared for the NEET exam in 2017, but couldn’t secure admission to a medical college. “His parents wanted him to appear for the NEET exam this year as well,” said a police officer.
 
 On Tuesday night, Kevin went to bed as usual. As he didn’t come out of his room on Wednesday morning, his mother peeped through the door gap and found his head covered with a thick plastic bag.
 
 His parents alerted the Hasthampatty police, who broke open the door and sent the body to the Salem government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital for postmortem.
 
 “We have not found any suicide note,” the police said. They suspect that the student might have taken the extreme step due to study pressure and depression.
 
 The police have registered a case and further investigation is on.
