Rajkot: An altercation over fishing in the village lake took an ugly turn in a village near Jasdan when a a 45-year-old man was murdered while his friend was grievously injured on Wednesday night

 The victim Gandu Katesiya tried to save his friend Mahesh Mehaniya (23) who was attacked by one Yunus and two others who objected to their fishing in the lake in Kundni village. 
 
 Yunus brutally stabbed Katesiya who died on the spot while Mahesh too received knife wounds in the abdomen. 
 
 The murder sparked massive outrage among the Koli community to which the victims belong. On Thursday, nearly 1,500 Kolis gathered in the village and refused to accept his body for cremation. 
 
 However, police got to know that Yunus also had suffered injuries and was under treatment at a private hospital in Morbi. He is under police watch and will be arrested once discharged.
 
 It was only after police convinced the community members of arresting the other two accused that people accepted Katesiya's body.
