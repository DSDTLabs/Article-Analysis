 "  is a senior person and I have respect for him. He has nothing to do with what happened in Koregaon Bhima. Those speaking against him do not have the credibility to do so," said Bhosale, a descendant of  .
 
 In a statement published from Delhi on the website of 'Maharashtra Times', Bhosale said, "I called him after it was alleged that he was responsible for the violence. He cried and asked me how he could have done this. He said he had gone to Vadhu Budruk village to clean a memorial."
 
 Bhosale said, "I don't believe in casteism. Politicians are using caste to politicise the issue for their own interest. Action should be taken against those creating tension in the society over caste. If this continues, our country will be torn into pieces. I will prefer to die than see this divide." 
 
 Bhosale said   was also his friend. "I am sure he too has not done anything that would have instigated the violence," he added.
