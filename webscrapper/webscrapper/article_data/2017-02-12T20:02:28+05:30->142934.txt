 Jolly LLB 2 is a comedy courtroom drama starring   and Huma Qureshi in lead roles. The movie is the sequel to hit franchise Jolly LLB which starred Arshad Warsi in lead role. It also stars Saurabh Shukla and Annu Kapoor in prominent roles. The movie is all set to hit the theatres on February 10.
 
 
 Akshay changes shades from crooked to straight, like a chameleon. In top-form, he puts up a perfect display of a street-smart lawyer who hasn’t read legal tomes but who has instead picked up tips from courtroom corridors to become Jolly LLB. Huma and Annu are also compelling enough. It is the fine display of histrionics by all these refined actors, which makes the movie, worth seeing. 
 
 
 
  According to boxofficeindia.com, Jolly LLB 2 collected 11-11.50 crore nett on day 1 as per early estimates. Watch this space for final figures. 
 
 
  According to bollywoodhungama.com, the film collected Rs. 21.21 lacs at Australia box office and Rs. 9.12 lacs at New Zealand box office.
