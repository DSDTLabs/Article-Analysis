NOIDA:   and his   were possibly planning to start a new venture when their cover was blown on February 2. Investigators said the accused had transferred Rs 4.5 crore to a company and placed order for laptops and tablets for a new venture – intmaart.com — which they suspect was to be run as an e-commerce firm, using the Social Trade database.

 UP Police’s special task force (STF) also discovered a PowerPoint presentation that throws more light on the nature of the fraud Mittal and others managed to engineer. The PPT slides, investigators said, mentioned Delhi and UP government agencies as clients of Ablaze Info Solutions, which appears to be Mittal’s main company, besides a leading private bank, a private college and a beverages major to convince investors about the profile of the company. Mittal, they said, claimed to have contracts from them to raise their profile on social media by increasing the number of likes. 
 
 Raj Kumar Mishra, DSP of the STF, said the college administration had informed the STF they had no connection with Ablaze and had not given them any contract. “We are trying to verify with other organisations named in the PPT slides,” he said.
 
 Mittal has, meanwhile, told investigators the company had received Rs 3,700 crore from investors and disbursed Rs 3,000 crore. The disbursement included salary of staff, rent of the company premises, return of investors, transactions made to third parties for business purposes, etc. Investigators have found records of 9.10 lakh IDs that were purportedly created for Social Trade. Some bank officials, who allegedly helped Mittal launder money, are also being investigated. “We suspect huge transactions have been made in the name of some fictitious company,” said Amit Pathak, SSP of STF. The STF has found Rs 512 crore in 12 bank accounts, which has now been frozen.
