Mysuru: Rangayana’s annual   fest –   – which brings together artistes from across the country was inaugurated on Sunday by playwright and actor  . The eight-day festival will feature as many as 84 groups, 24 plays and other performances.

 Reminiscing his association with   who was instrumental in establishing  , Karnad said, “I’m inaugurating Bahuroopi for the second time and I’m glad to be here to see the dream BV Karanth and I saw together a good 30 years ago. Karanth and I used to have lengthy debates about how to save the theatre scene in Karnataka and today I’m happy to see how far the institution has come...
 
 “Karanth and I have shared many things other than ideas...whiskey and rum too,” he quipped, to laughter from the audience.
 
 “We used to have debates and fight with each other while discussing ways in which we would revive theatre in Karnataka all through the night and wake up the next morning remembering nothing,” Karnad recalled. 
 
 The theme of the fest for this year is migration. “It is an apt theme for the fest as we are witnessing the problems faced by migrants in the Middle East and South America. It is a great experiment,” he said.
 
 Karnad, who was using an oxygen box due to lung problem, said, “When I was offered the Bollywood movie ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’, I told the makers that I won’t be able to act without my oxygen box and they asked me to act with it. Today, wherever I go, people still think I’m in character and ask me if I never take off my make-up.”
 
 Striking a serious note, Rangayana director Bhagirathi Bai Kadam said these are times of chaos. “There is mayhem in the entire country. There is a lot of disturbance in Assam where I have lived for a major part of life... Organizations such as United Liberation Front of Assam (Ulfa) and the presence of the Indian Army has the people in a fix and worried.”
