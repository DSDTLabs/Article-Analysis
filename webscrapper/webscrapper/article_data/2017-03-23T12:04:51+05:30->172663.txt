NAGPUR: With a view to help inmates find employment after their release, the Indira Gandhi National Open University ( ) has inked a pact with Hero MotoCorp to start a short term skill-based course at Nagpur Central Jail. This would be the first such programme by the university in the state.

 A small unit would be set up inside the   with a two-ramp workshop. Tools, dummy engine, and a 100cc motorcycle would be provided for learning. The course is likely to start from April.
 
 Ignou regional director P Sivaswaroop said, “Ignou is trying to spread vocational educational especially to marginalized people. Earlier, we did it in   where a lot of poor women benefited from such courses. For prisoners, we already have BA, BCom and MA programmes. But, some are not interested in them. So, for them, we are starting this new course. In Maharashtra, Nagpur Central Jail would be the first to have this programme.”
 
 Manoj Raut, area service learning manager, Hero MotoCorp, Nagpur, said, “Prisoners would undergo a two-wheeler repairing course for two-months. We plan to hold at least five batches per year. This course is being run in collaboration with Ignou at others prisons like Tihar and Baroda in the country. There the course is very popular among other vocational trainings being imparted to inmates.”
 
 “The programme is intended to rehabilitated prisoners after their release. After undergoing the training, an inmate can become an entrepeur, start his small repairing shop or work with someone. The certificate awarded at the end wouldn’t have any mention that the training was imparted during the awardee’s stay in jail. Beside, it would help them avail bank finance too,” he added.
 
 “Initially, I will train an inmate who has some skill related to motorcycle engines. We have identified an inmate who is BE (Mechanical). In the first batch, this person will be assigned the job of training others. I would function as a visiting faculty,” he said.
