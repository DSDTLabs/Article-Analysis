CHANDIGARH:Arun Sharma lives on the second floor of   (CHB) flats in Sector 38-West. He carries buckets of water from the ground floor to the top floor multiple times these days. There is no water in the kitchen or bathroom. He complains of getting no prompt response from   ( ) when contacted for tanker service to fill the dried tanks.

 The water crisis in Sector 38-West has reached to a crescendo over the past six weeks. In CHB flats, the residents are dependent on the water pressure for filling up their tanks. However, due to the absence of booster system, the tanks installed on the fourth floor have dried up. This has forced the residents staying on the upper floors to store water in buckets for their daily use.
 
 Residents also complained about their fellow residents misusing water for washing their vehicles early in the morning. As per their claims, no action has been taken by the MC authorities so far against the defaulters.
 
 Mayor Davesh Moudgil assured the water supply problems will be solved by May 6. He visited the Kajauli and Jandpur pumping stations on Thursday to oversee the situation along with the officials from Greater Mohali Area Development Authority and irrigation department.
 
 Regarding the lack of action against the defaulters, the mayor said, “In the initial days of implementing the challan system, we handed over notices for the first few days so as to avoid creating panic among the public. We will definitely take action against the offenders.”
