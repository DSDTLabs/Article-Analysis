MUMBAI:   on Monday said it could not bring work on   to a stop. A division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Riyas Chagla was hearing an application filed by NGO   to restrain   Simplex Infrastructure from carrying out construction work for 11   stations.

 The bench said the contractor had not been blacklisted and there was difference between the two works. It scheduled the   as well as application for hearing on April 24.
