The postmortem report had mentioned only about injuries on the face.
 
 "Already Jishnu's mother had submitted a letter to the state health minister urging to look into the lapses in the postmortem. We feel that the decision to entrust the postmortem to a PG medical student despite the availability of a forensic surgeon is suspicious. Already the health department has commenced its inquiry, " Sreejith said.
