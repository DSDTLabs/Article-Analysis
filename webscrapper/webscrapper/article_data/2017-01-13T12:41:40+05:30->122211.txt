AHMEDABAD: Ever wondered why a particular advertisement sticks in your memory for years or a specific tune is always associated with a product? 

 What if the advertisers know what’s going on in brain while processing a specific advertisement?
 
 It’s precisely what a team from   (PDPU) will try to answer when they will use  , generally associated with psychological test to solve crimes, for study of consumer psychology.
 
 Prof T  , director general of PDPU, signed an MoU with Krishna Ika, president & CEO of the US-based Brainwave Science, LLC on Thursday as part of VGGIS for a research collaboration in the area for five-year project. Brainwave Science will customize the patented technology for market research and advertisement effectiveness. The instruments will cost Rs1.86 crore, said officials. “It would be for the first time that the technology, used for forensic psychology, would be used for developing consumer psychology technique. We are excited about the prospects and have extended our support,” said Ika.
 
 Ritu Sharma, head, department of psychology at PDPU’s   (SLS) where the study will be conducted, said that the precision system would be used to conduct research validation study combining data from EEG, biometrics, eye tracking and self-reporting. 
 
 “The results can be used for optimization of advertisement, feature of the product, brand association and storyline development. The research will rely on concepts of neuro-marketing to understand how brain processes images, sounds and commercials,” she said.
