LUCKNOW: It was like any other Sunday for Oshin, when all her extended relatives and close friends were about to gather over lunch and the servants were busy cooking. Everything was usual, except the kababs were made of bottle guard, biryani was without chicken and keema curry was prepared with soya chunks.

 Weekend coincided with eve of   and   vendors’ strike disappointed lakhs of non-vegetarians in the city. 
 
 “We planned a barbecue for friends and family before Navaratra because for the next nine days we will strictly be on a fruit and vegetable diet, eating not even eggs but this unexpected ban has washed away all plans,” rued  , a resident of Alambagh.
 
 Almost all non-vegetarians in the city are facing similar problem. “I have stuffed my freezer with meat. On the very first day of the strike, I had bought two dozen packs of processed meat from the departmental store nearby,” said Arjit Sinha, a businessman. College-goer   said, “I have requested one of my friends in the Army to bring me packed frozen meat from their canteen and I hope there is ample stock. It is so difficult to survive only on vegetables.”
 
 Most restaurants have stopped serving non-veg following scarcity of meat, while outlets of multi-national fast-food chains have seen a huge rush since the meat crisis in state.
 
 “We take orders till 11pm but surprisingly on Saturday some of the items finished much before that as demand increased up to 20% in past couple of days,” said Manish Chauhan, manager at a fast food restaurant in Saharaganj.
