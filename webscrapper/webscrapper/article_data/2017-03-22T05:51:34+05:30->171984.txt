CHANDIGARH: The parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare has blamed delays in major projects at PGI to “bureaucratic procedures”. The committee presented its report to   on Monday, where it has expressed its “displeasure at the tardy progress of implementation” of some of the major projects.

 The projects include Advance Cardiac Centre, ACC (Phase II), modernisation of Research ‘A’ and ‘B’ Block and modernisation of  , which were to be completed during the 11th Five Year Plan. The report, however, mentioned that these projects were “nowhere close to execution even after the lapse of four years of the 12th Plan period.”
 
 The committee, while disapproving this slow progress, recommended that the Union ministry should closely monitor the activities being undertaken and fast-track these projects to ensure that no cost or time overruns are reported.
 
 “We will try our best to remove any obstacle in the completion of these projects and allow them to be over in a time-bound manner,” said Dr  , director, PGI.
 
 In phase two of the ACC, there was plan of expansion of the cardiac centre, including paediatric intensive care unit, addition of seminar rooms and more beds. The modernization of Nehru Hospital and research blocks included upgradation of old buildings and also enable them to be fire-safe. For modernization of Nehru Hospital and research blocks A and B, CPWD gave estimates amounting to Rs 239.34 crore and Rs 76.36 crore, respectively.
 
 As on end of January this year, the actual expenditure for the PGI was Rs 68 crore under plan head and Rs 773.00 crore was under non-plan. The committee blamed bureaucratic delay in approvals despite availability of financial and physical resources. “There have been delays from the CPWD and the   (NBCC). Finances have never been a problem. The cost of the project which was to start five years ago, will also escalate due to these slow approvals,” said a faculty member.
