Pune: KhetiGadi, a Pune-based farm equipment-listing enterprise, aims to go national by adapting its app and web application to local languages. The company is also looking for angel investors and venture capital investments to grow into a Rs 10-crore enterprise by 2020. “The mission is to introduce digitisation into tractor buying, selling and renting and then take it to as many farmers as possible,” said Pravin Shinde, the CEO of Kheti Gadi. The company is a kind of listing enterprise — dedicated solely to farm equipment — on the lines of justdial and sulekha for businesses. For now, the company is bringing out its Android-based app in 18 languages and its website in 10 regional languages. The idea, according to Shinde, is to reach nearly a crore farmers. KhetiGadi is banking on the need for farm mechanisation in the bulk of India’s small and marginal farmlands, which account for about 80% of the country’s total cultivable area. It also provides assistance on loans and has managed to enrol 25 lakh farmers across Maharashtra on its platform.
