PATIALA: Daughter of a small farmer who also works as a property dealer, Husandeep Kaur, who has stood first in the non-medical stream of Class XII exams, is also shooting champion. Her success mantra - nine-hour study at night besides tuitions during the day. 

 Husandeep of Alooarkh village in Sangrur district gives credit of her success to her teachers and parents. Besides, she is a state-level player in rifle shooting and has won a silver medal in the state-level school games held at Badal, Muktsar, in October 2016. She started participating in shooting events while in Class XI.
 
 Her mother Harjinder Kaur is a housewife while her little brother is student of class VII, for whom Husandeep has remained always an inspiration. "Dedication and hard work are keys to success but one needs support of parents, guide and teachers, who motivate and boost your morale. I started shooting in Class XII when I joined another school at  , around 6 km away from my village. Besides studying at school, I use to go tuition for a few subjects and then used to study for nine hours at night. My mother used to remain awake and sometimes even served me tea,"remembers Husandeep.
 
 Sukhchain Singh said that, "She has made us proud. Earlier, too she had scored good marks in Class X. This time her untiring efforts has brought laurels to her."

It rarely happens that a student is a champion in both sports and studies. Two more students of our school,   Kaur and  , have bagged 11th and 23rd rank in the state while Jashanpreet stood third in Sangrur district," added Toor.
