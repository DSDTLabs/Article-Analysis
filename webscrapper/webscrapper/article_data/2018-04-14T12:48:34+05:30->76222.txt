CUTTACK: The   and Hospital premises will be disinfected as soon as new technology is installed for sterilization of biomedical-waste. Land has already been demarcated for the bio-microwave plant, which will be installed this month. 

 Until now, biomedical waste was being dumped and burned directly, bringing the harmful gases it emits directly in contact with the environment. The new plant will sterilise all the collected waste before it is dumped.
 
 "SCB generates 315kg of bio-waste a day, including laboratory waste, blood samples, micro-biological waste, blood bags, used syringes. These can spread infection if dumped without sterilisation. Now, they will be put into the microwave plant for disinfection with radiation, heat and chemical processing," said an official of the hospital.
 
 This new bio-waste management system will prevent misuses and pilferage of waste product.
 
 Rs sicx lakh has been allocated for the microwave disinfection system machine, that can sterilise 100 kg of bio-waste per day.
 
 "The advanced technology will help ensure the safety of the hospital's environment," said   superintendent Shyama Kanungo.
