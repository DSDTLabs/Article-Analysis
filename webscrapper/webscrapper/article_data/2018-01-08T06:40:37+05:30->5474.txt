HOWRAH: A traffic policeman allegedly assaulted a 59-year-old bus passenger after he raised his voice when the cops were allegedly harassing a Matador driver early on Sunday morning. The incident took place at the Kona Expressway-NH-2 crossing. 

 According to another passenger, Ajay Ray, a   assistant sub-inspector got onto the bus and slapped and abused Dankuni-resident Shyam Kumar Sau for protesting against the alleged police harassment.
 
 The incident took place at 7.45am, around 15 minutes before the road restrictions for goods vehicles came into force. But the   traffic cops had already put up guard rails and were allegedly stopping goods vehicles. A Matador driver, who asked them why they were stopping goods vehicles since it was not yet 8am, was reportedly dragged out and assaulted by the cops. Sau, who works in Uluberia food park on night shift, saw this and shouted out in protest.
 
 Serampore resident Ajay Ray, who was on the same bus along with his wife and two kids, said, "As soon as Sau protested, the policeman got furious. He got onto the bus, walked straight to Sau, pulled off his cap and slapped and abused him. It was only after all the passengers started protesting that the cop left the bus. But not before a constable clicked Sau's photograph on his cellphone and forbade him to take the same route ever again." A scared Sau didn't lodge any police complaint. He refused to speak to the media either. Ray said Sau told them he didn't want to antagonise the police, since he had to work and had a family to feed.
 
 The OC, Bally Traffic Guard, Kalyan Chakraborty, said: "I cannot act on heresay. No formal complaint has been lodged. The police were well within their rights to put up guard rails and stop goods vehicles."
 
 The DCP (North),  , J A Kidwai, also denied any knowledge of any police wrongdoing. There was no CCTV that covers the spot where the incident took place.
