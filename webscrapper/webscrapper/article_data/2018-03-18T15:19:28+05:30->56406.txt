Both of them are working together after 10 years and Koel Mallick feels her co-actor’s (Jisshu U Sengupta) only form of recreation is to pull her legs on the sets of Ghare and Baire! “Jisshu will do all the mischief with a straight face. He will make you feel you are the one at fault! But jokes apart, we share a great camaraderie off screen which helped us portray Labonyo and Amit better on screen,” said Koel, the lead actress of Mainak Bhaumik’s Ghare And Baire. She further added, “My character Labonyo is just the opposite of what I am like in real life. She is extrovert, dominating and lives life on her terms. Amit is her childhood friend and they bond over music. The film celebrates Bangalina, Bangla music and most importantly, friendship.”
