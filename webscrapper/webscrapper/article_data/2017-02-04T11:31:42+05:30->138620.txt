THANE: Shona, a three-year-old female stray, who had been bedridden for almost four months is back on her feet with the help of a  . The dog, who was born in Ovala in Thane, was paralyzed after she met with an accident in September 2016. After the accident, a local, Janvi  , had rushed Shona to a hospital and she has been taking care of the stray since then.

 “I have known Shona since she was born. I used to feed her everyday. On September 17, when Shona was sleeping under a parked car, the vehicle’s owner drove over her. After running over Shona, the man fled the spot. I had registered a police complaint against him,” said Bhagwat.
 
 While the stray was given first aid at a hospital, she had to be taken to a vet for further treatment. Bhagwat visited three to four vets, and all suggested that the dog be euthanized as her condition was critical. But Bhagwat did not lose hope and eventually came across Dr  , who helped Shona stand on her forefoot.
 
 “The dog had suffered fracture near her lungs and was paralyzed as her main nerve was damaged. Initially she was given physiotherapy and treatment was started on her forelegs. During the first couple of days, Shona was made to stand on her forelegs for a minute and the time increased as weeks passed. She was also made to climb a few stairs gradually. Post these exercises, she started regaining her reflexes and her nerves started responding. Now she can walk on her forelegs with the help of a wheel cart. Treatment on her hind legs will start soon,” said Dr Gupte. 
 
 “Earlier, we had created a sling to take her for walks but then we bought a cart and that made it easier for her to move around. The day when Shona will run around on all her legs is not far away,” said Bhagwat.
