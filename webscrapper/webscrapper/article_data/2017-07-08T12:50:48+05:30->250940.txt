PATNA: The state   on Friday maintained that the   raids on 12 premises of RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his family members smacked of “political vendetta” on the part of the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.

 “From what we have gathered so far, the CBI raids on the premises of Lalu and his family members appear to be a case of political vendetta by BJP,” state CPI secretary   said after the party’s two-day state council meet concluded on Friday.
 
 CPI’s national secretary and former MP Nagendra Nath Ojha and senior state functionary Jabbar   accompanied Singh at Janshakti Bhawan. “Lalu was actively involved in the process for opposition unity. Besides, he has also been among the most vocal critics of the BJP, RSS and PM Narendra Modi,” Singh added.
 
 The party perceived the CBI raids on the premises of Lalu, his wife   (former CM) and their minister son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, along with five others, as a fresh setback to the ‘anti-BJP’, ‘anti-PM Modi’ and ‘anti-RSS’ political forces. 
 
 The first recent setback, as Alam put it, was the “unilateral decision of CM Nitish” to support BJP’s presidential candidate and former Bihar governor Ram Nath Kovind. “It queered the pitch for opposition unity in the country. Ironically, at one time,   himself had initiated the process for opposition unity early this year,” Alam said.
