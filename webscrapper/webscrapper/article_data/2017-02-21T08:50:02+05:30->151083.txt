AMRITSAR: Sikhs in the UK are hopeful of securing a   for the   in the next   even as the community is already recognized as a   in the optional religious question introduced in the Census 2001. 

 Gurjeet Singh, national press secretary of Sikh Federation (UK), told TOI on Monday that Sikh organizations and gurdwaras came together at the time of the Census 2011 to demonstrate the strength of feeling in the Sikh community by urging the Sikhs to reject existing categories like Indian and use the write-in option by ticking other and writing Sikh. 
 
 He said that Office for National Statistics (ONS) had confirmed nearly 84,000 Sikhs in the Census 2011 had 'protested' by doing that. This number is several times higher than any other group using the write-in option, like Kashmiris were around 25,000.
 
 He claimed that Sikh Federation, Sikh Network and the All Party Parliamentary Group for UK Sikhs had been working closely with the ONS for the last two years and leading the campaign. "ONS has carried out several consultations in last two years and in 2017 are carrying out a number of tests and research before reaching a final decision later this year and presenting proposals to Parliament in the Census White Paper in 2018, before approval in 2019," Gurjeet added. 
 
 Chair of the Sikh body, Amrik Singh said, "We have started our awareness campaign to ensure as many Sikh households as possible, probably around 2,000 each in Hounslow and Wolverhampton take part in the survey. We are in the process of liaising with MPs, local councillors and gurdwaras to provide any assistance necessary with those who require help in completing the online survey as we would during the Census itself."
 
 He further said that they had been in contact with both MPs for Hounslow - Ruth Cadbury and Seema Malhotra - and three MPs for Wolverhampton - Rob Marris, Pat McFadden and Emma Reynolds - who were supportive of the demand for a Sikh ethnic tick box.
