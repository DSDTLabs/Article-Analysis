MOHALI: Despite monsoon arriving after a long wait,   failed to make preparations like repair of sewerage or drainage system, setting the stage for monsoon woes like waterlogging.

 In 2015-16, the MC spent Rs 15 lakh for a survey on waterlogging by Punjab Engineering College ( ). The survey report was passed in the house after a four-month delay. One year has passed since then but suggestions of the report are yet to be implemented.
 
 Residents of phases 1, 2, 4, 6, Mohali village and Madanpura have been demanding preparations before the rainy season but nothing has been done. Even the PEC survey report has been ignored. 
 
 An MC official said, “The drainage system is cleaned in waterlogged areas. We do not know why the house has turned a blind eye towards the problem even after the PEC survey.”
 
 The survey report was handed over in March, 2016 but officials delayed action. Area residents said, “It did not rain till today, then why didn’t officials start repair work? Repair was started in phase 8, 9, sector 71 and 70 but just a day before rain.”
 
 Incidentally, no repair work has been conducted in low-lying areas, which are the worst affected.   councillor Kuljit Singh Bedi said, “When monsoon arrives, the MC starts digging pipes. This means the civic body has no plans and wastes money in unplanned repairs.”
 
 According to the PEC survey, sewer and rainstorm water pipelines are four decades old. New pipes to be laid would need a diametre of 80 to 100mm to discharge rainwater. Installation of a rainwater harvesting system is also needed.
