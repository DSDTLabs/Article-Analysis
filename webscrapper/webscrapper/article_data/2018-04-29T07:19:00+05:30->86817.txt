Ludhiana: A mini-truck ferrying 20 pilgrims, including five children and nine women, overturned near Sherpur on Saturday morning, when the driver crashed into a divider in an attempt to save a stray dog. Following this, all passengers fell down on the road and sustained injuries. They were rushed to hospital, where 17 of them were discharged after first aid.

 The victims admitted to hospital are Ramwati (65), Saraswat (65), and Gopi Ram (37) â€” all of them from Bharatpur in Rajasthan. They were heading back to their homes after paying their obeisance at Shri Vaishno Devi shrine in Jammu.
