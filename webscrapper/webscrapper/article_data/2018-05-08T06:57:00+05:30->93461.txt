Kolkata: As many as 72 members of Aligarh Muslim University Old Boys’ Association, Kolkata, met on Saturday evening to discuss the row over the portrait of M A  . 

 On Monday, members of AMUOBA Kolkata sent a memorandum to the President, governors and CMs of UP and Bengal, among others. 
 
 AMUOBA Kolkata president Mohammed Ataullah Khan condemned the “partisan and biased attitude of the local administration” for not arresting the “goons” and not “registering an FIR against them”. The association condemned the “lathicharge” on the peaceful protest by students. AMUOBA (Kolkata) secretary Waquar A Khan will be in Aligarh to meet the district administration and protesting students.
 
 Khan said: “Jinnah can be a piece of history but nowhere a part of our ideology. We never had or will support him. All central universities, including AMU, come under UGC. The President of India is the final authority on whether or not the portrait should hang there.”
 
 Meanwhile, Taslima Nasreen sparked a row by tweetiting: “Not only Jinnah hall was renamed Surya Sen hall,in Bangladesh Jinnah Avenue was renamed Bangabandhu Avenue,Jinnah college was renamed Titumir college. Jinnah was not respected,cause he declared Urdu,only Urdu should be the state language of East Pakistan,where majority r Bengalis (sic).”
