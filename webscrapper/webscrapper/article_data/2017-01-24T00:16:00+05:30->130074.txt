Bhopal: City boxer Purnima Rajput has her task cut out as she goes pro — her first bout is against not one Russian boxer, but two. She is up against the wife-husband team of Panian and Mikhail Murinchi.

 Purnima, a national gold medallist, is no pushover and her fight with this one-two combination will be one to watch out for on January 24 as Bhopal hosts the country’s first warm-up match for a pro-boxing league expected to be announced this year. 
 
 Three Russian boxers — Panian , Misiura Oleg and — arrived in Bhopal on Sunday and lost no time in getting into the ring at Tatya Tope Stadium. After hammering the punching bag and a life-size dummy, Panian said: “I have come here to win. I do not want to lose a bout in front of my husband. He is also my coach so it is all the more important for me to prove his training correct.” 
 
 During training, Mikhail was seen trying to make her wife feel she will not lose. “She is an excellent boxer. She won the European championship under my training four years ago,” said Mikhail. “I can’t see my wife losing this bout.” They have been married for five years. 
 
 About the training session, Mikhail said, “It has been always easy for me to coach her. We have very strong bonding. She is like any other boxer during my training session. The best part is that we can discuss boxing at home also. I think this gives us an edge over others.” 
 
 Purnima is among five national champions going toe-to-toe with Russian pros — including European champion Abdur Rehmano Radmir. Apart from Purnima, there are two other boxers from Madhya Pradesh — Rahul Pasi and Monty Uikey. It’s Uikey who will take on Radmir. The event is being held with the support of the state sports and youth welfare department.
