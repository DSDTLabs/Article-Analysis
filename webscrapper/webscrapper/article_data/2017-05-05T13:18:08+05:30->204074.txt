NAGPUR: The   (NIIT), Nagpur, is looking to provide skill development training to students of IT as well as existing professionals in the sector, said chief executive officer   on Thursday.

 Patwardhan was speaking at a press conference at   on ‘An urgent call to action: India’s youth face a clear and present danger’ which discussed the threat to IT sector and how engineering colleges are complementing to the problem and the suggestion of NIIT towards solving it.
 
 “The IT sector is facing threat where the profit margins are coming down and hiring freshers has become a problem,” he said.
 
 “The work in IT firms is based on   skills which is a challenge before the workers in performing well since the curriculum in colleges lacks learning science and technology,” he said.
 
 Patwardhan suggested accelerated learning system which provides job ready outcome and a scalable model to meet the demand of digitally skilled employees in the industry. 
 
 NIIT has come up with a number of programmes one of which is StackRoute Immersive (SRI).
 
 “SRI was a three-month work experience training programme with an intake of 72 students per batch but was unable to cater to the huge need of re-skilling the existing workforce and undergraduates. 
 
 The institute will also launch   (NIIT Inside College), a newer version of their existing DigiNX/. which will be conducted inside NIIT to help students in developing themselves in digital skills, he said.
