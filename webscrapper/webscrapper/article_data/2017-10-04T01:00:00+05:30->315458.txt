MOTIHARI: Continuing their protest for the fifth day, scores of students of Mahatma Gandhi Central University ( ) along with ABVP members staged a dharna on Tuesday at the varsity gate to protest against the alleged autocratic attitude of the vice chancellor (VC), Arvind Agarwal, and dismissal of three teachers.

 Apart from students, at least 36 out of 66 MGCU teachers also went on an indefinite strike and joined the students sitting on dharna on Tuesday demanding immediate withdrawal of termination order of all their colleagues, who were axed on September 28, without citing any reason. The three teachers axed by the university are Prof Shashi Kant Ray of biochemistry, Prof Amit Ranjan of zoology and Prof Sandeep of management studies. 
 
 Supporting the cause of MGCU students and teachers, ABVP members led by Niraj Kumar also submitted a memorandum to the VC requesting him to change his decision of termination of teachers. Meanwhile, a letter signed by RLSP MP Arun Kumar, former union minister Akhilesh Singh and others were sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his immediate intervention into the matter.
 
 The VC, however, said all allegations are baseless and the teachers were removed by a committee. “The teachers have been sacked by the executive council and I have not done any wrong,” he said.
