AHMEDABAD: City crime branch sleuths in a joint operation with UP police arrested   — prime accused in the daring Rs 98 lakh theft from a cash van recently — from   in UP. Crime branch officials said while Baghela was brought to the city late on Saturday night, they are hunting for other accused involved in the sensational theft.

 Senior crime branch officials said while they have not been able to recover any cash from Baghela, they seized a motorcycle used in the theft.
 
 
 “We had a tough time in Mainpuri as Baghela is a local and had a lots of support. UP police helped cordon off the area before we nabbed Baghela,” a senior crime branch official said.
 
 Baghela had joined the   about six months before the incident, with the sole purpose of pulling off the heist. “He had drugged his three colleagues, Dhaval Panwala, Siddhant Chavda and the gunman Jiteshsingh Tomar, by offering them tea near an ATM kiosk near Rajpath Club.
 
 The trio soon felt sick and fell unconscious in the van. Baghela then made off with Rs 98 lakh cash with associates who were waiting for him at the spot on a motorcycle.
 
 “All the addresses he had furnished when joining the cash management company,  , which is mainly involved in loading cash in ATMs, turned out be false. The involvement of other accused, including an ex-army man, has come light. Teams have been formed to nab them too,” an investigator added.
 
 On interrogating Baghela, it emerged that he had planned the heist right from the time he joined the company and had conspired with his associates.
 
 “It was a well-planned heist. The accused had immediately left the city and went straight to Mainpuri. We have also deployed a team at Etawah, which is Baghela’s native place,” added a senior crime branch official.
