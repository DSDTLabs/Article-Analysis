ALWAR: The   probing the   racket case said that the counterfeit note racket extends from   to Delhi and even to Bihar.

 “We have found that fakes notes are being printed in Delhi, parts of Bihar and circulated across the Mewat region of Rajasthan,” a senior police official said.
 
 Cops added that the gang members received a commission for circulating these fake notes.
 
 “On Saturday, we had arrested three people with fake currencies of the new Rs 500 note. Following interrogations, it was revealed that the main culprits were residing in Delhi and Bihar. They had hired several agents to circulate the fake currency notes,” police said.
 
 On Sunday, the cops had sent a team to Delhi to carry out search operations. They will also send cops to Bihar to raid certain places.
 
 “Earlier, we thought that it was a small Mewat-based gang. But the fine printing of notes suggests that the network is widespread,” police said.
 
 Three people were arrested by the Pahadi police when they were trying to circulate fake notes of Rs 500 in the local market. The accused revealed they had received the notes from a person in Delhi,” said a senior district police official.
 
 Those arrested on Saturday were Mohammad Naushad, Noor Mohammad and Iqbal.
 
 “They had come to city with samples of Rs 500 notes to test if they can be circulated without people noticing minor anomalies in serial numbers,” cops said.
 
 The gang's plan was discovered after a shopkeeper identified the fake note and informed the police. “We raided their vehicle and found Rs 5,300 in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 50. All these notes had the same serial number,” cops said.
