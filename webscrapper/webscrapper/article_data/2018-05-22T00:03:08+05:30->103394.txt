Pimpri Chinchwad: The Pimpri Chinchwad police commissionerate will be set up on a temporary basis at the municipal-run Mahatma Jyotiba Phule English Medium School at Premlok Park in Chinchwad by August 15, district guardian minister Girish Bapat said.

 The commissionerate will be located at a central place connecting Akurdi, Nigdi, Pradhikaran, Pimpri, Pimple Saudagar, Dapodi and Bhosari. The additional police commissionerate will function from Spine Road in Chikhli. A report on the same will be sent to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis within 10 days.
 
 A meeting was conducted in this regard where MLAs Laxman Jagtap, Mahesh Landge, Gautam Chabukswar, additional police commissioner Pradip Deshpande, district rural police superintendent Suvez Hak and PCMC additional commissioner Pravin Ashtikar were present. A police station would be set up in Chikhli, Bapat said.
 
 A month ago, police officials had identified different. Deputy commissioner of police Ganesh Shinde had sent a letter to municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar, stating that the school at Premlok Park was suitable for setting up the commissionerate.
 
 Social and citizens groups have opposed shifting of the police commissionerate to the school at Premlok Park. The Nagari Hakk Suraksha Samiti said they would stage an agitation if the commissionerate was shifted to Premlok Park.
 
 Manav Kamble, the samiti convener, has sent a letter to the PCMC commissioner. Around 650 students are studying in the school for the past five years.
 
 The commissionerate will cover approximately 625sqkm. A total of 15 police stations will be under its jurisdiction. The Pune-Mumbai Expressway, Pune-Mumbai highway, Pune-Nashik highway and Katraj-Dehu Road bypass will also come under it.
