PANAJI: March 2017 was   than March last year, as the meteorological centre at   recorded a mean maximum temperature of 33.5celsius.

 “It was slightly hotter than last year, but it is within the normal range,” D Sanap, scientist at the centre said on Sunday. In March 2016, the met centre had recorded a mean maximum temperature of 33.4celsius. A mean maximum of 32.1celsius is considered normal, but if the increase is less than 1.5, it is considered within the normal range. 
 
 Nights too were pleasant enough over the last month, as a mean minimum of 22.9celsius was recorded by the centre during March this year- exactly within the normal range. The average minimum and maximum temperatures were mostly normal, though the mercury and apprehensions rose sharply on March 2, this year. Temperatures had soared to 36.9celsius. That was the highest recorded during the month which later subsided to normal. “It was hot only for a few days,” Sanap said.
 
 Few may remember the soaring heat during the first week of March 2013; the month ended up being the hottest in 40 years. The met centre had recorded a mean maximum of 34.5celsius, 2.4 above normal. For seven consecutive days, the maximum temperature was stuck at 37+ celsius , after 37.2celsius was recorded on March 1, 2013.
 
 While last month was pleasant, the mercury dropped during the morning hours sharply to 19.1C on March 11, fell further to 18.5C on March 12 before rising to 19.3C on March 13.
