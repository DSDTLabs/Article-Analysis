CHANDIGARH: The   high command has put on hold list of delegates or members at the block-level of its   unit. It has also decided to have a re-look at the members from Haryana nominated into the All India Congress Committee (AICC). The lists were put on hold ahead of beginning of plenary session of AICC at New Delhi. Now, the party top brass will prepare the new list of delegates at both levels in Haryana.

 While finalizing the list of Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) delegates last month, its president Ashok Tanwar had accommodated his followers while ignoring those owing allegiance to former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Congress   ( ) leader Kiran Choudhry, former Union minister Kumari Selja and Kuldeep  , supporters of other leaders have alleged.
 
 Consequently, Hooda, Choudhary, Selja and Bishnoi managed to get their supporters adjusted in the list of AICC delegates released last week. Sources said that the entire exercise was allegedly carried out by senior leaders of Haryana Congress to dominate each other during the ongoing session in New Delhi.
 
 It led to a controversy ahead of the session and as a result, the Congress high command had put names of the members in both lists on hold. Some members, who included former MLAs and MPs, ex-ministers and office-bearers, got the tickets to attend the plenary while many were left out.
 
 HPCC finance secretary   confirmed the development. “We are here to follow the instructions given by the party high command. Hence both lists have been put on the hold as these are under scrutiny,” he said.
