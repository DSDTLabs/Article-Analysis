RANCHI: At least 45 girl students of   (KGBV) Lawalong were injured on Saturday when the bus they were travelling on turned turtle in Chatra district. 

 The students were on their way to a matriculation examination centre of   in Simaria block when the accident occurred. 
 
 Tandwa SDPO Ashutosh Shekhar said, “The driver of the bus took a sharp turn to avoid collision with an auto-rickshaw that was coming from the opposite side and turned turtle.”
 
 However, eyewitnesses claimed that the bus was moving at a very high speed. “The bus was speeding but we cannot say if it was a matter of negligent driving,” Shekhar said.
 
 The bus was ferrying 45 students, almost all of whom sustained minor injuries. Of them, 42 were given first aid and taken to the examination hall while three students with serious injuries were referred to   (RIMS). 
 
 School education and literacy department secretary Aradhana Patnaik said, “The students were given first aid and sent to exam centre. We had made special arrangement for them.” According to sources, three more students complained of illness at the exam centre and were rushed to RIMS.
 
 “A total of 39 students could take the examination. We will organise separate examination for the students who couldn’t appear today,” Patnaik said.
 
 She added, “If the driver is found to be at fault we will take action against the school authorities who hired the bus.”
