NEW DELHI: The health department of South Delhi Municipal Corporation has failed to check the quality of food provided in the canteens of 167 English and Hindi medium public schools putting thousands of students at a health risk. The chief auditor of municipal accounts has also revealed that these schools in Najafgarh zone were functioning without a licence.

 Though municipal health officials are supposed to inspect the hygiene and food quality at the canteens, no one has visited the schools for long, said a source. This issue had rocked the standing committee of   some time ago, but no actual action was taken.
 
 “Neither the canteen owners nor school authorities requested the SDMC health department to grant licences to run the units in the school premises. The health department didn’t even inspect the canteens,” says the latest audit report of the corporation. The auditor also warned that if the state of affairs do not improve, casualties cannot be ruled out.
 
 The auditors had brought the issue to the notice of the health department in August 2015, but the officials did not bother to respond, let alone initiate course correction. The absence of licences has resulted into a loss of Rs 5 lakh to the corporation.
 
 Dr B K Hazarika, medical health officer of south corporation, said that notices were issued to some schools a while ago. “We will look into the issue,” he told TOI.
 
 “Things in the corporation are in a mess, but children should not be made to pay for its carelessness,” said Ashok Agrawal of All India Parents’ Association.
