MANGALURU: The   (KEA) will commence NEET 2018   from Tuesday for  , who were earlier left out due to the domicile clause.

 This move comes after the SC nixed the   domicile rulefor postgraduate medical seats. Last Wednesday, the SC told the state to strike down the ‘Karnataka origin’ clause and issue the fresh notification for NEET PG admissions, for aspirants from outside the state. With this, thousands of aspirants, who completedtheir undergraduate education in Karnataka, and are seeking state quota in PG seats in medical/dental colleges, are eligible to get seats as per their NEET rankings.
 
 Dr Sachidanand, director, medical education department, Bengaluru, confirmed to TOI that fresh notifications will be uploaded on the KEA websites on Monday.
