NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday informed the Delhi   that it has hiked the salaries of prosecutors in Delhi to bring them on a par with their counterparts in other states. 

 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar then asked the Centre to file a compliance report.
 
 In September 2015, HC had directed the Delhi government to consider increasing pay scales of public prosecutors and to implement it without delay.
 
 Advocate Meera Bhatia, appearing for the Centre, informed the court that a three-member committee from three different ministries was constituted for taking the decision and the home ministry had agreed to give higher pay to the public prosecutors with effect from April 3, 2018.
 
 The contempt petition filed by Delhi Prosecutors Welfare Association alleged “deliberate and wilful disobedience” on the part of the Centre and the Delhi government in complying with the court’s 2015 order.
 
 The court was hearing two PILs seeking upward revision in the pay scale of prosecutors and for equipping them with facilities and infrastructure needed for the job. The court had earlier noted how the government lawyers or prosecutors could be expected to perform efficiently if they were not paid properly and on time.
 
 HC was earlier informed by senior advocate Rajeev K Virmani, the amicus curiae in the matter, that assistant prosecutors were being paid in the pay scale of Rs 9,300 to Rs 34,800 and for additional public prosecutors the grade pay was Rs 4,600 in pay band II as per the 6th Pay Commission, which was equivalent to what a stenographer received in district courts.
