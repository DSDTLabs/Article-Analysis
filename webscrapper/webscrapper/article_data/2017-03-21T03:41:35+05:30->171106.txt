NEW DELHI: Following instructions from the state election commission, the three civic bodies have launched a crackdown on illegal political hoardings, banners and posters across the capital. 

 In east Delhi alone, about 25,000 publicity materials were removed till Monday. These include 5,243 huge hoardings, 15,000 posters and 3,400 banners. “The campaign started on March 15, a day after SEC announced the municipal polls,” said an official. 
 
 According to civic officials, parties such as AAP,   and Congress had put up the illegal banners and posters in market places, flyovers, busy roads and lanes. They were used to woo voters in various municipal wards. 
 
 For instance, an   candidate had put up hundreds of posters in the Shakarpur market, asking people to remove garbage from Delhi using the broom, AAP’s symbol. In the same area, a Congress worker had used posters to request the voters to repose faith in the “experienced leadership” of his party. BJP too joined the race and pasted publicity materials in the market to promote its candidate.
 
 According to Mukesh Yadav, PRO of the south corporation, around 6,000 banners, hoardings and posters are removed from different locations in south Delhi every day. Even the north civic body has launched an extensive campaign against illegal political hoardings. “We have removed over 5,000 publicity materials in north Delhi since March 15,” said a north corporation official.
 
 The commissioners of the three corporations have asked their field staff to intensify the campaign. 
 
 An official claims most politicians avoid the legal way of advertising because it costs a fortune. “Each hoarding costs anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 3 lakh per month depending on the location. Among the costliest locations are Lajpat Nagar, Nehru Place, Saket, Dwarka, Chandni Chowk, Pitampura, Kamla Nagar, Rohini, Model Town and Karol Bagh.
