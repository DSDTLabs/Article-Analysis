RAIPUR:   state commission for women chairperson has written to the chief secretary recommending amendments in   to include punishment of dealth or rigorous imprisonment in case of rape or gang-rape of girl below 12 years of age. 

 After Haryana and Madhya Pradesh governments gave a nod to death penalty for rape with minors aged 12 or less, the chairperson of state women's commission Harshita Pandey has written to chief secretary recommending the same in Chhattisgarh too.
 
 Citing the decision of Haryana government in her letter, Pandey wrote that as of now, the punishment for rape of minors below 12 years of age is lifetime imprisonment but considering the rise in cases of rape of minors, the punishment should be amended to death penalty in state too. Bringing amendments in sections for rape under Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences, would surely ring down rape with minors. Like Haryana government, amendments like death punishment should be introduced to control incidents of rape with minors, the letter reads. Pandey asked the chief secretary to consider her recommendation and do the needful.
