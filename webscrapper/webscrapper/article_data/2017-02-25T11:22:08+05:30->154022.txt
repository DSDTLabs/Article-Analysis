BENGALURU: Even as the   and chief minister   were trying to come to terms on Friday with the release of a diary supposedly seized from MLC Govindaraj and which allegedly has incriminating evidence against  's ministers of having given money to the party high command, opposition parties have mounted pressure on the government to initiate action. 

 While the release of the diary extracts has caused confusion in the rank and file in the party,   leaders chose to buy time with the Mahashivarathri festival excuse.
 
  At the other end, a buoyant   state president   claimed that he will drop yet another bomb where incriminating evidence will be brought into the public forum against the Congress government, over misuse of BBMP funds to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore.
