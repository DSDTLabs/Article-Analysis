Udaipur: A 16-year-old boy who had cooked up a fake kidnapping story, fearing his parents may chide him for failing in board examinations, was detained by Udaipur police from a train at Nasirabad Junction. Police brought the boy to Goverdhan Vilas police station where his father had lodged his missing complaint a day ago. “The boy wasn’t abducted, he had appeared in the Class X board examinations and he feared that he would fail. Thus to avoid being scolding by his family, he cooked up a false story,” said SP Rajendra Prasad Goyal. The boy’s father, Rajesh Pandey, had said in the complaint that his son had left home around 3 pm on Saturday to meet him at his office but he didn’t reach there. The family tried to contact and search for him but in vain. They informed the police the same night. On Sunday morning, they received a call from the boy’s number. However, someone on the other side said that the boy has been kidnapped and would be released if a ransom of Rs 50 lakh is paid. “There was no third person involved, the boy had put a handkerchief and modulated his voice to speak in a different tone. He also downloaded a mobile application and called through it to get an international dialling number. When his father said that he could arrange for only Rs 3 lakh, the boy agreed,” Goyal said. During police investigation, the boy’s mobile location was traced to New Delhi. CCTV footages from Udaipur railway station showed the boy roaming alone on the platform thus confirming that there were no kidnappers involved. A police team was sent to Delhi to locate the boy, however, mobile locations revealed he had boarded the return train to Udaipur. Cops finally detained him on the train at Nasirabad.
