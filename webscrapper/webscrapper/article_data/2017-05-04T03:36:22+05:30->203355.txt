GURUGRAM: On Tuesday, when it courted limelight with the chief minister officially launching its  ,   also found itself dragged into a controversy when it was accused of denying entry to “shabbily dressed” kids.

 The post was written by a commuter, Shivanya Pandey, who referred to an episode she witnessed on May 1, just a day before the inauguration, to write on Facebook that four to six poor children had been denied into IndusInd Bank Cyber City Metro station because they were dressed shabbily and sweating even though they were paying the fares. She also emailed a complaint to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights
 
 Rapid Metro denied doing so, saying the kids had only been turned away because they could not buy tickets. “They were politely asked to go because they did not have the money for the fare,” said a spokesperson. “The criteria for travel in the Metro system, as per guidelines laid down by Metro Act, is for commuters to be able to furnish requisite fare either by token or valid travel card as well as comply with security guidelines. In this instance, the criteria wasn’t met. Rapid Metro does not discriminate towards any citizen and our teams are trained to treat all citizen commuters with respect and dignity,” the spokesperson added.
 
 But before that, Shivanya’s post had already elicited a strong reaction from women and child development minister Maneka Gandhi, who promised action and asked Delhi Metro managing director Mangu Singh to probe the incident.
 
 The DMRC later clarified that Rapid Metro does not come under it. Incidentally, around 30 penurious kids travelled with the   in the train on Tuesday during the inauguration of Phase 2. The chief minister said most of those kids had never travelled in a Metro train before.
