NEW DELHI: Renowned singer   withdrew on Monday her plea from the   challenging the   government’s decision to declare Jayprabha Studio in Kolhapur, which she owns, a heritage building.

 She had approached the   after the Bombay high court dismissed her plea. The Maharashtra government had, on December 29, 2012, passed an order declaring the studio a heritage structure. Mangeshkar moved court, arguing that on account of the heritage status, the studio could not be renovated, rebuilt or repaired.
 
 Bringing the over four-year legal dispute to an end, Lata’s advocate Vikas Mehta told a bench of Justice R F Nariman and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul that she was willing to withdraw her petition. The court allowed her plea.
 
 The singer had bought the 13-acre plot where the studio stands from renowned Marathi film-maker Bhalji Pendharkar in 1959. Pendharkar had bought the land from the erstwhile princely state of Kolhapur on the condition that it would be used to build a film studio.
 
 In court, Lata had submitted that, in violation of regulations, no heritage conservation committee was constituted for Kolhapur city by the civic body or the deputy town planning director before the studio received heritage status. She added that she was given no notice before the decision was taken, as is required under the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act.
 
 However, the HC observed that the she had sufficient notice, and that only inference possible was that she did not file any objections.
