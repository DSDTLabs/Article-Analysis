BENGALURU:   sleuths from the Criminal Investigation Department have busted a marketing and phishing racket, and arrested four persons from Jharkhand.

 Details of 16,000 bank accounts and 460 Sim cards have been recovered from the quartet, which includes two siblings. The fraudsters allegedly hosted fake websites offering to sell products at deep discounts and pay high interest on deposits.
 
 They indulged in bottom phishing, where small sums are siphoned off from bank accounts of a large number of victims. “The accused hoped the victims would not approach police as the amounts they lost were small,” said MD Sharath, deputy superintendent of police.
 
 Kapil Dev Suman alias Ajai Singh, 26 and his brother Sushil Kumar Suman, 24, were arrested in Bengaluru; Sooraj Kumar, 25 and Biplav Kumar, 24 were picked up from Patna.
