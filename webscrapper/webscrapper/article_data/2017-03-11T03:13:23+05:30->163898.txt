NEW DELHI: ‘The Trump Card’ was originally scheduled to be performed at SGTB   a day after the  . But it was postponed over security concerns. On Thursday, it finally found an audience at ‘DU ke Mann ki Baat’, a protest. 

 A political satire by a theatre group called Ankur, the play, however, ran with a disclaimer that it wasn’t part of the stir. 
 
 Aastha Narang, president of Ankur, said, “We only knew that a programme to bring together all colleges of DU was being organised. Only after we came here did we get to know that it was a protest.”
 
 She added, “I have no idea which organisation is behind the protest or what its ideals are. So, I want to make sure this play and the group remains independent of that.”
 
 The play depicted the current atmosphere in the country through some actions and sounds. Narang said no restrictions were imposed on them. 
 
 Prashant Mukherji, president of Student Federation of India, however, said the protest was not organised under the banner of any particular organisation. 
 
 “It was organised by a few members of SFI, but not under our banner. Our intention was to bring in all colleges and speakers of DU who want to talk about issues but cannot because of various reasons,” said Mukherji. 
 
 The protest was short-lived, though, and Mukherji blamed last-minute change of venue for the low turnout.
 
  “We were supposed to have the protest at the Law Faculty but they asked us to move it to the Metro station because Subramanian Swamy was to speak there. Also, after the event started, movement was restricted and we were barricaded from all sides. Besides that, a lot of students have gone home for Holi. We were mindful of it, but the momentum of the movement had to be maintained too,” said Mukherji.
