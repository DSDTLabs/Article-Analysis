NEW DELHI: Former youth   leader  , who is undergoing life term in the sensational murder case of his wife  , was granted three weeks parole on Wednesday by the Delhi high court.

 Justice   granted parole, enabling Sharma to take care of his ailing parents.The convict had sought six months parole.
 
 Sharma in his plea had al so challenged November 28, 2016 order of the Delhi government rejecting his application for regular parole. He said the government rejected his application on “false and fictitious“ ground and the authorities did not appreciate the fact that he was eligible for grant of parole.
 
 Sharma had said his application should have been allowed by the authorities “considering the health and age of his parents“ as he is the only son to look after them. He also said he has never misused the concession of parole or furlough granted to him earlier.
