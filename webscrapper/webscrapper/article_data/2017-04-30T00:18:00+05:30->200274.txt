Pimpri Chinchwad: Over a dozen social organisations from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad will come together for a tree-plantation drive in the Dighi hill area in Pimpri Chinchwad on May 1, jump-starting their five-year plan to convert the hillock into a mini forest.

 There are two hills located along the Pune-Alandi Road in Dighi. The social organisations will plant saplings on one side of the bigger hill facing the road. 
 
 The hillock falls under defence land, but people can access its road-facing side as the army tests weapons on the other side of the hill.
 
 Santosh Gadhave, member of Cycle Mitra told TOI, “Many of our members from Pimpri Chinchwad cycle up to the Ghoradeshwar hill and temple located ahead of Dehu Road along the Pune-Mumbai highway. We decided to develop a similar spot in Pimpri Chinchwad where we can also nurture a mini forest.”
 
 A 20-member group from Pimpri Chinchwad comprising businessmen, IT professionals, industrialists, industrial employees and others has been formed for the project. “They have been visiting the spot every Sunday for the past three months and digging trenches to collect rainwater for the saplings to be planted before the rainy season,” Gadhave added.
 
 Nilesh Londhe of Bhosari brings the digging equipment in his car every week which is used by the volunteers to dig trenches. “The digging work begins at 6.30am and continues for an hour. We have dug up around 20 trenches parallel to the road which are around 1.5 to 2 feet deep. We will plant as many as 2,500 saplings of indigenous species along these trenches,” Gadhave added.
