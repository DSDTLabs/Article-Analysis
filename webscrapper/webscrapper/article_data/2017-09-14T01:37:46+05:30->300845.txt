NEW DELHI: The Delhi government will bring in a new set of rules for   vehicles operating as   in the city to ensure safety of schoolchildren. Schools will also be made   to monitor if private vans ferrying their students are following the norms.

 Last time the Delhi government had formulated guidelines was a decade ago, when it brought the School Cab Policy 2007. “The 2007 policy has now become old. It will now be changed into rules, which will be stringently enforced,” said a senior government official.
 
 In the wake of the recent murder of an seven-year-old boy in Gurgaon’s   and alleged rape of a five-year-old in a school in Shahdara, the Delhi government has formed a high-level committee chaired by the Directorate of Education (DoE) director. The committee, which includes school principals, police officers and other stakeholders as members, also comprise transport department officials. It will frame guidelines for not only the safety of students in schools but also safety during transportation from and to schools.
 
 “We are also working out a system through which some responsibility would be put on schools to monitor these private vans. Though schools also have limited resources, but it is also not possible for the transport department to check each and every private school van,” the official added.
 
 “Many schools don’t provide transport facilities to their students, compelling parents to depend on private school vans. As these vans are not operated by schools and don’t enter school premises, schools tend to avoid taking any responsibility for them,” a transport department official said.
