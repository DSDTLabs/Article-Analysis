AHMEDABAD: How well do you know your partner? All it took was just few minutes for a man to discover his wife had already married to three other men, in fact.

 Rajubhai, a businessman from Ahmedabad, filed a cheating complaint with city police after he overheard his wife discussing her previous marriages on phone.
 
 "In 2013, I met my wife Pinky on a matrimonial site and got married in the same year. In second year of our marriage we were blessed with a baby boy,"   told Police.
 
 "Pinky had written never married on a matrimonial website but after three years of marriage, I discovered she was married three times and is still not legally divorced from her previous husband," he said. 
 
 He also claimed, in his police complaint, that Pinky is demanding cash and property from him and is also threatening to kill their son.
 
 "After fight, Pinky left along with our son to her parent's place in Mumbai," he said, adding, "During our courtship period her parents insisted to plan wedding at an earliest. Which was beyond our understanding but still we got married in the same year."
