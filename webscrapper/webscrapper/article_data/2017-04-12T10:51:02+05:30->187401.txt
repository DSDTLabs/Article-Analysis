Bathinda: Onkar Nath Budhwar, a former spy who was released from Pakistan more than four decades ago, has asked the Indian authorities to fight the case of former naval officer   at the international fora.

 Budhwar, 67, a resident of   village near Faridkot, too faced a similar situation when he was awarded a death sentence in 1972 by the Sahiwal sessions court. He got a lucky reprieve as he was released on December 9, 1974 under the Simla Agreement.
 
 Jadhav has been awarded death sentence in Pakistan for alleged involvement in espionage and sabotage activities.
 
 Budhwar, who now runs a small grocery shop at his village, on Tuesday said, “The Indian government must do everything to ensure release of Jadhav, and must use its influence for his release for at least commuting the death sentence.” He also said the Union government should also ensure rehabilitation of former spies who wasted their best period in various jails in other countries.
 
 Budhwar, who has also worked for many years as a clerk with some advocates at the Faridkot district courts, said he had crossed over to Pakistan twice at the age of 18 in 1968. He was arrested when he tried to enter Pakistan for the third time for spying at Jajjasadu post.
 
 He was tortured and awarded death sentence by the Sahiwal court. In December 1974, then Pakistani prime minister   ordered Budhwar’s release under the Simla Agreement.
 
 He said the governments never cared for his rehabilitation, though he had worked for India. “Now the Union government must stand by Jadhav and go to international powers for his release,” he said.
