MUMBAI: Were some   officials of G-South ward responsible for the   which killed 14 persons?   think so. Highly-placed sources said police are likely to probe the role of   in the culpable homicide case.

 Police said they came across few civic officials who sat on files without taking action. While 1Above was found to be using more than 70% of its actual licensed area illegally, Mojo was using 50% illegally. Both hotels were offering hookah despite a Supreme Court order. Police said both hotels had got conditional fire brigade NOCs, and BMC and the fire brigade had failed to conduct fire audits of them.
 
 Police said they were seeking evidence against five civic officials, including an assistant divisional fire officer, who civic chief Ajoy Mehta had suspended. Police said they will be booked for negligence, dereliction of duty and corruption. If so, it it will be first case where civic officials will be held liable for illegal constructions.
 
 “Our probe will also cover how these restaurants got various permissions and how they ignored BMC notices. We strongly suspect that few officers were hand-in-glove with the hoteliers,” said an IPS officer. He added that they were seeking legal opinion.
 
 N M Joshi Marg police said they had procured the notices served to the hotels over two years. Police said prima facie, the ward office issued several notices of illegalities to both but still the two resto-bars and few others in the vicinity carried out business.
