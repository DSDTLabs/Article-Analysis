Salem: A 29-year-old autorickshaw driver was hacked to death at Maniyanur in Salem city on Friday. 

 The deceased, identified as P Govindaraj of Kondalampatty, was also running a grocery outlet, police sources said. “He was also involved in kangaroo courts and lottery business. Govindaraj was married to Saranyadevi and also was in a relationship with a minor girl. Saranyadevi has two children while the later is pregnant. On Friday morning, Govindaraj took Saranyadevi to a local hospital after she fell ill. After dropping her home, he got a call and left home on his motorcycle. Within a few hours, passersby found him dead on the mud road close to the Maniyanur burial ground. He had suffered deep cuts on his forehead, neck and chest,” a police officer with the Annadhanapatty police station said.
 
 Govindaraj was hacked to death while he was riding the two-wheeler, police said. They are verifying CCTV footages to identify the culprit.
 
 “We suspect the murderers to be relatives of one of his wives or those affected due to kangaroo courts,” the officer added.
