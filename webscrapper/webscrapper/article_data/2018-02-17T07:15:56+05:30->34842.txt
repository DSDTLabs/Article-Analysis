NEW DELHI: For the river water dispute that became synonymous with riots and chauvinistic politics over three decades, it was a surprise that CM   welcomed the  's decision on apportioning the Cauvery waters between   and  .

 
 If it was counter-intuitive for the government in the middle of a bitter re-election battle to celebrate the Cauvery award, it was indicative of the fact that the apex court may have capped a long festering problem, at least in this political cycle.
 
 Tamil Nadu is bound to witness political upmanship over the Cauvery award as the opposition DMK would seek to corner the tottering, post-Jayalalithaa AIADMK government over relief to the neighbouring state. But it was Karnataka that had appeared vulnerable in the run-up to the decision.
 
 The volatile mix of Karnataka's history of politics of victimhood, its high water demands and presence of a regional party in JD(S) appeared to have been rendered more volatile by the ongoing bitter campaign for assembly elections. Cauvery and politics have for years come with a sense of foreboding.
 
 But as Friday passed off peacefully and the inter-state bus service resumed after a precautionary pause, signals from the ruling Congress were that the party can go to the polls without looking over its shoulder on how the wily Deve Gowda or the BJP would play the court verdict.
 
 "We can project it as a victory which we may ultimately not. But what is a relief for the government is that no other party can project it as a defeat," a Siddaramaiah aide said. With the estimate that Cauvery would not be the imponderable that could tilt the political scales in April, the intractable dispute seems headed for a rare post-award calm.
