The  , very much like the real world, has a dark side to it. And by dark side, it’s not just adult websites that we’re talking about, but something even bigger and more complex. Commonly known as the  , it is a virtual underworld where everything is anonymous and unmonitored, far, far away from the prying eyes of intelligence and law enforcement agencies across the globe. Drug dealing, arms trading, hacking, prostitution,  , scams, frauds, terrorism and many such malicious activities are transacted anonymously via the dark web, which is a part of intricate networks of the  .

 
 
 A vast section of the internet is not accessible through popular search engines. This part of the Internet is known as the deep web, and it is close to 500 times the size of the Web that we are familiar with. The deep web data — user databases, registration-required web forums, webmail pages, paywall-protected pages — are not indexed by search engines such as Google and Yahoo, and therefore cannot be found by simple search functions. Dark web is much smaller than the deep web and is made up of all different kinds of websites that sell drugs, weapons and counterfeit currency. All these transactions take place in   markets.
 
 
 
 Transactions in the darknet markets — hacking or sale of drugs, arms, confidential information, etc. in exchange for money or information — are kept anonymous and untraceable with the help of darknet softwares such as Tor, which are not illegal but their use can arouse suspicion. Such softwares conceal users' identities and their online activity from surveillance by encrypting and then randomly bouncing communications through networks around the globe. Additionally, the encryption happens in a multi-layered manner, providing users with more anonymity.
 
 
 
 Because online payment gateways leave a digital footprint, normal currency cannot be used to make payments while trading on the darknet markets. That’s where crypto-currencies come into play — digital currencies that use cryptography to work as a medium of exchange. Digital currencies such as  , Ethereum, Ripple, Monero and ZCash have no physical form but have value — for example, those five have a combined market cap of $25 billion as of yesterday.
 
 While recent surveys show that close to 60% of the dark web is occupied by unauthorized contents like pornography, illicit finances, drug hub, weapons trafficking, counterfeit currency flow and more, what it really is, is a very large pool of information. However, due to its anonymous nature, most of it is used for illegal activities. While Governments across the world constantly try to monitor and regulate the deep web, one thing is certain — there’s a lot that is hidden from public eyes in the vast, vast world of the Internet.
