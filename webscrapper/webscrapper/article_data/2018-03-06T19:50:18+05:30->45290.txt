‘Pari’, the Bollywood horror flick starring   in the lead, has opened to a lukewarm response at the domestic box-office. The spookfest reportedly earned an estimated Rs 4 crore nett on its opening day at the ticket window, according to a report on BoxofficeIndia.com.

 
 
 
 The film saw a better opening than Anushka’s previous home production ‘Phillauri’ which grossed 3.86 crore nett. Commended for sticking genuinely to the horror theme over sheer succession of scary sequences, this film is looking forward to continuing to spook fans over the extended holiday weekend.
 
 While the film is looking forward to redefining the genre with its “refreshingly different” content and provide enough thrills and chills to its views, the film will not see the light of day in Pakistan. According to latest reports, ‘Pari’ will not release in the neighbouring country as it reportedly "Mixed Quranic verses with Hindu chants and also portrayed Muslims in a negative light as they were shown using Quranic verses to do black magic," said a source at Pakistan's Central Board of Film Certification.
 
 
 
 
 Starring Anushka Sharma,Rajat Kapoor, Ritabhari Chakraborty, Dibyendu Bhattacharya, Parambrata Chatterjee, the film released nationwide on March 2.
