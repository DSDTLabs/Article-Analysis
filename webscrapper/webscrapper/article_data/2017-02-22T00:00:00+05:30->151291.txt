It was through her friend   that   got to know about the vaccination and   drive happening in Kaloor, Kochi. However, she could “instantly identify’’ with the cause, she says. “Firstly, I’m disturbed by the amount of torture Ranjini Haridas goes through for working for the cause of animals. I completely understand the cause and   it. But unfortunately I don’t find much love lost between humans in our State, let alone for pets.”

  In the US, where she lives on and off for her treatment, it would seem like people care more for their pets than humans, she says. “Jokes apart, human life is valued highly there, so is animal life. The kind of care they bestow on the animals is amazing. In Los Angeles where I live, almost every home has a pet, mostly dogs. For single people, their pets are their friends and trusted companions and they hold dogathons and all kinds of activities for their pets.”
 Since she is not in India she was not able to extend her help for the cause personally but she lauds the adoption drive held at Kaloor. “I love animals and have always wanted to have a pet, but unfortunately I keep travelling to and from the US and live in apartments.”
 
 Adopting a dog is the best possible thing one can do, as they give so much in return, she says. “I have always felt that stray dogs can be trained as service dogs, and as pet dogs, but for that, we have to first build a culture of respecting and loving them. Every single step is a step ahead, let’s hope the adoption drive paves the way for a bigger change.”
