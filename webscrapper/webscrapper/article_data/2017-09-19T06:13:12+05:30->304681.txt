AHMEDABAD: Dissent among the members of one of the   –   – continued to brew against the current president and his panel. Club sources said that some 122 members out of 155 who were present at the club’s annual general meeting (AGM) on Sunday, passed a no-confidence motion. However, club president   has set aside the allegations and said that the   was conducted as usual.

 Insiders in the club said that the mandate has not gone well with the existing members who allege that the election process lacks transparency. “After the candidates had filled their nominations by September 10 and the withdrawal of forms took place on September 11 – names of the candidates who were contesting were not declared. We are yet to receive any written communication from the club’s management explaining reasons for rejection of forms,” said a source.
 
 Top sources in the club also said members are also bothered by the fact that despite the no confidence motion in the AGM, the board members have not left office.
 
 Commenting on the issue, Sheikh said, “The AGM was conducted as usual and the no-confidence motion was not passed. In fact, the terms of the last year’s AGM were read out and it was mentioned that six board members have been elected uncontested.”
