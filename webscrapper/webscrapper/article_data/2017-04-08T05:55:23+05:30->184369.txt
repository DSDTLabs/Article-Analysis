THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A 10-member central team led by joint secretary of   Ashwani Kumar will visit the state by the third week of April to review the drought situation and discuss the utilization of the  . 

 Based on the extent of damage to people, crops and soil, the team would decide whether it is normal or severe and based on that it would be decided whether the current allotment is sufficient or whether the state will require additional funds, said  .
 
 Kerala expects a   of Rs 992.5 crore and had already submitted a proposal for that. Now, from the sanctioned central fund of Rs 24,000 crore for the eight drought-hit states in the country, Kerala expects a minimum of Rs 500 crore as wages for the workers in affected rural areas.
 
 The officials said that they expect additional central support of about Rs 1000 crore.
 
 "Kerala had declared itself drought-hit on October 31, last year, as the state received 34% less rain during the monsoon and 62% less rain during northeast monsoon in 2016. In the state's request for central support, it had also sought for increasing the human days of work for the rural household in the drought hit state and to ensure proper civil supplies including provision of free food grains and kerosene to the residents in affected areas," said officials of Kerala state disaster management authority (KSDMA).
 
 Accepting that, the Centre had increased the work for the rural household from the existing 100 human days to 150 human days under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).
 
 With that, the funds will go directly to the affected people.
