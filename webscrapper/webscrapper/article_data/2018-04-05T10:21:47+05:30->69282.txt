KOLKATA: Chief minister   has deferred her visit to Chennai, earlier scheduled on April 10, in view of the West Bengal rural elections on May 1, 3 and 5. 

 On Wednesday, the CM said she would visit Chennai after the polls. She plans to meet DMK chief M Karunanidhi to firm up the pan-India anti-BJP alliance before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, for which she may also meet opposition leaders in Lucknow. 
 
 Nabanna sources said Banerjee also wants to avoid the Cauvery water-sharing controversy in Tamil Nadu. She had earlier planned to stay in Chennai for a few days after meeting Karunanidhi.
 
 It may also be mentioned that the opposition in Bengal is alleging that Trinamool Congress is preventing the opposition, particularly BJP candidates, from filing nominations. BJP leader   on Wednesday said his party would move the   for deployment of central forces during panchayat polls.
 
 A senior official said the CM would not stay out of the state while the opposition is claiming misrule by her government. During her recent trip to New Delhi, she had met Sonia Gandhi and other opposition leaders, including NCP chief Sharad Pawar.
