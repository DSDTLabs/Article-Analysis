Pimpri Chinchwad: The Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner, Shravan Hardikar, has sent letters to all corporators, warning them that they will face disqualification if they supported unauthorized constructions or interfered in the drive against illegal constructions.

 The civic body will conduct a demolition drive against unauthorized constructions. Speaking to TOI, Hardikar said, “Cautionary letters have been sent to corporators. We will video-record the drive and use the footage as evidence.”
