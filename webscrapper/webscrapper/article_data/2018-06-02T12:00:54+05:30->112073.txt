INDORE: Eleven convicts were transferred from   to different jails across the state. 

 All director generals of prisons had been asked by SC to submit plans to decongest jails in their respective states. DGP Jail   had plans to decongest Indore Central and district jail, which are currently exceeding sanctioned limit of inmates by 45% and 56% respectively. "We had received complaints about some of the inmates and some problems were being witnessed, so they were transferred to different districts," said  , central jail superintendent. He added that this is usually done in order to prevent inmates from creating a network inside jail. "Once we start getting numerous complaints against any particular inmate, he is blacklisted and then actions are initiated," he said.
 
 The convicts were sent to Gwalior, Satna, Rewa, Ratlam and Barwani among others. 
 
 In a similar action, Central jail has also received two inmates from   jail. 
 
 Several cases of fights among inmates had also been reported since past few weeks which were a trigger for the action by superintendent. 
 
 Indore central jail is crowded with 45% extra inmates and the only way is segregating convicts and undertrials and shifting them to sub-jails but the plan seems to be farfetched. 
 
 In 2013, the officials had tried to reduce the number of inmates at Central jail by dividing Indore division into two parts and introducing a Central jail in Barwani. Following this, the number of inmates in Indore Central jail came down from 2700 to 2100.
