NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old youth and two of his younger   sustained gunshot injuries after a man tried to intervene in a fight, but when asked to leave them alone, he opened fire. The incident took place in northwest   late on Monday and the accused has been identified.

 Police said that a witness made a PCR call. Soon, a team reached the spot and the victims were taken to a hospital, where they were given treatment and two of them were discharged on Tuesday.
 
 Police said, a fight ensued between two brothers, Subodh and Pramod, near their house. Hearing them fight, a crowd gathered around them. One local, Lokesh, tried to intervene, but seeing him picking on them, the brothers asked him to stay away. Agitated by the insult, Lokesh pulled out a country-made pistol and shot at Subodh.
 
 He was injured on his thigh, cops said. Two teenagers, Subodhâ€™s cousins, who were standing beside Subodh when the firing took place, were hit by the bullet pellets.
 
 DCP (northwest) Aslam Khan said that they will arrest the accused at the earliest.
