Nagpur: An independent country needs symbols like an anthem, its language and national song which are descriptive of its identity, culture and traditions. In India, these symbols were chosen consciously though there were many political overtones involved while finalizing them, said Sharad Ponkshe, renowned actor and thinker, on Saturday.

 Ponkshe was speaking at a symposium organized by Raisoni Group’s SGR Knowledge Foundation at Chitnavis Centre. The talk was organized to create awareness among the youth about lesser known subjects through lectures, one topic at a time.
 
 Ponkshe threw light on many incidences from pre and post-independence period that lead to shaping a country and its national symbols as we know them today. 
 
 He spoke at length on how Hindi, or Devnagiri script to be specific, was chosen to be India’s national language. “After declaration of Hindi as national language, ambiguity prevailed in regions like Lucknow which had Mughal influence, and Urdu words were liberally used. The leaders of that time had to modify the decision and Devnagiri became the national script,” he said.
 
 “Vande Mataram, a patriotic song written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, ignited many a mind and became a rage during the freedom struggle. But the song faced stiff opposition from the Muslim community of that time as it compared the mother earth (nation) with Hindu goddesses. Anticipating that it would result into political repercussions, the policymakers selected ‘Jana gana mana’, written by Rabindranath Tagore, as the national anthem,” Ponkshe said.
 
 All humans, irrespective of caste, creed, race or culture are made from five elements of mother nature — bhoomi, vayu, aap, tej and aakash. Hence, respecting the fellow human beings is our foremost religion, he added.
 
 He talked about how all religions are rooted deep with our mother nature and drew parallels between faiths.
