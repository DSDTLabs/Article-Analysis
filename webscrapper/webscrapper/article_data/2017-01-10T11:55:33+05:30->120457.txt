ROORKEE: Police on Monday   manufacturing unit in   and arrested two persons as part of its drive against the menace of illicit country-made alcohol during the poll season. “We have arrested two persons-- Sonu and Pravin-- and recovered   from their possession on Monday. The accused were running an illegal factory of hooch from in Peetpur,” said AS Rawat, circle officer (CO) of Laksar.
 The police action is seen as a preventive measure, as the polls in the state are close.

  “Our aim is to make the polls free from hooch makers and illegal traders. We will continue crackdowns on such offenders as our priority,” said Mishra.
  The rural belt of Haridwar district, especially the interior areas of Laksar, Manglaur and Bhagwan is reportedly known to be the safe havens for manufacturing of illegal country-made liquor.
