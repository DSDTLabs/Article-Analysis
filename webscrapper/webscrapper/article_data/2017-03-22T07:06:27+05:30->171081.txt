LUCKNOW: The information commission has asked   to explain under what rules and by whose permission has the authority allowed weddings and other events to be organised at   in Gomtinagar.

 In December 2015, Lucknow resident Aslam Siddiqui had filed a   ( ) application with the Sports Directorate, seeking information about the rules under which weddings and other celebrations were being held at Academy. He had filed a complaint with UPSIC after he was not given that information. 
 
 Deputy director of sports directorate RN Singh said Siddiquiâ€™s application had been transferred to LDA. The commission has directed LDA to respond to the applicant. 
 
 About 10 acres of land were allotted to the Academy by LDA in 1999 for the promotion of sports.
