NEW DELHI: Delhi police seized Rs 6 crore in   from a   in west Delhi’s Janakpuri on Tuesday night. Cops suspect that the accused might have been involved in exchanging the   notes against valid currencies.

 Officials said that a raid was conducted after cops received a tip-off. The notes were found to be stuffed inside several bags and kept in one of the bedrooms. The IT department was informed following the raid.
 
 Cops said that the accused, Anil Jain (35), ran a chit-fund company and has been detained for further questioning. Sleuths suspect that the money belonged to a hawala operator. “The Income Tax department will conduct further inquiry into the source of the notes,” said a senior police officer.
 
 “The accused used to charge a 50% commission on the amount he exchanged. He had hired a cash van to transport the money elsewhere as he was expecting the cops to raid his place,” added the police officer.
