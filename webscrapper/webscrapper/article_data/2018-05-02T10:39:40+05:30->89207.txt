NEW DELHI: For a beleaguered franchise like  , whose campaign in   has seen them stumble from one defeat to another, victory over Mumbai Indians in front of their home fans at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru was a big plus point, for it took the franchise to fifth on the leaderboard and kept alive their play-off hopes. 

 
 
 
 For   skipper   - no doubt a relieved man after his team managed to defend a middling total of 167/7 - the win was a bit sweeter than others for it came on his wife Anushka Sharma’s 30th birthday. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Speaking to the television presenter following RCB’s 14-run win over the defending champions on Tuesday night, Kohli said: “My wife is here and it's her birthday. This was a little gift for her. It was very important to achieve this two points in front of her.”
 
  
  
 
 Sharma has been the subject of insensitive trolling on Twitter in recent times, with irate fans blaming the Bollywood star for RCB’s poor form (they recently languished at the bottom of the   2018 points table).
