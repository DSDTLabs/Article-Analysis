KOLKATA: The state government on Thursday assured the 250-odd single-screen theatre exhibitors that their   rebate will be refunded to them by next month. 

  chairman Krishna Daga told TOI, "On Monday, we were assured the GST issue, which had become a huge stumbling block for Bengal exhibitors, will be resolved. At least Rs 10 crore has to be refunded to the exhibitors. The Times of India has been constantly highlighting this issue. We are happy our problems have been heard and the government has taken a proactive stand." 
 
 On Thursday morning, EIMPA officials met commercial and agricultural income tax commissioner Smaraki Mahapatra. "She gave us a verbal assurance that the entire GST rebate will be refunded by March 15. In the previous taxation scheme, exhibitors had given pre-paid taxes to the government. We've been told this issue will also be taken care of," Daga said.
 
 Producer-exhibitor Ashok Dhanuka said, "I own four cinema halls and do the programming for 14 others. This great initiative by the state government is a big boost for  ." Dipankar Bose, who owns   in Balurghat, welcomed the refund move: "I'd ideally like the government to scrap this rebate system to the cine-goers. Let them take the full GST and as a state assistance, give the 7% to the cinema halls." EIMPA exhibitors' section Ratan Saha, said the Bengal exhibitors are happy. "I own four theatres in Bengal and Tripura. Exhibitors have been asked to send the details of our claims. We would want this system of collecting GST to be overhauled," Saha said.
