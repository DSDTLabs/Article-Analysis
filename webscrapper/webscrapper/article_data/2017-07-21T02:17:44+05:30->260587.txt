Gurgaon: School in monsoon isn’t just about doing their homework on time for hundreds of students of the   in  . They must also learn to balance themselves across 200 metres of slushy, slippery terrain that makes their flat shoes and chappals seem like roller skates.

 Thursday was such a day. It rained in the morning, and the school’s unrepaired approach   turned into a  , taking the campus virtually out of bounds for all students. A few brave ones made it, after treading gingerly, but the mud-stained uniforms bore marks of their ordeal. 
 
 “We have to put up with this now,” said Chandni, a student of Class 11. “No matter how much we try to avoid the dirt, it sticks to us. By the time we reach school, it looks as though we fought in the mud.”
 
  
  According to students, they have been facing this for over a year, every time it rains. “The problem is compounded on days like today when it rain in the morning time. Had it been noon or evening, the road would have dried out a bit the next day,” said Ritu, another student.
 
 The school is located on the Kadarpur road, leading to the Badshapur village. It is the only girls’ school in the area, principal Firdous Khan said. There is just once access road to the school. “Even autos and cabs refuse to ply on this stretch during rains,” Khan said.
 
 According to Khan, the road was dismantled last year by the public works department for a makeover. But the rebuilding process had been slow. “So whenever it rains, the road turns slushy and dangerous for commute,” the principal said. “My students are forced to walk. Some of them fall and the mud dirties their uniforms.”
 
 Rao Narbir Singh, the Badshapur MLA and state PWD minister, said repair of the road had not been stopped. “We stopped the laying of tar due to monsoon rains. When monsoon ends, we will start work again.” He said it would take around a month for the road to be fully made.
