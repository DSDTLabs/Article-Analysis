CHENNAI: The   on Tuesday lashed out at   for not including the   at an official event, saying it was “completely wrong”.

 Senior AIADMK leader and fisheries minister   said irrespective of whether it was a central or state government institution, it was a “tradition” to play the Tamil Thaai Vazhthu (prayer invoking Tamil mother), as well as the national anthem.
 
 “The Amma (former chief minister  ) government will never accept anything that is tantamount to throwing away such traditions,” he told reporters in the city. The explanation from the IIT-M management on the issue was “not acceptable,” he added.
 
 Rendering of a Sanskrit invocation song at an event at IIT-M, attended by Union ministers   and   on Monday, had triggered a controversy with some opposition parties, including   and MDMK, questioning why the Tamil anthem was not sung.
 
 More than 50 members of Tamil Maanila Congress and the Campus Front of India were arrested and later released for staging protests in front of IIT-M on Tuesday morning.
 
 ‘Maha Ganapathim Manasa Smarami’ was sung at the start of the foundation stone laying ceremony for the National Technology Centre for Ports, Waterways and Coasts. IIT-M director Bhaskar Ramamoorthy had later clarified that the institution does not issue any directions to students for a particular song to be sung.
 
 The BJP’s state unit slammed those criticising the singing of the Sanskrit song. “People can make out what is constructive politics and what is hate politics,”   state president Tamilisai Soundarajan said. Opposition parties were making it an issue “since they can survive only using the language,” she charged.
 
 Pon Radhakrishnan sought to steer clear of the controversy. “I was under the impression that Tamil Thaai Vazthu was sung. But I was not aware of it as I arrived late for the function and left before it was over,” he told reporters in Ramanathapuram.
