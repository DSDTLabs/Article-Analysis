PUNE: The junior college student, who mowed down 15-year-old helmetless scooter rider   at Famous Chowk in New Sangvi on Monday evening, was arrested early on Tuesday from another friend’s house, where he hid after the accident as he was terrified. He was later let off on bail. 

 His parents were unable to contact him as he had switched off his cellphone. On Monday, an irate mob of about 200 people had gathered outside the police station demanding the student’s arrest. 
 
 Police traced the car owner and later ascertained the identity of the driver. “We arrested him in the early hours of Tuesday from his friend’s house. He was first taken to hospital as his blood pressure had shot up,” an officer from the Sangvi police said.
 
 The student, who lives in New Sangvi, had gone to his friend’s house near   when he saw the car with the key in the ignition. Sub-inspector Amit Shete said the student quickly got into the car and told two other minor boys to occupy the backseat. 
 
 When the student started the car, his friend rushed to stop him. “Assuming the friend would not let him take the car, the youth accelerated. At the turn of the road, the student lost control due to the high speed and knocked Om down,” Shete said.
 
 The impact was such that Om was flung into the air and dragged along with the car over some distance. He died on the spot. The college student did not stop after the accident.
 
 Local residents rushed Om to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brought dead. His body was taken to Karmala for the last rites. Om’s uncle Sudhakar Shitole lodged a complaint with the Sangvi police. 
 
 Shete said the youth’s parents told the police that he had gone out to play with his friends on Monday evening. “His father is an employee of a private company, while his mother is a home-maker,” the officer said.
