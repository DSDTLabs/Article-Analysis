THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP state president   and three other senior BJP leaders said they would not accept the ' ' cover offered to them by the Centre. "We don't need any special security when there is no protection to the lives and properties of common BJP workers. Our decision has been conveyed to the Union government," Kummanam said. 

 Revealing the party decision to forgo the special security cover, which the Centre recently offered to the BJP state president, national executive member P K Krishnadas, general secretaries M T Ramesh and K Surendran, Kummanam told reporters here on Friday that the decision was taken in view of the murder of a BJP worker in Kannur on Wednesday.
 
 Both CPM and the police are trying to hunt down BJP workers, he alleged. The Union home ministry has recently decided to provide Y category security to the four leaders following intelligence reports that they were facing threat from terror organizations. The security threat to Kummanam and others came to surface when the security agencies questioned those who were taken into custody for alleged ISIS links from Kanakamala in Kannur district.
 
 The Y category security cover consists 11-member security personnel, including one or two commandos. 
 
  Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala had earlier criticised the Union home ministry's move to provide Y category security to the four BJP leaders. He claimed that the centre's decision to provide security to the leaders directly was against the basic principles of federalism. "If at all they face any security threat, they should have informed the state police about the same and the centre could have intervened only if the state failed to provide necessary security to them,'' he had claimed.
