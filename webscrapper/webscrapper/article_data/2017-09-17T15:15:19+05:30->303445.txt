When they started protesting on August 5, little did the students of   (KIoSS) expect the matter to go to court. However, after around 20 days, the authorities of the institute have filed a case against 17 students of the Master of Social Work (MSW) course, who have been demanding their hostel accommodation back.

 The protest started when the 12 students signed up for a private accommodation, arranged for by the institute, but changed their mind after they started having issues with its owner. Since then, the students have been living in a tent in the campus situated on the hill slope at   road.
 
 Following the filing of a case, student organisations from the city have come forward to support the protest. Even alumni, who have been supporting the students, are disturbed with the institute’s decision to file a case against the students.  , an ex-student of the institute, said, “The issues can be solved by discussion but the management has filed a case against the students who have been protesting silently. 
 
 If the management is taking the matter outside the campus, then student organisations can also join the students. If the institute is not ready for an open dialogue, then we will be taking a decision about the same in the next couple of days.”
 Since they have been residing in tents for over a month, some students have started facing health issues too. Neha Rane, a student, said, “Some have migraines while others have become weak. Some are also suffering from low blood pressure.” According to students, the nearby area is home to a lot of snakes as well and some have been found near the tents of late. Neha added, “Despite problems, we are going to continue the protest. We want to resolve the matter with discussion.”
 
 We spoke to  , a trustee of the institute, who confirmed that a civil case has been filed against the students, but denied commenting on the issue. “The matter is subjudice, so I cannot comment on it,” he said.
