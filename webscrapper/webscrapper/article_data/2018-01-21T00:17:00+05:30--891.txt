Jaipur: Shree Rajput Karni Sena on Saturday said that it has received a letter from Bhansali Productions requesting them to set aside their ‘misguided grievances’ and watch the film Padmaavat.

 Sena patron Lokendra Singh Kalvi released a copy of the letter (dated January 20 2018), which reads, “This film showcases the honour and valour of the Rajput community and Rani Padmavati is portrayed with utmost dignity and respect. What you have been protesting about (alleged dream sequence or alleged romantic relation between Rani Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji) is not there in the film and was never there as given to you in writing on 29.01.2017 in Jaipur.” It is signed by Associate Producer Chetan Deolekar.
 
 Kalvi claimed that Sanjay Leela Bhansali is making last-ditch attempts for smooth release of film. “I received this letter on Saturday morning. While they are inviting us to watch the movie, there is no mention about when this movie would be shown to us. This letter is nothing but a gimmick by Bhansali Productions,” he said, while addressing the media in Jaipur.
 
 Harping on Karni Sena’s demand of a complete ban on the controversial movie, Kalvi said that time has come for people to choose which side they want to stand on. “People should decide if they want to support Padmavati or Khilji - it is a choice between Ram and Ravan,” he said.
 
 He said he is confident that movie will not be released in the state. “We have asked for a Janta curfew, I am sure that even people will not be interested in watching this movie,” he said. Kalvi said that film distributors now have to decide what should be done. “I am sure that no film distributor will screen the movie, nobody is that idiotic,” he said.
 
 Sena president Mahipal Singh Makrana claimed that people will support Karni Sena and boycott the movie. “I have full faith that people will not attend the screening of the movie,” he said.
