MUMBAI: The police are looking for suspended constable   who was last year arrested for outraging the modesty of a widow after the woman again accused him of harassment and torture. The woman (30) has said that if the police do not take any action, she will commit suicide. 

 On Friday, the woman's father approached the   police to lodge a complaint. But, he said, the police did not entertain his complaint and he had to approached DCP N Ambika."Teams have been sent to nab   bur he is not traceable. He has been under suspension as there are three offences against him," said the DCP. The complainant said the cop, who lives in the same building as her, sits near her shop, passes derogatory remarks and stalks her.
