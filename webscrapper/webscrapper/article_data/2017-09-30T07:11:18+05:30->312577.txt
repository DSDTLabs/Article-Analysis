NEW DELHI: The government on Saturday extended the deadline for sale of pre-GST goods with stickers of revised rates by three months to December 31, consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.

 The decision came after several companies and retailers body   highlighted that they are still left with huge unsold stocks of pre-GST goods and need more time to clear that. After implementing   from July 1, the government had allowed use of stickers with revised rates, alongside the printed   for pre-packaged items to reflect changes in MRP for three months till September 30.
 
 “On packaged commodities, industries can display revised MRP due to GST implementation using sticker/ stamping/ online printing up to Dec 31 2017,” Paswan tweeted.
 
 The unsold items had an MRP which included all taxes of pre-GST era but with the implementation of new regime, some of the final retail prices have undergone change due to increase or decrease in tax incidence.
