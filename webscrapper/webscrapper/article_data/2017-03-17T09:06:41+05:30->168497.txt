BENGALURU: After BJP MP   alleged that   in the state were seeking central posting owing to the mishandling of honest officials, a woman officer of the rank asked him not to politicize functioning of the bureaucracy. 

 In a veiled attack on the Congress government, Simha, on social media platforms such as  , said that upright IPS officers such as Madhukar Shetty, Sonia Narang, Labu Ram and   were moving to the Centre because they had failed to get due recognition in the state. However, the state government did not respond to these charges. 
 
  D Roopa, DIG, state prisons, said that politicization of the bureaucracy did not bode well for the system and society. "I earnestly request you to allow the bureaucracy to function freely from political endorsements. I know the officers mentioned in your posts on social media personally. I can vouch for the fact that none of them raised hue and cry about political harassment whatsoever," she said. 
 
 Rebutting Simha's argument, she added, "Sir, you have said that Shetty left the state because he was not given any good posting, which appears to be your imagination. Shetty was not given a good post (by your measure) even during the BJP government's tenure. The fact is that there is no good or bad post. It's the officers who make a post good or bad. The most shining example one can think is that of Kiran Bedi, who did great work in the so-called nondescript place, Tihar Jail."
 
 Pointing out that officers sought central posting for the experience they could gain, Roopa said, "In the case of the officers you have mentioned, it's their personal choice to serve outside the state."
 
 She said that bureaucrats did not require politicians championing their cause." What we ask for is a free hand in our job, and respect," Roopa said.
