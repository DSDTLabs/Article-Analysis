KOLKATA: An   at   was fatally attacked with a blunt weapon at her boyfriend’s house in   on Wednesday. She had gone there to ask him to return her   which she had kept in his custody. 

 Nili Bera (23), who studied history at RBU, died at SSKM Hospital on Thursday.
 
 The police are looking for the boyfriend, Biswajit Sardar.
 
 Nili and Biswajit were both residents of Basirhat’s Chhoto Zirakpur and the two families were aware of their relationship. 
 
 A source said Nili’s elder brother, Abhijit, had recently bagged a job for which he needed money. To help Abhijit out, Nili on Wednesday visited Biswajit’s house to get back some of the money she had kept with him. Nobody else was present at Biswajit’s home at that time. When Biswajit’s mother, Sandhya, returned home in the evening, she found Nili lying unconscious, covered in blood. Nobody else was there. As she raised an alarm, Nili’s family and other neighbours rushed to the spot.
 
 Nili’s mother, also called Sandhya, said her daughter used to keep their family savings in Biswajit’s custody. “We used to depend on him a lot and had also agreed to their marriage. My husband and I are daily wage earners. We used to give a major portion of our earnings to our daughter. She kept that money and some ornaments with her would-be husband. We did not oppose to the practice as we never imagined that something like this might happen ever,” she said. Biswajit has been unemployed for more than three years. 
 
 “A murder case has been registered based on a complaint lodged by the victim’s family. We are waiting for the autopsy report to ascertain the exact cause of her death. We are conducting raids to nab Biswajit and his family members are being questioned,” said Bhaskar Mukherjee, superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas.
