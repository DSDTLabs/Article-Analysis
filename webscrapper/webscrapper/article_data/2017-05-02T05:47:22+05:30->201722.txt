BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh   Regulatory Authority (MP  ) that came into existence from Monday, formally launched its official website. Now, consumers can lodge complaint on the website  .

 Besides, the builders and real estate agents must register themselves on the website.
 
 Chairman of the authority Anthony De Sa told TOI, “MP has become the first state to have constituted the authority and framed its rules.” 
 
 Status about the disposal of consumers’ grievances will be informed on their mobile phone through an SMS gateway, a government spokesman said.
 
 All the future real estate projects, those which remained incomplete by April 30 or the projects whose completion certificate has not yet been issued by municipal corporations will come within the ambit of the authority.
 
 It has been made mandatory for the promoters and builders to get them registered with the authority before starting marketing of any project, the spokesman said, adding, that all the projects underway must get themselves registered within three months. 
 
 Apart from this the promoters and developers of the real estate projects will also have to update the status of the project on the website every three months. This would be displayed with photographs on the website, spokesman said.
 
 The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 has been enacted by the Parliament which seeks to protect home-buyers as well as help boost investments in the real estate sector. The bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha on March 10, 2016 and by the Lok Sabha on March 15. The Act came into force from 1 May 2016. 
 
 On the first day, there were 116 hits on the website. However, neither any real estate promoter registered itself on the website nor did any consumer register complaint.
 
 The government development agencies like the   development authority and the MP housing board will also come within the sphere of RERA.
