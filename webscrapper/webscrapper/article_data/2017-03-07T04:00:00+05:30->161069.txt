Mumbai:   chairman   has clarified that minimum balance requirement reintroduced by the bank from April does not apply to the PM’s   ( ) accounts or to the ‘Basic Savings Bank’ accounts

 “This does not apply to any financial inclusion account. All banks as far as we are aware already have such charges,” said Bhattacharya, pointing out that a false impression was being created by those who have not read applicability of the new norms.
 
 In July 2012, SBI had waived the minimum balance requirement on bank accounts to expand customer base. Since then, it has opened several crore accounts under PMJDY. RBI also requires banks to offer a ‘basic banking account’ without chequebook, where minimum balance requirement won’t apply.
 
 According to bankers, during demonetisation banks were hit by charges from other banks as several customers without adequate balance attempted card transactions. Meanwhile, a news agency report quoted sources stating that the government will ask other banks to reconsider the cash handling charges, which will come into effect from April 1.
 
 Under the revised norms, SBI will permit savings bank account holders to deposit cash three times a month free of charges and levy Rs 50 plus service tax on every transaction beyond that. In case of current account, the levy could go as high as Rs 20,000.
 
 According to the list of revised charges of SBI, failure to maintain   (MAB) in accounts will attract a penalty of up to Rs 100 plus service tax. In metropolitan areas, there will be a charge of Rs 100 plus service tax, if the balance falls below 75% of the MAB of Rs 5,000. If the shortfall is 50% or less of the MAB, then the bank will charge Rs 50 plus service tax.
