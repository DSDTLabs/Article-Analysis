PATNA: Ostensibly taking a leaf from Akshay Kumar-starrer ‘Padman’, the Danapur rail division administration has decided to install sanitary pad vending machines at Patna Junction in collaboration with an NGO. The machine will become functional from February 28.

 According to East Cenral Railway’s chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar, a decision to the effect was taken at a meeting between Danapur DRM Ranjan Prakash Thakur and representatives of an NGO. To begin with, the NGO has been tasked with installing two such machines at Patna Junction.
 
 Sources said one machine each would be installed in the two washrooms for women on platform number 1 of Patna Junction. Each machine will have the capacity to supply 120 pads every day on insertion of a 5-rupees coin/pad.
 
 “Patna Junction will become the third major railway station after Bhopal and Pune to offer sanitary pad vending machine facility to the needy women passengers,” Kumar said and added an incinerator would also be installed to dispose of the used pads and women staff deployed to oversee the functioning of the two machines.
 
 The Danapur rail division administration, sources said, intends to provide this facility also at Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Patna Saheb, Danapur and Patalipura Junction stations soon.
