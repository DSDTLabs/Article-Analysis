Mumbai: In a bid to counter criticism that the BJP did not give tickets to   in the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, where the community comprises around 20% of the state’s population, the party is working on its outreach. 

 Last week, BJP city unit chief Ashish Shelar appointed new office bearers of the party’s minority wing. The BJP hopes the wing’s members will work to “popularize” the party among Muslims. 
 
 The party’s leadership has taken cognizance of fact that Muslim candidates it fielded in the recent BMC   did miserably. All six of the party’s Muslim candidates lost. Despite that, there is a fresh attempt by the party to reach out to the community. 
 
 “Shelarji and other senior leaders of our party sincerely believe that we must reach out to the community, irrespective of whether or not they voted for us. Though not a single BJP Muslim candidate won in the municipal elections, our efforts to engage with the community will continue,” said Waseem Khan, BJP minority morcha’s city president. 
 
 “The morcha will act as a bridge between the community and the government and get the genuine issues of the Muslims addressed. We will try to bring the community closer to the party through confidence-building measures,” added Khan. 
 
 Out of the six Muslims that the BJP fielded in the BMC polls, Shabana Azam, sister-in-law of city BJP vice-president Haider Azam, put up an impressive performance in Malwani, Malad. She secured more than 4,000 votes and lost to Qamar Jahan Siddiqui, Congress legislator Aslam Shaikh’s sister. “The fact that our candidate received so many votes in this area where the Congress has a sitting MLA itself sends out a positive signal. We have not lost hope and will continue to reach out to the community. Many Muslims voted for the candidates fielded from the community by the BJP in the BMC polls,” said Azam.
