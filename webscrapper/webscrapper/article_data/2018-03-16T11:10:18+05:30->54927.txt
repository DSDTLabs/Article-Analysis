KANYAKUMARI:  , 29, from a village near   in Kanyakumari district will be left with only Rs 6 lakh as she has to repay the housing loan of Rs 14 lakh her husband  , 29, obtained last year. The couple got married about five years ago and has two daughters aged four and two.

 Sajeev had a motorised fibre boat on which he had gone fishing with a couple of other men on the dreadful day. On Wednesday, Jeena got the cheque for Rs 10 lakh and a receipt for the Rs 10 lakh fixed deposit as compensation for her husband’s demise. “My husband built our house last year and I have to repay the loan,” she said. She was happy that she would be able to repay the loan before the end of the year when she would get the fixed deposit also transferred to her account. 
 
 “We (she and Sajeev) wanted to give good education to our daughters. I am planning to open a fixed deposit for the remaining Rs 6 lakh and use its interest to educate them,” Jeena said adding that she was well aware that it would not be enough for her to run the family.
