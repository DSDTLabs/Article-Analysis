GURUGRAM: Residents of   claim that   were not cleaning the area adequately and that heaps of waste and leaf litter have been strewn across the sector for last 10 - 15 days. Residents said the Eco Green vans refused to remove waste that wasn’t dumped in bins.

 “This issue is becoming graver by the day,” said Dinesh Aggarwal, resident and former RWA president of Sector 14. “It seems that nobody cares about this place now. Everywhere we go; there is heaps of trash.   sweepers do a superficial job. When we ask them to remove the trash, they promise to do it but then nothing is done”. “The eco green vans come and only take the waste that is bagged in giant sacks or dustbins. The trash that it littered around, they do not even touch it,”   said. 
 
 MCG has been unresponsive to their calls. “Our biggest problem has been that officials barely take our calls now. There are so many issues that we are supposed to apprise them about,” said Gaurav, another resident. When TOI contacted MCG officials, they assured that the matter would be resloved.
