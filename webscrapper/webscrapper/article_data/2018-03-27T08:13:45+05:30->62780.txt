CHENNAI: Air fares have shot up due to high demand for tickets during the Easter weekend (March 30 to April 1) that starts on Thursday. Going by ticket prices, Port Blair is the most popular destination followed by Delhi and Mumbai. Flights are expensive to Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram because the routes see demand from tourists and people who return home. 

 Fares to Port Blair, Delhi, Mumbai, Kochi and Kolkata are high because they are either tourist destinations or gateways to other places. Air fares are high for flights on Thursday and Friday when majority of the people travel.
 
 
  
 
 The one-way fare ranges from Rs14,000 to Rs24,000 to Port Blair, Rs,6,000 to 22,000 to Kolkata, Rs 6,800 to 7,400 to Thiruvananthapuram. A travel portal lists Mumbai, Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram as sector with high demand based on the bookings received.
 
 The trend shows that Port Blair and Kolkata cannot be part of a travel itinerary unless getaways are planned much in advance. One-way fare to Port Blair had touched the maximum of Rs12,000 for two month's advance booking for Easter weekend.
 
 "With the summer heat setting in, a lot of people visit the hilly regions of India. Domestic and inbound travellers are heading to Munnar, Wayanad and Ooty in the south; Udaipur, Mount Abu, Chandigarh and Manali in the north and Shillong, Guwahati, Gangtok and Darjeeling in the east that have pleasant weather," said FCM Travel Solutions managing director Rakshit Desai. 
 
 However, after the initial glitch of high air fares, regional connectivity seems to be picking up as fare on the Chennai-Salem route is at Rs 3,000 for travel on Thursday and Rs 1,900 to Rs 2,500 in the first week of April. On the   route, the fares are in the range of Rs 1,200 to Rs 3,000 for peak travel season in April and May.
