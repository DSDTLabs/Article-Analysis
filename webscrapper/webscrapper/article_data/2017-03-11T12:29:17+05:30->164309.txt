Congress maintains a minuscule lead over BJP in Manipur as the counting of votes for 60 seats is underway across 11 venues. Of the 39 constituencies for which trends are available right now, the Congress is leading in 17, and the BJP in 14, while the Left is leading in four. 

 The ruling Congress is facing a big test in the state amid the economic blockade imposed by the United Naga Council, which has also been part of the key issues for the state election. BJP has criticised the Congress party for its alleged failure to solve the over three-month-long economic blockade paralysing the two national highways of the land-locked state.
 
 However, in the recently concluded counting for the Thoubal constituency, the chief minister has emerged a winner, scoring over both contenders - BJP's Leitanthem Basanta Singh and PRJA's  .
 
 Thirty companies of central forces have been deployed to guard the counting centres. The Election Commission officials are monitoring the counting online with CCTV facilities.
 
 Elections in the state were held in two phases on March 4 and 8. Both phases witnessed record voting of 84 and 89 per cent respectively.
