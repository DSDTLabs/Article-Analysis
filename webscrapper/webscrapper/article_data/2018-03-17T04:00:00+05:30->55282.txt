Mumbai: The country’s   (CAD) widened to $13.5 billion, or 2% of the gross domestic product (GDP), in the third quarter of fiscal 2017-18 as compared to $8 billion, or 1.4% of GDP, in the year-ago period. While the numbers are better than expected, there are concerns that the deficit could widen to beyond 2.5% of   in FY19 on the back of higher oil prices and the threat of US restrictions on   from India.

  chief economist (India) Sonal Varma said, “The deterioration reflected a much wider trade deficit as higher commodity prices and a domestic recovery resulted in imports outpacing exports. However, the deterioration in the current account was less than expected as the invisibles surplus surprised positively, rising a strong 21% year-on-year in Q4 versus 15.4% in Q3, led by higher services exports and increased private remittances, both reflecting the impact of the synchronised global recovery.”
 
 The trade deficit in the current quarter is likely to be hit by some adverse factors. 
 
 Emkay Global research head Dhananjay Sinha said, “Exports as well as import growth were highly skewed by petroleum products. GST-related glitches and the recent   bank fraud have dented the overall gems & jewellery exports and the same is likely to remain subdued. The imposition of trade restrictions globally is likely to increase risk to the overall trade activity.”
 
 Nomura’s Varma added, “In 2017, the overall current account deficit widened to 1.5% of GDP from a deficit of 0.6% in 2016 and we expect a further deterioration to 2% of GDP in 2018, reflecting higher oil prices and a strong cyclical recovery. Although funding should not be an issue, the basic balance of payments will be negative, making funding susceptible to global risk sentiment.”
