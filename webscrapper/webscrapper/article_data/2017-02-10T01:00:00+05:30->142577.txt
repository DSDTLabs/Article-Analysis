 Rock: The 32nd studio album by British singer-songwriter Elton John starts so upbeat and easy that it sets the tone and finds its groove within the first 10 seconds after you hit play. At the peak of his song-writing skills, this album is basically John having a real good time. His range in the album is quite amazing, with him crooning the Blues in ' ' to Country in the song 'I’ve Got 2 Wings', you find yourself looking forward to each track just to see how the artiste flirts with each genre. Long  , John’s song-writing partner, keeps the album deep and meaningful, yet irreverent and funky at the same time. So, sit back and get ready for a wonderful, crazy time with these ten beautiful tracks. The extended Super deluxe edition however, has a total of four extra tracks including 'Free and Easy', 'Children's Song', 'No Monsters' and 'England and America'.
