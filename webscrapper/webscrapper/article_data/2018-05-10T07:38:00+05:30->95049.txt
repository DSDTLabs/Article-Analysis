Ludhiana: Allegations have been levelled against Ward 26 Akali councillor Surjit Rai for manhandling a sewerman in Jamalpur, Mundian. Sewermen alleged that the area councillor manhandled their co-worker Kanhayia, and also abused him while he was doing his duty on Tuesday. They also made a complaint with police officials, and staged a protest against the councillor on Wednesday in the area, besides burning his effigy. However, the councillor refuted the allegations.

 A sewerman, Sanjay, said that on Tuesday, four people were cleaning the sewerage when area councillor Surjit came there and started abusing them. He also alleged that he slapped Kanhayia after abusing them. He further said they brought the matter to the knowledge of their officials, who advised them to lodge a complaint with the police. Sanjay said they had given a complaint at the police station on Tuesday, but when no action was taken by the police, they protested on Wednesday. On the other hand, Rai said he neither abused nor hit anybody, but only asked them to work properly.
 
 On Wednesday, the sewermen also met the zonal commissioner and demanded that the matter should reach the mayor for taking action against the councillor. SHO of Jamalpur police station, Avtar Singh, said they had received a complaint against the Akali councillor, and action would be taken after verifying all the facts.
