 Moved by the film, Sargun, who has starred in hit TV serials like Balika Vadhu and several reality shows such as Bigg Boss and Nach Baliye, wrote on her Instagram account:
 
  I watched #BAHUBALI yesterday and realised what it means to give your imagination wings. It’s a masterpiece. Thank you #ssrajamouli and @dharmamovies for giving our cinema a film like this. I know some of you think that it is over the top but if you want to know my opinion then here it is. I personally think reality is overrated since its perspective and its different for everybody. This film transports you to another world, a world like yours but not yours truly; flow with it. It’s not over the top its dramatic, and cinematically aesthetically dramatic. A superlative job done by the entire team. so like i said enjoy ss.rajamouli's brilliant imagination. we have now our own version of fictional characters as superheroes. Ps: remember Birds born in a cage think flying is an illness. #Bahubali #ssrajamouli #prabhas #anuskashetty #cinema #love #MUSTWATCH
