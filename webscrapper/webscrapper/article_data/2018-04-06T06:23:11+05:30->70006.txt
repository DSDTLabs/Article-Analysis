LUCKNOW: Power employees called off their agitation against UP government's attempt to privatize power distribution companies on Thursday after   took back its tender document inviting bids under integrated service provider scheme. 

 The corporation assured the employees that it would not implement the scheme without taking them into confidence. The   also entered into an agreement with the employees that it would take suggestions from them to improve the power sector and taking feed back from other states.
 
 The development comes almost 20 days after the power employee boycotted work in protest against the state government’s move to hand over power distribution system of five cities, including Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Meerut and Moradabad. In fact, the state cabinet, too, had given its nod to the privatization proposal. “The decision to privatize power distribution was arbitrary and therefore needed to be taken back. Engineers have been giving their best to improve power situation and curtail revenue losses,'' said Shailndra Dubey, convener of UP Vidyut Karamchari Sangharsh Samiti. UPPCL sources said the administration too wanted to assuage the agitating employee.
