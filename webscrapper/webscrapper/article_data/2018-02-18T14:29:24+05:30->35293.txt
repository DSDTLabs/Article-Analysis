TUTICORIN: Accusing the Centre of extending undue benefits to corporate business houses, Communist Party of India (Marxist) politburo member   said the Prime Minister owed an explanation to the nation on the Rs 11,000 crore Punjab National Bank fraud case and the Rafale fighter jet deal with France.

 Pointing out that billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi, who is wanted in connection with the   scam, managed to pose for a picture with the Prime Minister at Davos where they participated in the World Economic Forum,   said, “BJP cadres, who were chanting ‘Modi, Modi’ during election rallies, have stopped the sloganeering as they realised it would remind the public of Nirav Modi.” 
 
 Speaking to reporters after inaugurating the party’s 22nd state level conference here on Saturday, he said the government’s refusal to provide details on the Rafale deal led to suspicion that it has something to hide.
 
 Karat also said the BJP had entrusted the supply and maintenance of advanced components for the Rafale fighters to a company run by  , which has no track record in defence or arms production, instead of picking the experienced public sector undertaking  .
 
 Karat expressed confidence that the CPI (M) that is in power in Tripura from 1993 will form the government with a strong majority after the assembly election on Sunday. This, he said, would be in spite of the BJP pumping hundreds of crores of rupees into Tripura and aligning with outfits working against the interests of the northeastern state where tribals and non-tribals live in harmony.
 
 At the party meeting, Karat said the Left and other parties and movements believing in democracy should join hands at the national level to forge a strong alliance accommodating everyone opposing the RSS and BJP, which are creating unrest among people of different faiths.
 
 He charged that the Centre was imposing authoritarianism in the country with pro-corporate economic policies sacrificing the common man’s welfare and claimed that the BJP was planting its ideologues in top posts in institutions of higher education and cultural organisations.
 
 The four-day meet will conclude on Tuesday with a public meeting in which party general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and senior leaders will address the gathering.
