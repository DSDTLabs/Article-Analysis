CHANDIGARH: A day after the encounter of Surender Geong, a dreaded criminal, his father on Sunday alleged that his son has been murdered by Haryana police and AICC spokesman   was had also conspired with cops. In the absence of forensic experts in the Kalpana Chawla Hospital, the Judicial magistrate on Sunday has deferred the autopsy of Geong’s body. Forensic Postmortem of the body will be held on Monday, said police.

 Geong’s father   and one family friend K K Jaildar of Geong village said that Surjewala had strong reasons to conspire with police as he was the one who had approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court as well as   while alleging threat from Surender Geong. ''Police will never give the clear picture about as to what had happened. Some of the eye witnesses have said that Surender was shot from point blank as well as from within 10 feet. Let the case by handed over to Central Bureau of Investigation(CBI) the truth will come to the fore,’’ said Ishwar Singh.
 
 Ishwar Singh said that it was during late evening hours when police had informed the family about the incident through Sarpanch. `` They would have named Surender as an accused even if a dog would have been killed in the city,’’ said Ishwar Singh when asked about Surender Geong’s involvement in heinous crimes and his association with slain gangster Sandeep Gadauli of Gurgram.
 Though, Surjewala remained inaccessible. Sources close to him also refused to respond to the allegations by saying, ''It was between police and them.’
 ’
 Meanwhile, when contacted the Karnal SP Jashandeep Singh Randhawa also outrightly dismissed the allegations. ``The matter is under investigation. Let the law run its course to put an end to all the allegations, speculations or rumors and bring out the actual facts,’’ said SP. On Saturday afternoon, Geong was shot dead in an encounter by the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Staff of Karnal and Kaithal police in Rahra village of Assandh Sub division of Karnal.
