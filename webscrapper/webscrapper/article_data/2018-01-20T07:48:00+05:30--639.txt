LUDHIANA: The green plastic campaign of the income tax   got a big boost on Friday when the total tally of schools interested to join its initiative and make vertical gardens in their schools crossed 300. The development comes two days after 150 school principals visited the I-T office at   and expressed their interest to be a part of this campaign.

 According to Binay K Jha, chief commissioner of income tax, Ludhiana: “We are getting a huge response to the green plastic initiative. Along with government schools, a large number of private schools too have come forward to be a part of this campaign, and are visiting our office to express their willingness to make vertical gardens in their schools. Department officials say a lot of queries were also being received from industrialists for making similar gardens in their factories, while a few corporates — including Avon Cycles, Vardhman Textiles, Rockman Cycle Industries, Nahar Group, Hero Cycles, Octave Apparels, King Export, and   — too have expressed their desire for vertical gardens in their units.”
 
 On Friday, deputy commissioner   too visited the I-T department and saw the vertical garden, visibly impressed by the effort put in by officials. Speaking to TOI, he said: “This is an impressive and excellent concept, and hats off to I-T officials for their achievement. Along with beautifying the building and getting rid of waste plastic material, this   is also spreading greenery. The best part is that one can grow this garden on concrete itself, and that too very easily. Representatives of Avon and Vardhman again visited the department to see the vertical garden and take in details of the project.
