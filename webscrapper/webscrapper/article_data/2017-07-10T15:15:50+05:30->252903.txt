NEW DELHI: Did   vice president   meet with Chinese envoy Luo Zhaohui on Saturday or did he not? 

 The Congress denied it on Monday. And the Chinese embassy in Delhi first posted then removed a statement on its website saying that the two met, reported Times Now. 
 
 The Congress denied as "fake news" media reports that its vice president met Luo in the Capital amid the China-India border stand-off at   in Sikkim.
 
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, in a series of tweets said some news channels were running "fake news" on Rahul's alleged meeting with the Chinese Ambassador.
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 He alleged that the report was planted by external affairs ministry and intelligence bureau sources.
 
  
  
 On Friday, Rahul had tweeted asking why Prime Minister   is "silent" on China. The Congress renewed its attack on the issue on Monday.
 
  
  
 Congress social media head Ramya wondered why PM Modi did not flag the border issue with Chinese President   when the two leaders met last week at the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany.
 
  
  
 In fact, she said even if Rahul did meet the Chinese envoy, "I don't see it as an issue."
