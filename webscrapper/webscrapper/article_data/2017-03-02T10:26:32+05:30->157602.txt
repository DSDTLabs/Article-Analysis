HYDERABAD: A small municipal park in Sundar Nagar colony near   in the city is now the icon of ‘game-changing transformation’ for the  , London. The Sundar Nagar Park, once a dumping ground of garbage and building debris, has turned into a place of recreation for residents and pedestrians alike. The remarkable change has been possible thanks to the efforts of a group of students, who used their creative and entrepreneurial skills, to revamp the unused public space.

 Another group of students, about 650 km away in  , inspired children in government schools to transform their surroundings through effective design interventions, instilling values of cleaner, greener and creative public spaces.
 
 Hyderabad’s Project Heaven and Visakhapatnam’s Ripple Effect are part of an international design competition that inspired students to transform 100 disused spaces across 40 South Asian cities in 150 days. The design challenge was set up by the University of Westminster. About 1500 local undergraduate architecture students including a dozen from Hyderabad (Sri Venkateswara College of Architecture) and Visakhapatnam ( ) made this vision a reality.
 
 Anmisha Reddy, a second year student of Sri Venkateswara College of Architecture, said she and her classmates were excited about the competition. “The park was an abandoned parcel of land, just accumulating trash. We got the necessary permissions and set about cleaning the site. We built low cost benches. The walls were painted, and the place was given a fresh look ,” she told TOI. Komma Kavya, Raj Bharath and Nikitha Reddy were also part of the project. The students brought back into active use through ‘design and build’ solutions using recycled materials. Zsuzsanna Matyak of the University of Westminster, said.
 
 The International Design Challenge, part of the wider Latitudes Network at the University of Westminster is inspired by the   and the wave of citizen participation it has generated through its cleanliness drives.
