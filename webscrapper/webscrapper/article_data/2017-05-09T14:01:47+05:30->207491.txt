 is certainly the buzz word of the moment. And Kannada actor   recently shared with us a picture of his Prema Baraha team on the sets of Baahubali: The Conclusion. Chandan, along with co-star   and her director-actor father   went and visited SS Rajamouli, Prabhas and Anushka Shetty. 
Chandan was visibly excited that he could get to meet the team of arguably the biggest Indian film till date and said that he enjoyed chatting up the actors and technicians who were working on the magnum opus.
