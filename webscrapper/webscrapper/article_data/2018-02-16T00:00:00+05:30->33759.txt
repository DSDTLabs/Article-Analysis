The team of Nivin Pauly’s   film Kayamkulam Kochunni has been shooting in   and its vicinity. The set of the   has been witness to many star guests, including Suriya, Jyothika and Rakshit Shetty. But earlier this week, the city went into a tizzy when Malayalam superstar   came visiting the city. “Lalettan was gracious enough to play a cameo in our film and he will be essaying a major role in our film,” says Nivin who will be portraying Kochunni, a real-life Robin Hood-like figure who existed in early 19th century and hailed from Kayamkulam. Word is that Mohanlal has allotted over 15 days for the shoot which also involves songs and major fight sequences. Mohanlal, we hear, will be playing the role of Ithikkara Pakki, who became a legend as the first Robin Hood of Kerala, thus making Kochunni and him contemporaries. This is the fourth venture of Mohanlal and Rosshan Andrrews and more importantly the first time Nivin and the star, who will be seen together on screen. Mohanlal is scheduled to be part of the shoot to be held in Mangaluru, Goa and Sri Lanka.
