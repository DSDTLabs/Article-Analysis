April is commemorated the world over as   Awareness Month and 2nd April was World Autism Awareness Day. To support autism awareness the city saw two runs for autism today. One was   which organised a   at Chikoowadi, Borivali and there was Autism Cause-a-thon at Bandra. Both the events saw huge participation from   and their parents too. After the run concluded the crowd was one happy bunch receiving medals. At the Borivali event some of kids even showcased their talents in singing, dancing and keyboard. 
 
  
 The aim was to create awareness about Autism and those affected due to it. According to the latest statistics, one in 68 people have autism which means that 2.72 lakhs persons in Mumbai have autism. Although children with autism have access to more schools and facilities than before, it is a sad state of affairs for adults with autism. 
  
  
 Most setups for special adults take only a couple of persons with autism. Owing to this, most adults with autism spend time at home and their parents are clueless as to how to address their needs and help them become an integral and productive part of society.
