Buoyed by this look,   art lovers are also trying out new designs. So instead of a neat and solid   line, you can stick a mix of glitters and sequins all over your nail and glitter bed. For this look, you will need something like an eyelash adhesive to make sure that the glitter flakes stay on the skin.
 If you are averse to putting nail paint outside of your nail bed, you can use liquid glitter eyeliner instead.
 A note of caution. Glitters are difficult to remove and also tend to dry the nails, so don’t forget to give your nails a   oil massage after a day of glitters. 
 “This   is an unconventional way to beautify more than just nails. Not only does it help in making a   statement, but is also a smart cover for bad polish application. The application can be done by applying a thin line outside of the nail area alongside the cutcile,” said nail expert Neela Bopaiah.
