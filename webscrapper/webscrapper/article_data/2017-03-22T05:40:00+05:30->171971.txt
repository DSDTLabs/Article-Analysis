Nagpur: A major fire raged for more than 12 hours at the Bhandewadi dumping yard on Tuesday, alarming firefighters who struggled to control the blaze.

 As many as four fire tenders from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s fire and emergency services department were pressed into service. They completed at least 10 trips each to combat the fire.
 
 Officials said the fire started around 9.45am. Though the fire department had stationed one of its fire tenders there, it failed to control the blaze. Soon, it engulfed and took a devastating turn. Firefighters found it difficult to navigate to the source of the fire amid piles of garbage in the dumping yard spread over hundreds of acres.
 
 The health department also pressed three excavators to assist fire brigade personnel to control the blaze.
 
 “There is severe smoke and all of us are suffering with burning sensations in our throat,” said residents of Wardhaman Nagar.
