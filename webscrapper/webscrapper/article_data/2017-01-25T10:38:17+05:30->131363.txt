KORAPUT: The death toll in the   derailment touched 41 after a body was spotted at the mishap site on Tuesday. Rayagada sub-collector Muralidhar Swain said the deceased has been identified as S  , who was a typist at the court of the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC), Bissamkatak, in Rayagada district. 

 The   had derailed near Kuneru station, around 25 km from Rayagada, in Andhra Pradesh on Saturday night. 
 
  Investigation Agency (NIA), probing the train accident, continued with their investigation for the second successive day. The five-member team visited Rayagada hospital and interacted with some of the injured people during their half-an-hour stay before leaving for the accident spot. "We are examining the incident from several angles. Nothing can be divulged at the moment," one of the team members said on Tuesday.
 
 Earlier, on Monday, the team had spent over seven hours at the accident spot and had inspected the broken track and the mangled compartments apart from interrogating several railway staff of Kuneru station, including the station manager. 
 
 As the accident area comes in a Maoist-hit zone and a goods train had passed on the same track just two hours before the mishap, the railways had been suspecting foul play.
