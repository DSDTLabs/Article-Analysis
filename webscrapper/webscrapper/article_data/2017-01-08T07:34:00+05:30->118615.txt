CHANDIGARH: A tavern owner brutally ran over a 28-year-old man following an altercation over a sarcastic remark from the victim at Khidwali village of Rohtak. The victim, identified as Sonu, died on Saturday afternoon.

 The incident occurred on Friday night when Sonu was standing at the village bus stop with his friends. As accused Jagbir Singh, who owns a tavern in Rohtak, reached there, Sonu addressed him as ‘chor’ (thief). This led to the altercation between the two. Jagbir initially left the place but came back after 10 minutes.
 
 “Sonu was still there and the accused first knocked him down with his car. Before the victim could react or rush for safety, Jagbir reversed his car and crushed him. He then drove away leaving unconscious Sonu on the spot. Sonu’s family rushed him to PGIMS, Rohtak, where he died on Saturday afternoon,” said inspector  , station house officer (SHO) of Rohtak Sadar.
 
 He said police had handed over the victim’s body after postmortem examination to his family. “We have registered the case and will speak to the victim’s family after it comes to terms with the incident. Meanwhile, we have constituted teams to chase down Jagbir,” said inspector Vijay.
 
 It is the second such incident in Haryana where a person has been killed after being mowed down by a vehicle.
 
 On December 21, 2016, a group of youths belonging to upper castes trampled a 55-year-old Dalit woman when she tried to broker peace between two groups to avert clash in   village under Badra sub-division of Bhiwani.
 
 Identified as Dano Devi, her head and upper stomach were crushed and she died on the spot. There has been heavy deployment of police to avert caste clashes in the village. Police have started investigations after registering a case of murder under the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act at Badra police station.
