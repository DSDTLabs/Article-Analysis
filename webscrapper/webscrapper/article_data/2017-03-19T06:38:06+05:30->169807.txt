MUMBAI: In a possible reflection of the impact of  , the estimates of the revenue received by the state dropped by nearly Rs 800 crores during 2016-17, the figures in the state budget show. The note-ban was introduced in November 2016. The budgeted estimate for   in 2016-17 was 2,20,810 crore. However the revised estimate is Rs 2,20,011crore.

 The figures show that the estimates for the state's own tax revenue dropped during this period by Rs 6,991 crore during this period. The estimate dropped from 1.44 lakh crore to 1.37 lakh crore.
 
 The revenue expected from stamp duty and registration fees fell by 15%, indicating a slump of trade in the realty market. The gap between the initial and revised estimate for this revenue stream for 2016-17 was Rs 3,547 crore. The budgeted estimate was Rs 23,547 crore and the revised estimate is Rs 20,000 crore.
 
 State excise duties ­ another major revenue generator -also fell 11% short of expectations. The decline between the budgeted and revised estimates for state excise duty for 2016 is Rs 1,743 crore. The budgeted estimate was 15,343 crore and the revised estimate was Rs 13,600 crore.
 
 Land revenue also fell short by half from the sum initially budgeted. The budgeted estimate was Rs 3,200 crore but the revised estimate was Rs 1,500 crore ­ a fall of Rs 1700 crore. Estimates of revenue receipts from non-tax revenue also dipped from Rs 19,997 crore to 16,619 crore. This is a dip of 16.8%.
 
 However, the shortfall in revenue estimated from all these streams was compensated by a rise in the state's share in central taxes and grants in aid from the Central government.
 
 The revenue estimate of grants in aid from the Central government rose by almost 30%. The budgeted revenue from grants in aid from the Centre was Rs 24,964 crore and the revised estimate was 32,447 crore.
 
 Estimates of the state's share in Central taxes rose from a budgeted estimate of 31,627 crore to a revised estimate of 33,714 crore. A rise of 6.5%.
 
 “The gap in the revised revenue estimates in stamp duty registration, state excise and land revenue indicate a slowdown in realty and industrial production,“ said Ajit Ranade, chief economist of the Aditya Birla group.“But the shortfall has been compensated by a rise in the state's share in Central taxes and grants-in-aid.“
