ITANAGAR: Chief minister   has warned government officials to perform or to face stern action, even terminations of their jobs. Addressing a coordination meeting of government officials and   at Tawang on Saturday, the chief minister observed that benefits of several welfare schemes were not percolating to the ground level due to bureaucratic hurdles. 

 He asked the government officials to do their work sincerely as their performance directly reflects on the conduct of the elected officials, an official report informed.
 
 Khandu said the government employees have been given whatever they have demanded - from implementing the   awards to enhancing the retirement age to 60 - since he became CM.
 
 The state government has also agreed on several benefits for government employees, including doling out the highest salaries in the northeast. The output of government employees should thus be commensurate with the benefits they receive, said the CM.
 
 "I work for 15-20 hours a day and expect our government employees to work at least 8-9 hours for the welfare of the people," the CM said, while discussing several issues such as land compensation, drinking water, health and sanitation.
 
 He asked heads of each department not to leave the district without prior permission or face consequences. He also asked the DC to issue suspension/termination orders if any government employee remains absent despite several showcause notices.
 
 The meeting was attended by Tawang MLA Tsering Tashi, ZPC Chairperson  , panchayat leaders, head of the departments and officials from various departments.
