PURULIA: In a bid to stop the opposition from making inroads into the development-starved Jangalmahal, chief minister   wants her administration to focus on allround development of this tribal-dominated region. She made it quite evident on Wednesday, when she stormed out of an administrative meeting in Purulia, peeved at the district administration's “failure“ to implement the development projects.

 And at a public meeting in Purulia on Thursday, the CM's development pledges were greeted by thunderous applause from the thousands who had gathered there to listen to her. The announcements included a Rs 1200-crore piped water project with   (JICA), focus on electrification, formation of the Mahato Kurmi development board, jobs for locals, help for poultry farmers and a granite hub at  .“The Centre may have stopped its grant (for backward regions), but the state has chalked out a Rs 110-crore Jangalmahal Integrated Development Plan,“ she said.
 
 Observers, however, found a political reason behind the re newed focus on development of the tribal-dominated region and the formation of the   Mahato Kurmi Development Board -along the lines of the development boards formed for tribals in north Bengal. The   chief might have taken a leaf out of BJP's Uttar Pradesh book, they say. The saffron party's landslide victory there is largely credited to its ability to reach out to the tribals.
 
 The chief minister also announced her governemnt will give priority to locals while ap pointing people for a local project. “Locals are best suited for local jobs,“ she said. “I had met a delegation of Mahato and Kurmi leaders. They wanted inclusion (of certain sub-sects) in the Centre's OBC list. We want it. The Centre doesn't.Still we will move a cabinet proposal and send it to the Centre,“ she said.
 
 Banerjee also urged people to set up poultry farms. She said every individual applying for permission to set up a poultry farm would be given 10 chicks or ducklings free of cost.
