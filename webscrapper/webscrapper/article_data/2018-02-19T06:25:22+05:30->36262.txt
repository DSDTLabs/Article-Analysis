HYDERABAD: To check the commuting woes of citizens, TOI went around the city. Several vehicles were seen not following the basic   rules including safety precautions. 

 Even if the road is single lane, vehicles at a slow pace do not move towards the left. Many cars, including buses at a slow pace were in the middle of the road.
 
 After an accident at   in   today where a   rammed into a pole, commuters said if lane driving was enforced the accident could have been avoided. "If the vehicles moving at a slow pace were on the left side of the road allowing other vehicles to overtake this commuter wouldn't have rammed her car into the pole," said a commuter at the accident spot. 
 
 Some disciplined commuters believe that stringent rules while issuing licence can have a great impact on traffic menace.
 
 "Like in western countries, licences should be issued only if a driver is aware of all norms and has perfect driving skills. Strict vigilance at RTO office should be ensured," said  , a motorist.
