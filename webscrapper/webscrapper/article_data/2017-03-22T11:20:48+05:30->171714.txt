BHOPAL: A passenger on the Bhind-Indore Intercity Express tweeted railway minister   that he was being “harassed” by the TTE and   on Sunday night. Prabhu took quick action, but the result wasn’t what the passenger expected. “Turned out, he was drunk. He was arrested and is now in jail,” said an official. 

 The railways’ twitter account looks into the queries and concerns of passengers and has often been in the news for delivering milk for babies or reaching medical aid in response to tweets. on Sunday, Dewas resident Prayas Taravi tweeted that a ticket examiner and an RPF officer were misbehaving with him when he asked for a fresh bedroll. He mentioned he was in berth 39 of B1 coach.
 
 His tweet was promptly forwarded to Ravi Upadhyay, the RPF commandant at Bhopal and other officers. A team was sent to check but were surprised to find that Taravi was “drunk” and creating a ruckus, say officials. 
 
 According to sources, the fracas started when the TTE asked him to show the ticket and Taravi allegedly launched into a heated argument, asking him to fetch a fresh bedroll. As the TTE tried to explain that it was the job of a coach attendant to provide him with the bedroll, the passenger insisted that he will not show his tickets until his demands were met, said sources.
 
 The TTE had to call RPF to intervene. By then, Taravi had tweeted an SOS to the railway minister. “When the matter was examined it was found that the passenger was drunk and had sent the tweet in an inebriated condition. His complaint was false. In fact, he was creating nuisance inside the coach,” said an RPF officer. Taravi was arrested and produced in court, which remanded him in judicial, say sources.
