SURAT: It is our tradition to felicitate someone when he or she achieves something in life. However, it is a special occasion when we join to felicitate family members who have given away everything of their near and dear ones for the good of another human being. Donate Life will get support for its humanitarian work across the country, President   said.

 
 
 He was speaking after felicitating the family members of cadaver donors in the city on Tuesday.
 
 President Kovind said organ donation is life donation. “Starting from organ harvesting to transplant, the whole process is a time management challenge, but a real blessing for the needy. There is a need to create an awareness about organ and body donation in the country. Human life is very precious. After our death also, we can give life to someone else through organ donation. The institute working for organ donation must be helped by all.” 
 
  governor O P Kohli said, “The institute should take the responsibility for education of donors’ children.” 
 
 Chief minister   said, “Gujarat government is pro-active in giving clearances for green corridor, special security etc. so as to ensure timely transportation of harvested organs for transplant. Expensive operations for organ transplant are being subsidized through Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. The state government is planning to set up an organ transplant university in Gujarat.” 
 
 Donate Life until now has collected in cadaver donations around 249 kidneys, 101 livers, six pancreas, 17 hearts and 212 corneas, which have given a new lease of life to 582 people across the country.
