LUCKNOW: In a first, the   is all set to reach out to Non Resident Indians (NRIs) having a UP connect across the globe to address their police-related grievances and enquiries through a dedicated system using social media platforms like Twitter and WhatsApp groups.

 The initiative involves creating country-specific Twitter handles, particularly for nations with sizeable population of people from UP and nomination of local coordinators for follow-up and updates on complaints by NRIs, and sharing necessary information or documents.
 
 
 “The idea was conceptualised during a recent meeting with a London-based corporate tax consultant   and her husband   who were very impressed by the functioning of our Twitter Seva following a first-hand experience,” said UP DGP, OP Singh. Broadbents expressed their desire to supplement our efforts abroad and Supriya was nominated as co-ordinator for UP police-related grievances and enquiries of NRIs for London chapter, added Singh.
 
 UP Police, one of the biggest police forces in the world, is now setting up dedicated twitter handles for regions across the globe and will appoint coordinators for these chapters, said  , who is translating the DGP’s idea into reality on ground.
 
 The co-ordiantors will inform   headquarters, through their official Twitter handles, about any kind of help needed in UP by any   or their family members in the state.
