They sought a weekâ€™s time to submit the report, which was accepted by the tribunal. The NGT also gave liberty to the petitioner and the other contesting respondents to file their response following submission of the joint inspection report. 
 
 The slaughterhouse was closed down by a joint team of Ghaziabad Development Authority, UPPCB and other departments concerned on January 20 after it was found that the unit was running without proper clearances. During the inspection, it was found that the pollution norms were not properly implemented. Moreover, the effluent treatment plant was also found to be not working properly, said an UPPCB official. 
 
 The next date of hearing in the case is on April 2.
