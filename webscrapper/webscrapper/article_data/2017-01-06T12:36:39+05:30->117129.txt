CHANDIGARH:   AAP leader Munish Raizada on Thursday announced ‘Chanda Bandh Satyagraha (No Donation campaign)’ in Punjab next week.

 The campaign was started at Rajghat in Delhi on December 24, 2016. Ever since it has distributed over 70,000 handbills and over 15,000 people have pledged not to donate to AAP unless it makes its donations public.
 
 Raizada, a suspended member of AAP, has called for a atyagraha since AAP has refused to make details of donations public. Earlier, he had written an open letter to AAP on the foundation day (Nov 26) with an appeal to disclose donations of the party in a week time.
 
 He alleged that AAP has taken down the list of donations from its website since June 2016. It coincided with the party receiving three notices from the income tax (I-T) department asking for explanation of certain discrepancies. The notice states, “The donation entries in the AAP website don’t match the Election Commission records, please furnish documentary evidences to explain the issue.”
