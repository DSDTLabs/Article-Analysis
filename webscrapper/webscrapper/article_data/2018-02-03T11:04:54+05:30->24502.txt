BENGALURU: Cryptocurrencies continued to plunge through most of Friday, a day after finance minister Arun   said in his Budget speech that they are not legal tender and the government would take all measures to eliminate their use as part of the payment system. But late evening, these currencies made a sharp recovery. By about 8 pm, they had not only recovered all of the Friday losses, but also some of Thursday’s.

 Jaitley’s statement also impacted cryptocurrency prices around the world, all of which fluctuated in line with the Indian movements. International media reported that drops over the past two days were largely on account of the proposed Indian action. 
 
 On Friday, bitcoin prices dropped some 15% to Rs 5.3 lakh (per bitcoin) compared to Thursday’s close. But by 8 pm, it was back at Rs 6.4 lakh.
 
 Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum, ripple, and litecoin also fell and rose similarly. Ether dropped 31% to hit a low of Rs 55,000 from a high of Rs 80,000 on Thursday. Litecoin dropped from a high of Rs 11,500 on Thursday to Rs 7,100 on Friday.
 
  
  
 
 But both made smart recoveries towards the end of the day. In the international market, the value of bitcoin plunged from $10,209 at the time of Jaitley’s speech to $9,873 in just two hours. On Friday, it fell to $7,848, but then rose to $8,800.
 
 Apart from India, the hit was also attributed to regulators from countries like the US, UK, and   now closely monitoring crypto-trading platforms.
 
 Indian crypto-trading platforms like  ,  ,  , and Coinsecure have been busy trying to salvage the situation, with many flooded with queries from nervous buyers on whether to sell their currencies or not.
