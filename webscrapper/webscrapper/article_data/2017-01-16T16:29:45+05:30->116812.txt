Movie: Shatamanam Bhavati
Music Director: Mickey J Meyer
 Rating: 3.5
  
 Review: It���s been a while since Mickey J Meyer composed for a Tollywood movie, but this album more than makes up for his absence. The first song Mellaga Tellarindoi sung by   Kulkarni, Ramya Behara and   is as melodic as it gets as the vocalists especially Anurag do a fine job. The catchy chorus and instrumentation make this a winner. The title track Shatamanam Bhavati sung by   and   is a grandiose effort as sitar and ghatam sounds bring in a very distinct rustic feel to the song. The vocalisation is also top notch. Sameera Bharadwaj takes up vocal duties for Naalo Nenu, a romantic track with a laidback groove. And although Sameera���s voice impresses, the song gets a bit monotonous as it progresses. Nilavade sung by SP Balasubramanyam is an out and out retro song. With congo beats and retro guitar sounds, the song sounds like something from the 70s and adds charm to the album. The final track Hailo Hailessare sung by Aditya Iyengar, Rohith Paritala, Mohana Bhogaraju and   is high on energy, and yet again Mickey continues the desi feet of this album with folksy beats. The song is sure to engage audiences and get them grooving. Staying true to the desi vibe of the movie, Mickey has composed more than a couple of hits in this album.
