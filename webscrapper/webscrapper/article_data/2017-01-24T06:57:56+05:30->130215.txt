SURAT: Investigation into the recent hooch tragedy that claimed six lives has revealed that the the prime suspect, Sheela, had mixed   in the liquor mix she sold to the victims, said police sources close to investigation. 

 Cops are surprised to know how bootleggers resort to different methods to meet the demand of liquor since police have tightened noose around illegal trade of country liquor and   (IMFL) in the region. 
 
 Recent investigation by Surat rural police after seizure of ready-to-mix powder used for preparing intoxicating toddy, revealed that the powder was chloral hydrate. It is the main content to make pesticide DDT and it was mixed with mixture of limestone and titanium for faster fermentation. If consumed regularly, the pesticide can prove fatal. The powder was seized from different parts of Surat district where it was sold freely since many years.
 
 It was further revealed that Sheela, a resident of  , brought the IMFL bottles from a supplier. She mixed the liquor with some liquid homeopathy medicine which had around 90% alcohol concentration, much higher than the IMFL. Whisky has around 50% alcohol concentration. 
 
 After mixing whisky and homeopathy medicine, water was mixed to dilute it. That helped the bootlegger increase quantity of liquor. Police also came to know that some food colour was also added to make it look like a good quality IMFL.
 
 Ultimately, the mixture was packed in transparent plastic pouch and sold at almost equal price of country liquor. However, police are not yet clear how the liquor mix turned toxic and how methyl got mixed into it. Methyl alcohol was found in viscera samples collected from all the six deceased. 
 
 All the victims who lost lives had arrived at the place where Sheela did business in Katargam and consumed liquor. Later, they separated and were found unconscious in different areas of the city.
