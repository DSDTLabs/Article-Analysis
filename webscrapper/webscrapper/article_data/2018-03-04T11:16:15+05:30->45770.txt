 He said arms are being smuggled from border areas of Maharashtra and also from Uttar Pradesh where they’re manufactured. Recently, Karnataka police seized an unlicenced gun in Vijayapura smuggled into Karnataka. “In the past month, our police seized a number of countrymade and unlicenced weapons during raids and arrested people connected to the underworld,” he said.
 
 Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the passing-out parade of women constables at the DAR parade ground in Jyothinagar here, Reddy said, “Our police have been regularly seizing unlicenced and countrymade weapons smuggled into the state. However, it’s the responsibility of states to prevent where they’re manufactured.”
 
 “Our police have been communicating to these two state governments to take measures to prevent manufacture of countrymade guns. We’re keeping a check on illegal smuggling and seizing unlicenced guns,” Reddy said.
 
 On dropping cases of some people in certain cases, Reddy said the BJP is politicizing it. “We’re only discussing dropping charges against groups of farmers, students and forest dwellers booked during protests or evictions. There are people from all communities,” he said.
 
 To a query, Reddy said, “It’s election time; opposition parties tend to make allegations. Our party doesn’t need any rowdies.”
