BAREILLY: In   district, 200 young women, mostly graduates, have motivated over 1,500 villagers, so far, to construct toilets in their houses, that too without getting any government aid. These girls stay at each village and educate residents about sanitation and hygiene. They use different tools to make villagers aware -by singing songs, playing skits, conducting march-pasts with school children and group discussions with different sections of society , narrating to them how open defecation affects their daily life.  , 26, who has visited around 75 villages so far, told TOI, “The biggest challenge we face, even from women, is to make them under stand about the importance of dignity. Some of them make excuses, like they cover their faces with dupattas while defecating in the open. But we don't lose hope and visit them again with innovative ideas to counter their arguments.“

 The volunteers said that educating men, especially elders, was more difficult than convincing women. “First we involve children of the villages. We then approach the youth, playing skits to inform them, and then we hold meetings with women. We understand their ordeal, so that we can give them suggestions. We tell them about how women and girls are sexually assaulted, while going out to the fields at night,“ explained another volunteer,  .
 
 “From men, we always get the same old reply , that they `feel good' while defecating in the open. But we are happy that our repeated efforts have changed their behaviour and people have started to use toilets which they built with their own money , without getting any financial aid from the government,“ Saini added.
 
 “Initially, we started the campaign in September 2015 without getting any financial help from the government or the administration. However, now the district panchayati raj office provides volunteers a stipend of Rs 7,500 each per month,“ said Dev Bhaskar Pandey , district coordinator of   in Saharanpur.
