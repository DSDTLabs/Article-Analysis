Madurai: There is a perception that Madurai lacks industrial buzz like the Western region of the state. But the temple city has quietly become the hub of specific industries, and paint brush making is just one of them. The city has evolved from a small bunch of cottage units to a place that has capacity to make 1 crore paint brushes per annum. The focus is now on producing 10 crore brushes by 2025. 

 The origin of the paint brush industry in Madurai can be traced to the 1960s when some entrepreneurs from Thirumangalam found an opportunity in making paint brushes. In those days, the paint brushes used to be made with pig hair. The brushmakers travelled to Sherkot in Uttar Pradesh where they learnt the art of making paint brushes, and returned to Madurai a few years later, starting five to six cottage units at Thirumangalam. Muthu Brush is one of the pioneering brands of Madurai.
 
 The next shift in the industry happened when Immanuel Dayal Walker from Du Pont filaments found that there was a small base of paint brush makers in the region during his visit to the city in 2003. He motivated a group of entrepreneurs in the city to use filaments in place of pig hair that was being imported from Sherkot.
 
 As the industry size started growing gradually, South Indian Paintbrush Manufacturers Association (SIPMA) was established in 2007 by paint brush makers, who wanted to turn the city into a brush manufacturing hub. In November last year, SIPMA in its eleventh anniversary reiterated its goal of turning the city into a major hub of paint brush making in the country.
 
 “There are places like Sherkot, Delhi where paint brushes are manufactured but Madurai is unique because our brushes last long due to their quality. We are in the process of linking all the scattered paint brush makers here into a consortium, so that we could scale up production and win orders in international markets”, says R Prabhuram, treasurer of SIPMA.
 
 However, the recent slump in the real estate sector and construction business due to shortage of sand has put the industry in a spot. While the orders have not grown in a big way, production costs including wages and raw materials remain the same. “It is a testing time for the industry but we are confident that we will surge back and these troubling times will be over soon”, said M N Selvasekaran from Padmashri brand, who heads SIPMA.
