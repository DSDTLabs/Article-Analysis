BENGALURU: “30 years is not a small period, you know.” No it’s not. That's how long  , a former footballer who played for Delhi, has been associated with  , which is competing in the final round of the   here. “I took over sometime in 1983-84,” says the club president.

 
 It's been a long and arduous journey for Bose and his club. Founded in 1948 by   — the first secretary of Delhi's football body — Hindustan is a club that has never played in the first division. That remains their Holy Grail.
 
 “This is the third time we are in the final round of the second division. It's good if we can make it (gain promotion) because at least one team from Delhi can play in the top division and our presence will be there.”
 
 Now, as they kickstart their three-match round robin final round against   on Thursday — in their 14th time of asking — there is more than just a spot in the top division up for grabs. Hindustan is trying to ignite a vibrant football culture in the Capital. The only northern presence in the   comes from surprise champions Minerva Punjab FC and development team Indian Arrows.
 
 And no one is more aware of this responsibility than coach Vikrant Sharma, a goalkeeper from Delhi who spent most of his career in Goa. “It will be a huge achievement in Delhi if we can (qualify for ILeague and) change the mindset. How important, we'll know only if things change. If we qualify and nothing changes then what is the point? At the grassroots level if things change, then we have made an impact. We hope to make that change,” stressed Sharma.
