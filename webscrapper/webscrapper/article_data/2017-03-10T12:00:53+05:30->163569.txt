HYDERABAD: Charminar may have inspired hundreds of poets and writers over the centuries, but a little-known book penned by one of the  ,   from  , has sent intelligence officers of Telangana on a wild goose chase. What has stumped them is just why the cover page of the 50page book, titled `Successor of   in India', displays the photo of the 425-year-old heritage structure.

 Intelligence officers are trying to find if there is any link between the alleged Islamic State module of Khurasan and the local sympathisers. Atif had not mentioned anything about Hydera bad or Telangana in his book, but cops are baffled why he chose Charminar for the cover with `Islamic State' on top of it. He even posted his 50-page book on the web, which was blocked by security agencies after the Khurasan module was busted in MP and UP based on Telangana police inputs.
 
 “This module has no links with Hyderabad or Telangana.Though Charminar was on the cover, we found it has nothing to do with the state,“ a senior Telangana police officer told TOI.
 
 The book mainly talks about promoting an extremist ideology , quotes issues faced by Muslims in Kashmir and Assam and bats for the formation of the Islamic `Caliphate'. Contrary to earlier reports, it was only in the last few days that Telangana police began tracking chats of the Khurasan module on Telegram. “We came across some chats and they were put under watch. After the blast, we suspected they were behind it as they indicated their role“ a source said.
 
 Till now, eight from the module have been arrested in MP and UP . A team of the Telangana police are reportedly in MP to gather more information about the module.
