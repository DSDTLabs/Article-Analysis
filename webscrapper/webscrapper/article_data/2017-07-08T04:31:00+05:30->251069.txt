Nagpur: At this point in our country, where Muslims are being lynched and the definition of ‘Hindutva’ is being debated, a much-appreciated play on former RSS chief Gowalkar Guruji was revived for the benefit of the viewers. ‘Idam Na Mama’, written by Shubhangi Bhadbhade and directed by Sarika Pendse, was first produced in 2006, and has been shown in many places including Leh and Ladakh. The play literally means, ‘Nothing is mine’. It was staged at Vasantrao Deshpande hall, Civil Lines, on Friday evening.

 Girish Khatri played the role of a young Guruji, whereas Sanjay Pendse enacted Dr Hedgewar. Sarika Pendse, Nachiket Mhsailkar and Prashant Mangde also played prominent roles. The play began to the sound of conch, followed by resonating chants of Om. The first scene directly transports the viewer to Guruji's past, where several of his students ask him how he manages to read so much, before finally claiming, “From now on, you will be our guruji”.
 
 “RSS is not just about exercises but discipline, culture and socialization,” said Guruji, enacted by Sahil Patwardhan. Two act Marathi play did well in highlighting some of the most characteristic traits of Guruji, and moments from his life — how Hedgewar elected him to lead RSS, his meet with Vallabhbhai Patel, his teachings to followers of the group and more. This was achieved through frequent blackouts which didn't hamper the flow of the story. The backdrop was simple melange of colours, and there was minimal use of props. The music in the background was light and cheerful. It was interspersed with narration of Gogalwar's thoughts.
 
 Mayor Nanda Jichkar, RSS’ Sarakaryavah, Bhaiyya Joshi, senior RSS functionary Manmohan Vaidya and celebrity chef Vishnu Manohar were some of the guests of the event. Manohar was also felicitated for his achievements.
