NEW DELHI: Even as the strike by Ola and Uber drivers entered the seventh day, Delhi transport minister Satyendar Jain claimed most taxis were   on the road. He also claimed that autorickshaws weren’t overcharging and that violence by striking cab drivers was a law and order problem to be tackled by Delhi Police. 

 Commuters, of course, had a different take. They had to pay astronomical fares on app-based taxis, while many complained of being fleeced by autorickshaw drivers. “I have booked an Uber with a wait time of nine minutes, but the rates are nearly double. It usually takes Rs 150 till Indraprastha, but today, the ride estimate was Rs 250-300,” said Sanjay Kumar, waiting outside the New Delhi railway station. 
 
 Prashant Jindal, another commuter at Noida Sector 18, managed to book an Uber ride to Rohini after several attempts. “I’m a regular commuter. A few days ago, the situation was bad due to the strike. But now, though cabs are available, the rates are still high,” Jindal said. 
 
 Jain offered to speak to the LG to look into the allegations of intimidation levelled by cabbies wanting to return to work. 
 
 Meanwhile, Sarvodaya Drivers Association of Delhi said it would continue with the strike. “We had approached a senior official of Ola to resolve the issue, but it didn’t work out. The company didn’t agree to any of the demands made by the drivers. The officials said if the drivers are okay with the current plans, they can come on duty or else we can continue with the strike,” said association spokesperson Anwar Ali. Kamaljeet Gill, president of the association, who was on a hunger strike since last Friday, was admitted to RML hospital on Thursday.
 
 Fishing in the troubled waters were representatives of some political parties. While the association has been claiming that BJP state president Manoj Tiwari will join the strike, Shiv Sena’s Delhi chief Neeraj Sethi joined in on Thursday.
