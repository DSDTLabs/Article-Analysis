MUMBAI:   has become the first state to implement the Centre directive to ban the   and   (FMCG) under one roof. The   welfare had proposed the move last September to prevent   products.

 The state Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an order to this effect on January 9. “The Union government had suggested that tobacco be sold exclusive of FMCG products so that children are not exposed to them. Children could get influenced by tobacco products when they go to buy chips or chocolates,” said FDA commissioner Pallavi Darade.
 
 While the rule has come into force following the directive, the FDA is hoping for self-compliance once there is awareness. “We assume people of Maharashtra are law abiding and will comply with the orders once they come to know about it. Once there is awareness about it, we will then take action. There is a provision to cancel licences and registrations, we may also file a case in civil court which may then lead to an imprisonment of up to six months plus fine,” Darade said.
 
 All establishments require a licence from FDA to sell food items. A government official said, “Since gutka and tobacco are classified as food, any ban or regulation would come under the FDA's ambit.”
 
 While the Global Adult Tobacco Survey Maharashtra released in December 2017 showed a decline in tobacco use in the last seven years, there is cause for concern because usage among the 15-17 age group has increased from 2.9% in 2010 to 5.5% in 2017, i.e., a relative increase of 90%. Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi from Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, said, “Research shows 90% of tobacco users started as teens and once addicted less than 5% of users are able to quit.” In India, every year, there are 1 lakh new cases of oral cancer of which 50% die within 12 months.
