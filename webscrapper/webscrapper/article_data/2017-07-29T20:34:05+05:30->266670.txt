BENGALURU: The Karnataka   ordered   to pay a compensation of Rs 10,000, Rs 2,000 towards costs and also refund the ticket fare to a 58-year-old passenger who said he had to put up with three hours of suffocating journey in a train because of the dysfunctional air-conditioning system. 

  The passenger, Dr Shekar S, a Mysurean, was travelling from Bengaluru to   on the Tipu Superfast Express on March 9, 2015, and the journey was to be covered in three hours. When he got into the air-conditioned C1 coach, he realized the   was not working. He complained to the AC mechanic in the train immediately. 
 
 
 
  The mechanic's effort to fix the problem went in vain, causing inconvenience to the passengers. The complainant later demanded a refund of the fare from the railways for what he described was "a miserable journey". 
 
  He also approached the District Consumer  . The railways told the court the train had a normally functioning AC from Dharwad to Bengaluru, but due to wear and tear which could not be fixed in a short time, a problem occurred on the Bengaluru-Mysuru stretch. 
 
 
 
 
  The forum ordered the railways to pay the passenger Rs 3,000 as compensation and Rs 2,000 towards costs, besides a penalty of Rs 100 per day in case of default. The aggrieved passenger demanded a higher compensation of Rs 15,000 and appealed to the Karnataka State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, which considered the adverse effect on the health of the complainant travelling for three hours in suffocation, and his age, before enhancing the compensation to Rs 10,000. The orders for enhanced compensation were given by President of Commission Justice B S Indrakala. 
 
  Four-week deadline 
 
  The railways was also asked to pay other costs within four weeks, from the d ate of receipt of the copy of the order.
