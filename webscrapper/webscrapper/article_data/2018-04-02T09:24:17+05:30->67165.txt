NEW DELHI: On this day in 2011, India ended a 28-year World Cup drought by winning their second title in front of a manic home crowd at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.

 
 
 
 In a moment for the ages, Indian skipper   clobbered Sri Lankan pacer Nuwan Kulasekara high over the long-on fence to spark widespread celebrations in India. The architects of India's triumph on that night in Mumbai were  ,   and Dhoni.
 
 
 
 In a miserly opening spell, Zaheer conceded just the six runs in five overs banishing the ghosts of his nervous first spell in the 2003 World Cup final. Chasing 275 and despite being reduced to 31 for two, Gambhir, as he had done in India's T20 WC final win in 2007, top-scored with 97 and shared a crucial fourth-wicket stand with Dhoni (91*), who had promoted himself above Man-of-the-Series Yuvraj Singh to negate the threat posed by Sri Lanka's spinners.
 
 Sachin Tendulkar, who won the World Cup in his sixth attempt, called it the proudest moment of his life.
