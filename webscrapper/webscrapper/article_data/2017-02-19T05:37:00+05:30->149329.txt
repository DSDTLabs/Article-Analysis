JAIPUR: Birbal Gurjar, who along with four others had begun an indefinite hunger strike at Sikandra near Dausa on Thursday, was admitted into   on Saturday after his health began deteriorating.

 Himmat Singh, spokesperson of Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, told TOI that Biral Gurjar, a resident of Sikar, was rushed to Jaipur after his health started deteriorating due to hunger strike. 
 
 He added that condition of four other protesters who too were on hunger strike along with Birbal is also deteriorating. 
 
 According to Himmat Singh, the five protesters on Thursday reached Sikandra and started an indefinite hunger strike to express their dissatisfaction against the incumbent government for failing to provide special backward classes (SBC) quota to their community.
 
 The four protesters, apart from Birbal, are   (Dausa), Satish Gurjar (Kotputli), Sanjay Gurjar (Jhunjhunu) and Nanda Gurjar (Alwar).
 
 The samiti leaders on Wednesday had boycotted a scheduled meeting with the cabinet sub-committee in Jaipur. The senior leaders of the movement, including   had accused Rajasthan government of backtracking on its assurance, which among several other promises included granting appointment letters to SBC candidates selected against nearly 4,000 posts in different departments. 
 
 The state government was left in the lurch after the   struck down the SBC quota, while the apex court did accept the state’s appeal against the high court’s verdict, it did not grant stay in the matter. This led to Gujjars and four other communities being deprived of all reservation benefits that were earlier available to them.
