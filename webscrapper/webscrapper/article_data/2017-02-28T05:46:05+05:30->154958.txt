Mumbai: The proposal to convert the mayor’s   in Shivaji Park into a   to Shiv Sena founder   Thackeray received its final approval from the BMC house on Monday. 

 The proposal was cleared without discussion. It had already received a go-ahead from the civic improvements committee on January 11.
 
 The plot, about 11,500 square metres, would be handed over to a trust. A senior official said the draft lease deed would now be prepared. 
 
 “For making any kind of change they would need the consent of the heritage committee, mainly as the bungalow is a listed heritage structure,” the official said. 
 
 The plot is to be given to the trust at an annual rent of Re 1.
