AMARAVATI: Muslim minority leaders in the state are fuming over chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu ignoring their community in the cabinet reshuffle. They alleged that Naidu is working with a single-point agenda to cement the bond with the   (BJP). This is the first TDP government in the last three decades to run without a minority face in the cabinet. 

 Naidu's decision to not accommodate minorities in the first cabinet was also brought on by the fact that the party's lone minority candidate lost the election and no other leader was available to take a place in the cabinet. Subsequently, the party brought senior leader and general secretary M A Sheriff into the legislative council. In addition, two minority legislators, Attar   and Jaleel Khan, joined the party from YSRC hoping to join the cabinet. But the party did not consider inducting any of the three available minority legislators. Although Sheriff's name was in contention from West Godavari district, Naidu ignored it on the ground that there is no minority vote bank in the district.
 
 The party then thought of taking Chand Basha from Anantapur with an eye on minority votes in Rayalaseema. But Basha too was ticked off when finance minister   lobbied for fellow BC leader   from West Godavari district. 
 
 "Naidu will be taught a lesson in the next elections. We are not going to keep quiet," said Muslim leader   of Guntur. Another leader Muneer Ahmed lashed out at the CM for meting out a stepmotherly treatment to Muslims.
