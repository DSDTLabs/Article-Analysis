MUMBAI: Some   drivers went off the mobile app platform on Thursday afternoon to highlight “driver safety”. A delegation met senior Ola officials in Andheri with a memorandum, which led to shortage of cabs, sources said.

 Yakub Mehta of the   said, “Scores of   are supporting the agitation. We are demanding protection for driver partners who are at the receiving end from customers. Recently, a driver was assaulted in Navi Mumbai, while we have got complaints of customers abusing or misbehaving with drivers. In such cases, we demand that drivers should also have rights to get their grievances redressed.”
 
 Mehta said the delegation of driver partners met senior officials from Ola and sought an ‘SOS’ button for drivers in the app. Commuters, whom this newspaper spoke to, said drivers too misbehaved and were unruly at times, and the union should first ‘‘set its own house in order’’.
 
 The stir was called off late afternoon, he said. A source from Ola denied services were affected on Thursday. “As far as driver grievance is concerned, there is a dedicated helpline. Besides, a team of dedicated staff at our office to listen to their complaints. We also have a customer rating system in the app in which drivers can give poor ratings to such customers,” the sources said.
 
 “In case of Ola Share, we do not allow passengers to carry heavy luggage, but many shout at us for not allowing them to carry a suitcase in a shared cab,” Mehta said. Another union leader, Raju Patil, said, “Drivers are humiliated and abused if they stop passengers from lighting cigarettes during late night journeys.”
