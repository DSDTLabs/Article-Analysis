Vadodara: M S University’s Faculty of Social Work has signed a MoU with Ahmedabad-based International Institute of Management and Technical (IIMT) Studies whereby corporate leaders will share their expertise and experience with young budding professionals of bachelor of social work, master of social work and master of human resource management programmes of the faculty. 

 “We have entered into knowledge partnership with IIMT Studies which conducts regular training of different corporates. Through this partnership, the institute will bring eminent persons from the corporate sector to our faculty without any financial burden on us. Our students will immensely benefit from this,” said dean of Faculty of Social Work professor M N Parmar. 
 
 “The faculty’s teaching provides regular teaching to the students. But the students get less exposure when it comes to know what the industry expectations are, what are the trends in the industry and future implications. Through this partnership, we will help faculty students get this exposure,” said Atul Pandya from IIMT Studies, who is also an alumnus of the faculty. 
 
 “We have been providing leadership development and enhancing managerial competence training to almost all major industries of Gujarat and have 28 senior personnel from corporate sector, including CEOs, vice-president and directors on board. Every month, we will be bringing top class professionals to share their expertise and experience with the students,” added Pandya.
