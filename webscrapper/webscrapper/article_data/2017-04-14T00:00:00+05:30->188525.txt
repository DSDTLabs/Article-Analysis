The undercut, which by itself was a   statement last year, is getting sassier. A more sparkly, bedazzled   is here to help you make a bolder and fearless look at music festivals. A video of hairstylist Cici Andersen creating the look has gone viral. To get the look, a design is created on the undercut using a trimmer. Then, firm hold gel is mixed with   to create the pattern and accentuate the geometric shapes with rhinestones and studs. To turn more heads, you can dye your hair in neon colours, preferably smurf blue â€” the hair colour of the season.
