MADURAI: Many from among the crowd who had come to Othakadai from across   to attend   Haasan’s first public meeting said they would vote for him in the next elections.

 R Bhuvana and M   from Madurai had come not only because they were fans, but also because they believed Kamal could lead Tamil Nadu. While Bhuvana said she was yet to decide about voting for Kamal, Rajkumar said the actor would be the best bet post J Jayalalithaa. “My vote in the next election would definitely be for him,” he said.
 
 Several people had gathered at the venue before noon to get seats and S Paramesh from Dindigul was one among them. “Though he is yet to announce his policy, I know it will be a political party without corruption and I will vote for him because he will be a good leader,” he said.
 
 Those who had voted for the   because of Jayalalithaa said Kamal could be their choice now. “We always voted for Amma. Now we have a good alternative and are confident that he will help people like us who depend on daily wages,” said M Sevanayee from Virudhunagar.
 
 Civil engineers R Prakash and M   had come from Avinashi. The two said they had earlier voted for the AIADMK because of Jayalalithaa. “But with her gone, Tamil Nadu is in a very bad shape. I think Kamal Haasan would be the best option because we have faced lot of losses under the present government in our field,” said Prakash.
 
 Sixty-year-old Parasuraman, who had grown up watching Kamal on screen, had taken a night bus from Dharmapuri and reached the venue early in the morning, and he is not spoilt for choices in the next poll either. “I am a diehard fan of the actor. I have voted for the AIADMK and the DMK, but hereafter, I will vote only for Kamal,” he said.
 
 Arunkumar, 18, a first time voter said Kamal would be his choice too. “My first vote will go to him,” he said.
