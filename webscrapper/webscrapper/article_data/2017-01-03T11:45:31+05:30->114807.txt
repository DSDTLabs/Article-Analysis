NAGPUR: To woo voters in the 2017  , Bharatiya Janata Party-led   (NMC) has decided to seek relaxation in the 10% ‘big building tax’ being recovered by the state government from property taxpayers. The state’s approval of this proposal will benefit all municipal corporations.

 Chairman of tax consultative committee Girish Deshmukh said a resolution was passed in its meeting and will now be sent to the government for approval. “10% big building premises tax is levied by the government since September 12, 1979. It is applicable on properties measuring 150 sq m and above, or on properties whose annual letting value is Rs1,500 and above. Nowadays, even a poor person builds a property spread over 150 sq m. Many taxpayers are finding it difficult to pay the tax amount. Therefore, NMC will request the government to increase the criteria to 200 sq m and above, or properties with annual letting value of Rs10,000 and above. Percentage of big building premises tax is also proposed in slab system for 200 sq m and above properties. Over 60% taxpayers will benefit if the government approves the proposal,” he said.
 
 Deshmukh also said 38% of the property tax target has been recovered as on December 31. “Revenue collection in local body tax (LBT) and market is around 60% of target,” he said.
 
 NMC data shows the total demand in property tax is Rs393.50 crore, of which current demand was Rs162.79 crore and arrears Rs230.71 crore. Of this, Rs115 crore has been recovered between April 1 and December 31. Revenue is Rs2 crore more than last fiscal. Usually, revenue at this stage is around Rs25 crore short as compared to the preceding year.
 
 Deshmukh said 66,000 taxpayers paid arrears by depositing demonetized notes of Rs500 and Rs1,000. “NMC collected arrears of Rs29.03 crore. Some paid arrears pending since 1970-71. I would like to thank Prime Minister   and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for permitting citizens to pay taxes using demonetized notes,” he said.
 
 However, NMC may again fall short of revenue target in property tax. Out of the target of Rs306 crore, NMC may end the fiscal at around Rs200 crore. Last year, the revenue was Rs174 crore.
 
 December 31 was the last date to pay property tax. Only 2.61 lakh of total 5.30 lakh taxpayers have paid the tax. The remaining 49% taxpayers will have to pay 2% per month interest from January 1 onwards.
 
 In LBT, NMC’s recovery is Rs461 crore as against target of Rs700 crore and Rs4.59 crore as against target of Rs7.55 crore.
