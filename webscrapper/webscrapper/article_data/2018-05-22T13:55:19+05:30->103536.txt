PATNA: The state cabinet on Monday approved abolition of car and motorcycle advances that were being given to the officials and employees in the state and judicial services cadres in compliance with the   recommendations.

 The cabinet also gave its nod to a proposal to impose cess on mining materials like sand, stone chips and earth dug from the fields to raise a corpus fund that would be used by the   (DMF). Since the DMF is yet to be set up, the amount of cess has not been decided so far, Singh said.
