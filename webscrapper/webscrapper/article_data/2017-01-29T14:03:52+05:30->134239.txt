VISAKHAPATNAM: With the Telugu community among the largest NRI groups in the US contributing to tech and innovation, it was but natural that the ‘Sunrise   Investment Meet’ dedicated a separate session on Saturday to deliberate on how the India-US relationship would shape up in the Trump era.

 Lisa Curtis, a senior research fellow at the Asian Studies Center of the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy in the US, pointed out that the US was certainly not going to shut its doors to the world but the mantra now would be to make a transition from ‘Free Trade’ to ‘Free and Fair Trade’.
 
 However, she was also quick to add that one need not over analyse Trump’s tweets as they were directed to his supporters and constituencies.
 
 While she said it would be hard to predict how the Indo-US bilateral relations in multiple sectors such as IT and energy shaped up, the collaboration between India and the US in the fight against terrorism would surely strengthen.
 
 “The one area, where I am fairly confident that the US and India will continue to work together is to stabilise Afghanistan and (to eliminate) the terrorism that emanates from Pakistan… But in order to achieve our objectives in Afghanistan, the new team in US will quickly understand that we need a new approach towards Pakistan,” she said.
 
 This apart, she said that India-US ties would only improve as India was a ‘strategic’ partner. “India has become critical to the US’s   policy. Things like the   signed in 2015 remain extremely valid and now that we see Trump administration’s approach to China…the momentum of the relationship (with India) will continue,” she added.
 
 Stating the concerns of the IT industry, former   chairman and Cyient executive chairman BVR Mohan Reddy stated that the H-1B issue continued to bother Indian IT companies.
