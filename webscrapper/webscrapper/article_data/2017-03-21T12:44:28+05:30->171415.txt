CHARMINAR:   between Darul Shifa and   has left commuters fuming. Travellers complain that they are forced to stand under the scorching heat to board a bus, owing to the absence of shelters. Right from senior citizens to women and even students, everybody is affected by the unavailability of shelters at multiple stops along this stretch. These include: Darulshifa, Mir Chowk, Kotla Alijah, Edi Bazaar and Shah Ali Banda. 

 "Commuters suffer every day as they have to spend more than 15 to 30 minutes waiting for the buses in the heat. The authorities must do something to address this," said  , a resident of Mir Chowk. Another commuter, Syed Wajid, made a similar appeal. "Such is the situation that people are often forced to use their private vehicles - as opposed to opting for buses - only to avoid waiting in the scorching heat. The transport department must realise that it is an extremely serious issue and needs immediate attention," Wajid added.
 
 For Md Sayeed, an employee of a private school, the situation is no different. Sharing his grievance he said how it's a daily struggle waiting at the Darushifa bus stop, especially during peak summer. "Now-a-days, it has become unbearable to wait for buses sans shelters. I get off at the Darul Shifa stop and waiting to board the connecting bus from there is torture. Something has to be done,'' Md   said.
