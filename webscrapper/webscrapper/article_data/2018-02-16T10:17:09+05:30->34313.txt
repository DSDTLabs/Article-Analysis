JAMMU: The strategic   national highway that had remained closed for the last four days, was restored for one-way traffic on Friday.

 "Traffic will move from   to Srinagar. No vehicle will be allowed in the opposite direction," a traffic official said.
 
 The highway had remained closed due to multiple landslides in   and   districts stranding thousands of passengers on both sides.
 
 Over 2,000 vehicles were stuck at various places on the highway during this period.
