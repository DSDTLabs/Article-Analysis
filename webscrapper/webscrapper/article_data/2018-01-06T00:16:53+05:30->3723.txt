Tirupur: The Tnstc employees’ strike affected normalcy in the district as only about 10% of the state-run buses operated on Friday. Meanwhile, making use of the significant number of private bus services here, Tirupur Tnstc zone authorities ‘deployed’ unapproved private tourist buses to keep afloat the bus services in the district. Still, many people faced inconvenience to get buses to various destinations, both in-station and out-station. Both the Old Bus Stand and the New Bus Stand sported a deserted look as the day progressed. “Many school and college students, and labourers faced difficulties in getting buses during the morning hours,” said S Sivaraman, a fruit seller, who had to sleep at the Old Bus Stand on Thursday night due to the strike. As many as 583 buses, including city and mofussil buses, were operated in Tirupur Tnstc zone, which includes whole Tirupur district and Palani depot. “Only around 40 buses could be operated as most of the 4,000 employees involved in the strike got indirect support of 90% of AIADMK-affiliated Anna Thozhilar Peravai (ATP),” said Subramani, treasurer of the Tirupur chapter of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (Citu). In order to save its image, Tnstc officials parked a few buses at both the bus terminuses, giving the impression that they will start operation any second. “For them, even if a bus leaves the depot, it can be termed as service operation,” said CItu local secretary Chelladurai.
