Panaji: The seven-storied   that houses important government offices, remained largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities and senior citizens as both its elevators were shut down on Tuesday for maintenance work. 

 The childrenâ€™s court, office of the commissioner of labour and employment, directorate of skill development and entrepreneurship, employment exchange, department of tribal welfare, and the office of the state registrar and Goa State Urban Development Agency (GSUDA) are all located in this building at Patto. 
 
 While one elevator has been out of order for over two months, the second one was shut down on Tuesday.
 
 The Goa State Human Rights Commission had conducted a survey of government buildings in 2015, after an orthopedically challenged government employee filed a complaint stating that Shram Shakti Bhavan was inaccessible as the ramp has been constructed at the rear of the building, and haphazardly parked vehicles blocked access to the ramp.
 
 The panel had subsequently recommended that the government ensure accessiblity for the disabled to the building. The non-functioning elevators have only aggravated the situation.
