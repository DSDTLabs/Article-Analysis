NAGPUR: With just 25 days left for the 10-day  , the   ( ) has framed guidelines for  .

 Accordingly, the NMC has restricted the height of pandals up to 60ft. If any mandal wishes to increase the heights higher than 60ft, then it would be mandatory to get structure stability test (SST) done by NMC’s zonal deputy engineer. “But no SST will be required for mandals with 25ft-high pandal,” said a senior NMC official.
 
 This year, with a view to ease permissions for mandals for the Ganesh festival, the civic body has decided to decentralize the one-window system.
 
 The official told TOI that this year, all the 10 zonal offices will be authorized to give permissions or no-objection certificates to erect pandals for Ganeshotsav.
 
 Until last year, there was only the single window for obtaining permission at NMC’s headquarters. This year, the NMC has decided to give permissions only if the mandals produce NOC from city police, the senior official said.
 
 As per its policy, the NMC has also decided to levy a fee of Rs 5 for per sq ft while allowing pandals for the 10-day festival.
 
 The mandals will have to submit an affidavit in Rs100 stamp paper detailing the proper map of place where temporary pandals would be raised. The mandals will also have to follow environment norms and also take temporary electric meter connections.
 
 There are around 1,150 Ganesh mandals in the city. But of these, only 950 had applied for permissions last year, while 54 applications were rejected for various reasons including blocking of roads while approvals were given to 530 mandals.
