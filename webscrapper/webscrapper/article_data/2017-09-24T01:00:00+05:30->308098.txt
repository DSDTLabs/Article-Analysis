BUXAR: BJP’s intellectual cell member  , who was allegedly assaulted by two   of electricity department on March 10 this year, has been running from pillar to post for justice, but to no avail. 

 Police had registered Paswan’s complaint two months after the incident on the instruction of a local court. However, no action has so far been taken against the accused engineers – Santosh Kumar and   Prasad Singh. The duo had been booked under different sections of SC/ST Act. Sources in electricity department said although Surendra was transferred to Lakhisarai, Santosh continues to be in Buxar district. 
 
 “In the last six months, I have written to almost everyone, including chairman of Bihar State Power (Holding) Company Limited and State Human Rights Commission, but nothing has happened,” Paswan said. 
 
 SHO of SC/ST police station Ahileshwar Dinesh said since the case was lodged with Town police station, he has submitted the final report in the court as the SC/ST police station has no role to play in the case.
