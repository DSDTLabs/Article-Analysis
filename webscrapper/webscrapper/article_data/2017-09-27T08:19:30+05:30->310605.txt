AHMEDABAD: Justice (retd) M B Shah, chairman of the special investigation team (SIT) formed by the   to probe `black money' cases, attributed the fundamental constitutional right assured under Article 22 (1) to the era of Lord Ram, while speaking at   (GNLU) in Gandhinagar on Monday.

 At the launch of the `Chair on Ethics and Values in Legal and  ' at GNLU, the former Supreme Court judge said, “Article 22 (1) specifically provides that no person shall be arrested and detained in custody without being informed nor he shall be denied the right to consult a legal practitioner of his choice. That is the fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution. It is appears that above said practice was followed in this country for centuries.“
 
 “Hanuman was convicted by Ravan, who said you can't leave this area and have been awarded capital punishment. Ravan's brother then came there and said that this is against the dharma shashtras and the death sentence for Hanuman should be qu ashed. This shows that this country for years practised the fundamental right that a person should be heard before being convicted,“ added Shah, who also holds the post of chairman at Gujarat State Law Commission.
 
 Shah, who had probed the illegal mining of iron ore in Goa in 2013-14, also expressed concerns about the increasing pollution in the state and country.
 
 Cyril Shroff, managing partner of Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas Shroff and company, who set up the chair, on Monday said that lawyers should become like Lord Krishna and steer their client's chariots the proper way.
