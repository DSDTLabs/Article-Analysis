SURAT: Surat district is considered as one of the areas with   cover in the state. But   has lowest tree cover among all cities of the state. The major reason is deforestation due to rapid  .

 Gujarat forest department conducts tree census every five years. Its 2013 data shows that there were 1.46 crore trees in Surat district with Surat city area accounting for 3.7 lakh trees. If tree density for Surat district was 36.25 per hectare, it was just 8.4 for Surat city. 
 
 Punit Nayyar, district forest Officer (DFO), social forestry department, said, “Tree population is growing due to farm forestry in Surat district. However, urbanization and infrastructure facilities were gobbling up greenery of city areas.”
 
 Municipal commissioner   said, “We need to verify this census figures. There seems to be something seriously wrong. We would be conducting our own census for exact tree count shortly.” 
 
 SMC garden superintendent said, “We have planted more than 10 lakh trees from 2003 onwards. If the survival rate is 60 per cent, we still must have been left with six lakh trees. This census figure is not right. Nobody came to us for the census. How can we believe these figures when we have planted at least 3.5 lakh trees starting 2012-13?”
 
 These figures provided by SMC is that of the number of saplings planted by it in the city and not of trees. 
 
 The forest department’s 2013 figures show that Surat has just 7.48 trees per person when the ideal figure for any urban unit is a tree per three persons. Ideally Surat city must have at least 18 lakh trees for its 50 lakh population.
