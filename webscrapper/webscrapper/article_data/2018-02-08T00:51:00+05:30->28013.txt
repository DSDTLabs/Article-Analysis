Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday reserved its order on a habeas corpus petition filed by a Lankan woman refugee against the police harassment she and her family were subjected to.

 T Uthayakala staying at Mandapam refugee camp had filed a case praying to issue a direction to the Q branch police to release her husband Thayapararajah who is lodged in the special camp in Mandapam in Rameswaram. She had also sought action against a few police officials for harassing her and releasing photos of their children to the media.
 
 Her counsel told the court that since the petitionerâ€™s husband has been lodged in a special camp, Q branch inspector Kennedy is continuously harassing her demanding bribe. When she refused to give it, he started threatening her over phone by saying that a false case would be filed against her and family members, which she recorded on her mobile. The inspector who came to know about it, began torturing her, against which she filed a case before the high court bench seeking police protection. After hearing concerned sides, a division bench of justices S Vimala and T Krishnavalli reserved its order.TNN
