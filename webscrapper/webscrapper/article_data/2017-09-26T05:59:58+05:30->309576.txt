GANDHINAGAR: A day after AICC vice-president   kicked off   from   in Dev-Bhoomi Dwarka, on Tuesday, BJP president   arrived in Ahmedabad on a three-day visit. With both Gandhi and Shah in the state, the onset of the election season in Gujarat's political climate can be felt quite strongly. 

 Ostensibly, Shah is coming to enjoy   with his family, but he has a series of political meetings lined up. He will be holding meetings with all state BJP units (morchas) like tribal, scheduled castes, women, OBC, IT and social media cell, and also hold meetings with state BJP office bearers and the CM.
 
 Shah will also have separate meetings with 120 observers who were assigned to ascertain the political reality of the 182 assembly seats for choosing the right candidates. Shah will also give final touch to BJP's Gaurav Vikas Yatra scheduled to start from October 1, and PM's mega page-pramukh(electoral page in-charge) meeting on October 16. He will also take stock of the planning of a series of programmes scheduled ahead of assembly elections.
 
 On the Congress side, after the three-day long yatra in Saurashtra, Rahul will organise a three-day long roadshow in north Gujarat and thereafter in south and central Gujarat before Diwali. Rahul and Sonia Gandhi are likely to take part in several public meetings. 
 
 On the BJP side, Prime Minister   and BJP president Amit Shah will be reaching out to masses from October. Amit Shah will take part in a fortnight-long Gaurav Yatra from October 1, which will be attended by the PM on its last day at Ahmedabad.
