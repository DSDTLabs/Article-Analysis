Vadodara: The   ( ) management dominated by Chirayu Amin-led Revival Group has decided to file a contempt of court against the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (COA) alleging that they had overstepped the brief given by the apex court.

 The decision was taken during the managing committee meeting held on Tuesday to discuss the   recommendations and the reply to be submitted to COA. 
 
 “The   has issued certain directions to COA and asked it to administrate BCCI temporarily. The COA has to get details regarding the office-bearers but it is seeking much more information that is beyond its brief. There is a difference between what SC has stated in its order and what COA is asking for. So we will be filing contempt of court against the COA within next couple of days,” said Amar Petiwale, BCA in-charge secretary. The association was to send status report regarding implementation of Lodha Committee’s recommendations to the BCCI by Wednesday evening but it has decided to seek time till March 27 to file reply. “All cricket associations took legal counsel from Kapil Sibal and we have decided to seek extension for filing reply to the COA. We will seek legal counsel from our advocate Vijay Shirke before filing replies now on,” BCA treasurer, Amul Jikar added. 
 
 Four managing committee members of the  , however, boycotted the meeting by terming it as unconstitutional.  , in fact, sent a notice to the Snehal Parikh and Amar Petiwale stating that the meeting is illegal as HC had asked BCA to maintain status quo. Gaekwad threatened to file contempt of court against the duo. Gaekwad has also written a lengthy letter to the COA and sought to appoint an administrator at BCA and take charge of all daily affairs. 
 
 ‘Leaving BCA in hands of illegal and authorized people would further the situation of the association and put its funds at great risk of being misused,’ the letter states.
