Panaji: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has questioned the legality of the ministers interrogating the accused Francis Pereira regarding the desecration of religious symbols in the state.  Questioning the legal provisions which allowed chief minister Manohar Parrikar, town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai and Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral to question Pereira, AAP’s state convener Elvis Gomes said that the investigation has been compromised. “The politicians have compromised the investigation by making statements about the suspect,” he said. AAP leader Valmiki Naik stated that the decision to allow ministers in the investigation is uncalled for. “Chief minister Manohar Parrikar has flouted rules in the past, during demonetization and the recent public meeting of BJP national president Amit Shah at Dabolim airport. We will ask the inspector of the Curchorem police station whether they will continue be part of the investigation too,” Naik said.
