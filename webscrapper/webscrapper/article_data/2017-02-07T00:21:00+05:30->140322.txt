MADURAI: A huge   statue, estimated to be about 400 years old, has been unearthed from the   river in   district. 

 A group of people who had ventured into the dry riverbed at Muthalankurichi village near Seithunganallur on Saturday had noticed a huge carved stone buried in sand. As it looked like part of a  , they informed the former panchayat vice-president Natarajan. An earthmover was employed to unearth the Nandi statue, a common fixture found in Shiva temples.
 
 Local residents immediately started making preparation to worship the statue, which they believed would bring them luck. It was placed at the village square and was adorned with flower garlands.
 
 The stone statue is estimated to weigh around one ton, Natarajan told TOI. “It is intricately carved. The bull is in a lying position with its legs bent inward. It must have been sculptured to be installed at the Veerapandeeswarar Temple in the village. A huge Ganesha statue at the temple carry many of the features of the unearthed statue. Looks like both of them were made by the same sculptor,” he said.
 
 As the ears and nose of the unearthed statue has been damaged, there is a possibility of it being abandoned, Natarajan said. “The elders of the village used to speak about a big flood that swept through the region about 400 years ago. Many huts and statutes at the temple were washed away. Ten years ago, when sand was taken from this part of the river, a section of a similar statue was revealed. But as there was heavy flow, it was forgotten soon,” he said and demanded that the   should inspect the statue.
