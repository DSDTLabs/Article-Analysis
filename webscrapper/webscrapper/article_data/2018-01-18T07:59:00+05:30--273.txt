Ludhiana: Three motorcycle-borne men robbed three traders of Rs 5.50 lakh near Nimm Wala chowk. The traders had returned from Rajasthan after collecting payments from clients.

 In his complaint to police, Mohammad Hussain claimed he and his three friends used to sell shawls and visited different states for trading.
 
 On Tuesday, they returned from Rajasthan with Rs 5.50 lakh kept in a bag. After they landed in Ludhiana, they hired an auto-rickshaw to go to Nimm Wala Chowk where they lived in a rented accommodation.
 
 He alleged that as soon as the auto-rickshaw dropped him near the chowk, motorcycle-borne men came to the spot, pointed sharp-edged weapons towards them and snatched their bag of cash. The trio did not put up any resistance out of fear.
 
 Hussain alleged that they had no money to pay for the fare to the auto driver. However while fleeing, the accused handed the auto driver Rs 200 and thanked him for bringing the traders there, he added.
 
 ASI Gurcharan Singh, investigating officer from Division no 3 police station, said the complainants approached the police on late Tuesday evening. A case under Sections 379-B (snatching) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of IPC has been registered against unidentified accused.
 
 The police are verifying the matter and scanning the CCTV cameras installed in the locality.
 
 The official said the role of auto driver will also be verified during the investigation.
