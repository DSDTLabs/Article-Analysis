In a hilarious gag,   revealed that his on-screen alter ego   had received a rejection letter from the Avengers when he had written to   six years ago requesting a place in the army of Marvel superheroes. 
 
 The 41-year-old actor congratulated the team of 'Avengers: Infinity War' on Instagram after the bumper box office run of the movie in its opening weekend. Known for his classic dead-pan humour, Reynolds shared a photograph of a letter dated April 14, 2012 that he received from Stark Industries - headed by Tony Stark aka Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr in the films. 
 
 The rejection letter carried the subject line: 'Re: Joining the Avengers' with a signature sarcastic reply signed by Tony that read, "No. Absolutely not. Go. Bother Prof X. No." 
 
 Reynolds captioned the picture: "From a guy who never knows when to quit, I'm glad you guys never did. Congrats #Avengers." 
 
  
  
 Chris Hemsworth, who stars as Thor in the Avengers films, commented on the picture, "Thank you mate!"  , which is also a Marvel Comics Universe property, is slated to be released on May 18. 
 
 Reynolds' character, an antihero mutant, has till now been confined to Fox's   based franchise due to licensing issues. Things may take a turn with Disney's recent deal to acquire Fox's assets. R
