NAGPUR: State-run   has blacklisted a   electricity   for supplying 10 lakh substandard meters.   has been blacklisted for a period of three years. 

 However, the discom has already suffered a huge loss due to malfunctioning of these meters.
 
 The letter issued by MSEDCL to Rolex states that the single phase radio frequency meters initially behaved normally but after six months their performance started deteriorating. It stops or slows down when the electricity usage by the consumer is less. 
 
 This caused the meter to record consumption than actual and consequently the   was of lower amount. Naturally, MSEDCL has suffered a huge revenue loss and this loss will continue until the meters are replaced.
 
 As per the contract, the meters are under a guarantee period for a period of five years from the date of commissioning or for five and a half years from the date of dispatch, whichever is earlier. 
 
 MSEDCL had earlier issued a show cause notice to the company seeking explanation for the malfunctioning of the meters. 
 
 However, the reply was not found to be satisfactory and hence the discom officials decided to blacklist the company. 
 
 A MSEDCL official told TOI that the discom would now replace the meters as otherwise low readings would continue to cause losses to the company.
