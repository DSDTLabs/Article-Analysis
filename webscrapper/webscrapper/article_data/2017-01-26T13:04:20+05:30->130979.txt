VADODARA: Days after recording lowest temperature in state, Barodians had to put up with sweltering heat as the maximum temperature in the city soared to 35.1 Celsius on Tuesday, the hottest day of January since 2007.

 The maximum temperature of the city was 5.5 degrees higher than the normal temperature. The highest temperature in the city had surpassed the previous highest of 35 degrees last year. Mercury soared to above 33 degree Celsius in over 12 towns of the state. Surat was hottest in the state at 36 degree Celsius on Tuesday.
 
 Weather officials said that the sudden rise in temperature in most places in the state was due to the wind direction wherein easterly-south easterly winds are blowing over the state. These bring moisture as well as lead to rise in temperature.
 
 Vadodara is expected to have stray clouds with the day temperature declining slightly on Wednesday even as no significant change is expected in the night temperatures. The temperature may go down further from Thursday. 
 
 "There is a western disturbance induced cyclonic circulation lying over central Pakistan and adjoining areas. Under the influence of this induced cyclonic circulation, cloudy sky and some very light rains are expected over   and north   in the next two days", said   director Jayanta Sarkar.
 
 Once the western disturbance passes away, the night temperature is expected to fall on January 27 night. “There will be a perceptible reduction in the night temperature on Friday night”, weather officials said.
