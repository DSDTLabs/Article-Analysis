KOCHI: The two-day nationwide strike by public-sector   employees has disrupted college   procedures .

 Parents and students were unable to pay college fees via challan as over 5,200 banks in the state remained closed.
 
 Despite replenishing the ATMs, widespread panic among people resulted in the machines running dry. This in turn caused difficulties as people were unable to withdraw large sums of money.
 
 “I visited three banks to pay my daughter’s fees via challan but to no avail. Eventually, I had to go to a bank in a remote area,” said a parent working at a private firm.
 
 Meanwhile, striking employees believe that people had been spared from further inconvenience.
 
 “The strike was not combined with the weekend. People would be able to visit banks on Friday and Saturday. Moreover, a 14-day prior notice had been given to the public. Therefore, people have not been affected much. The strike was essential and turned out to be a total success,” said C D  , state convener of United Forum of Bank Unions.
