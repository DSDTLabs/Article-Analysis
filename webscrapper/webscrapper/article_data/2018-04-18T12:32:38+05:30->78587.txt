TIRUPUR: A 62-year-old woman allegedly strangulated her 34-year-old stepdaughter, who had been suffering from learning difficulties, and committed suicide by hanging at their house at Thottathupalayam near Sirupooluvapatti here on the early hours of Tuesday.

 The deceased were identified as Rukmani alias Omana, second wife of Sethu of Wadakkancherry in Thrissur in Kerala, and her stepdaughter Bijimol. The incident took place when Sethu was away in his native place.
 
 Police suspect that Rukmani might have taken the extreme step as she was upset with her stepdaughter’s health condition.
 
 Sethu, an investigation officer said, migrated to   more than two decades ago. “In his first wife Sasi, he has two sons and a daughter (Bijimol). Sasi was pained at the health condition of her daughter and killed herself,” the officer said.
 
 Sethu subsequently married his relative Rukmani, who along with him brought up the three children. While his sons Saju and Sathish got married and moved away, Bijimol was staying with the couple at Thottathupalayam, the officer said
 
 On the eve of Vishu, Sethu along with his sons’ families left for Wadakkancherry, while Rukmani and Bijimol stayed back at the house.
 
 When the duo didn’t come of the house on Tuesday morning, neighbours grew suspicious and peeped through the window, only to find Rukmani hanging from the ceiling of her room. They immediately alerted the Anupparpalayam police, who broke open the front door and found the bodies of Rukmani and Bijimol.
 
 “Rukmani could have strangulated Bijimol to death before hanging herself,” the investigation officer said. During the inquiry, neighbours told the police that Rukmani often used to express her helplessness over the health of her stepdaughter, who could not do anything her own.
 
 The police have registered a case and further investigations are on.
