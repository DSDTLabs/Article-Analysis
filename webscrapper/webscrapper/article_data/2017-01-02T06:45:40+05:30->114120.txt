NASHIK: Over 1,400 doctors from across the city and the district will participate in the mega   Maha Arogya Shibir, which will be held at the   on Sunday as part of new year celebrations.

 Apart from the local doctors, 122 world renowned experts and 22 cancer specialists from Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital, Mumbai will also take part in the health camp. 
 
 Rameshwar Naik, a Nashik zilla parishad official said, “Until Saturday, we received over 30,000 registrations from the primary health centre level. The figures will rise as the patients screened at rural hospitals, city and private hospitals will also be added to it.” 
 
 The current population of the district is around 65 lakh. Of which, around 12 lakh have an annual income lesser than Rs 1 lakh, making them eligible for different government schemes. As many middle-class families have also been found neglecting their health, the health camp is a saviour for them. 
 
 “Providing medical services to a range of people puts immense pressure on the government health services. So, it was decided to organise the camp with the support of expert doctors and non-government organisations. The health camp is also organised on the occasion of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s birthday,” Naik said. 
 
 Screening of patients began at the primary health centre level on December 25. Political party activists at the village level have taken the responsibility to bring the patients to the Golf Ground on Sunday.
 
 “Patients will be treated on-the-spot and surgeries will be performed on those who are in need of the same under the   Scheme. The dates for surgeries will be decided by the doctors,” Naik added. 
 
 The mega health camp is the brain child of district guardian minister  , officials said.
