Tirunelveli: Edward Savarimuthu of Krishnapuram in Palayamkottai, Tirunelveli City, attempted self-immolation in a Tirunelveli court on Monday as he was upset over delay in getting justice in a cheque bounce case. Sources said that Edward Savarimuthu was from Manur in rural Tirunelveli and is now residing at Krishnapuram.

 In 2010, he lent Rs 1 lakh to Dasan of Vallioor in the district. It is learnt that in 2011 Dasan gave a cheque for Rs 1 lakh to Edward but it bounced when the latter deposited it in the bank. The same year Edward lodged a complaint before the Judicial Magistrate-IV in Tirunelveli. The case is pending trial since then.
 
 Meanwhile, Dasan is said to have repaid Rs 59,000 to Edward. On the other hand, the case was adjourned on many occasions. About six months ago, Dasan died, but the case was being adjourned. On Monday too the case was adjourned by judicial magistrate-IV K S Malathi and this upset Edward.
 
 In an unexpected twist, the petitioner who had brought kerosene hidden in a milk packet (tied to his hip) opened the sachet, doused himself and tried to set himself ablaze. Advocate Lakshmanan and a few other who were in the court hall stopped him and handed him over to the police, who escorted him from the court and poured water on him. A case has been registered against Edward for attempted self immolation at the court premises.
