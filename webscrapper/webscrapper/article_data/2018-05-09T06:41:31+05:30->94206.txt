KOLKATA: Probing into the allegations levelled against cricketer   by his wife  , detective department officers — who’ve travelled to Amroha for the second time — have recorded the statements of three of his family members— mother Anjum Ara, sister-in-law Shama Parveen and sister Shabana Anjum.

 “We have recorded the statements of all the persons named by Jahan in the FIR. The police team did not meet these women at their residence. The questioning was arranged by the local district police in one of their offices,” said an officer.
  
  
 
 In another significant development, police have recorded the statements of three persons residing at Bidoli in Amroha who had vouched that Jahan was indeed present at Amroha when the alleged incident of rape took place.
 
 
 “The three witnesses have been identified as Md Shakir Pasha, Md Hasnan and Md Imran. The cops will now compare the statements of the witnesses and the accused before making the next move. Our team is expected to be back in the city soon. Based on their inputs, we will decide if anyone else needs to be questioned,” said an investigating officer.
 
 
 The statements of Shami’s close relatives came weeks after Shami’s brother Haseeb Ahmed has claimed that his brother was at the family farmhouse on the day the alleged rape was committed. Ahmed, the elder brother of the cricketer, has also claimed that he himself was innocent as he was away at Moradabad on work on the same day. The cops will now check mobile tower locations of all members of Shami’s family.
