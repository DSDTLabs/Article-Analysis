Doing your bit for the society needn’t always be something big. Each one of us has the ability to usher in change in our own little ways. It’s this thought that Shaan’s latest single, 'Vaishnav Jan To', which releases today on  , aims to spread.

 With the core message of ‘Gifting Happiness’,   has collaborated with four young singers of  , thus taking forward the company’s (founded by his wife  ) idea of promoting upcoming talent in music.
 
 Talking about the song Shaan says, “Known to be Gandhiji’s favourite, the dialect of this Gujarati bhajan dates back to the 15th century and is rather difficult. However, its philosophy is relevant even today and that’s what prompted me to give it a contemporary touch by adding new lyrics and music.” 
 
 The video features common people, who in their own unique way, are laying the foundation for a better society without the help of NGOs. Shaan elaborates, “There is a woman from   who wears a helmet the whole day to spread awareness about the importance of wearing one. 
 
 There’s also a man who hands over teenage eve-teasers to the cops, because he believes that these youngsters, if not reprimanded in time, might commit rapes as adults. There are many such ‘Vaishnav jans’ in Mumbai.”
