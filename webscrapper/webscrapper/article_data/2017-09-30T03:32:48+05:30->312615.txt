NEW DELHI: Taking Indian flyers a step closer to the government’s almost two-year-old promise of allowing on-board internet, the   ( ) on Friday issued a consultation paper on In-Flight Connectivity (IFC) to frame rules for the same.

 The regulator is examining whether on-board internet should be allowed to flyers from the moment they board aircraft to when they alight, or when the aircraft has reached an altitude of 3 km. And finally, whether Indian flyers should have access to both internet services and mobile communication services.
 
 Since the telecom regulator has sought public comments latest by November 3, sources say Wi-Fi in   could be rolled out by the year-end after getting security clearances as the aviation ministry is already on board and has been waiting for this to happen for a long time now.
 
 “Given the rapidly expanding demand for IFC, there is a proposal to introduce (it) for voice, data and video services over Indian airspace for domestic, international and overflying flights in Indian airspace.
 
  (DoT), through its reference dated August 10, 2017, has requested Trai to furnish its recommendations on licensing terms and conditions for provision of IFC for voice, data and video services and associated issues such as entry fee, licence fee, spectrum-related issues including usage charges and method of allocation,” the Trai paper says.
 
 The aviation ministry had last August promised that Internet in Indian skies would be allowed “in days” but security considerations have held up the same till now.
