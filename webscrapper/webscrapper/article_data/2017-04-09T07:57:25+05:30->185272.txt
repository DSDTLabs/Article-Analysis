NEW DELHI: Terming it an illegal act, the Delhi high   has quashed a municipal corporation’s rehabilitation scheme under which it failed to differentiate between tenants and owners while granting compensation for demolition of shops.

  wondered how the north corporation could put tenants of demolished shops at par with the owners by giving both of them 50% share in the relocated land.
 
 Justice   observed in her recent   that converting a tenant’s status to that of a landlord is against all the statutes dealing with such a relationship, and “all principles of equity, fair play and natural justice.”
 
 HC’s comments came while setting aside a resolution of the north corporation by which it devised the rehabilitation scheme to give alternative land to the owners and tenants of 121 shops at   in north Delhi.
 
 The shops, which were leased out on a perpetual lease for 99 years, were demolished in 2009 for a road-widening project. Only nine of the 121 shops were occupied by tenants and the owners of four such shops had challenged the rehabilitation scheme of 2014. Allowing the plea of the owners, the court said, “By way of this resolution a man who was owning one complete piece of land had suddenly been reduced in his ownership to a status of 50%. By the present resolution, the corporation has taken away all the rights of the petitioners.”
 
 “The petitioners who were the owners… have suddenly been reduced to a half ownership status. This was no fault on their part. This resolution, if allowed to be implemented, would cause a grave prejudice. It would be a serious detriment to the rights of such petitioners,” the court added. It noted that the corporation had taken the same decision in 2009 when it had come out with a rehabilitation scheme subsequent to the demolition, but the high court had in 2012 set it aside and asked the civic body to consider it afresh.
