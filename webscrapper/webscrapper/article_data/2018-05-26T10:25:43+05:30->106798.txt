PUNE:   will take   to court if the latter stopped the   supply to the transport body over non-payment of dues.

 Sharing this information with TOI, PMPML chairperson and managing director   said on Friday that   (MNGL) will be paid as and when the funds arrive. “Legal action will be sought against MNGL if the gas supply is discontinued,” she added.
 
 Last week, MNGL officials had said Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) owed Rs 25 crore to the gas distribution company. “MNGL will stop the supply if the transport body doesn’t clear the dues as soon as possible,” they had added.
 
 Gunde said, “I have checked the issue with the accounts department and we paid them Rs 10 crore recently. The rest of the money will be paid to them as and when the funds arrive.”
 
 An MNGL official said the PMPML is yet to communicate to them about fresh payments. “If PMPML does not pay by Monday, we will hold a meeting on Tuesday to decide on the gas supply,” he added.
 
 Citizens’ group PMP Pravasi Manch supported PMPML’s plan to take legal action. “I hope that it has a plan ready to deal with the situation,”  , secretary of Manch, said.
