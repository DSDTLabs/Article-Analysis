NEW DELHI: In a fresh turn to the EC-Congress tiff over organisational polls, the   has asked the party to send a copy of the resolution of the   which postponed the internal elections by one year to December 2017.

 Congress has sent the resolution to the poll watchdog amid a growing view that the latter may be softening its stance after red-flagging the extension sought by the party. An EC spokesperson said the poll panel has not taken any decision after the receipt of the copy of the resolution. It received the copy only on Monday, he said.
 
 On January 5, the EC refused to grant the one-year grace period sought by Congress, asking the party to wind up the process by June.
 
 In its angry response on February 3,   argued that the party constitution empowers the CWC to decide on organisational polls and the latter had passed a resolution last year deferring it to end-2017. Congress argued that the EC’s jurisdiction was limited to supervising if the party was following its constitution, taking exception to its order that   finish the polls by mid-2017.
 
 The poll panel appeared miffed at Congress’s request for a second deferment after it had already secured an extra year in 2015. The fresh request means a delay in party polls by two years.
 
 Now, with the EC seeking a copy of the CWC resolution for perusal following the Congress protest, it is felt that the poll body may be softening its stance. Besides questioning the EC’s jurisdiction, Congress had also stated that its workers and resources were engaged in campaigning for assembly elections and the party could not redirect them to hold internal polls by June.
