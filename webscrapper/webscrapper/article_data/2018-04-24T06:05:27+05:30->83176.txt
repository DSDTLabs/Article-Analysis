KOLKATA: Last December, 13-year-old   from Baisakhi Housing Estate died of dengue — the only casualty of the disease in proper Salt Lake. Several others in the housing complex, which is very close to   canal, had also suffered from the disease. Keeping this in mind, the urban development and municipal affairs department, the custodian of Baisakhi Housing Estate, has decided to take action from now to prevent a recurrence.

 The authorities plan to regularly spray mosquito repellent oils and bleaching powder on the complex premises. Mosquito repellent oils will be sprayed five days a week and bleaching powder will be sprinkled at least once a week in all the corners. The work will be carried out by trained labourers after evening and in such a way that the residents do not feel any breathing trouble.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 The housing estate is located very close to Kestopur and Prafulla Kanan, the two worst dengue-affected areas last year. The residents of the housing complex had complained that the authorities had taken no action for years to either clean up the premises, and neither did they take initiatives to carry out vector-borne disease control measures. There had been no proper maintenance of the complex for years, they had alleged.
 
 Local councillor   said it would be good if the government appointed contractors to do their job properly and spray larvicide and bleaching powder inside Baisakhi housing estate. “The housing estate needs to be properly cleaned. We from the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation’s side will be doing whatever necessary to keep mosquitoes at bay,” she said.
