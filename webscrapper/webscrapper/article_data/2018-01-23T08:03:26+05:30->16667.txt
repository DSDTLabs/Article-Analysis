KOLKATA: Punjab notched up their second successive victory in Super League stage of the   with a robust chase to take pole position in Group A. After edging Karnataka via One-Over Eliminator on Sunday, Punjab paced their chase to near perfection to leave Mumbai licking their wounds at Jadavpur University’s Salt Lake campus ground on Monday.

 
 Set a daunting 199-run victory target, Punjab owed their three-wicket win to opener   (42),   (43) and a rather uncharacteristic 40 (34 balls) by   while the finishing touches were provided by Sharad Lumba (21 off 10).
 
 Vohra and his opening partner Mandeep Singh (20) pulverised Mumbai’s attack to garner 42 runs in just 20 balls to set the tone of the chase. After Mandeep’s dismissal, skipper Harbhajan Singh once again promoted himself and hit a couple of cracking boundaries to make sure there was not let-up in the tempo.
 
 Harbhajan’s casual approach led to his run-out, yet Punjab had 70 runs on the board at the end of the Powerplay. Yuvraj struggled with his timing and was dropped at long-off by Akhil Herwadkar off Sagar Trivedi when he was on eight, but two sweetly-timed sixes signalled his intent.
 
 Yuvraj’s third-wicket association with Vohra yielded 35 runs as the 100 of the innings was raised in 9.3 overs. Vohra’s dismissal and Yuvraj’s loss of bearings slowed things down. Jay Bista and Shivam Dube brought Mumbai back in the match with their clever variations in line and length.
 
 Just 21 runs came off the next four overs and at 125/3 after 14 overs, Punjab were well behind the asking rate. Yuvraj enjoyed another let-off during this period as Shreyas Iyer spilled a sitter off Bista at long-off when the batsman was on 32.
 
 However, all the good work done by Bista and Dube was undone by Akash Parkar in the 15th over as Gurkeerat smacked him for two sixes and three boundaries (4, 6, 4, 0, 6, 4). His 18-ball 43, which also included two excellent reverse-swept boundaries, swung the match back in Punjab’s favour.
 
 A top-edge off Bista led to Gurkeerat’s dismissal, leaving Punjab to get 42 off 28 balls. Dube put a spanner in the works by trapping Yuvraj plumb in front of the stumps. But Mumbai’s faint hopes were snuffed by Lumba, who settled the issue with two sixes and a boundary.
 
 Earlier, Mumbai rode a brilliant unbeaten 79 off 44 balls from Iyer to post 198/4 after being asked to bat first. Iyer, who was dropped on 49 by Gurkeerat off Baltej Singh, hit eight boundaries and four sixes while sharing fruitful stands - 73 runs with Herwadkar (42) and 46 with Dube (22).
 
 
 
 Suresh Raina roared back to form with an unbeaten century in Uttar Pradesh's 75-run win even as Bengal and Jharkhand stood on the brink of exit.
 
 
  Mumbai 198/4 in 20 overs (A Herwadkar 42, S Iyer 79*). Punjab 199/7 in 19.2 ovs (M Vohra 42, Yuvraj 40, Gurkeerat 43; S Dube 3/27).
