PATNA:   Awadhesh Narayan Singh’s sons   and Sushant Ranjan are evading arrest after a local court issued arrest warrant under non-bailable section against them for allegedly thrashing a girl after holding her captive at Singh’s official bungalow on May 16. The victim, said to be a flight attendant, had lodged an FIR with the Women’s police station on May 19 against the Singh’s sons. 

 “The medical examination confirmed injury on her hand,” City SP (central) D Amarkesh said on Friday. Both were evading arrest, he said and added the Women’s police station was handling the case and no special investigation team (SIT) was formed to arrest the duo. Sources said the two went underground soon after the FIR was lodged against them.
 
 Sources said the victim on Friday got her statement recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of CrPC. “We are yet to get a copy of the statement from the court,” a police officer said. 
 
 The court had issued arrest warrant under Sections 354B (assault or use of criminal force on woman with intent to disrobe), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). Section 354B is non-bailable.
