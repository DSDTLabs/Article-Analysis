On the complaint of Kochi Mayor  , filmmaker   Joseph was recently arrested, and later released on bail, for allegedly insulting the modesty of a woman and abusing her.

 The director wrote on his social media page that the Mayor took the action against him for trying to get permission to shoot in Subhash Park, Kochi. In the long post uploaded today, he says, "All I wanted to do was to make an awareness film about pedophilia, for kids, which could be screened in schools. I too have a baby, and I felt it's my responsibility. Nivin Pauly also agreed to team up with me on it." Minister P K Sreemathi and MLA Hibi Eden had also apparently expressed their support for the project. The director says that however, the Mayor wasn't ready to give the permission. "I told her that it's sad that she isn't giving her consent for a cause with such a good intention, and that I will react against it."
 
 Apparently, Soumini Jain was miffed with this and also wanted Jude to conduct a press meet and apologise to her, which he agreed to do once the shoot of the short film is over. Jude says that the incident has saddened his friends and family, and he wouldn't spend time for social service, anymore. However, his followers on social forums have been urging him to forget the bitter experience and keep up with the good work. The short film's shoot was over on April 5 on another location.
