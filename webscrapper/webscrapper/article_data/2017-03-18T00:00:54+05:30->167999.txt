Jaipur: The Jhunjhunu police on Friday arrested a 23-year-old man for allegedly raping her seven-year-old niece near a slum on Thursday night.

 The accused has been identified as Shehzad, who lived near the girl‘s house and raped her on Thursday evening.
 
 “When the toddler returned home she was bleeding from her private parts. She identified her uncle and he has been arrested by us,” police official said.
 
 Meanwhile, the toddler has been brought to Jaipur’s JK Lon Hospital for further treatment where her condition is stated to be out of danger.
 
 Manan Chaturvedi, chairperson of Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Right, visited the toddler at the hospital and to take stock of the situation.
 
 “The girl’s family is very poor and they don’t have many resources at their disposal hence, they needs some help which we have provided to them, Chaturvedi said, adding that girl is responding well to the treatment.
 
 “As of now her condition is out of danger, but the girl’s family would still need some assistance once they go back to their house. We have asked them not to worry about anything and reach out to us for help,” she said.
 
 Meanwhile, the police said that they have already arrested the accused and have booked him under several sections of the IPC and POCSO act.
