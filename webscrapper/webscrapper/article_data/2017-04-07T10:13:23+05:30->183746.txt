PUNE: Nagrik Chetana Manch ( ) has alleged that the civic body is encouraging non-segregation of garbage to benefit contractors running processing units. 

 Maj Gen SCN Jatar (retd) of NCM, in a letter to mayor  , alleged the civic body claims that over 60% garbage is segregated in the city, but the fact is different. " The   (PMC) is encouraging non-segregation of garbage, which is given to contractors for processing. Weight of mixed garbage is more than that of segregated garbage and it benefits the contractors, who charge the civic body Rs 300 to process per tonne of garbage," the letter said.
 
 The NCM also claimed, almost all processing units in the city are either shut down or are flouting rules. "The surrounding areas suffer because of the foul smell emanating from the processing units. The Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 insists on buffer zone around garbage processing plants. The PMC and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board must finalize buffer zones for the city's processing plants," stated the NCM letter.
 
 Jatar said, a processing unit in  , which is given Rs 360 per tonne garbage, was flouting rules and remained unchecked. " The PMC must remember that public health is more important than financial gains of a private processing company. The civic body must act immediately and take stringent action to ensure that garbage is segregated and processed as per norms," Jatar added. 
 
 PMC's solid waste department head Suresh Jagtap said, the civic body is trying to ensure 100% waste segregation and will set up more processing plants. Jagtap added that the civic body also plans to set up small units across the city.
