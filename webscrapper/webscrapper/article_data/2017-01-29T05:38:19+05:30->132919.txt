CHENNAI: While scientists keep making discoveries and new findings, science communication in the country at many times is rather poor, said agricultural scientist   on Saturday.

 Delivering Dr   Jr Memorial Lecture organised by   and  , he said that scientists should let the people know about the implications and benefits of their work to allay their fear.
 
 “Eminent scientists should explain their work, its consequences, the benefits and the risks. There has to be more and more science communication,” he said. Professor Swamination recalled how a few activists destroyed the golden rice crop, a genetically engineered crop, as there was a fear that it would replace the existing biodiversity.
 
 Focusing his lecture on the title ‘We Shall Overcome’, Swaminathan said that the urgent need in the country is now to overcome the hidden hunger, which is in the form of   including iron, iodine and zinc. But for a hunger free India, equal attention has to be given to other two aspects- calorie deprivation and protein deficiency.
 
 “While the country has overcome hunger in a broader sense, we are yet to overcome malnutrition among women and children, and spread awareness about climate change,” he said.
 
 Swaminathan went on to explain the role of biofortification in achieving the zero hunger challenge launched by former UN secretary general. He suggested three major approaches of biofortification to eradicate hunger that is use of naturally occurring biofortified plants like moringa, sweet potato, nutria-millets and fruits and vegetables, biofortified varieties including breeding and selection like iron-rich pearl millet and genetically biofortified crops like golden rice. “Using naturally occurring biofortified plants is one way to overcome micronutrient deficiency,” he said.
