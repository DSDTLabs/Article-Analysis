KOLHAPUR: The Shiv Sena’s impressive win in the 2014   has not yet made significant inroads at the local level. 

 Seven of the 10 MLAs from Kolhapur district are from Shiv Sena. Party workers are planning to use the influence of the MLAs and their groups to show their presence in the upcoming Kolhapur zilla parishad elections. 
 
 There are a total of 67 seats in Kolhapur ZP. Of these, 29 seats are from the three talukas of Karveer, Hatkanangle and Shirol. Sena has strong presence in Hatkanangle and Karveer talukas as two of its MLAs are from these constituencies. Sena leaders are now focusing the election campaign on these talukas with an aim to win maximum seats.
 
 “We have six MLAs in the district and all are working together with an aim to win maximum seats from their respective constituencies. These leaders also want to strengthen their base in the local politics and increase their presence in every assembly segment. This will ultimately benefit the party to increase its base at grass-roots level in the villages in the Kolhapur district,” said a senior Shiv Sena leader.
 
 In the 2012 elections, the Sena had won four seats and was in the opposition. The Shiv Sena had then formed an alliance with the Nationalist   (NCP). During this election, the party is planning out a strategy to win sizeable seats that will have influence over the politics of the local body. 
 
 The BJP continues to draw bigwigs from other parties, helping the party strengthen its base at the local level. The Congress and the NCP are trying to avoid tussle between the existing members and probable candidates. 
 
 BJP has already initiated drive to rope in persons having elective merit to strengthen party’s base in local level politics. Congress and NCP are discussing to form alliances at some places depending upon the local level implications.
