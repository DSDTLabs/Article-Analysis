CHENNAI: Summer is round the corner, and the combined storage in the four   providing water to the city remains below 15% of the capacity. Waking up to the challenge of water scarcity, the government has decided to tap 12 water bodies in and around Chennai.

 These erstwhile irrigation tanks would be desilted to hold 750 million cubic feet (0.75 TMC) of water, equivalent of three weeks' supply to the city, revenue administration commissioner K Satyagopal told a seminar on Tuesday. “The concept is that most of the local bodies have irrigation tanks that are not tapped after urbanisation. These tanks will be desilted below the sill level. We are also taking disaster mitigation measures in a big way to ensure that the state becomes drought-proof ,“ he said.
 
 “A similar exercise has been taken up across the state in  . Subsurface dikes are also being constructed close to drinking water sources and river courses to improve the groundwater system,“ Satyagopal added.
 
 The state government, meanwhile, is working on   to be formed at the district level to conserve and tap water during summer. Government officials who reviewed the water situation across the state said drought-like situation has been pre vailing in many villages, with rivers like Tamaraparani and Vaigai virtually drying up. “We are getting prepared for the worst, but we hope we will get some showers this summer, as predicted by the  ,“ Satyagopal said.
