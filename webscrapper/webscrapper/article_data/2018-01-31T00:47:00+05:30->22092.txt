Madurai: M K Alagiri’s supporters requested him to come back into active politics Tuesday at a function organised to celebrate his birthday in Madurai. Speaking at his 67th birthday function, which was a low key affair in the city, his supporters requested him to come back into politics. Even Satya Sai Nagar where Alagiri’s residence is located wore a deserted look as Alagiri himself did not participate in any public events.

 Unlike the yesteryears, when the city was decked up to celebrate his birthday, bringing traffic to a standstill on important routes, there was nothing except a few posters and banners to mark the day.
 
 Events were held in many parts of the city, where sweets were distributed to the locals. On New jail road, former west zone chairman R M P Chinnan, distributed sweets to over 3,000 people. Many DMK functionaries participated in the event.
 
 Madurai Flower market celebrated Alagiri’s birthday with Meenakshi Flower Market president S Ramachandran presiding over the function. Former deputy mayor P M Mannan participated in event and said that they hoped that Alagiri would come into active politics again. Biriyani was distributed to the people at the market and vendors.
