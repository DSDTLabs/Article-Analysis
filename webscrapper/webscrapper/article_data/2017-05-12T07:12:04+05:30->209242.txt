MUMBAI: In a setback to  , the Bombay high court held that time spent in custody as an undertrial in a case under the   ( ) cannot be set off against the 10 year sentence he was given last year for arms possession in a 2003 blasts case.

 A special court last April convicted Nachan to 10 years' rigorous imprisonment for arms possession under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) in the Mulund, Vile Parle and   blasts.
 
 He was arrested on April 10, 2003, and was in custody for seven years, 10 months and 22 days till March 1, 2011. While on bail, he was arrested on August 4, 2012, under MCOCA for the attempted murder of a VHP activist. The trial is yet to begin. He was released on bail last October after six months and 24 days as an undertrial prisoner.
 
 Through his lawyer Sudeep Pasbola, he pleaded that since he was an undertrial prisoner in the MCOCA case when produced before the POTA court in the 2003 case, the period of detention undergone as an undertrial in the MCOCA case should be included in the set-off for his 10 year sentence in the Mulund-Vile Parle-Mumbai Central blasts.
 
 Special public prosecutor Rohini Salian said though the custodies overlapped, time spent behind bars for one case cannot be used as a set-off in a separate one. Time spent as an undertrial in the 2012 MCOCA case can be used to set off any sentence if he is convicted in that case alone.
 
 Salian said Nachan has to serve another year and two months to complete his sentence. If he fails to pay the Rs 1.3 lakh fine, he'll be behind bars for another year in default.
