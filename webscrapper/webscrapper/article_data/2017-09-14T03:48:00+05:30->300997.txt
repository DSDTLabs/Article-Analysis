Margao: In a bid to shore up its revenue, Margao municipal council ( ) has decided to introduce a single window system for a limited period of one month for issuing trade licences and house tax to traders coming under its jurisdiction and who have, so far, managed to remain outside the tax ambit.

 Addressing reporters on Wednesday, chairperson, MMC, Babita Angle Prabhudessai, in the presence of chief officer, Agnelo Fernandes, said that a dedicated counter for the purpose will begin functioning from September 18 and will remain in operation for a month. 
 
 Notices, in that regard, have already been published in local newspapers, MMC stated. “Traders applying for trade licences during the one month single window period will be issued the licenses with minimum documentation and least hassles. This is an endeavour of the municipality to collect revenue and also to help traders get trade licences with much ease,” Prabhudessai told reporters.
 
 “This is an opportunity for traders to obtain the trade licences as they won’t be asked to pay up the arrears towards trade tax for the period they were plying the trade illegally,” Prabhudessai said.
 
 Replying to a query, Prabhudessai said that revenue of at least Rs 1crore would be added to the municipality’s coffers during the month-long single window trade licence facility.
 
 MMC will crack down against illegal traders, including those operating their units without trade licences, upon the closure of the dedicated counter for trade tax, Prabhudessai said. She also disclosed that the MMC was mulling outsourcing the task of revenue recovery to a private agency, the modalities of which, she said, were yet to be worked out.
