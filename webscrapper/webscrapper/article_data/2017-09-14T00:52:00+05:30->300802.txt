Coimbatore: While the producing capacity of a new jasmine variety is already being proved at multi-locational trials, the flower’s scent is yet to be tested. Scientists say the flowers can be tested only once the plants are a year old. They say they are in the process of studying the different compounds in the new variety and it is likely to be completed in six months. 

 Scientists at TNAU said they are in the process of “aroma profiling” the new variety. “We have found the flowers to be highly fragrant, but its compounds are extremely different from other jasmine varieties like Gundu Malli and Jaadhi Malli,” said associate professor of horticulture, TNAU, M Ganga, who also worked on developing the new variety. “However, the profiling is taking longer than expected because we have not been able to get enough quantity of flowers to perform the tests required,” she said. 
 
 Scientists are likely to use the solvent extraction method followed by the gas chromatography and mass spectography methods to first identify the different compounds in its fragrance and aroma. “Once we identify the different compounds and the ones which are most intense, we might be able to use the electronic nose in future to study the intensity of the fragrance,” said Ganga. 
 
 Jasmine flowers have around 120 components, of which 10 are prominent. The aroma profiling of the improved variety is critical to see if it is possible to extract scents and essential oils on a commercial scale. 
 
 The solvent extraction method, which is done in the laboratory, usually involves use of ethanol as the solvent due to its high availability. The extracts can be compared using the gas chromatography analysis. This method, though more trusted, takes around three hours to give a reading. It is often used to test jasmine essential oils too.
