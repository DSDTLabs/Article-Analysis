NEW DELHI: In   in Delhi,   of those   are friends or   of the  . A   has found this.

 The study has also found that only 3% of rapes are committed by strangers in the city. Data has found that 85% of rape cases in the capital were committed at the house of the victim or the accused and only 5% were committed at hotels or restaurants. Almost 98% of the cases were reported within three days of the crime being committed. 
 
 This year, altogether 487 rape cases were reported of which 76% were solved. 
 
 But there is a feeling that the actual figure could be much higher as cases are often not reported due to the stigma attached to them.
 
  “When the victims know the accused, they hesitate to report the matter to the police even though we urge people to report such crimes in order to prevent them from continuing. However, it remains a challenge for us and the society on how to convince the victims to report it to us,” said Delhi Police chief spokesperson Dependra Pathak. 
 
 According to another set of police data released last year, the 18-25 age group was found to be the most vulnerable. It was also found that most rapes were reported from areas around unauthorised colonies. Almost 70% of the accused were found to be from the city while the rest were migrants, and 95% of them were school dropouts. In 2017, 80% of cases were solved within 24 hours. 
 
 Police identify three major reasons for rape in these areas. They say the youngsters’ exposure to explicit content on the internet through mobile phones is a big reason. Moreover, the growth of colonies on the outskirts has resulted in large extended families staying together in one room leading to more contact, which eventually results in sexual assault. Lastly, the skewed ideas about men and women among youngsters leads to sexual violence. 
 
 Police say rape cases have come down by 1.2% while those involving molestation and ‘outraging modesty’ are down by 19.6% and 31.6% respectively.
