HYDERABAD: With the government announcing that one-minute rule will be followed in the upcoming Senior Secondary Certificate (SSC) exams, scheduled to begin on March 15, the demand for abolishing this rule is growing from all corners. 

 Teachers,  , and activists questioned the need to implement the rule in every exam and said that a student shouldn't be stopped from writing an exam because he or she is late.
 
 "If a student arrives 10 minutes late for an exam, he/she will be the one losing their precious time. The government should not link this with malpractice and treat it like a crime. A candidate might have a genuine reason for arriving late," said Lavanya M, principal of a private school in  .
 
 Child-right activists believe that the government should not threaten students with such rules.
 
 "There is no benefit in implementing this rule. It only increases stress on students. If the government really wants to implement this rule, they should have proper infrastructure and should transport children in special buses," said Achyuta Rao, a child-rights activist. 
 
 He further suggested that the exams should be held in self-centres so to avoid student's travelling to different schools. Parents too demanded the abolishment of this rule and said that one-minute should not change the life of a child.
 
 An estimated 5.60 lakh students, in over 2,500 centres across the state, will appear for the exams this year. Like last year, students appearing for SSC this year will not be given five minutes grace time to appear for exams. The directorate has also decided to use CCTV cameras in 431 centres.
 
 Students can avail free transportation facility on RTC buses by producing their hall ticket.
