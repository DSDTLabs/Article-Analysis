LUDHIANA: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Punjab, has welcomed the Delhi high court’s decision to set aside the Election Commission’s ruling that disqualified 20 MLAs of AAP in Delhi, claiming they were disqualified without being given the opportunity for a proper hearing.

 Welcoming the decision, AAP Punjab’s spokesperson   said the Delhi HC’s decision would be seen as a big blow on the face of the   government and its then chief election commissioner (CEC) A K Joti, who had recommended the case of 20 AAP MLAs for disqualification to the President of India a day before the completion of his term as CEC without giving MLAs an opportunity of hearing, which is otherwise a prerequisite. Shankar said the decision amounted to murder of democracy, as A K Joti, who was especially picked up by Modi for the constitutional post of CEC, acted in an autocratic and unconstitutional way, leaving aside the pleas of affected MLAs for giving them a chance of a hearing. “Joti was Modi’s blue-eyed officer, who had served as his chief secretary in Gujarat,” added Shankar.
 
 It was further added that AAP MLAs had not availed any benefit which could be presumed as office of profit, while many BJP MLAs were continuing as chief parliamentary secretaries in the BJP-ruled states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, and   at the time of the decision.
 
 AAP’s spokesperson slammed the central government for “unnecessarily harassing and creating hurdles” for the Kejriwal government from day one, on one pretext or the other, which was very dangerous for the country’s federal system of governance. He warned that people of the country were seriously watching the behaviour of the BJP-led Union government towards AAP in Delhi, which has been performing with distinction in the field of improvisation of education, health, and other facilities in the country’s capital.” 
 
 “Reacting to the BJP’s dictatorial attitude, people in many states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar had recently given a big jolt to the party by defeating its candidates in the by-elections to Lok Sabha,” added the spokesperson.
