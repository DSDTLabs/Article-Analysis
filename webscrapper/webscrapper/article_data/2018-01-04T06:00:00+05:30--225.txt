Ghazal Srinivas, who was arrested on Tuesday for his alleged involvement in a sexual harassment case, has now been suspended from his post as the honourary brand ambassador of Save Temples, a project run by the US based  . This is the same NGO for which   ran a web radio service. 

 “At our organisation, temples are like our workplaces. And workplaces are like temples. Our organisation respects women, we consider them goddesses. We cannot tolerate anyone doing anything immoral, misusing the name of our organisation. We have taken the decision to suspend   from his post in Save Temples,”  , President of Save Temples, has been quoted as saying.
 
 Meanwhile, the decision on the bail petition for the accused was postponed to Thursday. While the court heard both sides out, the police made a strong pitch to keep the accused in remand for a week more, until investigations are done. The police also said that bail should not be granted as there is compelling evidence against Srinivas and he would threaten the witnesses if he got out. Ghazal Srinivas is facing charges of sexual harassment of a female radio jockey who worked for his spiritual web radio channel, Aalayavani.
