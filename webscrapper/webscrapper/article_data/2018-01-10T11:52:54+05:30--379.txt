 “We had to score more or the same number of points scored by the champions from Kozhikode. If we did not do so, the performance would net no points, those were the rules. The performers from   are good, they have even won prizes at the state-level events. When we went for our appeal we knew that it would be a challenge,” said  , the twelfth grader from St Joseph’s Boys.
 
 He said that they were eliminated last year as well at the district level as AKKR Girls HSS won both district and state events. “No one used to go for Vanchipattu event. We formed a team and went ahead after watching a couple of videos. We got a trainer this year and prepared properly. And that is why we were confident when we made our appeal. We knew we would do well,” said Thejas.
