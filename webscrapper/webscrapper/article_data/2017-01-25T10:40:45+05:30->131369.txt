LUCKNOW: Prominent leaders once again managed to get tickets for their kith and kin even in the third list of 67 candidates declared by the BJP on Tuesday.

 Topping the list was Anurag Singh, the son of former cabinet minister and former UP BJP chief   Singh, for Chunar seat. 
 
 Singh senior was sulking ever since his son Anurag’s candidature for   elections from Mirzapur was rejected and Apna Dal leader Anupriya Patel had contested from that seat. 
 
  sitting MLA Jyotsna Srivastava managed to get a ticket for her son Saurabh. Jyotsna is the wife of former cabinet minister late Harish Chandra Srivastava. Saurabh’s candidature came as a surprise for many, especially in Varanasi, as he had not been as active as other leaders, a BJP insider said. 
 
 Similarly, a ticket has been given to Alka Rai, former MLA and wife of late Krishnanand Rai, from Mohammadabad constituency. 
 
 While Gonda MP Brij Bhusan Sharan Singh managed to get a ticket for his son Prateek from Gonda assembly constituency, former BJP MP Ramakant Yadav and strongman in Azamgarh got a ticket for his son Arun.
 
 Among sitting MPs, Kamlesh Paswan, the Lok Sabha member from Bansgaon (reserved) seat managed to get a ticket for his brother Vimlesh from Bansgaon (reserved) assembly seat. 
 
 Similarly, BJP leader Udaybhan Karvariya, the brother of former BSP MP Kapil Muni Karvariya, managed to get a ticket for his relative Neelam Karvariya.
