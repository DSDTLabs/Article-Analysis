GURUGRAM: The management of a   has agreed to relocate it and part with its land for the construction of the Farrukhnagar-Gurugram bypass, removing a month-long deadlock over the project.

 The managing committee of the gaushala submitted a letter to PWD minister Rao Narbir Singh on Sunday expressing its consent to give the land for the road. The minister had inaugurated the construction of the 2.5km-long road in August 2017, but work was stalled because of resistance from the gaushala committee.
 
 The bypass will link   in   with the Gurugram Road and skirt the residential areas of Farrukhnagar. It is expected to reduce travel time between Gurugram and Jhajjar. Unable to get the land for the construction of the road, the state had a few months ago formed a team headed by the chairman of the Farrukhnagar Market Committee, Virendra  . The committee was tasked with convincing all the parties concerned to cooperate with the government.
 
 “After a series of meetings, we managed to convince the people to allow the construction of the road. The managing committee of the gaushala agreed to take compensation and part with their land,” said Yadav.
 
 Yadav said they had requested the government to ensure the road was completed at the earliest to reduce congestion in Farrukhnagar.
 
 Jagpal Jaildar, the president of the gaushala managing committee, said: two shades and a portion of their office that were coming in the way of the road would be shifted by February.
