 has never been the conventional actress, whether in her looks, voice or acting style. The director of her first film,  , had retained her deep voice for her film and her way of delivering dialogues was as unique as her. Ask her if she is ever conscious of her voice and she says, "'It depends. I was not confident about my voice earlier, but not anymore. I think it's more important for an actor to be convincing rather than use their own voice. If I'm playing an 80-year-old lady I have to sound like one, not a younger person trying to act old. I would love to dub for all my movies but I would first see if I sound convinced."
