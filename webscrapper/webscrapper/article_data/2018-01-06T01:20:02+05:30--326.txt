GURUGRAM: State women’s commission vice-chairperson   has taken suo motu cognisance of a complaint lodged by a Sector 56 resident, who took to Twitter last week and alleged that   had roughed her up in presence of cops at Sector 56 police station during a dispute over monkey catchers in the society.

 A resident of Kendriya Vihar Society, Chetna D Joshi, who describes herself as a freelance fashion stylist and animal lover, had claimed in her tweets that her life was in danger. She had also tagged the CMO, and sought assurance for her safety. 
 
 Bharadwaj met Joshi and RWA members at the police commissioner’s office in Gurgaon on Friday evening. 
 
 Though the row had started due to fight over animal rights, Bharadwaj said she was concerned about the complainant’s safety more than anything else. “I was only interested in addressing the serious allegations levelled against police officers, including the area SHO,” Bharadwaj said, adding that she did not find merits in a number of arguments made by the complainant though.
 
 “I tried to talk to both the parties and resolve the matter. But the complainant didn’t seem interested in her safety, she was only concerned about the animal issue,” she added.
 
 Bharadwaj made certain recommendations to the RWA, like including women members in the residents’ council for addressing such issues. “I have also suggested them to make guidelines for dealing with animals, keeping in mind people’s rights to keep pets,” she said.
