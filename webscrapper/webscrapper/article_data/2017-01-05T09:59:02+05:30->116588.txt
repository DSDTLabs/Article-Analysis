CHENNAI: Two-time champion and world No. 6,   crashed out in the second round on Wednesday to little-known qualifier   7-6, 5-7, 7-5. Two days after fellow Croatian and last year's finalist   crashed out, the doors closed on Cilic.

 Coming off a mixed season last year where he beat   but failed to inspire his country in the Davis Cup finals against Argentina, Chennai Open was the perfect platform to kick start his 2017 campaign before heading Down Under. Chennai was no unknown territory for Cilic having come here seven times, but Kovalik was definitely unknown to him and that helped the unknown Slovak.
 
 “That is always the difficulty playing an unknown player. I have never played him and I have never seen him play. He came through on Tour last year with a few good wins. I think he played extremely well and I wasn't expecting it from him,” Cilic said after the match. Kovalik too said that it helped that Cilic did not know him as a player. “I know him pretty well. I have seen him on V. But he hasn't ever. So he did not what to expect from me and that helped.”
 
 The Slovakian did not look intimated when he stepped out and he seemed more and more confident as the match wore on. Though it seemed that Cilic would turn on his experience during a tiebreak, it was rookie Kovalik who held his nerve.
 
 The tide seemed to turn for Cilic in the second set. But Kovalik was not ready to give up just yet. The Slovak broke the Croat in the 11th game and was soon serving for the match. Something that a 117th ranked player facing the world No.6 probably didn't dream of.
