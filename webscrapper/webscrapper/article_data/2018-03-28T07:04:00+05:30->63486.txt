NOIDA: Congress MP   on Tuesday said she would lodge a   against minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju for “denigrating her status as a woman” in the Surpanakha controversy.

 Rijiju had posted a video of Surpanakha’s loud   on his official Facebook page after Prime Minister   took a dig at Chaudhary’s laughter in Parliament, saying he was hearing such laughter for the first time since the days of watching the serial Ramayana. Rijiju’s post had said, “PM Modiji reminded me of those days of epic Ramayana serial.” It had not mentioned Chowdhury but she said it was meant for her. Earlier, Chowdhary had also moved a privilege motion in the upper House against Rijiju for his post.
 
 Speaking at the inaugural session of an event organised by the Amity law school titled ‘Srijan: A genesis of Indian politics’ on Tuesday, she said that it was unfortunate that in today’s time the Prime Minister was questioning a woman’s laughter. Talking about changes in laws pertaining to women, she rued that even the minister of state for home who was supposed to uphold the law had uploaded a video that was derogatory towards a woman as per IPC sections. “I am filing a case against Kiren Rijiju for denigrating my status as a woman. This is my legal right, whether it’s the MoS (home), the PM or anybody else,” she said.
 
 On February 7, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu had ticked off the MP by telling her to see a doctor for her loud laughter during the PM’s speech in the Upper House. At that point, the PM had made the controversial jibe, followed by thumping of desks by BJP members.
 
 At the event, Chowdhary also suggested a public discussion on the issue of polygamy.
