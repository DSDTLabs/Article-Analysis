PATNA: Makeshift shops selling colours, water guns and masks have come up in almost every nook and corner of the city now that   is just days away.

 Shopkeepers say water guns are in high demand. “Gone are the days when people would play with ‘pichkaris’ made of brass. ‘Pichkaris’ have given way to water guns now,” said Javed, who has opened a makeshift near the Boring Road roundabout.
 
 According to him, the water guns made of plastic are bought by the young and old alike. “These guns are priced in the range of Rs 50 to Rs 1,100, depending on their design and water carrying capacity, which usually varies in the range of 300ml to 1.5 litre,” Javed said.
 
 “The guns with large containers have dual advantage: you don’t need a refill soon and you can fire up to six to seven feet,” said Raj Gupta, a salesman in a supermarket at Bander Bagicha.
 
 Gupta said water gun sales were yet to pick up. “Children are busy with their final exams. They will come in hordes once the schools announce holidays for the festival of colours,” he said.
 
 Water guns apart, masks of different characters, including ghosts and demons, are also sell like hot cakes every year. Each one costs anything between Rs 100 and Rs 350. “Masks add to the mood of Holi revelry,” explained Amit  , a student who bought a demon mask for Rs 300 from one of the makeshift shops near Boring Road roundabout.
 
 PROTECT YOUR PET:
 
 Colours can spell trouble for furry animals, pet or otherwise. “The chemicals used in the colours can cause eczema, eye irritation, lung infections and gastrointestinal disorders besides psychological trauma to dogs,” said vet  .
 
 “Sweets and oily snacks are also a strict no-no for your furry friends,” Dr Kumar said and appealed to the people not to apply colour to even street dogs.
