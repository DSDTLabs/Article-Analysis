Mumbai: The   have booked a man who allegedly cheated at least 12 youths of lakhs of rupees by promising them jobs on a foreign cruise liner.

 On May 19, the victims filed a complaint against Amit Modak, who collected processing fees ranging from Rs 35,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh between November 2017 and April, but failed to get them jobs as housekeeper, helper, loader, cleaner and dishwasher on the cruise liner. They claimed that when they confronted Modak, he challenged them to file a police complaint. 
 
 A police officer said, “We are collecting details of the whereabouts of the accused. He is even wanted at Arnala Sagari police station in Palghar. In March, he had duped   of Rs 6.6 lakh with the same modus operandi.” 
 
 Manojkumar Rai (28), a Powai resident who is in the hospitality industry, said Modak, who claimed to a job agent, had promised to get him a supervisor’s job in the housekeeping department on the cruise liner. “I paid Modak Rs 35,000 for visa fees, continuous discharge certificate and an interview. He asked me to get two more job aspirants and I convinced my uncle and a friend to apply. I transferred Rs 1.2 lakh to Modak’s account. But when I did not get an interview call for long, I called up Modak in April and asked him for a refund. He refused and threatened me, saying he did not fear the police.” 
 
 Mayuresh Pawaskar (19), a second-year student from Powai, said his father took a loan to pay Modak Rs 55,000 for a housekeeping attendant’s job on the cruise liner. 
 
 Bandra resident Ganesh N, employed in a private company, said, “Modak duped me of Rs 40,000. He also bought two phones, collectively worth Rs 44,000, from my friend, but didn’t pay him.” tnn
