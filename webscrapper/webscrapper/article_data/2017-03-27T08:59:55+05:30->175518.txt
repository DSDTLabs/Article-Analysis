Vadodara: Nearly 10 days after street vendors from different parts of the city were evicted from their regular business spots, members of the   will meet with chief minister   on Monday to seek a resolution on the issue.

 So far, the   (VMC) has evicted street vendors selling food items from Racecourse, Old Padra Road, Fatehgunj and Akota. The civic body claimed that a large number of vendors were operating without registrations under the Food Safety and Standards Act. Several street vendors claimed that even those who had obtained stay orders against their ouster earlier were removed.
 
 Earlier, the vendors had met and submitted a memorandum to the district collector asking for the street vending policy to be implemented in the city. They stated that the VMC was yet to give them alternative locations to do their business. They said the collector had been unable to provide a solution in absence of a street vending policy.
 
 Varish Ali Saiyed, a street vendor, said, “The civic body is supposed to designate hawking zones in the city where we can legally work and pay taxes. But the VMC has not yet done anything of the sort so far and has removed us even though we have been paying the taxes.”
 
 The street vendors across the city had taken out a rally on March 18 to protest the ousting but even that had no effect.
 
 Saiyed will visit Rupani along with Narayan Rajput alias Saddam, Shoib Khan Pathan and others in Gandhinagar to seek a compromise on the matter.
 
 “We only want a place to work and eke out a living. We need Rs 200 a day to make ends meet. If the VMC won’t let us work. then it must at least compensate for it,” he said.
 
 The vendors have started looking for other places within the city from where they are willing to work as a compromise. “We hope it won’t come to that. We are hoping that at least the CM will listen to us on this matter,” said Saiyed.
