KOLKATA: Actor   was sent to four more days of jail custody by an Alipore court on Monday on the charges of culpable homicide not amounting to   for the death of  . On Monday, Chatterjee was brought to the court around 11.30am with 12 others in a prison van. 

 The same court had sent him to Alipore jail cancelling his bail petition on July 10. On Monday, his lawyers did not even move a bail petition as an anticipatory bail hearing is already impending at a sessions court on Wednesday.
 
 The courtroom, however, witnessed a verbal duel between Chatterjee's lawyers and the state counsel and lawyers representing Chauhan over the hearing of custody trial.
 
  Chatterjee's lawyers refused to start the hearing of custody trial on Monday and sought time from the court alleging that they were yet to receive a copy of the chargesheet, which was submitted before the court last week. The court finally granted them time till Wednesday. 
 
 A custody trial often means an accused cannot get bail during the course of the trial and the actual conviction. Had the magistrate allowed a custody trial on Monday, Chatterjee would have found it difficult to get bail from the sessions court on Wednesday.
 
 "We have not received a copy of the chargesheet and so we opposed the hearing. Also, the cops sought for cancellation of the statement of the ola driver Rajesh Kr Pal, who had taken Vikram and   to the hospital is a key witness in the incident. We said we needed time to look through the chargesheet before taking part in the hearing process," said Anirban Guha Thakurta, Chatterjee's lawyer.
