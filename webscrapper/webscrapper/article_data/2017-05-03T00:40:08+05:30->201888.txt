Nagpur: Popular narrators like Shraddha Bharadwaj (Vividh Bharti) and Anjali Durugkar (All India Radio) brought life to the stories like ‘Anubandh’ by Shanta Shelke, ‘Kanyadaan’ by Sumati Kshtramale, ‘Shah Ki Kanjri’ by Amruta Pritam and ‘Bhikarin’ by Rabindranath Tagore, in a   session titled ‘Inspire’. The event was organized by Excel Interior Design Institute (EIDI) on Saturday.

 The stories were set in the pre-independence era and revolved around the theme of women empowerment.
 
 For the book lovers, EIDI organizes book reading session every month. But, this time on the occasion of its second anniversary, the institute brought in narrators in a bid to give readers the joy of listening instead of reading. The aim of the institute behind organizing such an event was to revive the culture of book reading at the time when e-book trend is catching up.
 
 The two narrators focused on the medium of expression, intonation and voice modulation by creating a dramatic effect on the listeners as they sat mesmerized.
 
 Prachi Raj, one of the organizers, said, “Though I am a doctor, I love reading stories. This narration was hypnotizing as it almost moved me away from the reality. This kind of narration is incomparable to any e-learning medium. It brought tears to my eyes.”
 
 Sunita Wadhaan from the audience felt in sync with the stories. “This took me back to my childhood days and I could feel myself connecting to the past. I was able to deeply understand every emotion expressed through the stories,” she said while speaking to TOI.
 
 Narrator Shraddha Bharadwaj said that she loves narrating stories because it gives a feel to the words. “Every emotion can be expressed very clearly through the art of narration. These stories contain a lot of values from the past and it is necessary to inculcate these values in today's world,” she said adding it is very hard to strike a chord with the reader through electronic media.
