He's among the few who resisted the realty lure and held on to his farm along the   in  , 25km from the city centre. But the huge pile of waste dumped every day at the abandoned Bellahalli quarry, next to his land, has made things really difficult for   in the recent times.

 Located in the vicinity of  , Hemanna's potato farm has been invaded by hordes of insects, destroying his yield with a majority of potatoes having large holes.His blue grape farm has met a similar fate, with the grapes wilting before they are fully ripe. Inadequate rainfall and unhygienic atmosphere has led to 75% crop loss in a year.
 
 Though dumping stopped at the nearby Mittaganahalli quarry-turned garbage dump, Bellahalli dump had to make space for an additional 800 tonnes of waste.
 
 Hemanna's is a joint family of 25 members who live near Bellahalli. “We didn't want to give our land to these realtors. We do farming on it, grow vegetables. But it's becoming increasingly difficult with each passing day . Insects and mosquitoes started eating up plant leaves and gradually destroyed the potato tubes buried in the ground,“ says Hemanna.
 
 More than 160 trucks bring a massive 1,600 tonnes of waste every day to the Bellahalli dumpyard, the horrible stench from which makes the place and the nearby areas unlivable.“You cannot bear that stench, and we have to live with it. We use room freshener, but that hasn't been of much help,“ says Mansoor Ahmed, a Bellahalli resident.
