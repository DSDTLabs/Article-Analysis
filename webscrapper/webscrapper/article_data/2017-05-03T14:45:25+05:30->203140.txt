When it comes to beauty, Koreans are never afraid to try new things. From snail-slime face packs to volcanic clay masks, Korean women love to experiment with their beauty techniques. And the latest Korean trend will just surprise you! Women are now submerging their faces in water to achieve flawless make-up. 

 
 This technique is called ‘jamsu’ which translates to diving in Korean. The   beauty trick involves coating your face with baby powder and then submerging the made-up face in the cold water for 30 seconds. 
 
 Wondering why beauty buffs are swearing by this trick? The trick of using baby powder (which works like baking) and water dunking seals the make-up—which means you’ll get long lasting melt-proof make-up. So, if you want matte, oil-free skin in summers, this trick might come handy.
