Erode: Forest officials have started to refill the ponds that have dried up in the forest to prevent the drought-hit wild animals from venturing into human habitats for water and the resultant man-animal conflicts. “Animals such as elephants, deer, bear, Indian Gaur and leopards have started to come out of the deep forest to nearby villages in search of water and fodder. It may intensify incidents of man-animal conflict. So, we are filling up the ponds in the forest with the help of water tankers,” an official said. According to the official, water bodies in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, T N Palayam, Thalawadi, Bargoor, Hasanur, Dhimbam and Bhavanisagar forest areas have gone dry, forcing animals to venture into the plains to quench their thirst. “Lakes, ponds and artificial ponds created by us in the forests have all dried up as the mercury levels have gone up in the district,” the official said. When animals such as deer enter into the villages adjacent to reserve forest, they are mostly attacked by stray dogs. In the case of elephants and leopards, chances of them attacking humans are very high, the official further said. Taking the threat of man-animal conflict into consideration, district forest officials had ordered the rangers to fill the water bodies in the forest. The forest officials are also monitoring the movement of animals coming to the water bodies with the help of CCTV cameras.
