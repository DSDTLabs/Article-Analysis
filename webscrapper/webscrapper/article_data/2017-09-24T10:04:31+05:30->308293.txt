MOHALI: After Municipal Corporation (MC) transferred the tainted cattle catching team leader Kesar Singh on suspicion of connivance with dairy owners, MC has not yet appointed a new leader in his place. 

 The entire exercise of MC to curtail the   menace has turned futile as it fails to take immediate action to start the cattle catching activity bringing relief to the residents. Many residents, especially from sectors adjoining villages have been approaching the MC with their complaints of stray cattle invading parks outside their houses.
 
 Councillors have also been raising the issue from time to time, but to no avail. Darshan Singh, a resident of Sector 69 said, “We have a village next to our sector where many dairy owners let their cattle lose after milking. The stray ones keep on grazing in the park opposite our houses and also defecate there making the park stinking.”
 
 Councillor Sukhdev Singh Patwari said, “The MC employees are hand-in-glove with dairy owners which causes major loss to the MC as well as residents. MC must act tough with such defaulters.”
 
 Recently MC has also raised the challan for stray cattle from Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000. Interestingly it has no data of challans issued to stray cattle owners and neither does it have any record of the number of stray cattle caught in the recent past.
