Mumbai: A   inmate who is a witness to the   custodial death, made an application before an   on Tuesday seeking deportation to  . Rehana Gayan, who was arrested earlier this year on charges of being an illegal immigrant, pleaded guilty in the case and requested that she be deported. 

 Rehana, her husband and three other men were arrested from Meghwadi on May 15 and booked under the Indian Passport Act and the Foreigners Act. 
 
 The magistrate, AA Panchbhai, observed that Rehana was one of the witnesses in the Shetye death case where an FIR was filed by an inmate. The magistrate observed something appeared "suspicious". He declined her application and framed charges against all five accused. 
 
 When the matter was called out for their remand, the four male accused said they wanted to plead guilty and sought that their sentence be set off against the time already served as "under-trials". The magistrate appeared surprised and asked them if they making the request on their own or had someone suggested it. The court asked if they knew the maximum sentence their crime attracted under the law. It is five years imprisonment. 
 
 The magistrate told public prosecutor Laxman Rathod then about the written plea made by the woman accused and that she was a witness in the Shetye murder case. "She is a witness. how can she be deported?" said the magistrate. He framed charges under various sections of the Indian Passport Act and Foreigners Act against the five and posted the case for recording their plea and evidence on July 25. 
 
 Rehanaâ€™s husband, however, did not seem to have sought deportation.
 
 The FIR in the custodial death case after Manjula was beaten by prison staff on June 23 was registered only after other inmates, including Indrani Mukerjea, a prime accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, protested and demanded its registration.
