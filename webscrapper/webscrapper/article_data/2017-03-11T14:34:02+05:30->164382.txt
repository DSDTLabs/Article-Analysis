PANAJI: Congress state party president and Congress chief minister nominee   makes a comeback to state electoral politics. Faleiro is leading by nearly 2000 votes in Navelim constituency with BJP-backed independent candidate Avertano   already accepting defeat.

 Former chief minister Faleiro was elevated to General Secretary in the   in 2013 but was brought back to Goa to lead the party’s revival after the grand old party’s dismal performance in 2012 state assembly elections.
 Furtado’s hopes of being the first independent candidate to make history by getting reelected as an independent candidate were dashed by Faleiro who pulled in 3479 votes to Furtado’s 2778 votes. Counting remains on and the final results have yet to be declared by the Election Commission of India.
