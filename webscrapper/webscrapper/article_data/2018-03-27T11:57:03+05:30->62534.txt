VIJAYAWADA: Government doctors across the city are gearing up to intensify their agitation for an increase in their in-service   seats in postgraduate medical courses. Government order allocating 50% seats to the national pool has come under severe criticism from government   as they are losing 50% of their seats. APGDA will conduct a general body meeting in the city on 28 March and will give a call for Chalo Vijayawada. 

  Government Doctors Association (APGDA) working committee convenor Dr Jayadheer said, “While governments of Odisha and Chhattisgarh are giving 50% of their seats to the in-service doctors, AP government is giving only 30% of the seats to us and half our seats have now gone to the national pool.”
 
 Government doctors have been instrumental in implementing various national and state-level health programs like pulse polio immunization, Mission Indradhanush, Janmabhoomi and the recent Palakarimpu Programme while discharging their regular duties at the primary healthcare centres and yet the governments are not considering our requests to increase the in- service quota to 50%, said Dr Jayadheer.
 
 “We have appeared for the Neet   entrance in January, while participating in the Janmabhoomi program and a majority of the government doctors failed to performs well, said Dr Naveen. 
 
 “The Andhra Pradesh government will award incentive marks of 7.5% and 10% of the marks obtained by individual candidates in MBBS per year, subject to a maximum of 30% marks, to be added to the actual marks obtained by the candidates in Neet and then consider them as general candidates instead of giving them a separate quota. This amendment will result in loss of morale in the doctors leading to fall in the quality of the service we render,” he added.
