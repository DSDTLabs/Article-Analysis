HOWRAH: A black cat crossing your path is bad luck... only if the driver in front of you slams the brakes suddenly, believing the old wives’ tale. Five people in Howrah learnt this lesson the hard way on Wednesday a stone’s throw from Nabanna, the state secretariat, after they were involved in a pile-up, thanks to a superstitious driver going from 40 to zero in a fraction of a second after a black cat crosssed his path.

 
 While slamming on the brakes is quite a common practice among city drivers, it has the potential to cause serious accidents, even fatalities. That the five escaped with mere injuries on Wednesday can be attributed to massive good luck, and not bad luck by any stretch of the imagination.
 
 The pile-up was triggered when the driver of a hatchback, moving at 40kmph, suddenly hit the brakes after seeing the black feline on the second Hooghly bridge around 10.20am. The driver of an SUV, which was behind him, failed to halt on time and smashed behind it. Behind the SUV was another hatchback, followed by a van. The drivers of these vehicles, too, failed to halt on time. All cars were moving towards Kazipara from the Kona Expressway. The accident unfolded in less than a minute, with all cars being damaged and their drivers and a passenger hurt.
 
 The injured were identified as Radhakanta Mondal, Bikash Biyani, Mahendra Das, Asif Ali and  . They were taken to   and discharged after primary treatment.
 
 The first hatchback’s driver,  , was fined for negligent driving. During his interrogation, Shau told cops that he applied the brakes to avoid “any incident” that the cat’s crossing would have brought upon him.
 
 “A driver’s superstitious belief caused the accident,” Howrah City Police ACP (traffic) Ashok Nath Chatterjee said. “We’ve explained the gravity of this action to him and warned him. He pledged he won’t let such a belief to cause any such incident in the future.”
