Ludhiana: A team of MC officials sealed the gate of a commercial building under construction on Rajpura Road, near Dandi Swami Chowk, on Wednesday morning for not renewing the building-plan approval. The MC also razed an illegal part of a residential building under construction in BRS Nagar. 

 An MC official said the commercial building’s plan was sanctioned for the site on Rajpura Road in 2014 and it expired in 2016. For a commercial building, it is necessary to complete construction work within two years of the approval of the plan. “But in this case, the owner started construction now,” said the MC official.
 
 The official said they had even asked the owners to get the building plan renewed before construction work. But when no permission was taken, MC sealed the building. In all, the commercial building’s area is around 4,200 square yards. MC assistant town planner (headquarters) S S Bindra said they were now calculating the amount to be recovered from the owners of the property. “It will be around Rs 22 lakh, but the building will remain sealed till then,” he said.
 
 The MC demolished the residential structure under construction in BRS Nagar for violating building bylaws. Officials also issued warning to the owner to not violate the bylaws again.
