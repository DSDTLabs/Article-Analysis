BENGALURU: Though the Centre announced several measures to meet the currency demand in the country - which it termed 'unusual' - Bengalureans continued to be inconvenienced as ATMs of several banks were out of cash on Tuesday. Customers said 'no-cash' boards were a common sight across the city and they had to run from pillar to post to withdraw money. 

 When TOI visited the   on  , security guard Sharath Perida said, "There is no cash right now. The machine was last replenished only on Monday." 
 
  
  
 "I have travel plans to Hyderabad but since I'm unable to withdraw money, I may have to cancel them," said Kajal Fitkiriwala, a BBA student from Christ University.
 
 Only Rs 2,000 notes were available at the Axis   on Hosur Main Road, with customers complaining of lack of lower denominations like Rs 100 or Rs 500 since Monday. A no-cash board was also spotted at a   in Adugodi.
 
 "Though Paytm and PhonePe are gaining popularity, we still need hard cash for daily purposes. The cash crisis at ATMs is making things difficult for us," said  , an intern at Vodafone. Customers fear their woes will only aggravate on Wednesday, which is a state government holiday.
 
  Not a problem for some 
 
  However, there were customers who didn't face any problem in withdrawing cash. Harasd (@imapatel) tweeted: "I'm from Karnataka/Bangalore and there is nothing like currency crisis or cash  , Today I withdrew some amount from the ATM, some people are simply trying to panic the situation (sic)." 
 
 P Nair said: "There's no problem in the area where I live. All ATMs are disbursing cash, including the new Rs 200 notes. So the news of cash crunch comes as a surprise to me."
