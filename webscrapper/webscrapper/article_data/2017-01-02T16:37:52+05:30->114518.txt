KOHIMA: Churches in Nagaland took the lead in welcoming 2017 by organizing services across the state. After a night of bursting crackers, revellers made the most of Sunday by thronging picnic spots and tourist sites. 

 Official sources said no major accident had been reported in the state but a few minor accidents took place around midnight on Saturday.
 
  greeted the people on the occasion and said, "As the world wakes up to a new dawn , I extend my heartfelt greetings and sincere wishes to all communities in Nagaland." He added, "May the New Year shower us with opportunities, vision, and success at every step of the way. Let us rededicate ourselves to building a new era of peace and embark on a new journey towards development in all fields of life." 
 
 The year promises to be a challenging one for the ruling Naga People's Front (NPF). Its first major test would be winning the upcoming civic polls on February 1. The results may well foreshadow those of the assembly election to be held in the early part of 2018.
 
 A total of three municipal and 29 town councils will vote on February 1; 120 of the 353 wards, or a little over 33%, will be reserved for women. The NPF, Congress and BJP, along with Independents, will contest the election and Congress has already released its manifesto.
 
 Some prominent NGOs -   (APO), Ao Senden (Hoho),   (ENPO),   and   - have sought a boycott of the polls.
