KOLKATA: The building that will come up at 3   after the fire-ravaged   is demolished may be twice the size of the previous one.

 A legislation that was recently introduced to facilitate redevelopment of unsafe and dilapidated buildings by offering 100% floor area ratio (FAR), will apply in the reconstruction of the Burrabazar site.
 
 “Our officials will visit the spot before finalizing the demolition. But once it's demolished, the promoter will get the benefit of extra FAR,“ said a senior official of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.
 
 The   buildings department will also sanction plans from tenants requesting repair work of the building. This building is likely to be the first beneficiary since the legislation was introduced four months ago.
 
 Meanwhile, a forensic team that visited the fire-ravaged building, suspected that the fire had possibly started from the godown in the first floor, instead of a ground-floor godown. “The way the first floor has come down on the ground floor suggests that possibly one of the godown in the eastern side of the building was the seat of fire,“ one of the officials said.
