Bollywood filmmaker   has received a death threat from an unidentified caller who has demanded a sum of Rs 50 lakh to be deposited in a Lucknow-based bank branch. According to reports, the caller has claimed that failure on Mahesh’s part to meet their demand would result in the death of his actress daughter 
  and wife Soni Razdan. 

 
 
 An ANI tweet confirmed that Bhatt filed a complaint in the Juhu Police station following the death threat.
 
  
  
 Mahesh also took to Twitter early this morning to say that the extortion attempt was “nipped in the bud”, all thanks to the MP and UP police.
 
  
  
 According to reports, Bhatt received a threat call on February 26, which was initially believed to be a prank call. A series of text messages and WhatsApp messages followed the call and a person claiming to be a gang leader threatened that if he failed to pay up, the person would fire rounds of bullets at daughter Alia and wife Soni. 
 
 Fearing for the safety of his family, Bhatt filed a case on Wednesday under section 387 (causing a person to fear death or grievous hurt, in order to commit extortion). As per latest updates, the Anti Extortion Cell of the Mumbai Police with help of UP STF have identified the culprit and detained him.
 
 
  
 This threat comes two years after a group of 13 people were arrested on November 2014 for plotting to kill Mahesh Bhatt.
