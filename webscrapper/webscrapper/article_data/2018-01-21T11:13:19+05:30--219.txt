AMRITSAR: Amritsar-based retired senior civil engineer from railways BM Singh has hand-crafted a vintage look limited capacity   for daily commute. “This car works on the same principle as that of e-rickshaws. I have changed the body, made a few changes and some additions to give it a look and it has already become a darling of the city,” the octogenarian engineer told TOI.

 Fitted with an accelerator, a brake and a rubber bulb horn, the two-door ‘City Queen’, as Singh calls his new toy, drives between 90-100km carrying four persons with a charging of around eight hours. The car also has a button that drives the motor in reverse direction for backing it.
 
 Singh becomes a centre of attraction wherever he goes in his retro-look car. He claims to have spent around Rs 1.75 lakh in fabricating the body, fitting four batteries of 12 volts each, making a rexine roof and using   motorcycle’s spoke wheels to increase height and ground clearance.
 
 “Presently I am driving within city limits but once I replace these traditional batteries with lithium ones, then not only the car speed will increase from the present 40 to 70 km but it will cover over 200 km in single charging and I can easily travel to other cities,” he said, adding that presently his version of e-car didn’t require any registration with the transport department.
 
 “There may be requirement of registration or other formalities when its new version with high speed will come,” he added.
 
 Singh, who retired from Amritsar railways 23 years ago, said his tailor-made e-car could fulfil dreams of those who wanted a cheap and best mode of transportation to deal with city traffic with squeezed parking areas. “This e-car is a boon for people who are not into mad race of speed. Is mein bas masti say chalte jaao (go at an easy pace). Soon I am going to put an embalm of tortoise and hare to put forth my point,” he said.
