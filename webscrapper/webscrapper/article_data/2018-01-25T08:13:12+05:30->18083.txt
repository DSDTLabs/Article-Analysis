CHANDIGARH: Stray cattle have taken over the space around Plot 5 of the   in   and these herds have ravaged the surroundings.

 The cattle herds on the Hallomajra-Chandigarh-Panchkula   and invade the nearby factories. The factory workers who take this road have to dodge cows and buffaloes while driving. "The cattle menace is severe in the area,"  , a regular commuter, said. "The herds are getting bigger and bigger. Many cows and buffaloes sit on the roadsides and sometimes even occupy the road. A few days ago, a motorcyclist fell off his two-wheeler near the Hallomajra intersection when a stray buffalo jumped into his path."
 
 The cattle have also encroached upon pavements, medians and the roadside curbs. The surroundings at various places are littered with cow dung, which has made the sanitary situation extremely grim. "This matter has been reported the civic authorities a couple of times but the municipal corporations of Panchkula and Chandigarh keep passing the buck to each other over the origin of the cattle. If the herds stay on the road, many more people will get injured," Pankaj added.
