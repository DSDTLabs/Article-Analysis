Chennai: A police sub inspector and two constables attached to the MKB Nagar police station have landed in trouble after they allegedly bought stolen   bikes from a mechanic at Flower Bazaar on Thursday night. Police arrested the mechanic and a friend of his who had stolen 16 bikes.

 An internal probe has been ordered to find out the role of the policemen – SI Balamurugan and constables Karthik and Suresh – in   the  .
 
 The incident came to light when police were probing a complaint of a bike theft from a government hospital. The Flower Bazaar police team, which was investigating the case, found the involvement of a mechanic identified as Shah-In-Shah, (30), who runs a shop on M.K.B Nagar X Cross Street.
 
 When confronted, the mechanic maintained that he only helped his friend, who stole bikes, to dispose of the vehicles. Based on his tip, police nabbed Mohammed Shareef, (30), a habitual offender. When police tried to get hold of him, he slit his wrist, using a blade to prevent police from arresting him.   was subsequently admitted to the Government Stanley Hospital for treatment.
 
 Preliminary investigations revealed that Mohammed Shareef had stolen as many as 16 bikes, all Royal Enfield. He had given nine bikes to the policemen to sell. Since the mechanic was good at servicing Royal Enfield bikes, he came in contact with several customers who helped him in selling the bikes. 
 
 Police said he would alter the bikes as soon as he got them. “He would take copies of the registration books of vehicles which came in for service and forge them. Using these, he would sell the vehicles to unsuspecting customers,” said an investigating officer.
 
 Police have recovered nine bikes from them. Investigations are on to trace the remaining bikes.
 
 Meanwhile, the policemen claimed that they were not aware that those were stolen bikes. “We have ordered an internal probe. Action will be intiated against the policemen if found guilty,” said a senior police officer.
