NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal Nehru University will soon have a special Centre for   Studies, which will also cover ‘Islamic Terrorism’. 

 
 The proposal made at the 145th academic council (AC) meeting saw objections from   Students’ Union (JNUSU) members and teachers who called it “an attempt at “Islamophobic propaganda.” They were also upset with the way the meeting was “finished in 30 minutes and did not discuss any of the eight agendas placed before it.”
 
 In the report tabled at the meeting, the new proposed centre proclaimed that JNU “can impart an academic perspective to security issues challenging India… and will study the contemporary nature of threats it faces in all aspects.” Along with Islamic terrorism, the centre will also cover military modernisation of China and Pakistan, defence economics, nuclear proliferation and data arms control and disarmament, civil military relations, naxalism and other aspects.
 
 “No member, including the deans and chairs reinstated by the Delhi high court, were allowed to speak at all. It is alarming that the highest academic body of the university, in which ‘due deliberation’ must be accorded to all academic matters, was conducted by means of open suppression of dissent,” said Sonajharia Minhz, JNUTA president.
 
 She said 33 members of the council have submitted a letter to the JNU registrar raising the issue and complained how they were not allowed to speak despite repeated requests. 
 
 Despite repeated attempts, JNU administration did not respond to the allegations levelled by the students and the teachers.
