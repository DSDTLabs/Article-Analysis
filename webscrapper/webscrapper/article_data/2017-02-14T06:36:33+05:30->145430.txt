 Parents’ associations from Chandigarh and Chennai will also take part in the meeting. Besides discussing issues like students’ safety, frequent fee hikes and commercialization of education, the meeting will focus on forming a national-level association to curb the menace. The parents’ body then aims to submit a petition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding a central school fee regulatory body. 
 
 Orlando Pacheco, a petitioner from Goa, said that with the growing commercialisation of education, parents’ associations across the country are demanding a central legislation such as ‘Regulation of Fee Act’ to put an end to the rising cost of education.
 
 It may be recalled that in 2009, the All Goa Unaided Schools Parents’ Association had filed a writ petition in the high court to have fee structures of private unaided schools regulated by the directorate of education. The petition is pending for final hearing.
