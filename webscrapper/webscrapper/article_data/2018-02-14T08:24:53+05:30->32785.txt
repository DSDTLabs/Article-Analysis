PANCHKULA: East Bengal’s attacking midfielder Cavin Lobo scored through a long ranger in the 60th minute as the Kolkata side defeated hosts   FC 1-0 in a keenly-fought   encounter at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium, here on Tuesday. With the win,   now have 26 points from 14 games and have cut down Minerva’s lead to just three points at the top of the table.

 
 Third-placed East Bengal now have 26 points with Minerva still atop the points table with 29 points. Both the sides have four matches remaining, while second-placed Neroca FC are on 28 points but have played a match extra.
 
 After the final whistle, East Bengal coach Khalid Jamil went towards the sidelines, thanking the visiting fans and soaking up their acclaim. A day prior to the match, Jamil was confident that his team could still win the league and his boys did pull off something special in Panchkula. The early stages were broadly scrappy, with East Bengal orchestrating the better chances. Syrian international Al Amna and Japanese midfielder Katsumi Yusa had their shots saved brilliantly by Minerva goalkeeper Rakshit Dagar. While East Bengal had the better control of the game, the best chance came Minerva’s way in the 30th minute when Eric Dano shot from inside the box was brilliantly saved by East Bengal goalie CK Ubaid.
 
 East Bengal were denied a clear penalty just before half-time when Laldanmawia Ralte’s shot inside the box hit the hands of Eric Dano. Coach Jamil was clearly not amused with the decision. East Bengal started the second-half with much poise. On the other hand, Minerva coach   made his first change as Bazie Armand was taken off and Abhishek Ambekar replaced him to provide more strength to the midfield. The deadlock was finally broken at the hour mark with Cavin Lobo finding the net with a terrific a long distance strike into the top corner of the net. Lobo’s strike silenced the home crowd.
