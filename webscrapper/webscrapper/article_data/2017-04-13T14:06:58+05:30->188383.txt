 started trending all over social media for his take on   stars endorsing fairness products. He posted a series of Facebook posts where he shared images of all the renowned faces of the entertainment industry who have propagated the idea of being “fair” to be successful and beautiful.

 While none of the celebrities whose pictures were shared by the ‘Dev D’ actor reciprocated in any way, the style diva of Bollywood,   took to   and posted a response. What aimed to be a sarcastic tweet, made her fall into the ‘troll’ trap instead. The embarrassed actress had to later delete her tweet.
 
 She tweeted a picture of Abhay Deol’s half-sister Esha Deol, endorsing a fairness product and said, “@AbhayDeol I appreciate and concur with your views and would like to know your thoughts on this as well!" 
  
  
  
 I guess Sonam didn’t realise the repercussions of her tweets and how badly times they were.
