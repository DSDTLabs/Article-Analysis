LUCKNOW: Baba Saheb BR Ambedkar’s growing acceptance extended to the   headquarters on Saturday when a bronze bust of the architect of Indian Constitution was unveiled by party president   on Ambedkar Jayanti.
 
 It is the first statue of Ambedkar to be installed in SP headquarters since the party came into being in 1992.
 
 The watershed event, that came barely a month after SP and   announced their tie-up for 2019 Lok Sabha elections, also saw Akhilesh Yadav taking a pledge along with party workers to follow the principles of secularism and socialism enshrined in the Constitution drafted by Ambedkar.
 
 The statue found a place besides similar busts of socialist ideologues Ram Manohar Lohia, Jai Prakash Narain, Raj Narain, Karpoori Thakur and   and became a permanent fixture on the stage of   auditorium in SP headquarters. Unveiling the bust, SP chief called upon the party leaders to take a pledge to follow the path of socialism and secularism. “Presently, the political parties in power are either ignorant about Indian Constitution or have conveniently forgotten it to suit their political interests,” said Akhilesh.
 
 It is time to realize that unless the underprivileged and downtrodden are given a helping hand, the country’s progress will remain hampered, he added.
 
 Not only at party headquarters, SP workers celebrated Ambedkar Jayanti across the state like never before. The party had issued a circular directing its cadres to hold events at district level to mark Ambedkar Jayanti.
