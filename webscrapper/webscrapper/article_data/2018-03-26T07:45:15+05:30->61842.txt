AHMEDABAD: Some 17   are set to come up near the   of Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC). Well-placed sources in the state government revealed that these manufacturing units will be established in Bhagapura, which is located some 36km from Hansalpur, where the Japanese automobile giant has recently set up a car manufacturing plant.

 Foreign as well as domestic automotive components manufacturers such as Mubea Automotive Components India Pvt Ltd, NHK Spring India Ltd, NTF (India) Pvt Ltd, Minda Industries and Sellowrap Industries, are among those which will be setting up manufacturing units. Investments worth Rs 836 crore will be made by these companies in the state, revealed state government officials.
 
 “With 17 ancillary units aiming to set up manufacturing facilities, the estate will attract a cumulative investment of around Rs 836 crore. This will help create significant employment in the state,” said M K Das, principal secretary – industries and mines, government of Gujarat.
 
 Currently, none of these companies have begun operations, as it is a new estate. Top sources in Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) revealed that the land plots to be allotted to these companies have already been finalized. “We have already finalized the land plots that will be allotted to these companies. We will be issuing the allotment letters by next week,” said a top source in GIDC.
 
 A total of 40 hectares of land has been earmarked for allotment to the 17 companies. State government pegs that these units will help create significant employment in the state. Conservative estimates by top GIDC officials indicate that this will help generate direct employment for at least 1,500 people along with an additional employment for 2,000 people indirectly through logistics and other allied industries.
 
 “When major players make investments, ancillary units are set up subsequently thus generating employment in the state,” said a senior GIDC official.
