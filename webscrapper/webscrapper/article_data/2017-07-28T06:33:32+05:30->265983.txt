PUNE: The   on Thursday raised   about the   of Sinhagad fortâ€™s ghat section in the Assembly.

 MLA Bhimrao Tapkir demanded a clarification on the delay in installation of safety nets to prevent landslide and repair of the ghat road. Former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar demanded urgent steps to ensure safety of thousands of daily visitors to the fort. He urged the government to seek details from the public works department (PWD) and the state forest department on why the work was not completed before monsoon.
 
 The state revenue and PWD minister, Chandrakant Patil, said the government had made the required allotment of funds for the installation of nets and road repair. A survey of the landslide vulnerable spots in the ghat has been done by an expert team of IIT-Bombay. The work would be completed before March 2018, he said.
 
 The Sinhagad road ghat section has been in a poor state for the past few months. The PWD and the state forest department were supposed to work in coordination to install safety nets on rocks and repair the road. But they failed to meet the deadline of completing both works before monsoon.
 
 The work for installation of safety nets is likely to begin only after monsoon. TOI highlighted the issue in its June 7, 2017 edition and problems being faced by visitors.
 
 A source in the PWD said the work was delayed because the department was yet to complete the tendering process to select the agency to install the safety iron mesh in the ghat. Officials of the state forest department said they did not have the expertise to repair the ghat road and fix iron mesh. They claimed PWD was supposed to take up these works.
 
 Rush of tourists at  , especially during monsoon weekends, is common. According to estimates, over 10,000 people visited the fort in the last weekend. It led to slowing of traffic movement in the 9-km ghat section, going to the fort. About 10 spots are vulnerable to landslides here.
