Marking music director V Harikrishna’s 100th film as a composer with   film  , the audio launch for this film is probably one that his listeners will remember for a long time to come. No, this isn’t about having that one big gala event to commemorate Harikrishna’s glorious career — which is no mean feat at that. What is happening instead is that the makers have planned a two-week-long release, starting today, where each of the six songs on the album are released every alternate day.
 “The album has six songs sung by popular singers like Sonu Nigam, Shreya Ghoshal, Vijay Prakash etc. Even Ganesh, Duniya Vijay and Ananth Nag have pitched in, in this department in their own way. We are looking at the possibility of having Harikrishna sing too. The idea behind releasing each song one after the other is to honour each of Harikrishna’s songs here,” says director  .
  While this is Harikrishna’s 100th film as composer, there have been only a handful of films that see him working with Yogaraj Bhat as a team, but the latter reveals this about the composer, “Harikrishna can be very wicked at times, but he can also bring in the best of traditional classical music when required. He began his career as a keyboardist and, therefore, has an advantage as he has a great understanding of sound, rhythm and beat. Knowing and understanding sound is an infinite art form that very few are blessed with. Tradition has proved that women are better at composing, they are the ones who have sung soothing lullabies to their babies over many decades. I believe a composer needs to have that sort of command and strength over his art form and Harikrishna has that,” explains Yogaraj.
  The audio of one of the film’s songs  , on GST, has gone viral online. Today, the team will launch the song in Hubballi officially.
