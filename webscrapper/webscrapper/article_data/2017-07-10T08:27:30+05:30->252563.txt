BENGALURU; Everyone is familiar with the drill. People getting their vehicles refuelled at stations must ensure they are paying the right price for the quantity they're getting. However, a product developed by students of   in   promises to ensure no patron has to turn around in their seats or disembark from their vehicles to keep track of the metre. A display on the fuel gun shows the customer exactly how much money worth of petrol is being filled.

 The petrol gun display invention, developed by final-year computer science students Manjunath M and Aishah S, consists of a small digital display mounted atop the fuel gun, an Arduino microcontroller, 7-segment display unit to show the values and shift registers. The software of the microcontroller performs all the functions of the device, while the display shows the same meter readings seen on the pump box, but in reverse lettering format that can be read through the rearview mirror.
 
 Manjunath M, 22, believes the device could be useful for drivers, particularly senior citizens and the disabled. “Whenever I would be in the car with my uncle, he would always make me get out of the vehicle to check if the numbers were correct. We took the concept of reverse lettering from ambulances and applied it here. Since we knew the science of the invention, but not necessarily about the physical assembly, professor Dinesh helped us out with technical guidance,“ he said. It took more than a month to build the device at a cost of Rs 2,000.
 
 Dr Dinesh Anvekar, professor of electronics & communication and R&D director in the project development cell, said the product can check cheating cases.Madhukar Reddy , an HP pump proprietor on ITPL Main Road, was impressed by the demonstration and ordered one for his store. “It is an innovation in the fuelling space. Instead of turning and troubling yourself to check the metre, you can see it in your mirror,“ he said.
