PATNA:   on Monday night recovered the two girls whose parents had   cases after they had gone missing on March 27. But their statements stunned the cops as the girls had fled their homes to marry each other.
 
  The two girls, 23 and 17 years old belong to the same   under Bidupur police station area in Vaishali district.
  
  “We received a tip-off on Monday and recovered the girls from Hajipur railway station soon after they alighted from an autorickshaw,” Bidupur police station SHO Lalan Prasad Chaudhary told TOI over phone on Tuesday. He said the girls had fled to Mumbai.
  
  He said the girls reached Patna from Mumbai by   Express on Monday and took an autorickshaw to reach Hajipur. “The girls said they had been in relationship for the past two years, but their family members were strongly against it due to social stigma,” the SHO said and added that the elder girl was posing as a boy with short hairstyle.
  
  Quoting the girls, the SHO said they got married at a temple in Mumbai and were living in a hotel. “The elder girl had Rs45,000 with her when they fled to Mumbai. When left with only Rs3,000, they decided to return home,” he said.
  
  The SHO said both the families concealed the fact about their relationships from the police.
  
  “The elder girl, a student of BSc (chemistry) in a Patna college, was sent to jail while the teenager, who had just given her Class X examination conducted by the   Examination Board (BSEB), was sent to juvenile home after recording her statement before a judicial magistrate on Tuesday,” the SHO added.
  
  The father of the elder girl is a government employee posted at Patori in Sitamarhi while the minor’s father runs a shop in the village.
