CHANDIGARH: The   court on Saturday dismissed the anticipatory bail petitions of six retired and serving engineers as well as a supervisor, booked by the vigilance bureau in the multi-crore  . Earlier on September 11, the court had dismissed contractor Gurinder Singhâ€™s bail plea in the same case.

 All the accused are absconding since August 17. Those whose bail pleas were dismissed on Saturday are XENs Gulshan Nagpal and  , supervisor Vimal Kumar Sharma; retired chief engineers Paramjit Singh Ghuman, Harvinder Singh and Gurdev Singh Minah; and retired SDO Kaminder Singh Deol.
 
  vigilance bureau had on August 17 booked the contractor and seven others for criminal cheating, causing a loss worth crores to the state exchequer through favoured tendering of irrigation department projects.
 
 The Mohali court said that custodial interrogation of the accused was necessary to ascertain the entire scam. The vigilance bureau had opposed bail to the accused by submitting that the accused were hand in glove with contractor Gurinder Singh as they had favoured him through fraudulently allotting him various tenders in the past six-seven years.
 
 It was pleaded that terms and conditions for e-tendering of works were tailor- ade so as to eliminate other bidders and to allot work to Gurinder. Many tenders were allotted to the accused contractor on the basis of single bids and he charged excessive and inflated rates.
 
 During the investigation, the vigilance bureau had found that rates charged by the contractor Gurinder for projects allotted to him were more than the prescribed rates of the irrigation department.
