NEW DELHI: Northern Railway’s Delhi division has tied up with cab aggregator   to provide   from five major railway stations across the capital.

 The facility was launched at New Delhi, Old Delhi, Anand Vihar, Sarai Rohilla and Hazrat Nizamuddin railway stations on Tuesday, with dedicated Ola kiosks set up at the entrances of these stations.
 
 Railway officials said that this will improve help passengers in accessing transport from the railway stations with Ola representatives stationed at several points, allowing booking directly from the exit of the platform. 
 
 Officials said dedicated Ola zones have also been set up, providing one row of vehicles to the cab aggregator so that passengers would not have to travel a distance to reach their vehicles. The cars will include hatchbacks and sedans which can both be booked directly.
 
 “In addition, special Ola zones have been set up at each station with dedicated parking space. They have also been given pick up and drop points so that there is no congestion inside the railway stations. The idea is to improve the overall mobility experience at the railway stations,” said a senior railway official.
