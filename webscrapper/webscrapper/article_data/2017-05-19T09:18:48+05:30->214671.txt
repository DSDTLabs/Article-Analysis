AURANGABAD: As a part of pre-monsoon preparations, the   on Thursday announced that it will serve notices to owners of all the dilapidated buildings in the city. The municipal authorities will ask the property owners to demolish the dilapidated buildings on their own within a week else the civic body would execute the task and collect demolition charges and fine from the owners. 

 Ravindra Nikam, deputy commissioner, told TOI that the notices would be served within two days. “Initially, we will ask the concerned property owners to get rid of the dangerous structures on their own. But if they do not respond to the notice, we will swing into action,” he said. 
 
 In the recently held survey, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has identified 50 buildings that fall under the ‘unsafe category’. But the authorities are more concerned about the structures that fall under the high-risk category. “We will initiate action against all such structures, but our focus will be on   buildings as they are quite old and may prove hazardous for the human life,” said Nikam. 
 
 Nikam said that other buildings that are not so dangerous, but unsafe for the occupants would be sealed. 
 
 But sources in the municipal body told TOI that the civic body would issue notices only to complete a formality. “In the last two to three years, the municipal body has not demolished more than five buildings despite the fact that there are many high-risk category structures,” said the sources. 
 
 Most of the dilapidated buildings are located in Gulmandi, one of the densely populated commercial area. Some of the building are right in the heart of the market and may cause serious injuries to commuters.
