 I plan my day well ahead by making a list of to-dos to be ticked off by the EOD. Striking things off from the list ensures productivity. It sounds like a simple enough plan but it requires practice. Over the years, I’ve realised that the mind — like everything else in life — responds pretty well to training. It’s not the quantum of work that disrupts work-life balance; it’s the quantum of mind space involvement. Thus, planning is essential.
 
 
 
 A sound mind lives in a sound body. When your mind is calm and happy, your body will want to move, run, lift and be fit. Tracking the number of steps I take or following an app doesn’t work for me. 
 
 
 
 Our drive is a result of our passions, fears and excitement. I channelise this immense energy to work towards a clear goal. Happiness is not a destination; it is the best way to make use of the opportunities we have been given right here, right now. 
 
 
 
 Entrepreneurs, by design, are risk takers and I’m no exception. People around me are realists. They help me stay grounded. \
 
 
 
 It’s a philosophy that a person is comfortable living by. And every person in this world already has an understanding of what their personal philosophy is. 
 
 
 
 Ignoring both success and failure is the best way to handle both. I evaluate the situation, analyse what I could have done differently and move on.
 
 
 
 As Winston Churchill once said, ‘if you’re going through hell, keep going’. I just go through it and do what I have to do to fix it. If you don’t say “why me” when good things happen, don’t do it during a crisis. 
 
 
 
 When I have a few minutes to spare, I play a game. I see how long I can go without thinking about anything. It’s how I control and compartmentalise my thoughts (critical to achieve clarity).
