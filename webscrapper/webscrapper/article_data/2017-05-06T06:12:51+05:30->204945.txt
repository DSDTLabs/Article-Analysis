BHUBANESWAR: The state government on Friday decided to increase the monthly   of freedom fighters by Rs 4,000. The hiked amount will come into effect retrospectively from the month of April, according to a statement issued by the chief minister's office.

 There are nearly 250 freedom fighters who draw pension in the state. While 152 are covered by a state scheme, the rest get Rs 26,000 per month directly from the Centre under the   scheme and an additional Rs 4,000 from the state government.
 
 The increased amount of Rs 4,000 announced on Friday will be applicable to both state and central scheme beneficiaries, an official source said.
 
 The pension is presently given to people who directly participated in the freedom movement or in their absence, to their spouses or their dependant unmarried daughters. 
 
 Those jailed for more than 6 months fall under the central scheme. Pension provided by the state government are of three categories - Rs 6,000 to those jailed for less than 6 months, Rs 5,000 for those who participated in the freedom movement but did not go to jail and Rs 5,000 for those who took part in the Goa liberation movement. The government's sudden decision to raise the monthly pension of freedom fighters is seen here as an image makeover attempt by chief minister   in the backdrop of the April 15 function at   here, where Prime Minister   felicitated family members of freedom fighters and those who had taken part in the 1817 Paika movement.
