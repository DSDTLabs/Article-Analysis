AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday heard ex-BJP MP from Junagadh, Dinu Bogha Solanki and his nephew  , and reserved its decision for Tuesday on their objection to the CBI court’s decision to recall six witnesses in the   activist   in 2010.

 Dinu and Pratap alias Shiva Solanki approached the high court objecting to the CBI court’s order passed on April 7, in which the CBI court had recalled six witnesses. The accused persons have contended that the Supreme Court had ordered for re-examination of 26 witnesses and their deposition is over. The court could not have called more witnesses than those permitted to be re-examined by the apex court.
 
 CBI counsel R C Kodekar submitted that the CBI court has recalled six witnesses for clarification of the queries raised by itself. There is a provision under Section 311 of the CrPC that the court is empowered to recall any witness for the purpose of clarification.
 
 After hearing both the sides, Justice J B Pardiwala reserved order till Tuesday.
 
 On April 7, special CBI judge K M Dave summoned six witnesses for clarification mainly about the location of mobile phones. The court has summoned former investigator and IPS officer Raghavendra Vatsa, who had gathered call details, as well as four officials from four private service providers. All these five witnesses had deposed earlier before the court. But the court felt that the details which have come on record specify the tower IDs of mobile companies, and not exact locations from where calls made by the accused persons had originated and were received.
 
 Besides, the court has also summoned a witness from Junagadh RTO to know about the ownership of a car, which was used by accused   to travel to Gir Gadhda to pay Rs 11 lakh to co-accused Pachan Desai.
 
 After most of the witnesses had turned hostile during the trial, the HC had ordered a re-trial in this case. But the SC modified the order and ordered the trial court to re-examine 26 witnesses.
