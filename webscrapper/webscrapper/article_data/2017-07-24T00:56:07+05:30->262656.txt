NEW DELHI: A man, accused of raping his  , was acquitted by a   after the woman said their   were consensual and she had lodged the complaint as she was not paid her dues.

 Additional sessions judge Shail Jain was informed that the complaint was filed by the woman in a fit of rage with the reason being a monetary dispute. The woman, however, did not support the case and deposed before the court that physical relations established between her and the man were consensual.
 
 “Once the incident in question has been denied by the prosecutrix, no fruitful purpose would be served by examining the formal witnesses. Hence prosecution evidence was closed..,” observed the court.
 
 The case was lodged on the woman’s complaint which said that she had started working as a maid in the man’s house in west Delhi from October 2010. As a result of a matrimonial dispute between him and his wife, the wife had left the house.
 
 The maid alleged that on November 20, 2010, the man gave her a sedative-laced drink which made her unconscious, following which he raped her. She also alleged that the man recorded obscene videos and threatened to upload them on the internet if she disclosed the acts to anyone.
 
 “I am of the opinion that prosecution has not been able to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt that he had administered some intoxicated substance to the woman or that he had raped the prosecutrix or that he had threatened her of uploading her obscene videos on internet,” noted the court while acquitting the accused.
