Durga Krishna, a Kozhikode-based dancer, is on cloud nine as she bagged a dream debut as Prithviraj’s romantic interest in his upcoming film Vimanam.

 Directed by debutant Pradeep M Nair, the film is inspired by the real-life story of speech and hearing-impaired Saji M Thomas from Idukki.
  On choosing Durga for the role, the director says, “We had auditioned many and found Durga the best. She has the knack of getting into the skin of the character and has good acting skills.”
 
 Durga will be playing a village belle in the movie. He adds, “She is a simple girl who is full of life and will be seen wearing dhavani and skirt, reminiscent of yesteryears.” 
 
  Pradeep says that the lead couple’s love story is an important part of the film as the tagline says, ‘To fly was his dream... to love was his destiny.’
 “The movie has a passionate yet innocent love story woven into it. While the hero desires to fly, Cupid strikes,” Pradeep adds.
 
  Talking about her first few days of shoot, Durga says, “My happiness knows no bounds. I still can’t believe that I am actually playing Prithviraj’s heroine.”
  The shoot is currently happening in Kochi and the team will head to Mangalore next month.
