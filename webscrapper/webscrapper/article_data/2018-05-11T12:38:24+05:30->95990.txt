 in   is likely to sustain water supply demand for just over three weeks. The millennia old lake is barely 2-feet above its minimum level of pumping water.

 
  (BMC) officer   said that the water level on Thursday was at 1653.50 feet. The minimum level of drawing water is 1652 feet. Around the first week of April, water level in the Upper Lake was about 1655 feet, he said. 23 MGD of water is being drawn from the Upper Lake per day. It accounts to about 30% of city’s water supply demand. The declining water level is on account of less than average rainfall in the previous monsoon season.
 
 
 Urban development experts admit that the city is headed for water crisis. “Some rationalisation of water supply would be required in case of delay in arrival of monsoon. A final call would be taken next month,” said an official.
 
 Rapidly declining water level has also impacted the groundwater levels in the state capital.
 
 Going by the civic body estimates, many of the colonies in east of the city have overdrawn water from borewells.
 
 Narmada water supply distribution has been erratic in some areas during the current hot spell.
 
 Tapping groundwater in Bhopal has not been a conservative path.
 
 Various reports point to exploitation of groundwater. As per some estimates, groundwater has dipped by 3.5 metres on an average.
 
 421 sq km municipal corporation is under pressure to meet the demands. Mushrooming colonies across the city are drawing about 30 million litres of water from private underground wells. That has been one of the reasons for drop in aquafer levels.
