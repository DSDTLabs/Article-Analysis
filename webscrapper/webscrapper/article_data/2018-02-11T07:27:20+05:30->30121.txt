JAIPUR: CPI-M Politburo member Hanan Mollah, who is in charge of  , announced two major initiatives by the party in coming days in the state capital on Saturday. On February 22,   will gather in large numbers in Jaipur, converging in rallies from the four corners of the state. Four months after the state government promised loan waiver of up to Rs50,000 for farmers, nothing has been done, he said. Farmers will press for this waiver and draw attention to the dismal planning for the farm sector evident in the Union budget, which makes promises of hiking farm incomes but falls terribly short of making the required allocation, Mollah said.

 He said that across the country, between February 12 and 19, farmers will gather across the country to burn copies of the Union budget as a mark of protest. Mollah noted that the anti-people policies of the state government have earned it the loss in recent by-elections. Rajasthan has emerged as the “laboratory of communalism”. When members of the minority community are killed, whether Pehlu Khan, Umar Khan or Afrazul, culprits are allowed a long leash, he said.
 
 Mollah also noted that in Rajasthan, land is being acquired from farmers without offering them compensation as required under the Land Acquisition Act, 2013. Even the Niti Aayog report showed that Rajasthan ranked 20th among 21 states in the health index. Privatization was causing the deterioration of health and education sectors, in which ideally the government should invest more, he said.
 
 Mollah pointed out that although   national president Amit Shah and Prime Minister   assert that selling pakoras is a job, in Rajasthan, street side vendors are being pushed out of work in the name of the  . “Previously, the prime minister would travel abroad with his wife. These days, the prime minister takes along a capitalist and ensures that he negotiates a deal for them in each trip. It was Adani in Australia, Ambani in Germany and Tata in the UK.”
