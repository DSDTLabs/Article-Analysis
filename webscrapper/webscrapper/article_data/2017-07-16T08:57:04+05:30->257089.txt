AHMEDABAD: The authorities at   ( ) recently started work on beautifying the  . However, the basic infrastructure seems to have been forgotten, as potholes emerged on the runway for the second time in 12 days. The rain washed away the shoddy work on the runway and the bitumen surface developed patches, resulting in six outgoing and five arriving flights being delayed on Saturday.

 “Patches were reported on the runway during   at 8.30am. In view of aircraft safety, six arrivals were put on hold in the air under radar surveillance. It took 30 minutes to carry out the required repairs. About six arrivals were delayed by between 15 and 25 minutes. Five departures were also held up on the ground for around 20 minutes each. Operations (at SVPI) became normal again at 9am,“ Manoj Gangal, SVPI airport director, told ToI.
 
 Sources at the airport said the incident was caused by extremely poor runway re-carpeting work. “The runway re-carpeting was of extremely poor quality with zero accountability. The re-carpeting was to be complete by March 31 this year, but it was rushed through and finished by October 31last year, about six months ahead of time. One can thus gauge the quality of work done,“ said a source at SVPI airport.
