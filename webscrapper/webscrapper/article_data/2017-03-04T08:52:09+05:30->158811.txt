VADODARA: Young hockey players from across the city were in for a rude shock when they went to the hockey ground near Kalabhavan to do their routine practice on Friday. 

 The   (VMC) sealed the ground and blocked its entry from all directions citing non-payment of   by the   ( ). 
 
 The civic body has sent a bill of Rs 64.79 lakh to the BDHA and asked it to pay the arrears if it wants the academy at the ground to function again. 
 
 “The civic officials turned up at the ground without giving any prior notice. They simply sealed the ground and asked BDHA to pay the dues. From where will the hockey association bring such a huge amount?” questioned Sanjay Aerke, BDHA member and former coach. 
 
 He said that the VMC has applied commercial property tax rate for the ground. 
 
 “Ours is not a commercial activity. We just coach aspiring hockey players and, in fact, we don’t even charge any money from them. Most of the players here come from poor or middle-class background,” Aerke told TOI. 
 
 The civic body had sealed the BDHA’s office in 2013 over the same issue. “The ground belongs to royal Gaekwad family and is leased to our association. Sealing the ground like this will cause immense loss to the players. Many national players have played tournaments on this ground. The civic body should rethink about its decision,” Aerke added. 
 
 VMC deputy municipal commissioner R M Patel said that the tax for the ground was due since about five years. 
 
 “The properties that were sealed include the 800-square feet office and the 8,000-square feet ground,” said Patel. 
 
 He added that the tax for all playgrounds in the city were being assessed at commercial rates. Sources said that the amount of Rs 64.79 lakh that the association has been asked to pay also includes interest. 
 
 The VMC has come up with a scheme wherein it gives handsome rebates in the interest on tax.
