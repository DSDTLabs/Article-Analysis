Calangute: Deputy speaker and   MLA Michael Lobo on Wednesday said that the Candolim-Calangute beach-belt was in a messy state for a long time and with inadequate infrastructure thanks to former MLA Agnelo Fernandes and former Calangute sarpanch Joseph Sequeira.

 “I, through the North Goa Planning and Development Authority (NGPDA), am clearing the mess created by Joseph Sequeira and Agnelo Fernandes,” Lobo, who is also the NGPDA chairman, said on Wednesday. “In the last election, people had re-elected me after having seen the development undertaken by me in the last 5-6 years.” 
 
 Rejecting recent accusations by both Sequeira and Fernandes that the outline development plan is a huge money-making scam, Lobo said the Calangute-Candolim beach-belt has become a concrete jungle without proper roads and other basic public necessities because of Sequeira and Fernandes, who is also a former sarpanch of Candolim.tnn
