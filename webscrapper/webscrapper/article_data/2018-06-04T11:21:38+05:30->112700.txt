AGRA: Faced with severe fund crunch,   ( ) officials are planning to collect revenue from private players for granting permission to install transformers on government land.
 
  Sources said that AMC officials would kickstart a city-wide survey on Monday to locate transformers installed by builders or power distribution companies on government land. The land use fees would be determined depending on the pattern of usage, added sources.
  
  AK Singh, AMC executive engineer, said, “We have come to know that no charges are being levied for use of government land for installation of transformers by private players. Hence, we will conduct tax assessment and issue notices to the persons concerned. Also, penalty will be imposed on those who have encroached upon footpaths and other government land for placing transformers.”
  
  Meanwhile, AMC officials are also planning a crackdown on tax defaulters. This is as part of the civic body’s move to improve self-reliance and decrease the dependence on state funds.
