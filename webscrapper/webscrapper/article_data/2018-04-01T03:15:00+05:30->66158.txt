Panaji: Reacting to the crime branch’s closure report in the death of social activist   Dias, the petitioners have said they will fight back and are determined to take the case to its logical conclusion.

 “The closure of case filed for the second time by the crime branch is a step that we had pre-empted. Neither we are surprised nor clueless about the happenings in the forthcoming days.
