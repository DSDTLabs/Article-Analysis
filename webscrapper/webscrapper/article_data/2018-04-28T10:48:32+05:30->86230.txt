DHARAMSHALA:Moved by the death of 24 children from a private school in a bus accident on April 9, the school management wanted to shut down its operations, but the parents of children studying in the institute opposed the move as they didn’t want to opt for government  .

 According to parents, this was the only easily approachable private school at Malkawal area of Nurpur constituency in Kangra district.
 
 The school has been lying closed since April 9 when 24 students and four others died after the school bus rolled down deep gorge while on its way to drop children to their home.
 
 “We couldn’t muster courage to re-open the school. But parents of the children were not ready for the move. Though we had provided them transfer certificates too, they were adamant that we had to reopen the school,” said Sunita Kumari, principal of Wazir Ram Singh Pathania Private School.
 
 Around 170 students study in the school that has classes from nursery to Class X.
 
 The Nurpur SDM and block elementary officer had asked the school management to take the final call as the institute was lying closed for so many days. But when the management announced their move, the parents of the students gathered on the campus on Friday to oppose it.
 
 “There were several parents who jointly demanded that this school should not be closed. This all happened when the block elementary officer was also present in the school on Friday,” said Nurpur SDM Abid Hussain.
 
 Hussain has also asked the government schoolteachers in nearby areas of Malkwal to visit the families of the children who were studying in this school. They were asked to counsel them and make admissions of these children to government schools.
 
 But as the parents didn’t agree for the closure of the private school, the management sought three days to restart its operations in routine. Apart from the 24 children, three teaching and non-teaching staff members of the school were also killed in the accident.
