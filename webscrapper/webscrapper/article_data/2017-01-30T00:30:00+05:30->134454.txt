BENGALURU: The state cabinet on Saturday decided to table a bill in the upcoming joint session of the legislature, starting from February 6, to  , the   in coastal areas, and bullock- cart races held in different parts of the state.

 Law and parliamentary affairs minister T B Jayachandra said the bill could be tabled in the session to bring an amendment to The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. “Since the act comes under the concurrent list, the government does have powers to amend it but needs to get the President’s assent,’’ he added. 
 
 It means that those hoping to get quick legal relief to hold kambala and cart races may have to wait a bit.
 
 He said the cabinet gave its nod for the draft bill prepared by the department of animal husbandry after the majority of ministers agreed to legalise kambala and cart races since it involved social and religious sentiments of the people. “Some ministers suggested we include other forms of rural sport involving animals but that was not considered,’’ he added.
 
 He said they will, however, include certain guidelines to ensure animals are not harmed during the sport.
 
 Meanwhile, the matter pertaining to conduct of kambala will come up for hearing in the Karnataka High Court on January 30.
