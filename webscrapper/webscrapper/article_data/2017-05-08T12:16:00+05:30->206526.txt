COIMBATORE:   of the   on Friday handed over two   to the  . 

 The bicycles were designed by the students of mechanical engineering department as a part of an innovative project, said   R Rajaram. "They came up with the idea of designing an eco-friendly bicycle. We were glad about it as the Government of India is also supporting green energy initiatives." he told TOI. 
 
 After trying various prototypes, the students finally decided to use a battery-operated system to power the bicycle. "In the beginning, we used solar panels. But, the design was not driver-friendly. So, we decided to use rechargeable battery," said Rajaram.
 
 The bicycle runs at 25-30Kmph. "It takes 90minutes to recharge the battery. The bicycle can also be pedalled. While being pedalled, electricity is not utilised. There is an accelerator to increase the speed while using electricity-mode," said Rajaram.
 
 A group of students and staff of the college handed over two electric bicycles to the city police commissioner A Amalraj. 
 
 It cost them 25,000 to build a bicycle, said Rajaram, adding that the project was funded by the college management. 
 
 The students are now planning to develop more variants of the electric bicycle. 
 
 "We had removed many features to reduce cost. We will now focus on installing those features at an affordable cost. We also plan to develop battery-operated bikes and cars," Rajaram added.
