LUCKNOW: A day after he struck an alliance with the Samajwadi Party,   national vice-president   said on Sunday that what started as a spark during   and Phulpur bypolls will turn into a full blown opposition upsurge against the BJP in the   and Noorpur byelections in UP. 

 "The resentment against the ruling BJP has been growing. Earlier there was no option as the opposition was divided. But now, we are together and, therefore, it is time to say good bye to BJP," Chaudhary told TOI. On Saturday, SP chief   had agreed to back former BSP MP Tabbassum Beg as RLD candidate from Kairana. The RLD, in turn, agreed to support SP candidate Naimul Hasan in Noorpur. 
 
 Jayant, son of RLD chief Ajit Singh, said the alliance between the SP and the RLD would bring together Muslims and Jats who got divided after Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013. "The division benefited the communal forces like the BJP and its right wing associates. We can now hope that the differences between the communities would be bridged and they would come together to teach BJP a lesson," he said, adding that RLD was also seeking Congress's support.
 
 Jayant said the bypolls in west UP will resurrect his party which got decimated in 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 state polls. It drew a blank in 2014 while its lone MLA after 2017 polls, Sahendra Singh Ramala, has defected to BJP.
 
 Jayant has been campaigning in west UP for a month and had initially shown interest in contesting from Kairana, but, says dropped the idea for the sake of Opposition unity.
 
 Sources said that after SP announced fielding its candidate, Ajit Singh spoke to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and explained that RLD candidate would be able to garner more Jat votes . "Muslims would vote for a candidate even if it's backed by SP. So will Dalits who rallied behind SP candidates in Gorakhpur and Phulpur after BSP chief announced her support," said an RLD leader.
