Nagpur: Additional sessions judge GP Shirsat on Wednesday cancelled bail application of three more accused involved in Pench tiger poaching cases. Earlier, the court had cancelled bail of 13 accused. All the 16 accused are on the run.

 Overall 17 accused were arrested in poaching of five tigers in and around Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR) in June and July last year. While one accused Mahadeo Uikey died, other 13 were granted bail by Ramtek JMFC MS Banchare on September 1, and three thereafter on September 5.
 
 Of the 16 accused who were granted bail, 13 were released first. The forest department had challenged the Ramtek court’s order on September 4 in the sessions court at Nagpur. On September 22, the court cancelled bail of all 13 accused.
 
 These accused later moved the high court for relief but Justice AS Chandulkar upheld the sessions court order and rejected their bail. Since then, the accused are on the run.
 
 Last month, the forest department had challenged bail application of remaining three accused. The department’s special counsel Kartik Shukul argued that the sole ground on which these 3 accused were released on bail was that the other 13 accused have been released on bail. However, on Wednesday, the sessions court cancelled their bail considering various important parameters.
 
 Despite the high court rejecting bail of the accused from whom 15kg tiger bones, 80 whiskers and 15 claws were seized, no efforts are being made to arrest them.
 
 The five-member special investigating team (SIT) constituted by PCCF (wildlife) AK Misra under Pench field director Rishikesh Ranjan to streamline the poaching case has virtually become defunct.
 
 The team constituted on September 29 has not even met once in the last three months. Ranjan said, “Even if SIT has not met, we have made two attempts to nab the culprits. Unfortunately, women villagers were successful in helping some accused flee. Our attempt of not allowing accused to settle down is commendable.”
