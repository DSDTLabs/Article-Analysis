Imagine securing a lifetime of free rides in Uber cabs anywhere in the world.

 Sounds too good to be true? Well, it was a possibility but for Bengaluru-based security researcher,  , who found the bug that could have facilitated this and helped the taxi aggregator resolve it.
 
 Unfortunately, no free rides for us, but it secured Anand a bounty reward of $ 5,000 for detecting the security loophole.
 
 Anand, who is the first Indian to secure the first rank in  's 'White hat' hackers list, keeps a tab on various application for any bug that might have crept in.
 
 This particular bug that Anand unearthed in Uber app would have led to misuse by 'black-hat' hackers (unethical hackers), who in turn could have made changes in the application which would have facilitated free rides for those who could have exploited the loophole.
 
 Anand said that the bug may not have been easily replicated by common users, but with a little knowledge of technicalities and coding, one could have availed free rides. After taking the required permissions from Uber, Anand disclosed the bug that would have allowed invalid payment method after a ride. He displayed the flaw in the service app both in US and India.
 
 "Once the ride starts, the user needs to specify the payment method. The bug allowed an invalid payment method to be added into the options helping one ride for free," Anand explained speaking to Bangalore Mirror.
 
 The bug was such that the user while specifying the payment method (Paytm, credit or debit card etc) could have easily added an invalid code as bizarre as 'abc or 'XYZ' and it would have been accepted as a valid payment method by the app, and the passenger would get a free ride.
