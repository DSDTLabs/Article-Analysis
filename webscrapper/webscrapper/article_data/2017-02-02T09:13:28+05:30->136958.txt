LUCKNOW: The Union Budget has proposed to create an innovative fund for secondary  ,   and quality improvement. The fund will be used to set up a career counselling and guidance centre for students in UP, said innovation head for secondary education  . 

 The scheme will focus on educationally backward blocks (EBBs). UP has about 74% such blocks. In an EBB, female literacy is below the national average, while the gap between male-female literacy is above the national average. 
 
 Pandey said students are often confused about which stream to choose in class XI. In the absence of proper guidance, many drop out after class X. So, dropouts need be informed about ITIs where they can get skill-based training, he added. 
 
 “Also, some students need psychological counselling. The centre would prove helpful for such students,” said Pandey. 
 
 In 2016-17, UP had received Rs 3.5 crore from the Central government for innovation under Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan. The money, said Pandey, was spent on two major innovations: English speaking programme for class IX students in 300 government schools, and remedial classes for weak children of class IX in 600 government schools. 
 
 For 2017-18, UP has to send its annual work plan and budget by February 16. The meeting between UP and central government officials is scheduled on March 2.
