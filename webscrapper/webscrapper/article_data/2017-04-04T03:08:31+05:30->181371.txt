Residents of   VII Phase gathered at the 22-acre  , which is off  , on Sunday to clear it of the garbage that has, over time, been dumped on the bed of the lake. The aim of the event was to get locals involved in   of the waterbody which, like many others in the city, has been hit by massive urbanization.
 
  It all began in June 2016 when residents launched a fund-raising drive, the funds of which would go towards reviving the lake. Not waiting for the   to pitch in with assistance, the residents themselves decided to go ahead with their plans after having raised Rs 30,000.
  
  At the end of the day, a truckload of garbage was picked from the lake. The drive was spearheaded by Friends of Chunchugatta in collaboration with the NGO, Youth for Parivarthan.
