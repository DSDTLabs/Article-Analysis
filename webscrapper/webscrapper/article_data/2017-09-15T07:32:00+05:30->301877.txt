Jalandhar: Volunteers of Sikh group Khalsa Aid on Thursday started langar for Rohingya refugees reaching Teknaf — the southernmost town of Bangladesh. On the first day, they prepared food for over 30,000 people and distributed it in packets among the refugees.

 The Sikh NGO’s volunteers had reached Bangladesh on September 9 and started distributing bottled water, biscuits and bread among the beleaguered Rohingya refugees, who fled Myanmar, the very next day. They had also applied for permission from the local authorities for organising the langar. After getting the same from the local authorities they purchased the material required for it and started serving the langar on Thursday. “A local resident provided us with fuel for cooking the food and we started distribution of packets at the camping site of the refugees in the afternoon,” said Amarpreet Singh, managing director, Khalsa Aid, India.
 
 A few local volunteers are also helping them in preparing and distributing the food. On the first day they prepared vegetable biryani. “We have made purchases for a week and plan to continue the relief work for a longer time,” he quipped. Accompanied by Jiwanjot Singh of Jammu and Kashmir, Amarpreet added that eight more volunteers from India would be joining them on Saturday. He added that this would increase their workforce and they would be able to serve more people.
 
 Meanwhile, along with Sikhs, people from other communities have also started donating money for extending relief to the Rohingyas. A special page started by Khalsa Aid reflected that by Thursday afternoon over £ 25,000 were raised for the cause.
