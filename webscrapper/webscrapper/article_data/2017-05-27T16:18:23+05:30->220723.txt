Bijnor: Is Bijnor beggar-free? On papers it is, but the ground reality is very different. Take a trip to any part of the district and you will find hundreds of them by the roadside, outside temples and in busy markets. Interestingly, beggars are also seen outside government offices like Vikas Bhawan and collectorate.  According to the government provisions, if any beggar is found in the city, he will be provided with benefits of government schemes and will be entitled to a BPL card.    While the district officials claim that there are no beggars in Bijnor, the reality is something very different. Hundreds of women with children in their laps are seen on traffic signals. “I have four kids to look after but do not have a house or a means to earn money. I live with my family at the railway station,” said a female beggar outside Vikas Bhawan.    Nrapendra Deshwal, a resident of Geeta Nagari, said, “A large number of beggars are part of the profession. They come with their children and beg door-to-door. The administration is not paying attention.”       When TOI contacted chief development officer Indramani Tripathi, he said, “Begging is banned here. There is no beggar in the district on papers. However, I am planning to conduct a survey of beggars and if any of them is found, we will rehabilitate them and will give them benefits of government schemes so that they do not beg in future. We will also provide them employment under MNREGA and other schemes.”    On being asked about the matter, district probation officer Sudhansu Shekkhar claimed that there is no beggar in Bijnor district.
