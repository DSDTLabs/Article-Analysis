BEGUSARAI: Unidentified motorcycle-borne criminals shot the owner of a packaged drinking water plant in broad daylight at   under   police station on Monday. The incident occurred when the owner, Sanjiv Kumar alias Laddu Lal, was busy with some work at his plant. 

 Police sources said, three criminals riding a motorcycle arrived at the manufacturing unit and opened fire. Sanjiv sustained gunshot injury in his abdomen and fell unconscious. 
 
 Police sources said, according to one of the plant workers, who was present on the spot, he had first suspected the firing by criminals as sound of some cracker. However, on seeing Sanjiv lying in a pool of blood he raised an alarm. The criminals by then had escaped from the scene leaving the motorcycle behind.
 
  SP Aditya Kumar said Sanjiv was immediately rushed to a private hospital where he succumbed to injuries. “The reason behind his murder could not be ascertained immediately but prima facie it appears that it was because of some property dispute,” said the SP adding, “We have got some lead about the criminals and we also expect some breakthrough very soon.”
