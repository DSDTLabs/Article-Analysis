PURULIA: A man found guilty of rape, accepted the victim's eight-year-old demand of marrying her. On trial court's order, both got married inside the Purulia jail on Wednesday. He was convicted on December 29. 

 The accused Monoj Bauri(30), was first arrested in 2010, two months after the victim had a son and convicted Bauri of cheating. Since conceiving the child, the victim had been asking Bauri to marry her. 
 
 The woman said, "I could not admit my son to any school because I was unable to furnish official papers of his father's identity."
