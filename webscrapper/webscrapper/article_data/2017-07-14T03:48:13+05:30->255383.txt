Security agencies went into overdrive following a   station on Thursday. No explosive was found and train services were not affected.

 “An unverified phone call was received on RPF control room at 10.44am regarding a bomb being planted at Churchgate station. Personnel from the   (GRP) and   (RPF) conducted checks inside trains and on station areas. The canine squad was also roped in. The Anti-Terrorism Squad was alerted,” said an official. Security agencies are trying to trace the caller.
 
  chief public relations officer Ravinder Bhakar said, “The bomb call was taken seriously in wake of the Amarnath killings and also because it’s the sixth anniversary of the triple blasts at Zaveri Bazaar, Opera House and Dadar.” On July 13, 2011, three blasts left 26 people dead and over one hundred injured. 
 
 “We have called in for reinforcements from other RPF posts and everybody is on high alert along the WR section,” said a senior RPF official at Churchgate. “We came across two abandoned bags, but they had clothes and medicines,” the official said, adding that the teams were asked to stay put at the station till evening peak hours. Security agencies on the CR were also asked to stay alert.
