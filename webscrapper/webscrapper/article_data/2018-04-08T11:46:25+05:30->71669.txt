 "I make it my mission every single time I step on the stage that no matter what, no matter where I am, I want to make you feel everything you could possibly feel. I want you to feel sad, mad, happy and nostalgic and really pissed sometimes. That's my favourite," Lambert told the audience.
 
 "And part of feelings is also heartbreak unfortunately, but fortunately for me, I can use it for my art or whatever. I like to write sad songs. I like to listen to sad songs, so I want to sing y'all one," she added and then performed her hit  , an emotional song about heartache.
 
 As for East, the 29-year-old performed a song about love and loss when appearing on a syndicated radio show in February.
