 A Telibagh medical store Abhinav Kapoor told TOI that a widely used blood-pressure control tablet is limited in stock. “I used to order 20 tablets, after every five days, as it is a most commonly used medicine but since July 1, have not received any order from the wholesaler and I am left with only two tablets now,” said Kapoor. 
 
 In  , medical store owner Pawan Lalwani said, “A commonly used sugar-control tablet has not been available since July 1 and for my customers, I had to borrow stock from another store.”
 
 Medicine wholesalers blamed pharmaceutical companies for not sending stock after GST was implemented. Wholesaler Sanjay Jaiswal said, “We receive 100 orders for syringes, intravenus sets from all over the city, including from hospitals but since July 1 the pharmacy companies have stopped delivering these products.

If the conditions continue to remain the same, it might lead to crisis and panic among customers. Udyog Vyapaar Mandal vice president Puneet Sharma, who also is the one of the largest wholesale dealers of medicine and medical products told TOI, that stocks of many   are limited and companies are not sending new stock for lack of clarity in prices of medicines. “The government should have thought about introducing GST in medicines properly and to keep things simple, it should have reduced prices directly instead of imposing the new tax,” said Sharma.
