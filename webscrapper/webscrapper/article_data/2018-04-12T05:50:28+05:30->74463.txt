UNNAO: The SIT constituted to probe the rape charges against BJP   Kuldeep Sengar has seized an audio clip in which the legislator is allegedly asking the survivor’s uncle to settle their differences.

 
 SIT chief Rajeev Krishna said the police have accessed all material, including the audio clips, and are analysing them.
 
 The clip begins with Sengar’s question: “What are you doing these days? Why are you getting pamphlets published against me? It’s been running for more than six months.”
 
 “I have not got them printed,” the girl’s uncle is heard saying. The MLA is then heard asking the man if he considers himself as a younger brother or not.
 
 “Yes I am. I received the pamphlet on WhatsApp. But I am not some Hanuman that I can tear myself apart and prove it,” the uncle says. The two men then discuss the criminal FIRs, while accusing each other of registering them on “manufactured” complaints. The girl’s uncle repeatedly refers the legislator as “daddu”. “Maine bhookhe rehke aapki sewa ki. Jahan aapne khada kiya, main waha khada hua (I have stayed hungry to serve you. I have followed your instructions),” the uncle says.
 
 The MLA then appeals to the girl’s uncle to end their differences and move forward. He says that he would ask his younger brother Atul to apologise to the girl’s uncle. “Ab humari tumhari baat hui, koi beech mai nahi rahega. Atul tumhare sage hain. Maine kaha Atul tumhare samne galti mangenge aur humare tumhare parivar ek hoke rahenge (Our families will live like one and my brother will apologise to you),” the MLA says. 
 
 He then offers to call their family over tea. The phone call then ends.
