HYDERABAD: A total 1,553 private colleges out of 2,452 applied for affiliations with the   (TSBIE) as on Friday. 

 The TSBIE has tightened the affiliation process this year following the   incident wherein the institute functioned without seeking affiliation from the intermediate board. “We have received thousands of online applications seeking affiliations this year. The last date for applying was extended to May 13 after which we will conduct inspections and issue affiliations,” said  , joint secretary of academics at TSBIE. 
 
 Incidentally, the board has received higher number of applications this year with the   government contemplating on conducting online applications.
 
 While the TSBIE officials are awaiting orders from the Telangana government over conduct of online admissions, the affiliation process shall run simultaneously. “If the admissions are conducted online, only affiliated colleges will participate in the admission process. Students will be able to access credentials of each college and will not fall prey to unaffiliated colleges as it happened in the   case,” explained Reddy. 
 
 This year, the TSBIE also increased the inspection and affiliation fee by nearly 300 percent. However, the Telangana Private Junior College Managements Association flayed the board’s decision to hike inspection and affiliation fees without increasing the tuition fees of the students. 
 
 Since college managements are functioning purely on scholarships and fee reimbursement, members of the association urged that the board increases the tuition fees from existing Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 in science groups in municipal corporations, Rs 15,000 to Rs 18,000 in municipalities and Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000 in grama panchayats.
