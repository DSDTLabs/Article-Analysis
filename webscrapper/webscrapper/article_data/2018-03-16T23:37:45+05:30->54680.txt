Chandigarh: Illegal garbage dumping by Kansal and Nayagaon villagers in Chandigarh land behind Chandigarh Club in Sector 3 is back to square one in less than 24 hours from mayor Davesh Modgil’s visit on Thursday to get it cleaned.

 Residents of Khuda Ali Sher had been facing problems for long due to unhygeinic surroundings. They complained that the villagers of Kansal and Nayagaon diposed of their garbage on the Chandigarh land which emanated foul smell. Following this complaint, Moudgil, along with MC officials, visited the site and got it cleaned.
 
 During a visit to the site on Friday morning, it was found that the garbage vehicles of Punjab were dumping waste at the site, even after Moudgil’s instruction to discontinue this practice. The stray cattle and ragpickers were also adding to the woes, by spreading garbage all over the place. This thus rendered the Thursday’s cleaning exercise futile.
 
 Mayor said that he also called the area supervisor of Kansal, Punjab, to find out why the residents of Punjab are dumping their garbage in Chandigarh.
 
 On this, the officials of Kansal informed Moudgil that Punjab government have allocated a land in the area, which was taken on lease of Rs 1.5 crore and soon, the dumping and segregation of garbage, will start on that land. Mayor instructed the supervisor of Kansal that they should keep a check on illegal dumping of garbage.
 
 In the dock:
 
 It is strange that in less than 24 hours, garbage is back on the land that was cleared on Thursday. This has happened even after the area supervisor of Kansal was asked to dispose of this garbage in the land earmarked by Punjab, instead of the Chandigarh land. I will take up the issue with the Punjab authorities to get it resolved at the earliest.
