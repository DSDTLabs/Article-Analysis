PONDA: Alleviating fears in the minds of mariners, the roads division of the public works department (PWD) has claimed that navigating below the ruins of the   is safe.

 The official has clarified that the collapsed span lies about 26m deep and the local river vessels could hardly be six-metre deep.
 
 A section of the ruined metallic   bridge on River Zuari collapsed in February and a team from the Captain of Ports recently inspected the site for possible threats to mariners, Nivruti Parcekar, an assistant engineer of the team, said. The team has reported that the span cannot pose a danger to any vessel
 
 The first bridge was built during the Portuguese era some time in 1933. It is said that the bridge was closed for traffic in the 1980s after it was destabilized following a barge crashing into one of its piers. 
 
 The bridge serves as the only link between   and   talukas, and despite the opening of a new bridge for traffic, the metallic bridge has not been dismantled.
 
 The ruins have also proved fatal as there were some incidents of commuters moving on the old bridge and accidentally falling into river. 
 
 Though none got hurt during the collapse, it can further crumble as two more spans are hanging on by dilapidating pillars.
 
 Parcekar said that the Captain of Ports has assured all measures to bring the collapsed span out of the water. But people fear that another span may collapse in the meantime. Locals are demanding the government should act swiftly to avert any possible mishap.
