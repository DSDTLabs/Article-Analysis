Love will find a new meaning with Colors’ first launch of 2017, ' '. The story of Parth ( ),   ( ) and their entwined destinies with   (Jasmin Bhasin) promises to showcase human emotions connected with love and togetherness. The makers of the show, which premieres tonight at 10.30 pm, tells us why they believe 'Dil Se Dil Tak' is a must-watch...

 A lovable pairing: Sidharth and Rashami are making their comeback with this drama. Rushes of the show have given a glimpse of their sizzling on-screen chemistry. The many highs of Parth and Shorvori’s romance will create some heartwarming relationship goals for many 
 couples.
 
 A twist in the love story: While the show traces the highs and lows in Parth and Shorvori’s marriage, there will be an unexplainable twist in their love story in the form of Teni. A typical Gujarati girl, her fate will be tied to Parth and Shorvori’s. This untagged relationship makes the story an interesting watch for audiences.
 
 Dilchasp rishtey: In life, we experience certain relationships that bring us happiness, but they may remain unacknowledged. 'Dil Se Dil Tak' consciously identifies one such dilchasp rishta which unites three souls — Parth, Shorvori and Teni — through one common thread. Their relationship, though unnamed, ties their fate in a way that not only creates complications, but also resolves some unforeseen circumstances.
 
 Tying together two contrasting worlds: The story is set against the traditionally rich Gujarati backdrop. But, the heart of the show lies in a cross-cultural love story fostered between a Gujarati boy, Parth, and the love of his life Shorvori, a Bengali girl. Their cultural differences lead to unexplainable complications within their family.
