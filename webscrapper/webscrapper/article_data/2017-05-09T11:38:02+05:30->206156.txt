PUNE: The city may witness a second spell of showers any time, the Met department said on Monday while forecasting   over  ,   and Marathwada on all the days till May 12.

  has received only 0.2mm rainfall from March to May 8. As per the department,   are expected over the city during the next two days, followed by rain and thundershowers till May 14.
 
 This may bring down Pune’s night temperature, officials from the department said. “The day temperature may not register any significant drop as the showers may occur only in the evening,” they added.
 
 The officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said large-scale weather systems are not responsible for the thunder clouds and rain, which are a result of convective heating and moisture availability. “In fact, rain over Madhya Maharashtra, south Konkan and Marathwada over the next few days may only be the result of convective heating, as temperature in these regions has been on the higher side. However, from May 11, we also expect some weather systems that will aid this phenomenon and trigger rains,” they said.
 
 Though the city’s temperature has peaked several times over the past couple of months, it took some time for convective clouds to form, the officials said. “Whenever heating peaks, the atmosphere reacts and a low-pressure area starts building. Moisture then starts feeding into the low-pressure area. As the heating builds up gradually, it results in convective rains,” an IMD official said.
 
 Meanwhile, city’s maximum and minimum temperatures stayed at 39.1°C and 21°C, respectively on Monday.
