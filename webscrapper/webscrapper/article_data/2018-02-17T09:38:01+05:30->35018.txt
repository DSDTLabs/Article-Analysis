 president   described   government's second budget as a heap of promises and targets. He said the budget tabled on Friday lacked clarity on how it will improve the life of a common man. 

 Pointing out the high debt liability of 29.8% against the state GDP,   questioned the  's claim of going ahead with the development agenda. 
 
 "The high fiscal deficit will also pose a big challenge for the state government in getting the projects and schemes implemented," he said. Akhilesh said that in its election manifesto the BJP had promised all round development, but all those assurances now appear to be a mirage. 
 
 The Yogi government has not proposed any concrete policy for crime control even as incidents of crime against women are rising, SP chief said, adding that there was no plan on providing jobs to unemployed youth. 
 
 "The BJP government only talks of start-ups and offers nothing to meet the target of employment to 70 lakh youths in the next five years that they had promised," Akhilesh said, adding that no allocation has been made for prime minister's health insurance scheme which was supposed to benefit 1.6 crore families in the state. 
 
 He also reminded the BJP government of its promise to distribute laptops and questioned its silence on the issue in the budget.
