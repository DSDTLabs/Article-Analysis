Allahabad: Chaos ensued at the Allahabad University campus on Saturday as the students continued to protest demanding the removal of the director of the admissions committee and the resignation of vice-chancellor RL Hangloo. Though the university was closed because of the weekend, yet the momentum of the agitating students did not die down. 

 The students shouted slogans against the VC and even protested at the university’s Union hall half naked. President of AU student union, Rohit Mishra, said, “Our slogan is ‘kulpati bhagao-university bachaao ( remove the VC and save AU)’. We will not allow Prof Hangloo to enter the campus when the university opens on Monday.” 
 
 Vice-president of AUSU, Adil Hamza, said, “A student immolated himself because of the dictatorial attitude of the AU administration. Now the student community would fight till the end so that no other student is forced to take such an extreme step.” 
 
 The protesting students also performed a yajna at the Union hall for the well -being of Jabir Raza, the student who set himself on fire on February 9 and is currently undergoing treatment at a government hospital in Delhi. 
 
 The agitating students have called a meeting of students at Union hall at 11am on February 12 to decide the the future course of action. 
 
 The students are protesting against the director of admissions commitee, who is facing charges of financial irregularities.
