'The Exorcist' director   is working on a feature-length documentary based on exorcism. Titled 'The Devil and Father Amorth', the documentary will explore how the moments in Friedkin's classic film compares to actual exorcisms.

 More than four decades after the release of the 1973 horror movie, Friedkin received permission to attend an exorcism performed by Father  , who is known as the "Dean of Exorcists," having performed thousands of exorcisms. Friedkin witnessed the ninth exorcism on an Italian woman who had been experiencing troubling fits and behavioural changes that psychiatry apparently could not fix. 
 
 "I've never stopped being fascinated by the nature of good and evil, and the possibility of demonic possession. The opportunity for me to witness and film an actual exorcism came about, more than four decades after I made 'The Exorcist', completely by accident," Friedkin said.
