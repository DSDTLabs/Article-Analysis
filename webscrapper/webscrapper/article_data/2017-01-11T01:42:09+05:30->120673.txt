NAVI MUMBAI: The civic administration is seeking feedback from residents about its proposal to address the problems of unmaintained   and uneven  .

 The engineering department has proposed having uniform levels and width for the footpaths. The height and width will be as per Indian Road Congress (IRC) norms—1.8m wide and 4 to 6 inches high.
 
 The administration also wants to implement an annual   contract for road repairs and maintenance.
 
 “We have tried to work out all possible solutions for these issues. If there are any aspects, which we have overlooked or could be solved differently, then public’s suggestions are welcome,” said an official from the engineering department.
 
 According to the aims, objectives and goals of the proposal, the administration wants the footpaths to be friendly for disabled and senior citizens. They also plan to integrate other features like zebra crossings. They will also install bollards to prevent vehicles from using footpaths.
 
 “The administration should get the concept implemented, mere proposal won’t help,” said activist  . 
 
 By giving an annual contract, the civic body wants to ensure that maintenance and repairs were done within the stipulated time. 
 
 The administration plans to fill up potholes within three days, trenches to be reinstated within a week and minor footpath repairs to be done within three days. “The contracting agency will be fined if it failed to complete the work in time,” said a civic official. He added that tender bids would have to be called for every work tender bids, which is lengthy process. 
 
 Kedarnath Ghorpade, ex-urban planner of MMRDA, has commended the administration’s efforts to seek public opinion. “The ongoing initiative is part of public space management, where local views are important. Administration is required to have a clear idea of land use, the activity on the space and optimizing it’s utilization before implementing both the proposals,” he said. —Sameera Kapoor Munshi
