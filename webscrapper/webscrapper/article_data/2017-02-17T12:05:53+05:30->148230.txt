MADURAI: AIADMK cadres supporting the faction led by   K Palaniswami celebrated the governor’s choice of chief minister on Thursday by distributing sweets and bursting crackers in the southern districts including Madurai, Virudhunagar and Tuticorin. However, efforts of   activists to burn a photograph of Palaniswami near the Periyar bus terminal were thwarted by the police. 

 Soon after news of the governor inviting te Palaniswami went viral, party cadre gathered at various places including the AIADMK party office near Goripalayam, Mattuthavani and Periyar as well as Thirumangalam and Melur on the outskirts. They raised slogans praising former chief minister J Jayalalithaa and Sasikala and against former chief minister O Panneerselvam. They distributed sweets to the road users too. 
 
 Justifying the governor’s invitation to Palaniswami, advocate   said “The uncertainty that has been prevailing so far has gone away. Now, we hope to see better administration in the government.” 
 
 Meanwhile, members of the Adhi Thamilar Peravai gathered near the   statue near Periyar bus terminal and made a vain attempt to burn a picture of Palaniswamy. Justifying their action, they claimed coming across a video clipping recently in social media which showed Palaniswami beating a dalit policeman for his failure to salute him. 
 
 Thideernagar police asked them to move away from the spot. As they refused, they arrested four people and registered a case against them under section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC. They were released in the evening.
