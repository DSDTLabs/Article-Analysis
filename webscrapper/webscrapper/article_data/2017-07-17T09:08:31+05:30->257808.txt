MOHALI: No   have been found on the   used to kill a 40-year-old businessman whose   in a major development that could weaken the case against the prime suspect -the wife of the victim.

 A forensic report has said there are no clear fingerprints on the weapon that the police claimed was recovered from the room where Aikom Singh Dhillon was shot dead in his house in Phase 3B1 on March 19. The pistol is licensed in the name of Seerat Kaur, the victim's wife and main accused.
 
 The report has, although, confirmed the bullet which killed Dhillon was fired from the pistol. “One bullet was fired from the pistol, while one was still in the chamber and the weapon was cocked,“ the police charge-sheet stated while quoting the report.
 
 The murder had come to light when Seerat along with a friend was transporting the body packed in a suitcase in a BMW car parked outside her house on March 20. An autorickshaw driver she had asked for help noticed blood oozing from the suitcase and informed the police. Cops arrested Seerat, who could now benefit from the missing fingerprints. But investigators believe they have a watertight case against her.
 
 Senior superintendent of police Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “Seerat killed Dhillon from a point blank range. Our case will not weaken. In many cases we don't get fingerprints on murder weapons. The accused was caught with the body .We have named 56 witnesses to be cross-examined during the trial.“ The case is based on circumstantial evidence. But police feel Seerat's confession of having killed Aikom will be enough to convict her.
