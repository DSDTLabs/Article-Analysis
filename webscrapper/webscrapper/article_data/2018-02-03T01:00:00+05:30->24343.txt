Indo-Canadian singer   is on a roll these days! After having earned several records and lending voice to a number of songs that went on to become chart-busters in last two years in films like 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil', 'Dangal', 'Pad Man' and 'Ok Jaanu', among others, the young singer is coming back to the independent music scene. While Jonita was quite popular online from her rendition of hit Bollywood songs, the song she has chosen with which to return to the indie scene is quite unique. The singer is teaming up with   for an EDM (Electronic dance music) track titled ' '. Considering the fact that EDM is more about the music and less about vocals, will the track allow her to exercise her vocal chords? She replies, “There are many elements that can go into an EDM track, and I think with 'Castles' we have presented something that's beyond just 'the beats'. I like experimenting with as many genres as I can, so working on this collab with Anish was exciting for me.”

 So, will the 2017   be coming up with an independent album anytime soon? “Maybe,” she replies, adding, “I'd love to work on some singles of my own and release an EP - but probably a little later in the future.”
