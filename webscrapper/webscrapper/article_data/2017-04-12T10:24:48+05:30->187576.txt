BENGALURU: India's non-playing captain   is aiming to take a fullstrength squad to the Davis Cup World Group playoffs against Canada (September 15 to 17). As the two nations have never met in the competition, it was decided by draw of lots that Bhupathi's side would play away. The Mumbai-based 42-year-old, who had tuned in to watch the draw being held in London, said he was hoping for a home tie, but given that "we're in the World Group playoffs, we could've drawn a lot worse."

 While it was too early to be wondering who'll play from either side, he said, his team which beat Uzbekistan 4-1 in Bengaluru in the weekend was back in the mix of competition. Bopanna is in Morocco playing alongside Poland's   with whom he made the final in Dubai while Ramanathan Ramkumar, Prajnesh Gun neswaran and Sriram Balaji are scheduled to play Challengers in the United States, Taipei and China in the coming weeks.
 
 "Five months is a long time. I'm looking to go with a full-strength team. Yuki (Bhambri) should be back in competition in a week or two, Saketh (Myneni) will take another month to get back into action. It will also depend on who Canada will field," Bhupathi, who had a winning debut as captain, said.
 
 Canada without Milos Raonic were bo unced out of the first round of the World Group in February when teenager Denis Shapovalov's wild strike hit the chair umpire, who later needed facial surgery. But even without the World No.6 Raonic, Canada have four players ranked between 100 and 200 Â­   (119),   (127), Shapovalov (172),   (179).
