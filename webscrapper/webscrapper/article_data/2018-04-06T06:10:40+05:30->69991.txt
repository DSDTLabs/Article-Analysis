COIMBATORE : Two elderly women who fell sick after they consumed prasadam from a temple at Nadar Colony near   in Mettupalayam died on Thursday afternoon. Thirtyseven others who too consumed the prasadam on Tuesday evening are being treated at the government hospital in Mettupalayam.

 The dead were identified as S  , 60, and  , 60, both from Nadar Colony near Mahadevapuram in Mettupalayam. They were daily wagers. The police said authorities of the Selvamuthu Mariamman temple had arranged ‘Poochattu Vizha’ on Tuesday evening.
 
 Earlier in the day, Ganapathi homam was performed at the temple and devotees were offered prasadam that comprised aval (flattened rice), pori (puffed rice), sugar and ghee. More than 40 devotees consumed the prasadam and attended the Pooachattu Vizha. Later, they developed vomiting and diarrhoea. Thirty-seven people were taken to hospital on Wednesday.
 
 Ghee used in prasadam was not meant for consumption
 
 Savithri and Loganayagi, who also fell sick, did not take treatment. Their health condition deteriorated on Thursday and they died at home. Neighbours informed the Mettupalayam police, who came to the spot and sent the bodies for postmortem.
 
 C N  , inspector of police, Mettupalayam told TOI that a team of doctors from the Mettupalayam government hospital checked the labels of the ghee boxes and found that it was not suitable for consumption. It was to be used only to light lamps.
 
 “Doctors told us that the ghee is the main reason for the devotees developing vomiting and diarrhoea. It is not suitable for consumption. The temple authorities mistakenly used the ghee with prasadam and some employees of the temple also developed similar symptoms and are being treated at the hospital,” said Chennakesavan. Police said Loganayagi’s elder sister   and younger brother  , 58, are undergoing treatment at the hospital.
 
 They said the exact cause of death will be known only after the postmortem report.
