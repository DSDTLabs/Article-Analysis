Yet another star sibling is making a tinsel town entry in Malayalam and this time, it is  's younger brother Askar. In the movie titled Honey Bee 2.5,   plays an aspiring actor named Vishnu, who visits the sets of Honey Bee 2 requesting a chance to act in films. The movie is directed by Shaiju and scripted by Lal, and is parallelly shot alongside Honey Bee 2, directed by Jean Paul Lal.

 Askar says, 'My character hails from a village and wishes to make it big as an actor. He keeps visiting a bevy of directors from time to time and finally lands on the sets of Honey Bee 2, requesting a chance. Funny instances ensue, with actors trapping Vishnu in jest, ragging him on the sets and more.' Kattappanayile Rithwik Roshan fame Lijo Mol is his love interest in the movie.
 
 Earlier, actor Lal had revealed to us that Honey Bee 2.5 is an experimental movie, and that the film is about an incident that happens on the sets of Honey Bee 2.
  The youngster had offers coming in even before, as his brother is part of the industry. Askar says he felt bold enough to pick this role as Lal gave him the confidence to take it up. He recalls, 'I had never acted before, but was always interested in films. After finishing my college, I headed to Chennai and was there for a year. I decided to pick this role as Lal uncle gave me the confidence to do it.'
 
 His isn't a heavy-duty role with lengthy dialogues, Askar adds. 'Lal uncle also said that I don't have to learn any lines by rote, and should just understand the character and casually present my lines. As my brother will also be on the sets always, I decided to say yes to the project.'
 
 Ask him how Asif is helping him out, and Askar says, 'He doesn't give my much of advice and just gives me instructions on how to conduct myself on the sets, mostly. All he told me was this, 'If you like the projects coming your way, take them, the rest would be your fate. I don't have much advice to offer'.'
