BENGALURU: With hospitals witnessing 20 to 60 positive cases a day, the   scare seems to have gripped Bengaluru. A total of 2,193 positive dengue cases have been reported across government hospitals in   in the past seven months. For Bengaluru, the figure stands at 52. According to BBMP records, private hospitals in the city have seen a staggering 1,389 confirmed dengue cases since January.

 Shockingly, health department records have no mention of the recent dengue death (July 6) in the city. While   authorities have confirmed that dengue claimed the 14-year-old girl’s life, the health department report accessed by TOI reads: “There have been zero dengue deaths in the city as well as the state”. 
 
 The maximum cases have been recorded in Mysuru (256), followed by Mandya (213), Udupi (195) and Davanagere (181). 
 
 Doctors are also seeing adults with dengue-like symptoms, with some even requiring hospitalization. Dr Prakash Kumar BG, deputy director,   (NVBDCP), said: “ The Karnataka House Index Survey conducted by NVBDCP shows that 10% of the households in cities like Bengaluru, Mysuru, Tumakuru and Chikkamagaluru have potent mosquito-breeding sources within homes, which increases the dengue risk. We have a rapid response team of dedicated and trained officials in urban areas, who with the help of local corporators, NGOs and nursing students are conducting surveys to locate mosquito-breeding spots in houses and and get rid of them.” 
 
 Speaking on the rapid rise of dengue in the city and poor civic conditions aggravating spread of the infection, Dr Pankaj Singhai, senior consultant of internal medicine at Manipal Hospitals, said: “Dengue is a monsoon disease; the rain and sudden change in temperature are usually responsible for it. However, waterlogging on streets (10-15cm) after every downpour and and accumulation of stagnant water are leading to the increasing incidence of dengue in the city.”
 
 Apart from eliminating breeding sites, civic agencies should take stricter steps to spread awareness about the disease, say doctors. “Creating awareness among people about the need for prevention, and educating them about the symptoms and the need to visit the hospital at the right time can check the outbreak,” said Dr Praveen Kumar G B, senior consultant, general medicine, St Martha’s Hospital.
 
 
 
 
 Several other infections with symptoms similar to those of Dengue are on the rise. Leptospirosis, rickettsia, chikungunya and malaria are affecting the city and have to be checked : Dr Mahesh Kumar, consultant physician, Narayana Health City
