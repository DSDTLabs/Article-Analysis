MADURAI: With most of the buses going off the road, the city residents, passengers as well as tourists had to rely on private transport services like share auto rickshaws and mini buses. However, they came with a cost. Mini buses and share auto rickshaws made a killing as they charged 30 to 40% higher than the actual fare. The passengers who had no other choice, had to shell out the extra money to reach their destination.

 S Aravindan, a resident of   said, “The actual fare between Periyar Bus Terminal and   is Rs 17, but the private buses charged Rs 25. We do not have any other option but to cough it up, otherwise we have to wait endlessly,” he said.
 
 K Sangeetha, a college student from  , said that she had to wait for a long time at Periyar Bus Terminal to catch a bus to Alangannlur.
 
 The private buses began overcharging at almost all the routes they operated in the city as well as the rural pockets. Similarly, share auto rickshaw service, which is a popular mode of transport in the city, too fleeced the customers. The drivers had doubled up the fare and made the most out of the situation. While, few people had an idea about the transport issue on Friday, most of them were clueless when the buses suddenly stopped their services.
 
 Hence, the passengers had no other option but to rely only on share auto rickshaws. S Karthirvel, an auto rickshaw driver from  , said that he normally earns Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 a day but, on Thursday his earnings tripled. He extended his timings and worked till 1.30 am as he found a large number of customers.
