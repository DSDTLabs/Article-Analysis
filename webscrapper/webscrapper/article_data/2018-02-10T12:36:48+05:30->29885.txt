KOLLAM: Deputy director of education (Kollam) K S Sreekala, in anotice, has directed the   diocese corporate manager to immediately remove the principal of   school, S  , from the post since he is over aged and does not seem to be in a physically fit condition to handle school affairs. The school is under the management of the Kollam diocese.

 
 The notice reflects the strong stand taken by the DDE in the wake of reports that the school authorities led by the principal had organized a celebration at the school to welcome back two teachers who were arrested on charges of abetting the suicide of a Class X student. The girl had jumped from the school building over alleged harassment by the teachers.
 
 The notice says that if such incidents are repeated, the DDE will be compelled to recommend to the government and   the withdrawal of the schoolâ€™s  . The notice that cites ICSE rules regarding the age of principals also says the principal appeared to be apathetic to queries from the DDE office about the alleged celebrations.
