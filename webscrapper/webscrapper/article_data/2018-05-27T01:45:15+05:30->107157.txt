GHAZIABAD: The  , faced with a  , might take up work on the extension of two metro projects — Vaishali to   and Noida Sector 62 to Sahibabad — one at a time.

 In a recent meeting with the chief secretary in Lucknow over the funding pattern to be adopted for the Phase 3 Metro line, the state government had apparently stressed the need to explore local resources to raise   for the extension lines.
 
 
  
 “At the meeting, it was decided that we will have to adopt the same funding pattern that we are doing for the Dilshad Garden-News Bus stand metro line for the two proposed metro extensions. But even that seems to be a bit difficult at the monent,” said Ritu  , GDA vice-chairperson. “In the near future, we will have many more meetings with the state government to decide on the funding pattern, but as of now, it looks like the old funding pattern will be adopted,” she added.
 
 But given the estimated cost of the two extension projects, which has been pegged at Rs 4,048 crore, and against the backdrop of the state government stressing on the need to explore local resources to raise funds, Maheshwari suggested that the two extension projects would be taken up in a phased manner, starting with the Vaishali to Mohan Nagar line.
 
 “As a last resort, we will have to take up work on the two extension projects one at a time as this will help us tide over the financial crunch that the projects face. But, we would like to reiterate that this would be our last resort,” Maheshwari said.
 
 The estimated cost of the 5.06-km Vaishali to Mohan Nagar line is Rs 2,118 crore. “Under the existing funding pattern, this looks achievable,” said Maheshwari. 
 
 Under the old funding pattern for the   Bus stand metro line, the UP government would contribute 63% of the total cost of the project — Rs 2,210 crore — while the Centre will give 20% and DMRC the remaining. Officials have been holding a series of meetings of late to discuss the funding model.
