HYDERABAD: A fortnight after a severed head of a three-month-old baby was found on a terrace, triggering shockwaves in the city, the murder trail led to the house of a cabbie in Uppal locality. Backed by DNA evidence, police cracked the case on Thursday, exposing the dark underbelly of superstition, black magic and human sacrifice to appease spirits on the night of super-blue blood moon. 

 
  
  
 
 Cabbie Rajashekar Goud, 40, enacted the macabre dance of death, chopped the baby's head on the banks of Musi, tossed the torso into the river, waited for the blood to coagulate before placing the head at the southwest corner of their terrace in moonlight. Police said, Rajashekar and his wife Srilatha Goud, 35, watched voodoo videos on   to perform kshudra puja (human sacrifice). The evil thought was sown in their minds two years ago by a tribal tantrik to heal the failing health of Srilatha. DNA tests on blood stains on a tile in the house busted the murder plot and exposed the role of the couple.
