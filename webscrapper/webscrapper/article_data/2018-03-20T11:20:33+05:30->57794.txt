 The woman, identified as  , was found dead by her brother-in-law Balaji at around 5pm on Monday evening. As there was no response when he knocked on the door, he peeped through the window only to see her hanging from a ceiling fan with a sari, said a police officer. 
 
 Balaji broke open the door with the help of neighbours and found her two children, four-year-old Roshini and two-year-old Amalesh, also hanging from a fan. Vengal police inspector Kumar and his team recovered the three bodies and sent them to the government hospital in Tiruvallur for autopsy. 
 
 Police have registered a case under CrPC Section 174 (unnatural death). Lavanya, a homemaker, had married Babu, a van driver, five years ago. 
 
 Lavanya had not left behind any suicide note, said an investigating officer. Police are probing whether the woman had taken the extreme step due to a feud with her husband. 
 
 Police forwarded the case to the revenue divisional officer (RDO) for inquiry as she died before the completion of seven years of marriage.
