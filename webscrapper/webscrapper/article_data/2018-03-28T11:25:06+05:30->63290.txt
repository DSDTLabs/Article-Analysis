NAGPUR: A peculiar situation has arisen in recovery of arrears of  , where an illegal power distribution racket was unearthed by   in 2015. The society is headed by prominent builder Pramod Manmode.

 The society used to pilfer power by tapping into   (HT) wires and distribute it to residents of  , built by it. When SNDL unearthed the power theft, it issued recovery notice against secretary of the society and also registered a first information report (FIR) against him.
 
 The society had installed local electric meters in all the houses and used to charge at a flat rate of Rs 8 per unit for power. It had also collected Rs81,000 from each flat owner for providing electrical infrastructure.
 
 It is three years since unearthing of the racket, but the secretary is yet to pay the arrears to the tune of Rs10.12 lakh. Residents of Nirmal Nagri alleged that SNDL officials came to the township some days ago and asked the residents to pay up. SNDL spokesperson, however, denied this allegation and said that the franchisee only had powers to recover the arrears from the secretary and it was the secretary who is asking the residents to contribute. The spokesperson said that the residents were also guilty to some extent as they were part of an illegal network.
 
 Prafulla Karpe, president of Nirmal Nagri Condominium, claimed that SNDL officials had apologized to the residents for trying to collect dues. “We have not pilfered power and have paid regular bills to the society. We were under the impression that the society was a legal distribution franchisee in the township. We were issued bills as per our consumption. SNDL should recover the dues from Manmode and not us,” he added.
 
 The residents have lodged a complaint with Nandanvan police and have written to chief minister   and energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule seeking their intervention.
