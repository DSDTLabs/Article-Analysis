Ferozepur/Ludhiana: Contributing her bit to strengthen democracy in Punjab, 108-year-old Basanti Devi cast her vote with the help of her grandson in Ferozepur on Saturday. Unable to move on her own, Basanti was carried to the polling booth by her grandson Suraj Prakash. She said she was casting her vote for the 37th time, cast both in assembly and parliamentary elections.

 Suraj claimed his granny had been insisting on exercising her franchise since morning but the family was hesitant as the weather was cold and there was cold breeze blowing. “As the weather turned better in the afternoon, I brought my grandmother to the polling booth with the help of my wife,” he added. Basanti cast her vote at polling booth set up in government girls’ senior secondary school, Ferozepur. 
 
 “She is quite happy after casting her vote. Though she has hearing problem and other old-age related complications, she is well versed with the entire polling process,” he added.
 
 Another such voter was 106-year-old Mala Devi, too exercised her franchise in Ludhiana. A resident of ward number 12 at Guru Arjan Dev Nagar, she cast her vote at booth number 132. She was provided a pick-and-drop facility by the Ludhiana administration, Ludhiana deputy commissioner Ravi Bhagat said. 
 
 Poll volunteers went to her residence and brought her, along with some family members, to the polling station and dropped her home after she cast her vote, he said. She was taken to the booth in a wheelchair and presented a rose later.
 
 Bhagat, who is the district election officer (DEO), said the administration through volunteers was approaching such voters at their residence to bring them to the polling booth. “We are in process of identifying more with an aim to helping all such persons cast their votes by evening,” he added.
