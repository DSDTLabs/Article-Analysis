HYDERABAD: His sensational claim that   alias  , who was then an accused in the   blast case, had a change of heart, made headlines some years ago. However, after acquittal of the five accused in the blast case, Abdul  , who was a jailmate of   and a witness in the case, refused to to give his reaction on the verdict as he did not wish to land in any ‘further trouble’.

 When TOI contacted Kaleem for his reaction, he said: “After I gave the statement, I suffered a lot. For the last couple of years, things are going smoothly. I am happy with my life. On this issue, I chose not to come before media’’. When Aseemanand was arrested in the blast case in 2010 and lodged at the   jail, Kaleem was also in the same prison in connection with a case.
 
 In 2011, Kaleem told media that he meet Aseemanand and told the latter about the torture several Muslim youth, including himself, had to face and how the blast changed their lives.
 
 After the conversation, according to Kaleem’s then statement, Aseemanand had a change of heart and gave a confessional statement before a judge in New Delhi about the Mecca Masjid blast conspiracy and other cases. However a year later, Aseemanand retracted his confession, claiming he gave it under duress.
 
 Immediately after the blast in May 2007, Kaleem and several youngsters were picked up, but they all got clean chit later. “When I spoke to him, Aseemanand did tell me. The same thing I told court as a witness. Please leave me, I want to stay away from the media and do not want further trouble,” he pleaded.
