MUMBAI/CHANDIGARH: Soon after the three-day-old B S Yeddyurappa government in Karnataka collapsed on Saturday ahead of a crucial trust vote, NCP president Sharad   and Punjab chief minister   demanded the resignation of state governor Vajubhai Vala. 

 Pawar said Vala's decision to invite Yeddyurappa to form the government and give him 15 days to prove his majority on the floor of the House had damaged democracy. "The governor should keep the prestige of his post intact. He has dealt a blow to democracy and should therefore resign," he said.
 
 "I congratulate Congress and JD(S) MLAs for not falling prey to allurements. BJP should not have made haste to make Yeddyurappa chief minister when it did not have a (clear) majority," Pawar told reporters in Mumbai. BJP's decision to make BSY the CM was a "blow to democracy", he said.
 
 Hailing the collapse of the BSY government, Punjab chief minister said it was a vindication of the Congress's moral stand and a "total loss of face" for BJP. Singh alleged BJP had "stooped to new lows" in its desperation to grab power "hook or by crook".
 
  Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said Yeddyurappa's resignation was the start of the end of "dictatorship and high-handedness", apparently referring to BJP's efforts to manage enough support from the newly-elected MLAs ahead of the trust vote. "What happened in Karnataka was against democracy. It's the end of a perverted mindset which believed that elections can be won and governments can be formed by any means," Raut said. pti
