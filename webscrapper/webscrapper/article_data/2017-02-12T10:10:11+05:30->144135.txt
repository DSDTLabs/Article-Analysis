NAGPUR: Shripad Risaldar, a senior   and former aide of union transport minister  , has decided to approach the court over his expulsion from BJP. According to Risaldar, he had resigned from the party before filing his nomination as a rebel candidate for Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and hence   could not legally expel him. Risaldar addressed a press conference on Saturday to clarify his position.

 Risaldar, who is the director of Vidarbha Premier Housing Society, is contesting against   of BJP. He had demanded ticket from Ward 19 but when Tiwari got it, he decided to contest on Vidarbha Maza ticket. Risaldar has formed a panel of disgruntled BJP activists in ward 19. Efforts by city BJP president Sudhakar Kohale and BJP’s NMC election in-charge Anil Sole failed to persuade him to withdraw.
 
 BJP is facing rebellion on unprecedented scale this time. It has expelled 65 rebels while 52 office-bearers have resigned. The expelled rebels include other RSS activists too — the prominent ones being Vishakha Joshi and Pankaj Patel. Another RSS worker Atul Senad too is contesting as an independent but as he is not a primary member of BJP, the party could not take any disciplinary action against him. RSS ideologue   had recently said that it was not necessary that RSS should support BJP in every election.
