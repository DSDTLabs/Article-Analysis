MUMBAI: Plans of L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, to resume its   are likely to be thwarted by the state government once again as its appeal for reissuing of the licence comes up for discussion next week. 

 Over six months ago, police had busted a kidney racket at the hospital and cancelled the licences of the hospital and transplant surgeons. A   (DHS) officer said the hospital has since sent at least two applications for permission.
 
 "The hospital claims it was not directly involved in the racket but we are not of that opinion. As per our department's findings, its top authorities were negligent," said Dr  ,  . But since the hospital has been persistent, he said the application will be placed before the advisory committee that gives recommendations to the appropriate authority on important matters of organ transplant.
 
 Experts are likely to finalise new standard operating protocols at the meeting.
