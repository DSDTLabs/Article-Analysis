Actress   says she prefers to abstain from social media. 

  
  
 The 27-year-old star said she finds power in knowing that she does not need anyone to truly understand her,."I abstain from it and I don't feel the need to explain to the world who I am to anyone. If there's some sort of perception of me, then so be it. I am still figuring it out and I have found power in knowing that I don't need anybody to truly understand me. That is the last privacy I have really,"   Johnson said. 
 
 The 'Fifty Shades Darker' actress said she does not regret taking on the role of   in the erotic film but admits it can be 'frightening' to get so much fame so quickly. 
 
 "Regrets, well, these films are juggernauts. Sometimes they can be frightening but I don't necessarily regret it, though at the same time, I don't always feel completely one hundred per cent positive. I get waves of fear and I get waves of insecurity, and I wonder what people are going to take from this.
