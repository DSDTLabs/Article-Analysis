LUDHIANA: Miffed with the increasing number of incidents at fuel stations across the city where individuals and several groups have alleged chip and meter tampering scams, Petroleum Dealers Association Ludhiana (PDAL) on Monday had organised a meeting on the issue.

 Dr Manjeet Singh, general secretary of PDAL, said, “We are governed by stringent law whereby several laid down procedures are available for legal redressal mechanism with respect to any grievance that a consumer may have against a   pump. However, despite the above mechanisms available, some people instead of following the law have started threatening the staff. What is even more shocking is that even the requests of the law enforcement agencies to follow law are being ignored and various groups, hooligans are taking the law into their own hands by resorting to dharnas, threats and even violence.”
 
 According to president of association  , “We are feeling helpless over the rise in the number of such incidents. The allegations in almost every case turn out to be false. We are bound by law and laid down procedures and expect the same from each citizen. We stand committed to serving our customers to the best of our ability and shall always respond and address any grievance that our customers may have.”
 
 He also said that if anyone has any complaint in regards to any petrol pump he/she can lodge a formal complaint in the complaint book provided by the oil company at the fuel station. One can even call the helpline number of the oil company displayed at every petrol pump. Others present on this occasion included chairman of PDAL  , vice presidents  ,   and Rohit Mehra and treasurer Jagdev Singh Gill.
