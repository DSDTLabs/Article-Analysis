NEW DELHI: An   operating out of south Delhi’s Neb Serai has been busted with the arrest of four men. 

 The police said the accused — Subhash (26), Sachin (27), Gurpreet (25) and Deepak (26) — are friends and previously worked as property dealers. After suffering huge losses in their businesses, the accused — who also used to gamble together — rented a house in the area and started running the   racket. 
 
 Several police teams were formed recently in south Delhi to keep a tab on illegal activities. One such team got a tip-off about the racket during a raid at a nearby colony. “On Tuesday, a team led by the SHO  , Kuldeep Yadav, raided the house,” said  , deputy commissioner of police (south). Betting was then being carried out on the first semifinal match in IPL. 
 
 Fifteen mobile phones, a laptop and an LED television have been seized. From the laptop data, it has been found that 50-60 people had betted on IPL matches in the past two weeks, involving transactions of over Rs 15 lakh. A case under Gambling Act has been registered.
