AHMEDABAD: Dalit youth in Ahmedabad and   districts have begun a social media campaign, in solidarity with Piyush   of Limbodara village, who was allegedly beaten up by members of an upper caste for sporting a mustache.

 As part of the campaign, dalit youths are posting selfies with mustaches twirled, asserting that it is their constitutional right to do so, with hashtags such as ‘#JativaadNaVirodhMa (Opposing casteism), #PiyushbhaiNaSamarthanMa (In support of  ) and #SamidhanNaSamarthan Ma (In support of the Constitution).
 
 Since the campaign was launched, a second similar incident has occurred. Another dalit youth,  , was also beaten up in the same village, for sporting a mustache.
 
 Jayesh Parmar, a cashier at a city hotel posted on his Facebook page, “Some hoodlums and perpetrators of casteist ideology couldn’t digest the fact that a dalit boy can also sport a mustache, so they beat him up and that too near the state capital Gandhinagar.”
 
 Another youth, Manish Manjulaben Siddharth, posted, “Casteism does not allow me to sport a mustache but this country’s constitution gives me absolute freedom to sport one. I am in support of a casteless India.”
 
 Subodh Parmar, another youth from Ahmedabad wrote, “This campaign shows that we are fearless in choosing how to live and what to wear,” Parmar said.
 
 Gaurang Jani, city-based sociologist, says, “A social media campaign can help sensitize other communities about the atrocities heaped on dalits. Discrimination against dalits — like not being allowed to wear a mustache, ride a bicycle or a horse during weddings — used to be hushed up. Such protests on social media are thus important.”
 
 Kaushik Parmar, a dalit rights activist, says dalit youth have taken up this peaceful protest energetically. “We believe it is our fundamental right to decide how we look and what we wear as the Constitution gives us protection and individual rights,” he said.
