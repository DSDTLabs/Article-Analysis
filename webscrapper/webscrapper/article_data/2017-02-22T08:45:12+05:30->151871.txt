BENGALURU:  , the man who is suspected to have   a banker with a machete in an ATM kiosk at Corporation Circle on November 19, 2013, will be brought to the city from   on February 28, senior police officers told TOI. 

 Andhra Pradesh police had on February 4 announced the arrest of Reddy after they found him moving suspiciously near a gold shop in   a few days earlier.
 
 A check of Madhukar Reddy's antecedents had revealed that he was a fugitive murder convict, accused in a murder and two attempt-to-murder cases in Andhra Pradesh. "We had applied for his custody with a local court after Andhra Pradesh police arrested him. Since Andhra police are still questioning him, the court has agreed to hand Reddy to our custody for 15 days from February 28," senior police officers said. 
 
 According to sources in Bengaluru police, Reddy would also be questioned whether he had attacked or robbed any other lone woman or man in Bengaluru and other parts of the state.
 
 They said Reddy's criminal records showed he would often target women and men when t hey were alone. 
 
  "We have directed divisional police officials of the rank of inspector and above to prepare a detailed report on cases where lone women or men were attacked or either robbed. In such unsolved cases, we will ascertain from the victims if Madhukar Reddy was the one who had attacked and robbed them," police said. 
 
 Asked whether they would request the Andhra Pradesh court to extend the custody of Madhukar Reddy, a senior police officer said it depends on the outcome of the interrogation.
 
 "First, Jyothi Uday, the woman who was attacked in the ATM kiosk, has to identify him. Then, if we find that Reddy has committed more offences in the city, we will seek extension of his custody," he said.
