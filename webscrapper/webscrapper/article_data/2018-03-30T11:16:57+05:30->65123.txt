KOLHAPUR: In the backdrop of the recent rallies that were organised in the state in connection with the Koregaon Bhima clashes, superintendent of police (SP)   warned that legal action will be taken against those who are found spreading objectionable messages on social media platforms that may likely upset law and order. 

 Mohite said, “Our cyber cell has observed some anti-social elements, operating across the state, are spreading messages that may instigate different groups and disrupt the peace in the society. These people are taking the help of social networking sites like Facebook and Whatsapp to spread their message. We have taken a note and initiated action against these anti-social elements under the IT Act.”
 
 “We appeal people not to fall prey to these type of messages and forward them as they may create unnecessary tension among the communities and lead to violence. We are taking cautious steps to make arrangements for the celebrations of   on April 14 and   on April 17,” said the SP. 
 
 He further added, “We expect peace and harmony to prevail in the district during this period without any untoward incident. We are keeping a tab on social networking sites and will be taking action against those who upload any objectionable post during this period.” 
 
 The superintendent of police said, “We appeal people not to forward posts that may bring them under police scanner. We are taking the necessary precautions to avoid such messages from going viral. We expect support from citizens to maintain peace in the district.” .
