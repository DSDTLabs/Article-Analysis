RAJASANSI (AMRITSAR): Two days after joining the Congress, former   leader   arrived in Amritsar on Tuesday. The former cricketer, who had left city as BJP leader and returned as   nominee, was welcomed at the airport with slogans like “Aa giya Sidhu, chha giya Sidhu”. 

 In the welcome party, Raj Kumar Verka, Gurjit Singh Aujla, Jugal Kishore and Sukhjinder Raj Singh Lalli Majithia were the prominent faces among Sidhu’s new colleagues of the Congress. They accused BJP of sending him into ‘exile’.
 
 Riding an open vehicle, Sidhu went to the Golden Temple, Jallianwala Bagh and Durgiana temple besides halting at various places to receive greetings from his supporters.
 
 He will file his nomination papers from Amritsar East assembly constituency, represented by his wife Dr   who had BJP after he did but joined the Congress before him.
 
 To challenge Sidhu from the constituency, BJP has fielded one of his former confidants Rajesh Honey, who is the president of Amritsar (Urban) unit of the party.   his nominated businessmen Sarabjot Singh as its candidate. In addition, Congress dissident   has filed his papers from the constituency as an Independent.
 
 Honey said, “Today’s politics seeks 24x7 presence of a leader in the constituency. Sidhu will never stay here continuously for even 20 days.” He said though he had good relations with Sidhu in the past, now he was just a political opponent from a party which they had jointly been censuring.
 
 Former district BJP spokesperson Somdev Sharma, also a former Sidhu confidant, said, “We welcome Sidhu to contest election but it is not going to be a cakewalk for him. BJP is ready to give him a tough fight in the constituency, besides he has a disadvantage of not having his loyal supporters by his side now.”
