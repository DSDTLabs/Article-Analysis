They say, ‘fat is in our genes’. It has been known for a long time now that   do impact the way our bodies assimilate fat and the way we look. Globally the rate at which obesity is growing is really scary. Obesity is a complex phenomenon which is difficult to understand as it is impacted by both heredity and the environment.

 In general obesity is tough to manage but it becomes really complicated in children. It is very difficult to identify the role of each gene or genetic component that contributes to this phenomenon. A recent study published in the journal Economics and Human Biology looks at a very specific component i.e. BMI (Body Mass Index) and its impact on childhood obesity. The results of this study very clearly point out two things:
 
 Each parent passes on 0.2 intergenerational elasticity of BMI that means 20% inheritance from each parent
 No matter which stage of development a country or community is; the BMI (Body Mass Index) elasticity remains almost the same
 This study looks at data from the most   country USA and the least obese countries like China and Indonesia. It clearly indicates that the thinner kids get 10% of their BMI elasticity from each parent whereas the heavier kids inherit nearly 30% of this from either of the parents. This data is a huge insight into the future of the generations and how BMI (Body Mass Index) is an integral part of weight management. Therefore, it is needless to say that baby fat is no longer a sign of good health and wellbeing.
