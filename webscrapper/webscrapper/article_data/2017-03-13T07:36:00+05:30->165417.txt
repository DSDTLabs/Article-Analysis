I think the entire party worked on development agenda. I don’t think my delayed entry was a problem. There has to be a time for ascendancy. We all saw what happened to AAP. They thought they had peaked, but peaked at the wrong time and on wrong reasons.
 
 
 
 I held 32 rallies in 32 constituencies and we won 30 of them. So, you can see my strike rate (laughs).
 
 
 
 See, that is for Captain saab and Rahulji to decide. But what I can say is that if I get a role, I will leave everything.
 
 
 
 First of all, I need to clear this confusion. The shows are not shot for seven days. I go to Mumbai only once a week, for the rest of the days I am in the national capital.
 
 
 
 To bring Punjab back on the path of glory. I want to see that Punjab’s green revolution is back and it can be called granary of India without any signs of farmer distress. I recently finished a book on Punjab’s valour on how men from here have won 269 Param Vishisht Seva Medals, the highest for any state in the country. I want to see a drug-free Punjab without debt burden and whose men can work in defence or find jobs.
