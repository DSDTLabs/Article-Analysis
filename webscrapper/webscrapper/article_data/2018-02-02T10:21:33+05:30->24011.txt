TRICHY: Representatives from micro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSME) welcomed the   announcement to develop two new defence industrial production corridors and the promise to implement online loan sanctioning facility in the sector.

 S  , president of BHEL Small and Medium Industries Association ( ) said, “The proposed corridors, if they cover potential defence armament producing industries in Trichy, Salem and Bengaluru, would be a boon for MSMEs looking to make a foray in defence manufacturing.”
 
 Industrialists in the city also welcomed the facility to implement online loan   which has been touted to ease the process of availing financial support if needed.
