RAJKOT:  , son of Karnataka governor and former finance minister of Gujarat,  , has lodged another cheating complaint against three persons including Samir Shah, promoter of Rajmoti Oil Industries and his brother Shyam.

 Bhavdeep has accused them of framing him in a cheque bounce case in Rajkot. He has also named Parbat Rajoria, owner of Rajlakshmi firm in Amreli, in his complaint. He was a partner in Rajmoti Oil whose owner Samir Shah was also the former president of   (RCCI). Later, Bhavdeep, who lives in Jankalyan Society on Tagore Road, withdrew from the partnership. However, the mill account in the SBI had an authority of Bhavdeep in whose signature cheques were issued.
 
 “Samir and Shyam allegedly signed a bogus cheque worth Rs 43 crore by forging Bhavdeep’s signatures and issuing it to Rajoria on March 19, 2016. The cheque bounced as the bank account had been closed. Once the cheque was returned by the bank, Rajoria filed a case against Bhavdeep in a court in Amreli in 2016,” said R S Thakar, B-Division police station inspector. The accused kept Bhavdeep in the dark about the development and he came to know about it only when the court case was filed against him. He lodged a complaint of fraud and cheating against the three. 
 
 Earlier, in 2016 too, Bhavdeep had a lodged a similar complaint against Shah brothers, manager Samir Gandhi, Rajendra Kakkad and two Jamnagar-based businessmen Dharmesh Madlani and Mitesh Sayani for criminal breach of trust), forgery and and criminal conspiracy. 
 
 Samir Shah is already an accused in the case of murdering Dinesh Daxini, an Ahmedabad-based staffer of his company.
