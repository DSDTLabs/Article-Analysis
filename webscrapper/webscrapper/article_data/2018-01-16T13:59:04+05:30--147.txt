 came to an end just a couple of days back and its second runner-up,   made a series of tweets looking by at his journey in the show. In the grips of nostalgia, the 'Mastermind' of the show lend voice to his emotions.

 He took to Twitter to post a picture of Bigg Boss host-actor   with the message that read as - And this journey of BigBoss comes to an End . A lot of people to thank so won't write everyone's names but will say that this show wouldn't be what it became if even one of you wasn't part of it, from the gharwale to the baharwale...(sic).”
 
 Take a look the post here:
 
  
  
 In another tweet, in which he is seen with contestant Arshi Khan, he wrote - #Cast&Crew #bigboss11 , May each and everyone of you have the most amazing journey ahead, wish u all crazy year ahead and super success. Thankyou @BeingSalmanKhan for the most amazing Food and guidance every weekend that kept all of us all going. (sic).”
 
  
  
 It would do good to mention that this is not the first time that Salman, who is known for his generous nature, has provided food for the Bigg Boss housemates. Contestants of the previous seasons, like Sana Khan and others have been talked about it in the past.
 
 One can safely conclude the Salman Khan is as popular on the big screen as he is on the small one
