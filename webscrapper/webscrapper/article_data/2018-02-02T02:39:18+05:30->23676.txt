MUMBAI: One more doctor from civic-run   was arrested on Thursday in connection with the death of Lalbaug resident   (32) who got stuck in an MRI machine on January 27. 

 Dr Siddhant Shah, who works in the  , was questioned throughout Thursday before being arrested, said Agripada police. Shah’s name cropped up after Rajesh’s family alleged that he too was present during the incident. “We now want that the case to be fast-tracked,” said Rajesh’s brother, Yogesh.
 
 Police had earlier arrested three hospital staffers—Dr Saurabh Lanjrekar, ward boy Vithal Chavan and attendant Sunita Surve—for negligence causing Rajesh’s death. 
 
 The family, meanwhile, continues to wait for Rajesh’s  , which is stuck in the machine. The Philips Healthcare engineering team needed NOCs from the hospital dean and the local police station. “Both letters were given on Thursday. We expect the team to arrive on Friday to remove the   and assess whether the machine needs repairs before it becomes operational again,” said a doctor.
