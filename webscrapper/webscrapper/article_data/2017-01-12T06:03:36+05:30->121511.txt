KOLKATA: A day before   MP   is produced before the  ,   have repotedly come across “anomalies” in the expense details of his foreign trips. The agencies are scrutinizing each tour, including flight booking, hotel accommodation and local transport, to find if the leader was provided with more expensive services than had paid to the travel agency. Bandyopadhyay had earlier claimed that he had paid Rs 5 lakh to a travel agency for his Europe trip. CBI, however, beleives that the actual amount paid for this trip was much more (than Rs 5 lakh) and that had been paid by  .

 Two more   teams left Kolkata for Bhubaneswar on Wednesday to look into the discrepancies.
 
  Bandyopadhyay allegedly travelled executive class though economy class tickets had been purchased. He also stayed in higher star category accommodation than what he was supposed to. An official of the travel agency reportedly told the investigating officer that Rose Valley had paid the extra money.
 
 Rose Valley on Wednesday claimed it had returned Rs 11,000 crore to investors before ED began attaching the company’s properties. “ED liquidated Rs 800 crore from 3,000 accounts of Rose Valley. It became impossible for the company to return money to investors after that,” said Rose Valley owner Gautam Kundu’s lawyer Biplab Goswami. 
 
 Goswami also questioned the validity of the statements of agents, regional managers of various agencies and a PR firm that formed the basis of the case against Kundu.
