KOLKATA: The south suburban division police have arrested two security guards of a   residential school for allegedly molesting several girls studying in classes VI-VIII.

 
 At least five students confided to counsellors of an   that they had been groped by the suspects — one of whom had been an employee at the school for 25 years. Around 100 girls now study at the school.
 
 The girls alleged that their torment started around 18 months ago, when   (61) and   (58) touched them inappropriately. Cops from the Kasba police stations have slapped stringent charges under POCSO Act against the duo.
 
 “We are prima facie convinced about the allegations and have registered a case, before arresting the duo between Thursday night and Friday evening,” a police officer said.
 
 Police said they will record statements of the five minors before a magistrate. Though   confirmed the incident, officers refused to be quoted citing the “sensitiveness” of the matter.
 
 Police said, so far, they have not found any lapse on part of the school administration. The principal informed us as so nas she spoke to the NGO members who take care of the girls.
 
 Educationists feel that schools need to do more than what they are doing now. “One does not pronounce someone guilty by informing the cops. It was a right decision by the principal.One can also try involving teachers to find out the sequence of events,” a principal of a Jadavpur school said.
