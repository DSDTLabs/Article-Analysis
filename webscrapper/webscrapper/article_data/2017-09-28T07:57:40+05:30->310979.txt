CHENNAI: A spike in cases of   in Chennai and neighbouring districts in the past fortnight has moved the   to intensify its fight against the disease.

 The department is taking steps to enforce  , penalise offenders more strictly and hold more public meetings to spread awareness.
 
 Chennai recorded at least three deaths in the past week, taking the toll in the state to 20 since January. More than 8,000 people in the state, including 130 in the city, have tested positive for dengue in nine months.
 
 The health department created awareness programmes for paramedics and school headmasters on Wednesday, a day after addressing doctors.
 
  C Vijaya Baskar and department officials visited various neighbourhoods in the city to conduct checks and promote awareness.
 
 “We came across mosquito breeding sites inside and outside houses,” director of public health   said. “Water stored in open containers had larvae floating in them. Residents should use closed containers to store water. Rainwater in garbage like cups and polythene bags is an even bigger threat.”
 
 Metrowater and the corporation have been working with the department in vulnerable areas, Kolandaisamy said.
 
 Audits show that most deaths took place because patients arrived late at tertiary care centres.
 
 “They either don’t meet doctors on time or doctors don’t treat them according to protocol,” health secretary J Radhakrishnan said.
 
 Officials have received instructions to ensure that government buildings follow proper sanitation practices.
