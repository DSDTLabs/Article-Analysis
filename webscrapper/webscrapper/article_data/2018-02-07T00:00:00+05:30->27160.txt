When   says that the music in his upcoming musical is his best work in   so far, you know that there is something to look forward to. Raghu turns producer (he prefers calling it ‘partner’) for   — a musical about the the orchestra culture in   and the dream of a boy who wants to sing in an orchestra. Director   first approached Raghu to act in his film, but Raghu chose to do the music instead. And compose he did — all 11 original tracks.

 “Sunil had a brilliant story. He had shot a 20-minute edit of the entire story when he approached me. As a musician, I was really moved after watching it and instantly wanted to be a part of the film. Eventually, the music we made is enough for three films (laughs). We have 11 original songs and it is the best music that I have done in Kannada so far. I am really excited,” says Raghu, who adds that the highlight of the songs is the lyrics by actor  .
 
 “Dhananjaya has written incredible lyrics. Usually, lyricists write one or two songs in a film, but on his first assignment, Dhananjaya has written lyrics for nine songs. He took his time, but he has nailed it,” says Raghu. But this doesn’t surprise Sunil, who knows Dhananjaya as a writer. “We are from the same theatre group and all of us knew him more as a writer than an actor. He is a very good writer,” says the director.
