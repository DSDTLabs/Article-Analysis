INDORE: Congress workers on Tuesday staged a demonstration at Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya’s   campus accusing the vice chancellor of forcing affiliated colleges to cough up money to meet expenses to the tune of Rs 25 lakh to fund a performance of BJP   MP   in upcoming youth festival.

 The Congress workers alleged that the DAVV V-C Dr   Dhakad was appeasing his political bosses by inviting a BJP politician to perform at the South Asian Universities Festival (SAUFEST) to be held in February.
 
 “They will pay Rs 25 lakh for Hema Malini to perform. We will not allow this huge amount of money to be spent on a dance,” the leaders claimed, adding while the condition of buildings and hostels in the DAVV institutes was deteriorating, the amount should be spent on developing the facilities. 
 
 The protesters claimed that the V-C was forcing affiliated colleges to cough up money to meet the cost of bringing Hema Malini and her troupe to Indore.
 
 “The SAUFEST is not an academic event. We decided to call a celebrity to the event that will be attended by representatives of 10 SAARC nations. What is wrong in this,” asked Dr Dhakad.
 
 “Hema Malini charges Rs 40 lakh for such a performance. She is only asking Rs 20 lakh from us. The rest Rs 5 lakh will be spent on getting her troupe and equipment to the venue,” the V-C told TOI.
 
 He said the university does not have corporate sponsors. “We are eyeing for sponsorship from banks and colleges. We are also approaching some companies and builders to sponsor the performance,” he said.
 
 On the protest by Congress workers, he said the protesters are not students. “Why should the meddle in university affairs,” he added.
