NEW DELHI: South corporation’s 100-bed   in Kalkaji will soon be converted into an 8-storey satellite centre of  .

 The approval to the proposal was given during the standing committee meeting of the   (SDMC) on Tuesday.
 
 Chairman of the committee Shailendra Singh Monty said, “Everyone will benefit from this agreement. The corporation will gain financially and people will get specialised care from renowned hospital in their locality.”
 
 “We were facing a problem in running it due to lack of specialty doctors. Space was also underutilised and fund crunch was imminent,” he added.
 
 The centre, which was originally started as a colony hospital in 1950s, is being reconstructed into an 8-story building with a built up area of almost 24,000 sq meters. 
 
 A SDMC official said, “Due to fund crunch and Delhi government not releasing any money, the construction — beyond the basic RCC structure — could not be completed. As of now only OPD services are operational from ground and first floor. Since the building is located strategically, it can act as a satellite of a larger hospital.”
 
 Civic officials said that they failed to get permission to run the hospital in PPP mode, as the Delhi government did not give its approval for the same.
