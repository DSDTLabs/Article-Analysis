HYDERABAD: India’s first MBA degree holder woman sarpanch, Chhavi  , on Tuesday said panchayats in India must be granted more autonomy in terms of spending and fund raising to ensure smooth functioning.

 Rajawat, who quit an   job to return to her native village Soda, Rajasthan, to pursue development work, was in Hyderabad to participate in a Ficci’s   event.
 
 “I believe panchayats must be given funds that can be used at their own discretion. In our area, we are dependent on district authorities...in 2009, the village saw one of its worst droughts...the bureaucracy was aware of it and while the village wanted a water-related project first, it was sanctioned an anganwadi. Even if we generate funds…we need approvals to utilise these funds…,” she said.
 
 She also said elected panchayat representatives can be empowered by ensuring they are adequately trained on aspects like budgets, schemes, how to go about approvals, among others.
