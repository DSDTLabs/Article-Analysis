NEW DELHI: Two men who had misbehaved with a woman doctor at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital were allegedly thrashed by a junior resident doctor and four   late on Thursday.

 A woman   was admitted to the hospital on Thursday. Her husband, Sunil, and his brother got into an argument and shouted at a woman doctor over delay in her treatment. Subsequently, cops deployed there took them to a police booth at the hospital. A police team from Hari Nagar police station also reached there.
 
 Suddenly, a junior resident doctor, Arnav (32), who was not on duty, entered the police booth along with four bouncers and started thrashing the duo.
 
 When the SHO reached the hospital, he found the entrance closed and several patients waiting outside. “MLCs were conducted and based on the complaints a case was registered. The junior doctors are on strike, but critical cases are being handled,” said DCP (west) Vijay Kumar.
 
 Dr Arnab Pramanik, vice-president of   resident doctors’ association, said the strike will continue till security is strengthened at the hospital. “Instead of acting against the patient’s attendants who abused our colleague, the cops are trying to show that we got into a fight. It is a baseless charge,” he added.
