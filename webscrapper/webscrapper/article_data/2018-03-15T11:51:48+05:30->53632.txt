VELLORE: The family of 17 year-old S Naveen, who sustained serious injuries in a helium gas balloon cylinder blast during the school   on January 31, pleaded with the district administration to extend   for his medical expenses.

 The incident claimed the life of V Jeethesh, while it left Naveen with life-threatening injuries. The two were Class XII students of Shanthiniketan Matriculation School in Sathuvachari. Naveen was hospitalised for 23 days at the Christian Medical College Hospital, where he underwent surgery. Though he is on the mend, Naveen lost vision in his left eye. He is unable to stand or sit without support. 
 
 Unable to bear the medical expenses, Naveen’s parents N Sivalingam and Selvi approached the district administration and petitioned   S A Raman during the Monday public grievance meeting, pleading for financial assistance to take care of their only son’s medical expenses.
 
 The school management bore the medical bills and treatment cost, said Sivalingam. He, however, said that the   was discharged 20 days ago. Since then, they have been taking care of the boy’s medical needs out of their own pocket.
 
 “We urged the district collector to help us to provide proper medical care to our son until he recovers well. The wounds are yet to heal,” he said, adding that a few like-minded people and philanthropists had come forward and extended financial aid after they came to know of the boy’s condition and their financial status.
 
 “He is still suffering from pain and is not able to sleep during night,” he said, adding that the collector assured them to look into their problem and help the family.
