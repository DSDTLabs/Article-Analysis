LUCKNOW: When   Ram Naik returned after addressing the convocation function of   on Saturday, he had created a record of addressing 23   in a year. No governor of the state has done so before. 

 Uttar Pradesh has 29 state universities. Of these, 25 have Naik as their chancellor and the remaining four are in the state government’s control. 
 
 Of these 25 universities, Naik has chaired the functions in 23. The convocations of the remaining two universities would be held by the end of next month.
 
 Naik said that after taking over as governor, the student community and holding convocations in every state university on time were among his priority.
 
 “Earlier, students of universities failed to get their degrees and awards as there were no convocations. Hardly one or two were organised in a year,” lamented the governor, who is the ex-officio chancellor of the state universities.
 
 As a result, 23 convocations have already been held — something which has never happened in the past.
 
 Meanwhile, while returning from Gorakhpur on Saturday, the governor had a chance meeting with chief minister  , who was flying from Amausi airport for his Gorakhpur tour.
