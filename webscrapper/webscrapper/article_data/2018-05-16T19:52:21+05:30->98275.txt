 : My mother manages everything that I do. She is the filmi   who manages my dates, finances, scripts and even my tantrums. I’m not someone who can talk showbiz jargons and language, so my mother does that. She is the one who listens to all my scripts along with me and gives me her take and inputs for the same. She manages my dates, which is quite a task, given that I juggle films and television. She is the one who okays my appearances for events and, of course, takes care of my finances.
 
 : My   wasn’t surprised when I told her that academics wasn’t for me and that I wanted to pursue acting. When I went to Mumbai for acting school, she told me just one thing — that fame and success are temporary, and that what one requires is drive and passion towards the craft to sustain a career. I didn’t understand the importance of that then, but it sunk in later. She is the one who has always motivated me, during good times and bad, and was one of the reasons for me taking up the serial on small screen, which has brought me fame and success.
