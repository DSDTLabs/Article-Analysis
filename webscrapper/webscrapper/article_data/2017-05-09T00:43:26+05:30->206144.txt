New Delhi: A fortnight after a reckless teenager drove over four footpath dwellers, killing one and injuring three others near Kashmere Gate, one of the injured men succumbed to his injuries last week. Police have booked the accused driver for culpable homicide instead of causing death due to negligence. 

 Police say that the   who succumbed to the injuries, Asif (28), was stuck under the car when it rode over him on the footpath near the Iron Bridge on the Ring Road. However, instead of stopping the vehicle, the driver had tried to drive off the footpath. In the process, he reversed and forwarded the i20 car several times, crushing the victims.
 
 Police said that he accused, 18-year-old Samarth Chugh, was driving without a licence. The car owner has claimed that he was unaware that the teenager would be driving the vehicle. 
 
 Meanwhile cops are yet to identify the other victims.
 
 On April 20, Chugh had convinced his friends to go for a joyride in his father's car. Family members said that the three youths, all of whom are in the same class at a prominent school in south Delhi, had gathered at Model Town to prepare for a entrepreneurship subject examination, which is scheduled for April 29.
 
 Chugh told the police that he went to his friendâ€™s house at 9pm and informed his parents that he would return home by 11am the next day. After studying at a stretch for the exam, he had convinced his friends to go on a joyride with him in the car.
