It is no secret that Chennaiites love to party. And this weekend   that was hosted at a popular watering hole in the city saw several people turn up in their fashionable best. DJ Charan spun some popular Bollywood songs that got people grooving like there was no tomorrow. On the fashion quotient, we liked how people looked both fashionable and comfortable, in their outfits. 

 While some chose to wear dresses, a few other resorted to tops and trousers. We particularly liked Mistyâ€™s figure-hugging blue dress. Olga, too, looked cute in a short, floral number.   and   turned up in colour-coordinated outfits. Their orange tops sure set the dance floor ablaze. Lisa, who made a statement with her distressed jeans, paired it with an off-shoulder top. Looks like comfort is the key for namma Chennaiites.
