LUCKNOW: Urging the members of   to be part of UP government’s programmes to organise games, cultural progammes and plantation drives right to the block level, chief minister   said such programmes would be the best way to pay a tribute to Deen Dayal Upadhayay’s ideology of welfare of all. 

 Speaking at ‘Khelo Bharat Abhiyan’, a programme where BJYM would regularly organise games and tournaments up to the block level to increase connect of sportspersons with the party throughout the country, Yogi also asked deputy CM Dinesh Sharma to make a proposal as early as possible.
 
 He said India was a youth power and that was the reason why China was upset with India.
 
 Earlier, deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the party had already won 42% vote share in both Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections and urged BJYM workers to target a bigger victory in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. 
 
 He also gave a new slogan: “Sau mein saathh hamara, baaki mein karo batwara”, meaning 60% vote share in 2019 should go to   and the rest be divided among others.
 
 Deputy CM Sharma urged the CM to name the auditorium at Scientific Convention Centre, where the programme was being held, after former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 
 
 Addressing the gathering, national BJYM chief   said the situation at the event was like an India vs Pakistan match. Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma are like Rahul Dravid and Virendra Sehwag, Mahajan said, explaining that though people want Dravid and Sehwag to bat well, they impateintly wait for Sachin Tendulkar (read Aditya Nath Yogi) to come on the field.
