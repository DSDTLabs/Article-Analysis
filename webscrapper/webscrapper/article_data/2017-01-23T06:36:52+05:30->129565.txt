LUCKNOW: Terming   as a sham, BSP chief   on Sunday said the ruling party has lost the right to make any promises. She said the SP needs to introspect whether it fulfilled the promises made to people in 2012 assembly elections. 

 "The SP leadership is befooling UP people through the manifesto and trying to cover up its failures," Mayawati said. She said that people will not fall in the trap and will teach a lesson to the  . 
 
 Mayawati also took a potshot at SP for taking elephant's name -- BSP election symbol -- while releasing the manifesto. The BSP supremo accused the SP leadership of restricting development to just one family, one particular caste and one particular area. "This kind of development does not mean development of the entire state," she said. 
 
 BSP boss said the SP only resorted to publicity and propaganda of the so-called development work while the state reeled under law and order crisis and communal riots. She said if the Samajwadi Party was serious about governance it should have put behind all goons and mafia behind the bars."
