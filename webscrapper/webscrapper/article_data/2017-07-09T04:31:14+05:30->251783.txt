GHAZIABAD: A 13-year-old   IX girl student was   with a surgical blade by a man, who was not known to her, near her house in Nandgram on Saturday evening.

 The girl received a deep cut on her right cheek and her right hand during the attack and was rushed to  , where she was discharged after first aid.
 
 According to Sudhir Bharadwaj, her father, the girl had gone out to buy something from one of the shops near her house. “She told us that she saw a man, wearing a blue shirt, staring at her. On her way back from the store, the man attacked her with a blade,” he said.
 
 The girl initially thought that he had slapped her, but when she came back home her parents saw her bleeding. “I immediately went outside but the man was nowhere to be seen,” Bharadwaj said.
 
 The parents said that the stretch in front of their house was infested with alcoholics and drug addicts at night and the accused must have been one of them.
 
 An FIR has been registered under relevant sections of IPC against the unknown miscreant at the Sihani Gate police station.
