AURANGABAD: Hundreds of followers of Dr B R Ambedkar on Tuesday resorted to dharna andolan here in front of the Aurangabad divisional commissionarate demanding the government to take appropriate action against the chief information commissioner   for allegedly demolishing the historic and iconic Dr   in Mumbai. 

 Leaders of various Ambederkarite parties, social activists and followers raised slogans against the state government for allegedly trying to surpress the voice of   leaders. The agitator also presented a charter of demand to the divisional commissioner. 
 
 Dinkar Onkar, one of the agitators, said that the government should ask   to step down with immediate effect. “Gaikwad has played a key role in demolition of Dr Ambedkar Bhavan by hurting the sentiments of people across the country,” he said. 
 
 Onkar also said that the people from various places are raising similar demands.
 
 Another Ambederkarite leader, Ramrsh khandagale, said, “The state government is favouring   for no reason. People who are agitating against the senior bureaucrat within the democratic framework are being harassed. They are being sent behind the bars. It is nothing but an attempt on the part of the state government to surpress the voice of dalits.”
