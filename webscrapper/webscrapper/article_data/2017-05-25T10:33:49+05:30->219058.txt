HYDERABAD: Amid escalating tension between the BJP and TRS,   chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday demanded an apology from BJP national president Amit Shah for spreading 'blatant lies' about the state. 

 "How dare he (Amit Shah) belittle Telangana and talk against it by standing on this land. He has to tender an apology to the people of Telangana before leaving the state. Otherwise, Telangana society will not forgive him. This is a matter of self-respect of all Telangana people," said the chief minister.
 
  was responding to statements by the BJP chief made during his three day visit to   wherein he had claimed that Telangana was not implementing any of the central schemes despite being provided funds for the same. 
 
 The trigger for this charge was the absence of   (IHHL) in the homes Amit Shah visited in Nalgonda, a scheme that is centrally funded. The BJP chief, whose three-day tour of Telangana began on May 22, is slated to leave Hyderabad for   on Thursday morning.
