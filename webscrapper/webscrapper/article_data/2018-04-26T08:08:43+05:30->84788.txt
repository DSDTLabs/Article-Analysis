BENGALURU: In T20 cricket, there are few sights which are more awe-inspiring than watching an on-song AB de Villiers. 

 
 
 
 
 
 On Wednesday night, in an electric innings, the 34-year-old slammed a racy 30-ball 68 (2x4; 8x6) to power Royal Challengers Bangalore to a competitive 205, their highest score of the season, in a high-voltage clash against Chennai Super Kings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 It still wasn’t enough, though, as   came up with his own special blend of power hitting.
 
 Chasing a stiff 206 for victory,   were caught on the wrong foot early, after they were reduced to 74/4 largely due to the fine efforts of pacer Umesh Yadav (1/23) and tweaker Yuzvendra Chahal. But a 53-ball, 101-run fifth-wicket stand between   (82; 53b, 3x4, 8x6) and skipper Dhoni (70; 34b, 1x4, 7x6) took the game away from the hosts. With that, CSK regained the top spot in the standings, while RCB remained at sixth in the leaderboard.
 
 Needing 16 runs off the last over, CSK coasted home with two balls to spare. Rayudu and Dhoni took the fight to the opposition and exploited RCB’s bowlers’ lack of consistency in the death overs as CSK won by five wickets.
 
 Earlier, giving ABD company in a 53-ball 103 second-wicket partnership was opener Quinton de Kock, with a well-paced 53 (37b; 1x4, 4x6). For the second time in six matches, the South African duo came to the party with skipper Virat Kohli (18; 15b, 3x4), who was sent out to bat by Dhoni, back in the dugout early. On a relatively dry wicket at the M Chinnaswamy stadium, the ABD-Quinton show began rather cautiously. 
 
 But once ABD gets going, there is no stopping him. He warmed up against a seasoned Harbhajan Singh, scoring 16 runs off three balls in the sixth over.
