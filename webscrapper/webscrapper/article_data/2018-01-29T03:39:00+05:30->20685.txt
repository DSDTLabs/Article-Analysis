Margao:   gram sabha on Sunday passed a resolution opposing the proposed hike in tariff of energy consumption by the state electricity department. Gram sabha members demanded that the panchayat file its objections against the proposal with the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) forthwith. 

 Terming the hike as “unfair” and “unjustified”, members pointed out that the department failed to perform as per the standards laid down by the electricity board. They also demanded an explanation from the department over its failure to implement various measures suggested by the JERC in the past. tnn
