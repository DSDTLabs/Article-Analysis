LUDHIANA: A constable deployed as a gunman with a superintendent of police allegedly shot himself dead in his government accommodation on Club Road. His body was found late on Monday night when neighbours complained of foul smell emanating from his quarter and informed the senior officers. 

 The deceased has been identified as   Singh, 30. He was attached with SP Paramjeet Singh Pannu, deployed at PPA Phillaur. According to police, the constable accidentally shot himself with his service weapon, AK-47, on Sunday. However, there is no one who can claim to have heard the shot.
 
 On Monday night, neighbours complained of foul smell coming from his room. They knocked the door and got no response. On receiving information, ADCP-III Gurpreet Kaur  , ACP (West) Gurpreet Singh and division 8 police personnel reached the spot.
 
 The police broke open the door and found his body. He was in uniform and lying on a couch. His service rifle was placed next to his body.   Purewal said, “The incident seems to be of Sunday night. He looks ready in his uniform and shoes. It seems he accidentally shot himself. His family has given a statement that he was not stressed.”
 
 The neighbours claimed that Manpreet had a fight with his wife   on Saturday, after which he dropped her and their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter to his in-law’s house in Malerkotla.
 
 However, the ADCP said there was no such fight and the police investigation has not found any reason for Manpreet committing suicide. 
 
 On the statement of the family, the police have initiated proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPC. The constable had been deployed with the SP for the past one year.
 
 This is the second such incident in the past 23 days. Earlier on March 24, a head constable,  , in-charge guard at police lines, had shot himself. He had suffered a bullet injury in his stomach and was rushed to a hospital. He was discharged after treatment.
