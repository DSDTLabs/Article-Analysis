He further informed that about 196 students were caught while committing malpractices during summer exams last year. Shukla however refused to provide information regarding number of question papers cancelled on account of accidental or other forms of leakage.
 
 TOI, in its November 2 edition, reported about NU cancelling 214 exams where no student appeared in winter 2015 and summer 2016 exams. The students failed to appear in many of them since years, but NU continued to waste its precious manpower and resources along with the time and money in the entire exercise.
 
 It included, engaging paper setters and moderators to prepare three question sets, printing them, their distribution at various centres spread across four districts and even at Bhusawal, fixing exam centre and appointing invigilators for these exam, among others.
 
 Pro-VC Pramod Yeole stated that they framed a policy where they decided to cancel any exam where students failed to appear in five attempts comprising summer and winter. “Still, there are many exams which would be cancelled, once we get confirmation that no examinee turned up for it. It happens sometimes that some of them skip a couple of attempts and then reapply for it.”
 
 He added that NU had decided to act tough from now onwards and wouldn’t be allowing the students to appear in any exams after three attempts. “We will provide them absorption scheme but wouldn’t conduct the exams once it is cancelled,” he said.
 
 To another query by Kolarkar, NU informed that highest number absentees were recorded in last year’s summer exams where over 10,000 did not appear. The number of those skipping the exams is on constant rise in last five years.
