MUMBAI: The HC on Wednesday directed   to forthwith make arrangements to medically terminate the almost 25-week pregnancy of a 16-year-old rape survivor after her mother consented to it. The legal limit for abortion is 20 weeks. 

 The girl was raped by a relative. On May 7, after the mother said the foetus should be delivered, a vacation bench of Justices Anil Menon and Bharati Dangre gave her a day to do a re-think. Her advocate, Meenaz Kakalia, said that after consulting the medical social worker and a panel of doctors, the mother has conveyed her decision to go ahead with abortion. The judges said the mother said her hesitance was only with regard to the reaction of other family members.
 
 The bench referred to the May 7 report of the medical board of Rajawadi Hospital, where the survivor is admitted, which stated that that she will be able to undergo the procedure. "There is nothing in the report that indicates any shortfall in the examinations to be conducted prior to the actual procedure," it said. 
 
 Advocate Girish Godbole, representing the  , said it would be better if abortion was conducted at KEM Hospital, which is better equipped to cope with an emergency. The judges directed the survivor's transfer to KEM Hospital immediately.
