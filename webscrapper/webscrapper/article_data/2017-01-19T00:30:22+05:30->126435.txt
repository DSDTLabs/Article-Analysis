Indore: Indore’s feat of carrying out the first cadaver liver transplant surgery in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday has a history behind it. The preparations for the surgery had been on at Choithram Hospital for the last six to seven months. Hospital doctors, led by Dr Ajay Kumar Jain, collaborated with a team of doctors from Fortis Hospital, Delhi, led by Dr Amitabh Shrivastav, to harvest the liver from Chandrapal’s body and transplant it successfully into Ajay Agrawal (60). Agrawal was suffering from a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and urgently needed a transplant. Dr Jain said the surgery went well as planned. The operation was carried out in a special operation theatre that was developed for the transplantation. “The patient was shifted to a special ICU and was kept under care,” he said. Choithram Hospital had been working on preparing for liver transplantation for the last six to seven months, said Dr Jain. He added that the surgery staff was trained to handle post-operative procedures. “We have a dedicated OT and ICU for the transplant surgery now,” he said, adding that the blood products that are required for the surgery are also developed here itself. The surgical team included doctors Vineet Gautam, Sudesh Sarda, Nitin Sharma, Neeraj Gupta, Ratan Sahajpal, Rupayan, Satish Pathak, Priyanka Bhagat and Alka Jain.
