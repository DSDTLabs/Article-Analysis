Bengaluru: The mounting poll heat has cast a shadow on the ongoing budget session of the state legislature. The business advisory committee (BAC) of the legislative assembly on Tuesday decided to curtail the scheduled 12-day session by three days to make way for election campaign, drawing sharp criticism from the BJP. Visveshwar Hedge Kageri, who was in the chair, made this announcement in the assembly soon after a meeting of the BAC. Under the new schedule, the assembly will end on February 23 instead of February 28. Later, chief minister Siddaramaiah said they had requested the speaker to curtail the session to enable Congress legislators to attend the second leg of Janashirwad yatra of AICC president Rahul Gandhi next week. Opposition leader Jagadish Shettar, who is also a member of the BAC, said he recorded his dissenting note and walked out of the meeting. He said the government was trying to “suppress the voice of the opposition which wanted to take up several issues concerning the people in the house.” JD(S) leaders alleged that the government was trying to “run away” from debate.
