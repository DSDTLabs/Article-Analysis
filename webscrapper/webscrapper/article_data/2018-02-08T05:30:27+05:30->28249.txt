MUMBAI: Central Railway said it has recovered over Rs 2 lakh from the ticket-checker who had misappropriated Rs 43 lakh collected as fines from unauthorized travellers. 

 B R Vaidya, who has been placed under suspension for failure to deposit the fine amount with the commercial department since 2015, has already been served a chargesheet. 
 
 CR issues receipt books to collect excess fare ticket (EFT) amount. CR was able to detect the fraud after a random check found a mismatch in the records.
 
 "We have recovered around Rs 2.5 lakh. He fails to pay the balance, we will deduct the amount from his retirement benefit fund," said an official. "We have a strong case against him...he will be dismissed from service."
 
 Sources said Vaidya's wife, who too is a ticket-checker, was unaware about his wrongdoing. The CR official said, "We had initially wanted to register an FIR, but the legal department advised us that once a case is filed,   will take over the probe."
 
 CR officials claimed they would complete the probe faster than any "outside agency". "The inquiry and dismissal proceeding will be completed within two months. After his dismissal, an FIR will be lodged so that he can be tried for cheating." Chief ticket inspectors D S   and S N   and head ticket examiner   have also been issued major penalty chargesheets for slack supervision.
 
 CR officials said they are looking using technology for fine collection and keeping records as the existing system has too much of manual intervention.
