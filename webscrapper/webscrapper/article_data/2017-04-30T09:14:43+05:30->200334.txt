The   predicted a crushing victory for the BJP in the   and the results matched that trend. So it might seem like the pollsters got it more or less right. But the reality is that they got what they actually measure horribly wrong but were saved by seat forecasts that weren’t wildly off the mark.

 Exit polls actually measure voting intentions, that is which party is getting what vote share, and then try and convert that into votes. But the two exit polls for the MCD elections gave the BJP a vote share that was way higher than what the party actually got when the results were out.
 
 The India Today-Axis poll predicted that the BJP would win 43% of votes in the three municipal corporations put together, with its share varying between 41% in the North and 44% in the South and East. The ABP News-CVoter poll gave even higher vote shares to the BJP – from a minimum of 49.2% in the South to 52.3% in the North.
 
 The actual vote shares bagged by the saffron party varied between 34.9% in the South and 38.6% in the East to total 36.1% for all three corporations. That means the Axis poll got the figure wrong by about 7 percentage points and the CVoter poll by nearly 15 percentage points. Those are not small errors.
 
 Not surprisingly, both pollsters underestimated the AAP vote shares, though not by as large a margin. The Axis poll put it at 24% and CVoter at 18.6% while it actuall;y won 26.2% of the votes. Interestingly, the error in the case of the Congress was on either side of the actual number. The Axis poll overestimated the party’s shares while the CVoter poll consistently underestimated it, but again not by huge margins.
 
 Fortunately for the pollsters, the gap between the BJP and AAP or Congress was so huge that these errors did not matter too much when it came to seat tallies. Thus, against the 200-plus seats that both had predicted, the BJP won 181, which seemed close enough for them to get away with the impression that they had gauged the vote right.
