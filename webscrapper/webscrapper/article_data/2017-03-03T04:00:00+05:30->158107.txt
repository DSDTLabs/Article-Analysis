Ahmedabad: The state government-appointed Justice Akshay Mehta fee regulatory committee (FRC) met representatives of self-financed   colleges on Thursday. They pointed out to the FRC that while there are three sets of fees for medical colleges — NRI quota, management seats, general seats — there is only one fee structure for engineering colleges. The association requested a similar fee arrangement for private engineering colleges, to improve infrastructure there. Most colleges, the members claimed, are ranked by legitimate accreditation bodies, and they were eligible to charge fees based on the quality of education imparted.

 The FRC heard the president of the association of the state’s self-financed colleges Janak Khandwala. For years, there has been a demand for including representatives from student and parents associations in the body. “There has been a demand from bodies of students and parents to include them in FRC meetings. A written submission has been already made,” says a senior member of the association.
