NAGPUR: MNS leader Moreshwar Dhote’s son Pankaj, externed from city in the past, is now on the run.

 Gittikhadan police have registered an offence of attempt to murder against him for firing on gangster Sumeet Thakur’s close aide Raju Wankhede in front of   near   square on Wednesday. Gittikhadan police team is learnt to be fast zeroing in on   who may have fled outside the city to evade arrest. 
 
 Dhote is learnt to have barged into Shambhu canteen before ransacking the place after learning Wankhede was present there. Wankhede managed to evade being shot by Dhote but his car was damaged as the bullet aimed at him entered the vehicle shattering the rear glass. Police later recovered the bullet from the car. An empty shell too was found from the place.
 
 Police sources claimed that Dhote, who was drunk at the time, had also fired one shot in the air. As the local residents started raising an alarm, Dhote fled from the place. Dhote, a rival of Thakur and his gang, had been heard by the passers-by issuing threat to the rival gangster. Sources said Dhote is keen to eliminate Thakur, released last month from jail where he was sent after being arrested under MCOCA, for sheltering Wankhede. Dhote had a monetary dispute with Thakur. 
 
 Zonal DCP Rakesh Ola said Dhote would soon be nabbed as teams were chasing him. “It is only after Dhote’s arrest that the nature of dispute between him and Wankhede would be clearer,” he said.
