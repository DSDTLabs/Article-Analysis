HYDERABAD: A green space measuring 600 square yards at   near   is faced with the   and the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s (GHMC’s) apathy is to blame for this, locals say.

 About six years ago, civic authorities approved a proposal by locals to come up with a model park on the land, with demarcated space for joggers and a children’s gaming zone. However, no work has been started here so far. This, despite several representations.
 
 Eight pieces of lands were approved for development of parks and beautification work. “Only one piece was converted into a model park, while the rest are lying neglected. Park No 21 faces encroachment threat,” said Rajendra Prasad, secretary, Sanjeevani Hills welfare society. This green space is now a waste land full of weeds and snakes and mosquitoes are also aplenty.
 
 Prasad said, “Even after the assistant director of horticulture, Rajendranagar circle, visited the place, the project has not gained momentum.”
