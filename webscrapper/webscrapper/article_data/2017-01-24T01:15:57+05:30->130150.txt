Lucknow: With ‘Make in India’ as inspiration, medal winners at AKTU’s convocation want to turn entrepreneurs and launch their own startups. 

 A Btech student from Government Engineering College, Banda, Himanshu Tiwari has designed an android-based application which can ease online transactions. “The application will also be helpful in bill-splitting. For example, if two friends want to jointly pay a restaurant bill, the payment can be divided online. Generally, the payment is made by one and the other one pays his share in cash,” said Himanshu, IT gold medalist. “After its final testing on our college campus, we will be making the app available for free on google play,” he added. Other IT graduates are also working on devices and applications that promote a cashless economy. “I want to launch a startup that will provide applications and tools to help the country go cashless,” said silver medalist Nidhi Sinha.
 
 Gold medalist in fashion designing Shelja Sharma’s startup would popularise khadi. “I would design western wear in khadi,” she said.
