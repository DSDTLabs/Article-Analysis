CHANDIGARH: Alarmed after finding a large number of false cases being registered under the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in the past eight months during investigations, the senior functionaries of   have issued an advisory to the field offices to review such incidents.

 As per the data accessed by TOI, around one fourth of cases registered by   police under the   from January 1 to August 31 have been found to be ‘untrue during probe’ and thus cancelled. Out of 539 cases registered during this period, 117 cases were found false. In nine cases, the accused were acquitted. The remaining cases are either put up before the court, or are under trial or under investigation.
 
 Sources confirmed that the investigating officers have found that in several cases the complainants were found settling personal scores by giving to an otherwise ordinary dispute, the colour of an alleged atrocity under the act.
 
 When contacted, ADGP (HR & litigation) O P Singh said, “At this stage it would be difficult to say that the act is being misused. However, the issue requires close examination because the provisions of the acts are meant to protect the lot of the exploited sections.”
 
 “Special advisory has been issued to the superintendents of police (SPs) and the inspector generals of police (IGPs) to review the circumstances under which sections of SC/ST act were initially applied and were subsequently omitted. They have also been asked to review the orders of acquittal and approach the higher courts in appeals, if required,” Singh added.
 
 He further stated that the SPs and IGPs have also been asked to give an action taken report (ATR) by October 1 after carrying out the review of these cases.
 
 Advisory also includes holding meetings with public prosecutors and to ensure that ‘pairivi’ (pleadings) in the under trial cases is done cautiously and to expedite the investigation of cases and put them for trial before the court.
