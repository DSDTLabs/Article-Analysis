KOCHI: The high court on Tuesday allowed the state government to issue the final notification regarding   working in private hospitals.

 The court disposed of sa petition filed by   (KPHA) challenging the proposed hike in minimum wages by the state government. The court has also vacated a stay issued by it earlier.
 
 In the order, the court has specified that the notification being issued by the government should be in accordance with the provisions of Minimum Wages Act of 1948. The court has also allowed the government to hold mediation talks between hospital managements and nurses’ unions if required. Those who have further opposition to the final notification can approach the court, the court said.
 
 KPHA had alleged in the petition that the government is hastily trying to implement the proposal to raise minimum wages by 150%. More than 400 hospitals have filed objections to the proposal and has pointed out serious infirmities but the government has granted only two days to consider the objections. This would make the whole exercise an empty formality, KPHA had contended.
 
 While considering the petition earlier, the court had directed for mediation. When the case came up on Tuesday, the court asked for the result of the mediation. A counsel representing KPHA told the court that the issues could not be resolved in the mediation held on March 28. Labour commissioner also filed a report stating that no consensus could be arrived at the mediation meeting.
 
 At Tuesday’s court hearing, the hospital managements argued that the   had directed the central government for forming a committee to specify wages and other matters of nurses. In such a scenario, the state government’s move is unwarranted.
 
 State government counsel submitted that the SC decision was regarding the working conditions and other matters of nurses. After considering the submissions, the court allowed the government to issue the final notification on minimum wages.
