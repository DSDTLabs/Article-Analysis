NEW DELHI: The equity markets on Wednesday extended its downward trend as the stocks succumbed under selling pressure after army struck on the   border.

 The 30-share BSE   lost a whopping 439.95 points to close on 39,159.81 and 50-share NSE   closed on 9,739.25, down by 132.25 points. Both the benchmark indices lost above 1.3 per cent during the day's trade.
 
 A lower close on Wednesday marked the longest losing streak for the indices after a seven-day fall that ended on December 22, 2016. 
 
 The markets had opened on a positive note with both Sensex and Nifty making gains in early trade. But both started losing soon and Sensex came down by 250 points by mid-day. As the news of an army strike on Myanmar border broke out, the markets were gripped further in negative sentiment and Sensex hit intra-day low of 31,100.80, down by 498.96 points.
 
 The stock market has reeled since last week with geopolitical tensions, weak macroeconomic data and outflow of foreign funds taking its toll.
 
 Foreign investors have net sold $777 million worth of Indian shares so far this month. They sold nearly $2 billion worth of equities in August as stretched valuations and simmering   tensions saw foreign investors pulling out.
 
 "One reason why the markets were being buoyant in the recent months was because the dollar was weakening and (on expectation) that the Fed would tone down its normalization process, but that seems to be reversing" said Dhananjay Sinha, Head of Research, Economy and Strategy at Emkay Global Financial Services.
 
 On Wednesday, the pharma and PSU Bank stocks bled the most with respective sectoral indices losing 3 per cent each.
