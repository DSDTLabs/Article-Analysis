Nagpur: The   den busted by the Lakadganj police in Wardhaman Nagar on Wednesday evening is probably the first in the city where the gamblers used a gaming app simultaneously on 7-8 mobile devices to earn maximum points against players at different locations. 

 The gang, which operated from a rented flat, was formed by a Wardha-based engineering dropout who employed 11 workers from his native place on a monthly salary to play the game. Cops seized 105 mobile devices along with other material, totally worth Rs10.87lakh, during the raid. 
 
 Apart from mastermind Ankush Panjwani, 28, others accused have been identified as Ravi Nanvani, 19, Aniket Dhole, 18, Badal Bawne, 18, Gajendra Fating, 19, Mangesh Mahakalkar, 25, and their accomplices. Police have registered the offence under Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act against them.
 
 Senior PI Santosh Khandekar informed gamblers downloaded gaming app ‘Three Cards’ on Android devices. “Each accused played simultaneously on seven to eight mobiles. Every gambler would buy 1,000 coins for Rs60 to play the game,” he said. 
 
 Lakadganj police were informed by their counterparts in Wardha that in 2016, Ankush’s brother Mohit was caught in a similar case and 200 mobile devices were seized in the raid. 
 
 The 11 accused told cops that Ankush brought them to the city a month back for gambling for which they were being paid a monthly salary. Ankush has provided them accommodation along with other basic amenities. 
 
 Police said, Ankush had rented a flat owned by Nilesh Dhingara who was unaware about the illegal activities. The action was taken under the guidance of zone III DCP Rahul Makhnikar. Further probe is underway.
