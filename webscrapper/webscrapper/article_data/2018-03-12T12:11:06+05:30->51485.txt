PANAJI: The internationally-reputed non-profit wing of Iskcon, Akshaya Patra, was to begin supply of midday meals on a pilot basis in Goa’s schools from June 2018. But state officials inform that introduction of   meals is unlikely to begin from June, as scheduled, for over 6,000 students of the   school complex.

 Though this pilot project has received the state government’s in-principal approval for implementation, the logistics may not be finalised in time to begin the meals’ supply by June.
 
 It was earlier agreed that Akshaya Patra would be provided land by the state government in close proximity to the Cujira school complex to operate a community kitchen from. But officials said that though land has been identified for the kitchen, the formalities of acquiring it are expected to take time to complete.
 
 This will mean that supply of midday meals to Cujira school complex by the local women’s self-help groups is likely to continue when the schools reopen for the academic year 2018-19. 
 
 The midday meals by Akshaya Patra may begin later in the academic year.
 
 Talks between the state government and Akshaya Patra had begun in 2013 with a view to improve the quality of midday meals served to school students. Presently, 109 women’s self-help groups supply midday meals to students across Goa, but there have been cases of alleged food poisoning during the course of almost every academic year. 
 
 The monitoring body of the Union human resource development ministry had also found in the past that food served in the sample schools surveyed were either cold or quantities were insufficient.
