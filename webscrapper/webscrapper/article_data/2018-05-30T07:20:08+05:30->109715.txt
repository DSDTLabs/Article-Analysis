BENGALURU:   is back to looking green — and not from envy. A large part of the lake, one of the city's best known landmarks, is covered by  , so much so that it resembles a lush carpet of green. Until a week ago, the lake sparkled with fairly clean water, but no longer.

 
 Beginning from the side of the lake closest to the Ganapathy Temple on Annaswamy Mudaliar Road, the hyacinth extends to one of the several islands dotting the lake.
 
 “The hyacinth covered only 10% of the lake a week ago,” said Colonel Ravinder Singh, who works out of a building opposite the lake. “The authorities had built a sort of barrier next to the naala to stop sewage from flowing into the lake. When it rained heavily a few days ago, the water level rose and the sewage overflowed. The hyacinth then spread like a wildfire.”
 
 The BBMP, the caretaker of the lake, says a tender will be floated to maintain the waterbody. “Due to the poll code of conduct, the tender process was delayed,” said an engineer working in the BBMP's lake department. “We will call for tenders by June 16, and the hyacinth will be cleared by July. It has probably increased due to sewage mixing with rainwater.” However, the   ( ), which was tasked with building a sewage treatment plant (STP) with a capacity of 2MLD at the lake, claims no sewage is entering the lake.
 
 BS Jayalakshmi, executive engineer, BWSSB, said, “One of the two pipelines is ready and 1MLD of sewage is being treated. When it rains, water mixed with dust and garbage from the roads enters the lake, and this might be a possible reason for the spread of the hyacinth.”
