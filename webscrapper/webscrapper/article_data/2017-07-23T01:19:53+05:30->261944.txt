NAVI MUMBAI: A spat between activists seems imminent over identical sounding names, as a new   called ‘Awaaj Foundation’ has earned the ire of activist  , founder of the well-known  . 

 “I have written to the authorities, including the CM’s office, stating it was unethical to start an NGO which has an almost identical name as mine. They zeroed in on ‘Awaaj’ in which just the last letter (j) is different from my NGO’s name. While verbally saying this, many people get confused as to which NGO is being referred to,” said Abdulali. The   said she would seek legal options if the issue was not resolved soon.
 
 Activist  , who has started the new NGO, told TOI: “I have strictly gone by the laws to register my NGO, Awaaj Foundation, in Thane district this year. Sumaira ma’am’s NGO is registered in Mumbai, hence, technically it is allowed to have another NGO with a different spelling in another district.”
 
 However, Abdulali countered: “My NGO has been very active over the last decade fighting against noise pollution and illegal sand mining in Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Konkan regions. Recently, he held a press conference in Mumbai but many mistook that I was organizing it. This is ridiculous.”
 
 Mishra said he was ready for a legal fight if required.
