AHMEDABAD: City police detained four supporters of Jignesh   for trying to prevent the BJP MP from Ahmedabad West, Kirit Solanki, from paying tribute to Babasaheb Ambedkar at Sarangpur on his 127th birth anniversary.

 Just after the recent Bharat Bandh by Dalit organizations, Mevani had earlier this month said that he will not allow BJP workers and leaders to pay homage to Babasaheb. 
 
 Later, he softened his stand and said his supporters may protest but should not resort to violence.
 
 For the first time in years, there were huge queues at Sarangpur to garland the statue of Babasaheb. Supporters of Jignesh Mevani raised slogans and showed placards jeering at Solanki when he went to garland the statue.
 
 Meanwhile, in Mehsana, supporters of Mevani rushed to purify a statue of Ambedkar after deputy CM Nitin Patel had garlanded it. They were detained when they were trying to purify the statue with milk.
 
 Chief minister Vijay Rupani paid tribute to Ambedkar before the statue at   in Gandhinagar. He said Babasaheb has given us the Constitution which ensures equal rights and justice to all and the government is committed to protect it.
