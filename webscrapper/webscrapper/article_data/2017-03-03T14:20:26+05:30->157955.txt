MARGAO: The   (AGBROA), at its meeting held on Thursday, has decided to approach the state chief secretary or the excise commissioner to put on hold the implementation of the   order banning liquor vends until it is clear whether   are exempt.

 The association was reacting to the view expressed by the attorney general,   to the Kerala government as cited in media reports that the apex court order doesn’t apply to bars and restaurants serving alcohol.
 
 “We will ask the government to seek clarifications over the court order, and until then, to defer the implementation of the order,” Michael Carrasco, president of AGBROA, told mediapersons after the meeting.
 
 It has also decided to urge the next government to formulate an excise policy that would govern the trade of bar and restaurants. “As the state government will then be able to formulate its own rules conducting the liquor trade, the Supreme Court order would no longer be applicable to Goa,” Carrasco said.
 
 A suggestion to boycott the forthcoming panchayat polls also came up at the meeting, it was informed.
