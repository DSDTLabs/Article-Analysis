JAIPUR: After  , the barricades erected for the smart city project are causing inconvenience to commuters in the   area.

 Traffic was thrown out of gear on Wednesday after a portion of road in   Bazaar caved-in and traffic going from   towards Ajmeri Gate was diverted. Long traffic jams were witnessed in narrow lanes of the walled city area, which connects Chaura Rasta and  .
 
 Rohan Vijay, a resident of walled city area said, “The civic bodies are not carrying out work with proper planning. These works should be done at night and road should be open in morning. Many faced inconvenience as people got stuck for hours due to sudden blockage of arterial road,”
 
 Under the smart road project, the Jaipur Smart City Limited (JSCL) is constructing a ducting in the area. After digging-up road in the walled city area, the JSCL is laying cement blocks for the ducting.
 
 A source at JMC department said, “Small portion of road was caved-in as proper filling of sand was not done. Cracks on the road appeared after heavy vehicles passed through it.”
 
 The project at Kishanpole Bazar was in controversy since its inception. This sudden damage of road has brought more disappointment amongst shopkeepers of walled city area. “Shopkeepers earns daily for their livelihood. Barricading in front of our shops will result in revenue loss. Why should shopkeepers suffer due to negligence of officials? Will JMC compensate our losses?” asked Ramiz, a local shopkeeper.
 
 After the new design of a smart road in Kishanpole was opposed by the shopkeepers, the JSCL has now decided to make alternation. As per latest proposal, a 12.2 meter concrete cement road will be constructed, which will include the parking space. Nearly1.8 meter wide footpath will be constructed two inches below the level of footpath. Similarly, 2.2 meter wide parking space will be constructed and its ground level will be seven inches lower than the footpath.
