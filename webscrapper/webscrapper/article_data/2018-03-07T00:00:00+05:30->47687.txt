A happening   bash was organised by a group of ladies at a private hotel in Gomti Nagar. Since ‘Phulon ki Holi’ was the theme of the party, the venue was decorated with beautiful flowers. After playing Holi with gulaal and flowers, the femme brigade shook a leg on several Holi tracks. The highlight of the party was the Matki ramp walk, where the ladies held a matki and walked the ramp.
