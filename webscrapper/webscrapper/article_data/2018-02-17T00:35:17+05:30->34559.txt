Tirupur: The national commission for scheduled castes (NCSC) vice-chairperson L Murugan received grievance petitions from dalits at KVR Nagar and Nallur in the city on Friday. He was accompanied by collector KS Palanisamy. Many people requested him to address various issues including old age pension, free house patta, public and individual toilets.  Talking to reporters later, Murugan said, “It is important to ensure that dalit children are enrolled in schools. The school education department officials should work on their enrolment.” Dalits should make use of Central government schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Bhima Yojana and state government schemes, he added.
