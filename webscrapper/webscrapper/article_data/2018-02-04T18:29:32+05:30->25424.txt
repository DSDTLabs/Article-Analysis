 “Jitendra stopped the SUV to drop his friends. A police sub-inspector, Vijay Darshan, reached there and slapped Jitendra and asked him to accompany him to the police station for questioning. The policeman snatched SUV’s key when he refused,” Yadav said.
 
 Jitendra got down from the vehicle and took out his mobile phone to inform his family members. Yadav alleged that the police official snatched his mobile phone too. This led to an altercation and the officer opened fire at him.
 
 Jitendra's family has demanded strict action against the accused officer.
 
 Noida SSP Love Kumar said that police have launched an investigation into the matter.
