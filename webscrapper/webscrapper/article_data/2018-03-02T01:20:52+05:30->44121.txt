GREATER NOIDA: The   (YEIDA) board on Thursday finalised the terms of reference for appointing a company to study ways to connect Delhi’s IGI airport, the capital city and the upcoming   in  .

 The YEIDA will now invite companies in the first week of this month to participate in the process. “A company will be selected within a month to put the study in place,” said Arun Vir Singh, the CEO of YEIDA. In January this year, the YEIDA board had approved a proposal asking the National Capital Region Transport Corporation — a joint sector company between the Centre and the states of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and UP mandated for implementing the Regional Rapid Transit System project across the NCR — to study the means of   between the two airports.
 
 “A direct link is needed between the two airports in relation to the two cities of Delhi and Greater Noida. The YEIDA board has given its go-ahead for appointing NCRTC or any other consultant to conduct a study and see what this link should be, whether a rapid rail, underground metro, highways, hyper-loop, pod taxi, mass transport system or something else. Currently, driving between IGI airport and Jewar takes over two hours,” said Singh. “Once we have a study in place, we will move forward on this count,” he said.
 
 Singh further said the aim was to identify the best suited public rapid transport system. “This will be based on demand assessment, public affordability, population, transport network, regional connectivity, traffic data, the NCR planning board plan 2032 and so on,” he said. “The survey that the selected company will undertake will be for the next 20 years and include financial analysis,” he added.
