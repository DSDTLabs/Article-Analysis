CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister   has faced flak from the Opposition over the party performing ‘bhoomi pujan’ for its offices in 11 district headquarters, including Panchkula.

 Khattar performed the ceremony for the new party office at Mansa Devi Complex, Sector 3, Panchkula. He was accompanied by finance minister Captain Abhimanyu, Ambala MP Ratan Lal Kataria, Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta and district party unit chief Deepak Sharma. 
 
 On the other hand, Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar alleged that ‘bhoomi pujan’ had put BJP in the category of those associated with land mafia. “In most of the places where ‘bhoomi pujan’ has been done, land was found to be disputed and it was bought around the days of demonetization in November 2016. This means that after indulging in corruption and wrongdoings, now the party has become a part of mafia engaged in buying and selling of disputed land,” alleged Tanwar.
 
 On the other hand,   said that, “We are moving towards establishing infrastructure of the party across all districts in Haryana. Land for this purpose has already been purchased in 15 districts and BJP offices in all districts would be established soon.”
 
 The BJP office in Panchkula will be set up on 4,000 sq m and will have offices of state president, general secretaries and office-bearers. An auditorium having a capacity of about 600 persons would also be constructed. The work would be completed in 18 months.
