Tirupur: A designer studio-cum-library for viscose staple fibre (VSF) products will be opened soon here to provide training on the handling of viscose yarn and fabrics. Grasim Industries, in association with the Tirupur Exporters’ Association (TEA), will set up the state-of-art-facility. It is important to enlarge the product range from the dollar city, TEA president Raja M Shanmugham told TOI. “While 65% of the global apparel segment belongs to man-made fibres, it would be very difficult for the dollar city to survive if it only continued to bank on cotton fabric products, because many developing countries are picking up in the latter market,” he said.  “With the Liva brand, Grasim Industries is the giant in VSF market and so, when they approached us, we welcomed them with open arms. The garment manufacturers here may be good in handling cotton yarn and fabrics, but not viscose. So, we requested them to educate the manufacturers on VSF before they are able to market it. It would be a win-win situation,” Shanmugham said. Viscose’s wet strength, the strength needed during dyeing and other processes, is lesser compared to cotton and the fabric may swell easily, said head of research and development department, NIFT-TEA College of Knitwear Fashion, CP Senthil Kumar.  “Experience will be needed to handle issues including shrinkage control. Such know-how could be earned from the technical experts at the state-of-art designer studio, where marketing solutions could also be met,” he said. In order to strengthen the supply chain, Grasim Industries will include the yarn/fabric manufacturers and dyeing processors, who works on their knowledge under Liva accredited partner forum (LAPF). “For instance, if a manufacturer needs dyeing processors, who could handle the viscose products better, he could step into the studio and get the details,” said Senthil.
