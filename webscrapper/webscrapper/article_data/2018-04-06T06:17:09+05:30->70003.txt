BENGALURU: Nine people, including four children, were grievously injured when a fire caused by LPG leakage triggered a cylinder blast at a house in Peenya Dasarahalli, northwest Benglauru, in the wee hours of Thursday. 

 Police said eight of the nine injured have sustained more than 75%   and are critical. They are undergoing treatment at Victoria Hospital.
 
 Bagalagunte police said around 4.30am, Devaraju, a security guard at a private firm, returned home from work. His wife Lakshmamma opened the door and switched on the light. That’s when the fire broke out as the   in the house had developed a leak. The fire spread in no time and the cylinder exploded. The main door and windows were shattered and four neighbouring houses also suffered damage. 
 
 Six inhabitants of the house and three others sustained injuries. Devaraju, 38, his wife Lakshmamma, 35, their daughters Niranjan, 7 and Devika, 4, Lakshmamma’s brother Venkatesh, 38 and his wife Maheshwaramma, 35, who were visiting the family, bore the brunt of the impact. Neighbours Honnurappa, 70, Somashekar, 16 and Sangeetha, 16, were the others injured.
 
 All the four children have sustained over 80% burns. Barring Honnurappa, all the others are battling for life, police said. Police said the Devaraju family is from Pavagada in Tumakuru district and had settled in Dasarahalli several years ago. Venkatesh and his wife came from Pavagada to visit them on Wednesday.
 
 Police suspect the LPG stove may not have been turned off, leading to the gas leakage. They have registered a case.
