 and   are all geared up to set the temperatures soaring with 'Disco  ', the first song from '  — Sundar, Susheel, Risky'. The track is a hot, modern take on disco. The dance form, a rage in the 70s and early 80s, makes a comeback in a modern avatar in the action-entertainer, directed by Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK. 
Bosco, who is credited for choreographing chartbusters, including 'Kala Chashma' last year, was roped in for the song that highlights Sidharth and Jacqueline’s chemistry while they burn the dance floor.
 'A Gentleman — Sundar, Susheel, Risky', produced by Fox Star Studios, releases on August 25.
