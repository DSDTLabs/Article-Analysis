CHANDIGARH: Known for its contribution to the discovery of the Higgs boson or God Particle, Panjab University’s only science journal has failed to make it to the University Grants Commission’s approved list for 2018.

 
  
 
 While five journals, including ‘Panjab University   Journal (Science)’, have failed to make it to the list, three, including Panjab University Research Journal (Arts), have made the cut. The   list is required for evaluating the performance of teachers by their published work in the journals. The UGC had come up with the list for the first time, but 4,305 journals were removed based on complaints of poor content. The publications to go off the list also include ‘Parkh’ of the Punjabi department, ‘Parishodh’ of the university press, ‘Dialog’ of the English department, and ‘Journal of the University Institute of Legal Studies’. Members of the faculty will have to own up the journals. If they produce quality papers, the journal becomes high-quality automatically,” said internal quality assurance cell (IQAC) director M Rajivlochan, adding: “The UGC has not given us clarity on the implications, since there is a possibility of a new list’s coming out in six months.”
 
 After the development, the university teachers were caught sharing concerns about the quality of papers and advising the editors to work harder.
