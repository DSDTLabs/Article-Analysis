Visakhapatnam: On the first day of AP Engineering Agricultural and Medical Common Entrance Test (APEamcet-2018), students complained that they could read only one question at a time in the online test, whereas earlier when students wrote the exam they could look at all the questions and decide the ones to answer first.
