TRICHY: The action by the   administration against some of the employees over alleged illegal possession of liquor sparked tension in its warehouse in   on the outskirts of   on Wednesday.

 As many as 50 contractual employees for loading and unloading at the warehouse struck work to protest against the suspension of seven of their colleagues following the seizure of 86 bottles of liquor.
 
 It started after Tasmac officials found the possession of liquor with seven employees and caught them red-handed on April, 13. Upon inquiry, the officials reportedly found that the employees tried to take the liquor bottles from the warehouse illegally. So, the Tasmac administration in Trichy asked them not to report to the duty as punishment.
 
 The issue was viewed seriously by the other employees who came together to protest against the suspension of the staff from the job. The employees refused to load and unload the liquor from the warehouse on Wednesday morning. It was a warehouse for supplying liquor to the Tasmac wine shops in 11 taluks in the district.
 
 The officials from revenue, Tasmac and the police visited the spot and held talks with the protesting employees. The employees stood firm on their demand that the punished employees should be reinstated. But the Tasmac administration refused to give in to their demand. Eventually, the officialsâ€™ team convinced the employees to return to the work on assurance that the final action on the employees will be taken after thorough investigation. 
 
 On the other hand, a complaint was already lodged against the seven employees in the Thuvakudi police about the alleged theft. A case was also registered against them.
