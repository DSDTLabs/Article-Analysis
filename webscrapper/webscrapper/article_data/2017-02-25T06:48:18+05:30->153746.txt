UDAIPUR: The first edition of three-day   kicked off Friday in Gulab Bagh here. 

 Udaipur collector Rohit Gupta inaugurated the event, presented by MA- My Anchor Foundation in association with BRICS Chamber of Commerce & Industry and Rajasthan Tourism. First day of the festival witnessed a host of wonderful storytellers including  , Gautam Mukerjee, VarunNarain, Nadzeda and Team and   who mesmerized the audience through a plethora of genres including fantasy, detective, historical and real life.
 
 The story sessions started with interaction of local schoolchildren with Varun Narain - The Puppeteer and the Russian troupe. The sessions engaged in singing, dancing and playing traditional Russian folk musical instruments for the kids and Varun’s exotic puppets brought to life the dialectic between fantasy and reality. In evening session, Gautam Mukerjee took the audience on a historically significant journey of Padmavati, leaving them gasping for more. 
 
 From a strong female character to a strong female storyteller, Fouzia Dastango’s session was a seamless transition. Being the first woman of Dastangoi, she adapted from a tragi-comic sketch full of dark humour, Nanniki Naanione of Ismat Chughtai’s most moving pieces of writing. Shantanu Guha Ray gripped the audience with his rendition of Urban Murder — real life detective stories.
 
 “Hearing childhood stories from my grandmother to getting inspiration from the story of Chetak, it is exhilarating to interact with these wonderful storytellers, right here in our very own city of Udaipur. Udaipur Tales Festival is a heartfelt effort to provide a platform for the community of passionate storytellers, bringing alive the real impact of stories on individuals and cultures. The intent is to gradually take Udaipur Tales Festival across India and abroad,” Sushmita Shekhar, director of Udaipur Tales Festival said.
