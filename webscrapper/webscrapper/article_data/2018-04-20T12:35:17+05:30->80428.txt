 Satnam Singh Behru, national president of   ( ) said, “The administration failed to provide relief to the farmers, who were being exploited and whose wheat produce were being taken away by the Arhtiyas. The officials took notice and acted against only those defaulting arhtiyas against whom we have submitted the proofs and the matter caught the attention of a number of farmers. However, no case of theft was registered against the accused arhtiyas. The district officials should provide basic amenities to the farmers at the grain markets.”
