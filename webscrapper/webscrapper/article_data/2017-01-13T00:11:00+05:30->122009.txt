Mumbai: The Motor   Claims   last week came down on cops for failing to investigate an incident where a   vehicle driven rashly by an officer dashed into a   and his daughter in Borivli in 2008. Referring to the police station diary, which said that investigations were kept open, the tribunal observed, “But thereafter no steps are taken against the driver of the offending vehicle and so there is force in the submission made on behalf of the applicant that when the offending driver himself was a policeman, other staff members were trying to shield him.”

 The tribunal, while observing that the deposition of the man before it held more weight than the FIR, ordered the State of Maharashtra to pay him a total   of Rs 2.43 lakh along with interest of Rs 1.75 lakh.
 
 The victim, Sitaram Kewat, had suffered 15% partial disability and had severely injured his ankle. In his plea, he told the tribunal that the incident occurred at 1.50pm on November 7, 2008. Kewat said the vehicle abruptly came from Bhagwati Hospital gate in high speed, and without blowing the horn, dashed the motorcycle from behind. The state denied the allegations and said the accident occurred due to Kewat’s rashness and negligence. Stating that the accident was one of contributory negligence, it sought dismissal of the application. 
 
 The police vehicle’s driver told the tribunal that the front portion had touched the left side of the motorcycle and it had fallen. He, however, alleged that while driving out of the hospital at a speed of 10-12kmph, the motorcycle suddenly came and dashed the vehicle. He alleged negligence by Kewat. But the court found contradictions in the statement of the driver and that mentioned in the station diary. It pointed out that Kewat’s statement was not recorded by cops.
