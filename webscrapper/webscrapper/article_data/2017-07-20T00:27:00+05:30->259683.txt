Panaji: Tuesday’s steady, incessant rainfall made the 24-hour period till 8.30am on Wednesday the season’s second wettest spell till date after the southwest monsoon hit Goa on June 8. At 161.4mm, the meteorological centre recorded very heavy rainfall in Valpoi and heavy rainfall at the 12 other rain gauge centres, with four receiving showers over 100mm. The wettest spell of the season on July 14 had yielded 102.3mm of rainfall. The meteorological centre at Altinho, Panaji, also recorded a state weighted average of 94.8mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours.  The heavy precipitation helped reduce the deficit from 14% to 10%, as the seasonal total touched 1414.5mm, against the normal of 1574.0mm. “Heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at a few places till Friday,” said M L Sahu, director, meteorological centre, Altinho. Even as the depression over coastal Odisha and neighbouring areas remained static and developed into a well-marked low pressure area, the offshore trough at mean sea level from south Gujarat coast to north Kerala coast continues to persist. The depression in Odisha, which is likely to move west-northwestward and weaken gradually, coupled with the offshore trough had brought about Tuesday’s torrential showers which caused much damage.
