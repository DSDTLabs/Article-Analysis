AHMEDABAD: That ominous decision of not wearing a helmet while riding a two-wheeler is the cause of the maximum number of road fatalities in Gujarat’s cities. Last year, a road safety research agency studied the nature and reasons of road fatalities in Gujarat, in all of 8,136 victims, a majority were found not wearing helmets or seat belts.

 In Ahmedabad city, nearly 66% road fatality victims were two wheeler riders who never bothered to wear helmets. The agency, Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS), which had studied the two-wheeler accidents had also claimed in its report that 78% of the two-wheeler victims in Ahmedabad who had died were women. The research had found that the risk of road fatality is nearly 2.5 times higher among riders without helmets. 
 
 Last year VS   published a study of 153 road accidents victims from the autopsy registry of its Forensic Medicine and Toxicology Department. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 The study found that young adults of age group 21 to 30 years accounted for maximum cases, 38 of 153, (27.3%). Among them two-wheeler riders accounted for maximum cases, 61 (43.8%). The maximum number of deaths were due to head injuries 49 (35.2%). The study also found most of the victims almost 40 were hit while briefly falling asleep while riding which accounts for 28.7% of the cases.
 
 “Wearing a helmet can reduce the risk of severe injury by 72% and the risk of death by 39%, according to a recent   report. We have found it to be true in case of Ahmedabad as well,” said a senior   traffic official.
 
 The official added, “After 2007-08, Ahmedabad city had seen a fourfold rise in the purchase of bikes, which has not seen any decrease since then. Most of the victims we have seen either suffer a traumatic brain injury ( ) and suffer from a range of problems-from mild concussion to paralysis,” he added.
