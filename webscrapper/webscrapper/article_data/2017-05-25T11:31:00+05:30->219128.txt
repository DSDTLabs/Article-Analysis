HYDERABAD: Nearly two weeks after unravelling the murder of a man, whose body parts were mutilated and sealed inside a wall at a one-room tenement at  , police are still looking for the elusive Jha brothers. 

 The victim is suspected to be one Pradan. On May 11, in a portion of a house rented to Vivek Vidur Jha, 27, and  , 31, both of  , an unidentified person's body, with head and limbs severed, were found. The body parts were concealed in a wall and plastered. 
 
 Initially, police felt one of the two - either Vivek or Bhuvan - could be the victim. Sources in the   police said as both Vivek and Bhuvan were alive, they then suspected that the victim could be one Pradan, also a native of Bihar. The Jha brothers have been arranging labour for various pharmaceutical companies and perhaps the victim was also in contact with them. 
 
 When police were scouting for clues, they came across several photographs at the brothers' house. The accused had kept several Aadhaar cards and identity proof of various persons. While verifying the photos and Aadhaar copies, they traced everyone except Pradan. 
 
 This made police suspect that the victim could be Pradan and the two brothers might have eliminated him and hid the body parts in the wall of the house. "We are yet to trace the accused to find out the motive behind the murder. Until the accused are not nabbed, we will not know the reason for the gruesome murder,'' a source said. 
 
 After committing the murder, the two brothers locked the house and went absconding. 
 
 While mobile phones of both Vivek and Bhuvan were found switched off, police tracked Vivek's cell phone's last activity to a tower located near Secunderabad railway station. After that they fled to Bihar. The accused could be one of the roommates or both. It is learnt that police identified them based on CCTV footage at the station. The Cyberabad police have sent teams to Bihar and other states to track the duo.
