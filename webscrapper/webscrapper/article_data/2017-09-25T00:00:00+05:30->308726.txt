While   might have raised the bar about what to expect when he works on films, theatreperson Shashank Purushotham’s next, Mercury — which marks his debut in the Tamil film industry — is not letting him down. Not only is he excited because of the film is being made with some of the best technicians in the industry — it is directed by  , and National Award-winning cinematographer   is also on board — but the   is the antagonist in this silent thriller film, and apart from him, Shashank shares screen space with four other young actors, who are the protagonists, along with him — Sananth, Deepak Paramesh, Indu and Anish. And making the film, says the actor, was a personal experience for him. “I am the only actor from Bengaluru; everyone else is from Tamil Nadu. So, my Tamil isn’t very good. We rehearsed for 20-25 days for the movie before shooting began (which is a rarity) and over the period of time, all of us got along really well. I didn’t even know these guys before the rehearsals, but after those 25 days, we had become friends. The shoot schedule was hectic and we worked in double shifts. Apart from sleeping together, we did everything together,” says Shashank, laughing.
But it wasn’t just the friends that he made while shooting that made it a memorable experience. “The technical team is fantastic. The kind of energy that they bring to the set makes you want to give it your best. They want to create something special and different, and as an actor, you can’t just take your job for granted. When you see people slogging behind the camera, the least that you can do is give it your all,” Shashank says, signing off.
