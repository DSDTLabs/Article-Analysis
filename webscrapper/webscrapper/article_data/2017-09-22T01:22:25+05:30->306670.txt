Mumbai: With  , the first   of Islamic calendar which also features commemoration of the tragedy of Karbala, beginning today, the Muslims will mark the month, especially the initial 10 days, in  , processions, sermons and recitations of mournful poetry.

 For the Shias, commemoration of martyrdom of Imam Hussain, grandson of Prophet Muhammad at Karbala (Iraq) in 680, is an article of faith and they have planned a series of programmes leading to Ashura, 10th of Muharram, the day of Imam Hussain’s martyrdom. “Imam Hussain’s martyrdom was a turning point in the history of Islam and for humanity. The tragedy’s commemoration is important because it reminds us why peace and justice are important. It tells us that the outfits like Al-Qaida and ISIS are waging fake jihad in the name of Islam. They are the followers of Yazid (the king whose army killed Imam Hussain and his supporters at Karbala) and will ultimately be vanquished,” said Maulana Yasoob Abbas who will deliver Muharram sermons at Mughal Mosque or Masjid-e-Iranian at Dongri including other places in the city. 
 
 Even Sunnis will observe Muharram with sermons but in a slightly different way. “Sunni clerics will deliver sermons during the 10 days to underscore the importance of Imam Hussain’s sacrifice and the lessons it carries for us. He defied Yazid and suffered his brutalities to uphold the values the Prophet had set,” said Maulana Rizwan Khan, vice-president, Sunni Dawat-e-Islami, a worldwide movement of the Sunni Muslims.
