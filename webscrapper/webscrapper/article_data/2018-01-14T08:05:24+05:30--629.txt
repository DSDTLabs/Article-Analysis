The yatra will cover all the four constituencies in Lucknow districtwithleaders spending threeto four days in each constituency and meeting farmers,” said Gaurav Choudhary, district president of the party in Lucknow.
 
 
 Choudhary said the party will hold nukkad meetings and pad yatras across villages. Big meetings will be organized in Kakori, Bakshi Ka Talab, Sarojininagar and Mohanlalganj.

The meetings will culminate in a big chaupal at the end of yatra,” said party sources.
