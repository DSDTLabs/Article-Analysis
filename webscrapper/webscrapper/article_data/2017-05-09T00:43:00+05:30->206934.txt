Pimpri Chinchwad: The Pimpri Chinchwad New Township Development Authority (PCNTDA) demolished a school and 50 huts in a massive anti-encroachment drive in Wakad on Tuesday. Vasant Naik, deputy engineer, PCNTDA, said the school was razed since it was encroaching on PCNTDA land. It was a private English-medium school with a single-storey brick structure and a tin roof. “We had been pursuing the matter since 2002, but could not take the action due to the presence of students during the academic year. We issued notices to the owner continuously for the past two years. We waited till April 30 for the summer vacation to start before pulling down the structure,” Naik said. The drive was carried out amid police bandobast from the anti-encroachment squad and the Wakad police. Two excavators, one dumper, 10 labourers and about 20 staff members from the PCNTDA conducted the drive, Naik added. He said after the demolition of the school, 50 huts were also razed on an open plot near Kalewadi Phata on Sangvi-Kiwale bus rapid transit route.
