INDORE: Some unidentified men made away with smart phones worth Rs 30 lakh from a   container on   on December 7. A case in the matter was, however, registered on Tuesday after police learnt that the   smartphones were sold in the market and were being used by people. 

 A transport agency Om Logistics Limited regional manager Manohar Singh, a resident of Indorama in Pithampur, had approached Aerodrome police claiming that the consignment of   that he was getting transported from airport to Pithampur in a small container truck was stolen by some men. 
 
 He told police that he was transporting the smartphones for a customer and had hired a small container truck for the same. On December 7, when the truck driver was on his way from airport to Pithampur, a four-wheeler driver told the truck driver that the lock of his vehicle was broken. When he climbed down, he saw that the boxes containing the smartphones were missing. Following this, the driver contacted Singh, who approached Aerodrome police. 
 
 However, no case was registered in the matter until yesterday, when police received information that the phones were being used in Bhopal. The smart phones were being tracked by police.
 
 Police said that the accused might have stolen the boxes using the truck cutting method, which is prevalent in MP.
 
 Kanjars, a notorious tribe, are concentrated in Dewas district and operate along Shivpuri and Rajasthan borders in Shajapur, Ratlam, Mandsaur and Neemuch districts. They are a terror to truckers and highway users and are normally involved in loot. 
 
 “A case has been registered against unidentified persons and we are looking into the matter. The accused will be arrested at the earliest,” said Aerodrome police station in charge RD Kanva.
