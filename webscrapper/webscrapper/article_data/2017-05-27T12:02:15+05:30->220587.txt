JAIPUR: Rajasthan's approach in spreading awareness on Goods and Services Tax (GST) among traders and industry association has been recommended for other states too by the GST council.

 For the smooth transition to a new tax regime, central government and states have been pushing hard in reaching out to concerned stakeholders. Rajasthan, however, has adopted certain strategies that have helped in doing it better, claimed an official.
 
 “We mapped whole Rajasthan and our aim from beginning is to cover smallest part in the state. Two, what made the difference is that here senior officials are too going in the field, attending workshops with traders and addressing their queries“ said an official.
 
 The government is working overtime to roll out the goods and services tax regime from July 1.
 
 As part of outreach programmes, workshops are being held with industry bodies and trade associations. In the state out of 5.4 lakh traders about 4.41 lakhs have been successfully migrated to GST network.
 
 Earlier, state was also appreciated for preparing a model draft of SGST. According to the official, a sample draft was sent by the Centre and states were asked to make necessary changes keeping its soul intact.
