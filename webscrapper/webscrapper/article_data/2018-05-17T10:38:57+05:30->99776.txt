PUNE: The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Pune police on Wednesday arrested three persons, including two relatives of D S  , in a cheating case registered against the developer. 

 “All the three were associated with DSK group’s management when the alleged cheating took place and later left the group at different stages,” assistant commissioner of police   told TOI. One of the three was the chief operating officer (COO) in the group while the other two were part of the managerial staff, he added. 
 
 Police have already arrested DSK and his wife, Hemanti, for cheating depositors and the couple is lodged under judicial custody in Yerawada jail. 
 
 On Wednesday, a team led by deputy commissioner of police (economics & cyber) Sudhir Hiremath arrested   and two of Kulkarni’s relatives identified as Kedar Vanjape and Sai Vanjape. “Pachpor was the COO, while Kedar is the son-in-law of Kulkarni’s brother, Sai is Kedar’s wife,” Hiremath said.
 
 Hiremath said, “Pachpor looked after land deals. He, at first bought land in the names of Kulkarni’s relatives and then the land was transferred in the company’s name at much higher rates. In this way, the cost of the land was escalated and money was swindled. The two relatives of Kulkarni were part of this larger conspiracy. Thus, we have arrested them in the case.” “All the land transactions at Phursungi were carried out to cheat the people and to generate money for the family,” he added.
