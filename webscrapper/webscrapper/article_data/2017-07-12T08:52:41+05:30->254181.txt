Mumbai: Thane resident, Sandeep Bambugade (35), has been arrested for duping at least five people by selling his   to them at a cheaper rate. However, the police expect more victims to come forward after learning about his arrest. 

 The matter came to light after Chirag Sanghvi, a second-hand car dealer, came across an advertisement on social media that a second-hand SUV was for sale. The advertisement had a mobile number of one ‘Vijay Kumar Nelson’. Chirag contacted Nelson, who was Bambugade, and a deal was struck at Rs 12 lakh. Chirag gave him Rs 5.15 lakh as advance through cheque. “Later, Chirag tried contacting   several times but his phone was switched off,” said investigating officer Mohan Jagdale of Sion police. 
 
 Chirag lodged a complaint and police tracked Bambugade wife’s number through the call detail report (CDR) of his mobile phone. 
 
 The police questioned her and she revealed her husband’s whereabouts.
