NEW DELHI: Domestic flyers could from this year get more reliable data on airlines’ punctuality, helping them make better choices based on the parameter of on-time performance (OTP). 

 The Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( ) at present gets OTP of domestic flights from four airports — Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad — every month for punctuality ranking. 
 
 Now, it is planning to expand the number of airports from where this information will be collected to give more reliable OTP data of airlines. 
 
 “We are planning to add at least five airports in the list of OTP collection for giving out airline punctuality data. Places like Kolkata, Chennai and Kochi need to be added to the four from where this data is currently taken. We are examining this issue of data collection very closely as we need to be sure that the same is accurate. Punctuality record of airlines is an important factor in a passenger choosing one airline over another and therefore this information has to be completely authentic,” said a DGCA official. 
 
 Over a year ago, airlines were locked in a bitter fight on the issue of domestic OTP. IndiGo had accused the Mumbai airport of giving data that favoured competing airlines.
