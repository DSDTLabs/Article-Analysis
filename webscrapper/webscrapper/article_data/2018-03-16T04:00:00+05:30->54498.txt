Rajkot: A blind man was one of the two accused arrested on Wednesday night in the rape case of an 12-year-old girl who is now seven months pregnant. 

 Police identified the blind accused as Vijanand Mayad (47), a resident of Babaria Colony in Rajkot and his accomplice, a 17-year-old minor boy, who has been sent to remand home. 
 
 Apart from the duo, police investigation also found the involvement of two more accused identified as Govind and Vipul whom police are hunting. 
 
 Earlier, Nanji Javiya (67) and his neighbour Arwind Kubawat (60), both residents of Babaria Colony, were arrested for the crime on Tuesday. 
 
 The survivor used to work as a maid at Javiya’s house. First Javiya and Arwind raped her and then Javiya invited Mayad, the minor boy Govind and Vipul to commit the crime. 
 
 The minor, who became pregnant after being raped several times, has been admitted in a critical condition. The doctors believe that the survivor will deliver a child in three to four weeks. 
 
 “We will be taking the blood sample from the foetus to match it with DNA samples of the accused to ascertain the fatherhood of the child,” said Mahila police station inspector P B Shapara.
