TRICHY: The election to select the 11 board of directors to the primary agriculture cooperative credit society (PACCS) in   in Perambalur was mirrored by violence, leading to the postponement of the election on Monday. 

 Sources said that the election seemed favourable to the DMK candidates, who had an edge over the   and others. While the election process was underway, a group of men entered the polling booth of the society and vandalised the tables, chairs and polling materials. It is also alleged that they tore the ballot papers and burnt them. The miscreants were later identified as members of the ruling AIADMK.
 
 DMK men led by its district secretary   blocked the Perambalur- Aathur Road to protets against the vandalism. A police team led by deputy superintendent of police Gnana Sivakumar and cooperative officials rushed to the spot and conducted talks with the protesters. The officials pacified them by ordering the postponement of the election.
 
 The situation was same in Poolambadi, Venganur and Kaarai with the AIADMK men disrupting the election process in three places and officials announcing postponement.
 
 Tension prevailed in Pudukkottai as police arrested around 50 DMK cadres who came to petition the regional joint director of cooperative societies demanding to conduct the election in a fair and free manner. Since regional joint director Mrunalini was unavailable at the office to receive the petition, they waited there. But police tried to remove them by force, leading to scuffle and arrests.
