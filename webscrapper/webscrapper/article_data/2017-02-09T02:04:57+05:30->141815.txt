NEW DELHI:   on Wednesday approached   seeking relief from the duty of catching and   from their areas to   saying it is unable to find trained monkey catchers.

 In an application, SDMC said the task must be carried out by government’s wildlife department which is the appropriate body.
 
 The plea filed before a bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal sought modification of the high court’s March 14, 2007 direction to the municipality to catch monkeys and relocate them to the sanctuary.
 
 Arguing that under the Wildlife Protection Act, the government’s wildlife department is the appropriate body to carry out the HC direction, the corporation said it neither has the power nor the resources to catch and relocate the animal.
 
 It also apprised the court about efforts made in this regard, citing several advertisements for recruiting monkey catchers issued in newspapers. It added that despite hiking the amount to be paid to monkey catchers to Rs 1,200, there was no applications, leaving it facing the ire of local residents who complained about the simian menace.
 
 It said that it had also written to the chief wildlife warden of the Delhi government and also to Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan, to provide monkey catchers, but got no response. Even cages were not provided by the government, the corporation alleged.
 
 Meanwhile, the “menace” is increasing and even those simians which were relocated to Asola-Bhati have moved into nearby residential areas and schools and are allegedly attacking children, SDMC said. The high court’s direction to the municipal corporation had come on a petition filed by the residents of   for catching and relocating monkeys.
