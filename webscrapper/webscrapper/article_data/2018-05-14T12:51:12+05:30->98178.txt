PANAJI: Vasco boy Sahas Shailesh Kamat of Dempo Higher Secondary School of Science (PACE), with a score of 204 in PCM (physics, chemistry, mathematics), emerged as the top candidate for an engineering seat in Goa. The Goa Common Entrance Test (GCET) results were declared on Monday morning.

 Chandor resident Ravindra Abhay Kudchadkar, of Mushtifund Aryaan Higher Secondary School, scored 195 and has the second best score at GCET among engineering seat aspirants in Goa.
 
 This year, GCET was answered by 4,169 candidates across Goa. Of these, roughly 35 percent will land an engineering seat, officials said. GCET is held for entry to engineering and pharmacy degree course seats in Goa. Goa has 1,230 engineering seats on offer across five institutes.
 
 Both Sahas and Ravindra have qualified in the IITJEE-MAIN and said they will decide on the institute they will join based on the IITJEE-Advance results.
 
 Sahas has topped physics scoring 68 out of 75 at GCET, Ravindra had the best score in chemistry of 70 out of 75 and Arsh Mahesh Korgaonkar scored 71 in mathematics.
 
 The lowest score this year in physics dropped at GCET to zero, which led academics to raise concern over the quality of physics education in Goa's schools.
 
 All 4,169 that registered for GCET this year answered both physics and chemistry papers, while mathematics was answered by 3,235 students.
