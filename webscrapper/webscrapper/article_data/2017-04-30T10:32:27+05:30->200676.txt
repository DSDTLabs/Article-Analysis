HYDERABAD: A day after a   without a valid visa was nabbed by the   (NCB) at the   railway station, for carrying 200 gm of cocaine, it is learnt that over 200 foreign nationals, including 40 Nigerians, are overstaying in  . 

 According to the Foreign Regional Registration Office (FRRO), these over 200 foreigners came to the city on long-term visa (for either study or work) and have chosen to stay back in the city despite their visas expiring. Even worse, they did not choose to renew their travel documents and began indulging in criminal activities to make their ends meet. In the last one year, the FRRO officials have managed to deport just four African nationals for their alleged involvement in peddling drugs in the city. 
 
 According to Foreign Regional Registration Officer  : "Many of these foreigners do not stay put in one place. When they enter the country, they are supposed to register with our office and provide the address where they would be staying in the city."As per police protocol, once the accused gets punishment after trial, they would be deported automatically. "However, since it is a legal issue, we cannot deport them immediately and wait till the trial concludes. Till then, they continue to stay here," he said. Even worse, the foreign nationals shift their place of residence without informing the FRRO. "The rules stipulate that these people are supposed to register with our office and inform us about their place of residence and update the address if they shift," he added.
 
 However, it is not the foreigners alone who are to be blamed. Even house owners have a duty to inform the FRRO, if the foreign tenant shifts. "Over 80% property owners do not know this rule, so we are never informed about their movements. If we are told about their movement, we can ask police to tail them and prevent them from getting into anti-social activities," Reddy said.
