 Lacquer thinner, commonly used for removing household paints, is known to contain a mixture of various aromatic hydrocarbons. If ingested, it may cause methemoglobinemia — a blood disorder in which too little oxygen is delivered to body’s cells. “The child was from Agra. After the poisoning, he was first taken to a local hospital with complaints of drowsiness, bluish discoloration, and faster breathing for six hours. He came to SGRH on mechanical ventilation. Medicines and blood transfusion alone couldn’t reduce the toxicity,” the doctors said.
 
 The doctors have published the successful use of fat to clear the child’s body of poison in the Journal of Clinical Toxicology.
