  A secret agent (Taapsee Pannu) seeks revenge for the murder of the man she loved. Shabana Khan is the special agent who is entrusted the task of assassinating a deadly arms dealer(Prithviraj) by the Indian Intelligence Agencies.
 
 
  The first half indulges the protagonist and her love interest, Jai too much. It is only post-intermission, especially the last 35 minutes in which proceedings pick up. Sticking to a typical-action drama narrative that jumps from Mumbai to Goa, Vienna to Kuala Lumpur, with the arms dealer and the ISI agents playing a cat-and-mouse game, the film, is more an escapist fare than a realistic one.

  Taapsee Pannu-starrer 'Naam Shabana', which hit theatres on Friday (March 31), collected approximately Rs 4.75 crore (nett) on its opening day, according to a report on Boxofficeindia.com. Watch this sapce for more updates.
