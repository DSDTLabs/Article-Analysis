NEW DELHI: If 65-year-old Shiv Shankar Mehto’s son, Kamleshwar, had not helped one of the teenagers trapped under the   that rammed his father’s autorickshaw and killed him, even the youngster could have died in the accident.

 Kamleshwar (35), who had reached the spot minutes after the accident, said that he found the teenager stuck under the wheels of the killer vehicle with a severe cut on his head. He and passersby lifted the car and pulled him out.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Mehto’s family is yet to come to terms with their loss. They said that he used to ferry passengers at night, while his son plied an autorickshaw during the day. He migrated to Delhi with his family from their village in Bettiah district of Bihar 20 years ago and drove autorickshaws on rent. His wife died a few years after coming to Delhi. They were staying in a DDA flat near   on rent.
 
 “My father was always at the forefront in helping others. In fact, he preferred to drive at night around Lady Hardinge and RML hospitals as a lot of people needed help during the late hours. We decided to help the people who killed my father since he would have done the same if someone else was involved,” Kamleshwar said.
 
 Kish Mohan, Mehto’s nephew, said, “Even while being pulled out from the wreckage, the teenagers were more concerned about their car than the person they had killed. None of them even asked us whether the person they had   was alive or dead.”
 
 The victim also used to send money to his family members who stay in Bettiah. They had sold off their small plot of land there to pay off debts.
 
 “On Wednesday, Shiv Shankar had sought leave from me to go to his hometown and meet his daughter. I have not only lost my new vehicle but also a good friend,” said Arjun Kumar, the owner of the autorickshaw that Mehto was driving.
 
 The family is going to cremate Mehto’s body in Delhi as they don’t have the means to take it back to his hometown.
