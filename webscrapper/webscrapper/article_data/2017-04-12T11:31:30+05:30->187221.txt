AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court has denied bail to Mohammed Ishrad  , who is accused of throwing acid on his wife at the   last month.

 Additional sessions judge   refused bail to Shaikh on the grounds that he may influence witnesses and tamper with evidence, if released from jail. The court also took into consideration the apprehension expressed by Shaikhâ€™s wife, that he may attack her again. The possibility of the accused escaping trial also weighed with the court in denying bail, because he was arrested much after his wife lodged the complaint against him, said public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt.
