HYDERABAD: Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sleuths have registered a cheating case against three State   (SBH) officials, who earlier worked in Chittoor, for resorting to fraudulent exchange of Rs 64 lakh demonetised cash.

 On February 23, N Ramalingaswamy, deputy general manager of the SBH, Tirupati Zone, lodged a complaint with the CBI’s Hyderabad office stating that E Muniraja, the then branch manager of SBH, Chittoor Branch, V Sri Ramulu, the then head cashier, and  , the then assistant manager (accounts), had resorted to fraudulent exchange of Rs 64 lakh demonetised currency between November 9 and December 31, 2016.
 
 The complainant alleged the three used several methods to exchange demonetised currency for clients in a fraudulent manner. “The accused officials had exchanged Rs 24 lakh demonetised currency for a client,” a CBI official said.
 
 The bank officials identified the fraud during an internal vigilance audit. After identifying the accused and gathering evidence, they approached the CBI.
 
 During preliminary investigation, the CBI sleuths had discovered that the culprits exchanged amounts in excess of Rs 4,000 per day to their clients for commission in violation of   (RBI) rules.
 
 The bank officials also told CBI officials that the accused had issued demand drafts (DD) worth Rs 2.6 lakh to certain clients by taking demonetised currency. “When the daily cash issue limit was Rs 2,000 per client, the accused bank manager and his associates took demonetised currency deposits from the clients and issued part of the deposit amount back to them in the form of new currency for commission,” the SBH officials told CBI.
 
 The CBI sleuths have registered a case against the trio under sections 120 B r/w 420, 409, 477-A of the IPC and sections 13 (2) r/w 13 (1) (c) & (d) of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act on February 28. No arrests have been made yet.
