 in the state have urged the Centre to pay Rs 150 crore compensation for the losses they suffered due to rejection of grape consignments by European countries in 2009-10 over presence of pesticide.

 In 2009-10, European countries had rejected grape consignments which had chlormequat chloride component, a plant growth regulator, in excess of the prescribed maximum residue level.This resulted in losses of total Rs 150 crore to 85 farmers.
 
 After joint efforts by the government and exporters, European countries, except Germany , had accepted some consignments at lower rates.The rest had been diverted to countries such as Russia, Dubai, Singapore and Malaysia.
 
 Kailsas Bhosle, chairman of the science committee of Maharashtra Rajya Draksha Bagayatdar Sangh, an association of grape producers, said, “We recently met Union minister for road transport, highways and shipping Nitin Gadkari and Union minister for commerce and industry Nirmala Sitharaman over compensation for grape growers. The losses happened due to the negligence of the government as it did not inform farmers about the presence of residue.“
 
 Bhosle said the ministers promised compensation. “A committee has been appointed on this,“ Bhosle added.
