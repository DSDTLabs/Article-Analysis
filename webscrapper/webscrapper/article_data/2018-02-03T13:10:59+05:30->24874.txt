PANAJI:The state directorate of fisheries is looking to adopt Udipi’s successful model of house-to-house cage fish farming. 

 Initially, about 100 4m/4m sized cages will be set up that locals can install in their yards and begin fish culture.
 
 While the practice of raising selected fish in enclosures at open seas has been going on for the past few years at Polem and by way of reservoir culture at Chapoli dam, the new model will look at involving people other than   to   for self-consumption and even sale if there is excess production.
 
 “With this, there will be less dependency on the market and people can go for local species. The technical and financial assistance will be provided by the department,” said fisheries secretary  .   Fisheries Development Board (NFDB) has agreed to provide help in this regard, he said.
 
 “Local species of fresh water fish will be more feasible for this experiment. Seeds and feed for the same will procured from NFDB and Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. Every block in Goa will be provided with the opportunity,” he said.
