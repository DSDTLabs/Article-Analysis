Chennai: The automotive industry which has clocked a 6% growth in industrial capex in the FY12-17 period, is estimated to clock another 5% growth in the FY17-21.  Already, top vehicle makers and component manufacturers are lining up significant capex for the transition to BS6 in 2020 and on product development thereafter.  Hero Motocorp for example has announced Rs 2,500 crore investment over two years including Rs 800 crore in its new plant at Sri City Andhra Pradesh. M&M has already announced Rs 4,000 crore investment per year for 3 years including Rs 2,500 crore for capex and another Rs 1,500 crore for investment. As for Tata Motors, late last year its CEO announced a Rs 4,000 crore capex including Rs 2,500 crore for passenger vehicles and Rs 1,500 crore for the truck and bus business. Passenger vehicle market leader Maruti Suzuki will also pump in Rs 4,000 crore each year — in FY17 as well as the soon to start financial year — mostly on product development R&D and network expansion. Motown’s capex growth has been slower in the past 6 years compared to before. The sector totted up 35% capex growth in the FY2004-2012 period said a recent report by equity research firm Motilal Oswal and auto capex continues to be among the top 5 sectors since 2004.  In the FY2004-12 period it came after infrastructure (61%) capital goods and TMT (50%) cement (46%) and metals (38%).  In the FY12-17 period auto came after pharma (24%) TMT (21%) oil & gas (19%) and capital goods (8%).  In the FY17-21 period auto is expected to come after cement (9%) oil and gas (8%) and metals (7%). Top component majors too have lined up investments either for the BS6 migration or global orders or for the longer term electric mobility business. Motherson Sumi for example has lined up around Rs 2,000-Rs 1,800 crore of capex this year. MNC tier 1 component maker Bosch has been pumping in Rs 650- 800 crore annually and will continue to do so going forward.
