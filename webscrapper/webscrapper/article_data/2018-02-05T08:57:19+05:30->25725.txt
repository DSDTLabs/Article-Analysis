PUNE: The Pune rural police on Saturday arrested a sandalwood   and recovered 52kg of stolen   and a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV), collectively worth Rs 8.64 lakh.

 The suspect, 45-year-old Ramesh Karde, of Dapodi village in Daund, was nabbed near the   toll post on the Pune-Solapur highway. The team, led by inspector Dayanand Gawade, made the arrest.
 
 “Police constable   received a tip-off that one person, carrying stolen sandalwood in an SUV, would be going towards Kedgaon and Chaufula,” Gawade said.
 
 On spotting a white SUV, the police blocked the road near the toll post at Kedgaon. “When the driver noticed the obstacles, he stopped the vehicle and tried to run away. Our team gave him a chase and nabbed him,” Gawade said.
 
 When the policemen checked the SUV, they found the sandalwood, weighing about 52 kg, kept in two bags. “We have seized the sandalwood and the SUV,” Gawade said.
 
 During interrogation, Karde admitted that the sandalwood was stolen from the different parts of the district. He was planning to sell the sandalwood in Solapur. “Karde was involved in smuggling of sandalwood to Ahmednagar and   from Pune. He also has cases registered against him with the Pune city police,” Gawade added.
 
 An officer from Pune Rural police said the suspect may have been operating a gang of sandalwood thieves, who are involved cutting and stealing sandalwood trees from Pune city and district.
