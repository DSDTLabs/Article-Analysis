Four months after their fairytale wedding,   and   are all set to star together in director Shiva Nirvana’s next.   announced the news with a post on his microblog that read: “Happy to announce my next directed by Shiva and will be sharing screen space (if she gives me any ;-) ) with my better half @Samanthaprabhu2...”
 
 The actor went on to add, “Feels good to be back to being able to take you through another journey of love.”   caught up with director Shiva to find out more about the film. “It’s an intense love story and I wrote the script keeping Chai and Sam in mind. In fact, before I began narrating the script, I told Chaitanya, “Samantha heroine character chesthe next level ki veluthundi movie. (If Sam plays the female lead, the movie will go to the next level). Chaitanya loved the script and so did Sam,” reveals Shiva, who shot into limelight with his debut film, the Nani-Nivedha Thomas-starrer Ninnu Kori. 
 
 Ask him if Chai and Sam will be playing a married couple in the movie, and Shiva says, “I’m afraid you will have to watch the movie to find that out. But I can assure you that the audience will be able to completely identify with the characters Sam and Chai play. They are a very adorable couple in real life too and the audience will get to see the same onscreen as well. The pre-production work is still on; we will start shooting for the film after Naga Chaitanya completes shooting for Savyasachi.”
