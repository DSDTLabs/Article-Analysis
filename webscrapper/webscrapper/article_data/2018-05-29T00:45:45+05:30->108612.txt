NEW DELHI:   administration is worried about “fake news” on certain   about the university’s  . Since the start of the Open Day sessions in the campus from May 21, DU has received multiple queries from students asking about the dates for entrance tests for BCom (honours) and BA (honours) economics despite the information bulletin and the official FAQs pointing out that admissions in these subjects are only merit-based.

 In December last year, DU had received several queries from students when it was being circulated on social media that DU is planning to conduct entrance tests for its BCom course. Quoting the convener of the admission committee of the 2017 admissions, the websites had claimed that the plans are in place for entrance tests in collaboration with the CBSE.
 
 However, this was denied by DU which reiterated that no such entrance test is in the works but the “news” is still circulating.
 
 According to  , deputy dean of students welfare (DSW), the problem is persistent. “On an average, we get around six or seven queries about entrance tests. And we always tell them that this information is false,” the official told TOI. He added that aspirants have also been inquiring about the Common Aptitude Test for English (CATE) at DU.
