Actress   spent a couple of days shooting in Delhi and Noida for an upcoming episode of 'Savdhaan India'. Shruti said, “I’m from Dehradun, but I used to visit Delhi quite often, and would hear of Noida as a small place at the border of Delhi. Now that I come here for work, I realise that it is actually a well-planned city, and is known for its malls and the DND Flyway. For a long time, I didn’t know what the full form of DND was until I asked a few relatives staying here. While shooting in Noida, I was staying at a hotel in Sector 18 and crossed the two big malls in the neighbourhood, but unfortunately didn’t get a chance to shop.”

  The actress shot for the episode that is based on a true crime story in Delhi. The team shot at   in Delhi and at   in Noida. “I play the role of defense lawyer in the story, which is about how a woman wrongly accused a man of rape. This episode has been written keeping in mind the increasing cases where women misuse laws to blackmail, extort money, and sometimes just to take revenge after a break-up. As per the research and data that we collected for this show, around 53.6% cases of rapes registered in the country are false charges, and many of these cases are from Delhi-NCR, so we decided to shoot the episode at different places in Delhi-NCR,” added Shruti.
