MUMBAI: With crimes against women and children spurting online, the state women's commission set up a committee on Tuesday to prepare a draft suggesting ways to curb such crimes, changes needed in law to speed up prosecution, and counselling of victims. 

 "The draft will be submitted to the state government in the next three months recommending changes in legal framework to tackle cybercrime. The cyber committee has been set up to suggest ways to curb harassment of women on social media by trolls or through objectionable online posts,"   member secretary Dr   told TOI. 
 
 Headed by special IG of cybercrime cell Brijesh Singh, the panel includes Vinita Ved, secretary of women and child welfare department, DCP Rashmi Karandikar, advocate  , and other social workers, journalists and cops. 
 
 "Our (the police personnel's) role will be to provide examples of cases and legal guidelines to the committee so that it can decide on the course of action," said Singh.
 
 The commission decided to set up the panel after taking cognizance of the rising cases of harassment of women on social media (see box). "The commission has considered the fact that some miscreants put up objectionable posts or some even troll women on social media outlets. This is a case of virtual rape of the victims and the issue should be dealt with seriously and speedily. The committee's first objective is to publish booklet on remedies for cybercrime victims," said cyber advocate Prashant Mali, who is also a part of the committee.
 
 Commission chief Vijaya Rahatkar said   takes a toll on the mental and physical health of women. "We felt the need to bring in some guidelines or norms so that online trollers and miscreants are deterred by the law. This committee has been constituted to study the issue and come up with recommendations as soon as possible," she said.
