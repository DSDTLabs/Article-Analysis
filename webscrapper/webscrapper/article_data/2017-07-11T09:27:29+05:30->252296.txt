NEW DELHI: At the end of the third cutoff admissions, most courses in North Campus colleges have either closed or have very few seats left. DU officials said the   list is going to see a   drop of 0.25% to 1% points from the previous list. 

 Some courses are expected to reopen in the fourth list after   in the third list. For example, Lady Shri Ram is planning to reopen its philosophy and history courses. Some seats are available in journalism, English and psychology as well, said officials. But the dip is likely to be “conservative” — around 0.25 percentage points. In Dayal Singh (Morning), admissions to several key courses — physics, chemistry, maths, chemistry and commerce — under the general category have closed. For the rest, officials said, the dip will be around 0.5% points. At Kamla Nehru, Sri Aurobindo and Hindu, most seats are taken. 
 
 At South Campus, Motilal Nehru, Ram Lal Anand, Aryabhatta and Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma colleges saw a high turnout in the third cuoff. But many students said they would like to shift to other colleges.
 
  “I am still hoping for a seat in a North Campus college for English. I took admission to be on the safe side,” said  , who took admission in English at Ram Lal Anand. 
 
 For many others, however, the process is over. Priya Malhotra, with a score of 96%, chose Jesus & Mary over IP College where she had got admitted in the second list. “It is near home and I preferred it.” 
 
 Many OBC students were turned away as all details were not mentioned in their caste certificate. Ranjan Krishna Yadav’s certificate doesn’t specify the OBC category, ‘Yadav’. So, he was told to come back after making necessary changes. “As it takes months to change details, I am trying to submit an undertaking for the time being. But I am told that it is not acceptable,” said  , who came to seek admission in mathematics at Sri Venkateswara College.
