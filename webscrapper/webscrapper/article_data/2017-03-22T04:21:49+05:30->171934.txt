A top government official today said the law will take its own course in cases of attacks on the media and film fraternity by fringe elements. 

 "I can assure you that our Constitution and the various institutions created by it are strong enough to take on the challenges presented by fringe groups in their attacks on media or on creativity. Please have faith,"   secretary   said.
 
 Addressing the concerns of the film industry against incidents of vandalism, he said the fringe elements will be dealt with as per laws of the land. 
 
 
  
 "We have the fringes (but) we also have the rule of law. And we also have these strong institutions to ensure that the rule of law prevails," Mittal said.
 
 Last week, around 20 unidentified people had torched the sets of   director  's period drama 'Padmavati' at  , alleging historical misrepresentation.
