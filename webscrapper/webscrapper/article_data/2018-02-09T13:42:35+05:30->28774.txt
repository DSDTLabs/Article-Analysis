MADURAI: After five years, the city   managed to replace a damaged sewer line on F F Road in ward 39 which had been letting waste water into the nearby Sellur Odai.

 Work on replacing the pipeline started two weeks ago. Madurai Corporation had to dig a 20-foot-deep trench in order to replace a piece of the pipe, measuring at least 15 feet in length, that had ruptured due to gas buildup within the chamber. "Sewer water was leaking swiftly from the ruptured portion. We had to replace the pipe without affecting traffic flow too," said Pandi, one of the workers at the site. The work has, however, shrunk the width of   station road. "We had to widen the size of the trench because motorists would try to nudge their way onto F F Road through a narrow gap between the work site and a building's compound wall nearby,"   added. When TOI visited the site, the corporation's ward engineer was not present to monitor the work.
 
 The workers added that it would take another ten days to close the trench. Barely 10 feet away from the work site, a gas buildup had led to an explosion under the road surface. No safety precautions have been undertaken at the location.TNN
