AURANGABAD: Chief minister   on Sunday said efforts were on to bring in 50 tmc (thousand million cubic) ft water for Marathwada from the Damanganga river and the Pinjal reservoir.

 “The state government has charted out a pilot project to end the water woes of Marathwada. We are trying to divert around 50 tmc water from Damanganga-Pinjal to the basin of the Godavari river. The state government has accorded in-principle approval for the initiative and the detailed scheme would be forwarded to the Centre for necessary approval and support,” Fadnavis said while addressing the Marathwada Liberation Day celebrations. The National Water Development Agency (NWDA), a central body that runs under the aegis of the ministry of water resources, has already proposed the Damanganga-Pinjal link. It proposes to divert surplus waters available at Bhugad and Khargihill reservoirs in the Damanganga basin to the Pinjal dam across the river Pinjal in the Vaitarna basin. It will send 909 million cubic metres of water to Mumbai for meeting domestic and industrial demands.
 
 While the NWDA proposal related to the Damanganga-Pinjal link has so far been silent on diverting water to the Godavari basin, the latest announcement made by CM is believed to be an indication of a further modification in the project charted out in the light of the interlinking of rivers.
