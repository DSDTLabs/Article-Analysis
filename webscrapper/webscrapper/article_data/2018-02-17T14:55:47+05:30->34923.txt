AMARAVATI: Seven workers suffocated to death on Friday after they were asked to clean a waste tank at Venkateswara Hatcheries in Moram village of Palamaner mandal in Andhra Pradeshâ€™s Chittoor district. The workers did not have any safety equipment while they entered the tank.

 The deceased were identified as M Ramesh (32), G Govinda Swamy (35), B Ramachandra (23), A Reddappa (30), R Babu (30), Kesava (20) from Ayyam Reddy Palle, and B Venkata Rajulu (23). Another worker, Sivakumar Reddy (43), managed to escape with the help of locals who rushed to his rescue.
 
 
  
  
 
 The incident happened around 9.30am when the workers were asked to check the blocked waste tank. According to Palamaneru deputy superintendent of police, K Chowdeswari, Reddappa entered the drain first from a manhole. As he did not respond for sometime after entering the drain, three others entered the tank. When they too faced difficulty in breathing, they started shouting for help. Following this, three other workers entered the drain to save them, but succumbed to the toxic gases. Sivakumar Reddy was the lone survivor.
 
  
  
 
 The workers were rushed to Palamaneru government hospital where doctors declared six of them brought dead. The seventh worker died during treatment. Siva Kumar Reddy was shifted to Veluru in Tamil Nadu.
 
 District fire officer V Srinivas Reddy said the hatchery did not have an NOC from the fire department. Police have booked a case under Section 304A of IPC (death due to negligence) and are investigating. The state government has announced Rs 10 lakh compensation to the family of each deceased while the company has agreed to pay Rs 15 lakh ex gratia.
