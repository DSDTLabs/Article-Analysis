TRICHY: Sleuths of vigilance and anti-corruption wing arrested the district environmental engineer (DEE) of   pollution control board (TNPCB),  , for accepting bribe from a man for renewing the licence of a stone crusher unit here on Thursday.

 The police caught DEE A Rengasamy 57, red-handed near his house at Thiruvanaikaval while receiving the chemical-laced currency of Rs 50,000 from the complainant, B Muralitharan, the owner of a blue metal crusher unit at Poolacheri in Musiri.
 
 Prior to that, Muralitharan had lodged a complaint with the V&AC police in Trichy frustrated by the demand of Rs 1.5 lakh by Rengasamy for moving the files for renewing the licence of his crusher unit for 2018. Sources said that Muralitharan had applied for licence renewal at the TNPCB office at Thuvakudi earlier. Since there was no action on the application, he applied at the head office in Chennai but they forwarded the application to DEE who in turn demanded a bribe. The police laid a trap and asked the complainant to hand over the cash to him. Rengasamy had asked Muralidharan to bring the cash to a ground near his house around 8 am on Thursday.
 
 Searches at his office and his house in Thiruvanaikaval led to the seizure of Rs 4.5 lakh in cash and documents for deposits of Rs 27,54,974. A case was registered under section 7 and 13 (2) read with 13 (1) of Tamil Nadu Prevention of Corruption Act. He was produced in court and remanded in   at the central prison. It was the second high-profile arrest on the charge of corruption in recent weeks.
