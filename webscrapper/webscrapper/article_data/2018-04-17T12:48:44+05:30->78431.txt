A Bengali drama inspired by the theme of euthanasia is ready to hit the screens this summer after getting approval from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). If all goes according to plan, Indrasis Acharya’s ‘Pupa’ will release on June 1.

  
 The movie is touted to be the first on the subject of euthanasia following the Supreme Court’s recent recognition of a 'living will' made by terminally-ill patients for passive euthanasia. ‘Pupa’ revolves around an expatriate Bengali Subhro living the US whose father has slipped into a coma and how he is facing a predicament whether or not to stay back in India.
 
 
  
 
 Director   (Rajat, uncle of Subhro),   (Mou, elder sister of Subhro), Rahul Banerjee (Subhro),   (Sidhu) will be seen in key roles in the movie. The music has been scored by Joy Sarkar.
 
 As per the narrative, Subhro returns India when his mother dies. When he is again ready to head back to the US, his father suffers a cerebral attack. Subhro’s uncle advices him to leave behind the emotion and go back to the US. His fianceé who is starting her integrated PhD in the US is left with no other choice but to leave him and go ahead. In this turmoil, a shocking incident leads to the climax of the story.
