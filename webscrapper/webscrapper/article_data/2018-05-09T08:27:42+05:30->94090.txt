 Goa Dairy is a federation of about 165-village-level-milk-collection-societies which elect 12 representatives as directors on the board of Goa State Cooperative Milk Producersâ€™ Union popularly known as Goa Dairy and one among them is elected as chairman of the dairy.
 
 While the board makes policy decisions, the managing director looks after administration. The allegations of the scams leveled by the former chairman Sahakari against the managing director has backfired against Sahakari, resulting in his ousting from the post.
 
 A no-confidence motion, moved against Sahakari, was passed by 8-3 votes after he issued a suspension order against managing director N Sawant. The order was stalled by eight directors claiming that such decisions must be taken at the board meeting and not by the chairman alone.
