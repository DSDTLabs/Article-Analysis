NEW DELHI: AAP chief  , who has in the past called Prime Minister   “dictatorial”, tweeted today that India “needs to be protected from Hitler-like forces.”

 “I wish all my fellow citizens on Republic Day. This republic needs to be protected from Hitler-like forces,” Kejriwal tweeted today on the occasion of the country’s Republic Day.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Although the Delhi chief minister didn’t name these “Hitler-like forces”, one could presume he was either referring to the PM or to US President  , who has in five days taken a slew of decisions that his critics have termed “unilateral” and “dictatorial”.
 
 Still, given Kejriwal has no love lost for PM Modi, he might have been hinting at someone closer to home.
 
 In another tweet today, the Delhi chief minister alleged that Modi ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation ( ) to go to his party’s offices on the eve of Republic Day to seize documents related to his government’s ‘Feedback Unit’.
 
 
  
  
 
 Earlier this month, the CBI registered a preliminary enquiry to look into the setting up of the Unit. The unit was allegedly created to "gather relevant information and actionable feedback" about officials and departments under the Delhi government. 
 
 Last year, Kejriwal accused the PM of authoritarian tendencies after the latter, in a shock move on November 8, scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. The Delhi CM also accused Modi of “working against the constitution” after there were crises in the Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh assemblies.
 
 “Modi ji doesn’t have faith either in the Constitution or on democracy. He is ruling in a dictatorial way. He is toppling the opposition governments and working against the Constitution. The Modi Government has got a tight slap twice on its face…first in Uttarakhand and now in Arunachal Pradesh,” Kejriwal told reporters last year. He was referring to a Supreme Court decision on Arunachal Pradesh that was unfavourable to Modi’s BJP.
