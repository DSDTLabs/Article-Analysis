The district schools include the Sector 9, Darbaripur,   and Farrukhnagar government primary schools. The move will benefit parents who want their kids to study in   schools.

 Bimla, head teacher, Sector 9 Government  , said that the school would switch the medium of study from Hindi to English for a selected batch of Class I students this session. Bimla said, “This is an experiment being done by the education department. We have 26 teachers in the school. The school has selected one teacher to attend a workshop to be held in   on how to impart education to students in English medium.”
 
 Anita Yadav, Class I teacher who has been selected for the workshop, said, “There are nearly 550 students in the school and over 100 students in the four sections of Class I. The school has taken a decision to turn the medium of study to English for a batch of 30 Class I students, this year.” 
 
 The 30 students will be selected based on their performance in English. “However, some parents might not want their kids to study in English. On April 28, we will hold a PTM to ask parents whether they want to send their kids to this class or not,” said Yadav. More than 80% of the students in the school come from nearby slums. “It’s not easy to make the whole school English medium overnight. Even if we teach students in English, they will be using Hindi to study at home,” said Yadav.
