  In his first appearance at the quadrennial games, the 18-year-old from the village of Shadipur in Haryana - who was once enrolled at Pune’s Army Sports Institute as a diver - finished with a combined effort of 295kg (136 in snatch and 159 in clean & jerk). 
 
 While Sanjita and Lather secured medals, the only blip in weightlifting for India came through Saraswati Rout, who was eliminated from the women's 58kg-event after failing in all her three 78kg Snatch attempts.
 
 The other good news for India came in the form of young boxer Naman Tanwar, who defeated Tanzania’s Haruna Mhandoby a unanimous verdict (30-26, 30-25, 30-26, 30-24, 30-24) to progress into the men’s 91kg quarter-finals. His compatriot Amit Phangal too booked a place in the quarterfinals of the 49kg event win a dominating win over Ghana's Tetteh Sulemanu, again by a unanimous verdict (30-26, 30-26, 30-27, 30-27 and 30-25). 
 
 In other good news, the Indian women’s hockey team beat Malaysia 4-1 to register their first win of the competition, bouncing back from a shock defeat to Wales on Day 1. Gurjit Kaur was the scorer of the first two goals, the first one early on via a fine drag-flick and the second in the third quarter, not long after Malaysia had equalised. Goals to captain Rani Rampal and Lalremsiami in the final minutes completed a 4-1 win at the   Hockey Centre.

Malhotra, who on day one won both his matches while the more fancied third seeded Saurav Ghoshal and Harinder Pal Sindhu were eliminated, lost the first, third and fourth games to exit the competition.
