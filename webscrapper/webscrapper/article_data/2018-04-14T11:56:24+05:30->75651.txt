JAIPUR: The   on Friday dismissed the   plea of rape accused Falahari baba. This is the second bail application of baba.

 The single bench of Justice   dismissed the bail plea after it was strongly opposed by the victimâ€™s counsel Madhav Mitra. 
 
 Mitra argued that there is no reason to believe that the victim as the accused was a godman for the family. Besides he argued that delay in filing the FIR in no way dilute the charge against the godman.
 
 The high court in the case of Asaram Bapu had ruled that the charges of rape against godmen should be treated seriously because of its larger ramifications to the society.
 
 Alwar police on Sept 23 arrested 60-year-old self-styled godman   for allegedly raping a 21-year-old girl from Chattisgarh.
 
 Alwar district police acted on a zero FIR on the incident lodged by the family of the victim at Bilaspur police station in Chhattisgarh. The case was subsequently handed over to   police station in Alwar where the alleged crime took place. 
 
 In her statement, the rape victim had said that she had visited  , the ashram of the godman, on August 7 last year. She offered her first salary from the internship to the 'godman', who asked her to stay for the night. While she stayed, the 'godman' invited her in his room at 7 pm and raped her. The 'godman' is also accused of threaten the rape survivor, saying his followers were high ranking politicians and top cops and nothing happen to him even if she complains.
