CHENNAI: The meeting of Aam Aadmi Party president and   with actor   on Thursday has sent a wave of excitement through the rank and file of the party in Chennai. Ahead of the local body elections in the state,   joining the party in their fight against corruption.

 When Kejriwal landed at the Chennai airport, Kamal Haasan’s daughter Akshara Haasan was there to receive him, a gesture that pleased AAP cadres. Kejriwal and Kamal Haasan had earlier met in Delhi two months ago when the actor discussed corruption and other political issues plaguing the nation.
 
 AAP state spokesperson M Lenin said, “Kamal Haasan’s views on social issues are as mature as that of a seasoned politician. People in the state view him as a force that can stand against corruption. His entry into the party will certainly boost its chances in future polls.” Less than a hundred cadres of AAP were present to receive their leader as the arrival of Kejriwal was not known to many.
 
 Lenin said, “The prospect of Kamal Haasan joining the party has raised a lot of expectations among the lower ranks. If a popular face like Kamal Haasan joins AAP, it will bring back cadres who deserted the party over the last few years.” Only about a dozen cadres were present outside Kamal Haasan’s Alwarpet residence during the hour-long meeting. Kamal Haasan fans though were not to be seen.
 
 AAP did not contest the 2016 Tamil Nadu assembly election. When the party contested the 2014 general elections in the state, it had only managed a vote share of 0.5%.
 
 A section of the AAP cadres were, however, of the opinion that the party could do without Kamal Haasan. But, seniors in the party firmly believe that Kamal Haasan entering AAP’s state unit could change the political landscape in the state, post-Jayalalithaa, and boost the party’s image at a national level. Sources in AAP said Kejriwal and Kamal Haasan are set to have another meeting soon.
