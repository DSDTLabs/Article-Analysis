AURANGABAD: A woman whose husband was suspected to have been murdered about a month-and-a-half-ago is now claiming that he may be alive. 

 The woman told the police that she is confident her husband, Amol Sable, will return home one day, as nobody in the family was shown the body before cremation.
 
 When contacted, Aurangabad rural superintendent of police   said the police are waiting for the   of the man whose body parts were found on the railway tracks last month. 
 
 "However, some members of the Sable family identified the man from his belongings. We are still trying to ascertain if it is a case of suicide or murder," Reddy told TOI.
 
 The police registered a   after the throat and wrists of the victim were found to have been slit during post-mortem by the   and Hospital.
 
 The case was first reported by the driver of the   train that ran over the victim on the morning of January 13.
 
 Amol, a resident of Brijwadi, was into Ponzi schemes and also did marketing for some herbal products. 
 
 The identity of the man was established by police through his car registration, clothes and other belongings.
 
 Amol's father, Murlidhar, too is suspicious. "Neither my wife Vaishali nor I was allowed to see the body, because of which we both feel that it was not Amol. We were told by the police that his face was damaged beyond recognition and that we would not be able to see that," he told TOI.
 
 Murlidhar said the recovery of his son's car and other belongings, including clothes and shoes, from the car were the only clues to indicate that it was Amol's body. "However, we still can't believe it was his body."
 
 The father also demanded that police should thoroughly investigate the case to establish facts. "If my son has indeed been murdered, the case should be cracked and the guilty arrested," he added.
