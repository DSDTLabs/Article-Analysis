Bangladeshi superstar Shakib Khan, who is starring in the Dhanukas’   with Srabanti and Paayel Sarkar, has been divorced from wife Apu. The duo, who secretly got married in 2008, parted ways last year after   opened up on their marriage. In Kolkata, where Apu halted for a few hours before going to Siliguri recently, she apparently met Shakib with son Joy. Though the unit, which was busy with the film’s photoshoot, was privy to the father-son bonding, Shakib and Apu barely spoke.
