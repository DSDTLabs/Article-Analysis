AMARAVATI: The political temperature is increasing by the day in   with TDP and   leaders hurling accusations at each other. Speculation is rife that the TDP-BJP alliance will break up any time as the leaders of the two parties are passing the buck and justifying their own stands. 

 BJP MLAs P Vishnukumnar Raju, Akula Satyanarayana and MLCs Somu Veerraju and P N V   were vociferous on Tuesday, turning tables on the TDP when the issue of funds granted to the state by the Centre cropped up. Besides, they also levelled allegations of corruption against the TDP leaders. 
 
 The BJP leaders took strong exception to TDP Visakhapatnam East legislator V Ganesh leading a protest on Monday where the activists used footwear on Prime Minister  's photo. They demanded that the TDP legislator be arrested. BJP floor leader P   alleged that TDP Vizag urban unit vice-president  , who was active in the protest insulting the PM, was an accused in a murder case. 
 
 The TDP leaders ridiculed their BJP counterparts, reducing them to street-level leaders. Chief whip Palle Raghunadha Reddy asked the BJP to implement all promises made to the state. He also asked the BJP MPs from the state to join the protest being staged by AP MPs in Parliament.
 
 Meanwhile, TDP MLC Dokka Manikya Varaprasad made an appeal to Congress, Left and YSR Congress to back Chandrababu Naidu in fighting for the Special Category Status.
