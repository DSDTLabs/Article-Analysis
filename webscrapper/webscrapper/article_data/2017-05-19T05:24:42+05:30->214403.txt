AHMEDABAD: Cinema, earlier rightly called the motion pictures, employs the technique of showing pictures at a high frame rate, creating 'movement.' Thus, when the grand scale extravaganza is planned for silver screen, the makers employ the technique of   where the scene is divided shot by shot for better planning. 

 Interestingly, the technique of storyboard was apparently also employed in 1790-1800 AD - 113 years before the first film was made in India. On the International Museum Day on Thursday, a new gallery at   titled ' : Pahari School Ramayana Drawings' exhibited a series of folios, selected from a total of 52 from   Collection - a historic collection of Indian art objects.
 
 Museum director Professor Ratan Parimoo discovered the set -- beginning with announcement of Lord Rama's coronation and ending with his younger brother Bharat returning with Lord Rama's wooden slippers -- sometime back and got it restored. The folios, dating back to late 18th century covering the entire Ayodhya Kand have line drawings on front and description on the back.
