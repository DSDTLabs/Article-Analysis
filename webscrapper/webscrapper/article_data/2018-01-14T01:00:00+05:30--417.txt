Manveer Gurjar, former ' ' winner has found a special friend in tellyland —  . Manveer says it is difficult to make friends in showbiz and therefore he has been very careful while connecting with people. 
After winning 'Bigg Boss' last year, Manveer was spotted with   a few times. A couple of months later, rumours of the two dating started doing the rounds. Ask Manveer about this and he says, “I have enough issues on the personal front. After I won Bigg Boss, I was surrounded by controversies regarding my marriage. Right now I am waiting for my divorce to come through. Hence, I don’t like people asking me about my personal life. I want to focus on my work. About Kamya, I will not deny that she is someone extremely special. Rather, she is the only one who supported me and guided me in the industry. I was introduced to her by my maternal uncle and in her I found a real, true friend. I am not dating her but Kamya is the only person who has been there for me in Mumbai. I would not like to get into what the future holds for us.”
 Kamya however denied anything more than a friendship between the two. She said, “I have been very vocal about my feelings and have never shied away from admitting to my relationships. When I loved   (Patel) I said it out loud. And I also said that he was not my friend because he was more than a friend. But Manveer is my friend. He is a great guy and I have supported him in his work. I would not like to say anything more on this because people should understand that I have a daughter who also reads newspapers. People have to be sensitive before spreading rumours.”
