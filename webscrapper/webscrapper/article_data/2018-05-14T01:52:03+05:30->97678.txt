GURUGRAM:   has chalked up a plan to install 90 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the city, given its ever-decreasing groundwater levels. The   treated at these plants will be used for horticulture and other purposes.

 Of the total number, 87 micro STPs will be installed in parks across the city, wherever the corporation has a sewage network. An initial list of possible parks has been drawn up. After a survey is done to assess areas where water levels are critical, along with a sewage network nearby, the final list will be drawn up.
 
 “We have invited expression of interest for the project. Once we receive applications, we will analyse the offers and open tenders for placing bids,” said an MCG official. 
 
 Talking about the amount of water likely to be treated by these STPs, the official said that it would vary from one plant to another, given that the STPs will have a capacity of between 25 and 50 kilolitres per day each. Put together, the plants will treat a minimum of 2,175 kilolitres of sewage water per day. 
 
 In terms of cost, the officials said that a 25 kilolitre   costs around Rs 25 lakh, hence the minimum cost of the entire project would be around Rs 22 crore.
 
 MCG has sought   for the project from the central government, under the Amrut scheme. However, if the funds aren’t sanctioned under the central scheme, the corporation will fund the project on its own. 
 
 Other than these micro STPs, MCG is currently building a sewage treatment plant in Mohammadpur Jharsa which will have a capacity of treating 2 megalitres of sewage water per day, and another one is in the proposal stage.
 
 MCG commissioner   has reiterated on the need of sewage treatment plants in the city, given its fast depleting water tables. Yadav had earlier told TOI that MCG was mulling over installing multiple STPs in parks under the Gurugram Green Plan. The treated water from these plants would be used for meeting the water required for horticultural purposes in these parks.
