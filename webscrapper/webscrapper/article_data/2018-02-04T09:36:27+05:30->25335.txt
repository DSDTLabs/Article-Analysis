CHANDIGARH: Two countries were fighting it out for the ICC U-19 World Cup title but one state shouldered maximum responsibility. In the end, the Punjabis from India trumped the Punjabis from Australia.

 
 Mohali lad  , Amritsar's   and Chandigarh’s   laid their hands on the winner’s trophy while Australia captain  , whose roots are in Nawanshahr, and   (born in Chandigarh) had to be satisfied with second spot.
 
 There was massive Punjabi representation in the crowd too. Songs like ‘Ni lake teen peg balliye’ reverberated at the Bay Oval stadium, in Mount Maunganui, whenever there was a boundary or a six being hit.
 
 Performance-wise, Uppal outshone the rest as he scored 34 runs and picked up the prized wicket of Shubman Gill, who scored a 30-ball 31.
 
 Although Gill didn’t see the match through for the Indian team, his aggressive knock nipped Australia’s budding hopes. Abhishek Sharma bowled decently and returned with figures of 6-0-30-0 but it was skipper Sangha’s failure (13 off 24 balls) that cost Australia dearly.
 
 “It seemed as if we were playing in front of a home crowd. They were cheering us and it was really inspiring,” Shubman told TOI from Tauranga, New Zealand.
 
 “I am really happy and proud the way our team performed throughout the tournament. We defeated every opposition convincingly and that’s the best part of this triumph.”
 
 On the atmosphere, allrounder Abhishek Sharma, who comes from Amritsar, said, “We have dreamt of this from last year and finally here we are. On top of the world.”
 
 “Both of us (Shubman and Abhishek) try to keep the energy level and spirits of the team high. Whenever the team is tense, we crack a joke and instantly the situation becomes far lighter. The team performs better if they are relaxed rather than being tensed,” he added.
 
 Arshdeep, who broke into a bhangra after India’s win, said, “It’s time for celebration. It is a great feeling to win the World Cup. I am very grateful to be a part of this team.”
