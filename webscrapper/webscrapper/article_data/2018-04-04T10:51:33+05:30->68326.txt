TRICHY: A 36-year-old quack practising allopathic medicine was arrested by the police after a team from the district administration exposed him at his centre in   on the city outskirts on Tuesday afternoon. Police also arrested a 33-year-old woman for illegally performing medical termination of pregnancy. 

 The quacks were identified as   from Rajapalayam and   from Thuvarankurichi. The Thuvarankurichi police also detained three women working at the hospital. 
 
 A team headed by Dr S   Begum, joint director of health services (JDHS), Trichy, visited DC hospital in the bazaar in Thuvarankurichi on Tuesday. 
 
 They found seven patients waiting at the eight-bedded hospital while ‘Dr Chinnathambi’ was treating a patient. Dr Samasath, who went undercover as a patient, told the staff that she had an ulcer and needed treatment. 
 
 The quack checked the blood pressure and diabetic level of the Dr Samsath. The moment he started prescribing medicines, the police team entered the hospital and surrounded the quack and the others. 
 
 “When I asked about his qualification, he said he is BE MS. He also said that Dr Babu and he have been running the hospital and that Babu has gone for higher studies. Our investigation revealed that he had no basic qualification and is unfit to be a doctor,” Dr Samsath told TOI. 
 
 Verification of Podhumani’s credentials also revealed that she did not have any medical qualification. Dr Samsath Begum said that Podhumani had been performing medical termination of pregnancy on women in the centre during the night.
 
 The raid was carried out following complaints from the public to the Trichy police. The team also nabbed three women working at the centre while their credentials are yet to be verified.
 
 The team also seized medicines before sealing down the hospital.
