NEW DELHI: Delhi government cabinet on Friday gave the green signal for an out-of-turn promotion to Olympic wrestler Sakshi Malik’s father,  . While the government had announced the promotion last year, after news of Sakshi’s bronze at the Rio Olympics, the move couldn’t go through because of service rules of the state bus agency,  .

 On Friday, deputy chief minister   announced the decision of the Delhi cabinet to bypass the DTC service rule. Sisodia said, “The matter had been sent to the DTC board for approval but the board said it could not clear the proposal due to service policies.” According to Sisodia, DTC service rules say that out-of-turn promotions are possible only if the employee has an impeccable annual confidential report over previous three years, which   did not have.
