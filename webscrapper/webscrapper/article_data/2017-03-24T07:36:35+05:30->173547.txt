AGARTALA: Five days after a suspect in the 2005   was nabbed and flown to Bengaluru, top intelligence officials of the state on Thursday said he has been charged with helping the main accused in the terror attack,  , cross the India-Bangladesh border twice. 

 According to reports,   (37) was involved in mapping the routes to facilitate the terror team from Bangladesh to Agartala. "He was actively involved with LeT terrorists," police officials said. 
 
 Habib was arrested from his residence at Jogendranagar under East Agartala police station a week ago. A chargesheet was filed and a permanent warrant issued against him on the basis of Sabauddin's confession. 
 
 Habib has been remanded to police custody till March 27. The  , which is investigating the case, is hopeful of obtaining information from him about the whereabouts of the seven other accused in the case, police sources said.
 
 Sabauddin was arrested nine years ago from Nepal and confessed he was asked by Pakistan-based Lashkar handler Abdul Aziz to travel to Bangladesh to "finalize" a terror attack in Bengaluru in 2005, police said. Agartala was one of the closest points of entry into Bangladesh and he had travelled to Tripura to gain entry into the neighbouring country, police added, referring to Sabauddin's statement.
 
 "Sabauddin met Habib at a mosque in Agartala and sought his help to travel to Bangladesh. Sabauddin's maternal side of the family lives in Comilla and he would often visit Bangladesh without a passport," police said Sabauddin had told them in 2008.
 
 Evidence pointed to fake passports having originated from Tripura and a section of civil administration officers were also found to be involved, officials said. The investigation had made no headway, however, officials added.
