MUMBAI: A survey of 53 public utility buildings conducted under the union government's   showed that Mumbai is not a friendly place for the  . 

 Eight out of 10 buildings don't have ramps as an alternative to stairs for wheelchair-bound people. “Moreover, 92% of these ramps didn't have the right slope as per accessibility standards. How can wheelchairs manoeuvre steep ramps?” asked   of the Delhi-based  , which audited eight cities for the Accessible India campaign. 
 
 “Around 96% of the public buildings we audited don't have an   for the disabled people. Nine out of 10 buildings didn't have handrails along the stairways or ramps,” she added. 
 
 Despite thousands visiting the Marine Drive or the Worli walkway daily, these structures aren't accessible places for the disabled; there are no drinking water facilities or toilets modified for their use. Even public hospitals don't have accessible toilets or parking bays for the disabled. 
 
 The Accessible India campaign provides funds to introduce disabled-friendly infrastructure, but no two municipal corporations follow the same standards, Jindal said. “Accessibility standards are the same across the globe. We don't have to rethink how kerb ramps have to laid or what signage should be used,'' said Jindal, who presented civic officials with a Handbook on Barrier Free Urban Infrastructure, compiled by Svayam, on Republic Day.
 
 Jindal, who is wheelchair-bound, said, “It is not only the disabled, but even the elderly or freshly injured people who need an accessible access to buildings and infrastructure.” 
 
 It is estimated that 3% of India is disabled. “But this estimate needs to be reworked as the Disability Act was recently amended,” she said.
