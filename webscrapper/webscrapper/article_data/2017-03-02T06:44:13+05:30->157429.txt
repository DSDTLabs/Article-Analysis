AHMEDABAD: The July 11, 2016, incident in which some Dalits in   were brutally flogged shook the conscience of the nation and triggered Dalit protests in  . 

 What is disturbing is that the Una atrocity was one of the 1,355 inflicted on Scheduled Castes in Gujarat in 2016, the highest in a year in the past 16 years! The year 2016 also recorded the highest number of rapes and murder of Dalits since 2001. 
 
 Data obtained through   from the office of   (DGP) revealed that nearly four cases of atrocities were registered daily in the state in 2016. In 2001, 1,034 atrocity cases were recorded with the second highest (1,165 cases) recorded in 2008.
 
 A record 32 Dalits were murdered in the state in 2016. Ironically, 2017 has also begun on a bloody note with the brutal murder on February 28 of Dalit sarpanch of   village in Amreli district, Jaysukh Madhad.
 
 In 2016, 80 cases of Dalit women being raped were recorded. This was an alarming rise from 9 recorded in 2001. Apart from major offences like murder and rape, 88 cases of grievous hurt and 12 cases of arson were reported last year. On July 11 last year, four Dalit youths were flogged and paraded half-naked at Una by self-styled 'gau rakshaks' for skinning a dead cow.
 
 RTI activist   obtained the data collated from 40 police headquarters from across 33 districts of the state.
 
 "These are just reported crimes. There would be many unreported incidents of atrocity inflicted on Scheduled Castes largely due to social prejudice and lack of stringent action by the state government," Kaushik said.
 
 Jignesh Mevani, convener of Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch (RDAM), said the figures prove growing caste prejudice in the state.
 
 "Three Dalits were killed in police firing at Thangadh in September 2012. That and the recent murder of Dalit sarpanch in Amreli are instances of the brutality inflicted on Scheduled Castes in Gujarat. In fact, the Una agitation was a manifestation of pent up Dalit anger," Mevani said.
 
 Social justice and welfare minister Atmaram Parmar was not available for his comments despite repeated attempts to contact him failed.
