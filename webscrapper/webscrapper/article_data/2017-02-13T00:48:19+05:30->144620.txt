NAVI MUMBAI: While other political parties are yet to reveal their list of star campaigners, chief minister Devendra   will be the star campaigner for BJP for the ensuing   and   polls slated for February 21. He is scheduled to address BJP’s rally on Wednesday at 2 pm at the Bhumiputra ground in sector 19,  . 

 Local party functionaries are hoping that the CM’s visit will turn the table in their favour. During the Uran Municipal Council poll in November last year, CM’s rally in Uran worked wonders as BJP wrested power despite parting ways from its old ally Shiv Sena.
