PATNA: After an eight-month delay, the six   active in the state are finally ready to conduct preparatory activities for their district-wise joint conventions, rallies and demonstrations over the next 15 days beginning Tuesday. The activities will finally take the shape of a joint demonstration of the Left parties in Patna on May 23.

 “The May 23 demonstration is part of the nationwide call given by the national coordination committee of the Left parties to hold processions in all the state capitals against the anti-people policies of the   government at the Centre,” state secretary of CPI Satya   said.
 
 He clarified that the six Left parties active in the state – CPI (ML), CPI,  , Socialist Unity Centre of India, Revolutionary Socialist Party and Forward Bloc – will not hold rally in Patna on May 23. Instead, it will be a protest demonstration and procession which will begin from Gandhi Maidan.
 
 The Patna procession will be preceded by two phases of activities over 15 days from Tuesday. “The Left parties will complete their district level joint conventions by May 15. It would be followed by dharnas and demonstrations in pursuance of their demands at the panchayat, block and district levels from May 17 to 22.
 
 Although the decision to hold nationwide procession on May 23 with regard to the 26-point charter of demands was taken in September last year, the joint preparatory activities were delayed due to two main reasons. First, the three major Left parties – CPM, CPI and CPI (ML) – got busy in making preparations for their respective national congresses which were scheduled for March-April. Secondly, there was “unresolved internal debate” within the CPM over the party’s likely alliance with the   and other democratic parties during the 2019 polls to stop the march of the BJP under the stewardship of PM Narendra   and its national president Amit Shah.
