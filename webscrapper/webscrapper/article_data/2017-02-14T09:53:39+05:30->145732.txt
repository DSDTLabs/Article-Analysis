AHMEDABAD:  , 41, hit the headlines in April last year when she decided to tie the knot with  , 23, the resident of an Amraiwadi slum. A health coordinator from Montana, Emily has taken to her new life like a fish to water – as she puts it – and one year later is not bothered about the sea change their union has brought about.

 They met online and Hitesh’s honesty about his humble origins won her over and she decided to marry him. Moreover, she adapted to life in a two-room shanty in the city’s Amraiwadi area.
 
 About the last year, she said love teaches you to take life as it come – sometimes great and sometimes worse. “I don’t yearn for material happiness. Money cannot buy it. I can feel Hitesh’s love which is priceless. I have learned to cook Gujarati food as my husband doesn’t like Western food. I enjoy doing the chores and for me no work is small – fetching water or taking care of his family,” she said.
 
 Tammy said the language barrier still exists and that is more challenging than the lifestyle adjustment she had to make. “So many people talk to me or wish to talk to me but I can’t understand most of it. I am enamoured by the affection I get,” she said.
 
 For Hitesh, the union brought a few practical difficulties. “We used to take state transport buses but are tired of the constant stares we get and thus have to hire a private vehicle now. She has learned a few Gujarati words which is great,” he said.
 
 The duo went to the US once and want to go again. However, Hitesh said that they don’t wish to settle there. “We live with my uncle and aunt who have raised me after my parents’ deaths. As they have no children, I am their child and will take care of them,” he said.
 
 For the couple, his native place near Ahmedabad is the perfect getaway for them to celebrate Valentine’s Day on Tuesday, as they plan their life ahead.
