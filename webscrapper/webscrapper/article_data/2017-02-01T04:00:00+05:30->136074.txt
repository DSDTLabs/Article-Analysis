Vadodara: Commuters will be able to soon glide on the busy R C Dutt Road. The district collector, police commissioner, district development officer, inspector general of police and other senior government officers have agreed to let go a portion of the government land in their bungalows for widening the road. The decision was taken during a meeting between municipal commissioner Dr Vinod Rao, city police commissioner, Manoj Sashidhar, district collector Lochan Sehra and other senior government officers on Monday.  Demolition of the walls of their bungalows will be undertaken soon. “I am extremely thankful for this gesture. Earlier the royal family gave consent to give their land for road widening and now the senior government officers too have agreed. This establishes that law is same for everyone. The R C Dutt Road will now be in its fully glory,” Rao told TOI.  The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has undertaken a major demolition drive in different areas of the city to broaden the roads and improve the infrastructure. “Wider roads will be good for the city as the traffic will ease and the quality of life will improve. We are supporting the move as it is for the betterment of the city,” Sashidhar said. All the government officers have taken a token Re 1 from the VMC towards rent and agreed to part with a portion of their land.  “We are all contributing to make Vadodara a smart city. The broadening of the busy R C Dutt Road will benefit the public so we decided to part with the land. About five feet of the land of all the bungalows on this road will be given away for road broadening,” Sehra said. The civic body has already begun demolition of walls of the Police Bhavan on the Central Jail Road.
