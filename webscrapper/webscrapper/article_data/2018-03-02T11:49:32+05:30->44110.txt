TRICHY: PMK leader Dr S Ramadoss has condemned the move by the   and natural gas to expand the   refinery (CBR) at Narimanam in Nagapattinam district and sought the help of the state government for it. 

 In a statement issued here on Thursday, the PMK leader demanded the Tamil Nadu government not to acquire 600 acres of cultivable land for the expansion of the CBR as demanded by the Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan. Ramadoss termed the proposed expansion of the refinery a disastrous plan to turn Cauvery basin into a desert. 
 
 “The annual refinery capacity at Narimanam stood at 10 lakh tonne. The new project is proposed to increase the capacity to one crore tonne for which nine refineries are going to be set up. The expansion of the refinery will result in multiplication of environmental hazards by 10 times of the present effect,” Ramadoss said. 
 
 Ramadoss also highlighted the skin diseases and breathing problems resulting from oil wells in   in Tiruvarur district. “The life span of the people in the village came down to 50 years due to the health problems caused by the refinery. The problems started surfacing in  . If additional wells are set up, the Cauvery basin will be a place unfit for people to live in,” alleged Ramadoss.
