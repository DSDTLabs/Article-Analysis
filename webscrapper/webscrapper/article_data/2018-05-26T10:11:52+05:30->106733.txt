LUCKNOW: Cut fruits, dates, sherbet and fried snacks have been laid out in colourful symmetry on the tables. Rozedaars, who have come to shop or for work in and around the Aminabad-Nazirabad area are freely welcome to the restaurants for iftaar. They don't have to pay for it, nor loiter around the bazaar in the inability to reach home in time. The shop-owners have their doors wide open for all during  . 

 As a tradition that has been going on for years, the shopkeepers and restaurants in the   serve rozedaars as a service in the holy month. What they get in return, they say, is reward for serving those who are fasting and the joy of being able to serve humanity. 
 
  
 
 
 Owner of   in   area,  , who has been a witness to the practice since his childhood days, said: "From the first of Ramzan, we have the iftari prepared for anyone who wants to come in and break their fast. We have a separate cook for preparing the iftaari and fruits are cut at our home by the women of the house. Everyone is welcome to break their fast."
 
 A similar scene is visible at Alamgir hotel inside the dingy lane opposite   cinema hall that now stands shut. As evening falls, owner Mujeeb, takes his place at the cash counter kept outside the dining area and ushers anyone wanting to break the fast. 
 
 In the next couple of minutes, rozedaars come in a beeline to the lane, looking for a place to break their fast and Mujeeb welcomes them inside. " Haan bhai, khaana khane aae hain ya iftaar karne? (Yes brother, have you come to have dinner or for iftar)," said Mujeeb as he ushered the rozedaars inside the outlet. "At the time of iftar, we do not serve meals on our menu. Those are available only after roza for the day is done."
