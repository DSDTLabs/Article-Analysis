 At the police station, Thakkar admitted to have stolen the motorcycle from Dahanukar Colony on Sunday, Deshmukh said. “During questioning, Thakkar said he had stolen 10 more motorcycles, apart from the one with which he was caught, from various parts of the city. We recovered six motorcycles from him. There are no complaints about the remaining five bikes,” he added.
 
 The officer said Thakkar is from an affluent family, was running a business and owned a high-end motorcycle. “The man said he started stealing motorcycles as he did not have any bike ever since his business ran into losses,” he added.
