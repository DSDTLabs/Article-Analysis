NAVI MUMBAI: Residents in   developed nodes like Kharghar, Taloja, Ulwe, Dronagiri and nearby villages will have to brace for two-day   on March 7 and 8 due to urgent repair works to be undertaken in   dam supply system. 

 Cidco has announced shutdown in these nodes from 9am Tuesday to 9am Wednesday.
 
 Residents have expressed discontent over the ensuing shutdown, as they are already facing acute water shortage for the past two weeks. This has forced them to undertake protest marches to Cidco offices in the last few days. However, Cidco sources claimed that the shutdown will help them resolve the water problem in these nodes and restore supply in a week’s time.
 
 “We get no or low-pressure supply for almost a week after repairs. It has become a monthly feature now. We have to run from pillar to post to fetch water. Tanker mafia makes a killing during these days of scarcity,” said Suraj Srinivas, a Kharghar resident.
 
 Cidco officials said that there will be low-pressure supply for a few hours even after resumption. The enroute areas, through which the pipeline runs from Hetawane dam to the city via Jite treatment plant, will also be affected during the shutdown.
 
  Mohan Ninawe, senior public relations officer of Cidco, said, “We will be unable to supply water to these nodes for at least 24 hours due to repairs in the Hetawane water supply scheme. All the residents of these nodes and enroute villages are requested to store water during the shutdown period.”
 
 Rajesh Haatvar, executive engineer of water supply department in Cidco told TOI, “This shutdown will plug minor leakages in certain areas which will help us improve supply. A couple of days after shutdown, residents are likely to get low-pressure supply.”
