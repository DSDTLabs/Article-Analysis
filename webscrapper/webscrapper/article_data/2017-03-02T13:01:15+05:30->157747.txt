 Shroff turns 27 today and the actor who doesn't believe in throwing grand bashes, will ring in his special day with a working birthday on the sets of 'Munna Michael'. He will be shooting in Vasai for the most part of the day but sister Krishna who is an assistant director on the   directorial, is ensuring that her big brother, who is otherwise a fitness freak, breaks his strict diet and eat a slice of cake.

  
  
 Speaking to Mirror, Krishna says, "Tiger has always disliked any kind of attention that his birthday brings. He's been celebrating it on a film set since the last couple of years and he's happy about it, often saying that he's blessed to be working on the day." But the actor always manages to take some time out to chat with his fans and open their presents. "This time we'll be together and I've made him promise that we'll both cheat on our diet together and actually eat some cake. We are shooting an action sequence so he'll burn off the calories anyway," Krishna laughs.
 
 Producer   informs that they will be filming on a highway which has been specially blocked for the shoot. "It's going to be a tiring day for Tiger. It's a regular shift and we'll only pack up late in the evening. But we will surely cut a cake and hopefully party later," he says.
 
 Once 'Munna Michael' wraps up, Tiger will kick off two sequels,  's 'Student of the Year 2' and Sajid Nadiadwala's 'Baaghi 2'.
