INDORE: While the incidents of fire at Devguradia   is not knew and various   were reported even last year, the collector had announced in June 2016 that the trenching ground would be shifted to a new place away from the  

 But a year later, officials have not taken even a single step forward. Initially, land near   was chosen for the purpose but the decision was taken back following protest from villagers.
 
 “Choosing a place for a trenching ground is not easy. We have to keep in mind the concern of the people. We are looking for a suitable place for a new trenching ground,” collector P Narahari said.
 
 Officials of the civic body said that they had made plans to prevent similar incidents and the same would not occur again.
 
 “It is because of the steps taken by us in the last one year that we were able to restrict fires to particular areas of the trenching ground. We expect the waste to energy conversion plant to be up and running by the end of this year as it would help us get rid of the problem completely,” said Rohan Saxena, additional commissioner.
