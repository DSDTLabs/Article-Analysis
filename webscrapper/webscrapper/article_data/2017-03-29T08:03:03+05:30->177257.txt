NEW DELHI: A 37-year-old   was raped and strangled at her house in   by a neighbour for refusing to marry him even after being in a relationship with him.

 Police have arrested the accused, Qayum alias Kalim, from Noida. Qayum, a native of Saharsa in Bihar, worked as a rickshaw puller. He met the woman at a construction site, where she worked as a labourer and started staying with her.
 
 Qayum told officers that the woman had started ignoring him because of her proximity with another man in the locality. Qayum said that when he accused her of cheating on him, she threatened to leave him. Qayum then threatened her with dire consequences if she continued to meet the other man.
 
 Qayum said that on Sunday night when the woman was alone in her room, he barged in and tried to convince her to move in with him. He wanted to take her to his village and get married, which she refused. This led to an argument, during which Qayum raped her first and then strangled her with a dupatta.
 
 He then left the body on the bed and took her mobile phone before leaving, said a senior police officer. The incident was reported on Monday morning when a contractor from the construction site where the woman worked visited her home.
 
 “Qayum was arrested while he was planning to flee to his hometown,” said Omvir Singh, DCP east.
