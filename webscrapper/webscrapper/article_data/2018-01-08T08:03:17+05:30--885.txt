LUCKNOW: In a decision that will affect around 10,000   aspirants,   has decided to conduct last session's PhD   in the academic session 2018-19. 

 Last year, the university could not begin its PhD admission process as the revised PhD ordinance was not approved by Raj Bhawan.
 
  LU spokesperson   said admissions will be done in the new academic session as soon as the ordinance gets a final assent from the governor. This means double competition this year. Every year, for around 600 PhD seats at the university, more than 3,500 candidates apply. This year, the number of seats will remain the same but candidates will double as both 2017 and 2018 aspirants will opt for doctoral studies.
 
 PhD admissions were to begin in September first week last year. However, LU sent the ordinance, which was passed in August, to the governor on September 15. The governor, the chancellor of state universities, sent back the ordinance with several objections in October.
 
 He had sought to know the basis of extra weightage to   and National Eligibility Test qualified candidates in the merit index and at which level would weightage be given. 
 
 LU had sent the revised ordinance in November but it is still to get approval.
 
 "The admission process for undergraduate courses will begin from March 19. Both admissions will be done simultaneously if the ordinance is finalized," said an LU official.
