HYDERABAD: Days after grabbing headlines for rolling into Gandhi   in his son’s toy cycle after failing to get a  ,   has been shifted to the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (Nims) for complicated macro vascular surgery.

 The surgery is being done to cover the gaps in his scalp due to 7% burns that   suffered during Diwali last year. “Our team of plastic surgeons have advised this shift as he needs ‘scalp free surgery’ which requires a lot of expertise and caution,” Dr Sravan, superintendent of the hospital, told TOI. Raju was shifted a day before Ugadi and has been kept under muscle strengthening medicines. Unlike his tricycle episode, Raju walked into Nims using a stick as the condition of his limbs have improved after treatment.
 
 Doctors said the plastic surgery, which would have cost Raju around Rs 10 lakh in a private hospital, will be performed free of cost. When first admitted to   last year, Raju had been hospitalised for 63 days and a team of plastic surgeons had performed surgery on him. “He was in a condition that he could not move his limbs. His condition improved later so that he could move his limbs. The treatment would have cost him about Rs 40 lakh outside,” said Dr Subhodh, professor in the plastic surgery department of Gandhi Hospital. The surgery to be performed now needs extreme care as vessels from other parts of his body need to be taken and adjusted near the scalp, he added.
