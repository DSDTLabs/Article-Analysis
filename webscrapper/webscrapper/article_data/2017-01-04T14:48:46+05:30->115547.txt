PATNA: The ferry service introduced by the district administration for   is turning out to be a hit among the pilgrims.

 The three steamers introduced by the administration are making at least four trips a day, giving free rides to pilgrims from   to Gai Ghat and Gandhi Ghat. On Tuesday, the pilgrims were seen enjoying the ride by using public address system installed on these steamers to sing songs in the praise of Guru Gobind Singh. 
 
 The pilgrims, it seems, are enjoying the calm and cool breeze flowing in the Ganga and not leaving any chance to capture the moments in their cameras. Soon after MV Kastoorba left Kangan Ghat for Gai Ghat on Tuesday, Vijay Kumar of Inland   spotted a woman pilgrim reciting hymns with closed eyes and folded hands. Vijay slowly held the mike in front of her mouth and her hymns caught everyone by surprise. The pilgrim, Rajinder Kaur, later realised that she was on mike. “I was singing ‘shabad’ of Guru Gobind Singh,” she said.
 
 Riya Nirdha from Nagpur then took the mike from Kaur and started singing ‘simran’. Soon, around 150 pilgrims present on the steamer started reciting the lines of the religious hymns. Riya’s two sisters Deepa Nirdha and Mone Nirdha also joined her and they sang ‘Waho waho Gobind Singh Ji’ amid applause from the audience.
 
 The Nirdha sisters said they have come here in a jattha of 450 persons from Nagpur “We are here till January 7,” she added.
 
 Several other pilgrims were either seen capturing the serenity of the Ganga or clicking selfies.
