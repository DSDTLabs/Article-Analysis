PATNA: Evaluation of Intermediate answer books remained paralysed at all eight centres in the state capital for the second consecutive day on Saturday with teachers of affiliated unaided colleges boycotting work in support of their multiple demands.

 The demands include pay parity to teachers working at affiliated colleges under the unaided education policy of the government. “The government had promised to release funds for unaided colleges. However, no financial assistance has come from the government, leaving teachers in a state of penury,” said an agitating teacher.
 
 B D College principal Sanjoy Kumar said most of the examiners were from affiliated colleges. “These teachers have paralysed the evaluation work. A strong mob entered the college Saturday and forced other examiners to boycott the evaluation work,” Kumar added.
 
 The agitating teachers forced examiners to boycott evaluation work at A N College, College of Commerce, Arts and Science and J D Women’s College centres too. “If the deadlock persists, evaluation work would be badly affected and it would also lead to delay in publication of results,” said director of an evaluation centre. 
 
 Meanwhile, some examination controllers complained that the BSEB did not supply identity cards for examiners in adequate number. The marking scheme, which is mandatory for each examiner to follow, was also not given to some centres.
 
 The BSEB has set up 73 centres in the state, including eight in the state capital, for evaluation of answer books of Intermediate examinations.
