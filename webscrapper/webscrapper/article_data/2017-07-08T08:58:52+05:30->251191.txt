CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister  , on Friday, wrote to Prime Minister   expressing concern over a  , saying it was aimed at preventing Indian fishermen from exercising their traditional fishing rights in the Palk Bay.

 “I am writing with deep concern about the new Fisheries bill that is reportedly introduced and passed in the Sri Lankan Parliament, prohibiting certain fishing methods including bottom trawling,” he wrote. 
 
 “It is widely reported in a section of media that under the provisions of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Amendment) Bill, the fishing trawlers as well as fishing gear used for fishing in the Sri Lankan territorial waters will be confiscated, fishermen imprisoned for two years and huge fines upto 50,000 Lankan Rupees will be imposed,” he wrote.
 
 The passing of the “ill-advised” bill came at a time when the ministers of India and Sri Lanka as well as the Joint Working Group on Fisheries had met only recently to resolve the Indo-Sri Lankan fishermen issues and therefore it was “shocking,” he said.
 
 He said this “unilateral move” by Colombo will “definitely hamper” the joint initiatives taken by the governments of the two countries on the fishermen issue.
 
 He requested the Centre to “register its strongest disapproval of such a move and must organize an effective defense of the rights of our fishermen in the Palk Bay”. He also appealed to the PM to direct the External Affairs Ministry and Indian Mission in Lanka to "immediately, appropriately and effectively respond” to this move.
 
 They should register “strong protest" and should ensure that necessary provisions are made in the new legislation to exempt the traditional waters of Palk Bay from its purview, he said.
