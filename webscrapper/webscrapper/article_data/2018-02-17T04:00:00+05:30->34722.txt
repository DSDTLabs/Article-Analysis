Vadodara: After 11 years, M S University’s syndicate members are expected to take a decision in the case against professor Shivaji Panikkar, the former in-charge dean of Faculty of Fine Arts, who was suspended after the ‘obscenity row’ that had rocked the famed faculty in 2007.  On Monday, an inquiry committee’s report against Panikkar, who is currently working with the School of Culture and Creative Expressions at Ambedkar University, Delhi will be placed before the university’s syndicate members.  The developments are coming at a time when Chandra Mohan, the former student of Faculty of Fine Arts, who was at the centre of the controversy for drawing nude paintings of Gods and Goddess, had set ablaze university head office after being “frustrated” as the university has withheld his results since last 11 years. MSU’s saffron-linked syndicate members are expected to take a hard line in the case against Panikkar. The syndicate’s agenda itself mentions that the “in-charge dean who had been involved in misconduct with regard to exhibition of arti facts to God and Goddesses for public display at Faculty of Fine Arts in May 2007 created and caused communal disharmony in the society”.  After the obscenity row on May 9, 2017, Panikkar, had decided to support a decision taken by students of the faculty to put up an exhibition dealing with the long history of erotica in both Indian and Western art. He, however, faced ‘disciplinary action’ after he refused to abide by the directives of the then university officials to close down the exhibition.  The professor was later suspended by MSU but is still awaiting pending dues cleared from MSU. It was in December last that the report of the departmental inquiry headed by retired district judge A K Vaishya against Panikkar was placed before MSU’s syndicate members but the decision was deferred.
