JAIPUR: The   has directed the rural development and   not to reject applications of candidates from outside the state for the selection of Panchayat Gram Sahayaks.

 The single bench of Justice S P Sharma issued the order on a petition filed by Chandra Shekhar Kaushik and others.
 
 Munesh Bhardwaj, the counsel for the petitioner, said that, according to the guidelines issued by the department, it appeared that a candidate applying for the post must be a local resident of the district where the gram panchayat is located. The candidate should also have passed secondary as wells as senior secondary exams conducted by the Board of Secondary Education, Rajasthan.
 
 Due to the above provisions, the respondents were not accepting the applications of petitioners, the counsel said.
 
 The petitioners argued that the state government had only redesignated the post of Vidhyarthi Mitra as Gram Panchyat Sahayak and cannot incorporate provisions that were not applicable for Vidhyarthi Mitra.
 
 
 
 
 The high court has issued notices to chief secretary, additional chief secretary, the minority department and CEO of the Rajasthan Wakf Board for failing to comply with the quorum norm required to hold its meeting.
 
 According to petitioner Syed Nasser Hussain, the Wakf Board comprises nine membersâ€”four nominated and five selected from elected bodies.
 
 As per the provision, members selected from elected bodies should outnumber nominated members to form the quorum. However, no member from elected bodies has been selected to the Wakf Board to replace the vacancy created after the term of Rajya Sabha MP Ashk Ali Tak expired.
 
 As per practice, the outgoing member has to be invited to the board meeting till the new member has been selected. However, the Wakf Board meeting held on November 12 last year had neither informed the outgoing member nor selected a new member.
 
 So, the petitioner said the meeting of the board, which did not fulfill the quorum, was illegal.
