Hyderabad:   Pradesh   Committee (TPCC) president N Uttam Kumar Reddy on Tuesday said the sops announced by the TRS government to various sections in the state   2017-18 indicated that the “state is headed for a mid-term poll in 2018”.

 Uttam Kumar told media here that the government tried to lure some sections of backward classes (BCs) by offering various sops only to hide its “failure” to implement 12% quota for STs and Muslims, distribute three acres of land for Dalit families and other major promises. Raising serious doubts over the implementation of sops, he said it has become a habit with government to make false promises in budget speeches.
 
 “It is regrettable that irrigation minister T Harish Rao is not even aware of who finalises the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). States provide figures to the Centre. The Centre in turn decides the GSDP. The TRS government is providing wrong statistics to the Centre,” he alleged.
