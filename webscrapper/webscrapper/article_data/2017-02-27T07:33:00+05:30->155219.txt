CHANDIGARH: Congress leader Manpreet Singh Badal on Sunday said the first half of the   government at the Centre had so far witnessed only drum beating. The former Punjab finance minister alleged the   (BJP) government had failed to fulfil the promises made to people of the country before the 2014 general elections. “Modi’s achievement is that he made ‘jumla’ a household term, and the fact is that the nation is suffering,” he said in a statement.

 He said demonetisation sucked cash like a vacuum cleaner, and people were still bearing its brunt as businesses were hit, and so were rural wages and agricultural incomes. “The reality is that ATMs have no cash, and people are still bearing the brunt. Slowly and gradually, the effect of this unwitting decision is unravelling,” he said, adding that India’s economy had slowed sharply to a near three-year low in the final three months of last year. “The gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed to 6.4% annually in the October-December quarter, and economists have predicted a negative impact of the currency ban,” he added.
