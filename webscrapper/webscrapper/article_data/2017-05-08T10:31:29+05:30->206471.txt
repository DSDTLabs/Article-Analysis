PUNE: The Bombay high court has put on hold the government's move to dissolve Hinjewadi grampanchayat -one of the state's richest village bodies -which houses the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech (IT) Park.

 “No final order of dissolution of grampanchayat Hinjewadi, taluka Mulshi, shall be passed till next date,“ Justice R G Ketkar said in an order on Apirl 27. In another order on May 5, the single-judge bench reiterated its directive to the additional collector, Pune, and additional commissioner, Pune, to furnish the original records of an inquiry and orders passed in February and June last year, respectively, for disqualifying grampanchayat member   S  .
 
 Jambhulkar was the ninth of a total 17 elected members of the grampanchayat who were disqualified by the collector on grounds of encroachments on government land by either these members or their relatives.
 
 Eight other members, including the sarpanch and his deputy, were disqualified by an order on January 2 last year. The decision was subsequently upheld by the additional commissioner in an appeals process.
 
 “Jambhulkar's disqualification was done under political pressure and gives a chance to the government to remove the Congress-NCP control over the grampanchayat by dissolving it on the excuse of more than 50% vacant seats,“ her lawyer Chaitanya   told  . “We have challenged the very grounds shown by the government to disqualify her,“ Nikte said, adding that the outcome of her petition will decide the fate of the grampanchayat's existence.
 
 On April 10, the Mulshi Pan chayat Samiti issued notices to the panchayat members seeking explanation on why the panchayat should not be dissolved under the provisions of the Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act in view of more than 50% vacant seats caused by disqualification of nine members.
 
 The petitioner moved against this by seeking an interim relief from the high court. The matter has been posted for next hearing on June 29.
