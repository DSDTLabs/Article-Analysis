LUCKNOW: BSP   Anil   got his first share of political spotlight on Friday when he voted in favour of the BJP candidate in the   elections, playing a crucial role in the party’s victory.

 A first-time MLA from Purva assembly constituency in Unnao, Singh had left   chief   rattled on the eve of RS elections by quietly slipping out of a party meeting to meet CM Yogi Adityanath, triggering strong speculations of his defection towards the saffron camp.
 
 Not surprisingly, on Friday, Singh not only skipped the breakfast hosted by Mayawati but also refused to reach Vidhan Sabha along with the other 18 BSP MLAs. It was only two hours after 17 BSP MLAs had cast their votes that Singh arrived with NISHAD party MLA Vijay Mishra, who had announced support for the BJP candidate.
 
 
 Singh did not disclose where he voted but said he was in support of ‘Maharaj ji’ (Yogi). As if that was not enough, Singh found himself in the midst of another controversy, after BSP lodged a complaint with the ECI, accusing him of not showing his vote to his party polling agent, BSP legislative party leader  .
 
 
 The complaint against Singh—SP lodged a similar complaint against its defecting MLA Nitin Agarwal-—led to delay in counting of votes. Singh, however, maintained that he did show his vote to Verma.
 
 
 Singh is learnt to be in touch with a senior BJP leader from Unnao. Sources said the BSP leadership was aware of Singh’s growing bonhomie with the BJP.
