 Pune: Pet lovers will have to abide by some rules if the civic body’s proposed policy for keeping animals at home becomes a reality. 
 
 The women and child welfare committee of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has its nod to draft the policy, but a section of the BJP leadership is not in favour of its implementation. 
 
 “We don’t want to discourage people from keeping pet dogs or cats. The aim of the policy is to streamline these activities,” said Rani Bhosale, chairperson of the committee.
 
 “The policy will ensure that proper care is taken of the animals. It will create awareness about good practices to be followed while keeping a pet dog or cat at home,” said Vaishali Jadhav, assistant medical officer of PMC. 
 
 “Animal lovers may take the policy as infringement of their personal rights. Some may not like restricting the number of animals at their homesWe will request the committee to scrap the proposal,” said Shreenath Bhimale, leader of the house.
