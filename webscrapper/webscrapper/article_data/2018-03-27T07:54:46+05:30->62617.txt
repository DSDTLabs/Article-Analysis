AHMEDABAD: Chief minister   has asked parents of school-going children to remain patient saying that the government was intent on giving them justice.

 Speaking to mediapersons,   said, “The government is committed to having the fee regulation law implemented and it advises parents to remain patient as once the apex court decides on the matter, the government will ensure that the excess fee charged by schools will refunded.”
 
 Rupani said the high court has upheld the fee regulation law and the apex court has also asked school managements to approach the fee regulatory committees. A time frame has been fixed and schools seeking higher fees than set by the government will have to approach the committee. Rupani said colleges can charge any fees at present but the final decision on fees for schools will be fixed by the committee formed under the Act.
