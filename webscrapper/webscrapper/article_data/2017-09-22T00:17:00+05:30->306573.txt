Tirupur: While the admissions under RTE Act will come to an end on September 25, 417 out of 2,452 seats in private schools in Tirupur district are yet to be filled. 

 However, the Inspectorate of Matriculation Schools is confident that it could achieve better per centage than the last year’s 92%. As per the RTE Act, 25% of total students’ strength in the private schools should be allotted to the children coming from poor economic conditions, and they should be provided the education on par with that given to the fortunate children. The government will reimburse the cost incurred for such service to the schools.
 
 “We have witnessed that the awareness about the scheme has been increased among the people,” said P Shantha, Inspector of Matriculation Schools (IMS), Erode region. For the first time, the admission process was made online, for which, the interested parents should submit the documents including birth certificate of their children, ration card, community certificate and their family income certificate. All these documents are mandatory; otherwise, the admission cannot be done.
 
 “Since Tirupur district has more migratory population, many parents have not transferred their ration card or have not possessed other needed certificates. Only sometimes, the system accepted the other district ration cards. Many of them were not promptly responded to submit the certificates, it became hurdle for their children’s admission,” mentioned Shantha. 
 
 “But still, 83% of the seats in 149 private schools in the district have been filled, we expect that more than 300 out of 417 non-filled seats to be filled within next four days,” said C Maharajan, Deputy IMS.
