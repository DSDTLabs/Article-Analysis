NOIDA: Two women, one Hindu and the other a Muslim, saved the lives of their husbands by donating their kidneys to the other’s partners at a city hospital.

 Though the women were ready to donate their kidneys to their respective husbands, fate did not allow that to happen as their blood groups did not match that of their husbands.
 
 Ekram (29) of Greater Noida and Baghpat’s Rahul Varisht (26) were diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease by a private hospital in Sector 126. A   was recommended to both the men by the doctors.
 
 However, both men had no donors other than their wives — Razia (24) and Pavitra (38) — but their blood groups failed to match that of their husbands.
 
 In a pleasant twist of fate, Ekram’s wife Razia’s   (B+) matched Rahul’s while Rahul’s wife Pavitra’s blood group (A+) matched Ekram’s.
 
 “Separate meetings with both families were held and they were told that if each woman donates her kidney to the other’s husband, it is possible to save the lives of both patients. The   process was explained to their families. Convinced, each woman agreed to donate a kidney to the other’s husband,” a statement from the hospital said on Monday.
 
 A five-hour surgery conducted on May 4 successfully transplanted the kidneys to both patients. Both Ekram and Rahul have been discharged and visit the hospital for follow-ups.
