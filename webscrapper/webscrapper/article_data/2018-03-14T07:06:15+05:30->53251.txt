NEW DELHI: Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) chairman   has said that attempts are being made to “discredit” the regulator through “repeated allegations” of bias, levelled by a section of the industry, which have hurt him and his officials deeply. “It certainly hurts one… it hurts, hurts all of us in   when baseless allegations are levelled against us,” Sharma, in the eye of a storm over a new tariff order on predatory prices, told TOI.

 
 Industry lobby body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has made repeated allegations of bias against Trai since the launch of services by Reliance Jio.   has alleged that Trai’s orders and regulations favour the new operator, while causing losses to older companies such as Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular.
 
 Sharma said regulations are arrived at only after wide-ranging consultations with all stakeholders, and thus there is “no question” of according favour to any particular operator.
 
 “Criticism of decision-making is one part, but allegations of bias and other such things are really uncalled for. Trai passes an order or a regulation as per the Trai Act and these are appealable. If someone is aggrieved by these orders, the appropriate course of action is to go to a court of law rather than discredit Trai.”
 
 He said decisions taken by Trai are transparent. “My job is to do my duty in a consultative, transparent, non-discriminatory and unbiased manner.”
 
 Trai had recently passed a new tariff order that also dealt with predatory tariffs. This was objected to by COAI, and even saw criticism from Vodafone’s global CEO Vittorio Colao and Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal.
 
 Sharma said the criticism does not impact Trai’s working. “I am not hampered. We will continue to discharge our functions in a fair, transparent, and consultative manner. The criticism is not going not deter us.”
