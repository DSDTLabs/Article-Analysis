 During the protest they stated that implementation of direct benefit transfer (DBT) was supposed to benefit the scholars, however, after its implementation the delays in the disbursement of stipend have increased.
 “Forget about the monthly stipend, we don’t even get our contingency funds. We are not certain if we will get the money that we have put from our pockets for our research,” said Preetleen, a CSIR fellow in the department of chemistry at the  .
 
 
 “Before the implementation of the direct benefit transfer, the situation was better as the university would give us the grants in time and then the officials concerned used to deal with the funding agencies directly.
 
 
 “The idea behind the implementation of the DBT was that the funds should reach the research fellows in time. On the contrary, the DBT has only increased problems,” she added.
