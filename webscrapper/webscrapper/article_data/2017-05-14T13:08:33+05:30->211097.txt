PUNE:   on Saturday said the city would not face water cuts this summer. 

 The four dams that cater to the city's water needs have enough stock to meet Pune's requirements till July 15. "So there is no plan to impose water cuts," he said. 
 
 He appealed to the citizens to use water judiciously and avoid wastage.
 
 "I spoke to officials of the   and irrigation department over the last few days in detail about the water stock in dams. After reviewing the situation, we concluded that there is no need for water cuts in the city as of now. Barring a few occasions, when the civic administration announces water cuts for repairs and maintenance works, supply will continue as per the existing schedule till July 15," Bapat said.
 
 He added that various agencies have predicted normal and timely rainfall this year, which is a good sign.
 
 Meanwhile, Bapat said the ongoing water rotation from   for rural parts will continue for a few more days. About 3TMC water is being released during the rotation.
 
 Water stock will be kept reserved to meet drinking needs once the rotation is stopped. Strict instructions were issued to irrigation officials and MSEDCL to monitor the flow of water to canals and initiate action against water theft and illegal lifting, he said. 
 
 Bapat claimed that water supply for the city, farms and rural parts has been managed well for the last year. A meeting will be called during the monsoon season to chalk out a plan for next year's release of water, he said. 
 
 Bapat also said the state government is working on a proposal to streamline the allocation of funds for repairs of canals and stop wastage by allowing the irrigation offices to make use of the water tax they have collected from stakeholders.
