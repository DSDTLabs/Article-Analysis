NEW DELHI: Unless the adjoining areas of the National Capital Region ( ) are developed and some of the city's infrastructure not shifted there, Delhi will never shine, Delhi high court said on Wednesday. 

 The high court said rampant illegal construction have put severe pressure on the limited infrastructure and resources of Delhi, including water and electricity, and hence it needs to expand beyond its limited boundaries.
 
 "There was a policy in place with regard to development of the NCR which envisaged expansion of Delhi beyond its boundaries," observed a bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice  .
 
 It said that the NCR Planning Board Act provided for evolving harmonised policies for the control of land-use and development of infrastructure in the national capital, so as to avoid any haphazard development of the region.
 
 The court asked the authorities to think about expansion and shifting of some infrastructure out of Delhi to decongest the city.
 
 "We want to see Delhi shining as it is the heart of the country," the bench observed.
 
 The bench's oral observations were made during the hearing of a plea by a Delhi resident who urged the court to direct the   to reserve seats in their colleges for the students of Delhi.
 
 Taking note of this, the bench issued notice to the Centre, the Delhi government and Delhi University asking them to respond.
