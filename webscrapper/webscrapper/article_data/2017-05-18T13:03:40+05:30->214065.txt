MEERUT: Scores of students of Sir   (SCRIET) protested outside the college after authorities refused over 200 of them to sit for their exam over delay in scholarship money on Wednesday afternoon.

  “Since the future of hundreds of students was at stake, all the students of B.Tech – even those who were allowed to sit for exam – sat on protest outside the college. According to rules, students cannot be debarred from siting for exams if the scholarship money does not arrive and this is why everybody skipped exam,” said Rajdeep Vikkal, president for   unit of  .
  
  The students, however, have been protesting for a long time now to raise an alarm regarding this matter but all they got so far was assurance from the Samaj Kalyan department, which is responsible for the scholarship amount.
  
  It was only after over two hours of protest that the university administration agreed to allow the students to give exam. While Wednesday’s exam has been rescheduled, all students will be allowed to sit for other exams.
  
   , director of SCRIET, said, “The exam scheduled for Wednesday has been rescheduled for everybody and now, all the students will be allowed to sit for the exams, irrespective of the fact whether we have received their scholarship amount or not.”
