Chennai: Car market leader Maruti Suzuki is betting big on the two-pedal technology and plans to offer variations of the technology across its entire model range. The company — whose two-pedal technologies include AGS (auto gear shift), CVT (continuously variable transmission) and AT (automatic transmission) — is targeting sales of 3,00,000 units from this technology by 2020. 

 Maruti expects to nearly double its two-pedal technology model sales from 79,000 units in FY-16-17 to 1,50,000 units in FY17-18, said company officials.
 
 “Going forward, Maruti’s endeavour is to bring one of the two-pedal technologies to its models, across segments in some form, either auto gear shift, CVT or AT,” Maruti’s executive director R&D, C V Raman said. The car maker has been offering at least one of the three versions of the two-pedal technology in each of its new launches with both Ignis and the Dzire upgrade offering AGS options in both petrol and diesel and Baleno offering CVT.
 
 Maruti’s two pedal volumes have grown from 30,000 units in FY 14-15 to 54,000 units in FY 15-16 to 79,000 units in FY 2016-17. In Maruti’s current portfolio, the two pedal technologies include AGS in Celerio, Wagon R, Alto K-10, Ignis and the new DZire, CVT in Baleno and AT in DZire and Ertiga. In models where two-pedal options are available, the technology’s share has grown from 5% in FY14-15 to 11% in FY16-17 as Maruti offers one of the three two-pedal versions on more models.
 
 Given its affordability and the fact that it compares well with manual transmission on mileage, AGS is the most popular option of the three versions. 
 
 “Our experience on AGS has been quite positive,” said a company spokesperson. “It accounts for over 40% sales in Celerio, Wagon R 13 %, Alto 15%, Ignis 26%. Besides, of the total two pedal technology sold in India, 54 % comes from AGS. However, in some models the CVT works better as in Baleno while in others AT works better like Ertiga and Ciaz.”
 
 Top ten markets alone contribute 44 % of the two pedal technology sales industry wide making it a strictly urban phenomenon for now. So Maruti’s effort will be to ‘democratise’ these technologies. “With enhanced awareness we expect more first time buyers and rural penetration,” said the Maruti spokesperson.
 
 In February 2014, Maruti introduced AGS with the Celerio hatchback.
 
  Till date Celerio AMT vehicles contribute over 60% to total Celerio sales.
