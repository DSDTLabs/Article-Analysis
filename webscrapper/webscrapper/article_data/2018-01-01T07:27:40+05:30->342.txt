KOLKATA: 2017 has seen the least amount of   in the last three decades.

 
 With 328 reported road accident deaths in 2017 till now, the fatal accident figures are way below the average 448.1 deaths reported every year since 1989. In 2010, road accident death figure stood at 354 in Kolkata. This was so far the lowest figure since 1989.
 
 While the numbers have shown a steady decline since 2012, when 498 deaths were reported (2014 being the only aberration when 450 deaths were reported), the 2017 death figures show the sharpest decline of nearly 27% compared to average road accident deaths per year.
 
 Kolkata Police, since March 2017, has been manning 300 square kilometres, 57 square kilometres more than what it did earlier. Three major moves to curb errant driving — the Safe Drive Save Life (SDSL) campaign, steep hike in traffic penalties and the aggressive introduction of modern gadgets — are behind the sharp decline. While the   was started in 2016, the other measures were introduced in August 2017.
 
 Transport minister   said, “The   campaign, monitored periodically by the chief minister herself, had several impacts. It has led to a better coordination between the Kolkata traffic police and the state transport department. With the chief minister at the helm, we were able to introduce several other measures. Kolkata Police made the effort and the transport department backed them up.” In 2017, the Kolkata Police was also given a Rs 12-crore grant to procure state-of-the-art equipment like speed guns.
 
 Police commissioner   largely attributed the sharp decline in fatal accidents to awareness. The awareness, he said, was also evident among motorists. The fatal accident data also indicates that the 1998-2007 phase reported the highest fatal accidents per year at 455.2 deaths every year.
 
 Kolkata Police till 2010 manned 108 square kilometres. This was later increased to 243 square kilometres. In March 2017, it was increased to 300 square kilometres.
