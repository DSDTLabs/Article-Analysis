To find a producer for your debut project is every filmmaker’s biggest challenge. And when actor   decided to don the director’s hat, it was his concern, too. 
However, Harsh, who is set to make his directorial debut with ' ', admits that he has been rather fortunate in this regard. He says, “Rarely do we find producers who say, ‘Stars nahi, achhi script chahiye’. Luckily, I found such producers; to get a big star was not their priority, they wanted good content. I was given the liberty to cast the actors, who I felt suited the role. Who gives so much liberty to a first-time director these days? Any good script deserves producers like these.”
 
 The film, also written by Harsh, is a comedy that revolves around death. Its music is being released on Zee Music. Producer Amrit Sethia says, “We at   have partnered with S.O.I.E to bring the best of entertainment and content to the market. We have a pact for 10 movies with them, starting with this one. Whoever has a good script can approach us for their next. We want to create projects for viewers, who believe that content is the soul of a film.”
 
 'Khajoor Pe Atke', produced by Welcome Friends Productions, presented by S.O.I.E and distributed by PVR Pictures, releases on May 18.
