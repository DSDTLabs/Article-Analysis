KOLKATA: A day after the police questioned a businessman at   for allegedly hitting his neighbour with a stick because the latter’s dog was “barking too much,” a local court has sent him to judicial custody till January 25. Police, though, clarified on Saturday that the attack was for a “trivial reason” and “no other motive have been established so far”. The homicide section also said the probe so far has not established any other personal or business rivalry. 

 Police said accused Avijit Sen — a businessman running a private security agency who was earlier questioned in the   murder case by CBI — was arrested from his house on the basis of the complaint lodged by his neighbour Mukund Khaitan. Sen has been booked under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder). Sources said the sections might be changed before the chargesheet is submitted. 
 
 “There is a chance that IPC Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) might be slapped,” said an officer.
 
 Khaitan’s residence is at 4 Queens Park, next to the accused’s house. Khaitan’s complaint said Sen had come out of his house on Thursday afternoon with a small iron rod and protested against Khatan’s dog barking inside the house. During the argument, Sen reportedly hit him on the head with the rod, which cops have subsequently seized. “It has a spring system whereby it opens up when given a push,” said an officer.
 
 Sen’s counsel said that the accused didn’t hit Khaitan on the head. Instead, he fell and hurt himself during a scuffle between them, which was unintentional.
