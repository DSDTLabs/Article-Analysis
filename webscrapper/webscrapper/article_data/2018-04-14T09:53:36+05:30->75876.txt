ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court severely reprimanded the Uttar Pradesh government on Friday on the Unnao rape case. 

  Several hours before the main accused,  's Bangarmau MLA  , was held by the   in the evening, the HC questioned the UP advocate general for the delay in his arrest. It directed CBI to carry out the investigations strictly in accordance with law and file a status report by May 2 . 
 
  
  
  The court gave the direction to CBI after state government's counsel informed it that Sengar had been detained for interrogation and not arrested yet . 
 
  Severely criticising the government for its functioning, a bench comprising Chief Justice Dilip Babasaheb Bhosale and Justice   observed: "The disturbing feature of the case is that the law and order machinery and the government officials were directly in league (with) and under the influence of Kuldeep Singh Sengar. The doctor did not examine the prosecutrix, nor did the circle officer, Shafipur, register the crime, though hand written complaint of the prosecutrix was sent from the office of the chief minister." 
 
  The court rejected the advocate general's contention that the accused could not be arrested in the present circumstances. "In our opinion, arrest of the accused in the present case is necessarily required to safeguard the majesty of law and the dignity of the prosecutrix and to instil confidence that free and fair investigation shall be undertaken by the investigating agency," the court said.
