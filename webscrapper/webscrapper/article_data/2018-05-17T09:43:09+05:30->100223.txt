 The Street was gripped in negative sentiment in the last couple of sessions after it seemed that the   will not be able to form its government in Karnataka. However, with   swearing in as the Chief Minister of the state, investors are hoping that the stock market will gain some steam.
 
 All sectoral sub-indices with the exception of Nifty Metal, which was down more than half a per cent, were in the green.
 
 Coal India, PowerGrid and   were the major gainers while Tata Steel, Adani Ports and Yes Bank were losing the most.
