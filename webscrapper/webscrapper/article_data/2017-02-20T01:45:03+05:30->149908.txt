Mumbai: While chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has expressed confidence that the BJP will cross the magic figure of 113 in the BMC, a senior cabinet member from his party told TOI that in the event the BJP is unable to secure a clear majority, it will not support the Shiv Sena in the race for the mayor’s post.

 He said if the BJP fails to secure a clear majority, it will not back the Sena’s bid to consolidate its position in the city civic corporation. “We will not support the Sena in the mayoral election. We will take a decision on whether to oppose Shiv Sena nominee for the mayor’s post or abstain from voting after results are declared,’’ he said.
 
 The statement is indicative of the friction that’s set in between the two parties which run a coalition government in Maharashtra. In the 288-member assembly, the BJP has 123 MLAs, 19 short of the number needed to prove a majority. The Shiv Sena with 63 legislators is its partner.
 
 When asked if the BJP’s latest stance would, in turn, jeopardise the stability of the regime since it relies on the Sena to prove a majority, he dismissed the possibility. 
 
 “If they withdraw support, we are prepared to face the situation…there is no threat to the government. We have a strength of 123 and, a few independents are supporting the BJP. If there is a floor test, we are sure a few legislators will cross over in favour of the BJP,’’ he said.
 
 If that formula does not work out, BJP will not hesitate to recommend President’s rule for a limited period, he said. “We are prepared for any eventuality to protect the government. If there is President’s rule, we will explore the possibility of engineering a split in one or the other party to mobilise support,’’ he said.
