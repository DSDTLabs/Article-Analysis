HYDERABAD: Residents and commuters passing by Autonagar dump complain of   and fear diseases.

 Carcasses being dumped at Autonagar dump yard has been   for decades. “We are unable to bear the stench emanating from the dump. Autonagar is no more an abandoned place on the outskirts. It is now home to government employees, techies and engineering students, whose colleges are located in Ibrahimpatnam,” Anil Goud M, a resident of LB Nagar, said.
 
 
 A senior citizen, who was passing through that area, said the dump might cause air-borne and vector-borne diseases.
 
 A woman, requesting anonymity, said, “We purchased our house far away from the city for a   and clean air, but our purpose was defeated.”
 
 Autonagar dump, spread over 40 acres, was a major dumping ground before Jawaharnagar was identified as a garbage dump. At the dump yard, a part of the premises was marked as carcass utilisation centre. After the Jawaharnagar dump yard was set up, instructions were issued to dump all garbage generated in the city at the yard, but carcasses till date were being sent to Autonagar.
