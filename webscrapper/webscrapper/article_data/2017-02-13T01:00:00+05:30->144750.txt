 The director shares his experience of putting the cast together
 
 We needed a star. Arbaaz has a soothing persona with romantic and gentlemanly attributes. We needed someone who seems drastically different from Ashutosh Rana’s character in the film.
 
 
 Every story involves a strong female character. It was challenging to find someone who could go from being the girl-next-door to a powerful lady. Manjari was promising in her audition.
 
 
 I wanted a younger, good-looking boy, who was known to the youth so they could relate with the depth of his character’s emotions. Himansh fit the bill. 
 
 
 It was difficult to cast this character. Ashutosh turned out to be a gem and is powerful on screen.

 'Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai', produced by Bibia Films, releases on March 3, 2017.
