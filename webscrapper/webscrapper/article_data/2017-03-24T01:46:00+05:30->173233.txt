MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday directed the civic   to give comedian Kapil Sharma a personal hearing before deciding what action to take on a notice issued against alleged illegalities in a building where he has a large flat in a Mumbai suburb. 

 In partial relief for Sharma, the BMC informed the court that it has withdrawn a demolition notice which it had issued earlier in 2014 for the same construction.
 
 The BMC had in April 2016 issued a notice where it alleged unauthorized merger of the ninth floor and alleged illegal extensions in a building called DLH Enclave in Oshiwara where he has a flat. His counsel Pradeep Thorat and R A Thorat, counsel for developer Dev Land Housing, argued that despite an existing stay granted in 2014 to the demolition notice, the BMC was seeking fresh action that was improper. 
 
 The HC had last October stayed the   Regional Town Planning (MRTP) Act notice and the stay continues.
 
 The withdrawal by BMC of its demolition notice under Section 351 of the BMC Act meant that the litigation pending before the city civil court, which had stayed the demolition notice, stands abated. The civic counsel said, however, another notice under Section 53 of the MRTP Act remains pending. 
 
 The MRTP Act provision empowers the civic authority to deal with unauthorized development and ensure its removal. It is a stricter provision, which also stipulates imprisonment of up to six months and fine for violations, if a person is found guilty. A bench of Justice NH Patil and Justice MS Karnik directed the BMC to take a decision on that notice after allowing Sharma three weeks to give his written reply to the BMC. 
 
 Should Kapil seek a personal hearing, the court said the BMC should give him one. It then disposed of the petition Sharma had filed last year to challenge the notice.
