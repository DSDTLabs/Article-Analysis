THANE: The sessions court on Thursday sentenced two youths to 20 years of rigorous   for the gang   of a young married woman in   a year ago. Session judge S C Khalipe also imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 each on the two convicts.

 The prosecution informed the court that the victim and the accused were residents of the same locality in Mahatma Phule Nagar and knew each other. They said in court that on the night of May 23, 2016, the 24-year-old victim was sleeping at home along with her two children when the two entered her residence and gang-raped her.
 
 Around 1.15 am the duo broke into the sleeping victim’s home, pulled out a knife, and assaulted and raped her. “The duo issued threats that if she resisted then they would slit her throat and also kill her two children sleeping with her,” the prosecutor said in court. Condoms and the knife used to threaten the woman were found at the crime spot. 
 
 The judge in her order noted: “The court is of the view that the accused are in jail, therefore they are sentenced to fine for minimum amount and that fine amount is liable to be given to the victim as compensation. The court is of the view that amount is inadequate for granting compensation to the victim, therefore I suggest the district legal services authority to grant the compensation to the victim under the scheme of Section 357(A) of the CrPC.”
