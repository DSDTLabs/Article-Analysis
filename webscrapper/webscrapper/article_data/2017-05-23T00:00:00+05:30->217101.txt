Cinematographer-turned-filmmaker   has roped in a stellar cast for Tovino Thomas’ upcoming Malayalam-Tamil bilingual, which is yet to be titled. We recently got to know that the movie has   playing the female protagonist while  ,   and   too are part of the cast of the love story.
 
 The film would be Tovino’s debut in Tamil and the actor tells us, “It’s my first full-length role as a romantic hero. I play a software engineer named Abi in the movie. His parents are a wealthy business couple, who are constantly travelling. So, Suhasini ma’am’s and Prabhu sir’s characters, who are his neighbours in Chennai, serve as his second parents.”
  
 The movie would also mark a comeback of sorts for Pia Bajpai in the South film industry as she was last seen in Mollywood and Kollywood in 2013 in the films Aamayum Muyalum and Nerungi Vaa Muthamidathe, respectively.
  
 Pia though refuses to term it a comeback. “I was always here. It’s just that I am choosy and for me to sign a project, I should get some kick out of it especially because I do not know the languages and have to put in more work,” she says. “Plus, good films take time to come.”
  
 The actress plays Anu, a young organic farmer who is raised by a single mother essayed by Rohini in the film. “My character is socially aware and she also has a blog where she expresses her views. So, she’s very much a today’s girl and film tells a trendy love story of the contemporary youth,” Pia explains.
 
 We also got to know that ace cinematographer Santhosh Sivan is serving as the executive producer for the movie. On joining the crew of the movie, he says, “It’s based on the article in a newspaper and I found it very interesting. Plus, it’s got a corporate house backing the movie as well as Vijayalakshmi helming it, so I am glad to be part of the movie.”
  
 The film was shot extensively in Vagamon, Chalakudy, Erattupeta and Chennai, and is currently in the final stages of post-production.
