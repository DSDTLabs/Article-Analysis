AURANGABAD: While the   has made   (17614) six-days week train, demand for increasing frequency of Nanded-Pune Express (12730) that runs via Aurangabad has been pressed by passengers and activists. 

 The Nanded-Pune Express via Aurangabad and Manmad presently runs on every Monday and Wednesday. 
 
 The demand for revising timing of the train has been also raised by passengers boarding at Aurangabad as the train reaches to the city post midnight.
 
 "Effective train connectivity between Aurangabad and Pune has been an issue for long, despite strong demand from passengers. While frequency of Nanded - Pune Express running via Latur has been increased, similar measure should be taken for Nanded-Pune Express passing from Aurangabad," said Mangesh Rajhans, an IT professional who often commutes between Aurangabad and Pune.
 
 Railway activist Raj Somani said railway authorities should rigorously follow the demand concerned at the highest level. 
 
 "Besides hourly State transportation buses that run towards Pune from Aurangabad , a very large number of private buses ply every night between these two metro cities. It only substantiates demand for increased rail connectivity, " he said. 
 
 Divisional Railway manager for Nanded division of the South central railway could not be reached for comments.
 
 Other senior railway officials passed on blame to South central railway for poor connectivity between Aurangabad and Pune.
 
 " The south central railway is ready for pressing more trains into service between two cities, but the Central railway authorities are reluctant for such proposals saying that saturation has reached on concerned routes," a senior official said, preferring anonymity.
 
 The central railway officials could not be reached for their version.
