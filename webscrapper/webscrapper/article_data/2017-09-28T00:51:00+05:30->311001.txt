Ramanathapuram: A couple of archaeology enthusiasts stumbled upon a neolithic axe (celt) at Bogalur village – 15km away from Ramanathapuram town. Having found numerous archaeological evidences in the village like pot shreds, grinding stones, slings and iron ore residues, the enthusiasts appealed to the archaeology department to undertake a proper exploration study in the village.

 School teachers, Gandhi and Boominathan found hundreds of pot shreds strewn across 40 acres near Mullaikottai Muniswarar temple in the village. Growing curious, they informed Ramanathapuram Archaeological Foundation in this regard. Based on their information, president of the foundation, V Rajaguru and secretary, S Gnanakalimuthu along with a PhD scholar in archaeology, Hari Gopalakrishnan inspected the area recently unearthing the neolithic axe. Rajaguru said the Mullakottai Muniswarar temple is 2km away from Vaigai river on the banks of a stream called Kathanodai. Probing the area, they spotted this neolithic tool made with granite stone with dimensions of 7cm length and 5.5cm breadth. The stone is finely polished and should have been attached with a wooden handle. “We feel that it could be at least 5,000 years old and belongs to the neolithic period,” he said. The members of foundation feel that there are not many archaeological evidences from that period found in Tamil Nadu. Not just this axe, there are grinding stones, sling stones, graffiti marked pot shreds, black and red colour pot shreds, broken terracotta materials like handles, iron slags and iron ore residues along the temple area. 
 
 It is intriguing that both neolithic evidences and iron materials are found in the same place suggesting that there could have been a human settlement starting from neolithic age to Sangam era for thousands of years. “This is first time we are finding a neolithic tool in Ramanathapuram district. It will be worth an exploration,” Rajaguru added.
