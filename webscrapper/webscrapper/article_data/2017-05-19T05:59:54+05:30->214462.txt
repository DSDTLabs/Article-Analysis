INDORE: After students and parents got confused over  's results announcement, the   For Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) released a circular that said dates for results will be announced two days in advance of its release. 

 The board also clarified that rumours must not be believed.
 
 A statement put out on the council website said, "Forty-eight hours prior to declaration of ICSE and   2017 Examination Results, a notification regarding the same will be put up on the Council's website www.cisce.org."
 
 Parents and students panicked after some social media reports claimed that the results for ICSE would be announced at 11 am on Monday.
 
 Some websites also claimed that the results would be available by 3 pm. The panic resulted in a lot of calls to school principals and teachers as well.
 
 "It is always better to declare the date of the result a few days before the announcement and that students are prepared by the announcement day," said  , a parent of an ICSE student from the city.
 
 Last year, the ICSE and ISC results were announced on May 6, which was earlier than previous years. However, exams this year were delayed due to elections in several states.
