AMRITSAR: The jathedar of Akal  , the supreme temporal body of the Sikhs, has demanded “exemplary punishment” for the owners of the factory from which molasses leaked into the Beas river on May 17, leading to the death of thousands of fish.

  Giani Gurbachan Singh said on Sunday that the accidental leak had endangered aquatic life in the Beas. Though he did not take names, the jathedar said several factory and mill owners in Punjab had poisoned river waters and posed a severe threat to animals, birds, aquatic species, and human beings. 
 
 “Farmers irrigate their fields with water from these rivers. These people are poisoning our food,” he said.
 
 An ‘accidental’ leak of molasses from Chadha Sugar Industries in Kiri Afghana village, Sri Hargobindpur in Gurdaspur district, left a large number of fish dead.
 
 According to sources, the mill owners have close relations with   leadership. “If   can be punished for poaching blackbucks, why not the owners of these factories?” asked Gurbachan, adding that the same water would eventually reach Rajasthan, where these deer would be drinking the same.
 
 Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chairman Kahan Singh Pannu said he had marked an inquiry and would act once they had received the report.
 
 State environment minister OP   claimed that there was no political pressure on him. “Any hue and cry in this regard is fake. Experts are preparing the report; it will take some time,” he said, adding that personal relations wouldn’t hinder the course of law. 
 
 He said all the industrialists and traders were like his friends and brothers, but the law was same for all and there would be no relaxation for offenders.
