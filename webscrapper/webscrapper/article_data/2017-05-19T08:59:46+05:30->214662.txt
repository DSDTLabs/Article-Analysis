CHENNAI: With the election commission's deadline to submit affidavits in the two-leaves symbol case nearing, former CM-turned-rebel leader   is expected to meet Prime Minister   on Friday. The meeting is scheduled to take place at Modi's residence in the evening, sources said.

 The meeting assumes significance against the backdrop of the NDA government and the   regime redefining their relationship in the run-up to the Presidential polls. The much-hyped merger talks too have not taken place yet, with the leaders of both factions taking tough stands.
 
 “His request for an appointment with PM has been pending for some time,“ said a BJP source. The OPS faction remains firm on its pre-conditions for merger ­ expel   and family members from the party and institute a CBI probe into  's death. During his meet with Modi, OPS is likely to extend support to BJP in the presidential polls.
