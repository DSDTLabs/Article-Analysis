NEW DELHI: A day after the high court directed the Centre to take an “in-principle decision” on the AAP government’s proposal to regularise unauthorised colonies, Delhi’s urban development minister,  , did not miss the opportunity to put the onus on the central government for delaying the process by raising repeated queries on the proposal. 

 The Delhi government wants the   ministry’s 2008 guidelines to be amended to enable regularisation of these colonies, including the upscale  , on an “as is where is basis.” 
 
 On Thursday, Jain said, “All political parties are on the same page that the 1,639 colonies need to be regularised, but why is the delay on the part of the Centre? The Centre wants more details on our proposal to legalise these colonies, leading to the delay. The Delhi government has provided all details available with it.” The Delhi government has conceded that the colonies can’t be regularised within the existing framework of the 2008 guidelines that have been amended from time to time. 
 
 The former Congress government under  , too, in its last term demanded the same but the UPA government at the Centre did not agree to its proposal to relax the guidelines that clearly lay down covered area parameters and development-charge criteria. 
 
 The number of unauthorised colonies under scrutiny since 2008 add up to around 1,640. The AAP-led government wants amendments in the variable structure of payment of development charges for different colonies depending on their socio-economic profile. Both the Centre—during the President’s rule in Delhi—and the AAP government gradually increased the cutoff date for including the colonies and it now stands at January 1, 2015. 
 
 The Delhi high court has given the central government four weeks to take a decision. “The AAP government demands that the Centre gives in-principle agreement and thereafter, the city administration will distribute the certificates within 24 hours,” Jain said.
