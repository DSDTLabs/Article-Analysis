JAIPUR: The announcement of long-pending forester and forest guards’ recruitment would have brought cheer to many.

 In the forthcoming financial year, 500 foresters and 2,000 forest guards that are the base of the forest department pyramid would be recruited.
 
 But setting aside Rs 100 crore for establishing CETPs in the industrial areas is a significant move as it would take care of industrial units polluting several rivers and water-bodies in the state. For the same the contribution of the   and RIICO would be in the ratio of 50:50. Add to that to check effluent discharge in industrial areas, ‘Pollution Control management Systems’ based on   (SCADA) would be implemented.
 
 Add to that Rs 151 crore have been set aside for 22,700 hectares in 17 districts for water conservation and forestry purposes. This would be done under the project for development of water catchment through Greening of Rajasthan. In order to check air pollution, 26 districts of the state would be equipped with Continous Ambient Air Quality monitoring Stations at the cost of Rs 60 crore. So far only 10 such stations in seven districts were functional.
