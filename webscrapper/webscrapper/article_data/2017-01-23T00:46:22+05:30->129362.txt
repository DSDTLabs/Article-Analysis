NEW DELHI: The high court wants to study a CAG audit report of a central government-sponsored organisation that runs creches for the children of mothers working in the unorganised sector.

 Justice   has asked the Centre for the CAG audit report of Indian Council for   ( ) that faces allegations of misappropriation of funds meant for running creches.
 
 The high court’s directions came while hearing ICCW’s plea for reimbursement of the money spent, in the absence of funds from the government, on salary of its employees and getting medicines and food for children in the creches till December 31 last year.
 
 ICCW, in its plea, sought the release of funds sanctioned for implementation of the Rajiv Gandhi National   Scheme under which it claims to run more than 5000 day-care centres for kids of mothers working in the unorganised sector in rural and urban areas.
 
 The court also recalled its December 30, 2016 order keeping in abeyance a letter of the Centre that allowed the state governments to take over running of the creches. On the issue of the reimbursement of claims made by the state councils of ICCW, the court said a committee appointed by it in March 2016 will examine the documents and decide the claims state-wise as there were over 5,000 creches across the country.
 
 The committee has been asked to take a decision within three weeks and place its report before the court. The court-appointed panel has also been asked to give a report after examining the claim of expenditure incurred by the state units of ICCW as well as the local creches under it.
 
 The ministry of woman and child development informed the court that the government will not release any funds without first scrutinising the expenditures claimed to have incurred by the council.
