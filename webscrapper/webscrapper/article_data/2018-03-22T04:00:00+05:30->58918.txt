Chennai: Investors have alleged that the Indian real estate partners of the US President’s The Trump Organisation have committed a fraud they estimated at between $150 million and $200 million.

 The investors, who first made the charges earlier this month, said the partners in Donald Trump’s business, including Lalit Goyal, Anurag Bhargava and others, had illegally siphoned off their money.
 
 “Indian [real estate firm] IREO ran a real estate scam that cheated investors of nearly $150 million,” said a complaint by the investors.
 
 IREO former CEO Ramesh Sanka witnessed cheating, fraud and misappropriation of money in the company where he had been employed, all of which resulted in wrongful gain for IREO managing director Lalit Goyal and his associates.
 
 In 2016, two real estate deals were signed for construction of an office tower in Gurgaon, outside New Delhi — one for 78 acres in the small town of Bhiwadi, and another for 37 acres in Gurgaon.
 
 Sanka quit the firm that year as he had been “increasingly uncomfortable with the way in which IREO’s business was being conducted” — a complaint to the Delhi police said. International investors, the UK-based Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and US-based Axon partners, filed the complaints.
 
 Since 2016, the US President’s son, Donald Trump Jr, had expressed enthusiasm about working with IREO. As per its franchise licensing agreement, the Indian business partners would build the property for Trump Organization.
 
 Axon and Children’s Investment Fund Foundation said in their complaint: “The Bhiwadi deal was a sham planned by Lalit Goyal in conspiracy with various other accused to misappropriate about $62 million.”
 
 This March another letter from Axon states that “they have evidence of diversion of funds” to the tune of nearly $150 million.
 
 The Trump Organization, IREO, Axon and Children’s Investment Fund could not be reached for comment.
