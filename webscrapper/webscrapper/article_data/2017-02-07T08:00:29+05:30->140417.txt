LUCKNOW: Unfazed by the   which clearly states in its   in the first phase of Assembly elections that   has fielded maximum number of candidates with criminal record, the party has added one more name to the list.

 Muscleman-turned-MLA from Sakaldiha and Dhanapur before delimitation, Sushil Singh, who is also the nephew of mafia-don-turned-MLC Brijesh Singh, has got BJP ticket from Saiyadraja seat in   Lok Sabha constituency. 
 
 Before delimitation, he was a BSP MLA from Dhanapur constituency. 
 
 Sushil’s getting a BJP ticket was expected as the Independent MLA had joined the party a few months back. 
 
 Singh, who as per his 2012 assembly poll affidavit, was accused of murders and extortion, would be pitted against another strongman of the region and BSP candidate Vineet Singh. Interestingly, in 2012, Sushil’s jailed uncle and mafia   Brijesh Singh had unsuccessfully contested from the same seat and lost to his closest rival and Independent candidate Manoj Kumar by about 2,000 votes. 
 
 Along with Sushil, the BJP also declared names of eight others as party candidates. 
 
 Shobha Singh, wife of late Munna Singh Chauhan, who was the state president of Rashtriya Lok Dal, has been given ticket from Bikapur constituency. Shobha had joined the BJP a few months back. 
 
 The party has fielded Anand Shukla from Ballia city, Surendra Singh from Bairia, Sadhna Singh from Mughalsarai, Suryabhan Tiwari from Sakaldiha, Ravindra Tiwari from Bhadohi, Mahendra Bind from Gyanpur and Ramashanker Patel from Marihan.
