The otherwise quaint  , a village located on the banks of Cauvery River in   district, is abuzz with birds and birdwatchers between March and June. Every year, nature photographers from different parts of India and across the world, together with wildlife enthusiasts and other tourists, flock to this little birds’ paradise to capture and document the best glimpses of this beautiful blue-tailed   that, as the name suggests, often feed on dragon flies and bees.

  Thought to migrate from North Pakistan and Himalayan region, these near-passerine land bird fly down to Naguvanahalli — situated about 3 kms from   — for breeding. To perch, they require small bushy plants with stalks and twigs. But too many people visiting the place during this season pose a threat to their breeding patterns.
 
  In a bid to counter this issue, former cricketer   took up the initiative to protect the species by laying out fence posts in their breeding area. The project has been put in place by the Forest Department; guards have also been put on duty to keep an eye on human activities in and around the area, so that the birds are not disturbed. This project is not only helps protect the birds, but also harnesses their nesting activities in the area.
