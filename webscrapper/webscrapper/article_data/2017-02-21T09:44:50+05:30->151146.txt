BARWANI: A private member bill, proposed by Congress MP  , to curb   expenses was recently in the limelight. The move might have evoked mixed responses from the public, but a Khargone-based couple managed to reflect the bill’s cause by saving precious time and money in planning their elder daughter’s wedding. They managed to do so by sending all the invitations for the marriage via   and  . 

 Rajendra Shrivastava, a steno for Khargone’s collector, told TOI that his wife  , who works as a clerk at the tribal welfare department, had no time to visit near and dear ones to invite them for the wedding. So they decided to send the invitations via whatsapp and facebook and later confirmed the occasion over telephone. They even prepared the invitation card and a minute and a half video which they shared on social media.
 
 Shrivastava said that he had earlier managed the marriages of his four sisters after the death of his father and knew the difficulties in arranging these functions.
 
 Their daughter Diwyani works as an assistant HR for a company in Pune and will tie the knot with a bank official, Lalit Medhe.
 
 Earlier,   Congress MP Ranjan had proposed the bill to cap wedding expenses. While introducing the bill he said that a marriage between two individuals is a solemn occasion but unfortunately it has turned into an event that is celebrated lavishly with a lot of money being spent on it. He said weddings have become events where people can show off their wealth and as a result, poor families are under tremendous social pressure to spend more. “This needs to be checked as it is not good for society as a whole,” Ranjan said.
