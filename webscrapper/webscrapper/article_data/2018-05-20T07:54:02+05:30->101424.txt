AHMEDABAD: A team of Gujarat police’s anti-terrorist squad ( ) apprehended Vinod and   — the promoters of Ahmedabad-based India Green Realty Pvt Ltd — and handed them over to CID (crime) for investigation. The   are wanted for an alleged   worth more than Rs 42 crore.

 
 ATS officials said a team received intelligence that the brothers were in Rajkot and apprehended them. They were handed over to CID late on Saturday night.
 
 CID officials had filed a complaint against the Thakar brothers; Amit Samanta, a resident of Kolkata; Aslam Afridi, a resident of Sarkhej; and others, for cheating investors. The complaint came after the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) pointed out possible malpractices by the firm.
 
 “The company, whose office is on the third floor of the Star Bazaar building near Jodhpur Crossroads, collected deposits in cash and by cheque from 2009 onwards, promising plots of land at   near Sanand. They had later proposed investments in the Dholera region as well,” said an officer investigating the case.
 
  According to the investigation, the accused duped investors of Rs 42 crore by taking their money but not providing documents or even the specifics of the properties in question,” said an investigator, adding that since 2009, the firm had shifted offices thrice.
 
 CID raided the company’s office on May 4 and seized financial documents. The Thakar brothers were then named absconders in the case.
