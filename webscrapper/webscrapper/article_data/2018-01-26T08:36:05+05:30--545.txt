CHANDIGARH:   was one of the main reasons behind the parents’ eagerness to get their daughters admitted in the one of the two most coveted girls’ schools.   and   till class XII were the other two reasons why the four missionary schools were preferred by the parents.

 Anu Goel, a Panchkula-based resident said, “I am glad my daughter made it in Sacred Heart School. This has been my priority not only because it is popular, but also because of the safety concerns.”
 “Keeping in view, the safety of girls in the society an all girl school is every parents’ dream. It is a cherry on top that these schools are among the most reputed ones,” said  , a resident of Sector 52.
 
 Parents also wanted these schools as they are now stressfree till their wards complete Class XII. “Most good schools are till Class X, and these schools are till Class XII,” said  , a Sector 21-based parent.
 
 Low fees too was the reason. Quality education at a reasonable price is what they expect from these schools.
