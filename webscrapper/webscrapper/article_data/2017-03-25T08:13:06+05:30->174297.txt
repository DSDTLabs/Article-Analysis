VIJAYAWADA: Tension prevailed in the city for some time as   fans went on the rampage at Annapurna talkies by breaking glass panes in protest against the theatre management for selling premier show tickets in black. 

 According to sources, theatre managements and exhibitors collected 500 per ticket for the  's much-awaited   benefit shows. 
 
 Fans shelled out everything in their pockets to watch the movie. Apsara, Annapurna, Inox and PVR theatres featuring the film displayed housefull boards. For people other than members of Pawan Kalyan's fan clubs, the pricey first day tickets were incredibly hard to find in the city. "We have been hunting for a ticket the whole night. It was futile. All we could do is listen to the whistles as the movie being streamed,"  , a BTech graduate said. 
 
 The first show eventually began at 6.30 am. "We did not mind purchasing two tickets for 1,100. The important aspect for us is to be among the handful of people who watch the movie's first show on the very first day," N Ram Prasad, a college student said.
