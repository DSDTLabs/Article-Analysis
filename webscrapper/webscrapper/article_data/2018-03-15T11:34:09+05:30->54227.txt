NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh chief minister   today alleged that   is using the same tactics he adopted in Tamil Nadu when he had supported the OPS faction against the EPS in the fued between the two factions of the AIADMK party, by pitting YSR's   and Jana Sena's   against him.
 
  
  
 "Instead of giving what AP people are rightfully asking, BJP is resorting to using Jagan Mohan Reddy and Pawan Kalyan against us...PM Modi is trying to repeat in Andhra Pradesh what he has done in Tamil Nadu," he said during a teleconference with his party MPs.
 
 The Andhra Pradesh chief minister, it appears, was referring to the 'role' played by BJP in the feud between O Panneerselvam and   factions in 2017 when the party had split into two parts following the death of its leader J Jayalalithaa.
 
 The TDP chief also asserted that there are strong anti-BJP and anti-Modi sentiment in the country and the results of yesterday's bypolls in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were a precursor of the things to come - a reference to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
 
 "There is strong anti-Modi and anti-BJP feeling across the country. Yesterdayâ€™s UP and Bihar by-poll results are an example of that," Naidu said.
 
 Yesterday, BJP lost both the Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh bypolls, including the Gorakhpur constituency, which was considered to be a stronghold of BJP, and also failed to wrest the two RJD's seats in Bihar.
 
 Earlier this month, Naidu snapped ties with the BJP-led NDA government in New Delhi after the Centre denied Naidu-led TDP's request for a special status for Andhra Pradesh.
