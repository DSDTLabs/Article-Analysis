THRISSUR:CPI state secretary   on Friday reminded   leaders not to score a ‘self-goal’ when the team   is playing a comfortable game which it is sure to win. The need of the hour is to fight for the emancipation of oppressed people and not to work for vote bank politics, he said.

 Kanam’s sharp comments on the future course of LDF was in reply to the outline presented by CPM politburo member S  , who argued for expanding the LDF by associating with parties which oppose communalism, neoliberalism and authoritarianism. “Our viewpoint is that LDF should be strengthened. The decision on whom all should be included needs to be taken by the front”, Pillai said while inaugurating the seminar ‘Kerala: Yesterday, today and tomorrow’ organized as part of CPM state conference.
 
 Though   didn’t mention Kerala Congress (M), all his arguments focused on why the LDF shouldn’t align with the party. He quoted a study by Kerala University politics department which said 77% of the people felt the previous UDF government was corrupt.
 
 “We need to introspect. What have we gained by going after vote bank politics. Where are dalits and downtrodden who had been with us? Now, they have joined some other camps and criticise us”, Kanam said.
 
 Arguing that it was important to create a feeling that the LDF can solve issues of the people rather than playing vote bank politics, Kanam said: “For some gains, discussing a political line which is against the interest of the LDF won’t do any good,” he concluded.
 
 K M Mani didn’t reply to the CPI leader’s remarks though he spoke after Kanam. Mani stressed on the need to develop a strategy to address job loss caused by the advent of artificial intelligence and to put in place systems to support farmers and Gulf returnees.
