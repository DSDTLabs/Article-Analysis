NAVI MUMBAI: The   after being crushed under a coconut tree in Chembur has led to an increase in residents demanding for   that have tilted because of strong winds and rains. 

 “The incident has caused panic amongst the residents. Since the unfortunate incident, I have received four requests to get trees cut in various locations,” said deputy municipal commissioner (garden) Tushar Pawar.
 
 A tilted coconut tree in the Vashi node has got the residents demanding action from the  . “It’s been a year that we are asking the garden department to cut the tree but there has been no response. Even now, no inspection has been done,” said Brian Fernandes, a local resident. 
 
 Civic officials reportedly said the tree was inside the compound of a private hospital and stayed away from trimming it down. 
 
 “I think the administration is waiting for a repeat of the Chembur incident. The roots are exposed and the tree is now tilting dangerously, yet it has not occurred to the department to get it cut,” Fernandes added. 
 
  “The civic body does little to give appropriate nourishment and space to the trees, resulting in more tree falls,” said activist Abaa Ranavare.
