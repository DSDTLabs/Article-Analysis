After two romantic flicks, namely Simpallag Ond Love Story and Simpallag Innondh Love Story, and a political flick with Bahuparaak, director   was looking for something different to do with his next. “I want to be able to make films in all genres. As a filmmaker, thrillers intrigue me and I thought it would be interesting to weave a dark   into it. But even though I had the basic plot line in place, making it into a workable script was tedious. I had many brainstorming sessions with my team, as the thing about comedy is that what you find funny may not be so for another. It is very difficult to make people laugh. We had to make sure that the situational comedy in our film works for all audiences,” says the filmmaker.
His film, Operation Alamelamma, is completely set in Bengaluru, with almost half of it transpiring at a police station. “The story revolves around the hero’s love for all things grand and glitzy, even though he is only a vendor in a market. When he gets embroiled in a kidnapping and its subsequent inquiry, we needed a newbie whom audiences would sympathize with, instead of a star who would be expected to walk out of the police station unscathed.   was a perfect fit for the role,” says Suni.
