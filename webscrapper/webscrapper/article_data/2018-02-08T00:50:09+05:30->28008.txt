Perambalur: A teacher, working in a school near Alathur in Perambalur district, was ordered a transfer on Wednesday by district collector V Shantha, after he was found guilty of beating up a class V student, who was differently-abled.

 When the student Mahendranâ€™s parents made a complaint against his teacher S Senthilkumar at Panchayat Union elementary school in Adhanur, Shantha instructed assistant elementary education officer (AEEO) C Rejina Mary to visit the school and investigate about the situation.
 
 While the investigation confirmed that the complaints against Senthilkumar were true, the district collector instructed AEEO to transfer the teacher. Following this, AEEO transferred the teacher to government elementary school at Anaipadi.
