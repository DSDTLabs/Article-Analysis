BENGALURU: A 7 km stretch of   in KR Puram, between   and Medahalli junction, has emerged as Bengaluru's most dreaded location over the past three years, recording the highest number of accidents (208) as well as the highest number of fatalities (54) between 2014 and 2016.

 The stretch tops a list of 17 black spots - road stretches or sites where a large number of accidents takes place - identified by a Bengaluru city traffic police study this year. It was the fifth most dreaded location in the 2015 study that listed 10 black spots, recording 641 accidents between 2012 and 2014.
 
 The situation at Madiwala junction, which had topped the 2015 list of black spots with 931 accidents, appears to have improved as only 12 accidents have been reported in the latest study. On the other hand, all accidents reported on the stretch in Rupena Agrahara, between   and  , involved fatalities. The junction is in the fourth position in the 2017 list.
 
 R Hithendra, additional commissioner of police (traffic), said their worries had changed since 2015 when the last report was prepared.“Earlier, accidents happened all day when the number of vehicles on the road was higher. But now the traffic speed is down to about 8.5kmph during the peak hours. Accidents do not happen during the peak hours. Instead, they are occurring more during night and early morning hours when there are less vehicles and speeding is rampant,“ added the official.
 
 Traffic police also blame the accidents on the personal vehicles on the road. “There are 70 lakh vehicles making about one crore trips daily on roads that are made to handle not more than 15 or 20 lakh vehicles. This disparity is the cause for such chaos on the roads,“ Hithendra said.
 
 The 2017 report also shows that roads in north Bengaluru are increasingly becoming dangerous, particularly signal-free corridors to and from the international airport along Ballari Road. The Hebbal-Kempapura-Columbia Asia Hospital stretch witnessed 60 accidents and 11 deaths between 2014 and 2016, while, Bhadrappa LayoutHebbal Lake entrance-Big Bazaar (500m) saw 44 accidents and nine fatalities. The corridor between Bethal AG Church and Lumbini Gardens on the   saw 30 accidents and 12 fa talities in the same period.
 
 The jurisdictions of Yelahanka and   traffic police account for four and three black spots respectively.While 56 accidents took place in the four stretches under Yelahanka police, the three black spots in Chikkajala recorded 109 accidents. The more deadly aspect of the find: there are more fatalities than accidents in these parts.
