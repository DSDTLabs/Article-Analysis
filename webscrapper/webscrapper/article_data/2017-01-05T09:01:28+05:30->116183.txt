PUNE: Mohammad Munir Daud Chinniwar, sleeping partner of Bakes N Cakes in which six workers suffocated to death, filed a bail application before the Pune Cantonment court on Wednesday.

 Judicial magistrate first class J S Kokate has directed inspector   of the   police station to file her say on the application at the earliest.
 
 The application was filed after Chinniwar and two others were produced before the court, following the expiry of their five day police custody remand.
 
 The suspects were remanded in magisterial custody till January 18 after the police did not press to extend the remand.
 
 Six workers died of suffocation while they were sleeping on the mezzanine floor of the bakery on   after a huge fire broke out on December 30 around 4.30am.
 
 The partners were arrested after investigations revealed that they had allegedly locked the two rolling shutters from outside, thereby preventing the workersâ€™ escape. It was also found that the floor was illegally extended and there was no ventilation.
 
 The application filed through lawyers M M Sayyed and   read that Chinniwar was the silent partner of the bakery and he was not responsible for the regular affairs of the business.
 
 It read that no prima facie case was made out against Chinniwar under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code because one shutter was locked from outside while the other was closed from inside. Chinniwar has also claimed bail on medical grounds as he was suffering from diabetes and hyper tension.
