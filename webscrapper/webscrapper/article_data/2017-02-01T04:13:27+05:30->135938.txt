NEW DELHIi:   had its Standing Committee   on Tuesday where the discussion was the university’s admission policy in light of the opposition of students and teachers over UGC’s May 2016 notification.

 According to a senior   official, “the meeting was adjourned due to a scuffle between the students outside the venue due to political differences. They broke the doors and made attempts to barge into the venue, leading to adjournment of the meeting.” JNUSU president  , however, denied that any such disruption took place and said that “students were only sloganeering outside the venue”.
 
 According to a senior JNU official, the goal of the meeting was “to adopt an admission policy that would safeguard social justice and the progressive policy of JNU within the parameters of UGC regulations.”
 
 Pandey said, “There was no prior agenda given for the meeting. It is a clear violation of norms.” This prompted the JNUSU to call for a protest at the administrative block demanding the implementation of the   recommendation and demanding a reduction in the viva-voce marks, which they termed as “discriminatory”.
 
 Similarly, a protest was called by members of BAPSA and the United OBC forum which wanted the JNUSU members to boycott the meeting.
 
 “We had told the JNUSU that if there is no agenda then they should not have attended the meeting,” said Amit Kumar, member of the United OBC forum and one of the students suspended by the administration.
 
 Students said, it was decided in the meeting that the viva percentage will be reduced from a 100% to 20%.
