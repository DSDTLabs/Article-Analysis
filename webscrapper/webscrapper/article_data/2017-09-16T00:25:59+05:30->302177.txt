MUMBAI: BMC is likely to table the   before the   for   on September 18. 

 Shiv Sena, which currently is the ruling party in BMC, supports the policy. But  , its former alliance partner in the civic body, has been at loggerheads with the Sena over the same.
 
 Yuva Sena president   took to Twitter seeking support of other political parties over the resolution when it comes up for discussion in the civic house. 
 
 “Some good news for Mumbai. Roof Top restaurants policy will mostly be approved this coming week, with safety riders suggested by us. Finally not only 5 star hotels, but places easily accessible to the common man, in non residential areas will have rooftop restaurants. The conditions and safety riders suggested by us will ensure safety to max, and no trouble to residents around. I urge all Parties to support this resolution whenever it comes up, as this will help an industry to create jobs, raise revenue for Govt,” he tweeted.
 
 BJP said it had ‘certain reservations’ about the policy, especially in residential areas. “However, based on the administration’s reply, we will take a decision at the meeting,” said Manoj Kotak, BJP party leader in BMC.
