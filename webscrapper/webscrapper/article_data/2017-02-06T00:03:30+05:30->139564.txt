MUMBAI: While all major parties are promising the moon in their manifestos, MIM leaders said they won’t release one as their “leaders’ words suffice”. “Our leaders like   and   have raised several civic issues in the last one month. Their speeches are as good as the party’s manifesto,” said MIM city unit chief Shakir Patni.

 MIM legislator Waris Pathan said that MIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s demand for over Rs 7000 crore in the BMC budget for Muslim-dominated areas is part of the party’s “unpublished manifesto”.
