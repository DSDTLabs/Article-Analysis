Thousands gathered at Fort Kochi, facing the sea, at 
  on January 1, 2017, ushering in the spirit of another New Year— a new beginning. They waited in excitement to see the 37-feet giant  , made as part of the  , being burnt — bringing lights of hope to their lives.

 Unlike the earlier Pappanji, this year’s was a unique one, as per the artists behind the work. It was supported with a strong base of around 5 ft and was made of eco-friendly materials. While it was being burnt without harming the environment, it looked like the hard work of around 20 workers for over a week under the supervision of artists K Reghunadhan and KG Anto, had finally paid off.
 
  K Reghunadhan says, “This year, we tried to break the monotony by giving it a form of a sculpture using a steel frame. The frame was filled with jute and cotton and the outer covering was later coloured to give it an attractive appearance.”
 
 This year’s Pappanji was not only environment friendly but could also be recycled. “The figurine would last long, as the raw materials used are an assortment of 12 pieces, thereby reducing the manual labour each year,” adds the artists behind it.
 
  Contrary to the public perception, the Pappanji has no connection with Santa Claus, says KG Anto, adding, “It refers to the colonial old man dressed in suit and boots, and setting fire to the effigy implies that we are bidding farewell to the past. It is also a means embracing the New Year.”
 
 The enthusiasm of the crowd, who gathered at the venue, was abounding and contagious, as they cheered on top of their voices. “Ringing in the New Year would not have been this amazing, without setting fire to the effigy, by burning the past away and welcoming a glorious present,” says Rahul K S from Wayanad who had come all the way to become part of the ritual.
