MYSURU: A baby born four days ago at a Mysuru hospital died on Friday reportedly due to severe lack of oxygen supply; its parents have accused doctors of negligence. 

  Sources said Namita, 20, from   village of   taluk, was admitted to   here on Tuesday night. Since she had completed 9 months, doctors decided to wait for a normal delivery. However, on Tuesday, they advised her family to go for C-section, and Namita delivered a boy at 9.40pm, weighing 2.6kg with 'O' negative blood group. 
 
  Namita's family accused the hospital of not allowing them to look at the baby, saying it was under neonatal care. Suddenly, hospital authorities informed the family on Friday morning that the infant was dead. 
 
 Aghast and angry, family members protested in front of the hospital, holding doctors responsible for the infant's death.   is one of the biggest children's hospitals in   region and attached to the Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute.
 
  Hospital superintendent Dr Radhamani told TOI: "According to our pediatrician, the baby died due to severe birth asphyxia (a condition of severe deficiency in supply of oxygen to the body). We suggested a postmortem to ascertain the cause of death, but family members didn't want it. Instead, they have filed a complaint to us, hinting at medical negligence. Based on that, we'll record doctors' statements. Prima facie, there is no such negligence." 
 
 The hospital established in 1880 sees 14,000 deliveries a year on an average. The number of deliveries and outpatients are on the rise each year.
