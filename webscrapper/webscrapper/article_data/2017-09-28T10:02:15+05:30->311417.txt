 still has that new-bride glow. The actress, who got married in August, is doubly excited about   this year -- it is, of course, her first pujo after marriage and there’s also the added celebration of her father’s birthday. 

 Talking to BT, Riya says, "This year, it feels magical. My husband,   and I are in Kolkata for the pujas. My mother ( ) has made sure that I look like the quintessential 
 Bengali bride for the festival." She adds, "This year will also mark my first ' ' (a ritual where married Bengali women smear each other with sindoor). All these years, my mother would attend this function alone and pray for her daughters’ marriage. She is really happy that I will accompany her this time around."
 
 For Riya, Durga Puja has always been synonymous with family reunion. Getting into a nostalgic mood, she says, "For me, this festival is all about meeting family and celebrating love and life. It has always been a tradition since my maternal grandmother’s (late  ) days."
 
 Ask her what more is in store this pujo and she replies, "Ashtami is coinciding with my father’s birthday, so there will be double celebrations. Also, Shivam has planned a trip to Amsterdam soon after the festival, and I am really looking forward to it."
