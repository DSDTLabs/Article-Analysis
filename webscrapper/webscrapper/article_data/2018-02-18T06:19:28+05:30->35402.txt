AHMEDABAD: It is still mid-February and Chandubhai Vakil, a resident of   town in Rajkot is worried about water. Currently, despite being in the vicinity of two dams —Bhadar 1 and Bhadar 2 — Dhoraji gets water only once in five days and that too for 20-25 minutes daily.

 "People store water in tanks in their houses and use it for drinking. For other purposes, people depend on  , which is depleting fast," said Vakil. "The water we get is not potable. We have to filter it before drinking. Taluka panchayat can’t get water from Bhadar 1-2 dams because the water is   from nearby industries. We have to depend on Phophal dam of Jam Kandorna."
 
 
 
  
 
 Threat of severe water crisis is looming large on residents of Saurashtra-Kutch regions. Usually, the water cut starts around mid-March but this year problems have started early.   fear that if monsoon is delayed even by a fortnight, the situation is going to be unbearable.
 
 Dhirubhai Gandhi, a farmer of Vadithal village in Abdasa taluka of Kutch, said: "Ground water level that was 600 feet deep a couple of months back has gone to 800 feet in February itself. This has increased the cost of farming." He feels that within the next 15-20 days even groundwater won’t be available. "Drinking water was not as good as was claimed by the state government," he said. "We have to purchase water from RO-plant owners because the panchayat water has high fluoride content."
 
 Narmada waters have reached only two talukas of Kutch Bhachau and Rapar. However, the supply has been suspended. Farmers in these talukas fear heavy crop loss. In contrast to Kutch, the Saurashtra region received fairly good rains this season. "In Saurashtra region, people are still able to use groundwater. But it won’t last more than a month," said Savarkundla Congress MLA Pratap Dudhat.
