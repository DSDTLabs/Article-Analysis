Indore: City traffic police officials have once again launched a drive to reinforce the compulsory helmet rule among riders. This is the third time in four months that officials have launched this drive. But, no one knows how long it would last. In the past, authorities would put up checkpoints at various major intersections in the city and riders without helmets were caught and fined. On Monday, they caught around 280 riders that were riding their vehicles without helmets. “We have once again launched a drive to rein in riders without helmets,” ASP (traffic) Pankaj Shrivastava told TOI. Shrivastava said that the month-long campaign was launched after the number of helmet related violations increased. Though the reason behind the sudden launch of the drive is not clear, it is being projected that a higher number of road accidents has stirred traffic cops to get tough. “We are taking the drive seriously and will continue it as long as possible,” he said. He added that motorists, especially youngsters, were being targeted as they are among the most frequent violators of the helmet rule. He said even drunk driving and over-speeding would also be checked.  Riding a two-wheeler without helmets is an offense, as stated in the Motor vehicles Act, and it is surprising that traffic cops have to resort to special drives to enforce it rather than penalising violators on a regular basis through the year. Moreover, it has been seen such drives lose steam in a few days.
