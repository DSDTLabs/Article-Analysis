CUTTACK: Traffic snarls at   have now become a regular occurence owing to encroachment by shopkeepers who now occupy a major portion of the road. There is little space left for pedestrians to walk on -- something that causes traffic snarls daily. 

 Despite several complaints, the   (CMC) has not initiated measures to remove encroachments. 
 
 "I often get stuck in traffic jams while going home through the area," said Zamil Khan, a resident of Odia Bazar. The road passing through the Choudhury Bazar market itself is very narrow.
 
 "This road was quite wide a few years ago, but the shops near the   of the Choudhury Bazar have illegally stocked their products on the road. Moreover, the tarpaulin above their shops extend over the road and cause terrible problems for commuters," said  , an octogenarian who passes through Choudhury Bazar daily.
 
 According to a source in the area, it is common practice for shopkeepers to remove articles from the roads during visits by VVIPs and then encroach upon the roads as usual once the visit is over.
 
 "We are trying our best to streamline traffic in city and we have written several times to the CMC to remove illegal encroachment from city roads but our letters have incited no response, said traffic ACP, P K Dalei.
 
 CMC commissioner Gyana Das said, "We are aware of the problem. We will discuss the matter and soon come up with an eviction drive."
