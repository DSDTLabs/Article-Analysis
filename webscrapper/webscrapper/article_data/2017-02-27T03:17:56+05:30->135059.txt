Saif Ali Khan's gorgeous daughter   has been making frequent appearances at B-town events and parties. She's fast becoming media's favourite girl. The youngster is surely grabbing eye balls with her style statement and stunning looks. Be it in a casual avatar or when she's dressed to kill for a party, Sara slays it every time. 

  
  
 We recently stumbled upon a picture of the 23-year-old at a wedding and spotted her wearing a beautiful   ensemble. She just upped the oomph factor with her stunning, deep-cut choli in gold which beautifully complements her otherwise vibrant ensemble. The look deserves a perfect ten, doesn't it?
  
  
  
 Sara, who is a spitting image of her mom and possesses her dad's charm, is all set to make her big   debut. While rumor mills are abuzz that the actress-in-the-making has been roped in by Dharma Productions for her first film, fans can't seem to contain their excitement to see the girl on the big screen.
