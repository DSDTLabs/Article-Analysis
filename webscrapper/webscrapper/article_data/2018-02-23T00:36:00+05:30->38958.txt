Tirunelveli: Namma Nellai, an app launched by the district administration on New Year’s Eve, has received good response from the public. More than 5,000 people have downloaded the app and many have also started using its features. District collector Sandeep Nanduri said that they had been successful in resolving close to 50 per cent of the grievances received through the app.

 “It would take time to resolve the other grievances as they are requests for infrastructure and facilities that require funds. We are working on them,” the collector said. People have reported around 150 incidents involving use of banned plastic carry bags as well as dumping of waste at public places. The app has also helped rope in more volunteers for the Swachh Bharat Mission.
 
 Though quite a few new features have been added to the app, which is being updated from time to time, some changes have disappointed the public. The contacts section had mobile numbers of the district collector and top officials in the police and other departments in the earlier version but now they have been removed. Officials said that this was following complaints from officials that they started receiving calls even late at night.
 
 “The collector’s number is available on the main page of the app whereas for other officials we have provided their official landline numbers,” the collector said. While the app has received a 4.7 star rating in Google Play Store, many of its users have requested that it be made available in Tamil so that it would reach a wider populace.
