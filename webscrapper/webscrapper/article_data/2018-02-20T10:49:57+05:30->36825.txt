MADURAI: A case filed by   Enterprises Private limited which imported sand from   before the Madras high court Madurai bench challenging a government order issuing guidelines for regulation of storage, transportation and sale of imported sand, is likely to be heard by the high court principal seat at Chennai.

 When the case came up for admission before justice  , the government wanted the case to be transferred to the principal seat saying that a similar case is pending there. 
 
 Following it, the court directed the government to approach the registry in that regard and adjourned the case by three weeks. 
 
 The company’s managing director M R M Ramaiya filed the case saying that in order to regulate imported sand the   government has no source of power under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act and the Tamil Nadu Minerals and Mineral Dealers Rules. 
 
 But, the public works department (PWD) passed the order dated December 8, 2017. 
 
 Besides, the government is not in a position to lay down procedure for implementation of the government order. Further, citing the government order, the   district administration seized imported sand of the petitioner’s company, while it was transporting the sand to its customers. 
 
 At the same time, another importer (Aakar Enterprises, Chennai) who imported sand from Malaysia brought it to the   port trust in Tuticorin, took it to   and is selling there.
 
 With this, it was clear that the government lacked transparency and vague, the petitioner said and had prayed to quash the government order and to forbear the state from interfering with storage, transportation and sale of imported sand.
