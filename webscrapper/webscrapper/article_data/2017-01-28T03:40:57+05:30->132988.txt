NEW DELHI: The   (DCW) has issued a notice to   of   on Friday, asking the college to send a point-wise reply to a memorandum it has received from students of   (SOL).

 The commission has asked the college to reply within seven days of the receipt of the notice, “failing which appropriate action shall be initiated as per law”.
 
 In its memorandum to the DCW, the Krantikari Yuva Sangathan (KYS) had alleged on Tuesday that the college, which has been allotted as the study centre, has framed “highly discriminatory and anti-women rules” to “harass women students of SOL”. 
 
 The students’ group cited an unsigned circular by Miranda House putting a ban on clicking selfies and combing hair in the college corridor.
 
 Stating that the representation is self-explanatory, the DCW stated that “in light of this, please provide the commission a point-wise reply on the representation.”
 
 The principal of the college could not be contacted. The chairperson of the Campus of Open Learning, C S Dubey, said that the college has always been very helpful to the SOL as well as non-collegiate students.
 
 “In fact the principal has gone out of the way to conduct special programmes for these students. Yes, the number of SOL students turning up at Miranda House, Hans Raj College or Arts Faculty is significantly higher than other centres, but that is because of the good faculty and facility. Therefore at times there may be space crunch.”
 
 The memorandum submitted to the DCW sought a written apology from the college, alleging that the college authorities tried to forcibly take away the identity cards of students who wanted to enter the college and those who refused were being turned away.
