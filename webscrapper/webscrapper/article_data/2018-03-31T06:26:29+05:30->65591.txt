KOLKATA: The  , which has so far attached   properties worth Rs 4,200 crore, is likely to attach some more proerties sometime next month. According to sources, the agency has already identified properties of the group worth Rs 400 crore.

 On Thursday, the agency made one of the largest attachments in the country — pegged at Rs 2,300 crore — in connection with its probe into the Rose Valley scam. “We should be close to Rs 5,000crore mark in terms of attachments in the case soon,” said an   official.
 
 
 Incorporated in 1999, Rose Valley came under the Sebi scanner in 2013. The ED took up the case in 2015 following several complaintsfiledby the investors and Rose Valley boss   was arrested in March, 2015.
 
 It was found that Kundu had allegedly mopped up Rs 17,000 crore from investors, alluring them with high returns, through a web of 27 companies. More than Rs 12,300 crore was collected from investors in Bengal, Assam, Tripura and Odisha. The money was subsequently laundered in associate companies of Rose Valley group and was used to purchase moveable and immoveable properties. Before Kundu was arrested, the group claimed that they had 23 hotels and resorts in various stages of completion.
 
 The agency first attached 2,630 bank accounts of the group resulting in a cash haul of Rs 296 crore in November, 2014. While no attachment was done in 2015, sources in ED said that they started tapping some company insiders. In 2016, the agency attached properties worth Rs 450 crore and Rs 1,250 crore in March and December respectively. Six hotels and a fleet of expensive cars, including a Rolls Royce worth Rs 6 crore, were attached. Next year, the agency suspended the investigating officer Manoj Kumar following several charges. “Once we receive the attachment order wewill appeal in the adjudicating tribunal,” Kundu’s lawyer Biplab Goswami said.
