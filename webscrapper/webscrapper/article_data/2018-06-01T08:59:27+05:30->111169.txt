CHENNAI: When 12-year-old   (name changed), who sells colouring books, saw crowds in   moving from the mall in the area to the metro station on Sunday, he followed suit. “That’s how I took my first metro rail ride. I went to Central and returned because I knew I would not be able to afford it on any other day,” he said, shyly trying to coax passersby to buy one of his books.

 
 Like Harish, most passengers who boarded the metro for free rides over four days, until Tuesday, are unlikely to do so again. It’s not just the ticket fare but also the lack of last-mile connectivity that has led to passengers giving up on it. “Why should I spend ?40 from   to the airport when I need to shell out ?40 more to reach the station? When three family members travel, it amounts to ?160, the same as the cab fare which is more convenient,” said  , 56, who took the metro on Sunday.
 
 Metro Rail data shows daily passenger flow was above 1,20,500, when the rides were free. The ridership fell to 55,640 on Wednesday. The number is slightly more than the average of 30,000, an official said. “Feeder services are a way of improving access to stations and so is the provision of footpath and cyclesharing services to enhance last-mile connectivity. Improving infrastructure for nonmotorised transit makes it safer for commuters and could improve ridership,” said   of   and Development Policy.
