 The 21-year-old Yuqi, who had beaten Prannoy at the Indonesian Masters 2015, opened a slender 11-9 lead at the break of the opening game. The Indian then surged to a 18-13 advantage only to let the Chinese claw his way back to pocket the first game.
 
 In the second game, Yuqi was more dominant as he broke off at 7-7 to distance himself from the Indian and eventually seal his place in the semifinals without much ado.
