LUCKNOW: A meeting between heads of all departments from the science faculty at   on Wednesday failed to arrive at a consensus on introducing multiple choice questions (MCQs) at the   in exams.

 A heated discussion took place with a majority of heads opposing the decision in more than an hour’s discussion. The meeting was called by dean of sciences.
 
 Opposing MCQ-based examination, heads of many departments debated that it would not prepare students for competitive examination as argued but will deteriorate the quality of higher education. “Even in civil services, the candidate selects a subject for the mains on which knowledge is tested through long answers,” said a professor.
 
 Defending the proposal, another professor said, “In  , examination can never be guesswork as negative marking will be in place. Besides, a student needs to know each aspect of the subject as the question can be asked from anywhere.”
 
 Another professor said it was a transparent system where a student would be awarded marks not on ‘making up’ stories in the answer copy but on a   answer.
 
 Besides, evaluation of answer copies would not take time and it would test a professor’s ability and knowledge of a subject as they can set an   only after in-depth knowledge, added the professor.
