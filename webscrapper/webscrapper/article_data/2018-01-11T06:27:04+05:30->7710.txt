AHMEDABAD: Vadaj police busted factory where   was being bottled, close to the   near Anandnagar Derasar. 

 Two persons, Shankar Marwadi and Balwantsinh Rajput, both residents of Ranip were held at the spot. 
 
 Empty liquor bottles of premium brand, stickers and cheap IMFL were seized from the spot. Police sources said the two persons arrested had been running the factory for about two months and would sell the cheap liquor mixed with fruit essence, to make it better, as premium liquor.
 
 “They would provide a home delivery service, and charged customers between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,000 per bottle, which had cost them no more than Rs 300. We have found empty bottles of imported liquor and a diary containing the names of their customers,” said a police official.
 
 In the last year, three such spurious liquor units have been busted by police in the Ghatlodia and Vadaj areas of the city.
