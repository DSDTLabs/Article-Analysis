AMARAVATI: Making   a healthy state may remain a dream in the years to come as the government is concentrating only on strengthening votebanks, instead of stepping up institutional capacity, say budget analysts.

 The increased role of private players in handling healthcare services, from primary   centres to general hospitals, is going to weaken further public health institutions, say experts. 
 
 Dinance minister Yanamala Ramakrishunudu gave around Rs 8,463 crore to the health and family welfare  , which is less than 1% per cent of the stateâ€™s Gross State Domestic Product ( ), pegged at Rs 8,70,330 crore. 
 
 While the state has had stunning achievements in IT, marine exports, mines and industries, the health sector is still lagging behind, thanks to the poor infrastructure of public health institutions. 
 
 After seeing the positive response to the Arogyasri scheme launched by former chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy, the Chandrababu Naidu government intensified its investments into the schemes being managed by the private sector. About Rs 1,400-Rs 1,600 crore was exclusively spared for implementation of NTR Vaidya Seva (new version of Arogya Sri) and other health insurance schemes from the total outlay of the health department. This is nearly 20% of the total budget. Similarly, all the diagnostic services right from simple blood test to expensive CT scan were privatised to satisfy the people.
 
 According to a study, nearly 80% of the total grants of health sector is going into the private hands leaving meagre amounts to consolidate the existing system. While prestigious general hospitals at Guntur, Vijayawada and   cities are struggling to meet the patient rush, the government is spending huge on private services as it has opened doors for   mode even in the big GGHs.
