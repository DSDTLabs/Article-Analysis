BAREILLY: The future of more than 125 students of an institute of paramedical science hang in the balance after the   (UGC) listed  , to which the institute is affiliated to, as fake. These students, who have paid annual fees ranging from Rs 50,000 to Rs 70,000 staged a protest demonstration at the collectorate on Tuesday demanding that they be shifted to another college and fee refund.
 
  According to the officials, an institute of paramedical science was affiliated to Vishwakarma Open University. A resident of the city had lodged a complaint with the district administration that the University Grant Commission listed Vishwakarma Open University as fake in September last year and hence, the degree offered by this Bareilly-based paramedical science institute is also fake.
  
  “During investigation, it came to light that the degree offered by this institute, showing affiliation to Vishwakarma Open University, is fake. The management of the college claimed that their affiliation with Vishwakarma Open University ended on April 10, 2017, and that the institute was now affiliated to the Paramedical Council Of India. We are probing their claim,” said  , district higher education officer.
  
  Yadav added that if the institute turns out to be fake, there is no policy to shift the students elsewhere.
  
  Meanwhile, students of the institute, along with members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad ( ) put a lock on the institute gate on Tuesday morning. The students also staged a protest demonstration at the collectorate and later at the tehsil office. “We are clueless regarding the validity of our degrees. Neither the college authorities nor the district administration has clarified whether the institute is affiliated with Paramedical Council Of India or not. We want the government to shift to us to another college,” said Preeti Gangwar, a student of general nursing midwife (GNM).
  
  Preeti's classmate   said the institute should refund their fees.
