CHANDIGARH: The   and   high court has issued notice to Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32 and sought its reply for not giving admission to petitioner in MD/MS course 2018. Dr   has moved HC stating that despite having a domicile of Chandigarh, she was declared ineligible by GMCH. The matter is slated to come up for hearing on April 18. It was also said that the petitioner cannot be denied admission as she has a domicile of Chandigarh and could not be denied the benefit under   pool quota.

 The list came out on March 26, 2018, which declared the petitioner ineligible for the admission to MD/MS (state quota) course 2018 with a remark stating “MBBS not from Chandigarh”. It was argued that the petitioner has done matriculation from Chandigarh and also, scored 580 marks in NEET PG 2018 amounting to a percentile of 91.42. It was also stated that the total number of seats for admission in the year 2018 are 125, which are divided into all India quota and UT pool.
 
 As per rules and prospectus under UT pool, only those who have cleared MBBS from a medical institution situated in UT and are residing in UT can avail the benefit of getting admission under UT pool quota. It was stated that the petitioner’s all India rank was 11063. But, candidates with lower ranks have been included in the merit list by applying wrong principle of keeping all seats only for candidates who have passed their MBBS from medical institution within the boundary of Chandigarh, which is contrary to the law laid down by courts in various judgements whereby 100 percent institutional reservation is not allowed.
