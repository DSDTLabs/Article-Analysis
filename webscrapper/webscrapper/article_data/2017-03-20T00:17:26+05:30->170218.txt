MUMBAI: From the next academic year,   will have an additional question: “Have you enrolled your name in voters’ list?”

  has asked all its affiliated colleges and its departments to include this question in the forms as most students complete 18 years of age before entering  . The university has also sought suggestions from colleges and department heads on whether enrolment in voters’ list should be mandatory.
 
 The department of students’ welfare recently issued a circular asking colleges to submit their report on the change in the admission form in a stipulated time. The circular has been issued in pursuance of the Maharashtra government’s and the state election commission’s move to increase enrolment among young voters. Colleges claim that it may not be a problem to include a question in the admission forms at this stage for first-year students, but it should not be included in the second- and third-year admission process. However, not many are in favour of making the process mandatory.
 
 Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, said it should not be a problem to seek the voters’ list enrolment detail in the admission form as their process is online. “College students should be encouraged to enrol themselves in the voters’ list and exercise their voting rights, but one cannot disqualify any student for admission on the basis of this information,” she said. 
 
 Another principal said that awareness campaigns help in increasing enrolment among young voters, but such a question in admission forms will not serve any purpose as students do not pay attention to the forms. “In any case, the voters’ registration process is not an ongoing process and therefore, it cannot be made mandatory. NSS students carrying out awareness campaigns during elections is the best possible way to increase voter enrolment,” the principal added.
