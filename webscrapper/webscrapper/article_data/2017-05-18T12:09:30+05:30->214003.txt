LUCKNOW: Following an order passed by the   Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), the Gomtinagar police has registered an   against top brass of   Inc and   as well as an individual for circulating online a defamatory statement against a local  . . 

 The CJM had passed the order on an application moved by advocate Ranjana Dixit under Section 156(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code. In her application, the applicant had stated that she had uploaded her professional details on the Just Dial through Google.

She and her relatives saw the content and lodged a complaint with officials of Just Dial and Google who assured her that it would be removed. But till date the said content was not removed. 
 
 “The content is defamatory and it lowers the applicant’s image,”stated the application. The applicant had requested the CJM to get registered an FIR against the erring officials and the person who had made defamatory statement against her online.
 
 Allowing the said application on May 4, the CJM had stated that following a report sought from the Gomtinagar police it came to light that no FIR was registered in this connection. Later, on his directive the Gomtinagar police on May 13 registered an FIR against the officials of Just Dial and Google as well as the person who had made the objectionable remark against the advocate under Section 66(C) of the Information Technology (amendment) Act 2008.
 
 Meanwhile, IT experts here say that while Google is just a search engine, there could be some ground to pursue case against Just Dial.
