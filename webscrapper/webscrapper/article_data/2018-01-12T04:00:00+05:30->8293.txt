Gandhinagar: The state government on Thursday ordered a preliminary inquiry into the alleged irregularities in the project. 

 Chief secretary J N Singh told TOI, “Looking at the controversies regarding certain tenders and contract-related issues in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), it has been decided that additional chief secretary, health & family welfare, Poonamchand Parmar, will conduct a preliminary inquiry into the issue. 
 
 Parmar has served as ACS urban development department earlier and therefore the inquiry has been handed to him.” Parmar has been asked to submit a report within a week.
 
 On the basis of the report, the government will decide whether a further probe is required or not. The preliminary inquiry is not against the municipal commissioner Vinod Rao but finding out facts of the overall matter. “If commissioner's role is found, necessary action will be taken against him by the government," said Singh.
