HYDERABAD: While the Charminar Pedestrianisation Project ( ), along the Charminar to   stretch, is racing to completion, work around   continues to move at a snail's pace.

 
  
  
 
 With barely days left for  , masjid staff and shop owners near the holy shrine fear that the open manholes and construction material dumped on the road in front of the mosque might cause inconvenience to thousands of devout who will turn up soon.
 
 “There are four to five open manholes in this area along with heaps of construction material. Though they have dumped all the material here, they are not doing any work on this side of the structure,” said Md Aneez, a fruit shop owner. He added: “Ramzan is just a week away; authorities should have completed this side first rather than finishing most of the work on the other side.”
 
 For workers paving stones in the immediate vicinity of Charminar, though, it is a race against time. They have to finish work on the front of the monument and then begin work on the side of the Mecca Masjid. “We were asked to finish as much work as possible by the end of this week because more people will be visiting the mosque during Ramzan,” a worker said. Currently, about three stretches of Charminar have cobbled stones laid.
 
 “We have been inspecting ongoing works. Works on the Mecca Masjid side will be completed in the next three or four days,” maintained Dattu Panth, executive engineer,   assuring that work around the mosque will be finished soon.
