CHANIGARH: Reacting to Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s comment hinting at   as a CM pick in Punjab,   (SAD) on Tuesday said the “secret ambitions of the AAP supremo were out, but the state would not vote for an outsider”.

 “Arvind Kejriwal has tried hard to keep secret his wish to become Punjab chief minister. However, Punjabis will not let this happen. The cat is out of the bag,” said SAD spokesperson  .
 
 SAD accused Kejriwal of shunting out local leaders who were becoming claimants to the top post in Punjab. “It will also be worth seeing whether AAP candidate   whose claim to the post was rejected outrightly," said Sirsa.
 
 SAD said AAP’s double standards towards Punjab stood exposed as Kejriwal had announced a local CM candidate for Goa, but did not wish to do so in Punjab. Sirsa said Sisodia’s statements were testiomny to speculations of suspended MPs Dharmvira Gandhi and H S Khalsa that Kejriwal wanted to be the CM of Punjab.
