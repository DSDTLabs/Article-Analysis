CHENNAI: Sunday marked the completion of 60 days since the Centre scrapped the high denomination currency notes, but the tourism industry in south India is yet to completely recover from the demonetisation blues.
 
 Representatives of the hotel and travel sector from  ,   and  , who are participating in the Travel & Tourism Fair (TTF) in Chennai, said the demonetisation drive has hit the industry to the core causing drop in number of bookings, cancellations, besides reluctance to travel due to currency crunch.
  
 For instance, the annual visits of students in groups during the yearend to a private resort in Ooty was put off in 2016. "Our resort had accommodated three to four such student groups in December, 2015.

 The section of travellers preferring cash transactions for reservations are the ones whose numbers have dwindled. 
 
 Mathew Vengalathil, general manager (sales and marketing) of resorts located at Coorg in Karnataka and Wayanad in Kerala, said they were witnessing a drop in the number of tourists from Maharashtra and Gujarat, post-demonetisation.
 
 Another participant from Mysore, who offers transport vehicles for tourists, said the reluctance to travel was visible among all categories of travellers though the scenario is reviving. "People were not willing to stand in queues before ATMs. The situation has started improving (slowly), but not recovered completely," he said.
