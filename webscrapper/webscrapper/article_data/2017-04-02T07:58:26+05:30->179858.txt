PATNA: Urban development and housing department minister   on Saturday said the state government will notify the much-awaited   (Regulation and Development) Act 2017 by April 30 to bring the unregulated real estate sector under its domain.
 
  The minister, who held a meeting with officials concerned to discuss modalities for the  , said, “All   consisting eight or more flats and having an area of 500sq ft or more will come under the purview of the Act.”
  
  According to sources present at the meeting, once the Act is in place, builders, landowners and constructors will have to get themselves registered with the government. “Purchase and sale of real estate properties will be allowed only through registered agents, whose licences will be valid for five years,” the sources added.
  
  Sources privy to the development said all the new projects have to be registered within 30 days of notification of the new rule and the ongoing projects will be given three months’ time for registration. “It will be mandatory for the builders to upload all information regarding their projects on the   of real estate regulatory authority. Flats will be sold on the basis of carpet area, and not super built up area, which many real estate agents do to fool the buyers. The super built up area also includes common areas like lobby, stairs and lift shafts,” they added.
  
  In case the project is delayed, builders, and not buyers, will have to pay monthly interest to the bank concerned. “Builders will also have to open a separate escrow account to deposit 70% of the money collected for the project. They will be allowed to withdraw the amount only for construction purpose. An appellate tribunal will also be formed to the listen to the grievances related to real estate sector,” the sources said.
