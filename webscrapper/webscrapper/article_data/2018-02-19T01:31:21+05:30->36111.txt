GHAZIABAD: Two persons were arrested on Sunday for allegedly running   lots in the Trans-Hindon area. The crackdown followed an FIR filed against unauthorised parking that was registered on Saturday on the basis of a complaint by the GMC. The men have been identified as Radheshyam and  , who live in Lal Quan and  , respectively.

 On Saturday, a team of officials from the municipal corporation conducted a survey of areas around Vaishali and Kaushambi Metro stations, Yashoda Hospital in Kaushambi and several areas in Vasundhara. A complaint in this regard was lodged with the police by a municipal corporation employee, Raj Kumar, who had surveyed these areas with a team of officials.
 
 “We found several vehicles parked around these points. There were no contracts given by the municipal corporation to run parking lots at these points. Locals told us that fees are charged by certain individuals to park vehicles at these points. However, we did not find any parking attendant at these points,” Raj Kumar told TOI.
 
 An FIR had been registered on Saturday against unidentified persons at Indirapuram police station under IPC Section 384 (extortion) on the basis of the complaint by the corporation.
 
 “These two men had been running an illegal parking lot behind   on a road leading to Sector 4. Due to this, the road used to be congested,” said Indirapuram police station in-charge Pawan Kumar.
 
 The district administration is probing the role of cops in the traffic and police department to ascertain if they are in cahoots with illegal parking contractors. Corporation officials said further inspections would be undertaken to identify more such parking lots.
 
 Municipal commissioner Chandra Prakash Singh said: “We have recently suspended an official, Gaurav Kumar, who was in charge of parking facilities across the city. His role was found suspect in unauthorised parking lots operating around the city.”
