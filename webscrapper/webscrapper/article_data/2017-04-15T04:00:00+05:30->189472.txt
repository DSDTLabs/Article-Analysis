Rajkot: A forest guard posted in Dalkhaniya Range was brutally wounded after being assaulted by a local villager at Shermardi checkpost late on Thursday night. The victim Bhanu Dagda was on duty at the checkpost when he stopped the villager Kalu Makrani from entering the forest area as the deadline to go inside was nearing completion. However, Makrani, who has a field in the protected area, got enraged and attacked Dagda with some sharp weapon.  “Dagda has received deep cuts on his face and admitted to the Amreli Civil Hospital. A police complaint has also been lodged against Makrani,” said AP Singh, chief conservator of forests. Makrani has also been booked under atrocities act and the investigation has been handed over to the deputy superintendent of police rank officer. This is the second attack on on-field staff of the forest department staff in the last 45 days. Earlier on March 6, a forest trekker Dharmendra Vala was stabbed to death during an attack on a forest patrol by seven men when he stopped them from watching an illegal lion show on the fringes of Gir forest in Amreli district.
