At a time when the inner child is lost amid adult realities, we often wish to return to the world of fantasy so beautifully captured in Bengali literature. Soukarya Ghosal’s next directorial,  , promises to tickle your tastebuds for that long-lost fantasy world. He brings to life some endearing characters in Ghoton, played by child artiste Mahabrata Basu, Poripishi, played by  , and Gondaria, played by   in the film. “It is a food fantasy film that evokes   through the fantasy stories in Bengali literature. For example, Poripishi is a tribute to Leela Majumdar’s popular character. The film tries to emulate the essence that Sandesh used to bring to every household,” said Soukarya.
What sets this film apart is that it brings together Bengalis’ love for food, fantasy and films together under one umbrella. The characters like the fairy aunt, the villainous uncle and an oppressed special child are realistically portrayed though they are a part of the fantasy world. “The film encourages people to keep the faith going. The fantastical, science and technology are brought together for a brighter chance of wish fulfilment. It’s also a food fantasy because the seven tastes — sweet, salty, sour, spicy, pungent, astringent and bitter — contribute to the storyline,” Soukarya added. If you wish to go back to your childhood, enjoy the summer break with your child and watch a fantasy flick in Bengali, it’s Rainbow Jelly for you.
