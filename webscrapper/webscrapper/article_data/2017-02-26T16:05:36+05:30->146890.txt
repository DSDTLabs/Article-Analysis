 has been in the business of producing and distributing movies for a decade, and if there is one thing that he has steadfastly stood by in all these years is his firm belief in 'content is king'. Which is also why, year-on-year he has been associating himself with films that have been appreciated for their storyline, both as a producer and distributor. 'My journey in showbiz began in 1984, when I launched a music label called Jhankar   to handle non-film music. In less than a decade, though, I began acquiring music rights for films as well, and by 2007 I forayed into film production with my banner, Mars Films, with the Sudeep-starrer Mussanje Mathu. Over the past decade, I have distributed at least 40-50 Kannada films,' Bharat explains.
A closer look at some of the films that Bharat has chosen to distribute reveals an interesting pattern 'many of them are relatively smaller projects, often with no big stars at the helm, which don't find distributors easily. 'In the past few years, the films that have really shone at the box office have been these smaller films, which goes to show that the industry is poised for a change. Audiences are appreciating the efforts put in by these filmmakers in giving them quality movies. If I like the script of a film, I go all out to support the project in whatever way I can. Given that I am also a music man, we then work on that aspect first, to ensure that we have a good OST,' he says.
 Bharat's next venture is this week's release,  , a project he has been involved with since its inception. 'I have known director-actor   since his days as an RJ. His first short film was made in my studio and when he told me about the idea for this film, it intrigued me. The screenplay underwent many changes until we froze on the final version and I am glad that I am associated with this film,' he signs off.
