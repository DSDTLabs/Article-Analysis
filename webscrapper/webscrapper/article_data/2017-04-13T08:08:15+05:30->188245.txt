 The DMK leaders comprising Durai Murugan, R S Barathi, Trichy N Siva and T K S Elangovan submitted a memorandum written by the party working President M K Stalin requesting the governor to advice the center to initiate a CBI probe into the alleged electoral corruption by the ministers.
 
 Stalin, in the petition, requested the governor to call for the resignation of KA Sengottaiyan, Dindigul C Srinivasan, P Thangamani, SP Velumani, D Jayakumar, Sellur K Raju, MC Sampath, VM rajalakshmi, Vellamandi N Natarajan and S Valarmathi, besides Edappadi K Palaniswami immediately. "On failure to do so, dismiss them from the office so as to uphold constitutional values and morality" said Stalin.
 
 The DMK's move to mount pressure on the governor to act against AIADMK government comes in the wake of Election Commission rescinding RK Nagar bypoll following I-T raids in the residence of health minister C Vijayabaskar. The raids revealed purported evidences of bribing of voters in RK Nagar. Stalin alleged citing media reports that the IT officials had seized documents revealing conspiracy between the Chief Minister and other Ministers to distribute about 89 crore to 2.24 lakhs voters in RK Nagar constituency. 
 
 Stalin said chief minister Edapadi K Palaniswami and the ministers named in the document seized from the house of Vijayabaskar prove that they systematically carried out bribery of voters and are liable to be convicted and disqualified from holding elected office. Such flagrant and unrepentant acts of these persons should not go unpunished, he said.
