 shot for a song sequence that features her in  , the   remake of the Bollywood film Queen. The team for the Ramesh Aravind-directed film is in   for the shoot. The team shot for this song that has been penned by Yogaraj Bhat and set to tune by Amit Trivedi over the weekend. Bollywood choreographer Caesar, who had choreographed London Thumakada, flew down to choreograph this song as well.

 “It was a lovely experience to shoot for this song. The Kannada audience knows me for my dancing skills. This song is very candid and it didn’t have any typical filmi dance moves. This was tough for me. But Caesar complimented my dancing and coming from a famed Bollywood technician like him, it counts as one of the best praises I have received,” adds Parul, about this song which has the lyrics Naale Namma Malelondu Baala Dodda Kaaryakrama. The film is nearly complete, says Parul, adding, “We have have two more songs to complete, one of which is a club number and we are mostly remixing an old Kannada track for the same.” 
 
 
 Rumour has it that the team of the south remakes of Queen has wound up its Mysuru schedule after shooting the ‘Wedding Song’ for the Kannada version. According to initial reports, choreographer Caesar was to work with Parul Yadav on the Kannada version on April 7 and 8, followed by Kajal Aggarwal for the Tamil version thereafter. The latest, we hear, is that the schedule has been postponed, as Kajal did not make it to Mysuru following renewed protests in the Cauvery water sharing issue.
