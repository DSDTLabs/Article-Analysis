The fall from grace of a rising star in China's   sheds light on how a reshuffle of the country's top officials may play out under the leadership of President   later this year. Sun Zhengcai, 53, the youngest member of the ruling  , was replaced on Saturday as party chief of Chongqing. He is under investigation for violating party regulations, according to officials. Sun was replaced by his longtime associate Chen Miner, 56, who was party chief of the province of Guizhou. The officials said they were told by a senior local party member to eliminate Sun's influence.
 
 Sun's downfall underscored Xi's dominance ahead of a congress that will set the tone for his second five-year term as president. Sun's age and rank had positioned him to advance to the Politburo's smaller, supreme   at the upcoming congress. That could have set up him for a top leadership post after 2022. The ousting of another former Chongqing chief,  , jolted the last party shuffle in 2012. Bo is now serving a life sentence for graft and abuse of power.
  
 “Sun's removal suggests maneuvering before the leadership changes and points to the president being in full control of the political situation,“ said Zhang Jian, a professor. The 19th congress is expected to be held in the final quarter and will mark the halfway point for Xi's term in power. He and Premier Li Keqiang are the only ones on the seven member Standing Committee expected to stay on.
  
 The president has been amassing power ahead of the reshuffle. Xi was given the status of “core leader“ at a conclave in 2016, a significant change in China's politics, which has for three decades stressed on collective leadership. And Xi's undertaken a sweeping crackdown on graft in the party that may give him the opportunity to fill top posts with allies.
