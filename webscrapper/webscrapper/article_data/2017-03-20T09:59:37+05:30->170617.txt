RANCHI:   is a worried man and the Australian coach has reasons for it. "Obviously we have got to save the game. Tough to lose those two wickets tonight (Sunday) but they were some good balls from them. It's obviously a case of applying ourselves much like   and Saha did," said Lehmann.

 Despite the fast bowlers creating a rough outside the left-hander's off-stump with their follow-through, Lehmann sounded confident. "There will be some for the left-handers but the ball that got   was a great one. But we have got to cope with it as best we can and come up with a plan."
 
 He felt that they needed to bat a bit longer in their first innings. "When you bowl 210 overs... I don't think that has happened too often. India generally bat for a longer period of time here. If anything, we needed to bat a bit longer but the bowlers were fantastic."
 
 Lehmann wanted his team to gear up for the 'challenge' ahead on Day Five. "We have to come up with a plan to combat  . We have worked on that and probably we will see it tomorrow (Monday). The challenge for our group is to put on a couple of partnerships and get ahead of the game," he stated.
