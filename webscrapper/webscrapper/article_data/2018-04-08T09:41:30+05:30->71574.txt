LUCKNOW: Days after two BJP MPs wrote to Prime Minister  , another parliamentarian from UP's Nagina, Yashwant Singh, has written to the Centre on the increasing marginalisation of the Dalit community in India while questioning the failed promises on pending bills on quota in promotions. 

 "Even after four years of completion of this government, no welfare work has been done for a single one of 30 crore Dalits. Being a Dalit, even my capabilities have not been used," Singh said in his letter.
 
 His remarks come two days after three other Dalit BJP MPs-Savitri Bai Phule, Chhota Lal and Ashok Kumar Dohre-from Uttar Pradesh directly accused the Yogi government and NDA of growing atrocities on Dalits.
 
 In his letter, Singh, a doctor from AIIMS with a postgraduate degree from the US, said that the Centre had failed to use his capabilities. He claimed that reservation was a lifeline for Dalits.
 
 "This includes backlog of development work, reservation in promotions and private companies," he has pointed out. 
 
 He said there was no representation of Dalits in the courts, holding this as one of the reasons to have decisions against Dalits. 
 
 Singh said that 70% of the country's property belongs to 1% of the people who receive government protection. Nearly 25% of the population probably owns 0.5% of property. 
 
 "Dalit society cannot progress without good government policies," said Singh.
 
 Like other BJP MPs, in his letter, Singh has also appealed to the government to ensure the   overturns the decision on the SC/ST Act.
