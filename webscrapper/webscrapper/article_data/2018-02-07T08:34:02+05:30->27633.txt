KOCHI: Teen mothers are a reality in the state. However, compared to the national average, the proportion of teen mothers in   is lesser. About 3% teenagers in the age group of 15 to 19 years were already   in the state at the time of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) -4. The national average is 8%.

 Though this is down from 5.8 % 10 years ago in 2005-06, when NFHS -3 was conducted, the government authorities are concerned. "There is lot of under-aged marriages happening in Kerala, which is a shameful fact," said health secretary Rajeev Sadanandan. NFHS-4 shows that there are about 7.6% women in the age group of 20-24 years who were married before the age of 18. 
 
  
  
 
 However, statistics with state government department shows that teen mothers are much lesser. "Our figures show that about 1.8% to 1.9% in the age group of 15-19 years were already mothers or pregnant. And the trend is seen more in the age group of 18-19," said Dr   S, additional director, National Health Mission. 
 
 Maximum cases of women aged 15-19 years, who were already mothers or pregnant at the time of NFHS -4, is in   (5.8%), followed by Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram (3.5 % each). No such case is reported from   and Kottayam. 
 
 Gynaecologists in the state agree that they do come across cases of teenage pregnancy. "However, compared to the rest of India it is much lower. There are some in Kerala who still get married around the age of 18,"said Indian Society for Assisted Reproduction Kerala chapter secretary, Dr Fessy Louis T.
 
  "I believe that majority of pregnant mothers would be between the age of 18 and 19. Sexual contact with a wife below 18 is a punishable offence and if any pregnant girl below the age of 18 comes to a doctor, they have to immediately inform the police as it comes under the Pocso Act," said Dr  , department of obstetrics & gynaecology, Sree Narayana Institute of Medical Sciences, Ernakulam.
