NAVI MUMBAI: An awareness campaign on the cruel and illegal practices employed by the snake charmers on   was held at Bharati Vidyapeeth (Marathi Medium) School in   and Panvel on Thursday. 

 Snake activists and sarpa mitras from a snake awareness association and schoolchildren took part in large numbers to sensitize citizens. 
 
 Taking undue advantage of the ritual of offering milk to snakes during Nagpanchami, snake charmers catch and ill-treat snakes. 
 
 Some of them remove the reptile’s fangs, venom ducts and stitch the snake’s mouth in order to produce them in front of the devotees during the religious festival. 
 
 Snake activists went across city nodes to inform the citizens about way to handle snakes. They spoke of the behavioural patterns of snakes with the help of visual aids and the various species.
 
 Around 450 students organized a rally with posters and banners, distributed pamphlets to educate people. 
 
 Children were told how to deal with snake bite, use first aid and save snakes instead of harming them.
