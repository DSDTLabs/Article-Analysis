KOLKATA: Even as 40   leaders from Delhi will cover all 42 Lok Sabha constituencies of Bengal before next year’s panchayet elections, the state leadership has decided to identify and oust inactive party members from the organisation.
 
  BJP state secretariat member and senior leader   told ET on Sunday that the leaders would start visiting Bengal from April 6.
  
  The two-day state committee meeting of the party will be held in Burdwan from April 22 when the process of identifying inactive members will start. It is learnt that some of the visiting leaders would attend the two-day session.
  
  “We are constantly receiving requests from leaders of different political parties as well as from common people who want to be our members... We would not allow those who have taken our membership but don’t attend any of our programs, to be in our organisation. We will trace them and oust them from our party,” Bengal BJP president   said.
  
  Ghosh said they have decided not to call two of their invitee members — singers Bappi Lahiri and Arati Mukherjee — in their state committee meetings.
