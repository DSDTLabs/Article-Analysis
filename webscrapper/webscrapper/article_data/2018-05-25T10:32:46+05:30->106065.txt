LONDON: Your partner’s body mass index ( ) can predict your risk of developing  , according to a study that found that men are particularly more prone to developing the metabolic disease if their wife is obese.

 
 Researchers from the   and   in   examined data from 3,649 men and 3,478 women in the UK. On a global scale, 422 million adults have diabetes according to  , and it is estimated to cause 1.5 million deaths.
 
 
 “We have discovered that you can predict a person’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes based on his or her partner’s BMI,” said Jannie Nielsen, which has been published in the scientific journal Diabetologia. From other studies the researchers knew that spouses are often similar in terms of body weight, among other things because people often marry someone similar to themselves and often share dietary and exercise habits when living together.
 
 Therefore, the researchers also examined whether the heightened risk of developing type 2 diabetes of an obese woman, for example, was merely a result of her own body weight. Here the researchers found a difference between the two sexes.
 
 “If we adjusted for the women’s own weight, they did not have a heightened risk of developing type 2 diabetes as a result of their husband’s BMI. But even when we adjusted for the weight in men, they had a risk,” said Nielsen.
