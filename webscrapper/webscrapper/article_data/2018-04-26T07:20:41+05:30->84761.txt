KOLKATA: A day after allowing nomination papers filed by WhatsApp, Calcutta High Court on Wednesday dismissed a petition filed by CPM asking for acceptance of nomination papers filed through e-mail.

 
 The court said that its order allowing nine WhatsApp nominations related to a certain set of circumstances that were completely different and related to that case. CPM may challenge the order in a division bench.
 
 On Wednesday morning, senior advocate Bikash   urged Justice   to issue a directive on the state election commission to accept nominations already filed by e-mails or other electronic processes. Citing Tuesday order as a precedent, Bhattacharya argued that similar facts and circumstances necessitated similar orders.
 
 SEC secretary   argued that the facts pertaining to the earlier case were completely different. He also said that the West Bengal Panchayat Elections Act 2003 mandated either the candidate or their proposer to file nominations in person before the panchayat returning officer or BDO. Under exceptional circumstances, the SEC can intervene and instruct the returning officers to accept certain nominations. This was done in the case before, he argued.
 
 Trinamool MP and senior lawyer   drew the court’s attention to the fact that in its petition before the apex court, filing of nomination by electronic means was one among the plea. The apex court had refrained from passing any specific order in this regard.
 
 “...The prayer of the petitioner is being now dressed up in legal stripes at a stage when the electoral schedule has proceeded beyond the extended date for filing nominations,” the court observed. It then disposed the writ petition.
