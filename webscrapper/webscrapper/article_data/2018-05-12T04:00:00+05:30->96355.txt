Mumbai: For the fourth consecutive week,   (G-secs) remained unsold in Friday’s   auction, piling on the worries for the central government and the central bank. Depreciation of rupee against major currencies, rising   yields globally and multi-year high crude oil prices are prompting foreign investors to sell   in the bond market, leading to muted demand for gilts.

 In Friday’s RBI auction, G-secs worth Rs 2,919 crore remained unsold. So far in FY19, G-secs worth Rs 8,019 crore have remained unsold, called   in market parlance, translating into about 16.7% of the government’s targeted borrowing figure of Rs 48,000 crore during these four auctions, RBI data showed.
 
 So far in FY19, the government has borrowed Rs 72,000 crore. In the first half of the fiscal, the government plans to borrow nearly Rs 2.9 lakh crore, the auction calendar published in March showed. 
 
 Last week, after the third consecutive devolvement, the government and the RBI had gone on a fire-fighting mode and the central bank had announced a Rs 10,000-crore fund infusion into the banking system through open market purchase of mainly short-term papers.
 
  Although the open market operation (OMO) on Monday eased the demand-supply situation for funds in the banking system, muted demand from commercial banks owing to significantly excess SLR holding also added to the causes for the day’s devolvement in the auction, bond dealers said.
