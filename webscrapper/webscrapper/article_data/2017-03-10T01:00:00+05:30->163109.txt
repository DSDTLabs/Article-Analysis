Camaraderie between colleagues is natural, especially if they shoot for days and travel continents together. But Disha Patani’s association with   and director   has gone beyond the professional domain. She has been in touch with Chan, known for martial arts, and the director who helmed her last film.

 News is that Disha is expected to travel to   to train in martial arts at Stanley Tong’s institute at the end of the month. She will be stationed there for two weeks to master kicks and punches.“The idea was suggested to her by Jackie Chan. He knows that Disha loves to dance, is agile and loves doing action scenes too. So, when he saw her eagerness to perform action scenes, he advised her to seek professional training from Tong’s school,” says a source close to Disha.
