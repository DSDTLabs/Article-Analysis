An exuberant bunch of youngsters greeted team   and our celebrity judge for the day — Kannada actress Karunya Gowda — at the OPPO Bangalore Times Fresh Face audition at the  , South Campus. Right from the word go, they enthralled the judges and crowd with high-energy performances — from song (which included a Kannada mash up to Shape Of You) and dance to beat boxing and an incredible display of Rubik’s Cube solving in record time. Unfortunately for the young ones, strict hostel curfew ensured that many of them could not stay back for the next round of the competition.
The swiftness of Anirudh Sureshram’s fingers as he solved Rubik’s cube after cube in a minute, floored Karunya, as did Varshitha S’ spirited performance to Pakka Local, making both of them winners at this campus. Pranav Pathak’s mastery over the tabla and Ananya Das’ rendition of A Thousand Years, won them the first runners-up position. Sravanthi NDP’s powerful voice as she sang  , got her the second runner-up title. In the boys category, it was a toss-up between Harinder Singh’s bhangra jalwa and Jerin George’s beat boxing, with the judges eventually deciding to hand over the second runners-up title to both of them.
