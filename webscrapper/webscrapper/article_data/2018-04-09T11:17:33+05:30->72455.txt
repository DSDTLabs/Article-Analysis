PUNE: A 42-year-old man from   died of rabies at the Naidu Infectious Diseases hospital last week. It was the first rabies death recorded in Pune city so far this year. Last year, 10 people had died of the fatal infection in the city.

 The deceased has been identified as Prakash  , a resident of Shedgewadi in Khandala taluka (Satara district).
 
 Shedge had been bitten on his right hand by a stray dog two months ago. Though he had taken two doses of anti-rabies vaccine, he had reportedly not taken the fast-acting rabies antibodies.
 
 “It was a category-III dog bite wound. Despite sustaining a serious dog-bite wound two months ago, Shedge did not take the antibody called anti-rabies immunoglobulin — a readymade antibody that is extremely effective in deactivating the virus in a category-III dog bite injury,” a civic health official said.
 
 People bitten by stray dogs are usually injected with a fast-acting readymade antibody and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) near the wound to deactivate the rabies virus. The readymade antibodies are given to the patient for immediate protection because the vaccine generally takes 14 days to produce antibodies.
 
 As per the   (WHO) guidelines, RIG should be given for all category-III exposed patients, irrespective of the interval between the exposure and the beginning of the treatment.
 
 Shedge began developing a mild fever and breathlessness a few days before he was admitted to the Pune Municipal Corporation-run Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital on March 24. “He had also developed symptoms of rabies including hydrophobia (fear of water). He was extremely breathless at the time of admission. He succumbed to the rabies infection on March 24 at 1 am,” an official said.
 
 Rabies is a zoonotic disease (transmitted to humans from animals) that is caused by a virus. The disease affects domestic as well as wild animals and is spread to people through close contact with infectious material, usually saliva, via bites or scratches.
