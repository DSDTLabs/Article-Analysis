CHENNAI: In a novel initiative, lamp posts dating to the pre-Independence era are being given a new lease of life.These vintage cast iron lamp posts, which can still be found in a few core pockets of the city, are being shifted to light up the streets in areas closer to the sea thanks to their rust-resistant properties.While more than 200 such lamp posts have already been reinstalled at coastal hamlets in North Chennai and   in the south, another 100 would soon be moved to other neighbourhoods near the seashore.

 Officials with the   said the idea to reuse the 75-year-old lamp posts was mooted in the wake of cyclone Vardah in December 2016.“Several modern day street light poles were uprooted in the coastal areas during the cyclone last year. The cast iron lamp posts came in handy to replace the damaged poles because they do not rust,“ an official said.
 
 The civic body has so far moved 206 such lamp posts from areas in and around T Nagar to the extended areas of   and   at Ennore and hamlets in Tiruvottiyur. A few were also installed at Kottivakkam.
 
 The cast iron lamp posts, measuring five metres, are three times heavier than the new metal-sheet lamp posts which weigh only 60 kg. Officials said these old lamp posts are being removed from core areas to ensure uniformity in the design of street lights. “There may be just three such cast iron lamp posts in a street with the rest being of a different design. But we do not want these lamp posts with heritage value to end up on the scrap heap,“ an official said.“They can be used for another 50 years,“ another corporation official added.
 
 Electric street lighting was introduced for the first time in the city in 1910. The number of electric lights was gradually increased till 1925, when all street lights were replaced with electric lights. Officials said that 100 more cast iron poles are being stored near the corporation's office in   and are likely to be installed in southern suburbs closer to the sea.
