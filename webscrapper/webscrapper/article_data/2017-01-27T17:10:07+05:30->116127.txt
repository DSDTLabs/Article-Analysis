The Malayalam film industry continues to stay standstill, after the film exhibitors called for a strike on December 16, 2016. 

 On Tuesday, the Film Employees Federation of Kerala (FEFKA) had their annual general body meeting, where the strike issue was also discussed. The newly elected general secretary B Unnikrishnan said that while   cannot comment on a trade issue which involves revenue sharing, they are of the view that both parties should come to a consensus through discussions conducted in a 'democratic manner'. 'The film industry coming to a standstill is never advisable, as the film watching habit is something which has a flow. If the flow is disrupted, people will lose interest in going to theatres. We have requested everyone to not cut the flow, especially at a time when the movie industry is going through a good phase, perhaps the best in its history,' he said.
 
 However, at times, there is no other way than maintain the status quo, he hastens to add. 'Our stand in this regard is the same as that of the government, that there should be a consensus. It is usually a common practice to maintain the status quo to give both parties time to rework the terms and conditions.'
 
 The only concern of the FEFKA, he says, is the call for a government regulatory authority to solve such issues. 'All sectors, all over the world are asking for deregulation and only the film field is vying for regulation. A statutory government body with a bureaucrat as the head will never understand the nitty gritties of the industry and will only create trouble for all concerned. The associations don't seem to understand that they will lose whatever freedom they enjoy now if such an authority comes into power. Why the need for an external agency when you can resolve any issue through discussions,' he asks. 
 While it is true that the industry is going through losses, a sudden decision is impossible in this case, he adds.
