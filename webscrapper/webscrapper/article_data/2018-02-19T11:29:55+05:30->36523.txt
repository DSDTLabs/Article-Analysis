HYDERABAD: Scores of Muslims on Sunday took out a rally and staged a protest demanding that   reconstruct  , the sacred graveyard in the Islamic holy city of  . The graves in the cemetery, which is held by Muslims in high esteem, were demolished by Saudi rulers in 1926. 

 The protesters gathered at the historic   at   carrying placards and banners denouncing the Saudi Arabian government and demanding that the graves in the cemetery be restored. Many members of the Prophet's family including his daughter Bibi Fatima are laid to rest in Jannat-ul-Baqi. Muslims from around the world, particularly from Indian sub-continent, visit the cemetery and offer their respects. The protest was organised by Saviour Foundation.
 
 A Majlis was organised at the Bibi ka Alawa where the Bibi ka   is preserved. The Bibi ka Alam contains sacred relics of Bibi Fatima. They raised slogans including "Jannat-ul-Baqi is our right", "we won't give up", and "shame, shame Saudi Arabia".
 
 The protesters also displayed photos of the cemetery before and after demolition. Jannat-ul-Baqi traces its origin to the early period of Islam, perhaps to the period immediately after the migration ( ) of the Prophet (around 622 CE). The demolition of the graves started after the raise of Wahabism in early 19th century and the cemetery was completely razed to the ground after the ruling family of Saudi Arabia took control in mid 1920s.
 
 Muslims in India have been demanding the restoration of the graves in Jannat-ul-Baqi ever since they were razed. Both Sunni and Shia religious scholars are opposed to the demolition of the graves in the sacred cemetery.
 
 Saudi Arabia, which is largely influenced by Wahabism, restricts Muslims particularly from India and other parts of   from offering prayers there. Muslims in the sub-continent mostly follow the Sufi school of thought in which visiting graves and seeking forgiveness for sins is a common practice.
