A team of archaeologists have stumbled upon a centuries-old tombstone at Olakkode near Yercaud here. Dating back to around sixth or seventh century, it reportedly features inscriptions in Vatteluttu alphabet (abugida writing system) and praises a warrior, who lost his life fighting thieves to save cattle.

 Based on a tip, the team comprising Villupuram Veeraragavan, Aragalur Pon Venkatesan, Perumal, Ponnambalam, Sugavana Murugan, Mannan Veeramani, retired joint director of Tamil Nadu archaeological department R Poonkundran and stone inspector T Sundaram found the tombstone in a private estate land at Olakkode a few days ago.
 
 “We read the inscriptions with the help of Poonkundran and T Sundaram, who are expert in proto-Tamil languages,” Pon Venkatesan said.
 
 According to Poonkundran, the tombstone was  ,300-year-old and it tells about a warrior from Ayalur village who guarded cows and sheep grazing in the area. “A gang attempted to steal the cattle. The warrior fought and killed them, but he also lost his life in the battle. It has no mention about the warrior’s name or the king who ruled the place,” Pon Venkatesan said.
 
 The team believe that there could be plenty of tombstones and stone inscriptions in the region. 
 
 “We could get more information about them if we search across Yercaud,” Pon Venkatesan said.
 
 The team has urged the district administration and the archaeological department to take steps to protect the tombstone.
