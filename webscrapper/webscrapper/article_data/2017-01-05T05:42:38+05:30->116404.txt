CHANDIGARH: In a clear sign of gender equity slowly finding its feet in Punjabi society, women have left men behind in registering themselves as voters in the  's latest drive to upgrade the electoral rolls.
As many as 3.56 lakh Punjabi women enrolled themselves in last two years. This is a good 7,000 more than men. Overall, there are 1.04 crore male voters in Punjab and 92.8 lakh women voters. This is remarkable given that Punjab's sex ratio is a dismal 895 women per 1,000 men according to 2011 census. “We are delighted with the response of women considering they are reluctant at times to participate in our awareness programmes . It's a victory for woman power,“ said Punjab chief electoral officer (CEO) V K Singh. The enrolment figures have been calculated from 2015 till now and will continue till January 8.
 
 The EC figures also reveal that NRIs will yet again give Punjab elections a miss despite all parties sending their top representatives across the globe to woo them. Only 252 NRIs have enrolled themselves to cast their vote. In comparison, as many as 369 transgender people have had themselves registered with the commission.
 
 Last year, AAP ,   and SAD had sent a battery of their top-flight leaders including  ,  , Parminder Dhindsa, Prem Singh Chandumajra Sukhpal Khaira and   to the US, Canada and Australia to gain the support of NRIs. In 2012, only 46 NRIs had registered them as voters.
