NEW DELHI: Delhi University will not offer any “special” treatment to the UG aspirants coming from Central Board of Secondary Education ( ). Being a central university,   treats Class XII marks given by all   in the country equally, said a senior official in its admission committee. 

 CBSE had sought “appropriate weightage” to its students for admissions to the undergraduate programmes in DU this year so that they didn’t lose out to candidates from other state boards that “inflate” Class XII marks. 
 
 According to last year’s data, DU received nearly 50% of the 2.5 lakh applications from Delhi, followed by UP with 50,246 forms and Haryana with a little over 21,000 aspirants. While the majority of the Delhi students were from CBSE schools, the applicants from UP and Haryana came from both state and other boards.
 
 DU’s admission committee has set up a sub-committee of four college principals to look into CBSE’s request. “There has been issues with the boards from Tamil Nadu, Kerala or Andhra Pradesh among others on inflating marks. But they are not exceptions as even CBSE had been ‘inflating’ marks in the past,” said a DU official. All 32 school education boards in the country that attended a meeting called by the Union HRD ministry on April 24 have also agreed not to spike marks, he added. 
 
 The online applications for the merit-based UG programmes will start from May 22 and the same for the entrance-based programmes from May 31. While the full schedule, along with the admission policy, will be out in a few days, Open House will be conducted by DU at both north and south campuses from May 22 to clear doubts.
