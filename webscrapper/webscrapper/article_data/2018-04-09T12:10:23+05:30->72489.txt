'Hamari Paltan' director   said it was an honour for him to get to direct the late   in his debut film. Tom Alter died in September last year. 'Hamari Paltan', written and directed by Jigyasu, is the last feature film where the   will be seen on the big screen.

 On his experience of working with the acclaimed actor, Jigyasu said, "It was an honour to be able to direct Tom Alter sir in my debut film. He was an acting institute himself."
 
 "His role in the film is of a mentor to the young ones" Jigyasu said they have dedicated a line from a song to Tom Alter's character as a mentor in the film. The line is, "We are walking on the path that you led us to."
 
 Jigyasu's maiden project revolves around children from two separate backgrounds who become friends through a game. These children start a movement by getting inspired by a retired professor. The director said his aim was to make a film for children.
 
 "There aren't many films made for children. Good films are made but they aren't able to get a good release to reach the right audience, which is kids."
 
 The trailer shows the late Tom Alter as the retired professor who teaches children the right ways to keep the environment clean and healthy, while   plays the politician against the movement started by the children.
 
 The film will release on April 27.
