NEW DELHI:   has asked its personnel deployed with   vans to not carry   while on duty. 

 
 In a circular issued to the PCR units, senior officers said that a cop seen using a mobile phone while on duty in PCR vans forms a   about the alertness of cops among the public.
 
 In the order issued by DCP (PCR)  , inspectors and ACPs deployed with the PCR have been asked to ensure that the order is implemented immediately. DCP Arya said that everyone except the inspector in-charge has been asked to stop carrying mobile phones on duty.
 
 The cops have been asked to deposit the mobile phones with their reporting unit before boarding the PCR vans. According to senior police officers, the vans not only act as patrol vehicles but also as emergency response unit, including an ambulance. Due to this, the cops on duty are expected to be alert about the situation around them.
 
 “It was found that most of the time, the policemen on duty are engrossed in something on their mobile phones due to which they have the possibility of missing out on situations that might require quick reaction. Each policeman on PCR duty has a fixed duty hour, after which they can use their mobile phones,” said a police officer.
 
 The senior officers have also directed the PCR staffers to conduct a patrol more often so that they are more visible. Parking the PCR vehicle on a corner gives the public an impression about the agility of the cops. PCR staffers including women cops have also been directed to visit areas like parks and dark spots for women to keep an eye on the activities of ruffians in the area.
