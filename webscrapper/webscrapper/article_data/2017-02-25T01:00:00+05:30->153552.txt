 Kohli, who had girls swooning over his chocolate-boy looks in his debut film, has changed gears with ' '. The actor has shed his boy-next-door look and donned a completely new avatar.

' ' is a stark opposite. I had to look like a college boy for which I shed weight, which alone took me five months. But when I saw the result, I felt it was all worth it.”
