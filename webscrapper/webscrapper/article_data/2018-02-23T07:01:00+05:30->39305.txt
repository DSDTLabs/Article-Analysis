GURUGRAM: In a move to decongest busy areas in the city, the   has issued a list of over 96 buildings — including Unitech Cyber Park in Sector 39, ILT Trade Centre,  , Omaxe celebration mall, JMD Megapolis in Sector 48, DLF Corporate Park on  , JMD Empire Sqaure, First India Place, Millennium Plaza and Time Tower — where free   facility will be set up.

 “These buildings have been given property tax exemptions in lieu of the free parking facility. Most busy stretches, especially MG Road and Sohna Road, are highly congested owing to illegal parking,” said YS Gupta, joint commissioner, MCG. Sources said most mall owners have agreed to the MCG’s plan as long as they were getting the exemption. However, the MCG had announced a similar list of around 45 buildings, which were supposed to provide free parking facility, but residents had complained that these malls had refused to do it.
 
 An MCG official said that there were three types of parking lots in malls and official buildings, and the free parking facility might be available in only one of those categories. “Free parking is available only in the area where the developer has taken a property exemption. On the same premises, it is possible that the developer has paid taxes for other parking areas, which won’t be free,” said Gupta.
