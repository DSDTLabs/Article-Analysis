LUDHIANA: The Ludhiana police on Sunday arrested six persons, including two cops, for snatching hawala money from an employee of a company in Kochar Market. 

 The accused were identified as assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Gurkewal Singh and head constable Sarabjeet Singh, both posted at Model Town police station, Kamal Kishore, Money Kumar, both residents of Harnam Nagar,   of Model Town Extension and Surjeet   of Amar Nagar.
 
 Police officials said Jaideep Singh of Gujarat -- who at present lives on Pakhowal Road -- had lodged a complaint with division number five police that on April 29 around 1.15pm, three unidentified persons, two in police uniform, had come to his house and beat him up. He said they took away Rs 4 lakh from him, which had been given to him by his manager Patel Upinder. 
 
 ADCP (III) Surinder Lamba said during investigation and from the footage of   cameras, it came to light that the amount was Rs 20 lakh and not Rs 4 lakh as claimed by the complainant. He said the complainant hid the exact amount as it was hawala money and normally such cases weren't reported.
