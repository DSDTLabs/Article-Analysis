KOZHIKODE:  's uncle   resigned from his job at   mouthpiece   on Tuesday, a day after the party's Vannarkkandi branch committee decided against renewing his party membership.

 Sreejith, who had been working in Deshabhimani from 2001 as a correspondent in Nadapuram and later in the newspaper's Vadakara bureau, was last year shifted to the advertising section of the newspaper as marketing executive.
 
 In his resignation letter to Deshabhimani general manager, Sreejith said that he was resigning as attempts were being made to de fame the newspaper by linking the daily with him at a time when he, along with other family members, are engaged in the fight to secure justice for Jishnu.
 
 Meanwhile, the party local unit's de cision to take disciplinary action against Sreejith has put the party on the defensive with the CPM Kozhikode district secretary P Mohanan sa ying on Tuesday that the party has not taken any disciplinary action against Sreejith.
 
 Party sources said the Vannarakandi branch committee's decision not to renew his membership during the ongoing membership scrutiny process will have to be approved by the party local committee and area committee.
 
 Meanwhile, Sreejith's father K K Kumaran, a local leader of the CPM at Vannarakandi who had suffered serious injuries in a political violence in 1997, said that the party move against Sreejith was unjust.
 
 “The local party leadership behaved in an unjust manner. The move against Sreejith was taken is in a haste and was aimed at taking revenge,“ he said.
 
 CPM Nadapuram area committee member P P Chathu also denied any disciplinary action against Sreejith but said that discussions are going on in the party on the stand taken by Sreejith, but no final decision has been taken in that regard.
 
 The local party committee had taken the view that Sreejith was behind the agitation staged by Jishnu's mother Mahija in Thiruvananthapuram which put the CPM-led state government and the party in a fix.
