 By Suresh's account Kangana is a fast learner. "She is progressing well but has to accomplish a lot in a short period so I had a meeting with her director to get the brief right. Among other things, he also told me that she might have some scenes of bareback riding which is riding without a saddle. It's difficult in a short period of time but we hope to achieve it. We train together for 30 minutes a day at the Mahalaxmi race course amateur riders club. Kangana has already done about four rides with me," the trainer told Mirror.
