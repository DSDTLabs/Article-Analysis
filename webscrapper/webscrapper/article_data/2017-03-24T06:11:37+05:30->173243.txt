The   (UPSEE) has received the   in the past five years for its BTech courses.   at the engineering colleges are believed to be the reasons behind the trend.

 In 2012, over 1.6 lakh applications were received for BTech courses but that number has dwindled to 1.2 lakh applications in 2017. “The demand for engineers in low and the industry is hiring fewer so the number of applications is also low,” said vice chancellor Vinay Kumar Pathak.
 
 The figures shared by UPSEE coordinator Prof Kuldeep Sahai reveal that the highest number of applications, 1.7 lakh, in the past five years were received in 2015 for BTech and BTech (agriculture).
 
 “Out of the 620 colleges affiliated to Dr  , there are only 100 where an engineering aspirant would want to study. Most of the colleges fail to provide placement and infrastructure to the students,” said AKTU spokesperson Ashish Mishra. He said the university has strictly restricted private colleges from direct admissions. Only students who have cleared entrance examination are allowed admission. The decision has been taken so that the seats remain vacant in such colleges and they automatically request for closure.
 
 The university has caught many colleges showing fake admissions in BTech to take scholarship benefits from the social welfare department. To give quality education and better placement, AKTU is keeping a tab on all institutes.
