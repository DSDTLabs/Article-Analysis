Without hiding his angst over the way he has been sidelined after Akhilesh took charge of the party, Shivpal reiterated his allegiance to Mulayam. 

 "I will not desert Netaji ( ) till my last breath. I have told the chief minister that I am ready to accept everything except humiliation of Netaji," he said.
 
 "People, who have achieved great heights because of Netaji, have only behaved with him in a very disrespectful manner, which pains me," Shivpal told the gathering. "There are many ministers in the cabinet who only believe in getting themselves clicked on cameras. Whereas those who had worked hard, be it   or Narad Rai and even I have been dumped," he said.
 
 "When Netaji's position as party chief was usurped, I had told the chief minister that I am ready to sacrifice everything, including the right of ticket distribution if Netaji was allowed to continue as national president of the party."
 
 Shivpal expressed his displeasure over the allotment of tickets in which his loyalists were denied tickets. "I will campaign for those candidates, who have been denied tickets by the party and are contesting as Independents. I will campaign and garner support for them," he said amid slogans like "Shivpal tum sangharsh karo, hum tumhare saath hain (We are with you in the fight)."
 
 Like Mulayam, Shivpal, too, opposed the   alliance. "What was the situation of the Congress, it could not even win four seats, now it have been given 105 seats... where will our men go now?" he asked.
