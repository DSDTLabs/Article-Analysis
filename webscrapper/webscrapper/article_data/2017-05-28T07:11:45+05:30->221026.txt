MUMBAI:  , the joint ventures partner of   in ICICI Lombard General Insurance, is selling 12.2% in the Indian non-life   major to three entities for nearly Rs 2,500 crore.The three funds which are buying into the company are Red Bloom Investment, an arm of global private equity major Warburg Pincus, Tamarind Capital, a company owned by the Clermont Group of Singapore and IIFL Special Opportunities Fund, managed by the IndiaInfoline group.

 The deal values ICICI Lombard, one of the country's leading general insure rs, at about Rs 20,300 crore, a release from the company said. At current valuations, Red Bloom, which is set to pick up 9% in the company would have to pay a little over Rs 1,800 crore while Tamarind Capital and IIFL Special Opportunities Fund, each buying 1.59% in the company, will individually pay about Rs 325 crore. In October 2015, after India allowed foreign players to hike stakes in insurance companies to 35% from 26% earlier, Fairfax, owned by India-born Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa, had bought an additional 9% in ICICI Lombard for about Rs 1,550 crore, valuing the company at about Rs 17,200 crore.
 
 Watsa is understood to be buying a strategic stake in the nonlife company promoted by Kamesh Goyal, former CEO of Bajaj Allianz in India. Under current rules, an entity holding more than 10% in an insurance venture can not hold stake in another insurance company in the country. In January, Reuters had reported that Watsa was keen to dilute his stake in ICICI Lombard to buy a stake in another insurance venture.
 
 After this stake sale, ICICI Bank will hold 63.31% in the general insurer while   will hold 22.13%, the release said.
 
 Employees hold about 2.38% in the company. There are talks that ICICI Lombard is planning to list on the bourses through an IPO, which could make it the first non-life insurer in India to go public. As on March 31, 2016, the company had issued over 1.58 crore policies and settled over 16.2 lakh claims, it said.
