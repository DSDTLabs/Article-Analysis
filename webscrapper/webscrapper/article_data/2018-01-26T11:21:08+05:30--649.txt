JAIPUR: In a candid conversation with author and journalist  , filmmaker   spoke about how she turned down an offer to direct a   film.

 At a JLF session, ‘Mira Nair: The Personal and the Political’, on Thursday, she said, “I turned down the offer as I was deep into directing ‘Vanity Fair’. I lost my mother-in-law who was like a mother due to medical malpractice in New York. I was deep in melancholy. But at that time, I read ‘The Namesake’, the beautiful novel by  . It was also about the death of a parent. I then decided to make film on it. I then got an offer to direct Harry Potter 4.”
 
 She added that she asked her son about the decision that she should take as her son was obsessed with Harry Potter. “I asked my 14-year-old son about it. He told me there are many good directors who can make Harry Potter, but there is only one director who can make Namesake,” she said.
