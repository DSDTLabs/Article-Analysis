MUMBAI - The   will sell sovereign bonds on August 10 via   (OMO) in the third such sale this financial year to drain excess   from the banking system.
 
  Based on the current assessment of prevailing and evolving liquidity conditions, the   has decided to conduct sale of government securities for an aggregate amount of Rs 10,000 crore, the central bank said in a statement on Friday. The OMO is a liquidity management tool used by the central bank.
  
  Earlier in July, it conducted two OMO sales of Rs 10,000 crore each.
  
  The monetary authority has been withdrawing cash via such daily operations as it aims to maintain a “neutral liquidity” stance. The system is still sloshing with excess funds of about Rs 3 lakh crore.
  
  “This OMO should ideally send bond yields higher pushing prices down. But, it is unlikely to happen amid muted credit growth, with banks investing more in government bonds,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, Associate Director at India Ratings.
  
  “Also, the market is expecting another quarter percent policy rate cut from the RBI, which in turn is helpful for offsetting any expected yield rise,” he said.
  
  The benchmark bond yielded 6.45% Friday, a tad lower than its closing a day earlier.
  
  Bank loan growth has been at more than 7%, show the latest RBI data. This is way below the average double-digit growth seen in the past few years.
