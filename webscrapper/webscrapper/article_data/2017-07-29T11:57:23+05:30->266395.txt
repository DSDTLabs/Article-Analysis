SALEM: Film director  , who is also chief coordinator of Tamil nationalist party Naam  , was on Friday booked for hate speech after he lambasted both the central and state governments for their inaction over many issues at a public meeting in the city earlier this month.

 The Hasthampatty police registered a case against Seeman under Sections 124 A (sedition), 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 153 B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the IPC. 
 
 The case relates to a public meeting organised by his party cadre in the city on July 4. “While addressing the gathering, he slammed both the central and state governments for not taking action on many issues. His speech often instigates riots between two communities,” the police said. They said the July 4 speech by Seeman was intended to affect the solidarity between the central and the state governments. 
 
 The police said they were in the process of gathering video footages of the meeting.
