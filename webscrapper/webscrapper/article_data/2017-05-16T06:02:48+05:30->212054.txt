NEW DELHI: The Indian women’s cricket team scaled several new peaks on Monday when openers   and   put on a world-record 320-run opening stand during a mammoth 249-run victory over   in the   ODI match in  , Potchesfroom.

 It’s the biggest opening stand in ODIs not just for women but even for men. India scored 358/2 and Ireland, in reply, were all out for 109 in 40 overs, handing India’s women their biggest victory in terms of runs in ODIs.
 
 Deepti took just 160 balls to score 188 runs — the secondhighest individual score of all time in women’s cricket — while Poonam scored 109 during their record stand, which lasted 45.3 overs.
 
 Deepti, who hit 27 fours and two sixes, is now India's highest scorer in women’s cricket, second only to the all time highest of 229 not out, scored by Australia’s Belinda Clark against Denmark.
 
 Deepti broke the Indian record scripted by Jaya Sharma who had scored 138 not out against Pakistan women in Karachi in 2005.
 
 The Indian women’s cricket team had not breached the 300-run mark in a one-dayer before this, with their previous highest being 298/2 against the West Indies in 2004.
 
 Before Deepti and Poonam’s marathon stand, the record for the highest partnership in women's cricket belonged to England’s Sarah Taylor and Caroline Atkins, who had put on 268 for the first wicket against   in 2008.
 
 With four wins from four matches, India are now the only unbeaten side in the tournament with wins over South Africa, Ireland (twice) and Zimbabwe.
