CHENNAI:  's   (south) district secretary   died in Chennai on Friday morning after a brief illness, the party said. Periasamy was 78. He was the party's district secretary since 1986 and was elected to the assembly twice in 1989 and 1996.

 Periyasamy died at 7am in a private hospital in the city. He is survived by his wife, daughter and Tuticorin MLA Geetha Jeevan, a minister in the DMK gov ernment between 2006 and 2011, and son N PJagan.
 
 DMK president   had once referred to Periyasamy as his 'murattu bakthan' (fierce loyalist). While Periyasamy remained a chieftain, jealously guarding his southern turf, he never got a ministerial berth.DMK working president M K Stalin, MDMK founder Vaiko and others condoled his death.
 
 Stalin paid homage to the party leader in the city, other senior leaders are expected to pay homage in Tuticorin. “He was close to Thalaivar (Karunanidhi) and to me. His death is a big loss for the party. I convey my condolences to family members,“ said Stalin in a statement.
 
 Vaiko too visited the hospital before the DMK leader's body was taken to his native vil lage, where public can pay homage. “Periyasamy was a longtime friend. His death is a big loss for DMK in the southern districts,“ said Vaiko. Unlike last December, when DMK members resisted his attempts to visit Karunanidhi in hospital, there was no opposition to Vaiko paying homage to Periyasamy.
 
 The DMK deferred all programmes as a tribute to the departed party leader.
