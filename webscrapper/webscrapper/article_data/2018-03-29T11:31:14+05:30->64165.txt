NAGPUR: Calling the   government’s recent   a “haphazard decision”, different city associations demanded an extension from the state for implementing the ban.

 In a press meet held on Wednesday, Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA), Packaged Drinking Water Association, Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce ( ) and other organizations stated that the economy will get rapidly damaged without plastic.
 
 “At least 5 lakh families will get affected,” said former VIA chief  . In a letter to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, VIA said a state-level committee should be formed for coordinating Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016.
 
 Representatives of city-based packaged drinking water association said water pouches should be exempted from the ban. “They provide hygienic water to the lower strata of the society. When milk pouches are exempted, why not water which is a more important commodity?” they said.
