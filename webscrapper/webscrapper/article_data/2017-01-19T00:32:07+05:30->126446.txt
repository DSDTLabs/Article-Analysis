Indore: District administration’s ‘No Helmet No Patrol’ rule seems to have failed to incur desired results as most of patrol pumps in city have started selling patrol to motorist who do not wear helmet. The administration had earlier directed petrol pump owners not to give petrol to helmet-less two-wheeler riders under section 3/7 of Essential Commodities Act. The rule was brought in effect in 2015 after administration found few abiders of compulsory helmet rules. With this the ratio of helmet-less two-wheeler riders, however, fell once commuters started facing hardships at fuel stations and the traffic police started issuing challans.  Officials with district administration said that the rule is still in effect. “When the rule was imposed several two-wheeler riders simply borrowed the headgear from other customers coming to the pump. If a rider has a helmet then patrol pump operators need to give them him/her petrol. Rider need to wear a helmet on our premises, but once they move out it becomes the duty of the police to keep a check. “There are times when a biker simply removes the helmet after leaving the pump,” they said.
