Panaji: The ferry service along the busy Panaji-Betim route shut down for two hours on Tuesday as both the ferries plying the route developed snags.  While one ferry has been off-service since Monday, the second didnâ€™t start on Tuesday as dust affected its diesel flow. The second resumed operation around 2.30pm, after repairs, while the former will on Wednesday.  The route is one of the busiest in the state, and around 10,000 use the service everyday. Additionally, it also sees two-wheeler traffic comprising 5,000 bikes a day, and also several cars.  The service has seen its popularity rise since office-goers prefer to avoid the perennial traffic problems that plague the Porvorim slope due to the construction of the third Mandovi bridge.
