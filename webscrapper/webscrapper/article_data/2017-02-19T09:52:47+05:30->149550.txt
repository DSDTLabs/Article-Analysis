AURANGABAD: Mayor   on Friday said he would soon call a special general body meeting to decide on the proposed   hike.

 “The proposal needs to be discussed in detail and that is possible only in a meeting dedicated for it,” he said. The proposal was earlier placed before the routine general body meeting wherein members could not spare enough time to express their views on the issue.
 
 BJP corporator   said most of the corporators were against the hike but they are equally concerned about the pitiable financial condition of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation ( ).
 
 “We are not going to allow the municipal body to raise taxes but at the same time we want to discuss on how the authorities could generate necessary funds. A special general body would throw light on this issue,” he said.
 
 Thorat said there are many properties in the city that are out of reach of the authorities. “If the civic body succeeds in bringing them under the tax net, we would not need to hike the rates,” he said.
 
 There are about 1.75 lakh registered properties within the municipal limits but officials believe that about 60,000 properties are still out of reach of the authorities.
 
 Meanwhile, sources said some of the corporators — annoyed over the slow pace of developmental work and non-availability of funds — are in favour of marginal hike in taxes. But others, who believe that increased rates would lead to additional burden on tax payers, said the municipal authorities should carry out an assessment of new properties to generate funds.
 
 On Friday, standing committee chairman   had forwarded the proposal to the general body and it was widely anticipated that it would be rejected unanimously. The cash-strapped AMC has placed the proposal in standing committee seeking 20-25% rise in the existing tariff.
