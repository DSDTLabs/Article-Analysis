BENGALURU: Over the last decade, though budgetary allocations have been made for   in the city every year, nothing much changed in reality. However, there appears a sliver of hope this time, with the South Western Railway saying some basic work can begin soon.

 The only thing that differentiates this year’s budgetary allocation from the past is that it’s coming in the backdrop of an MoU entered into by the state government and the Railways in January, detailing the project.
 
 However, experts feel that it is highly unlikely for the Railways to begin work on a large-scale until a special purpose vehicle (SPV) is created for the project. Prakash Mandoth, member of the zonal railway users’ consultative committee (ZRUCC), said, “Until the SPV is created and a company is formed by the state and the Railways to execute the project, like it’s being done for   in all cities, we shouldn’t expect too much from the announcement.”
 
 However, the Bengaluru division of the South Western Railways (SWR) says there are ways to start replacing 27 existing suburban trains and build the coaching terminal/maintenance shed for suburban trains in Banaswadi. Sanjiv Kumar Agarwal, division railway manager (DRM) of Bengaluru said: “In the MoU it was decided that a committee comprising all stakeholders will be formed. The committee will have powers to initiate some of the basic works required to take up the project before the formation of the company.”
 
 Accordingly, he said, works like procurement of the 27 mainline electric multiple units (MEMU) rakes to replace the old diesel-run engines can be initiated. “We had already requested Rs 360 crore in funds to replace old rakes. And with the allocation, 27 rakes will be replaced. We will decide on floating the tender to procure these sets of trains, once the fund is deposited in the Railways’ account,” Agarwal added.
 
 PROBLEM POINT
 
 However, one crucial bottleneck to the project is yet to be resolved. The draft policy on suburban rail suggests that the Centre and state pay 20% each and the rest be loans with the state as the guarantor. The Siddaramaiah government, however, has suggested that the funding pattern be 50:50. The two stakeholders are yet to resolve this issue.
 
 FOR BETTER CONNECTIVITY
 
 * According to a RITES study, the suburban railway system will connect places within Bengaluru and its suburbs (between 30 and 100km from city)
 
 * Estimated to ferry 25 lakh people by 2030 
 
 * At present SWR ferries 1.5 lakh people around Bengaluru
 
 * There are 61 stations within 100km of Bengaluru
