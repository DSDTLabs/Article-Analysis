KOCHI: The 24-hour strike called by  ' Association was complete and people had to rely on   services to reach their destinations. The strike partially affected normal life as 1,300 buses skipped services on Tuesday. People who were on their way to Vypeen were stranded at High Court junction and the rush was visible at Vyttila hub when passengers rushed to get into KSRTC buses. 

 Rail passengers did not face much trouble as they relied on the prepaid autorickshaw services at the station compound. Since the strike was announced days ago, residents from faraway places chose to stay at home. In the morning KSRTC stand did not see much of a rush, but it changed as the day progressed.
 
 "People might have used other mode of transportation to reach offices and that's why there was no rush in the morning. But in the evening, they used KSRTC buses. We had a good collection on Tuesday due to the private bus strike," said a KSRTC official.
 
 Online taxi operators also had a good time operating many trips. Nitin Nair, general manager of Uber Kerala, said compared to their average trips each day, there was a slight bump in the numbers due to bus strike.
 
 "The boat service connecting Ernakulam boat jetty and   at 4pm and 4:20 pm did not arrive and there were 100 passengers awaiting with their ticket. There were more people waiting outside for a ticket. In such a circumstance, where other modes of transportation are unavailable, more alternatives should be provided," said MM Ashraf, a member of  . tnn
