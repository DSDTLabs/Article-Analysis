MOSCOW:   is set to manufacture at least 140 helicopters in co-operation with   (HAL) at the latter’s facility in Bengaluru.

 This is part of the joint venture production of Russian helicopters as part of the Make in India campaign.
 
 In May this year, India and   had entered a joint venture, at 51:49 share, to manufacture the aircraft in the country.
 
 Rostec is a Russian corporation set up in 2007 to facilitate development, production and export of high-tech industrial products designed for civilian and military applications.
 
 Its CEO,  , said the production of the Ka-226T helicopters in India will be implemented by fully transferring manufacturing technologies.
 
 “Russia has transferred 100% in-depth manufacturing technologies to India, allowing Indian defence enterprises to set up full-scale production of their defence products,” he told a news conference at Zhukovskiy, nearly 40km from Moscow where the six-day   and Space Salon MAKS 2017 concluded on July 23.
 
 India is already manufacturing Su-30   aircraft and T-90S tanks and is overhauling RD-33 aircraft engines with Russian licences.
 
 As part of the joint venture between the two countries, Russia will deliver Ka-226T helicopters within two years and, in all likelihood, increase the chopper production output in India, Chemezov said.
 
 “The project for localisation of Ka-226T helicopter production in India is currently implemented with HAL. It (HAL) has significant experience in the transfer of Russian technologies to India,” he said.
