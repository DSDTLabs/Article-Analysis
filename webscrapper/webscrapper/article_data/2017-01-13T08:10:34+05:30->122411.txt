PUNE: Citizens and environment activists will form a human chain near  's main gate on January 14 to protest against the proposed felling of 29 trees along   for its widening. 

 The protest will be held from 9am to 10am. The participants will spread awareness about the need to protect the city's tree cover - a dismal 1.5 trees for every citizen, much below the prescribed 28 trees per person. This is the third protest organized by activists since 2015 to prevent the felling of trees on this road. 
 
 More than hundred tamarind, mango, ashok, banyan, gulmohar, jacaranda, rain and neem trees line the Aundh road. Some of them are over a hundred years old. The   has planned to bring down 29 of them.
 
 According to the original plan of the civic body announced in May 2015, about 105 trees had been identified for cutting to widen the road for the proposed Bus Raid Transit System (BRTS) corridor. The total number has been brought down since then, under public pressure.
 
 The protesters have sent a letter to the municipal commissioner, Kunal Kumar, opposing the tree-cutting notice pasted on the trees on Ganeshkhind Road.
 
 The letter requested Kumar to call a public hearing for the proposal. It also mentioned that the city should not opt for the wrong option of cutting trees and to make space for motor vehicles, resulting in more pollution and unsafe conditions for pedestrians.
 
 Elaborating on their reason for protesting, Vaishali Patkar of Aundh Vikas Mandal and   said, "We are not against development. But when infrastructure and buildings along the road are not being demolished for road widening, these silent trees should not face the axe."
 
 Activists have also alleged that the civic body had been non-responsive to all PILs and RTIs filed by them on the tree-felling plan.
