AURANGABAD: The city police have booked five people, including four of a family, on charges of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy, after they allegedly forged documents for obtaining a loan of Rs 26.58 lakh for goat farming and later diverting the money.

 The alleged cheating came to light after the suspects tried making an insurance claim on the project that to a great extent remained only on papers. The verification team of the insurance company on finding about their alleged cheating not only busted their attempt to make an insurance claim, but also brought the matter to the notice of the bank that issued the loan.
 
 As per the complaint lodged by Central Bank of India, Gulmandi branch manager  , the suspects in October 2016 obtained a loan of Rs 26.58 lakh from the bank for setting up a goat farm and developing grazing land for the goats.
 
 The suspects instead of purchasing the number of goats mentioned in the proposal put forth for obtaining the loan, purchased only 58 goats. Banerjee in his complaint said the suspects not only diverted the money they obtained as loan for other purposes, but also defaulted on the repayment of loan.
 
 The police maintained that primary investigation has revealed that the suspects sketched out the plan very minutely. Accordingly, they obtained a loan and tried getting an insurance claim on the goat farming project.
 
 Investigating officer and head constable   said, “We are collecting the documents the suspects had submitted while seeking loan as well as while contesting insurance claim. They would be arrested once the evidences are in place.”
