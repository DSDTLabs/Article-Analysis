RANCHI: The   of   at the Morhabadi campus will soon be open for students 24X7. 

 The vice-chancellor has assured the   (PGSU) of the university that the library would start operating round the clock, from March this year.
 
 President of PGSU,   said, “The students have been demanding a library which is open 24X7 for a very long time and when we have been able to form the students’ union after a gap of nine years, we finally decided to take up the matter with the authorities.”
 
 The central library is the centre point for thousands of students to access free of cost study materials. Khatri said, “There are many students who belong to really poor financial background and cannot afford buying books. For such students, this library is the only source of knowledge.”
 
 There are many students who work part time to finance their education and support their family at the same time. “If the library is open all through the day and night, these students will get enough time to spend in the library and study, irrespective of the time.” Khatri said.
 
 Once the library starts functioning round the clock, the students pursuing research will also be benefited as they will get to spend more time at the library to work on their projects.
 
 Vice-chancellor of Ranchi University, Ramesh Pandey said, “We will try to introduce the new timings by the month of March. But before that we have to make some preparations, such as providing extra benches and lighting inside the library and arranging for proper security for students who come to study at night.”
 
 The students are also demanding that the library stocks up on recent editions of books and provides free Wi-Fi.
 
 Arvind Kumar, a student said, “The books in the library are very old and outdated. It is high time that the university gets new books for us.”
 
 He added, “When the whole country is going hi-tech, the university should also provide free access to Wi-Fi for us even if its for selected educational websites.”
