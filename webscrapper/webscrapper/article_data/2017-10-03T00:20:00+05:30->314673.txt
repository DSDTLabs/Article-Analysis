Mohali: Since the August rain that flooded the streets and choked sewerage, the city’s roads have been caving in one after the other. On Monday, the surface at the Phase-VII traffic lights sank, disrupting traffic for a few hours until cops diverted it.

 The road from Phase VII to 3B2 was repaired only last month, after remaining blocked for 10 days. It has caved in again after sewerage pipes burst after being choked for days and made the base soil wet enough to sag. Sources in the civic body say the authorities knew that the section was vulnerable, yet they waited for monsoon to do the damage.
 
 An official in the Mohali Municipal Corporation said: “Road repair is never done properly. Before the job, the MC’s teams should first fix all the leaking pipes.” Local resident Amarjeet Singh said: “The cave-in is evidence that the construction contractor used poor material and technique. The airport road had the same fate.”
 
 The residents and municipal councillors of many wards have complained of slow repair. For more than a week in August, this tardiness blocked the town’s busiest stretches—the Forest Bhawan light point in Sector 68 and the road to the PCA Stadium. For more than a week, there’s no worker but only fencing around the airport road near Radha Soami Bhawan and the Nature Park bridge in Phase 8. 
 
 Phase-VII resident Gurpreet Singh said: “The municipal corporation has no plan or priority. I don’t know how they are repairing this road the same day but, last month, they took more than two weeks to fill a pit that an uprooted tree had made at the Phase-VII traffic lights. After fencing the roads under repair, most of the times the MC skips informing the cops, who come to know only when the traffic halts and people ring them up.”
