 The BJP's social engineering that focuses on nonYadav OBCs has changed the way OBCs that missed the Mandal mileage, are being addressed and looked at.
 
 Sensing electoral bene fits from empowering the politically isolated non-Yadav OBCs, parties wooed them hard. Several candidates are from these castes and many could win. People, even from the dominant upper castes, have changed their attitude towards them. The BJP has fielded around 150 OBCs.
 
 Among the non-Yadav OBCs prominent are Lodhs,  ,  , Rajbhars, Chauhans and kevats. The   are the only ones who've experienced some uplift after their caste leader Kalyan Singh became CM.

 This is the first time that the non-Yadav OBCs have emerged a decisive vote bank as they have shown the resolve to demand their share of the development pie and eagerness to end the “disproportionate empha sis“ on Yadavs.
 
 Among the prominent BJP candidates in the fray is party   Morcha chief Dara Singh Chauhan, a Nonia, against Abbas, son of Mukhtar Ansari at Ghosi.Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party president Om Prakash Rajbhar, contesting as a BJP alliance candidate from Jahoorabad, appears to have polarised the Rajbhar community . BJP state president Keshav Prasad Maurya is seen as the architect of the KoriKurmi tilt towards the BJP.
