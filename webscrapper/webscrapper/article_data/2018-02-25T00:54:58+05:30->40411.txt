GREATER NOIDA: Vehicles passed two toll plazas without paying tax for over an hour in   and   as members of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) protested after one of their leaders was charged.

 Travellers passed the toll plazas without paying anything from 11.30am to 1pm as BKU members forced the workers to leave the kiosks. The protesters left the place after a police team headed by the SDM of Jewar, Rajpal Singh, pacified them.
 
 “Om Prakash Chaudhary, the general secretary of the Meerut mandal of BKU, had called up officials at the Jewar   and informed them Jaiveer Nagar was a BKU member and he should not be stopped. He was allowed to pass the toll plaza in Jewar but was stopped in Bajna,” said Sanjay Kasana, a BKU leader.
 
 Farmers whose land had been acquired for the toll plazas had been demanding since 2012 that they should not be charged. BKU members have been exiting the toll plazas for free as part of a mutual understanding until a conclusion is reached.
