Cleared 320   Panaji: With very few shops registering themselves, the Corporation of City of Panaji (CCP) has issued notices to shopkeepers and street vendors asking them to comply with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. CCP commissioner Ajit Roy on Wednesday said that in the coming days CCP officials will be going around the city to inspect and survey shops found selling plastic.    In October 2017, CCP had issued a public notice asking traders and shops dispensing plastic carry bags to register themselves. Stores and shopkeepers have also been banned from dispensing plastic bags below 50 microns under the new rules.    “Most shopkeepers have not registered with us. They should have registered. We have now sent notices because it is illegal to sell plastic without registration,” Roy said.    Shopkeepers will have to pay a monthly fee of Rs 4,000, or an annual fee of Rs 48,000 to the civic body if they want to sell or dispense plastic bags. “If they don’t register and if we find them using plastic, then CCP can suspend their trade licence. While issuing or renewing trade licences we will be adding a condition that they cannot sell plastic bags without registering,” a CCP official said.    The CCP will charge Rs 4,000 from the shopkeepers for the first three months till March 31 and from April 1 full annual fees of Rs 48,000 will be taken at the time of renewal of trade licences.    “If shopkeepers and vendors are found selling goods in plastic without getting registered themselves then they will be penalised under Section 45 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1996, which mandates imprisonment for five years with fine extending up to Rs 1 lakh or both; in case failure or contravention continues then additional fine of Rs 5,000 will be levied daily,” the CCP notice reads.    The notice is in compliance with the directives of the ministry of environment forest and climate change.
