SURAT: The city unit of   started its preparations for 2017 assembly elections by holding a party workers’ meeting at   Auditorium at Pal here on Thursday evening. The Congress workers were told at the meeting attended by party affairs in-charge of Gujarat   and state unit party president Bharatsinh Solanki that they had a good chance to bounce back to power thanks to the changed circumstances in the state, provided they stay united. 

 Gehlot said it was due to Congress that the country has made all-round development. “BJP talks untruth and nothing else. It’s time that Congress workers got together and ensured that our candidates won,” he said. 
 
 Solanki called chief minster Vijay Rupani the biggest anti-national. China, which has intruded into another country’s territory close to Sikkim, is blocking Indian pilgrims from going to Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and the chief minister plans to sign an MoU with it, the Congress leader said. 
 
 “When Ashok Gehlot was chief minister of Rajasthan, he had sanctioned Rs125 crore for cattle grazing. However, the BJP rulers there now are hands in gloves with cow killers and call themselves cow protectors” Solanki said. 
 
 He too asked around 800 Congress workers at the meeting to stay united to ensure Congress’ victory.
 
 Solanki told TOI, “We have improved a lot compared to last assembly elections in Surat. Look at the number of our councillors in Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). We missed controlling Rajkot Municipal Corporation just by a whisker. Our vote share has gone up quite a bit. The anti-incumbency factor and people’s anger against the ruling BJP will help us win the elections this time.” Congress that had 10 councillors in 114-member SMC earlier now has more than 30. Most of the Congress councillors are Patidars.
