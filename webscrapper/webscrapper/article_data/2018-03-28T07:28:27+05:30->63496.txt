KOLKATA: This year, the Kolkatans are spending more on vegetables, thanks to a slump in production in neighbouring states like Jharkhand, Bihar and Odisha. Every day, trucks load of vegetables are leaving for these states from the haats of rural Bengal, leaving  .

 
  
  
 There is a difference of Rs 10-Rs 15 in all vegetable prices compared to what they were last year. Moreover, the retailers are making most of this crisis by pushing vegetable prices up, leaving yawning gap between the wholesale and retail price.
 
 “The price of vegetables will keep burning holes in your pockets till the end of April first week. After that, the price is bound to dip, with rise in 
  in both Bengal and its neighbouring states. The bhendi price could have crashed to Rs 3-Rs 5 per kg if the bulk of it was not transported in as many as 150 trucks to Bihar and Jharkhand from   in South 24 Parganas,” said  , president of   Market Vendors’ Association and a member of the government task force to control rise in prices of commodities.
 
 Another reason for the price rise is the high price of potato. The potato price (Jyoti variety) is Rs 14-Rs 15 per kg this year, compared to Rs 6-Rs 7 per kg last year. “If potato price is low, the demand for other vegetable remains low. But higher price of potato trigger a high demand for other vegetables in the market,” added Dey.
 
 But what is worrying is the gap between wholesale and retail price of vegetables. The cartels of vegetable vendors are fixing price of vegetables on the basis of the wholesale price. So, the retail prices remain unusually high compared to the wholesale price. For instance, the wholesale price of brinjal is Rs 25 at Koley market (Sealdah wholesale market). But the same brinjal is selling at Rs 40-Rs 45 in most of the city markets.
 
 A source said the state has to intervene to plug the gap in wholesale and retail prices.
