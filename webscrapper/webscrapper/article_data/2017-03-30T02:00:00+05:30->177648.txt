PATNA: State   (RDD) minister   said on Wednesday the Centre has released only Rs1,784.82 crore in place of the notified first instalment sum of Rs2,387.39 crore for construction of houses under   (IAY) in current fiscal.

 Kumar was giving the governmentâ€™s reply to the short-notice question of senior   member Nand Kishore Yadav in the state assembly. In two chunks, the Centre fixed the target at 6.36 lakh IAY houses for the current fiscal after the launch of the scheme by the PM from Agra in November last year.
 
 Shrawan said the delay in the implementation of the IAY houses was also due to wrong data of socioeconomic caste census issued by the Centre in December last year for the identification of the beneficiaries. The data pertaining to 350 panchayats had not yet been sorted out, the minister added.
