CHENNAI: A day after the residents of   near Aminjikarai stopped at least 15 trucks and an earthmover for mining sand on the  , the police found that the contractor had been fraudulently transporting the sand with the claim that it was for DefExpo-2018, which starts near Chennai on April 11.

 The trucks drivers, who pasted ‘Defence Expo’ labels on their vehicles, the police said, “obtained permission from   officials to remove debris” from the banks of Cooum.
 
 “They had permission to remove only construction   but were involved in sand mining,” said an officer at Aminjikarai police station. “The residents are not ready to let the trucks go but are yet to lodge a police complaint.”
 
 The drivers pasted the ‘Defence Expo’ label to avoid being questioned, he said.
 
 The residents alleged that the drivers of the trucks had been smuggling sand for at least four days, operating only in the early morning hours after 3am, and claiming they were working for the defence expo. The drivers told them they were taking soil from the banks to conduct tests to erect pillars.
 
 Residents grew suspicious after finding that the river’s banks had in places been dug up to 100ft or more.
 
 PWD officials passed the buck to the police, claiming that they had to check whether the truck drivers were involved in sand mining.
 
 Residents on Friday blocked the road that the drivers were taking to the river bank by using their vehicles to stop the trucks. They later alerted the police.
