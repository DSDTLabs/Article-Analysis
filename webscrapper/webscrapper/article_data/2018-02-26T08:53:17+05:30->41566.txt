LUCKNOW:   survivors can experience parenthood if they choose the method of fertility preservation. 

 About 70% cancer patients might become victims of infertility due to heavy cancer treatment in the absence of counselling about fertility preservation by doctors. 
 
  To address the issue, the Indian Fertility Society, with its 1,900 members across 19 states, has formed a special interest group to spread awareness about fertility preservation. This is done through seminars titled 'fertility preservation navigators'. 
 
  In the city on Sunday, specialists Dr Pankaj Talwar and Dr   said that by freezing the egg, ovary, sperm and even embryo of a cancer patient, reproductive health can be restored and pregnancy possible, after the   is free of cancer. 
 
 "For girls under 15 years of age, there is ovary freezing. Girls above 15 years of age without a partner can get their eggs frozen after cancer detection. If there is a partner, then embryo freezing is done in which the embryo is put back into the mother after she is cancer-free," said Dr Talwar. 
 
 "The process will cost at least Rs 3 lakh for a procedure excluding the recurrent charge of maintenance of the frozen tissue," added Dr Khanna.
 
 Other experts at the event included Dr Gauri Devi, Dr K D Nayar, Dr Kunjumoideen, Dr PM   and Dr  . Gynaecologists and IVF practitioners from across the country attended the event.
