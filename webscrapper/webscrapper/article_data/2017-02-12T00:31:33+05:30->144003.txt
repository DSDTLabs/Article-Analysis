Chandigarh: The first round of talks between Jat leaders and Haryana government’s committee ended on an inconclusive note on Saturday in Panipat as the community announced to continue with its dharna till its demands were met. Haryana chief secretary DS Dhesi headed the panel during the talks. The meeting was held under heavy security.

 All India Jat Aarkashan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) president Yashpal Malik maintained that the talks were held in a peaceful atmosphere and the officers had sought three days’ time to consult the government on certain points.
 
 According to information, the talks remained inconclusive over the issue of withdrawal of criminal cases registered last year for violence during the Jat agitation and action against non-Jat leaders, including Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini.
 
 Sources said the talks, held at the seminar complex of Panipat refinery complex, lasted for three-and-a-half hours. “We will continue with our peaceful agitation. Since the officers have sought time on certain issues, we are hopeful of reaching some decision in the next round of meeting scheduled to be held soon,” said Malik.
 
 Meanwhile, in a related development, Karan Singh of Panju Khurd village, who was part of the dharna at Ikkis Gaun spot in Jind, died following a heart attack at the protest venue. Soon after the news went viral, many people reached the venue in Jind district. 
 
 In Kurukshetra, a delegation of Jat Sikhs extended their support to Jat leaders sitting on dharna. Other communities like Brahmins, Harijans, Valmikis, Kumhars and Nais have also offered support to the Jat stir.
