NEW DELHI: Unless a marked difference is noticed in the Class XII   exam   compared to previous years’, there will be no   of   this  . The main reason for introducing a single set of question papers for the exams, which was criticised after question papers were leaked, was to reduce the need for moderation of marks post evaluation.

 While a majority of the education boards, including the  , has in principle agreed against “bunching” and “spiking” of marks for the 2018 Board exams, the CBSE also expects that the moderation, if any, will be minimal.
 
 “As part of examination reforms, the Board last year decided to do away with the moderation policy,” a CBSE source said. “It was decided a single set question paper ensures a standardised difficulty level.”
 
 Majority of the state education boards with single set question papers won’t need to moderate marks as well. However, in case of a major difference in performances from that of the previous years, the boards have to look at moderation of marks.
 
 “Post evaluation, we will compare the results to last year’s,” said a CBSE official. “In case a major ambiguity is spotted, the committee will have to work out a policy. So even though we can’t say there will be no moderation at all, the level will be much lower, if needed.”
 
 The ministry of human resource development in October 2017 asked all the state boards to avoid the practice of artificial inflation of marks. In response, 23 states and Union Territories assured the board that they will not inflate marks. The states are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Delhi, Daman and Diu, and Puducherry.
 
 The practice of grace marks shall continue as that applies to enable a candidate to get the minimum pass marks required to qualify the exams.
