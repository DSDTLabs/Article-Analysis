GURUGRAM: Two city   brought laurels to the country in the recently concluded   held in Dhaka, Bangladesh. While 16-year-old   Parashar won gold in the compound men’s singles round, Rishabh Yadav (15) came back with a silver medal in the compound men’s team event.

 The 3rd South Asian Archery Championship, which took place during March 24-26, saw the participation of around 126 players from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
 
 Both city boys were selected for the event on the basis of their performances during the Khelo India Games. Kapil Kaushik, coach of the Indian archery team, said: “Harsh has a good hand and eye coordination, which eventually got him the gold medal in Dhaka. Similarly, Rishabh has always been a steady player.”
 
 Speaking about the win in Bangladesh, Sector 46 resident Harsh said, “The medal has come at the right time. Although I have competed at the national level on many occasions, this was my first international outing.” Rishabh, who lives in Sector 43, added: “The way players comport themselves during the tournament, be it winning or losing, is something we need to learn. I am happy that I won bronze. My aim now is to win a medal in the Commonwealth Games.”
 
 While both boys love the sport, they admitted that the expenses of the archery equipment take a toll on them. “I recently bought a new kit for Rs 2.5 lakh. All the equipment is US-made,” said Rishabh. Harsh agreed, “Bows often get broken during practice. A set of five bows costs around Rs 1.2 lakh.”
 
 Both boys study at Amity International School, Gurugram, and train at the school grounds. They are now gearing up for their exams. “My exams are going on, and it is difficult to manage both exams and archery practice. I took my books along to Dhaka and studied in my spare time,” said Rishabh, who is appearing for his Class X exams. Harsh, too, is preparing for his Class XI exams.
