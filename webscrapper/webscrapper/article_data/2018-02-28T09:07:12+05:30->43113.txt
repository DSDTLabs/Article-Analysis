  : Senior Congress leader   called off his nine-day hunger strike in front of the district collectorate, demanding   inquiry into the murder of   leader   S P, on Tuesday. 

 He ended his fast by drinking lime juice given by former chief minister Oommen Chandy. Former Union minister Vayalar Ravi, IUML leader C T Ahamadali, KPCC former president Thennala Balakrishna Pillai, Shuhaib's father C P Muhammed and three sisters were present.
 
 Sudhakaran decided to call off his agitation following the intervention of the party leadership, following the UDF decision to strengthen the campaign after the government ruled out CBI inquiry into the murder.
 
 The Congress leader, whose health deteriorated due to the hunger strike, was immediately rushed to a private hospital in Kannur. Earlier, he had said that he did not expect any justice from the government while starting the agitation, but he wanted to expose state of mind of those who rule the state.
 
 The UDF would take up the issue of the murder of Shuhaib legally and politically, said Chandy. The UDF has already moved the high court seeking CBI investigation. Chandy added that the government did not want CBI probe because it would ultimately lead to it leaders.
 
 "The government has backtracked from its earlier announcement that it was willing for CBI probe in the case. However, the UDF will fight till the family of Shuhaib gets justice," he added.
 
 It was in the early hours of February 13 that Shuhaib succumbed to injuries on the way to the hospital, after he was brutally hacked at Mattannur.
