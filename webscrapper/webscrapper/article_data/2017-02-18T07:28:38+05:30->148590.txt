SURAT: Parents of the   have opposed the Gujarat government’s decision to allow pro-rata based admissions to the   for the academic year 2017-18 under  .

 Terming government’s decision as unilateral and unfair, the parents of other board students organised a protest rally and submitted a memorandum to the district collector demanding justice. 
 
 Parents stated that the   has ruled last year to implement NEET as a single platform of admission, but the introduction of pro-rata will completely destroy the purpose. Gujarat is the only state in the country where pro-rata has been announced when the board exams are fast approaching.
 
 Giving a elaborate idea about the pro-rata system, parents said that if a hypothetical situation is to be believed then are 1,080 seats in government medical colleges. Remove 15% for all India quota, the remaining seats would be 918. Through the pro-rata system 872 seats will be filled by Gujarat board students and 46 seats will be remained for   and other board students of Gujarat.
 
 “This is most unfair. All students studying in Gujarat state irrespective of board belong to Gujarat. Because of the pro-rata, the students of other boards in Gujarat state have lesser seats in the state and are only eligible for 15% seats at all India level. Effectively they belong neither to Gujarat nor to India, and are being treated as second rate citizens,” said a parent.
