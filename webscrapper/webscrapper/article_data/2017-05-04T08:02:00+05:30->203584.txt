Ferozepur: Police have nabbed Lakha Dhillon, the key accused in Tuesday morning’s shooting that left SAD’s Ferozepur (rural) vice president, Balwinder Singh, injured and his father and elder brother dead.

 Ferozepur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Gaurav Garg said they arrested Lakha on Wednesday and were close to arresting the remaining 10 accused. The arrest came at a time when SAD workers had blocked the main road intersection of Ferozepur to demand police action in the case. As soon as they got information about the arrest, the SAD workers lifted their dharna, which had brought traffic on state and national highways passing through Ferozepur to a halt for eight hours.
 
 Balwinder’s father, Harnam Singh (80), and elder brother Joginder Singh (45) were shot dead as soon as they exited their house on Tuesday morning. Though the attackers shot at Balwinder too, he escaped with an injury to his foot. He is now the key witness.
 
 On a statement by Balwinder, police have booked 11 persons, including arrested Lakha Dhillon, Karaj Singh, Ranjit Singh, Sukjinder Singh, Gurvinder Singh, Pargat Singh, Chanan Singh, Jaspal Singh, Bachittar Singh, Gurmit Singh and Jaspal Singh. SAD leaders alleged that Lakha wanted to take control of the village’s panchayat after the formation of the Congress government in the state, and had been pressuring and threatening Balwinder’s family with dire consequences.
 
 On Wednesday, the protesters disrupted traffic headed for Amritsar, Chandigarh, Faridkot, Muktsar and Fazilka. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal was scheduled to join the protest, but could not make it. In his absence, party leaders Joginder Singh Jindu, Vardev Singh alias Nonni Mann and Avtar Singh Zira led the agitation.
