Vadodara: Shivam Solanki, who had lost both his arms and a leg after an electric shock struck him down three years ago, cleared his SSC exams with flying colours on Monday. 

 Shivam had appeared for the exam without taking help of any scribe. Instead, he inserted pen inside socks that covered his amputated arm to write down the answer sheets for which he was practising since last three years.
 
 “It was my mother who gave this idea to me. I was eleven years old when I lost my legs and arms due to an electric shock from a high-tension line while I was trying to catch hold of a kite,” Shivam, now 16, told TOI after clearing his exams with 89% and 98.53 percentile marks. 
 
 Son of Mukesh Solanki and Hansaben Solanki – both of whom work as ‘safai kamdars’ with the VMC, Shivam, a student of Jeevan Sadhana School, is aiming to become a doctor. 
 
 “I will take science stream and join medicine after class XII,” said Shivam, a resident of Baranpura area of Vadodara. “After he met the accident, I asked him to start practising by inserting ball pen inside the socks covering his amputated arms,” said an elated Hansaben, adding that Shivam has never taken help of any assistant scribe while appearing for his exams .
