LUCKNOW: The All India Ulema and Mashaikh Board, a body representing Indian Sunni Muslims, scholars and clerics has decided to hold public meetings in all districts of Uttar Pradesh to align minorities in favour of Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party ahead of UP assembly elections. AIUMB president Syed Mohammad Ashraf Kichhouchhwi told TOI, “In the first such meeting in Sambhal road area of Moradabad on Sunday, we will seek people’s support for  .”

 AIUMB happens to be a representative body comprising ‘Sajjada Nasheen‘ (patrons-in-chief) of dargahs, imams of masjids, mufti and teachers of madrassas. According to their website, the board advocates rejection of radical Islam.
 
 Support to BSP comes at a time when   is stepping up her Muslim outreach in   and spreading it across the state ahead of the crucial assembly polls. Kichhouchhwi said the board was disappointed in the ruling Samajwadi Party for not fulfilling promises it made to the community in 2012. “I was one of the few Muslim clerics who got points like reservations for Muslim, Dargah act and inclusion of Urdu in PCS (J) examination, incorporated in SP’s manifesto in 2012 assembly elections. We pursued the state government but to no avail and now, the party has removed the points from its current manifesto,” he said, adding that the community had been at the receiving end because of poor law and order in the state. The cleric said in Mayawati’s regime law and order situation was robust.
 
 The board does not have much influence in communally sensitive West UP where Mayawati eyes a strong Dalit-Muslim combine to help her come back to power. Member of Central Haj Committee, Arshad Mian, however, said the board may not have presence in Saharanpur where Islamic Seminary Darul Uloom Deoband is situated, or in Meerut, Baghpat and Bulandshahr but it set up has offices in almost all districts from Agra and to Gorakhpur in the east. Deoband has closed its doors to politicians during assembly elections.
