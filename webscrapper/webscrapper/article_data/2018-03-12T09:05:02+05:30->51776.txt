BENGALURU: Every time during an election, veteran leaders talk about retiring from active politics. ‘This will be my last poll,’ is a line often bandied about. In reality, though, politicians rarely call it a day.

 From JD(S) patriarch   to chief minister Siddaramaiah to revenue minister  , several politicians have played the ‘retirement card’. But none walk the talk.   has, in fact, created a record of sorts — he has been talking of retirement for the past 10 years.
 
 During the last assembly elections, several politicians claimed they would retire, but now they’re gearing up to join the fray. In 2013, for instance, Siddaramaiah had categorically said it would be his last election, that he would retire and pave the way for youngsters. But with the party’s surprise victory in Nanjangud and Gundlupet bypolls, he put his retirement plans on hold. “To stop communal forces from coming to power, I have decided to continue in politics,” Siddaramaiah had said.
 
 Senior   leader from Yadgir, A B Malakareddi, had announced he would not contest in 2018. But as “an obedient people’s representative’’, he said he’s yielded to pressure from the people. “Yes, I had announced I would retire, but people of my constituency want me to contest. I am under pressure. So I have decided to contest,” Malakareddi explained.
 
 Thimmappa, 86, is also reconsidering exit plans. “I will contest if the party gives me a ticket,” he said. There are reports that the party could field actor Jayamala from Sagar, the minister's constituency.
 
 A senior BJP MLA said: “In India, we hardly find any politician retiring unless he is repeatedly defeated. The talk of retirement is always intended to evoke sympathy, nothing else.”
