MALAPPURAM: Failure on the part of Malayali Maoist couple   and Shyna to maintain the secrecy of the party activities and their individualism and disregard for security norms of the party was the reason for the debacle of the Maoist movements in Western Ghats zone, said a digital document of the central committee of CPI (Maoist) recovered by police.

 The couple, Roopesh and Shyna, wanted in connection with at least 30 cases in Kerala , were arrested along with three other suspected Maoists from Karumathampetty near Coimbatore by a joint team of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu police on May 4, 2015. Roopesh, in-charge of   of CPI (Maoist) had been leading the movement in the tri-juction of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, along with his wife.
 
 The document of central committee of the party, which was recovered from the laptop of the slain Maoist leader Kuppu Devaraj, who was also a central committee member of the party, says “most of the comrades in the region had been very loose in following the methods of secret practice”. The report mentioned Roopesh and Shyna, who were known as Kariyan (K) and Priya (P) respectively among Maoists. The report said that K and P had shown thorough disregard for the security norms related to establishing camps and shelters inside forest and they had kept their two children in the camp though they were fully aware that the children were being monitored by the security agencies.
 
 The document strongly criticized the couple pointing out that they put the “comrades and party at risk” by keeping the letters of communication between the couple and cadres for the past ten years. 
 
 The letters and many other documents seized from Roopesh and Shyna led the security officials to may crucial findings regarding Maoist movements in Western Ghats region.
