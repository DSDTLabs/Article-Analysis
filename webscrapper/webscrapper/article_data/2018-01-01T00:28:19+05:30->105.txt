Coimbatore: Do you find yourself reluctant to throw away unused prescription medicines that are still effective? Help is at hand. A city-based non-profit organisation plans to place boxes across various outlets here, asking people to deposit unused unexpired medicines that will later be distributed at old age homes. The Inner Wheel Club of Coimbatore has already placed one box at Pazhamudhir Nilayam on Trichy Road. The organisation launched the venture after it found it difficult to get medicines for the inmates of old age homes, its president Shanthi Rajashekar told TOI. “People often donate food and clothes. Most of us have a lot of medicines at home that remain unused, and after several months and years, have to be thrown away. We wanted to collect those medicines and donate them to the old age homes,” she said. Nirmala Kasturi Rangaiyan, a member of the organisation, said that not only was there a huge scarcity of medicines at orphanages and old age homes, but medicines were becoming expensive as well. “The shops that give good discounts do not have several medicines that the elderly are in need of. We hope that this will help fill that gap,” she said. “Many of us buy multi-vitamin tablets, calcium tablets and also tablets for fever and other disorders. Most of the times, the course is not completed. And sometimes, we buy in excess. Such tablets can be donated,” Nirmala said. The charity organisation will soon place more boxes to collect the medicines. “Based on the response from the people, we will place these boxes at various outlets,” said Shanthi. They organisation plans to distribute the collected medicines at St. Joseph Old Age Home in Podanur, Families for Children and Eera Nenjam in R S Puram.
