Rajkot: A 33-year-old man with learning difficulties attempted self-immolation at a GSRTC pickup centre near Malaviya Nagar police station on Mavdi Road on Wednesday. He was taken to the civil Hospital where he is said to be in critical condition.

 Police found an Aadhaar card from his pocket which mentioned his name as Abhishek Bhulanbhai Rai. He is a native of Uttar Pradesh. Police sub-inspector G A Khachar said, “He brought petrol from somewhere and set himself ablaze on a bench at the GSRTC pickup centre. He has suffered 70% burns.” 
 
 Local people said that he had been staying at the GSRTC pickup point and used to beg for food from people. Two weeks ago, the roof of the GSRTC pickup point caught fire when he set ablaze the garbage that he had collected there.
