CHENNAI: Actor and Congress national   quit Twitter on Tuesday, saying the platform was addictive. The actor, who had close to a million followers when she tweeted her decision to go off the social networking site “4 sumtime”, had a few words of advice for her followers — use the platform to build “this nation n not 2 divide”.

 On Monday,   seemingly took a dig at actor Shruti Haasan for opting out of her home production, Sangamithra. Haasan said she had not received proper dates and a bound script. Khushbu tweeted that such a movie “cannot be made without proper planning” and that she expected “a little more of professionalism frm ppl who carry a legacy”.
 
 On Tuesday, however, the actor told her followers she decided to “go off Twitter 4 sumtime”. She thanked her followers and advised them to “keep hate n vengeance out..spread love, joy n peace”.
 
 Two months ago, Khushbu was involved in a war of words on the site with BJP TN unit president   over actor Rajinikanth’s entry into politics. Khushbu has also hit out against trolls.
 
 The actor-politician told TOI, “I left Twitter because I found I was getting addicted to it. I'd wake up in the morning and check my phone”.
 
 Asked if her decision had anything to do with Twitter trolls, or her recent cyber-spats, she said, “No. I’m the last person to let any of those things affect me.”
 
 “I’m a voracious reader, because of Twitter I stopped reading. In between my shots, I’m on the phone. I realised I can do something else,” she said. She is not on Facebook either but has an Instagram account. 
 
 Khushbu added, “I can always find ways to communicate with people. Political parties have grown from strength to strength even without  .
