MANALI: Over a hundred villages in 28   have been covered in deep snow and witnessing several avalanches in the last two days. All   are blocked and people have to walk on over 100 cm thick layer of snow.The valley has no  ,   or water and thus cut off from rest of the world.

 The valley has received 120 cm to 170 cm of snow since January 25, confining people indoors. An avalanche on Friday damaged a footbridge over Bhaga river connecting Chheling village. Another avalanche near Sissu village had damaged power transmission lines. Lahaul-Spiti district administration asked the residents to stay away from avalanche prone areas and avoid unnecessary movement towards isolated areas. As the avalanche threat is looming over a hundred prone sites in the valley, the administration has cancelled the pulse polio programme of January 29 for administering oral polio vaccine to children.
 
  
  
 
 In the past, avalanches have blocked the flow of Chenab river many times and damaged property worth crores of rupees.The region already had a layer of snow which turned into ice due to extreme cold. Another thick layer of snow on existing layer increased the possibility of avalanches in the next few days.
 
 To avoid collapsing of roofs, people are continuously removing snow from their houses, even during heavy snowfall. On Saturday morning, when sky was little clear, people removed snow from above the vehicles which had disappeared under snow.
 
 Residents are melting snow to get water for drinking and cooking purposes.
 
 Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner Vivek Bhatia said the footbridge close to Keylong damaged due to an avalanche has been declared unsafe. He added, “The new date for polio vaccination will be declared soon. Also, police, disaster management and all departments are on alert.“
