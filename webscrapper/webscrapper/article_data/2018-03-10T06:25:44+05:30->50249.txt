AMRITSAR: Pyarelal Wadali, of the famous Punjabi Sufi duo  , died in a private hospital here on Friday after prolonged illness. He was 75. 

 Pyarelal, who was suffering from diabetes along with renal and cardiac problems, had been admitted to Fortis Hospital on February 26, the hospital's director of cardiology, Dr Arun Chopra told TOI. Pyarelal's diabetes had led to gangrene in one of his feet, the cardiologist said, adding that the singer passed away at 8.25 am on Friday. The cause of death was renal failure and septicemia.
 
 His singing partner, music guru and elder brother   was in deep shock after hearing the news. Unable to bear the grief of his brother's death, Puranchand closeted himself in a room on Friday.
 
 Pyarelal's nephew Lakhwinder Wadali, who is also a Sufi singer, broke the news of his uncle's demise on his Facebook page, writing: "Chacha Pyarelal Ji No More. May his soul always rest in peace. Daata hi daata."
 
 The cremation was held on Friday evening at Guru Ki Wadali, the native village of the Wadali Brothers in the Amritsar district, and was attended by hundreds of his fans. Pyarelal is survived by wife  , sons Satpal Kumar and   and daughters Sheela Rani, Seema Rani and Raj Rani.
