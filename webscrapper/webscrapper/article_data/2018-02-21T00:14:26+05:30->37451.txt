Pune: The general body of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Tuesday gave its green signal to a new garbage   plant at  , but the project might run into a controversy because of the local leaders’ opposition and threat to start an agitation.

 The details of the project were tabled before the general body. A group of elected members opposed the plan but it was approved because the ruling BJP, having a clear majority in PMC, was in favour of it.
 
 The corporators of the Opposition stressed the civic administration should implement the project in some other area of the city, where land had been reserved for such a facility. “The project is nothing but injustice to the residents of Hadapsar. The area is already bearing the load of the city’s garbage. One more   will add to its burden,” said Chetan Tupe, the leader of Opposition in PMC.
 
 The plant having a capacity to process 500 metric tonnes of   will be built at Ramtekdi. The project will cost around Rs325 crore. Its price has gone up by around Rs108 crore because of the delay in approval.
 
 “The garbage plant was approved a couple of years ago and was supposed to be built at Uruli-Phursungi. But it has been shifted from there to Hadapsar. So, the approval had to be taken again,” Suresh Jagtap, the head of PMC’s solid waste management department, told reporters.
 
 The civic administration had drafted an “action plan to mitigate the garbage problem” in the meetings held with various stakeholders. The administration has planned to increase the decentralized garbage processing facilities.
 
 Pune generates nearly 1,600 metric tonnes of garbage every day. Civic officials stressed around 15% of the total garbage generated in the city was plastic trash. The quantity is growing day by the day as the population is increasing.
