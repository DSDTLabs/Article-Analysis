KOLKATA: Dressed in a red Tshirt, a pair of track pants and a pair of green and white sneakers, actor Vikram Chatterjee walked out of Presidency jail holding his father's hand on Thursday evening, 17 days since he was sent to judicial custody by an Alipore court on July 10.

 The 30-year-old ducked a low ceiling leading to the iron gate and came out of the jail. His aunt, who was the first to hug him, dragged him towards a black   Elantra that was waiting outside the jail with the ignition turned on. Vikram's mother Mallika was inside the car and as Vikram sat beside her in the backseat, she held her tightly and broke down. The car sped towards   followed by four other cars carrying Vik ram's cousins and friends, who had come to the jail to take him back home.
 
 Accused of culpable homicide not amounting to murder for the death of his friend and co-passenger   in the wee hours of April 29, the ac tor was arrested only on July 7. He spent three nights in police-lock up, before an Alipore court sent him to jail.
 
 On Wednesday, an Alipore sessions court granted Vikram bail on the conditions of providing two sureties of Rs 25,000 each and submission of his passport. However, the order reached the jail only on Thursday evening.
 
 Vikram's father  , along with the lawyers, personally accompanied the officers as they got the orders signed and documents verified by the magistrate and brought them to the jail at 5pm. . Vikram's belongings, a mud-smeared black rucksack and a polythene packet, were handed over to his father around 5.30pm and Vikram was released an hour later just after dusk had set in.
