Ghaziabad: The uploading of the objectionable video on the official Facebook page of GMC has brought to focus the manner in which many government departments handle their social media sites. In the recent past, organisations like GDA, GMC and the office of district magistrate have started Facebook pages and Twitter handles to increase their reach among the people.

 The GDA has its own Facebook page and Twitter handle and officials claim that that the chances of them getting misused are remote. “There is an IT department which takes care of the GDA’s Twitter handle and FB page and the contents shared have to pass through at least three stages before it is finally uploaded,” said Atul Sharma, executive officer, GDA. “The content shared is first of all vetted by secretary or other department heads which is screened by the IT department for any typographical or factual error before it is uploaded,” said Sharma.
 
 The GDA had hired the services of an IT expert provided by a firm. “The guy who handles GDA’s social media has been hired on contract and the password is known only to a few in the IT department and the guy who handles it,” said Sharma. “The chances of it getting misused is remote as the IT department strictly monitors it on a daily basis,” said Sharma.
 
 The DM’s office has devised a more robust method to ensure that its Twitter handle is not misused. “There are only three persons who have access to Twitter handle password which includes DM, SDM sadar and one e-district manager,” said Prem Ranjan Singh, SDM (Sadar). It has no FB page. 
 
 The GMC, on the other hand, is the most vulnerable. “Since GMC has many departments, each head assigns someone on an ad hoc basis to post contents on FB or Twitter page,” said an employee. “Needless to say that the password is being shared by many which has resulted in this faux pass,” he said.
