Even as   was enjoying a Holi party, he had friends coming up to him and ribbing him about a prank he pulled some time back. When the actor put up a picture of himself as a dulha with a dulhan next to him, in a mandap decked with all kinds of wedding finery, little did he know that it would go viral. “I was flooded with congratulatory messages and well-wishers are still commenting on that post, even though I clarified the very next day that it was a   shot for an episode of  ,” says the actor. “This was just for fun. I was bored waiting for my shot, and thought of pulling a prank. My co-actor   was in on it and she had no problem with the photo being posted,” he adds.
In reality,   is enjoying his single status. “I have had my share of relationships but for the past 10 years, I have not met anybody with whom I would want to spend my life. I am used to living by myself now,” smiles Khera. He is absolutely clear about one thing — that he does not want to marry just for the sake of it. “My heart and soul should speak the same language. There has to be a connect when and if I meet somebody! But I must say, living alone is addictive; you get so used to your space and independence. My family has given up on me now. Single or married, they just want my happiness,” Rajesh signs off.
