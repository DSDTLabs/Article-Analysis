LUCKNOW: The IAS officer, who had booked   in a 2007 riot case, will launch his music video, 'Ro chuke jinke liye rona tha', on Saturday. 

 Hari Om, a 1997-batch IAS officer, was   DM in 2007, when   - then MP - was arrested for allegedly fanning communal unrest and defying prohibitory orders.
 
  He is at present serving at an insignificant post of secretary, general administration.
 
 The music video is part of album called Rang Ka Dariya that will be released in Lucknow on Saturday. Talking to TOI on the eve of the launch,   said that he always loved gushing out his creative abilities and is only 'fulfiling them' through this album, similar to what he has done in the past. He, however, sidestepped queries on being sidelined despite being a topper in Hindi medium in his batch.
 
 "I do my riyaz early morning for at least an hour with a harmonium before reading morning newspapers and heading off to office. Having born and raised in  , I have always loved the Hindi language and honed my skills. I have had wide literature taste, ranging from Faiz Ahmed Faiz to modern-day Hindi writers. I am content that I can put it to constructive use which people of this country can relate to. My audience even includes my two little daughters," he said.
 
 Holding a post-doctorate degree in Hindi literature from JNU, he has penned four books, two of which are a compilation of ghazals and the remaining two short stories. Hari Om was the secretary of culture department during the previous SP regime, but was transferred to general administration a month after Yogi took over as the CM.
 
 His new album has five ghazals, of which four have been penned by him. The lyrics for the music video, however, has been written by retired UP-cadre IAS officer Anis Ansari.
