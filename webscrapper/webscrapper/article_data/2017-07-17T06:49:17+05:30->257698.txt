PUNE: The rural police arrested nine persons and seized four tonnes meat, suspected to be cow  , on the Pune ­Ahmednagar highway near Ranjangaon, 55 km from here, in the early hours of Sunday.

 While the animal husbandry officer RD   confirmed the seized meat was beef, samples were later sent for a forensic lab test to ascertain whether it was cow, bullock or buffalo meat. The law prohibits possession or transportation of cow and bullock meat but there is no such restriction on buffalo meat.
 
 Ranjangaon police's investigating officer Nanasaheb Kale said the suspects did not have a licence or permit from any veterinary authority for the transportation of meat leading to their arrests.
 
 The meat consignment was headed from Beed to Mumbai. The Ranjangaon MIDC police said they got a call from the members of the Akhil Bharatiya Krishi Gau Seva Sangh that they had intercepted two vehicles ­ mini truck and a pick-up van ­ which were illegally transporting cow beef.
 
 The complainant, Swami, said that he got information early on Sunday that beef would be transported in two vehicles on the Pune-Ahmednagar highway . The informant gave Swami the registration numbers of the two vehicles. Swami and other members of his group intercepted the vehicles near the bus stand at Ranjangaon around 3.30am.
 
 Following this, the police reached the spot and seized the meat. The drivers told the police that the mini-truck had meat of about 35 animals.
 
 Those arrested were later produced in a local court which released them on bail.
