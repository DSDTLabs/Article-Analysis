Panaji: It may be the 18th consecutive year since  , an annual folk festival, is being organized in Goa, but the average Goan artisan was hardly aware all this while that this was a platform for them to showcase their handicrafts. Mapusa-based potter Vincent Fernandes made his debut at the Lokotsov this year and is pleasantly surprised by the opportunities and exposure that this market has for traders like him.

 “The 10-day festival received a massive participation from traders from other states. But homegrown artisans like me are yet to penetrate this market and make use of this platform,” he said.
 
 It was only when his wife, Severin learnt of the Panaji-based festival, that he applied to the department of art and culture to participate.
 
 “There is a mix of Goans as well as tourists who come to my stall. While the locals are aware of the benefits of cooking in earthen vessels, the tourists need to be told that certain wares are for curries while others are for storing water or mere display,”
 
 The stall has dhuparne, budkule, curry pots, colher, figurines etc. Having carried with him a stock worth Rs 15,000-20,000 with items ranging from Rs 150 to 500, Fernandes is currently making a profit of approximately Rs 10-20 on each item.
 
 Looking at the exposure that the festival has for people involved in traditional trade, he said, “The festival seems very handicraft-based. There are others selling ceramics and earthen-ware but they are all from neighbouring states. There should be more Goa-based traditional products in this festival because people want these items.”
