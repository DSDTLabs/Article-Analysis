JAMSHEDPUR: The   (MDWP) is expected to be operational by October following which 2,000 houses located in the fringe of the eastern part of the   will get piped drinking water connection. After completion of the project, close to 1.5 lakh people living in 12 slums across Bagunnagar, Bagunhatu, Birsanagar, Moharda, Hurlung and   will benefit from this project. 

 Jusco, a private utility enterprise, is implementing the Rs 27 crore project. Special officer of Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee ( ) Sanjay Kumar inspected the project and said, "Work related to improvisation of storage reservoir, quality testing laboratory, sand filtration and purification of water is progressing smoothly and the project will be completed by October."
 
 In June 2017, Jusco had inked a memorandum of understanding with the JNAC and state drinking water and sanitation department for transfer, operation and maintenance of the MDWP. 
 
 The foundation stone of the MDWP was laid by then chief minister   in September 2006 and was expected to be complete in a two-year time frame.
 
  However, delay in sanction of funds, wrong selection of the implementing agencies and technical glitches made things difficult for the project which got delayed by a decade.
 
 However, after chief minister   took over in 2014, he made efforts to streamline the Moharda project and as part of the scheme of things, Jusco was put in-charge of implementation of the multi-crore project.
 
 "To avail a quality civic life that includes a better road, tap water connection and uninterrupted electricity the consumers should be prepared to also pay for it and not avail everything for free," said a JNAC official.
