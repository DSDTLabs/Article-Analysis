PANAJI: After probing into the   for almost four years, and the accused being untraceable, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has approached the   first class (JFMC), Vasco, seeking permission to close the case.

 The case will come up for hearing on Thursday. 
 
 On January 14, 2013, a seven-year-old girl was raped in the toilet of the school where she was studying. 
 
 During the course of investigation, the CBI said it interrogated 391 suspects. 
 
 Despite having the biological evidence, the CBI was unable to trace the accused. It carried out DNA test on 14 suspects, including on the headmistressâ€™ nephew and son, put eight suspects through the lie detection test, and did fingerprint matching of nine suspects, but did not get favourable results. 
 
 The Goa police and the CBI also released three different sketches of the accused.
 
 A case was registered at the Mormugao police station under Sections 447, 376 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 8(2) of the Goa Children Act, 2003, and Section 3 (a) punishable under Section 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. It was transferred to the crime branch of Goa police on the same day.
 
 Almost four months later, in May, an NGO demanded that the case be handed over to the CBI, as the local crime branch had failed to make any detection.
 
 Agreeing to the demand, the state government accorded consent to the Delhi special police establishment and after the Union home ministry issued a notification transferring the case, CBI took over the case from the crime branch of Goa police in September 2013.
 
 In a second case, the Goa police had arrested the headmistress of the school on charges of negligence. But when the CBI took over the   girl rape case, it declined from investigating the second case - that of negligence registered against the school headmistress and management.
 
 In its closure report the CBI has said that the culprit was not traceable despite all efforts.
