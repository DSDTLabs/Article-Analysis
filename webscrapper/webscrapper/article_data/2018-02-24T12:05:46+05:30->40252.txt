CHANDIGARH: A 32-year-old woman, who had hardly expected to become a mother due to her end stage liver disease requiring transplant, recently gave birth to a   girl in PGI. She had undergone liver transplantation at   and after three years of follow-up, delivered her first child on Wednesday. “It is a first case at our institute following liver transplant for a woman who could not have a baby due to advanced liver disease,” said Dr  , director, PGI.

 
 The liver recipient had developed autoimmune hepatitis and complications of cirrhosis of liver. She had undergone a deceased donor liver transplant in August 2015 in PGI. “She was not able to conceive because of advanced liver disease. Only solution was to replace her diseased liver with a new liver,” said  , head of the hepatology department in the institute.
 
 
 
 
 The woman had a C-section on February 21. After a careful monitoring by a team of doctors, including hepatologists, transplant surgeons and obstetricians, she gave birth to a healthy baby. The concern for the woman on delivering the baby was that as she was on immune suppressive drugs after the liver transplantation, it could affect the health of the newborn.
 
 
 But after discussing with Dr Dhiman she was convinced and went ahead.
