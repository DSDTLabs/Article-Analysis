PUNE: The intelligence and criminal investigation wing of the income tax department, Pune, has detected 30,000 transactions worth Rs 20,000 crore of unreported specialised financial transactions (SFTs) in the Pune region during the last financial year.

 
  
 
 SFTs are cash deposits or withdrawals of Rs 10 lakh or more in accounts other than the current and over Rs 50 lakh or more in any current account in a given financial year. The I-T Act mandates banks and sub-registrar offices to report such transactions, which did not happen in this case.
 
 To be sure, all these are not tax evaded monies. However, because they go unreported, their source cannot be established. “We will ascertain these accounts and if the depositor/s are able to explain the source, there is no issue. Otherwise, we will deal with them under relevant sections,” a senior tax official said.
 
 Even banks and sub-registrar offices are liable to be penalised under the act for not reporting, under-reporting or for giving incomplete details like PAN.
 
 The officer said occasionally banks themselves are not aware of the rules and do not keep track of the data. “Also, of the 30,000-odd unreported transactions in FY2018, 80% of them in value and volume were mostly from the different sub-registrars’ office,” he said.
 
 For now, the tax department is allowing banks and sub-registrar offices to file a revised SFT returns as the system is new. “Value wise, Pune directorate’s detection of Rs 20,000 crore of unreported transactions was the highest in the country for the FY 2017-18,” the officer said, adding that it has been said some bank officials and registrars collude with customers to purposefully to under-report transactions.
