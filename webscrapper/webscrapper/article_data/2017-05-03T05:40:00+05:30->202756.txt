LUCKNOW: The volume of   in UP by   could be a staggering Rs 700 crore. This is the assessment reportedly submitted by   at a meeting with chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar and other senior government officials on Tuesday.

 The prime accused in the scam, Ravinder, has confessed to have been in the business of installing these electronic chips at gas stations for the past seven years. The estimate was arrived at on the basis of   sales of the gas stations raided in Lucknow and the amount of petrol that was siphoned at the dispensing units. 
 
 “In all, there are 6423 petrol pumps in UP which have around 25000 dispensing units,” an oil company officer said. Representing Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), the officers said they were shocked by the revelation made by the STF. 
 
 The STF had last week busted a racket in which an electronic chip was introduced in the dispensing unit of gas stations to tamper the circuit in a manner that less petrol was dispensed from the nozzle as compared to the meter reading. The remote-controlled chip, installed at a cost of Rs 3000, could hold back anything up to 100 ML of petrol per litre from the dispensing unit merely by a push of a button.
 
 Apart from the chief secretary, principal secretary (home) Debashish Panda, Director General of Police (DGP) Sulkhan Singh, Inspector General (IG) Lucknow Zone A Satish Ganesh, IG (STF) Ram Kumar, SSP STF Amit Pathak and SP STF Arvind Chaturvedi, who has led the entire operation on ground, were also present at the meeting.
