Madurai: The death toll in Sundayâ€™s forest fire in Kurangani hill in Theni district, which turned tragic for a group of trekkers, increased to eleven on Tuesday with the family of Divya opting to take her off the life support system at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) here. Meanwhile, the condition of five other fire victims admitted to the hospital continues to be serious. 

 Divya, 25, of Erode who sustained 90 per cent injuries, was not responding to treatment and had been in a comatose state, according to hospital sources. Hence, her family requested the hospital to take her off the life support system. She had got married only three months ago and her husband, Vivek, 27, had also succumbed to his injuries at the Theni hospital on Monday. Among the five others undergoing treatment at GRH, Kannan, 26, of Erode is on ventilator support while the remaining four are women. Anu Vidhya has 90 per cent burn injuries while the other three have lesser degree of burns. All of them continued to be under intensive care, according to Dr D Maruthupandian.
 
 Governor Banwarilal Purohit, who arrived in Madurai to participate in the convocation of the Mother Teresa University in Kodaikanal, visited the injured being treated at GRH. He was accompanied by minister K P Anbazhagan, health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan, Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao and dean of the hospital, Dr D Maruthupandian. He enquired about the condition of the patients and also consoled their family members, many of whom broke down on seeing the governor. tnn
