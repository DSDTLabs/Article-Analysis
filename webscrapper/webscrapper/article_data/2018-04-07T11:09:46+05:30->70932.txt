VADODARA : Kevadiya colony where the ‘Statue of Unity’ is getting final touches will be connected to Vadodara through a broad gauge railway line by September next year. 

 Gujarat government is aiming to inaugurate the 182-metre tall statue by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 31 this year – the birth anniversary of India’s Iron Man - Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. 
 
 Railway Board’s chairman  , who is on a two-days visit to Gujarat on Friday, inspected the   narrow gauge railway line and the proposed line that will connect Chandod to Kevadiya colony.
 
 The project cost is around Rs 663 crore, according to railway officials. 
 
 “We are very positive and aggressive that we will be able to convert the present narrow gauge line between Dabhoi to Chandod into broad gauge line for which the work has already started. The target to finish the gauge conversion of the 17 km stretch is October this year,” said Amit Kumar Singh, divisional railway manager of Vadodara railway division who accompanied Lohani and   general manager A K Gupta during their visit to the sites. 
 
 While the gauge conversion project is estimated at Rs 180 crore, the new railway line connecting Chandod to Kevadiya colony is expected to cost Rs 483 crore to the Indian Railways. 
 
 “Presently, there is no railway line between Chandod and Kevadiya. Being a new alignment, land acquisition for the project is currently under progress with the help of revenue department of Gujarat government. Our target is to complete the project by September next year,” said Singh, adding that the new railway line will be nearly 32 km. 
 
 In the 2017 union budget the gauge conversion of Dabhoi-Chandod railway line and its extension up to Kevadiya colony in Narmada district – totalling 49 km - was announced by the finance minister.
