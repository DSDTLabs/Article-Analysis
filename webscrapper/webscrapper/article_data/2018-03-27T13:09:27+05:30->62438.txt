TRICHY: The city corporation has made it mandatory for bulk waste generating units (producing more than 50kg waste per day) to come up with their own waste processing and disposal system by setting up a   facility. Bulk waste generators contribute to 30 to 40% of the total waste generated in the city daily. 

 Such units identified by the civic body have been given April 30 as deadline to set up a waste management facility within their compounds, as from May 1 onwards sanitary workers will only collect non-biodegradable waste from such units.
 
 In a recent directive from the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA), as part of solid waste management rules 2016, urban local bodies (ULB) have been advised to direct bulk waste generators producing more than 50kg waste each day to process and dispose biodegradable waste on their own premises. 
 
 “If the identified bulk waste generators start processing and disposing their degradable waste independently each day, it will save a lot of manpower and corresponding man hours required for door-to-door waste collection,” said E Parasuraman, sanitary inspector with Ariyamangalam zone.
 
 The civic body implementing the Bulk Solid Waste Generators’ Rule 2016 has identified 180 units including hostels, education institutions, hotels and gated communities generating more than 50kg waste per day.
 
 Once the rules for bulk waste generators are implemented, non-cooperating waste generators will be penalised by the civic body with a fine ranging between Rs 200 to Rs 10,000. “Sensitisation is underway to identify bulk waste generators who were suggested with solutions to pursue such as mini-biogas plant and green bins that turn degradable waste to compost. Except financial assistance, all technical support will be provided by the civic body,” corporation commissioner   said.
