In the upcoming track of Trideviyaan, Dinanath Chauhan (Rituraj Singh) and the Trideviyaan have another case to solve. Dinanath wants to expose a corrupt CBI officer, who is coming to test DN catering’s food. He prepares a serum, which will have people start blurting out the truth and he wants the CBI officer to drink it. But his plan fails as Manu ( ) drinks it instead. 
Next, Manu reveals the real identity of her father and her sisters-in-law, who are secret agents. Due to the revelation, Dinanath, Tanu (Samaira Rao) and Dhanu’s ( ) plan fails. Now, they have two missions to achieve; to see that Manu doesn’t reveal more about them, and to get the CBI officer to reveal the truth. Shalini said, “This track will reveal the truth of Trideviyaan and Dinanath. It will be interesting to see how the Chauhans try to sail through the situation.”
 Trideviyaan airs from Monday-Friday at 9.30 pm on   SAB.
