UDUPI: The   call given by   Taluk Horata Samithi on Friday for non-inclusion of Hebri in the list of new taluks announced by CM Siddaramaiah during his budget speech on Wednesday received a mixed response.

 While some owners closed their shops voluntarily to express solidarity with the samithi, which is fighting for   to Hebri, it was business as usual for others.
 
 The members of the samithi held a protest at Hebri bus stand and condemned the state government’s decision to overlook their long pending demand. 
 
 Mutlapadi Sathish Shetty, member of the samithi said, “We have been fighting for taluk status to Hebri for the last six decades. All the government appointed committees have recommended for the same and politicians and the successive governments have been promising to make Hebri as taluk but till today the demand has not been met. The present Congress government has also failed us.”
 
 He also questioned the rationale behind creating Brahmavar and Kaup as new taluks which are within a distance of 12-14 km. On the other hand, people of Hebri have to travel 40 km to reach taluk headquarters in Karkala. “It seems Brahmavar and Kaup represented by Congress MLAs Vinaykumar Sorake and Pramod Madhwaraj respectively, were made taluk on political considerations,’’ he added.
 
 Bhaskar Jothsya, samithi president, warned that the people of Hebri will intensify their protest if the state government does not concede to the demand.
 
 Prasanna Shetty, a localite ,demanded that the state review its decision and announce Hebri as a taluk as people have been demanding for it for the last six decades “We will give six days for the government to announce Hebri as a taluk. Then we will intensify our protest,’’ he added.
