IMPHAL: The Centre pressed the Indian   Force's (IAF's) C-17 Globemaster, a cargo aircraft, into service to fly six fuel tankers to   on Sunday and Monday to ease the oil shortage in the state triggered by the ongoing economic blockade. The blockade, imposed by United Naga Council (UNC) to oppose the creation of new districts in Manipur, entered its 84th day on Monday .Defence spokesman   told TOI that the IAF airlifted diesel tankers with a total capacity of 96 kilolitres, or 96,000 litres, from Guwahati to Imphal on January 22 and 23. The first dispatch, loaded with 32 kilolitres of diesel in two tankers, landed at the Imphal international airport around 7 pm.

 The move comes in the wake of a series of meetings between Union home minister   and representatives from the state's civil society, as well as the chief ministers of Manipur and Nagaland, in New Delhi.
 
 Since November 1, UNC has blockaded two national highways that serve as lifelines for the landlocked Manipur. Prices of all commodities, including foodgrains, have skyrocketed since then, with petrol being sold at high prices on the black market.
