While there has been several big budget movies announced in Malayalam including the Rs 1000 crore Mahabharata, Mammootty’s Mamaankam will be the first to go on floors.

 The team are gearing up a short schedule on February 10, with extensive production expected to begin by May 2018. The highlight of the film, set in the late 17the century and that revolves around the life of the warriors called Chaaverukal who plot to overthrow the Zamorin rulers, will be the visual effects.
 
 To attempt the feat, the team has roped in   VFX supervisor  . On how  , which is made on a considerably low budget as compared to Bahubali, will stock up, Kamal says, “The challenge in the film is to meld the graphics with the original visuals so that the audience cannot distinguish between the two.”
 
 The movie will have extensive action sequences and most of the pre-production had the VFX team, cinematographer as well as the action choreographer working together to come up with the visuals.
 
 “We have given a brief how each character should be cast and how we can go about it,” says Kamal. “In Bahubali too there are certain sequences for which we shelled a lot of money but went unnoticed. However, there were also a few VFX scenes that received a lot of praise but was done considerably easier. So budget constraints will not limit the excellence in the graphics and Maamaankam’s VFX will be on par with Bahubali.”
 
 The film’s director Sajeev, who has also written the script, says that apart from the action sequences, Mammootty’s character will also strong emotional connect with the audience. “We want it to be as organic as possible, especially because we are doing it in Malayalam,” he says, adding that Kerala and Karnataka will be the main locations of Maamaankam.
