Hyderabadi boy   just put apna city on the national cosplaying map by winning the ‘Fan Favourite Award’ at the national   championship held in Delhi recently. It was his Daedric avatar from   that won Akhil this honour. Soon, he will pack his fibreglass armour and set off to the   Comic Con 2017. 
For Akhil, however, the   from the popular roleplayer game Skyrim is more than just a ticket to stardom in the cosplaying community. it is also an armour to fight his own battles. “I am actually a huge introvert. So in that sense, my journey from Hyderabad Comic Con to India Comic Con has been surreal. I have a lot to thank this armour for... I have started making a lot of friends and I am more open to talking to different people now,” says the 20-year-old graduate of design, VFX and animation. 
 The costume made of fibreglass and industrial resin weighs 25 kgs and cost Akhil a cool `27,000 to make. “Yea, those are hard and tough materials to work with. But I was hell-bent on making this armour because of what the character meant to me. Daedrin armour is that one thing that defeats the mightiest of the demons in the game. But since I am a novice gamer, I wasn’t very good at defeating anything despite the armour. So instead of struggling with the game, I thought I will create a real-life armour for myself and began working on it. It took five months and `27,000 to build this 25-kg armour,” he says, adding, “I spent everything I had on this!”
 But when he thinks of his upcoming Indonesia trip it all seems worth it. “Throughout, I thought I am just doing this for fun; it was never a contest in my mind. but now look where it’s taking me! Now, I am set to upgrade the armour with a shield and do some more detailing work to get ready for Indonesia,” Akhil enthuses, as he signs off.
