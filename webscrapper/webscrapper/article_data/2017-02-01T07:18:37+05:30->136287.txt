KOLKATA: A month after PM   announced a crackdown on `benami` properties, Kolkata circle of the income   department has started sending notices to those who have allegedly stashed unaccounted money into accounts in the name of other persons.

 According to sources in the I-T department, specific inputs regarding some accounts reached the department from Union finance ministry a few weeks ago. Following that, the department has sent notices to at least six people allegedly holding 'benami' property. If the allegations are found to be true prima facie, the properties will be attached by the department. “An account has already been attached after the investigators found the guilty during the preliminary inquiry,“ said a top official at the Aikar Bhavan. 'Benamidar` is a person in whose name the property is transferred or held. The benamidar person could be fictitious too.
