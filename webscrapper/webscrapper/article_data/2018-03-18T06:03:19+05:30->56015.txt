THANE: Though the relatives of the   and   on Friday have claimed the two did not know each other, cops said the teenager's parents, on coming to know of the man's death, told them to look for their missing daughter nearby. 

 Bodies of the youth, who worked as a dance teacher, and the girl were found, within metres of each other, between Diva and Niljhe stations. The police are probing if the parents were aware that the duo was going to commit suicide.
 
 The police said the girl's parents, along with some neighbours, rushed to the police station on coming to know of the dance teacher's death and insisted that the cops try to find her body at the same spot where the youth's was found. The girl's body, surprisingly, was found a few metres away. Her body had grease and oil marks, indicating a collision with a locomotive, said an officer.
 
 "The girl's family also came to the spot and trailed our officials. How they could be so confident of finding their daughter at the same spot. We will question both the families to know if they were aware of any relationship between the two," said senior inspector  . 
 
 The police suspect that the families disapproved of the duo's alliance as the youth and the girl belong to different communities. The youth's relatives have claimed he did not shown any signs of depression and had recently bought a bike. The girl was preparing for her Class IX exams, her parents told TOI.
