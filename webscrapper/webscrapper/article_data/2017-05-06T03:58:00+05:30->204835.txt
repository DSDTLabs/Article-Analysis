AHMEDABAD: The district education officers (DEOs) of Ahmedabad city, Ahmedabad rural and Ahmedabad district will meet school managements on Saturday. Representatives of some 1,200 schools will be at the meeting, which will be held at St Xavier’s Loyola Hall in Memnagar.

 The officials will brief school managements about the implementation of the Gujarat Self Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017, the new rules and regulations and the criteria for fixing fee limits. The DEOs will further direct school managements on how to tackle issues regarding the new law and managements can only levy fees of the first quarter i.e. from April to June, according to the old structure. Copies of the fee regulation law will also be provided to school managements.
 
 “We will address queries from school management about the implementation of the law. We will also inform school managements about forms to be filled for them to apply for higher fees, documents to be attached and submission time frame,” said Navin Mehta, DEO, Ahmedabad.
