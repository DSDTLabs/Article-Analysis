PATNA: Buoyed by BJP’s stunning victory in   poll, former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday thanked chief minister Nitish Kumar for not contesting in the state, which, he said, helped his party to come to power.

 “Nitish Kumar not fighting UP elections also helped BJP. Thanks to Nitishji,” he said.
 
 The senior party leader took a dig at RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, saying, “If Lalu Prasadji would not have gone to UP and abused PM  ,   could have gained 2-4 seats.”
 
 Crediting PM Narendra Modi for the party’s strong showing in the high stakes UP election, he said the resounding victory is a result of his policies like demonetisation. “Victory of BJP in UP is victory of the PM and demonetisation,” he tweeted.
 
 Showering praise on BJP national president Amit Shah,   in another tweet said Shah is “the man of the match”. “UP was able to counter anti-reservation and outsider tags which we couldn’t do in Bihar,” he said.
 
 Indirectly targeting chief minister Nitish Kumar, state BJP chief Nityanand Rai said if the entire country has accepted PM Narendra Modi as its leader, yahan ke log (people of the state) should also do the same.
 
 Rai, however, refused to comment on a possible patch up between the BJP and Nitish. The 17-year alliance between the two parties was snapped by Nitish in June 2013, after it became apparent that BJP would project Narendra Modi as its PM candidate in 2014 Lok Sabha election.
 
 Former state BJP chief Mangal Pandey said the party’s UP win has already put the house of the three-party grand alliance of the RJD, JD(U) and Congress on fire. “Now it would be interesting to see how their relations pan out,” he said.
