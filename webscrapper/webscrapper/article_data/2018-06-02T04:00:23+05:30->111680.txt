MUMBAI:   College of Arts, Science and Commerce in Sion has joined the bandwagon of autonomous colleges in the city. The college finally received the University Grants Commission’s (UGC) nod on May 28. The autonomous status has been granted to the college for a period of 10 years and will be valid till 2027-28.

 Students seeking admissions at the college can expect, among other things, early results from the upcoming academic session. In the first year, the college may not make sweeping changes in syllabus and the admissions process, said principal Uma Shankar. She added they would introduce continuous evaluation and increase the weightage given to internal assessment in the first year. “Examinations can be planned well, and timely results can be ensured. We also will use the new status to improve the brand value of the institution,” said the principal. Though the status was conferred upon the college by the UGC, it is yet to receive a notification from the state government and the parent university ( ).
 
 SIES College had been receiving Central funds under various schemes over the last few years and was picked as the best college by the university in 2009-10. Sophia College in Breach Candy and Ramniranjan Jhunjhunwala in Ghatkopar too have applied for autonomy but are awaiting UGC’s nod.
 
 SIES will join Jai Hind and Mithibai, which are likely to exercise their autonomy in the coming academic session. Meeta Rajiv Lochan, state project director of   (RUSA), said they have been conducting statewide workshops with colleges to encourage them to opt for autonomy as per the state policy. “They have apprehensions about autonomy status, especially regarding government funding, increasing research output and brand value. They want to know if the existing government funds will be discontinued after get they get autonomy and if they will be allowed to build their own brand value,” she said. But the state has made it clear existing state funds will not be discontinued.
