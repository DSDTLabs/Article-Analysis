 "So wait, one more time: Let me make sure I can actually make this official. How many people want me to date Nicki Minaj?"
 And as the crowd roared, Eminem confessed he wanted to date her too. "Well goddamnit, me too! We'll figure this s**t out. How we're gonna deal with this publicly?"
 
 And after the footage surfaced on Twitter, Minaj wrote, "Lmfao. The fact that he is silly and a goof just like me. Love him so much. We need you on the   album. That's where our first date will be; at the studio while I gaze into your beautiful eyes as you write your verse. (sic)"
