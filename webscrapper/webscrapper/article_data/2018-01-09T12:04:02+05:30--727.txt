 The 34-year-old actor will be next seen in  , alongside other veterans, such as Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr,  ,   and  . 
  
  
  will mark the final outing for Hemsworth as Thor. 
 
 "If I had the opportunity to do it again, I think I'd love to. I also think there's an appetite for it now, or there's a far greater range of possibilities of where he can go now, what he can do, just because we've kind of broke the mould a bit," Hemsworth told. 
 
 "I've just, literally two days ago, finished 'Avengers 4' and that's my contract - my pre-existing contract is done now, so it's kind of like 'wow, that's it'," he added. 
 
 Hemsworth, who last appeared in the Taika Waititi- directed  , said he has rediscovered his passion for the role. 
 
 "Two or three films ago I was like 'okay, a couple more'. I was enjoying it but I was like... I felt a little restricted. And after this last experience with Taika, and actually these last two 'Avengers', I feel like we've reinvented that character a number of times - even in these next two, he evolves again, and you don't get that opportunity often in a franchise."
 
 "So I definitely feel a renewed sense of excitement and enthusiasm, and more so than ever, I think," Hemsworth said.
