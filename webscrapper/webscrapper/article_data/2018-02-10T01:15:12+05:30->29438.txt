MUMBAI:   Opposition leader Ravi Raja on Friday said the   would oppose any move to clear the   as it offered commuters nothing.

 The budget encouraged an unwarranted fare rise, said Raja. “Why should commuters pay more fare when there is no improvement in quality of service?” he said. 
 
 The budget proposes a fare increase in the range of Rs 1 to Rs 12 for distances over 4 km.
 
 Civic chief Ajoy Mehta, too, reiterated in his BMC budget speech that all help to BEST would be based on “clearly definable deliverables and improvement of efficiency parameters”.
 
 The BEST budget has a deficit of Rs 377 crore and the undertaking is in urgent need of a “special grant” from the BMC. Sources said the BMC had not made any provision for such grants in its own budget and that aid was unlikely till BEST implemented all suggested reforms like a cut in dearness allowance. 
 
 “We will not let the DA cut happen, and will go to industrial court,” BEST Workers’ Union leader Shashank Rao said.
 
 The ruling   is likely to seek an amendment in the budget to make a provision of Rs 377 crore to clear the deficit.
