Filmmaker   has always ensured that his movies have been an entertaining ride for the audience - be it Aadu Oru Bheegarajeeviaanu or  . So, the expectations of his latest movie   has been of a family entertainer. 

 The first half of the movie, which has Sunny Wayne and Aditi Ravi in the lead, sets the story up nicely. The film is about how the lead couple meet while misunderstandings drive their families apart. Sunny plays Arun Pavithran who falls for Swathi played by Aditi. The petty egos of their parents though come in way and make for some good LOL moments till and after their wedding.
 
 The first half though is predictable, making the movie less engaging. The dialogues and instances too are oft heard and the movie lacks that novel punch. Sunny looks natural in the part of the passive bank employee. However it's Seema G Nair and   who steal the show in the first half.
 
 The misunderstandings of the families seem to only heighten after a cupboard, which is given as a gift to the couple becomes a hassle. The film also has a parallel track with Arun and his friends and how their property in Bengaluru becomes a bone of contention.
