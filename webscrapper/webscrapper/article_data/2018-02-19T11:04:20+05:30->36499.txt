KANNUR: Amid the charges that the police failed to nab the killers of   at Edayannur near Mattannur in the district on February 12, two   have been arrested, though the party leadership claimed it has no role in the murder.

 According to police, the two have been identified as Akash M V (24) and Rejin Raj (26), and they have also been named accused in the murder of   at Thillankery in September 2016.
 
 It was on Sunday morning that the police took them into custody amid speculations that they actually surrendered in Maloor police station accompanied by a few local CPM leaders.
 
 Though the CPM claimed that the party has no role in the murder of Shuhaib, the social media was flooded with the photographs of the two youths with senior party leaders including P Jayarajan and  , which has put the party on defensive foot.
 
 Meanwhile, the chief minister broke his silence and condemned the murder and said that the he had given instruction to the police to nab the accused at the earliest. He also said the political affiliation of the killers will not affect the investigation.
 
 Incidentally, the CPM workers were held even as the Congress strengthened the campaign and senior party leader K Sudhakaran is going to launch a 48-hour agitation from Monday. Hence the party is also of the feeling that the two in custody could be proxy accused to save the real killers.
 
 “I don't think the ones in police custody are the real accused but this has shattered the claim made by the CPM that the party has no role in the murder of Shuhaib,” he said.
 
  also said that the party will not stop the campaign till the real killers are booked.
 
 The accused will be presented in the court on Monday.
