Kolhapur: The civic body will initiate the process to procure equipment needed to set up an Intensive Care Unit ( ) at its Savitribai Phule  .

 The decision comes three years after the district planning and development council ( ) sanctioned Rs 1 crore to set up the facility. 
 
 The funds were sanctioned under ‘Novel Schemes’ by the DPDC which is the apex body to undertake development projects across the district. Along with the ICU, the DPDC also approved setting up of an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). Setting up the ICU is important as a hospital without ICU cannot be empanelled in the state's health insurance scheme, under which over 800 surgical procedures are carried out free of cost for poor patients.
 
 A senior Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ( ) officer said, “The tender to procure the necessary equipment will be floated over the next few days. Estimates of electrical and civil work have been completed and work will begin once funds are released.”
 
 A civic official said the process to set up the ICU has been stuck because of technical issues and the DPDC had demanded clarifications over some issues.
 
 The KMC is hoping that the ICU will help increase patient numbers. Over 25 hospitals, mostly private, are at present empanelled under the insurance scheme. The poor patients are undergoing treatment at these private hospitals and the expenses are made through the state government’s finances.
 
 Deliveries of pregnant women currently take place at the Savitribai Phule Hospital and the KMC has decided to set up the panel of the renowned surgeons from the city to carry out various operations at the ICU facility. 
 
 “We do not have sufficient number of surgeons with us to run the facility. We will recruit at least 15 surgical experts in various domains on an honorary basis. Once the ICU facility is set up, we will appeal to practicing surgeons to come and perform the operations for poor patients,” the official said.
