HYDERABAD: The Centre's proposal for 350 online courses free of cost through `Swayam' platform would benefit students, especially poor, looking for jobs in the information technology (IT) and allied sector in the city. Anyone in higher secondary class can pursue a `Swayam' course.

 Thousands of students in Hyderabad pay huge sums for IT courses in institutions in areas such as Ameerpet and Dilsukhnagar and the plan, if successful, would ensure they would save this money. `Swayam' would hopefully also bridge the digital divide between rural and urban students and help them log on to mainstream knowledge economy.
 
 Till now internet and broadband connectivity, credibility of course provider, lack of interactive classes have been barriers for online education and students naturally opted for traditional classes. `Swayam' is now intended to make e-learning more popular. Finance minister   also plans a tie-up with DTH channels to expand the reach of online courses offered through `Swayam'.
 
 A survey conducted by an online education portal last year had revealed that digital learning was most popular in southern India.
 
 “A majority of millennials and Gen Z prefer self-learning. The challenge is to get them interested in a virtual platform. Focussed efforts to enhance awareness and encourage educational institutes to introduce and adopt these online technologies will be a key in scaling up and enhancing the pace of learning,“ said  , chief operating officer of   and Knowledge.
