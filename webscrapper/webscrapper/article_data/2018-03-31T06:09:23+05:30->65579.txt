LUCKNOW: Junior Union minister and   (RPI-A) chief   says   wave is waning and BJP may be staring at a loss of around 25 seats in UP in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. 

 "The situation is not like 2014 when Narendra Modi's popularity was at its peak. The coming together of   and SP may take away Dalit and backward-dominated seats. BJP and its allies are likely to get about 50 seats in comparison to 73 they had won in 2014," Athawale, an NDA ally, said on Friday.
 
 Athawale, however, said the NDA government's focus on public welfare would favour BJP in 2019.
 
 Before the recent Rajya Sabha elections, another BJP ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar had accused the Yogi Adityanath government of being corrupt. Recently, TDP pulled out from the NDA government, accusing BJP of not keeping its promises to Andhra Pradesh.
 
 UP BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan, however, denied that   wave is waning. “Under PM Narendra Modi and president Amit Shah, BJP is invincible,” he told TOI.
 
 He denied reports that the NDA was trying to change the Constitution. “It’s a rumour being spread by opposition parties,” he said.
 
 Supporting addition of ‘Ramji’ in BR Ambedkar’s name, Athawale said it was a practice in Maharashtra to add father’s name. “It does not signify any association with Ram, as rumoured,” he said.
