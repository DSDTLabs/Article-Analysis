BHUBANESWAR: Twelve people had to be taken to the hospital after they were attacked by   on the premises of the state secretariat on Thursday. The incident took place just minutes before chief minister  's arrival at the secretariat, forcing him to take the back door to reach his office on the third floor. 

 Hundreds of tribals from different parts of the state had gathered at the secretariat lawn. Suddenly a swarm of bees swooped down upon them, catching them unawares. As people ran for cover, many were stung. Some even jumped into the fountain to escape the attack. 
 
 Around 50 people, including tribal women and children, were stung out of whom 12 had to be taken to  . Later, nine were released after first aid and three had to be hospitalised. "No one was seriously injured though many had swelling on their faces and other parts of the body," said Dr  , deputy medical superintendent of Capital Hospital.
 
 "A swarm of honey bees came buzzing towards the gathering and stung following which people started running. While some ran all over the lawns, a few lay on the ground, covering their faces. Government officials and mediapersons went inside the secretariat building," said a security personnel deployed at the main entrance of the secretariat.
 
 The bees are said to have appeared from the hives located near the flag posts atop the secretariat.
 
 Tribal development minister   and senior officials of his department visited the Capital Hospital to take stock of the situation.
