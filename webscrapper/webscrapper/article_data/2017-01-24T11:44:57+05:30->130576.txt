BHOPAL: In a major setback for Madhya Pradesh government, the   has rejected the state's proposal to include Shaurya Smarak and   tableau during the January 26   on Rajpath. 

 Sources in the state government say that the defence ministry has not given any valid reason for the refusal. Officers concerned however say that it was a routine matter."We had presented a good model of the Shaurya Smarak before the selection committee but they were not interested. There would not be any tableau from MP this time," said a government officer.During the last Republic Day parade, Madhya Pradesh had a tableau with the theme 'save tiger, save forest' - based on white tiger safari of Mukundpur zoo and was widely appreciated. 
 
 "It is not a big issue. They do not take models from each state every year. Only around 12 to 15 tableaus are allowed in the parade. We are assured that they would include our tableau next year," said S K Mishra, PS to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.
