Kolkata: Worried about fewer companies hiring students from campuses, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, earlier called WBUT, has decided to hold a conclave at Milan Mela Grounds between March 27 and 29, where affiliated colleges will showcase their innovations, project handling skills, and support to industry. This, to inculcate a culture of entre-preneurship in graduates. 

 Industry representatives will attend the event, where the scope for financing innovative ideas will be discussed. “Currently, affiliated colleges record an average of 30% placements. The placement season will be on till July, but the offers are not too encouraging. We hope the process will receive a boost from a combined effort of the university, colleges and employers,” said vice-chancellor Saikat Maitra. 
 
 “We plan to set up a common software development centre and take up large projects by pooling in the resources at our colleges. The industry representatives will also suggest how to revamp our syllabus.”
 
 The VC pointed to reasons for the slowdown: “Recession has come as a setback for hiring engineers for the core industries. The market is not growing enough to accommodate the new graduates. We need to go in for startup incubation and micro-level entrepreneurship.”
