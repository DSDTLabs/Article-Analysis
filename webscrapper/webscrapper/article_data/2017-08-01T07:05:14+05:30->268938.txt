KOLKATA: The Gujarat Police in association with the   special task force (STF) have detained a 22-year-old youth from the Entally market area late on Sunday for his alleged involvement in the smuggling of 1,500kg of heroin which was seized near Porbandar — making it the biggest haul in the country. The product, worth Rs 3,500 crore, was being smuggled aboard the MV Henry.

 Although the Navy and the Coast Guard had detained the captain and seven crew members, four police forces — UP STF, Maharashtra ATS, Gujarat ATS and Kolkata Police STF — joined forces with other central agencies and the IB to carry out further arrests.
 
 Police said the youth detained for questioning was ship captain Suprit Tiwari’s younger brother. On Sunday, several documents, laptops and other items were seized from the Girish Ghosh Road residence of the brothers.
 
 According to STF sources, the younger brother — a BTech final-year student from a Sodepur engineering college — had received direct communication from Suprit about a Rs 50-crore payout for a particular shipment. Suprit had also asked his brother to meet some men in Kolkata, Surat and Mumbai to arrange for the money that would reach them via hawala routes. 
 
 “The younger brother was aware of the plan. We have handed him over to Gujarat Police, who are now trying to track the drug-hawala route in Kolkata,” explained a source.
 
 STF sources said they will probe the hawala angle separately, although the main investigation will lie with cops from Gujarat and Maharashtra.
 
 The vessel which Suprit was commanding was operating under the name MV Henry and was using the Panama flag. Several documents belonging to the two brothers have been seized by STF to ascertain how Suprit found employment with the ship. The owner, based in Dubai, however, claimed the ship was going to Alang to be dismantled.
