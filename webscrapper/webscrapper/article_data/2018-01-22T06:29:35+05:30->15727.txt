AMRITSAR: The cultural affairs department on Sunday released Rs 11 crore for the development of Durgiana temple project. The announcement to the effect was made by minister   here while reviewing the ongoing beautification project at the temple.

 Sidhu asked officials to complete the project, which was running behind the schedule, by June 30. He also took a round of the entire open plaza being built beyond the entry point of the Durgiana temple.
 
 Interacting with mediapersons, he said that out of the Rs 11 crore, Rs 2 crore had been released from the   to address issues related to electricity. “As the Punjab infrastructure   (PIDB) could not have done this immediately, I have released the money from the trust. Money will be no hindrance for this prestigious project,” he assured.
 
 He also claimed that the previous SAD-BJP government had released only around Rs 6 crore for the entire project which he had now raised to Rs 11 crore. “This is a place where many pilgrims come to pay obeisance and thousands of tourists also visit, so it needs a complete revamp” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, in wake of recent spree of snatchings in Amritsar, Sidhu said he would take up the issue with chief minister  . On Sunday, Sidhu visited the family of victim of a snatching incident in Green Avenue area and said that snatching had become a big problem while adding in the same breath that the   government was serious on the issue.
 
 “There are no excuses and I personally feel sorry for the incident. The victim is like my sister and it can happen to anyone. It can happen to my daughter also. So this is our duty to stand by you all and come to you at such time,” said Sidhu while talking to the father of women who became prey to the snatchers near the house of Union home minister Arun Jaitely a few days ago.
 
 The minister was also accompanied by Amritsar police commissioner S S Srivastava.
