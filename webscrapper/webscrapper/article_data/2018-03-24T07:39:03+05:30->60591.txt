HYDERABAD: Speaking in the  , municipal administration minister   on Friday outlined various plans for the city, including a 10TMC reservoir near   to meet the city’s drinking water needs.

 The minister further said that 20 city lakes will be beautified with a budget of Rs 288 crore. He said sewerage treatment would be done and walking tracks laid there. Within the ORR limits, another 15 lakes will be beautified by the HMDA.
 
  said the chief minister would lay the foundation stone for a drinking water reservoir of 10 TMC to be constructed near Shamirpet. “This, and other measures, will ensure that there is no drinking water problem in the city," he said.
 
 He said in a 46km area around   lake would be beautified at a cost of Rs 100 crore by 2020, when the lake turns 100. “It will be developed in such a manner that it will become a week-end destination,” he said.
