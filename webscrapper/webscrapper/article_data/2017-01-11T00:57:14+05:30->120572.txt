CHENNAI: Forty-one Indian sailors, including a few from Tamil Nadu, who have been   without salaries on four ships off the Ajman coast in the  , could soon get help.

 Minister for external affairs   has directed officials at the Indian consulate in Dubai to extend all assistance to the sailors. The move comes after the sailors sent an appeal to the minister on Twitter, saying they were struggling for months without wages on four ships, owned by one company, about 9km from Ajman port and that they wanted to return home desperately. One of the stranded men is from Sankarankoil in Tirunelveli, while another is from Puducherry.
 
 Manoj Joy, Chennai-based Port Chaplain of the sailors society who is liasing between the Indian consulate in Dubai and the sailors’ families, said the society had been providing moral and financial support to the sailors’ families during this period.
 
 “From the WhatsApp messages the sailors sent us, the essential supplies may last two weeks,” he said. Manoj said the situation was desperate as two of the ships had allegedly developed leaks.
 
 Sources at the Indian consulate in Dubai told TOI the issue had been taken up on a priority with the UAE authorities.
 
 In a press release, the consulate said officials had established contact with captains of two of the vessels. “The consulate has spoken to the sponsor and sought his assistance for settlement of all issues with the crew on priority basis,” it said.
