AHMEDABAD: Three persons including a minor have been arrested by   for setting ablaze a builder’s office.

 Those arrested have been identified as Mohammed Hasim Shaikh and Mohammed Tufel Shaikh. The minor accused has been sent to observation home.
 
 According to police, Hasim and Tufel had a quarrel with a man near electricity house in Shahpur, a few days ago. “Builder Gulam Moiuddin’s brother Zuber intervened and reprimanded Hasim and Tufel. Later both were detained by Shahpur police under section 151 of the Crpc,” said a police official.
 
 Hasim and Tufel thought that it was because of Zuber’s intervention that they had been put behind bars, and hence, they decided to avenge the insult.
 
 “On Monday night, Hasim, Tufel and their minor friend put on masks and poured petrol in Zuber’s office, located near electricity house, and set it ablaze. Zuber’s brother Moiuddin lodged a complaint with   in this regard. Zuber identified both Hasim and Tufel, even though their faces had been covered at the time of the incident, through their body language,” said the official.
