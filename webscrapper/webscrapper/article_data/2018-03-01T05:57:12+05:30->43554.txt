Bengaluru has a long way to go in self-sufficiency, civic society activists and urban experts said, pointing out that cities like Mumbai and Pune were far less dependent on state funds.

 Sapna Karim, head of Civic Participation at  , said BBMP’s dependency on state grants is down to 39% from 51% this year. “However, we still do not see the   aspiring to become more self-sufficient. Property tax is the biggest source of own revenues. This year’s collection is 68% of the planned target of Rs 2,600 crore, lower than the last two years. The GIS-based property identification project, if implemented, could more than double the property tax potential of the city,” she said.
 
 A team of experts from Janaagraha, who have analysed the BBMP budget, said between 2013-14 and 2017-18, the civic body’s own revenue as a percentage of total receipts has averaged at 45%. “However, BBMP has set itself an aggressive own revenue target of 56% of total receipts in 2018-19. Cities like Pune and Mumbai have recorded more than 60%,” said an expert.
 
 Urban expert ASK Pani said, “Sadly, Bengaluru always gets in the middle of the bad game of politics between state and central government and also within party politics in the local government.”
 
 BBMP commissioner  , however, said they were hopeful of reaching the revenue targets. On allegations of non-implementation of budget promises from 2017-18, the commissioner said the financial year has been highest implementation rate at 76%.
 
 “We have been able to improve the fiscal health of BBMP in the past few years. Many mortgaged properties have been taken back and we have not taken any fresh loans,” he said.
