Tuticorin: Two years after the Sri Lankan navy seized six country boats for allegedly entering that country’s territorial waters, one of them, belonging to Bhaskar of Puthu Theru in Tuticorin district was brought back home on Tuesday. 

 Bhaskar’s boat and the other five were impounded by the Lankan navy on September 29, 2015. While the seven fishermen who were on these boats were released in November the same year, their boats continued to be kept in their custody at Kalpatti beach for more than two years.
 
 In June this year, the Sri Lankan government agreed to release the 42 boats on condition that the fishermen would never enter that country’s territorial waters. Following these developments, Bhaskar and four other fishermen set off to Sri Lanka on an Indian Coast Guard (ICG) ship on September 30, to bring his boat back home.
 
 The ship took them to International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL), from where the Lankan navy took them to Kalpatti beach. After carrying out basic repairs the team started to tow the boat to Tuticorin at 5.30am on Monday. 
 
 Escorted by the Lankan navy, they reached the IMBL, from where the ICG took them to Therespuram in the district around Tuesday afternoon.
