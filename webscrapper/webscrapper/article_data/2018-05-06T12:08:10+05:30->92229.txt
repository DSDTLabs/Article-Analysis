PANCHKULA: Now,   girls need not go to Chandigarh or some other place to get admission in regular courses.

 As per the information given by the college authorities, they had sent a proposal to start five new courses in the college to   higher education department. From a list of five subjects, the higher education department has approved three for the girls' college.
 
 Principal   said that 40 seats are available for admission in each course. 
 
 "Earlier for these courses, students had to take admission in colleges in Chandigarh and nearby areas. But now, they are available in their own city as well."
