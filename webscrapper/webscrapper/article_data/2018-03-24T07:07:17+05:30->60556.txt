BENGALURU: The recently relaid Church Street, built as per the TenderSURE model, in the heart of the central business district (CBD), has become the focus of widespread appreciation and entails features like uniform carriageways, wide pavements and on-road parking. 

 According to   (BBMP) officials, several delegations from across the country have visited the IT City, interested in the make and design of the roads and keen on implementing the model in their hometowns. Delegations from the municipal corporations of Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata and New Delhi have paid visits in the past two years.

 “In Bengaluru I visited Church St & St.Marks road... A movement seems afoot to reclaim key streets for pedestrians. I applaud this move. I may be a car-maker but I believe one way of making our cities liveable is to make some parts pedestrian-only,” he tweeted on March 21.
 
 The chief minister tweeted back in agreement: “We agree. The city’s future lies in public transport (metro/sub-urban rail/city bus service) bicycles & pedestrianization. We have made a beginning and this is the way forward for #Bengaluru. #AtHomeInBengaluru.”
 
 The TenderSURE road network is all set to get bigger in the city with tenders being called for 17 more stretches earlier this month.
 
 K T Nagaraj, chief engineer (project central), BBMP, said the city’s TenderSURE roads have wowed several delegations. “Representatives from various cities have inspected TenderSURE works. None of the other cities has roads of this quality with so many provisions. Under the Smart City project, teams from Davanagere, Belagavi and Tumakuru have visited. Municipal corporation delegates from Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and Andhra Pradesh have also examined the works,” he elaborated.
