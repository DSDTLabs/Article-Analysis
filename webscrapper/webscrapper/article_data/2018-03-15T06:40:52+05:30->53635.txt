CHENNAI: Violations in fixing pay for teaching staff in government and aided   in   and other procedural lapses resulted in a loss of Rs 125 crore, an   report has said. 

 The higher education department received several complaints over procedures followed by the collegiate education directorate in pay fixation under the   (CAS), rectification of anomalies in salaries of seniors compared to juniors and release of incentives for M Phils/Ph Ds. 
 
 
  
 
 Subsequently, the audit was taken up in all 241 government and aided colleges and the final report, a copy of which is available with TOI, was submitted a few months ago. 
 
 Government orders and   (UGC) norms were violated in all three procedures, the audit noted. While anomalies in salaries of seniors can be rectified only by comparing it with juniors in the same discipline, comparison was made with those from other disciplines. 
 
 Similarly, incentives can be given for acquiring Ph Ds/M Phils only if they are from the discipline in which the staff currently work. However, incentives were given to those with degrees from other disciplines. There were several other procedural lapses which made the state pay more than Rs 100 crore to undeserving candidates, it said. 
 
 The government paid nearly Rs 55 crore in excess when orders were passed in 2009 re-designating a section of staff associate professors (APs) as per pay commission recommendations. Readers without a Ph D degree were re-designated APs with selection grade lecturers. 
 
 Weeks after receiving the report, collegiate education director   in a February 2 letter urged all regional joint directors to submit an action-taken report on the violations pointed out.
