MARGAO: In an effort to solve the frequent water supply woes of his   constituents,   on Monday spoke of laying a new 300mm pipeline from   to Navelim.

 Faleiro made this remark while inaugurating the new 440 volts electric transformer installed near the Mandopa grounds in Navelim. 
 
 The Navelim MLA said, “This new transformer will solve two issues – the frequent power interruptions and low voltage problems faced by local residents of this ward. It will also assist the PWD that have a water reservoir nearby as they encounter difficulties while pumping water due to the voltage problems. After much dillydallying between the two government departments, I have succeeded in getting this transformer installed as the government has no funds.”
 
 Faleiro said he had spoken to power minister   and stressed on the urgent need for a new transformer for this village. “He has assured me that within the next four day, he will provide another transformer. This will permanently solve the problem of voltage fluctuations. This new transformer will be installed near the Dr   district library behind the Navelim church,”he said.
