NOIDA: Owners of plots in Noida will not be able to pay   after September 30 as they will have to pay it annually from next month. As banks are closed on September 29 and 30, the last date to pay the rent in banks is September 28. However, the allottees will be able to deposit the lease rent online till September 30. 

 In June this year,   had revised the norms for collecting the lease rent from allottees. So far, the cash-strapped   has collected Rs 109 crore from allottees who have deposited the one-time lease rent.
 
 Till now, allottees had an option for paying a one-time lease rent, which meant paying the lease rent for 11 years together. This means that the property owner will be leased the property for a period of 99 years by Noida Authority. Presently, Noida charges lease rent starting from 0-5% upwards. Each category of property is charged a different lease rent, which is charged on the total allotment money, officials said.
 
 “Since the scheme was announced in June this year, we have collected more than Rs 100 crore from allottees as one time lease rent,” said Manmohan Mishra, financial controller. “However, the land where third party rights are involved, such as group housing plots where a builder further sub-leases the property to a buyer, the practice of paying one-time lease rent will be continued,” he explained.
 
 In June, the Authority had also proposed hiking the lease rent it charges from allottees by one-and-half times to generate revenue. The lease rent is supposed to be reviewed and revised upwards every ten years by 50%. “But the Noida Authority has not revised its lease rent since it was established in 1976,”said Mishra. “If the lease rent is hiked it will enable us to generate revenue and dispense municipal services for the city. Our financial situation will also improve,” he explained. Currently, Noida Authority is dealing with an Rs 20,000 crore outstanding amount due to it from several builders with projects in the city.
