Chandigarh: A day after Punjab sports minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi said the state government would not organise the circle style Kabaddi World Cup as was done by the previous SAD-BJP regime, the Shiromani Akali Dal on Tuesday said he was “assassinating the mother of sports.”

 Former Akali minister and Punjab Kabaddi Association president Sikander Singh Maluka said by removing circle kabaddi from the state government’s sports calendar, Sodhi proposes to destroy the future of thousands of youth in Punjab. He added the sports minister should know that circle kabaddi was the sport of choice of thousands of youth in Punjab.
 
 “We will not allow this to happen and will oppose this perfidious conspiracy tooth and nail,” said Maluka.
 
 “All our rural melas host circle kabaddi tournaments. It is because of the vast number of talented circle style kabaddi players that the World Cup, which was started in 2010, has become such a big success,” he added. Maluka also said circle kabaddi is popular in Pakistan as well as Sri Lanka and Nepal and is now played in Africa, Australia, Europe and America.
 
 The former minister said Punjab government’s sports department has always supported circle kabaddi. He said the sports department has given recognition to circle kabaddi and it is in the gradation list for admission in colleges and professional institutions and also for award of government jobs.
 
 The SAD leader also said Sodhi should know that the sports department supports circle kabaddi and even gives youth refreshment allowance. “The circle kabaddi tournaments are held at the state and national level. Recently, a national circle kabaddi tournament was held in Chandigarh in which Punjab boys and girls emerged victorious,” he added.
