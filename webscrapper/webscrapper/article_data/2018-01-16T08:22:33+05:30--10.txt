LUCKNOW:   chief   chose her birthday on Monday to attack   and   and accused the two of conspiring to finish her party. She said both BJP and Congress were invoking   to misguide dalits to weaken BSP. 

 Sporting her trademark diamond earrings and pink suit, which she wears on her birthdays, she said, "It is only, and only BSP which follows the principles of Ambedkar and works for and among the poor and downtrodden."
 
 Mayawati used the occasion to draw parallels between her resignation from the Rajya Sabha for not being allowed to speak on dalit atrocities with Ambedkar's exit as law minister. She accused right-wing forces of orchestrating caste violence in Saharanpur.
 
 In her 45 minutes address that was aired live and shown to BSP cadres across Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati built a strong 'Bahujan' narrative contrary to the 'Sarvajan' formula she had been pushing to take along other communities, especially upper caste Hindus and Muslims, to win elections. "BJP is hatching a conspiracy to do away with reservation benefits for dalits," Mayawati said while accusing the saffron party of tampering with the Constitution. She alleged that BJP was promoting big business houses and ignoring the poor. On the face-off between CJI Deepak Mishra and four senior judges of the Supreme Court, she said the judiciary had played the role of opposition.
