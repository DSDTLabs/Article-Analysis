PANAJI: Travel options for the differently enabled offers an untapped potential for the   industry and can generate three times the business than an individual  . 

 However, acceptance by the industry and creation of infrastructure by the government are some of the critical stumbling blocks, said visually challenged psychologist Divyanshu Ganatra on Wednesday.
 
 Speaking at the launch of Cox & Kings specially designed travel itineraries for people with disabilities, Ganatra went on to say that while Goa had sufficient infrastructure to cater to the visually challenged, facilities for the physically challenged were a bit inadequate.
 
 “You have to be a bit careful about itineraries for wheelchair-bound individuals,” said Ganatra, who is an advisor for the Cox & Kings initiative under the Enable Travel vertical.
 
 Enable Travel aims to provide tours and carefully crafted leisure outings for people with disabilities across mobility (wheelchairs), hearing, speech and vision impairment.
 
 “Enable Travel will introduce quality transportation in the form of wheelchair accessible vehicles, aids and accessories like ramps and an assortment of specialized wheelchairs for those whoare wheelchair bound,” Enable Travel head, Debolin Sen said. 
 
 “Support services also include investments in specially trained manpower such as caregivers, sign language interpreters, expert guides and escorts, making all areas of travel accessible to travellers,” Sen added. 
 
 Enable Travel has launched in 14 cities and Cox & Kings is looking to expand its operations in a second phase on a quarterly basis.
 
 “People with disabilities have always wanted to travel, but there were many barriers. Mobility and accessibility has to improve,” Sen said.
