 Singh, too, went out to meet his friends. About 15 minutes later, Digambar returned with his licensed pistol and shot his father. Everyone around Singh ran for cover. Suman was near the main door of the house. After finishing with his father, Digambar fired at Suman. She was hit twice. 
 
 Digambar then fled the scene. A neighbour took the couple to a hospital where Singh was declared dead on arrival and Suman was admitted in a critical condition.
 
 Digambar was arrested while trying to flee the city. “He has confessed to his crime,” said DCP (outer) M N Tiwari.
