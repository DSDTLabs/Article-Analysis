Navi Mumbai: While GVK-led Mumbai International   Ltd (MIAL) won the bid to build the Rs 16,000-crore project, there were some tense moments on Monday. 

  senior officers, led by MD Bhushan Gagrani, and the bidders were closeted for a short span of time. GVK's offer of 12.60 % year over year (YOY) share from annual gross revenue was not only higher, but worked out to be more than GMR's 10.44%. 
 
 The GVK group also had the right of first refusal, which meant if its bid was within 10% of the highest bid, it could still match the bid to bag the project. R K Jain, CEO, MIAL, told TOI, “The right of first refusal can make one complacent.”
 
 Cidco got the two bidders after it tweaked the RFP (request for proposal), which closed on Monday, to encourage more than one bidder. 
 
 GVK-led MIAL had been the sole bidder the first two times, after which Cidco went for third extension, as per Central Vigilance Commission guidelines, which mandates minimum two extensions.
 
 The changes, made after the second extension and described by Cidco MD, Bhushan Gagrani as clarification, did get the desired results. Siddharth Kapur, president (finance and business development), GMR Airports, said that they bid because of the relaxations.
 
 In order to ensure more   Cidco redefined the project cost to make it less risky for financial institutions/banks if project is terminated midway. It also gave the strategic partner the freedom to appoint its CEO and CFOs without waiting for approval. Cidco also offered to defer the payment of soft loan (about Rs 3,500 crore), which it had spent on pre-development works. Earlier, the payment had to start from the date of appointment of the strategic partner but now it has been deferred to date of completion of the project.
