When it comes to eye make-up, yellow eye shadow seems a bit experimental. But this shade isnâ€™t as crazy as it sounds! This sunny shade is a perfect pick for summers and even   is a fan. In the last few days, she can be seen sporting this make-up look with her different outfits. 

 
 
 
 From her black jacket to her pink jumpsuit, Priyanka is working this cheerful shade like a pro. And even you can pull it off like PeeCee, as this shade flatters every skin tone. For fairer skin tones, one can pick pastel hues while amber shades go well with the deeper complexion. 
 
  
  
 Here are few tricks to keep in mind:
 
 1. To make the colour pop, prep your lids with a white eye shadow or concealer to make the pigment more vibrant. 
 
 2. If yellow makes your eyes look too dull, complete the look with a black liner and tonnes of mascara. Here, the black liner will help to define your lids. 
 
 3. Keep the rest of the make-up minimal and not going OTT.
 
 4. You can also glam it up with a layer of gold shadow to work the yellow-gold hue.
