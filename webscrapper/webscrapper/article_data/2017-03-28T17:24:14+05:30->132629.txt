 All Women   gets registered in   of Records 
 
 All Women Bike Rally(AWBR), which has become a symbol of women's freedom and liberation, recently got registered in Limca Book of Records under the category Largest All Women Bike Rally. 
  
 An initiative of Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd - Languages Division, the 2016 edition of the rally attracted a record participation riding two-wheelers in 10 cities across the country. The rallies were held simultaneously in Aurangabad, Bengaluru, Delhi, Kolhapur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Nagpur, Nasik, Pune and Thane on 13th March 2016. Like every year, women from all walks of life participated in the rally, asserting their independence and breaking traditional gender stereotypes. 
  
  AWBR as a concept was seeded 5 years back by Navbharat Times, post the horrific Nirbhaya incident, with an objective to encourage women to reclaim their city without any fear. This program empowered the women of Delhi and gave them a tangible and constructive symbol through which they asserted themselves with pride and confidence. The rally was the concluding event for this campaign & since then has become a must go event for everyone to express solidarity with the cause & celebrate women hood. 
  
 In 2014, AWBR got recognized by   (INMA) & was awarded a Gold in the category of Events to Build a News Brand.
