BATHINDA: Gangster Nikka Jatana, in his   post, has claimed responsibility for killing liquor contractor and   activist Sukhwinder Singh Bangi. Sukhwinder (35) of Jatana Kaplan village in Mansa was killed on the evening of May 21 by unknown people who pumped six bullets into his body.

 
 The victim was going towards his village in a car when he was attacked by the assailants following him another vehicle. The victim, Sukhwinder, had been booked in a   case nearly three years ago.
 
 In his post on Facebook on the night of May 21, Nikka, claiming to be a member of slain gangster Davinder Bambiha’s group, wrote that Sukhwinder had fatally shot his friend   by firing three bullets on May 29, 2015. “Now, I have taken revenge by pumping six bullets into him,” he wrote.
 
 Police have taken serious note of the FB post and term the killing as a case of personal enmity. Though Nikka has been named in the case, police are investigating his role as well as that of two of his accomplices. They have conducted raids at the home of one of Nikka’s accomplices.
 
 Mansa deputy superintendent of police (DSP)   said, “Police have checked the Facebook post and are investigating the matter. Raids have been conducted at the possible hideouts of Nikka and his accomplices who are suspected to be behind the incident.”
 
 Sources said a few people were keeping an eye on Sukhwinder after he was named in Raju’s murder case and had spent some time in jail as well.
 
 Meanwhile, the family members cremated the mortal remains of Sukhwinder on Tuesday. His family had asked the police to arrest Nikka and his accomplices for allegedly killing Sukhwinder.
