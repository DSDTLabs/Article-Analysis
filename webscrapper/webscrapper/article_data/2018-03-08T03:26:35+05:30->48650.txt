MUMBAI: The state consumer commission has upheld a district forum order directing a Borivli doctor to pay Rs 5 lakh   to a patient for a botched-up cataract   in 2009. The state commission dismissed the appeal submitted by Dr Hitesh Chheda and directed him to pay an additional Rs 25,000 to the patient, Ramesh Dedhia, as costs.

 Referring to documents submitted before it, the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission said Dedhia’s vision in the left eye had diminished after the operation. The commission found that the doctor having noticed the history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension of the patient did not insist upon fitness certificate for him to undergo the   operation and had also implanted lens that had expired two months before the surgery.
 
 Considering the reasons, the commission said it not find anything illegal in the forum’s awarding compensation to the complainant. Chheda had submitted the appeal before the commission last year in light of the forum order pronounced on December 19, 2016, against him and Asian Eye Institute & Laser Centre. The forum had held them responsible for carelessness (negligence and unfair trade practice).
 
 In the complaint before the forum in 2010, Dedhia said he had defective vision in the right eye in 2007, and Chheda conducted a cataract operation on him. Dedhia added that he underwent another surgery in October 2009, after he suffered blurred vision in the left eye. A day after the surgery, Dedhia went for check-up and was advised to use eye drops. Dedhia alleged that he noticed swelling around his left eye and his vision continued to remain blurred. He told the forum that the empty packet of the lens used for implant was given to him after the surgery and his daughter noticed that the lens had an expiry date of August 2009, two months before the operation.
