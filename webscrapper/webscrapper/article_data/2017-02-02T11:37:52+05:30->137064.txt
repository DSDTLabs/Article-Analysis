MADURAI: In a major setback,  's aide and AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala and her nephew and former MP T T V Dinakaran are set to face prosecution in the cases filed by the   (ED) two decades ago. The cases relate to offences committed under the   (FERA).

 In 1996, the ED registered four cases against Sasikala and two against Dinakaran under FERA. Seeking to discharge them from the cases, they filed petitions before the economic offences court in Chennai. The judge, R Dakshinamoorthy, passed orders on May 18, 2015, discharging Sasikala from one case and Dinakaran from both the cases.
 
 Challenging the lower court's orders discharging the accused, the ED preferred an appeal before the Madras high court. Sasikala also preferred an appeal challenging the court's orders against her discharge in the other three cases.
 
 Justice G Chockalingam heard all the matters. According to the ED, the Indian Bank's Abhiramapuram branch gave `3 crore loan to a company `Bharani Beach Resorts' on the basis of security given by an NRI Susheela, who is a friend of Sasikala.Susheela, who was not so affluent, had received US $ 19,91,610 (then `3 crore) from abroad.
 
 From the company, Sasikala took `2.2 crore and used it to buy shares in Kodanad tea estate. All the transactions took place against the provisions of FERA. Regarding that, witnesses gave statements and adequate evidence was also available. But, the lower court judge failed to consider them. Hence, the orders discharging the accused needed to be set aside, the ED argued. After hearing the arguments, the judge had reserved his orders a few weeks ago. On Wednesday, the judge passed orders setting aside the orders of the economic offences court discharging Sasikala and Dinakaran from the cases and upholding the orders refusing to discharge her from the other three cases.
