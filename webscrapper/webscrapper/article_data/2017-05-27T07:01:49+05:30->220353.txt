The operator of Swastik theatre, Tindivanam, Prakash, who was caught in the illegal act, was arrested. Theatres use satellite-based digital cinema projection platforms like Qube and UFO for receiving and projecting films. The theatre owner is permitted to screen the film only during the slotted show timings. Swastik theatre operator Prakash was nabbed through the central server data which caught him projecting the film well past midnight when all the shows for the day were over. Police confiscated all digital equipment including the UFO projector from the theatre.
