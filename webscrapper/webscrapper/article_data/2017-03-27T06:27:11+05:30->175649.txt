 Sixteen years have passed, and today, the members of   ( ) have cleaned at least 270 temples in the city and   so far.
 
 The fourth Sunday of every month is used for cleaning temples in Chennai while the second Sunday of every month is used for cleaning temples in Kumbakonam.Why Kumbakonam? “It has a lot of abandoned and neglected temples,“ said B Sreenivasan, an IASSIM founder.
 
 IASSIM has 800 volunteers from various walks of life.There are doctors, engineers, software employees and daily workers in the group. There is no funding. How do they take care of the expenses? “If there is a marriage or birthday in the family of a group member, he sponsors food. For the rest, we manage on our own,“ Sreenivasan said .
 
 Cleaning old temples is not easy . But IASSIM's group of dedicated volunteers want to preserve our heritage thro ugh such temples. “We deci de on the temples to be clea ned at monthly meetings and information regarding this is sent to every member. We form a team based on their availability,“ said T   nan, another IASSIM mem ber.
