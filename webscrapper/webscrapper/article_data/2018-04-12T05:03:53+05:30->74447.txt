BHOPAL:   has given the clean chit to Arun Kumar Nimawat, a medical intern at   in Rajasthan, who was booked by Madhya Pradesh   as a 'middleman' in the Vyapam scam.

 It’s apparently the first time that CBI has removed a name from the list of accused in STF’s FIR. STF has even declared a Rs 5,000 bounty for his arrest.
 
 CBI’s note for not chargesheeting Nimawat says: “Sufficient evidence regarding his involvement in the case could not be found despite all efforts made during investigation. Hence, the allegations against him could not be substantiated. Therefore, the accused is not sent for trial and no action is proposed against him.”
 
 The case pertains to PMT 2012 scam in which STF filed an FIR on October 30, 2013, naming Nimawat and 10 others.
 
 Sources say STF put Nimawat’s name on record on the basis of the memorandum of Dr Sanjeev Kumar Shilpkar, who said he had given a list of 90 students to Vyapam’s chief system analyst Nitin Mohindra for “adjusting their seat” under the ‘Engine-Bogie’ scheme. The deal was Rs 1 lakh per candidate of which Rs 10 lakh was paid in advance to Mohindra, says Shilpkar’s memorandum with STF.
 
 According to Shilpkar, Nimawat brought six ‘engine’ students — those who would solve questions for the bogies — and was paid Rs 5 lakh in advance. It was after this statement that Nimawat was booked and an reward announced for his arrest.
