 Born on April 2, 1939 in Kaza village in Krishna district, Sulochana along with Arikepudi Kousalya Devi and Ranganayakamma heralded a new trend in Telugu literature.

Critics often say that she was the early reflection of feminism in Telugu mainstream literature.
 
 While she had distanced herself from active literature in the last couple of decades, Sulochana was the highest paid writer and earned royalties till her death.

 She had to her credit 100 novels, beginning with the famous 'Secretary' that was adapted as a film with late Akkineni Nageswara Rao (ANR) and Vanisri in the lead and was a commercial hit. The novel has seen 90 reprints though it was written 50 years ago. Its protagonist, Rajasekhar, occupies cult figure status in Telugu. Sulochana's last contribution for films was director Trivikram's Nithin and Samantha starrer ' A...Aa', which was partially inspired by her novel 'Meena'. 
 
 Several Telugu readers and writers took to social media to pay tributes to her. Condoling her death, vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu tweeted, "Saddened by the news of passing away of Telugu novelist Yaddanapudi Sulochana Rani."
