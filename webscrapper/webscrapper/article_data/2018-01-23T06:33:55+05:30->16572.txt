KOLKATA: A   allegedly molested a Bangladeshi passenger on the India-Bangladesh   soon after it started from the Kolkata terminal on Monday.

 The woman lodged a complaint with the station master of Gede, the last station on the Indian side, the train’s first stop after leaving Kolkata. Government Railway Police has taken up the matter and informed BSF and efforts are now on to identify the accused. “The company commander in charge of the contingent on duty on the train has gone to Gede to try and identify the jawan,” a senior BSF official of the South Bengal Frontier said.
 
 This is the first such case reported on Maitree Express, which started service on the Bengali New Year in 2014 and marked the restoration of an inter-border railway link that existed till the 1965 Indo-Pak war. Officials admitted that the incident was “embarrassing” for India.
 
 A senior GRP official said the woman had gone to the washroom and was returning to her seat when the jawan allegedly touched her inappropriately near the door and continued with his objectionable behaviour till she entered her coupe. “Her husband informed the TTE who asked him to lodge a written complaint. A case has been lodged under IPC Section 354 ( ) and we have initiated the process of identifying the accused. BSF has been cooperative,” the official said.
 
 A senior Eastern Railway official said: “We have taken up the matter very seriously and the accused will face punishment if found guilty. We have also informed the ministries of external and home affairs.” 
 
 Maitree Express passengers used to undergo immigration and customs checks at Gede and Darsana, the first station on the Bangladesh side, but end-to-end immigration and customs checks were introduced from November 2017 after an agreement to reduce running time of the train. BSF then took over security responsibilities from   (RPF) and GRP.
