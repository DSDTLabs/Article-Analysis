A couple of weeks after the civic body listed top 100 defaulters, it began cutting water connections to the properties of defaulters on daily basis.
 
 Official sources said that as many as 119 water connections, including 38 in   zone, 37 in   zone, 36 in  , and 8 in K Abishekapuram zone were disconnected by the corporation workers.
 
 “The disconnection of water lines at the properties of defaulters would be expedited in coming days,” a corporation official said. The civic body has urged locals to pay various taxes including property tax, water bill, vacant plot tax and other taxes at the zonal offices before March 31.
