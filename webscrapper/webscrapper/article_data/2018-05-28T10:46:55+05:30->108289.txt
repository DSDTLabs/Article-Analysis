PUNE: The   police foiled a highway robbery attempt in the early hours of Sunday with the arrest of two men. They recovered sharp weapons from the duo. 

 The police have identified the suspects as 22-year-old Ashok Makude of Chinchwadgaon and 21-year-old Yogesh Bathe of Khadakwasla. The duo was caught red handed while robbing Rs2,100 from  , the driver of a tempo parked along the   bypass.
 
 D N Nikam, sub-inspector of the Hinjewadi police, said that Shinde had on Saturday night parked his tempo near a petrol pump along the busy Katraj-Dehu Road bypass and was sleeping near it along with his son. 
 
 Around 12.15am, two men arrived on a scooter, woke Shinde up and abused him. "The duo threatened to kill Shinde with a sharp weapon and took Rs2,100 from his wallet," Nikam said.
 
 Around the same time, a patrolling team passed near the tempo in a police van. "After finding the duo's movements suspicious, the police stopped and asked them what they were doing there at that time," Nikam said, "When the duo started giving vague answers, the police took them into custody for questioning."
 
 Nikam said that when the police frisked them, they found sharp weapons and also the cash that had been robbed from Shinde. "The suspects have been arrested under section 392 of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Indian Arms Act," Nikam said.
 
 He said the police are probing whether the duo had robbed any other truck drivers on the bypass before.
