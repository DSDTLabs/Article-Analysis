Ahmedabad: A warehouse of   gutted in a major fire in Odhav early on Thursday morning. As per Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) officials, they received a call from a trader’s warehouse at 3.45 am after which 14 vehicles were employed in firefighting operation. The flames were doused after four-hour operation, said officials.

 “The incident had taken place behind Odhav fire station. While cause of fire could not be ascertained, it is suspected that a short-circuit might have started the flame. Almost all the stored goods were gutted in the incident,” said an official.
 
 AFES officials said that with rise in mercury, there has been a surge in fire incidents in the city and periphery. The AFES reports an average of eight incidents of fire for past one week. 
 
 Rajesh Bhatt, additional chief fire officer, AFES, said that due to heat, the insulation on bad quality wires wears off, exposing the metal wire and causing leak of the electric current. Another factor is overload on the supply lines due to higher usage of electronic equipments that combines internal and external heat and causes fire. On an average, AFES is reporting three to four short-circuit incidents since mid-March,” he said.
