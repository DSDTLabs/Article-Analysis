INDORE: A 40-year-old woman was found murdered on a pile of bricks near an under construction house in   on Thursday morning. 

 Kala Bai, a resident of Ratlam, who was living in city along with her husband   and son  , was found in front of her make-shift house with her head crushed. She worked as a guard at an under construction house. 
 
 Kala Bai’s son   told police that she usually woke up early every day. On Thursday, he was inside the house and was calling her. When she did not answer, he went outside and saw her lying on the bricks in a pool of blood. He checked her pulse but she had already succumbed to the injuries. 
 
 He immediately informed police. “A case has been registered and we are questioning family members about the crime. We are looking into all possible angles,” said  . 
 
 It also came to light that a retired inspector owns a house just five feet away from the crime spot. The area, where the murder took place, is very secluded and accused is said to have fled with the silver anklets that the woman was wearing. They, however, did not take gold mangalsutra and earrings, said police. 
 
 Amar Singh claimed that they had no enmity with anyone in the area and all of them were daily wage labourers. “There was no one who could harm my mother,” he said.
