A few years ago, director   briefly worked with composer MR   for the background score of his film Whistle. Their short encounter, though, impressed Prashant so much that he had been looking for an opportunity to collaborate with Charan again. That happened with  , his   and Kriti Kharbanda-starrer, which hits theatres this week.
“I have been a fan of Charan’s work, but I also had a plan in place for the music of Dalapathi. I have literally tortured him to get the sound of the film right. He must have composed at least 100 tunes to get to the the final six songs that are on the soundtrack. There were times when I okayed a tune and the lyrics over a span of a few hours and others, when we have worked on one tune for more than a month. That’s how particular I was about the music of the film,” explains Prashant.
 While the audio songs were released a while ago, the director is looking at putting only one video song in the public domain before the film’s release. 
 “The montage song,  , sung by Vijay Prakash and Sindhuri Vishal, featuring Prem, Kriti and Chikkanna, will be available today,” says Prashant.
