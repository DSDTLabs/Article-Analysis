TRICHY: With only one day left for the deadline to submit applications for admission to self-financing schools under the   Act in  , a whopping 3,650 applications have been received so far.

 More number of applications is expected on Friday. “This is perhaps the first year since 2013 when the applications received have been double the reserved seats,” the official said.
 
 There is a possibility of schools to implement the randomisation process since the number of applications is likely to be more than the available seats in each school. The   had to fill the seats in two phases last year as the number of applications received was less, unlike this year.
 
 While 25 per cent of seats in 116 self-financing schools are reserved under RTE this year, there are a total 1,796 seats to be filled in Trichy.
