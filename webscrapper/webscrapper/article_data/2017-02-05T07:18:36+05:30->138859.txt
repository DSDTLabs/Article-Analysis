HYDERABAD: The tussle between the   and   chairman   over the panel’s term has left several petitioners confused over the status of the body. 

 The issue came to the fore with the state government evicting the commission from its   office at  , maintaining the term of the panel, headed by Khan, has ended. An annoyed chairman knocked at door of the high court, praying that the panel be permitted to operate until its bifurcation. 
 
 One such petitioner, who identified herself as Tilat Ara, a former government employee, said that calls to the commission office remained unanswered. 
 
 She also pointed out that Khan too remained unresponsive to requests for taking up her petition. “It was only in January that I approached the commission informing it of my intention to file a petition against discrimination. I was told to come with a petition. However, two or three days later none of my calls and messages was being answered,” she said, adding that it was much later that she came to know of the controversy through media. Another petitioner from Mahbubnagar, who did not wish to be identified, shared a similar story. “When I went to the office, I was told to go to the new office. It took me a long time to find out where it was. And when I finally arrived, there was nobody to take my petition,” he said. 
 
 It was earlier reported in these columns that civil society members and socio-religious organisations cutting across faiths had gathered to protest the manner in which the minorities panel was ‘treated’.
