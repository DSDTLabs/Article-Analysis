The existing colour codes include black bags for disposal of kitchen and stationary waste, red bags for plastic items such as catheter, gloves and IV fluid bottles, yellow for anatomical waste such as swabs, biopsy or skin tissue, plaster, dressing pads, needles in puncture proof containers and other pathological waste. At KGH alone, daily around 20 kgs of yellow bag waste and approximately 15 kgs of red bag waste is generated.
 
 As per official figures, one to five tonnes of biomedical waste is generated daily from various hospitals in the city, which are brought to the five-acre disposal site at Kappuluppada in the city outskirts. Per hour, around 250 kgs of waste is incinerated at the five-tonne capacity plant, which has been leased out by the government to   (Andhra) Private Limited.
 
 “However, when it comes to collection of biomedical waste, services of Maridi is not regular. They come around five days a week to collect the waste. It’s warranted that they come daily to KGH,” added Umamaheswar.
