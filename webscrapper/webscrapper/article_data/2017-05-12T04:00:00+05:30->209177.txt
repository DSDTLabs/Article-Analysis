Vadodara: Lawyer of cash-for-marks scam accused and founder of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth Dr Mansukh Shah, on Thursday opposed special public prosecutor who had demanded that Shah’s bail plea be rejected.

 Shah’s lawyer B R Trivedi told the court that the citations of judgements of Supreme Court and various state high courts given by special public prosecutor Bharat Badami have no relevance with Shah’s case. Trivedi argued that the special public prosecutor had cited orders of offences like rape and murder, while Shah’s case was of corruption.
 
 Trivedi also presented the marksheets and other documents of a student who according to Badami was given admission in Sumandeep Vidyapeeth even though he had failed in his HSc exam.
 
 The court is expected to give order on the bail plea on May 15.
