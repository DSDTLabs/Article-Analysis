PUNE: A  , equipped to make around 3,000 to 5,000 meals per day, will be set up at   by the   and   Ltd (IRCTC) soon.

 An IRCTC official said under the new policy, all the kitchens managed by the railways will be transferred by the month end to the IRCTC.
 
 “The new catering policy was rolled out by the ministry last month. We have requested the Pune division authorities to provide us space in the station premises for the base kitchen. Once adequate space is provided, the kitchen will be set up with all facilities.,” the official told TOI.
 
 The base kitchen will provide meals to passengers when the train passes through that particular station.
 
 These kitchens are responsible for supplying meals on trains under the railways and on those managed by private contractors.“We thought that a base kitchen will be apt for Pune as setting up of a central kitchen requires a lot of space. Here, trains that pick up food for passengers from the food plaza or the pantry car contractors who have their kitchens. With many trains passing through stations in Pune division, the kitchen will be helpful for passengers,” the official pointed out.
 
 Amresh Kumar, a Hadapsar resident, who travelled by the   recently, said, “I think the food served in the train is from a private contractor. Although the meals taste okay, I am not so sure about the hygiene. The food items are overpriced and are charged differently to customers. I think the plan to set up a base kitchen in Pune is a good idea as it will be clean and the rates will be fixed.”
