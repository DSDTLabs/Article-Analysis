Pune: The Kondhwa police have registered an offence against a man (30) from Solapur for outraging the modesty of his 16-year-old   and uploading the her photographs on a social networking site.

 The suspect has been booked under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
 
 An officer from the Kondhwa police said the girl lodged the complaint with the police on Wednesday. “The complainant has told us that the incident occurred between 2016 and 2017 when the girl used to visit the suspect’s house in Solapur to meet her sister. The suspect used to outrage the modesty of the girl whenever they were alone in the house,” the officer said.
 
 In spite of the constant harassment, the girl kept quiet. “However, the girl found her photographs uploaded on a social networking site recently, accompanying some obscene comments. When she searched about the origin of the pictures, she found that her brother-in-law has uploaded the pictures. This is when the girl informed her parents and lodged the complaint,” the officer said.
 
 Meanwhile, the suspect’s wife on Thursday approached police and lodged a complaint stating that her husband and in-laws were demanding Rs 8 lakh from her for buying a luxury car. “We have registered an offence under section 498 (A) (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the IPC against the suspects,” the officer said.
