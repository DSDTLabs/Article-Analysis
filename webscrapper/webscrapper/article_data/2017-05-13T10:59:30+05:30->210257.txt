MUMBAI: The city’s first air-conditioned electrical multiple unit (EMU)   has been handed over to   (WR) for carrying out trials. It had undergone static and dynamic   on   (CR) since November 2016.

 The rake had arrived from the Integral Coach Factory (ICF), Chennai, in April 2016. CR had initially announced that it will run the train but it has a height of 4.335m, as against the maximum permissible height of 4.270m for EMU coaches. The lower height of British-era bridges between CST and Kurla also forced CR to abandon the plan.
 
 A senior WR official said, “The rake was transferred to us on Thursday for trials, which will take three to six months. We are positive about introducing the rake around Diwali.”
 
 It will be deployed only after the commissioner of railway (safety) clears it.
 
 Height could have been problem at Mahalaxmi and Mahim but WR rectified the problem by lowering tracks.
 
 Sources said that since only one   rake has been manufactured, it would not be possible to run more than 12 services a day on the fast and slow corridors. To begin with, it will run between Churchgate-Borivli and Churchgate-Andheri.
 
 During dynamic trials, the track worthiness of a new train, its dynamic behaviour in different conditions regarding safety, stability and quality rides are checked. Similarly, emergency brake distance trials are carried out to test braking potential.
 
 The dynamic trail on CR began almost year after the rake arrived as initially there was issue with the automatic door-opening system in one coach. Later, there was a problem with software, which was fixed by ICF, BHEL and Strukton (consultants) technicians.”
 
 The AC rake was manufactured under ‘Make In India’ and the technology was indigenously developed. BHEL provided its electrical system.
 
 It may have a fare system on the lines of the Delhi Metro. CR does not plan any concession for a season ticket for AC trains.
