VIJAYAWADA: A man and his woman partner have been arrested for   to the tune of lakhs of rupees on the pretext of granting loans without any collateral.

 The fraud came to light recently when one of the victim  , a resident of Vijayawada lodged a complaint with the police. The accused were identified as Patnam Surendra Baba (36) and Satri Anita alias Swathi Priya (27). The two accused were operating the loan racket in association with three others namely Chinna, Lokesh Reddy, Krishna Kumar and Satya Prasad.
 
 As per their modus operandi, the fraudsters used to advertise in local vernacular dailies offering people loans without any collateral. To carry out their plan successfully, they would even convince people that the loans would be arranged through the   (SFC) at an annual interest rate of 9.6% for loans against property.
 
  After seeing an advertisement in a local daily, the victim Naidu Ravi Varma had contacted   on his mobile phone, the latter assured Varma to arrange loan against property at a subsidised interest purportedly by SFC. Further, to win the trust of Varma, Surendra Babu cited a case where he could get Rs 20 lakh loan sanctioned with Rs 10 lakh subsidy. Believing the fraudster, Varma deposited Rs 45.50 lakh in two bank accounts on May 16 for a loan amount of Rs 2.8 crore.
 
 A few days after the transaction, Varma realised that he was deceived by the gang and lodged a complaint with the police. A cheating case has been filed against the accused in Machavaram police station and they would be produced in Vijayawada court. 
 
 After investigations, cops discovered that the gang had also defrauded two other persons- Danduvayi Venkataramana and   from Nellore - to the tune of Rs 4 lakh in a similar way.
