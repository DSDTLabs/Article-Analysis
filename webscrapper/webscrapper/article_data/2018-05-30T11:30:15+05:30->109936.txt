THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Political parties in Kerala have a new fad: find and publicise the political leanings of those involved in crime, despite the brutality of such acts. The alleged honour killing of  , too, saw a flurry of political activities. Such politics over the dead, however, doesn’t augur well for the state.

 
 “This is a dangerous trend as the brutality of the crime is being trivialised. The brutality is what ought to be seen, and not the politics,’’ said Prof J Prabash, political scientist.
 
 On Monday, the attempt was to find out the political leanings of the main suspects. The ‘game’ culminated in rival parties claiming their ‘right’ over the body on Tuesday. “I went there to ensure the presence of higher officials during the post mortem. But, they did not allow me into the mortuary,’’ said  , MLA, whose presence angered the CPM.
 
 Power minister M M   found the media to be sensationalising the police’s behaviour, especially during the   rule. “You should not threaten us. We have seen such several instances in the past,” he said. Mani’s cabinet colleague A K Balan, said Kevin’s was not the first honour killing in the state. “Several crimes new to Kerala are happening.
 
 Former chief minister   said the crime happened during the LDF governments’ second anniversary. “The police force is not in right direction,” he said in Kannur.
 
 Efforts to politicise crimes by highlighting the political leanings of those involved had happened in the cases of Edappal movie hall molestation and in the brutal murder of a law student at Perumbavoor in  .
 
 “Politicising crime lead to simplifying such acts. Even if it is done by any political party worker, the crime he did and the brutality is what that matters,” said Prof Prabhash.
