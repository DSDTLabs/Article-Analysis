MYSURU: The district has seen a spike in the number of people testing positive for   this year. Mysuru reported 27   positive cases and two related deaths in the first 50 days this year (January to February 20, 2017). The district reported just five H1N1 positive cases last year.

 The two who succumbed to swine flu were from Mysuru. On February 18, a 23-year-old pregnant woman from Kumbarkoppal, Reshma, died of the disease. Just two days later on February 20, 70-year-old Prabhakar from   succumbed to the deadly virus.
 
 The district health authorities sent 78 suspected H1N1 samples to Bengaluru’s NIMHANS this year till February 20, of which 27 tested positive. All the 27 are undergoing treatment and are stable.
 
 The sudden rise in swine flu cases this year has kept the district health officials on their toes. Mysuru DC D Randeep convened a meeting with the district health officials and doctors from private hospitals, where he asked them to take stock of the situation. During the meeting, district health officer Dr B Basavaraj and district surveillance officer Dr Kusuma briefed the DC about the measures taken. Availability of ventilators was also discussed. In Mysuru, apart from   which has 26 ventilators, no other government hospitals have ventilators.
 
 “The health department employees including those at taluk levels are conducting surveys to identify people with swine flu symptoms. House-to-house survey is on. Pamphlets making people aware about the disease are also being distributed. Those having cough, cold and fever should report to hospitals or nearby health centre for checkup,” said district health officer Dr Basavaraj.
 
 “The virus spreads when one touches an infected surface or breathe cough and sneeze droplets in the air. Young children, pregnant women and the elderly are more susceptible to develop complications. Those who test positive must take rest, keep themselves warm and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration,” added Dr Basavaraj.
