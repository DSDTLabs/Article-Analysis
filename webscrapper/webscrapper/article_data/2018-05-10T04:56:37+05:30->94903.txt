MUMBAI: More clashes are expected between BMC and hawkers over proposed hawking zones. After a long delay, the first town vending committee (TVC) meeting was held on Wednesday to draw up guidelines to relocate hawkers according to a new law, but it failed to form a consensus. The 20-member TVC, headed by civic chief Ajoy Mehta, comprises representatives of NGOs, experts, civic officials and eight members of hawker unions. 

 According to the new Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending Act, the BMC formed the TVC on a government directive. The rule states that the TVC must survey street vendors, issue them vending certificates and decide on their relocation. 
 
  Citizens are upset as most hawkers are illegal. The law is meant to regulate hawking and remove them from congested streets. The BMC conducted a survey to identify eligible hawkers and selected dedicated hawking zones where they will be relocated. It recently completed TVC formation formalities. 
 
 Hawker unions told Mehta they were not taken into confidence while planning hawking pitches, mandatory under law.
 
  Azad Hawkers' Union president Dayashankar Singh said, "The BMC called us only to sign the pitches' plan they had finalized. The law clearly states the TVC will decide it. They are allowing hawkers to continue on spots where they have been vending for 40 years but only at Matunga and Grant Road station. We have strong opposition to 10 of the 11 points on the agenda." 
 
 Civic officials asked hawker leaders to submit their proposal for examination. Deputy municipal commissioner Nidhi Chaudhary said they will examine the meeting discussions before issuing a public statement. The BMC had identified 89,900 pitches in 1,100 zones, where they plan to accommodate 99,435 hawkers.
