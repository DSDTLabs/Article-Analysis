MANALI: A tourist from Karnataka,  , who had come to visit Manali with her mother, had gone missing on January 14. She was traced by the police from Dharamshala as the girl is believed to have been influenced by Buddhism. The girl had left her family and changed her numbers thrice in a week.

 Her mother, Usha, rushed to Manali police station to lodge a missing complaint while her father Satish also reached Manali to search for her. The girl had left the hotel without telling her mother, withdrawn Rs 4,000 from ATM and switched her phone off.
