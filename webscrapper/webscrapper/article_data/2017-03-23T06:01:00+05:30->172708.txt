NAGPUR: Admissions under the   ( ) quota continued in Nagpur district well past the Monday deadline, leading to 52.62% seats now being filled. By Wednesday evening, total 3,602 admissions had been confirmed.

 Education officials said the process has not officially “restarted” yet but they are entertaining those parents who were unable to confirm admissions earlier.
 
 An official said, “Some parents had submitted half their documents and were in the process of getting other required things in order. We felt it was not fair to refuse admissions to parents for such a small issue.”
 
 The Nagpur education office has sought permission from their superiors in Pune to restart admissions in view of the poor response of converting applications into actual admissions.
 
 Bunty Shelke, corporator from ward no. 18, however, blames the education department for RTE’s poor conversion rate. Shelke said, “Parents from my ward have been complaining for a long time about the slow server which hampered online registrations and also unprofessional attitude of the people there. We are giving time till Thursday to district education officer Dipendra Lokhande to sort out things, after which there will be a major protest at his office.”
 
 The RTE admission problem got complicated because of confusion over address proof for those living on rent. NGO RTE Action Committee’s chairman Shahid Sharif had earlier pointed out to the department for the need to simplify and have practical solutions in place.
 
 Sharif said, “Majority of the applicants are poor and they don’t have registered rental agreements for their tenements. The department finally relaxed the rule and documents like Aadhaar card were being accepted as address proof but many schools were refusing to accept it. In fact, there were some who forced parents to submit affidavits confirming their residential address.”
