Nagpur: Granting a big relief to 11 Regional Transport Office (RTO) employees, the Nagpur bench of Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT) directed the state government to promote them with deemed date promotion set as September 5, 1980. The appellants argued that they were promoted from 1989 from junior to senior clerk, instead of 1980, despite being eligible and no adverse remarks on their records.

 A single-judge bench comprising vice-chairman JD Kulkarni quashed and set aside the recommendation of the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) and asked the government to give all monetary benefits of the promotion from junior to senior clerk from the effective date within four months.
 
 Madhav Nardodkar, Niranjan Kokardekar, Narayan Karemore and other appellants approached the tribunal after failing to get a satisfactory response from the government over promoting two RTO employees junior to them to senior clerk from September 5, 1980. Another female employee was given the same promotion after she raised her grievance.
 
 On June 26, 2009, the DPC found the petitioners were eligible for promotion to the post of senior clerk, effective from 1980. However, they were recommended for promotions July 31, 1989.
 
 Their counsel Tushar Mandlekar contended that there was no adverse remark on the appellants’ confidential reports and they are entitled for promotion as per Section 2 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules 1982 and Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
 
 He also argued that the promotion is the right of the employees and lapses by the state government by not conducting the DPC can’t be grounds for refusal. He stated that the rule of ‘equity and fairness’ guaranteed by the constitution is an essential feature in service jurisprudence. The right of eligible employees for promotion is their ‘fundamental right’ guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, he contended.
