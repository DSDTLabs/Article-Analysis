VIJAYAWADA: An elderly   was murdered by unknown people at   in Krishna district, on Friday night. The killers escaped with valuables and a Toyota Etios car. Police suspect the well-off couple might have been killed by persons known to them. 

 The victims,   (72) and his wife   (67), were found lying in a pool of blood by their maid in the bedroom of their house in Rajendra Nagar, on Saturday morning. The maid raised an alarm, and alerted family members and the police. 
 
 The couple had been staying alone in the house since their son, who is into real estate business, got married and settled in Hyderabad five years ago. Chowdary used to run a rice mill in Gudivada.
 
 The police said the killers did not touch a   belonging to the couple and made off with the Etios, presumably to escape attention. The couple’s driver, Sai Chowdary, is missing and his phone is not reachable. However, the police did not confirm his involvement in the crime. 
 
 The police found blood stains on the wall of the drawing room. They said it seems the victims put up a fight when the suspects attacked them. The couple is said to have been bludgeoned with a heavy object, before being stabbed to death. The suspects dragged one of the victims from the drawing room to the bedroom. A dog squad has been pressed into service.
 
 The couple is survived by their two daughters, besides the son. 
 
 Krishna district superintendent of police,  , said: “We have collected some crucial evidence. We will come to a conclusion very soon.”
