Veteran actress   said she did not define herself as a feminist until 'quite recently'. The 71-year-old   star says even though she always lived like a feminist, she was not a part of the movement.

  
  
 "I didn't define myself as a feminist until quite recently, but I had always lived like a feminist and believed in the obvious; that women were as capable and as energetic and as inspiring as men. But to join a movement called   seemed too didactic, too  . "
 
 "However, I have come to understand that feminism is not an abstract idea but a necessity if we - and really by 'we,' I mean you guys - are to move us forward and not backward into ignorance and fearful jealousy. Now, I am a declared feminist. And I would encourage you to be the same," Helen Mirren said.
