SURAT: A team from the state monitoring cell of police seized a container truck carrying Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) worth Rs 53 lakh near Valsad on National Highway 48 (old NH8) on Friday night. It was being brought from Punjab and entered Gujarat from Bhilad check-post. 

 Police recovered 900 boxes of IMFL worth Rs 53 lakh from the container. The container and truck worth Rs 22 lakh were also seized. Truck driver   of Nanded in Maharashtra was arrested and is being questioned. 
 
 “It seems that after strict action by police against bootleggers operating in south Gujarat and Daman they are trying other ways to smuggle liquor. It is surprising that the container comi-ng from Punjab entered the state from the south and travelled almost double the distance,” said a police officer. The driver wasn’t aware about the location to deliver the consignment. He was to receive a call on reaching Surat.
