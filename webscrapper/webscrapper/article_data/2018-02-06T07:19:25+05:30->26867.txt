AHMEDABAD:   has prompted the LDF government in Kerala to junk its ambitious deal to breed  's famed Gir cows in God's own country.

 A delegation led by K Raju, Kerala minister for animal husbandry, had in September met his the then counterpart Babu Bokhiria seeking 200 Gir cows to rear the breed, known for its high milk yield, with a view to enhance milk production and boost the dairy sector. Fearing attacks by self-styled cow vigilantes, Raju had also sought assurance of a safe passage through Gujarat and Maharashtra.
 
 Four months down the line, Kerala has developed cold feet and cancelled the deal. Confirming the development, Raju told TOI, “Considering the current situation where incidents of violence by gau-rakshaks are rampant, we have preferred not to sign the deal to bring Gir cows to Kerala fearing attacks during transit.”
 
 “We are evaluating a possibility of transporting Gir cows from Gujarat to Kerala by rail. We may approach Gujarat government afresh with a new proposal if it is possible to ferry cattle by train two three months later,” Raju added. Minister of state for animal husbandry and cow-breeding Bachu Khabad said he does not immediately have details of the deal with Kerala.
 
 The Gir cow breed is indigenous to the Gir forest and surrounding regions in Saurashtra and is known for its high milk yield. Ironically, while the Gir cow's transportation to Kerala was junked due to absence of safe passage, the breed is the toast of white revolution in South American country Brazil which has around 50 lakh heads of this unique breed.
