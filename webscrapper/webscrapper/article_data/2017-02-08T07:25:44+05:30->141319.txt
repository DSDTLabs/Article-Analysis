PUNE: The   have   for   to the tune of Rs 11.80 lakh. The case pertains to a piece of land in Dapoli which the developers had promised to sell him, but failed to do so even after taking money from him. Gaurav Pramod Akolkar (36), a resident of NIBM Road in Kondhwa, lodged a complaint against the developers in the city as the deal was finalised at the firmâ€™s   office in Deccan area.

 The police said the land developers had placed an advertisement in the newspaper stating that they were selling bungalow plots at a picturesque location in Dapoli in Ratnagiri district.
 
 Akolkar had returned home on leave when he noticed the advertisement. He, then, contacted the developers and paid an advance amount. Subsequently, he visited the site in Dapoli and liked the area.
 
 Later, Akolkar paid the developers a total of Rs 11.80 lakh through cash and cheques. The firm and Akolkar even signed an agreement and paid the registration fees.
 
 In the meantime, the partnership among the five land developers fell apart over some financial dispute after which all of them started ignoring Akolkar.
 
 Despite repeated requests by Akolkar to hand over the land documents and to complete other formalities, the firm did nothing, police said.
 
 After following up the matter for three years, and realising that nothing was happening, Akolkar decided to approach the police and lodge a complaint against the developers.
 
 Assistant inspector   of Deccan police station told TOI that the developers, despite their difference, should have given the possession of the land to Akolkar as he has paid the full amount towards the plot.
