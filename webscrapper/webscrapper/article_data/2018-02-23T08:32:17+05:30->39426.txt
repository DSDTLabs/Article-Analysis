CHENNAI: Consumers won't be able to pay electricity bills at   counters on the fourth Saturday of every month as the management has decided to make it holiday for   employees. It will come into effect from February 24. To compensate the loss of working hours, employees will be working an additional 15 minutes in the evenings of all working days. Power minister P Thangamani announced this while signing the pay agreement with employees' unions at the TNEB headquarters here on Friday. 

 "We have decided to have an additional holiday on fourth Saturday of every month as the money collected from consumers could not be deposited in banks, which remain closed on fourth Saturday," said a senior   official. The management has also decided to give an additional increment to all employees as TNEB is completing 60 years since its inception.
 
 As TOI reported, the management has given 2.57 fitment factor for employees. The minimum hike in salary for workers will be 3,175 and the maximum 7,775 per month. For the officials, the minimum hike will be 5,800 and maximum 27,375 per month.
