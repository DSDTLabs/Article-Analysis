HASSAN: Notwithstanding the intentions of the central government, we will come out with a loan-waiver scheme within 24 hours if our party is voted to power, said JD(S) state president and former chief minister HD Kumarswamy at a Vikasaparva rally in Hassan on Thursday.

 “I don’t know what the central government will do. But we will ensure a loan-waiver scheme in 24 hours after the announcement of election results. An Indian Institute of Technology will be set up in the city even if the Centre declines to sanction one,” he said.
 
 Stating that he had learnt the nous and art of administering the state from his father, former Prime Minister  , Kumaraswamy added, “I will ensure all-round development of the district.”
 
 Kumaraswamy said that he was keenly aware of the plight of farmers in the district. “Instead of cultivating potatoes for customers in Bengaluru, we should grow vegetables that can be sent abroad. We should look to earn Rs 150, with an investment of just Rs 100. The plan I have for the district is unique and special. JD(S) wants to win all the assembly constituencies in Hassan,” he added.
 
 The former CM said that he would try to implement scientific agricultural practices used in Israel. “I will get 200 scientists from Israel. If the party is voted to power, all senior citizens will be given a monthly pension of Rs 5,000, and pregnant women will be paid Rs 36,000. All government schools will be brought on a par with private schools. I will ensure free quality education for all,” he said.
 
 Criticising CM  , Kumaraswamy said, “The   government is running the state on loans borrowed from various agencies. Liquor that costs Rs 15, is being sold for rs 70 or Rs 80. This is how state government is ruining families.”
 
 Attacking demonetisation and the   (GST), he said, “They have caused a lot of heartburn even for industrialists. Vote JD(S) to power. I have a comprehensive plan for all sectors.”
