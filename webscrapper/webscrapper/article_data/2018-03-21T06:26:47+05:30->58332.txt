Harjit Masih, 27, wonders why the Centre did not believe his account that 39 of his compatriots had been killed within days of their abduction in 2014. The “lone survivor” also questioned the government’s motive for subjecting him to alleged interrogation and detention after his return to India. Masih, who now works in the   grain market as a labourer, said on Tuesday. “I have been telling the truth all this time. I was jailed for six months. Who will compensate for that? The government should have trusted me.” Masih, who worked as a pipe fitter in a construction firm in  , had been among 40 Indians and 51 Bangladeshis abducted in Mosul. The IS terrorists detained the Indians in  , but allowed the Bangladeshis to leave. They shot the Indians, but   played dead and lived to tell his tale.
