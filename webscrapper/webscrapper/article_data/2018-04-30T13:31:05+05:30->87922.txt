 In his address, Trivedi said, "I have no hesitation in saying that B R Ambedkar was a Brahmin. There is nothing wrong with calling a learned person a Brahmin. In that context, I will say that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also a Brahmin."
 
 However,   leaders have strongly objected to Trivedi’s statement on social and in mainstream media.
 
 The Father of Indian Constitution, B R Ambedkar, was born into a Dalit family and grew up to be the torch bearer for the community's cause.
 
 Trivedi when contacted, “I request all to listen my speech on youtube who object to my statement regarding   and PM Modi of calling them Brahmin. I said all the Gyani (Knowledgeable person) man is Brahmin. In Bhagwad Gita’s fourth chapter’s 13th Rucha(sentence) Lord Krishna defined the Varna. He defined Gynati(caste) by the person’s Guna(qualities) not by Varna(profession). As we say that a person with high intellect became scientist, doctor or engineer likewise a person is called Brahmin irrespective of Varna of his birth. Subhaschandra Bose said that every brilliant person is a Brahmin. He never said that all those who are born in Brahmin family are Brahmin. I request all not to misquote me and listen what I said. I have very high regards for Baba Saheb Ambedkar and PM Modi."
