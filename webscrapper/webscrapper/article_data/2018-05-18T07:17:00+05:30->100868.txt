GHAZIABAD: An important factor behind Ghaziabad’s much-improved performance in Swachh Survekshan 2018 is the number of public   that the corporation managed to build, GMC officials said on Thursday.

 
 The GMC declared the municipal area open defecation-free ( ) last October. It also built 142 more lavatory seats more than the target fixed by the Swachh Bharat Mission, officials said. 
 
 A visit to several community toilets in the city on Thursday revealed that most of these are overcrowded and frequent fights erupt over who gets to use them first. Most of the toilets are in poor condition because of poor maintenance. Standing outside a community toilet located next to Indirapuram police station for over 30 minutes since 4am, with at least 20 persons queued ahead of him, Jeetan, (25), who migrated to   from Saharsa district in Bihar, said: “GMC staff come with sticks and threaten to thrash people defecating in the open. They also threaten us of fines and a jail term. It’s better to stand in the queue than to get into trouble.”
 
 The community toilet used by Jeetan and residents of a nearby shanty has one seat for men and two for women. Its users, mostly construction workers, start gathering here from 3.30am. GMC commissioner CP Singh said, “As of now, we have won just the first stage of the battle, ensuring that people do not defecate in open. The department is in the process of finalising a revenue model for the NGOs so that community toilets become self-sustainable.”
 
 In many slums, to avoid standing at community toilets, people have built makeshift toilets near their homes by digging six-foot-deep trenches and installing toilet seats on top.   (45), a vegetable seller in  , said, “It requires only Rs 1,500 to build this toilet. The municipal staff know about it, so they do not come here.”
