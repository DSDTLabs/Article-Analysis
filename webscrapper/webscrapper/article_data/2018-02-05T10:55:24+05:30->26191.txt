THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader   has flayed   leaders for using their influence to make money for their family. CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury’s statement that party leaders should stay away from misusing their position for personal gains shows the plight of the party, he added.

 “Yechury had to make such a statement against the backdrop of allegations that Binoy Kodiyeri had cheated a Dubaibased company. This shows the deep degeneration within the party,” said Chennithala, adding that CPM general secretary had to issue such a warning as he was well aware that leaders and their families in   were becoming rich under the party banner.
 
 “It is most unfortunate that despite severe allegations, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan is maintaining silence,” said Chennithala. He must take a clear stand and reveal whether he endorses this cheating by family members of CPM leaders. Even after the chief minister was told to conduct an inquiry against Binoy, he was yet to respond to the demand, added the opposition leader.
 
 Now the need for an investigation had gained momentum since Yechury too had admitted the fact that the party leaders and their family were engaged in making money, he pointed out.
