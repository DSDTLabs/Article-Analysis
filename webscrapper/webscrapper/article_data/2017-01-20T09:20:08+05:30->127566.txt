INDORE: After failing to control power pilferage in the city's North division, authorities of Madhya Pradesh  . (MPPKVVCL) have now decided to replace overhead supply cables with insulated ones to prevent people from tapping into the main lines. 

 Officials said there are around 400 domestic consumers in areas like Pancham Ke Phel and   areas under the division. "We found over 40 percent of consumers were drawing power illegally," said  , superintendent engineer, MPPKVVCL.
 
 "Our enforcement teams found power tapping is rampant in these areas," he said. He added that 40-50 illegal connections were spotted and violators were booked.
 
 "People are not ready to cooperate with us, so we have decided to replace overhead supply lines with 25 to 35 square mm insulated supply lines," he added.
 
 Authorities had been making efforts to set up a 33 KV grid station in   area for a long time. The project is in limbo, due to opposition from locals. They have approached the district administration and police seeking protection for company staff to carry out work.
