Assamese designer   presented her collection Mekhela Chador on the second day of Lakme Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2017. The collection is inspired by Goddess Durga, traditional motifs like   (royal motif of two lions facing each other), Kolki (the paisley motif), Moourah which is the peacock and the butterfly motif.

 The models walked the ramp in hand-woven saris, Lehenga/cholis with exquisite flower motifs, all with a traditional touch. And for the traditional Assamese collection,   turned out to be the perfect muse for the designer. It seemed like she went back in time, as she was looking stunning as ever!
 
 And it has been quite some time since we have seen Preity in this avatar. She took to   and posted a video to express her thoughts and all the fears she had before walking the show: 
  
 The traditional Assamese MEKHELA CHADOR outfit is a two-piece garment- ‘Mekhela’ is the lower garment and the ‘Chador’ is the upper garment. The Mekhela is pleated just like a sari, but the pleats are on the right side. And the chador works like a dupatta, which is draped after the Mekhela is worn.
