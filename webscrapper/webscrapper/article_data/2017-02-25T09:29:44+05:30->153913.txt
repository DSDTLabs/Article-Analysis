CHENNAI: In an attempt to reduce fake votes, verify authenticity of voters and make  , students from Veltech Dr RR and Dr   are developing a wireless electronic voting machine.

 The machine, which can run on wireless local area network like Wi-Fi or with a bluetooth module, is being developed by final year UG students   from the Department of Computer Science & Engineering and P Shivapriya from Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering. Anot her different aspect to the machine is that it will be operated with the use of Aadhaar cards of voters. A bar code scanner in the machine will help facilitate the voter to just place the Aadhaar card under the scanner so the bar code is read and the UIDAI number is authenticated. “While voter ID cards have been manipulated in the past, this system will prevent any fraudulent voters,“ said Ganesh. Other than the bar codes, iris and finger impressions are also scanned and used for verification purposes.The students are also planning to approach government officials to explain their project and gain approval so the centralised Aadhaar system for the state can be connected to the machine server.
 
 The machine uses a program microcontroller with STM32 chips and makes use of Raspberry Pi (a card-sized single board computer) for central server access. The server will contain voters'data like Aadhaar card bar codes, pattern data of the iris, and finger impressions, which can be instantly transferred by means of WLAN (wireless) connectivity at every count of the vote.
 
 While the machine aims to have an edge over the current wired systems, availability of wireless network at all polling booths may be a hurdle. Acknowledging this, the team said they are also testing the Bluetooth module, so the booths need not depend on Wi-Fi alone.
