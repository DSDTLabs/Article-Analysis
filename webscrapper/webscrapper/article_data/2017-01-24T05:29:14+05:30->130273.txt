DARJEELING: Chief minister   on Monday said the state would develop the house at Giddepahar in  , where Netaji   lived briefly during the  , into a tourism spot.

 In 1936, the freedom fighter was put under house arrest by the British and he stayed in the Giddepahar house owned by his brother Sarat Chandra Bose. The house was brought by Sarat Chandra in 1922 and was witness to important incidents associated with the lives and struggles of both the Bose brothers.
 
 “We want Giddepahar to be developed as a tourism spot. On his birth anniversary today, I am giving Rs 10 lakh for development from the tourism department. And I will consider what else can be one,” Mamata said during a programme in Chowrastha to commemorate Netaji’s 121st birth anniversary.
 
 “After our government came to power, we organized the first programme as a state function in Kolkata. Since the past three years, we have been celebrating the event in Darjeeling which is also synonymous with Netaji. Bengal cannot be a state without the Hills that’s why we organize Netaji’s birth anniversary event in Darjeeling,” she said.
 
 The chief minister also raked up Bose’s mysterious disappearance issue and said the Centre should do more to shed light. “We are celebrating his (Bose’s) 121 birth anniversary and even after so many years we don’t know how, where and when Netaji died. He is a victim of circumstances. It is a sad tragedy,” she said. “Like the date of birth it’s equally important for us to know the date of his death,” she added.
