GURUGRAM: A demolition drive carried out by the forest department on Saturday and Sunday razed six illegal constructions in   and   areas of Gurugram .

 While a warehouse and a dhaba were razed in Haiderpur, some illegal constructions by four farmhouses in Damdama village were demolished by the department. The warehouse was used by construction companies to keep their equipments used in construction.
 
 A team, comprising a duty magistrate, 15 forest department officials from Gurugram and Sohna range and nearly 30 cops, were engaged in the encroachment drive that took place on the protected land.
 
 According to the officials from forest department, the construction was a violation of Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA), 1900 in the  . “It was PLPA and Aravali plantation land. Any kind of construction work on this land is an attempt to encroach the protected land and therefore an offence. We received complaints from a few local people, so we immediately took action. We appointed the duty magistrate and took along the cops,” said Deepak Nanda, district forest officer (DFO), Gurugram.
 
 Green activists alleged that lack of vigilance in the Aravalis area leads to encroachment and demanded that the number of trees cut before encroachment should be planted again. “Due to lack of vigilance in the Aravalis, it has become extremely difficult to keep a check over encroachment and other illegal activities going on in the Aravalis. There are a few locals who take advantage of it and encroach upon the green area. While the illegal structures are demolished, one of the major problem is that number of trees that are generally cut before encroaching upon the land, are never planted again. It is important to analyse the damage caused on the encroached land and plant the trees,” said Jitender Bhadana from Save Aravallis, a Faridabad-based environment NGO.
