Bengaluru: Two brothers were electrocuted in their coconut farm at Dasenahalli village near Hesaraghatta on the outskirts of Bengaluru on Sunday afternoon when an overhead electrical wire snapped and fell on them.

 The incident led to massive protest by villagers near Bescom office in Hesaraghatta till late night.
 
 Soladevanahalli police said Muniraju H, 21, and Ravi Kumar H, 18, both residents of Dasenahalli and sons of farmer Hanumanthaiah, were cutting grass in the farm. Around 2.30pm, a frond from one of the coconut palms fell on the electrical wires passing through the farm. The wire snapped and Kumar came in contact with it even as his brother rushed to save him. The duo died instantly. Passersby alerted police. 
 
 Villagers, who gathered in front of Bescom office, alleged that the negligence of the utility had resulted in the tragedy and sought action against the officials concerned.
 
 The demonstrators took the bodies to the protest venue and prevented police from shifting them for postmortem. They blocked the Madhure-Hesaraghatta Road for a few hours. Soladevanahalli police have registered a case against Bescom officials under Section 304a of IPC.
 
 “We are aware of the incident, but it is too early to say what exactly happened. A team has reached the spot to get more clarity on the cause of the mishap. The area had received rain continuously for seven days and this could be one of the reasons. Once we receive the ground report, we can take further action,” said P Rajendra Cholan, Bescom MD.
