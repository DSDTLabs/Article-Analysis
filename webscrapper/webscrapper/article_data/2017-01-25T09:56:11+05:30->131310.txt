THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   is planning to avoid run-ins with pro-prohibition groups and salvage the dignity of tipplers by opening more premium outlets.

  MD H Venkatesh told TOI that the corporation, while relocating shops, is trying to convert them into premium model self-service outlets, wherever possible. “We are doing this so that we can avoid long queues outside the outlets and ensuing traffic problems,“ said Venkatesh.
 
 In order to adhere with the   directive and stipulations in the Abkari Act, the corporation officials are also trying to locate buildings that are at least 2,000 square feet in expanse.
 
 If all goes well, the Bevco outlet in Tripunithura in Ernakulam could be converted into a premium outlet soon.
 
 Venkatesh said while many local bodies were against opening of new out lets in areas administered by them, there are some who have come forward offering space. They include local body authorities in Anchal, Neeleswaram, Ochira and Eerattupetta.
 
 “If it works out, it would be a win-win situation for all and beneficial for them in long term,“ Venkatesh said.
 
 Meanwhile, the MD has also written to the heads of all departments concerned, including police seeking their wholehearted support in dealing the crisis effectively.
