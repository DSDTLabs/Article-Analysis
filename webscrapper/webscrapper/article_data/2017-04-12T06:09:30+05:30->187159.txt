PATNA: Patna Petroleum Dealers’ Association ( ) president Brijendra Kumar Sinha on Tuesday threatened to give a call for indefinite strike if the state government failed to provide security to fuel outlets in the district.
 
  A unit of  , the PPDA observed a 12-hour strike during which petrol outlets remained closed from 6am to 6pm on Tuesday in protest against spurt in incidents of loot and vandalism at petrol pumps in the district.
  
  As all the 157 fuel outlets were shut, many vehicle owners in the district faced a harrowing time. Company-owned outlets were open, but only till 9am as the agitating PPDA members later forced them to down their shutters.
  
  The PPDA earlier observed 15-minute and 30-minute symbolic blackouts on March 23 and March 28 to press for police action against crime and criminals.
  
  “Neither the district administration nor the state government called the association for talks, our agitation notwithstanding. They do not seem to be bothered about either our security concerns or the hardship caused to general people because of our strike,” the association president regretted, adding at least nine incidents of loot took place at eight petrol pumps in Patna during the last six months with Fatuha’s   petrol pump being looted twice in three months.
  
  Sinha said the government must create a conducive atmosphere for petrol pump owners to conduct their business. “Police should act to create fear in the minds of criminals,” he said and added if the government remained unmoved even after the strike on Tuesday, the association at its meeting on Sunday might consider going on indefinite strike.
  
  Meanwhile, association member Anuj Raj said fuel outlet owners suffered losses worth at least Rs 5.4 crore due to the 12- hour strike. “The fuel outlets in Patna district sell approximately nine lakh litre of fuel in 12 hours from morning,” he said.
