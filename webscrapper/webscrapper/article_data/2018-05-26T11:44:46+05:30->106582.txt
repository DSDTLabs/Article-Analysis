If   & Johnson (J&J) won’t put a warning on its baby powder that it may be tainted with asbestos, some jurors were ready to do it for them.

 
 A California jury weighing J&J’s punishment over its handling of its iconic baby powder asked a judge if they could force the company to warn consumers that its Johnson’s Baby Powder could be contaminated with asbestos.
 
 
 After the judge said no, the jury awarded $4 million in punitive damages on Thursday to  , a 68-year-old woman who claimed her deadly cancer was caused by asbestos in J&J’s baby powder. A day earlier, the jury had awarded $21.7 million to  , finding J&J 67% responsible for her mesothelioma.
 
 J&J has steadfastly maintained that its baby powder has never contained asbestos and rejected calls to put a warning on its white bottles known the world over. J&J plans to appeal the verdict.
