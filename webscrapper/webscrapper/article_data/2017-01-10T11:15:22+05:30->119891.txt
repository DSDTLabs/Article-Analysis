PANAJI: Maharashtrawadi   (MGP) chief ministerial candidate   alias Sudin, on Monday, said he would retire from active politics before he turns 70. Speaking to reporters, Dhavalikar said that if MGP comes to power, then he will present a young cabinet to the state. “I will retire from active politics before I turn 70. At present I am 60 years old, and my work is coming to an end,” he said. 

 Stressing on the need for young faces in governance, Dhavalikar said he was almost certain that Congress had candidates who were septuagenarians. “People of Goa should think whether they want to continue with these people in Goan politics,” he added
 
 Dhavalikar said there are a lot of expectations from the citizens of Goa and that the state needs young blood to handle these demands. “We have finalized around 22 candidates and it will be officially announced in the next two days,” Dhavalikar said, adding that except for four senior leaders, rest of the party’s candidates are between the age group of 35 to 50 years.
 
 He claimed that twice in the past, he has received offers from the Congress and   (BJP) to merge the MGP with their respective parties and in return, become the chief minister. “I have opposed the merging and resisted the temptaton of becoming chief minister,” Dhavalikar said, stating that defence minister   offered him the merger and the chief ministerial post, when he was moving to Delhi.
