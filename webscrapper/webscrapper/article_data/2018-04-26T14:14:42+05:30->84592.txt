NAGPUR: With hung house predicted in  , BJP president Amit   on Wednesday afternoon held a discussion for over four hours with top brass of   (RSS). Shah reached the city by a special flight at 11.45am from Delhi and returned at 4.30pm. He spent the entire time in Sangh headquarters.

 Shah was accompanied by Krishna Gopal, sarkaryavah of RSS, from Delhi. The two held talks with RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat and the second sarkaryavah Bhaiyaji Joshi.
 
 Sources in RSS said that grassroot level feedback from Karnataka has worried the BJP leaders. “It seems unlikely that BJP will get 113 seats needed for forming a government in the state. This means negotiating with Janata Dal (Secular) for government formation. JD(S) in spite of getting less than half seats of BJP is likely to demand chief minister’s office for 2.5 years,” said a source. Polls in the southern state will be held on May 12 and the results will be declared on May 15. The state is very important for BJP as it is the only one in south India where BJP has a strong base.
 
 The source further said that Shah told Bhagwat, Joshi and Gopal that forming a coalition government with JD (S) meant diluting hardline Hindutva agenda. Some BJP leaders have been openly trying to polarize the electorate with one MLA saying that the election was a battle between Hindus and Muslims.
 
 Most BJP leaders from the city were out of station and did not go to the airport to receive Shah. Virendra Kukreja, standing committee chairman of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), was the only prominent face. Mayor Nanda Jichkar was late in reaching the airport.
