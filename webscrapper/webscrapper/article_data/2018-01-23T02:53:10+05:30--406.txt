LUCKNOW:   chief Akhilesh Singh will contest the 2019   elections from   Lok Sabha seat. The former CM said party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, who currently represents Azamgarh constituency, will contest the next election from Mainpuri. 

 The announcement came four months after the SP chief — amid a raging debate over nepotism in politics — publicly declared during an interaction with the media in   in September that his wife,  , who is the sitting MP from Kannauj, would not contest elections any longer. 
 
 “I would like to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Kannauj because it has been the parliamentary constituency of Lohiaji (Ram Manohar Lohia). The party will take the final call on this,” Akhilesh said.
