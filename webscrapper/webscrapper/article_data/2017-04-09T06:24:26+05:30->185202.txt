HYDERABAD: The sanitation workers' strike at   was called off on Saturday afternoon, after a fresh round of negotiations between hospital authorities and agitating workers. 

 But the truce failed to spare patients and their attendants of the horror of wading their way through heaps of filth and dirt.
 
 The deplorable hygienic condition at the hospital - prevalent for most part of the day - led to such distress among patients that one among them, still recuperating from a head injury, ended up cleaning the OP ward herself to get rid of the unbearable stench. 
 
 Sona Bai from   who has been staying at the hospital for the last five days was seen sweeping the floor on Saturday. When asked about it she said, "There is so much dirt that it has become impossible to sit around. Forget sitting, patients are unable to even breathe freely."
 
 With earlier efforts of the authorities to broker peace with the agitating workers failing, the entire sanitation work at the hospital had come to a standstill leaving wash rooms and common areas stinking. In fact even the ICUs, visitors complained, were raising an unbearable stench before the workers decided to call off the strike.
 
 With 250 sanitation contract workers on protest, the job of maintaining the 'health' of the hospital was left to the 150 permanent staff over the last three days. The situation worsened on Saturday morning as the agitating sanitation workers refused to allow anybody use their 'equipment', including dustbins and mops.
 
 Cleaning work resumed only around 4 pm. "We agreed to call off the strike after the Director for   (DME) assured us that we will get salaries on Monday, as per the latest salary structure. Workers have got down to the job of cleaning the hospital now. It will take about 10 hours for them to clear up the mess," said M Narasimha, president, Gandhi Hospital Contract Workers' Union.
