AHMEDABAD: With   increasing in number and cases of   shooting up by almost 50% after demonetization, the city crime branch has sent a proposal to the state home department for setting up an independent cyber   in the city.

 Currently all complaints regarding cyber-crimes are registered with the city crime branch and then forwarded for investigation to the cyber cell. “If the proposal is sanctioned then the cyber cell will have its own station diary to register FIRs,” said Deepan Bhadran, DCP, crime branch.
 
 “Complainants as well as police personnel have to run to and from the cyber cell office at Shahibaug and the city crime branch office at Gaekwad Haveli in the   for approvals, processes, and lodging an FIR,” said a senior crime branch official, adding, “A separate police station for cyber-crime will streamline processes.”
 
 Crime branch sources said they have demanded one ACP-level officer, four police inspectors, 10 police sub-inspectors, and a total staff of about 100. ‘We are hopeful of getting the proposal sanctioned in public interest,” said a senior official.
 
 Crime branch officials said that at present cyber cell officials are probing more than 400 applications regarding cyber-crime and online frauds. “We have only two inspectors in the cyber-cell dealing with such a huge workload,” added an official. Of the four inspectors, the crime branch proposed, three will conduct investigations and one will be dedicated to surveillance. Senior crime branch officials said according to SOP (standard operating procedure) the complainant at present has to mail his complaint by registered post. “Offence is registered only after scrutiny of the complaint. If a separate police station is sanctioned they can register their complaints without delay,” a crime branch official said.
