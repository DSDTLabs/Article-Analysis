NEW DELHI: The Delhi   refused to grant relief to   in connection with use of one of the stands â€“ RP Mehra Stand (old clubhouse) at the stadium whose structural stability is under a cloud.

 
 The DDCA in an urgent plea had sought permission from court to use the old clubhouse building only for media and broadcast purposes and not for spectators. But HC refused any interim relief and issued notice in connection with the RP Mehra block to the petitioner N C Bakshi. It posted the case for hearing for April 18 which was the prescheduled date of next hearing.
 
 Bakshi, through advocate   had moved HC in 2016 alleging that DDCA has no certificate of structural stability with respect to R P Mehra block as per the extant municipal byelaws.
 
 HC had earlier this month given DDCA time to place on record the structural stability certificate vis-a-vis R.P. Mehra Block. It had also directed an assessment of structural stability of the block and asked DDCA to give its report to SDMC which will then independently assess the structural stability of the block and also examine all other aspects.
