MUMBAI: Slamming the NDA government for its policies, MNS president   on Sunday said PM   was following in Adolf Hitler’s footsteps and his government was a fake one. Thackeray also appealed to all political parties to unite against   in the Lok Sabha elections to create a ‘Modi-mukt Bharat’ (Modi-free India) and alleged that there’s a conspiracy to create religious tension before the general elections.

 Addressing a party rally at Shivaji Park, Thackeray announced that MNS will hold its annual rally on the Dadar ground every Gudi Padwa. During his 80-minute speech, Thackeray referred to Modi as   and accused him of following the German dictator’s policies. “Modi is trying to control the media, judiciary, ED and  . No one can write against his government...he is using the same technique as Hitler... either threaten them or finish them,” he alleged.
 
 Coming down heavily on Modi and BJP president Amit Shah, Thackeray appealed to Hindus and Muslims to maintain harmony as the Ram Mandir issue could be raised before the polls. “Talks are on with a few Muslim organisations to raise the issue when the Ram Mandir matter goes forward in the SC. I am not against the Ram Mandir, but it should be built post elections,” he said.
 
 Thackeray alleged that Modi had signed an agreement to buy aircraft worth Rs 550 crore for Rs 1,600 crore. “Anil Ambani was with Modi while signing the agreement to buy the aircraft from France. Maharashtra doesn’t need Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train, nor does the Gujarati community. Maharashtra also does not want the Rs 22,000 crore Mumbai-Vadodara highway. Modi is nursing an old wound that Mumbai could not be part of Gujarat even after Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel put pressure on then PM Jawaharlal Nehru. So, this is his plan to end the identity of Mumbai.” He also slammed CM Devendra Fadnavis and finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar for being a part of a song on saving rivers.
