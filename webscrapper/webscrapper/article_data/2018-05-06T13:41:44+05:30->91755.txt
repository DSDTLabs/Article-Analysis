MADURAI: Unreserved tickets were generated through UTS (Unreserved Ticketing System) and also through the Automatic Ticket Vending Machine ( ) and Coin Operated Ticket Vending Machines (CoTVM) at the Madurai railway junction on Saturday.

 There was a big queue in front of the unreserved ticket counter as well as the single automatic ticket vending machine at the Western Entrance of the Madurai station, and people were happy to see that the tickets were trilingual in English, Hindi and Tamil. With the introduction of this facility, local unreserved tickets will have the names of the originating and destination stations in three languages.
 
 There were long queues at the ticket counter for the Madurai–Sengottah passenger on Saturday evening. When the train arrived there was a lot of scrambling and passengers tried to vie each other for tickets as well as securing seats.
 
 Rajaraman, a passenger, said that it would be better if one more vending machine was installed at the western entrance as it would help the crowds to move faster. “There are only two counters and one is for the reservation section, but there are many who try to catch the passenger trains, as it is cheaper than buses,’’ he said.
 
  of  , said that he travelled frequently by passenger trains as he was a marketing executive and he had trouble in writing his travel claim forms, as the tickets were only in English. He only knows to read and write in Tamil. “I used to write down the destination based on the fare. Now with Tamil on the ticket it is very helpful,’’ he said.
