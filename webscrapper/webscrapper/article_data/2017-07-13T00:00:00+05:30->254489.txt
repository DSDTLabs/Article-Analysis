The Queer Arts Movement — India (QAMI) is back with   that kicks off this weekend. With over 20 artists, QAMI Habba will have performances ranging from drag, poetry, and dance and will also have workshops and film screening with an aim of bringing queer perspective into mainstream.
Speaking to BT, Romal Laisram, Founder, QAMI, said, “The idea behind QAMI is to bring queer perspective into mainstream but through performances. We believe that the message of ‘whom we choose to be with’ is easily spread through performances and we want inclusion of tolerance and love,” adding that the habba not only works with queer but with allies as well. “We open the stage for everyone. So it’s not just queer people performing but allies also who also spread the message,” he says.
 Speaking about one of the performances, Men Can Mohiniattam, Romal says, “We try to bring different perspectives into the performances so that we can challenge notions. The idea behind Men Can Mohiniattam is that the art itself, usually performed by women, can be taken up by men as well. For a foreigner ( ) to come to Kerala and find a guru who can teach him the art and then to go on and perform it in itself speaks about breaking gender barriers.” Similarly performance by   is all about how the society tries to suppress women, he sums up.
