THIRUVANANTHAPURAM : The Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) here has initiated a probe into an allegation that medical negligence had killed a lady doctor under treatment at the centre.

  Dr Paul Sebastian ordered the probe after the deceased woman’s husband, Ras al-Khaimah-based Reji—also a doctor—circulated a video on social media saying his wife was killed due to medical negligence in March.
 
 
 The probe ordered to find whether there was any lapse on part of the doctors as described by Dr Reji.

The details of this investigation done by that hospital must be given to probe team,” said a doctor from the RCC.
