CHIKKAMAGALURU/MYSURU: Even as the   government is engaged in a close fight with the   in the bypolls to two assembly constituencies in the   region, the   has asked the Siddaramaiah government to resolve the administrative and religious affairs of the Sri Guru Dattatreya Baba Budan Swamy Dargah in  . 

 The issue could take on a political hue in the communally sensitive Chikkamagaluru district and have have an impact in Malnad districts and the coastal region. 
 
 Hearing an interim appeal of Syed Gouse Mohiuddin Shah Kh adri, who claims to be Sajjada Nasheen or religious head of the dargah at the disputed cave shrine on Baba Budangiri hills, the apex court on Monday directed the state government to decide on the report of the commissioner referred to in its order dated September 3, 2015, within six weeks starting March 27. 
 
 Though the court had asked the government to decide in its earlier order in September 20 15 in connection with civil appeal numbers 2685 and 2686/2010, the issue wasn't solved because it is a highly emotive issue. 
 
  Khadri told TOI that he had petitioned the apex court claiming that the government has violated the apex court's order and not taken any step as directed. He said the state had taken over muzrai institution (dargah) and had tried to oust the legally appointed Sajjada Nasheen and substituted the post with a committee to manage the dargah affairs. Sajjada Nasheen is also restricted from entering the dargah and even from performing any religious duties and functions and not participating in the annual Sandal Urus held every March/April. 
 
  The shrine is guarded by police round the clock and the district administration had restricted any rituals within 200 metres of the cave. The shrine, spread over 14 acres, 15 guntas, is located 6250ft above mean sea level.
