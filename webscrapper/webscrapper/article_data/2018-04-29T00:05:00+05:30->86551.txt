Salem: Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami should step down taking responsibility for the gutka scam as he holds the police portfolio, said the Karnataka secretary of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), V Pugazhendhi, here on Saturday.

 Speaking to reporters, he also urged the state government to take action against the ministers and officials involved in the case.
 
 Pugazhendhi expressed hope that in the disqualification of 18 MLAs case, the Madras high court would rule in their favour. The MLAs were disqualified for extending support to T T V Dhinakaran.
 
 Referring to the Cauvery Management Board, he said it would not happen until prime minister Narendra Modi was in power.
 
 On Karnataka assembly election, he predicted tough competition between Congress and Janata Dal. “We will appeal the people not to vote for BJP candidates,” he said.
