Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will be adding 50 new BRTS buses by the end of January and 300 city buses by April. The civic body expects 3.5 lakh passengers to used SMC’s public transport services on daily basis by year-end.  Meanwhile, SMC also launched a mobile application for issuing tickets in city bus and BRTS routes. This mobile application would allow citizens to get information on buses, book tickets and information on location they want to visit.  “We only hope more people start using public transport which will reduce the problem of traffic congestion and pollution,” assistant commissioner BRTS Kamesh Nayak said.
