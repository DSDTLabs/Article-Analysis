NEW DELHI:   president   said Prime Minister   should know that he would not be able to win the trust of Dalits no matter how many Ambedkar statues he garlands because of his “regressive mindset” about the community.

 
 Rahul upped the aggression against   on the simmering   front as he launched the “save the Constitution” campaign organised by AICC’s scheduled castes cell chaired by Nitin Raut, aimed at mobilising the key community.
 
 Accusing BJP of suppressing institutions like the Supreme Court, the Congress president said it was the first time that four senior most judges of the apex court had to run to the public to seek justice, referring to their January 12 press conference.
 
 “Modi is only interested in Modi, in how he can become the Prime Minister,” he said. He also blamed the Centre for rising atrocities on Dalits and poor, and rapes of minor girls.
 
 Rahul said PM Modi was afraid of facing Parliament because of glaring instances of corruption and malgovernance. “Let me speak for 15 minutes on Rafale, Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi, and Modi will not be able to stand there,” the Congress leader said.
 
 Rahul started his speech by citing Modi’s comments about Dalits from his book “Karmayogi”. He said the PM felt if Dalits had stuck to cleaning toilets for generations, it must be for reasons beyond “filling their belly”, because they found the experience “spiritual”.
 
 Rahul’s riposte appeared targeted at PM’s comment at the recent inauguration of “Ambedkar National Memorial” where he accused Congress of humiliating the Dalit icon during his lifetime in contrast to BJP government unveiling many memorials of the emancipator.
 
  SC cell chairman Nitin Raut said the campaign will travel across states till April 14, 2019. The function was attended by party leaders Ashok Gehlot, Mallikarjuna Kharge, among others.
