PANAJI: There will be no change in the number of engineering degree seats on offer in Goa for the academic year 2018-19 as there are no further expansions on the cards for the five engineering institutes in the state. 

  
 
 “No proposal has come from any   to up its seats. At 1,230, Goa already has more than sufficient engineering degree seats on offer. Most of the seats go full. However, Shiroda’s Rayeshwar Institute of Engineering and Information Technology is finding it difficult to fill some of its seats,” an official of the directorate of technical education (DTE) said.
 
 Officials said that besides the state engineering colleges already having their hands full, Goa also got its own   (IIT) and National Institute of Technology (NIT), in recent years.
 
 “More students than ever in Goa are aspiring to join the national technology institutes and are answering the IITJEE. So there is no need felt for further expansion in Goa,” the official said.
 
 Goa College of Engineering, Farmagudi, Padre Conceicao College of Engineering, Verna, Shree Rayeshwar Institute of Engineering and Information Technology, Shiroda, Don Bosco College of Engineering, Fatorda and Agnel Institute of Technology and Design, Assagao, together have 1,230 seats on offer. Don Bosco College of Engineering and Agnel Institute of Technology and Design are two of the recent colleges to offer the engineering programmes in Goa and when these institute became operational, Goa’s engineering seats shot up by around 400.
 
 No major expansion in the seats in engineering has taken place since Agnel Institute of Technology and Design became operational in 2011.
