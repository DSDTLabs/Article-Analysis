LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on Monday issued notice to Attorney General of India on a petition seeking disqualification of chief minister Aditya Nath   and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad   from their respective posts. The court set the matter for next hearing on May 24. 

 A division bench comprising justice   and justice Virendra   (II) passed the order on the public interest litigation petition filed by Sanjai Sharma.
 
 The petitioner pleaded that a parliamentarian cannot not become minister of a state government and this violates article 101(2) of the Constitution and as such the appointment of Yogi as chief minister and Maurya as deputy chief minister should be set aside as both are continuing as parliamentarians. The petition also seeks parliamentary seats of Yogi and Keshav be declared vacant.
 
 The petitioner further seeks to challenge the constitutionality of section 3(A) of the Prevention of Disqualification Act. Since the constitutionality of a Central act cannot be tested without hearing the Attorney General, the court issued the notice.
