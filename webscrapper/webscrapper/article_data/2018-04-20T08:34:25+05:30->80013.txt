JAIPUR: Residents of   sector 8, had a close shave on Friday after at least three   cylinders, stored on the ground floor of a house for illegal LPG refiling, exploded in quick succession, injuring two kids living on the second floor.

 The incident occurred at 1.30 pm when a burning cylinder tore through the wall of the house and landed on a car parked outside the house, as the car went up in flames, the neighbours heard the loud explosion and informed fire and police departments.
 
 Fire official   told   that the illegal business of LPG refilling was running from the ground floor of the house while a family lived on the second floor. 
 
 “The LPG was refilled from commercial cylinder into domestic ones. There were many cylinders lying there. It is suspected that there was a gas leak which triggered fire,”   told TOI.
 
 The two kids were rushed to the nearby hospital where they were released after treatment. The police said that efforts are being made to identify the person who was running the LPG business.
 
 The primary investigation indicates that these were commercial cylinders which caught fire. 
 
 “Initial investigation suggests that the business of refilling was conducted without proper permission. We are making efforts to identify the owners,” an official said.
 
 Meanwhile, the house was charred in the explosion and ensuing flames. As many as five fire tenders were pressed into service. The fire department officials said that there were total 15 commercial LPG cylinders that were found from the spot and quickly brought out of the house in order to prevent them from catching fire.
 
 The explosion triggered panic in the area with many people rushing out of their houses in the fear that the rising flames may spread to their houses. The fire department said that it could have been worse as the house was located in a narrow alley.
