AHMEDABAD: Justice J B Pardiwala of Gujarat high court on Thursday recused himself from proceedings on a quashing petition filed by social activist  .

 The judge said “not before me” to Setalvad’s lawyer and commented that he would prefer to stay out of controversy because such a case is widely reported in media, sources said. Justice Pardiwala had denied Setalvad and her husband   anticipatory bail in connection with allegations of fraud by former residents of Gulbarg Society. The court had then castigated the functioning of NGOs. In this petition, Setalvad urged the court to quash an FIR filed by Ghatlodia police for her posting on Twitter juxtaposed images of a Hindu deity and journalist   with an ISIS terrorist a couple of years ago.
 
 Setalvad was booked in two police stations in the city, as members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Shiv Sena took exception to her posting the two pictures – the ISIS militant and photo-shopped images of Hindu imagery such as Sudarshan Chakra and goddess Kali. The complainant Raju Patel claimed he was offended at seeing the image on his Facebook page. Setalvad was booked under sections 153A, 295A of IPC, and under provisions of the Information Technology Act for the alleged attempt at promoting enmity among different groups and for deliberate and malicious act intended to outrage religious feelings of a class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs.
