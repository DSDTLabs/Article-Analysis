NAGPUR: Within a few weeks, schools in the district will receive 27% of their pending   bills and the education department has already started completing the paperwork for it. TOI was the first to report about Rs12 crore being received by the local department for pending RTE payments, against a demand of Rs45 crore. 
 
 Since a lump sum amount has been received by the education department there was confusion among schools about how much they will each get. Dipendra  , district education officer (primary), said, “The money will be given to schools in the same percentage as received by us. The amount may differ for each school but the percentage figure will be same.” 
 
 Since around 27% of the demanded payment has been received, schools too will get reimbursement in the same ratio. Lokhande, said, “All schools will get reimbursements and I have already asked my officials to double check all details with schools.”
 
 Though schools welcome the partial RTE payments, it won’t soothe the strain in their relationship with the education department. Already over two dozen schools in Nagpur have decided to refuse RTE admissions till entire amount is paid back to them. A school trustee, said, “This piecemeal approach won’t work. Can we pay our teachers in parts? Our vendors who are providing security, upgrading digital classrooms etc need to be paid regularly as well. And all this we have been managing with just 75% of revenue.” 
 
 Another trustee who has registered for RTE but is now thinking of joining the boycotting schools association, said, “The government seems to jumped into the RTE policy of free 25% admissions without thinking about the repercussions. They have not taken into account the huge fees that would have to be given to schools and now are backing out.”
