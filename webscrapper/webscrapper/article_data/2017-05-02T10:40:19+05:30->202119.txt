CHENNAI: Three years ago on May 1,  , 24, died after a   on the Guwahati-Bangalore Express at Chennai Central. A few days later, the then   general manager   announced that May 1 would be observed as 'Swati Day' in her memory and sensitisation programmes would be held. But, the promise has quietly been forgotten.

 “Railways would also distribute precaution pamphlets to passengers to draw their attention to security-related issues on that day . We will rededicate ourselves to passenger security and review our security apparatus top to bottom.
 
 We will also conduct security seminars and sensitizing sessions for all our frontline staff so that our vigil could be strengthened,“ said Rakesh Misra, in a condolence meeting held a few days after Swati's death.
 
  A check with railway officials and   (RPF) personnel in Chennai shows that no such programme was organised in the past three years. Even this year, Monday was a regular day at the railway stations.
 
 “We also heard of the announcement, but there seems to have been no progress. However, we conduct our regular recces and have standard operating procedures as far as security at the station is concerned. We have also become more citizen friendly,“ an RPF officer said. 
 
 Southern Railway's official spokesperson could not be reached for comment, but sources said there was no mov from the Railway Board to observe  
 
 Swati, a techie, was travelling to Guntur, her hometown, when the blast killed her.
 
 Police closed the case after the three accused named in the FIR by Tamil Nadu's CBCID were shot dead by police in 2015 and 2016.
