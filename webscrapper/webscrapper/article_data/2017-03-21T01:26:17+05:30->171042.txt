THANE: An eight-year-old   was   on Saturday morning near   railway station. However, the monkey was found almost 30 hours after the incident on Sunday evening. 

 An  , Wildlife Welfare Association (WWA), had reached the spot after they had received a call from a commuter about the monkey.
 
 “I had received a call on Saturday morning about the incident but when our team had reached the spot they did not find the animal. So, we suspected that the monkey must have gone away. However, we searched the entire area and also nearby places. We also informed the station manager about the incident and asked him to contact us if he or his staff spotted the monkey,’’ said Aditya Patil, president of WWA.
 
 However, the NGO received a call again from a few residents near B-cabin road who claimed that an   monkey was roaming in the area. A team reached the spot immediately. 
 
 “The monkey kept running from once place to another and eventually got stuck in a washroom. After almost three hours we were able to rescue him. We first held him with the help of a grasper and then he was put in a gunny bag so that he doesn’t get aggressive. We then put him inside a cage and slowly removed the bag,” added Patil.
 
 The monkey was immediately taken to Thane SPCA’s Animal Hospital and Emergency Centre for treatment.
 
 “He suffered burns all over his body. There are chances that he might be having internal wounds. He is currently under observation,” said Dr. Maghesh Gaikwad, a vet from  .
