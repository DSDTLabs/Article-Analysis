NEW DELHI: A   leader from  's Ballia district installed a poster outside the party office in Lucknow, announcing a reward of Rs 5 lakh for anyone who finds   and brings him before party workers. 

 Noted election strategist Kishor, who was hired by the Congress to help it win the crucial assembly elections in five states, is reportedly untraceable after the party's defeat in state elections
 
 Rajesh Singh, a secretary in the   Committee, claimed to have put up the poster on behalf of "all Congress workers".
  
  
 He also said that party workers needed some answers this time.
 
 “For the last one year, we did all the hard work…. We followed him (Kishor) without any ifs and buts… We thought it was best for the the party. But now we need answers,” Singh said.
 
 However, Congress state president   had directed the party workers for immediate removal of the poster. 
 
 "It is too early to blame anyone for the poll debacle," Babbar said while talking to reporters.
