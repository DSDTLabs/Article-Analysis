GURUGRAM: Huda on Tuesday terminated the lease agreement with a tent house and sealed its banquet hall constructed on an open space on the premises of   in Sector 29, following a directive from a city court on Monday.

 In its order, additional district judge   observed that the (club) management (Huda) was not required to assign any reason for cancelling the agreement before its expiry, while rejecting a plea filed by Billu Tent House.
 
 The tent house had submitted before the court that it had deposited a rent of Rs 17.46 lakh in advance and thus, the lease could not be terminated arbitrarily. It also said even if the lease was terminated, it could not be thrown out of the premises, except in accordance with the due process of law. It was not an encroacher and had invested a huge amount in raising the structure (banquet hall), the tent house management contended. But the court maintained that the tent house could not seek to restrain Huda from terminating the lease. However, the (club) management shall have to refund the rent paid and investments made on the plot, it added.
 
 “The area leased out to the tent house has been sealed after the court order,” a senior Huda official confirmed on Tuesday. Also, the authorities constituted a committee under PWD (B&R) to assess the expenditure incurred by the tent house on the premises and calculate the total compensation to be paid by Huda.
 
 The court order has been welcomed by the club members, who had been up in arms against Huda for leasing out the open space to the tent house for a nominal rent in September 2017.
 
 After taking possession of the land, the ten house management built a banquet hall and other structures, triggering protests by the club members against alleged irregularities. “The lease was a massive scam, causing huge losses to the state exchequer,” said  , a member of the club. Huda officials and politicians were hand in glove with the tent house management, he alleged.
