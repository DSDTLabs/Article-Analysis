GHAZIABAD: The   has a green plan for the tonnes of civic waste generated in the city every day.

 The corporation plans to produce electricity from the waste in a waste-to-energy plant on a newly acquired 18-acre plot of land in Galand in the city’s first solid waste management plant. According to   municipal commissioner C P Singh, an expression of interest has been invited for the waste-to-energy plant.
 
 “The concept of power generation from civic waste is not new and the technology is being used in Lucknow and elsewhere in the country,” Singh said. He said civic waste management has always been an issue in Ghaziabad and currently the   landfill site, which was being used for dumping civic waste, is brimming with vast heaps of garbage.
 
 “But in the wake of the   handing over 18 acres of land in Galand to the GMC for developing the solid waste management plant we plan to make use of waste in generating power,” Singh said. He said an expression of interest has been invited for the same.
 
 Singh said that currently the city generates about 1,200 to 1,300 metric tons of civic waste every day which is being dumped at the Pratap Vihar landfill site. 
 
 “Although we will be shifting the landfill site from Pratp Vihar to Galand shortly it will not solve the problem of civic waste management in the city, so the idea of a waste-to-energy plant was conceived and things are moving according to plan,” Singh said.
 
 “With the help of the waste-to-energy plant we will prevent Galand plant from turning into something like the Ghazipur landfill site because about 90% of waste will go into producing electricity and with 1,500 metric tons we will be able to produce 15MW of energy,” Singh said.
 
 The estimated cost of setting up of the waste-to-energy plant is Rs 160 crore and it will take two years to fully develop it.
