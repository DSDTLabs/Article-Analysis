NEW DELHI: The Navy today cheekily let China's naval force know, "we see you on the  ".
 
 It did that by tweeting a "warm welcome" to three warships of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (Navy) (PLA-N)) that entered the Indian Ocean region (IOR). 
 
 The Navy then added "happy hunting" to its welcome message to the Chinese navy ships, which Beijing says belong to the 29th Anti-Piracy Escort Force of the PLA-N in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).
 
  
  
 China often projects its Navy deployments as being aimed at piracy, when it is stealthily setting up bases in the IOR for research and with submarines. 
 
 The   followed its welcome tweet to another tweet that showed a map of its warships on vigil 24/7 to keep our 'Area of Responsibility' safe.
 
 
  
  
 India was making sure China was aware the Indian Navy has a strong presence on the Indian Ocean and has the ability to monitor the vast stretch of waters round-the-clock, at a time when Beijing's vessels are increasingly making their presence felt in the IOR.
 
 
 Under the Navy's 'Mission Based Deployment,' a fleet of 50 of its combat-ready warships is presently deployed in the IOR - including in the Strait of Malacca - which enables India to carry out round-the-clock surveillance.
 
 In an exclusive interview to TOI in February, Navy chief Admiral   confirmed that there has been a noticeable increase in the deployment of Chinese submarines and research vessels in the IOR.
 
 
 "While the early Chinese deployments were projected as anti-piracy deployments, the setting up of bases and the increasing presence of their flotilla have implications for the regional security environment," said Lanba.
 
 The Indian Navy has been closely tracking the increasing Chinese naval presence in IOR, and as per Lanba, it is well prepared to counter any threat to national security.
