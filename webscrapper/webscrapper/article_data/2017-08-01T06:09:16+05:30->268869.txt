NEW DELHI: With   member   continuing to make controversial statements, the Supreme Court decided on Monday to examine a plea seeking the revival of the case filed against him last year for terming the Bulandshahr gang-rape case “the outcome of a political conspiracy”.

 Taking strong exception to Khan’s insensitive remarks about the alleged gang rape of a minor and her mother on a UP highway, the court had last year initiated proceedings against him.
 
 Attorney general   told a bench of Justice   and Justice A M Khanwilkar on Monday that Khan was a habitual offender, and continued to make controversial statements after the SC let him off in the Bulandshahr case following an unconditional apology.
 
 Venugopal cited Khan’s recent derogatory comments against the  , for which he is being prosecuted under the charge of sedition.
 
 Contending that the court should not have let him off, Venugopal said Khan should have been prosecuted for interference in administration of justice as he was a minister at that time and his statement had interfered in the probe. “It was an atrocious statement. A minister cannot make such kind of statements. He was actually saying that the mother and daughter were lying. It is a fit case to proceed under Section 186 of IPC (obstructing public servant in discharge of functions). He was actually directing the state police to accept his stand and close the case. Fortunately, the   took over the probe in the case,” he said.
 
 Venugopal, however, made it clear that he was not speaking on behalf of the Centre and just assisting the court on legal issues involved in the case. Senior advocate  , who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, supported Venugopal’s contention and said that the SC should set a principle that holders of constitutional posts could not make such statements in cases of ongoing probe.
