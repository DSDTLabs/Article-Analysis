MUMBAI: The 21-year-old   homemaker who got a nod from   to undergo medical termination of her 25-week pregnancy, got admitted to state government-run J   in Byculla on Saturday. Her foetus was diagnosed with an anomaly—cerebral aqueductal stenosis causing hydrocephalus or fluid buildup in the brain—after the permissible limit of 20 weeks, forcing her to move the Supreme Court for medical termination. “As this is a second trimester  , it is like a mini labour. We have induced labour and it will take some time for the baby to be delivered,” said Dr Ashok Anand, who heads the hospital’s gynaceology department, on Saturday evening.
