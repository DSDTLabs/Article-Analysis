 R H Mohammad, presiding member of the tribunal, ruled that 30% of the compensation amount be given to the cictim’s widow, 20% each to his son, daughter and father and the remaining 10% to his mother. 
  
  
 Ramdas Dnyaneshwar Kale was walking alon the road from Saal to   on February 18, 2016 when a scooter came from the wrong side and hit him. Kale succumbed to his injuries at a   hospital on February 20.
 
 Though the scooter belonged to one Sanjay  , his friend, Yogesh Suresh Shinde, was riding it. 
 
 In March, Kale’s widow, Namrata (39), son, Hrishikesh (17), daughter, Vaishnavi (14), father, Dnyaneshwar (81) and mother, Heerbai (74), jointly moved a claim petition before the tribunal, stating that the deceased was the sole bread winner in the family and they were dependent on his monthly salary of Rs 76,000. 
 
 During the trial, the insurer maintained that the accident was not caused by the scooter. Moreover, it argued that the scooter was not being driven by Shinde, but by some unauthorised person without a driving licence. It also suggested during the cross-examination of Namrata, it was found that the accident was caused by a tractor. However, this was denied by the witness. 
 
 Tribunal member Mohammad said the police had registered a case against Shinde and even chargesheeted him. The insruance company did not examine any witness in support of its claim, the tribunal said. The evidence recorded by Namrata was corroborated by the police investigation papers and other evidence to prove that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving by Shinde.
