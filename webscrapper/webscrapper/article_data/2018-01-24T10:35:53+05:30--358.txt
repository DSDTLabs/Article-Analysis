MADRID:  's goal after just 24 seconds set   on their way to a 3-1 win over   and a place in the   semi-finals on Tuesday.

 Sevilla, finalists in 2016, were in charge of this quarter-final with a 2-1 first leg success.
 
 And Escudero's lightning contribution all but sealed Atletico's fate.
 
  levelled on the night with a sublime lob in the 13th minute, but the second half was only minutes old when   scored from the penalty spot to put Sevilla back in charge.
 
 Pablo Sarabia bagged Sevilla's third in the 79th minute with a frustrated Atletico coach Diego Simeone sent to the stands at the end of the tie.
 
 On Wednesday Real Madrid, leading 1-0 after the first leg, host Leganes with Alaves facing Levantes, while on Thursday Barcelona complete the quarter-finals against Espanyol.
