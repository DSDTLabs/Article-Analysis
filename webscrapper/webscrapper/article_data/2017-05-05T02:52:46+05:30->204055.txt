KOLKATA:   could “win over” the   from   but not those on the  . The Mandals and Baidyas of Chetla Lockgate slum who played host to   are not in two minds. On the contrary, college student Atanu Mandal promised in front of BJP leader Locket Chatterjee on Thursday that he won’t go for an action replay of the Naxalbari episode.

 Learning it the hard way from Naxalbari, BJP activists in Bhowanipore have formed a “protection committee” for the Chetla slum to thwart incursions into the Trinamool camp. 
 
 Sandhya Baidya, a homemaker, was more than happy when Chatterjee went straight to her home. Chatterjee accepted rosogolla and fruits offered by Baidya. Chatterjee then visited Kalpana Mandal’s home. Mandal welcomed her with a glass of juice. Mandal’s son Atanu stood by her mother when Chatterjee was taking stock of the situation of the slum after Shah’s visit.
 
 Chatterjee will brief the situation to state BJP president Dilip Ghosh. “They are brave people and won’t give in under any circumstances. Let Trinamool leaders try their best to convert them, I am confident these people will teach them a lesson,” Chatterjee told reporters. Atanu Mandal conceded that Shah’s visit had created an enthusiasm among local youths to join BJP.
