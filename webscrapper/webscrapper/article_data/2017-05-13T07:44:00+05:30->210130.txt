GREATER NOIDA: Residents of Sector Beta 1 in   have been receiving dirty water in the taps for more than a week now. They have also written to   officials against the rampant encroachments in the sector.

 “The water supplied by the   for the past one week has been full of mud. It almost seems we are getting sewer water in our taps,” said Anita  , a resident of Sector Beta 1.
 
 According to Anju Pundir, a resident of C-370, Beta 1, the water pressure is another issue. “The pressure is low and inadequate for household consumption unless stored beforehand,” Pundir said.
 
 Harinder Bhati,   general secretary sector Beta 1, said that almost all blocks — A, B, C, D and E — of Sector Beta 1 have been getting dirty water supply for the past week. “Repeated complaints to Authority officials have yielded no results so far,” Bhati said. However, according to B P Singh senior manager water (supply), GNIDA, the reason was faulty pipelines and the issue is being looked into.
 
 “The dirty water supply could be because of leakages in distribution pipelines. We will get it checked,” Singh said. Meanwhile, the residents are also troubled by rampant encroachment.
 
 When contacted, R R P Singh told TOI that removing these encroachments was being done by the department on a daily basis but it was only a temporary solution. “The problem calls for a permanent redress,” he said.
