Surat: One of the key accused in the case of extortion calls made to BJP leader and developer Premchand Lalvani of Navsari, was arrested on Wednesday from National Highway 48 near Vesma of Navsari. 

 The accused was identified as Naeem Sadiq Patel, 41, a resident of Valar village near Karjan in Vadodara. Patel had escaped to   of South Africa after a complaint was registered against him. He had recently returned to Surat. Police said, they stopped an SUV on the highway in which Patel was going to Mumbai. Police seized the car and other valuables worth Rs 8 lakh from the accused.
 
 Lalvani had received threat call with demand of ransom of Rs one crore over phone in January after which police nabbed Saeed Mustaq Patel, 24, of Bharuch, Yagnesh Maisuriya, of Navsari, and Yamin Yusuf Patel, 21, of Amroli in Surat. Investigation revealed that Patel had borrowed Maisuriya’s mobile phone to make the extortion call and gave it to Yamin, who ultimately handed it over to Saeed. The calls were made by Saeed but police found that it was the plan of Patel to run an extortion racket. Lalvani also received extortion calls again in February from gangster Ravi Pujari’s gang.
