MUMBAI: The state government has issued a fresh licence to the   ( ) to conduct racing for the 2017-18 season from July 1.

 Interestingly, the controversial addendum, which restricted members from voting unless they have attended at least 15% of race days, has been excluded from the list of licensing conditions.
 
  and four other members had challenged the addendum by filing a writ and the   stayed the case on the grounds that the government had no power to issue a midterm amendment.
 
 On the voting rights issue, the licence now states, "The licensee shall frame guidelines that will precisely define a regular racegoer in terms of Article 7 of the Club's Articles and send such guidelines to the government for approval within three months from the license date."
 
 "I have always stated that putting a condition which restricts the members from their rights to vote isn't just unprecedented, but it also violates both the Articles and Companies Act. The government seems to have appreciated this stand.
 
 "Requesting the RWITC managing committee to suggest guidelines is the right way forward, as it can consider both sides of the argument before a decision is made. I hope a compromise can be found, but as it would amount to amending Article 7, the consent of members would be necessary," RWITC chairman   told TOI.
