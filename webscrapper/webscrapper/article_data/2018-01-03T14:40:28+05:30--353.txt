COIMBATORE: Several hundred doctors staged a protest against the National Medical Commission Bill in the city on Tuesday.

 Apart from the doctors from the private hospitals, government hospital doctors also took part in the protest. 
 
 President of the Coimbatore chapter of   said the Bill was not a good idea as many untrained doctors would crop up. 
 
 “This Bill will lead to abolishment of Medical Council of India (MCI) and Section 15 of IMC Act which has set MBBS as the minimum qualification to practice medicine. People from any profession will now take up medicine and even start colleges and institutes. This will completely be dangerous for the profession,” the protesting doctors said. 
 
 The doctors also urged the state government to oppose the Bill and not implement it.
