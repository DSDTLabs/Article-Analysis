NAVI MUMBAI: After the death of a 12-year-old boy inside an under-construction NMMC school in sector 11, Bonkode,   on Friday, local residents and activists have alleged large-scale corruption and criminal negligence involved in constructing the still incomplete building. 

  Saurabh Chaudhari had died after the metal gate at the entrance of the school fell on him, leading to fatal head injuries and injured his 14-year-old friend.
 
 “The under-construction school building is still not functional due to endless delays. In November 2016, the then municipal commissioner, Tukaram Mundhe had ordered an audit inquiry as to how the cost of this school building construction escalated from Rs 15 crore to nearly Rs 31 crore in a few years,'' said RTI activist Anarjit Chauhan.
 
 He added that a group of citizens and activists will be approaching senior   officials to demand a time-bound completion of the audit inquiry into the building construction, and legal action against those involved in escalating the building cost. 
 
 Another city activist Saurabh Pandya said, “We visited the unfinished school building and found that there was no board or name title as to which contractor is in charge of its construction. Several rules are being flouted, which shows a careless attitude of those in charge.”
 
 NMMC commissioner,   said, “A departmental inquiry is on against senior civic engineer,  , in this connection. The cost of the three-phased construction of the school building had escalated since 2009 which led to the audit in 2016. I have told the concerned officers that we intend to start the school from this year under CBSE board and take action against those responsible for the delays.”
