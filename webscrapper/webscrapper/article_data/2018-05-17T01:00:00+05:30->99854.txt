GAYA: The Gaya district administration and police will soon launch an extensive anti-encroachment drive to regulate traffic and end the unending snarls in Gaya town.

 Gaya Sadar SDO Suraj Kumar Sinha informed that the drive will begin this weekend. In the initial stage, the drive will be launched on GB Road, KP Road, Dak Bungalow Road, Ramna Road and Swarajpuri Road among several other areas. “We have also received complaints of extortion from vendors. Shop owners levy charges on vendors for allowing them to do business on footpath in front of their respective establishments,” said SDO Sinha.
 
 As per the recent report submitted by the SDO to Gaya district magistrate suggesting a new traffic plan, more roads would be brought under one-way mode. As of now, one way rules are applied only on GB Road and Ramna Road. Here too, the implementation has been slow and violations are common.
 
 Sources said there is shortage of trained traffic personnel and deployment of homeguard jawans for traffic control.
