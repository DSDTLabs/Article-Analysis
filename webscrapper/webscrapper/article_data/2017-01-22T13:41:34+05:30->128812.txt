GUWAHATI: Assam’s ruling   (BJP) could seek an explanation from its Raha legislator Dimbeswar Das for ‘forcing’ a junior engineer to touch his feet as an act of apology. 

 In a video footage captured by several television channels, engineer   is seen touching the legislator’s feet during an inspection at Kothiatoli Development Block in   district on Thursday. 
 
 Dimbeswar was allegedly annoyed with   for removing his car, which was parked in front of an official building. Though both parties denied that any such incident took place, television cameras captured the   rebuking Jayanta. A senior Bharatiya Janata Party member said the party will soon writeto the legislator to explain his position.
 
 “It is our duty to maintain the dignity of the party. This incident has hurt us and we are looking into what exactly transpired,” the party functionary, who is also a legislator, said. Das said he has not received any communication from the party. “The incident has been blown out of proportion with the sole intention to tarnish my image. I am saddened with these allegations of forcing a junior engineer to touch my feet. These charges are false and baseless. The junior engineer and I also had lunch together,” he said.
