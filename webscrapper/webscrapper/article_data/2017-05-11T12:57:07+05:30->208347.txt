PUNE: Parents   state education minister Vinod   on Wednesday during the 53rd foundation day ceremony of   where he was the chief guest. 

 They were protesting against the increase in the fees in private schools and accused Tawde of refusing to meet them or take any action over the hike.
 
 “The government is doing nothing to control the fee hike in private schools. When any of the parent representatives go to meet him, he refuses to give us a time. The schools make it compulsory to buy books or uniforms or material which are of high cost, yet no action is taken against them. Only promises are made,” a parent said.
 
 Tawde said he had received 32 complaints of fee hike in schools and had resolved them all. “Both parents and schools’ representatives were called for discussions. In the next four days, we will call them and resolve this. Within a few days, all these problems will be solved,” he added. 
 
 At the foundation day ceremony, Tawde said, “Many CBSE and ICSE schools take high fees which is not affordable. We are strengthening the fee regulation Act so that schools are not able to raise fees as per their whims and fancies. We want our kids to study in good schools. Unfortunately, when a parent enrols his ward in a school, the fee is different from what the school demands in the later years. There is not much in the clause to take action in the current Fee Regulation Act due to which the Act lacks teeth.”
 
 Only 1.3% of the research work done for a PhD is useful for society. The rest is most probably copied and pasted, education minister Vinod Tawde said. “It seems people are doing their doctorates to get increments or better posts like a principal or an HoD. A PhD should be done for research that is useful. We have told colleges to send their research work online to the university.”
