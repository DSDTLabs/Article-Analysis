Every month, 12 eggs will be given to malnourished child, eight to the normal child and seven to their mothers,” ICDS monitoring officer Kavi Priya said at a programme organised by Poshan, a non-government organisation, here on Thursday.
 
 Citing National Family Health Survey-4 and 5 reports and the data released by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), experts at the programme said the state had made considerable progress in improving the nutritional status of women and children in the past one decade. “The prevalence of stunting, which reflects chronic undernutrition during the most critical periods of growth and development in early life, has shown a decline in the state,” Priya said.
