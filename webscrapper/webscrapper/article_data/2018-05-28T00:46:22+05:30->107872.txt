NEW DELHI:   Satyendra Jain has ordered that   (OTs) in   be fixed at the earliest. This directive comes after TOI reported how 31 out of 183 OTs are non-functional due to lack of equipment or pending civil work. Shortage of staff — anaesthetists, assistants and technicians — is another major crisis.

 “Some of the problems have been fixed already. I have asked the medical directors of all hospital to submit a list of requirements to make the rest of the OTs functional too,” Jain said.
 
 Following orders from chief minister  , sources said, the state health department collated information on non-functional OTs in hospitals. The chief minister had sought a timeline from the departments concerned to get things moving. 
 
 On being told that it might take six months to a year to do so, the CM expressed strong displeasure, said an official.
 
 Doctors say non-functional OTs was a cause of delay in surgeries at state-run hospitals.
