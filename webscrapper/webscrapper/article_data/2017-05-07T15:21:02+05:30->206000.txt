NEW DELHI: Former   president N   on Sunday had to backtrack after initially suggesting that a notice be sent to the   for reducing India's revenue share from $570 million to $293 million.

 In fact, eyebrows were raised as to how the 71-year-old Tamil Nadu strongman, for the first time in a BCCI meeting, faced resistance and had to pull back.
 
 "I won't say there was confrontation. But when Mr Srinivasan joined the   via Skype, the first thing he spoke about was issuing a notice to ICC. There was immediate objection from   president Abhay Apte and IPL GC chairman  . Srinivasan didn't expect that," a state unit official present at the meeting, told PTI.
 
 "The main objection was that sending a notice would jeopardise India's chances as a 30-day cure of breach period would only end after June 4. A few others also voiced their dissent.
 
 "Suddenly Srinivasan gauged that this is not the BCCI that he ruled with iron hand. He agreed and said 'I am not in war with ICC. I also want cricket to continue'."
 
 When   head   was asked about Srinivasan attending the meeting, he didn't want to read too much into the matter.
