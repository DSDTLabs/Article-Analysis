CHENNAI: In an effort to fund construction of homes for economically weaker sections (EWS) in urban centres, the   government has introduced a "shelter fund" cess on other buildings. Roughly six lakh dwelling units would be constructed across the state using that fund, including about 1.5 lakh in Chennai and surrounding areas, said housing and urban development secretary D P Yadav. 

 The fund would add 26 per sqft to the cost of multi-storey residential projects and 52 per sqft to the cost of multi-storey IT, commercial, industrial and institutional buildings. The rates are lower for low-rise institutional and industrial buildings. 
 
  A recently-issued government order says developments up to 3,000 sqm would be exempted from paying the fund that would also not be levied on residential EWS projects measuring up to 50 sqm (538 sq ft) carpet area per unit. The fund is a flat 75% of   and amenities (I&A) charges levied on buildings. All new developments under the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority and Directorate of Town and Country Planning will have to contribute towards shelter fund for getting building plan approval. 
 
 Since January 2008, the state collected 3002.98 crore in I&A charges from developers and individual promoters 285.14 crore in 2015-16 and 313.87 crore in 2016-17.
