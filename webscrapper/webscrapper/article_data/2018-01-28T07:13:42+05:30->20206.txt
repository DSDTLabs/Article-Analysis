KOLKATA:   isn’t elated about being awarded the   at the age of 98. He would rather have preferred martyrdom in his youth. Biswas, who runs homes for destitute — children and elders — is one of the recipients of the   this year.

 Even as Biswas’ ‘family’ at his Sri Ramakrishna Sevashram home rejoiced at the news of their Dadu making the headlines, the nonagenarian regretted a task he couldn’t accomplish seven decades ago. “I left home when I was in Class-VII and joined the revolutionaries after getting in touch with Rishi Aurobindo’s brother, Barin Ghosh. One day, I was entrusted with the mission of targeting Fort William with a bomb. While conducting a recce, police apprehended me and the task remained unaccomplished,” he recounted.
 
 After 29 days in Alipore Jail, Biswas escaped. He and others were underground till a few months after the Independence.
 
 Sometime around 1950-51, he met Vivekananda’s follower Ramananda which changed his life. “Just like Netaji was a revolutionary with the dedication of an ascetic, Vivekananda was a revolutionary among ascetics. This inspired me to set up 16 schools-cum-ashrams in the Sunderbans in the early 1950s,” he said.
 
 A decade later, Biswas set up an ashram in Diamond Harbour’s Hotor with separate units for men and women. After another 10 years, people from his home in Bishupur’s Ramkrishnapur asked him to do something for their village. In 1973, he started an ashram on a 2.5 cottah plot which has now grown to 39 bigha.
 
 At presently, there are 50 orphan boys in the home. Kids are looked after and provided education till they clear their Higher Secondary examinations. “Education is the key to the better future of any nation and I want to continue providing education and other necessities to children,” he said.
