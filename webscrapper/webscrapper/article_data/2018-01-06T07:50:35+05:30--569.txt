 On Monday, two   in search of food. When villagers tried to send the elephants back to the forest by throwing stones and bursting crackers, the calf and its mother got separated. Instead of driving the calf away, locals began clicking selfies with it, taking it farther from its mother. The calf was rescued soon after by forest officials but it was suffering from fever and died on Tuesday.
 
 At first, the mother elephant came looking for it every now and then. Since Thursday, a herd of 10 elephants is wandering near the village. Forest officials are camped there too, in an attempt to drive the herd back into Bandipur tiger reserve.
 
 Forest officials said the   appears to have camped near the spot where the calf was separated from its mother. Naveen Kumar, range forest officer ( ) told TOI that the villagers had blundered by separating the mother and child. “They should have left the calf alone. The mother would have returned to take it back. Now the mother elephant is upset and creating problems,” he said. “The mother doesn’t know that her calf is dead. It may create a bigger ruckus then. It has brought a herd of nine elephants with it. The entire herd is camping near South Lake where the calf was left behind. Till the mother forgets its calf, these elephants will keep roaming in nearby areas.”
 
 Officials said elephants usually search for those left behind for a week at least. “We have buried the calf in a distant place,” Kumar said. “We are trying to send the jumbos back to the forest.”
