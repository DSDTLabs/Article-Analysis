GURUGRAM: The   repair being carried out by   in   has been stalled after residents raised objections citing poor quality of the work. The revamp of the road has been stopped for around 10 days now. Residents alleged that a couple of roads were uneven as only one carriageway had been built so far.

 They alleged that if MCG didn’t increase thickness of the road, it would get washed away during the monsoon.
 
 “Thickness of the road is very less and the number of vehicles that ply on these roads is quite high. We have asked the contractor and authorities to increase the thickness as it will crumble owing to heavy loads of vehicles. We will not allow road construction to go on, if the thickness is not increased. MCG should ensure that the quality of the road is maintained,” said Ankur Sharma, a resident.
 
 Jyoti Singh, another resident of Sector 23, said the contractor has not finished construction of some stretches in the sector, posing threat to motorists and other commuters. “Vehicles coming from both sides tend to use the carriageway that has been constructed, which leads to traffic congestion. The other carriageway is potholed. MCG should ensure that the roads which are half-built are completed to avert accidents,” she said. 
 
 MCG commissioner V Umashankar said he would look into concerns of the residents. “I was told that there is some delay as the contractor is getting some pavers. I am not aware of the reason, but will get it checked. Anyhow specifications of the road have to be finalised before the contract is awarded and cannot be altered after that,” he said.
