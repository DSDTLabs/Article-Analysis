NEW DELHI: The Dalai Lama will be one of the three Nobel laureates to attend the 105th session of Indian Science Congress along with social entrepreneur Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh and physicist   of Japan in   later this week.

 The invite to the Dalai Lama is significant in the context of an attempt by the government to distance itself from the Tibetan spiritual leader to ensure ties with China were not further strained.
 
 The Tibetan governmentin-exile had earlier cancelled an event at Rajghat and shifted another to  , which was meant to commemorate Dalai Lamaâ€™s 60th year in exile in India. The science congress will be inaugurated by PM   on March 16. Modi and the Dalai Lama will not share the dais though as the latter will arrive in Imphal only on March 17. The government recently clarified that there was no change in its Tibet policy.
