HYDERABAD: At a time when the Hyderabad city police is going all out to crack down on coffee shops and other spaces serving  , owners of these cafes allege how the ‘unofficial’ closure is a violation of high court orders as well as their fundamental right to run a business.

 The owners claim that the police are filing false cases against their establishments and insist that the law enforcement authorities should issue a written notice instead of giving verbal notices.
 
 “For the past one year, the police have been conducting random checks and are filing petty cases against us. They are seizing our pots, flavours and other stuff without even issuing panchnamas. I have lost lakhs of rupees because of these illegal seizure of material. Also, if they have really noticed something wrong happening in our centres, why are they filing petty cases?” asked Zishaan, who owns a coffee shop that sells hookah in a posh locality in the   area.
 
 Speaking at a press conference organised by the   on Saturday, owners said that the police are threatening to book them under the preventive detention (PD) Act. Thousands of workers dependent on these shops have lost their livelihood, they rued.
 
 There are about 194 coffee shops and establishments selling hookah in Hyderabad and Cyberabad that employ close to 5,000 people. 
 
 “The apex court ruling is clear and does not ban serving hookah to anyone but minors. It only says that it should be served in a place specified for smoking. Also, under the Cigarettes and other Tobacco, Products (Prohibition of advertisement, and regulation of trade and commerce, production, supply and distribution) Act, 2003, coffee shop owners need not take any license for serving hookah or any tobacco products. In spite of this, police are threatening us. Such illegal acts of the police is against the orders of the court and constitution,” said  , an advocate representing coffee shop owners.
