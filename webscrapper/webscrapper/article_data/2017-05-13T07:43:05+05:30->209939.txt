SURAT: A   in   was gutted in a major fire on Friday evening. The fire was doused by Fire Brigade personnel after two hours. There were no casualties, Fire Brigade sources said, adding that the cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained. 

 Chief fire officer SK Acharya said, “Dee Raj Corporation, which was engaged in processing of white yarn, was gutted in the fire. The two floor structure with tin and steel shed collapsed due to the fire.” 
 
 The building was built exactly at the edge of the creek. The unit had machinery installed on the ground floor and had yarn stock on first and second floors. The fire started at around 5.45pm from the ground floor and spread quickly to engulf the whole unit. 
 
 “It was a major fire and nothing could be saved. We used nearly 25 water tankers for two hours to douse the fire. Luckily there was no one in the building when the fire erupted,” Acharya said.
