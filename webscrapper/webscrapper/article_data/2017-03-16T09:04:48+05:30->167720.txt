BENGALURU: Inspired by the idea of the immensely popular Amma canteens that were launched more than five years ago by J Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu, chief minister   on Wednesday announced that Bengaluru would get 198 Namma Canteens - one for each ward - and allocated a whopping Rs 100 crore for the initiative. 

 Breakfast at Namma Canteens will cost Rs 5, while meals served for lunch and dinner will be priced at Rs 10. The prices are marginally higher in comparison to those at Amma Canteens in Tamil Nadu, where an idli costs Rs 1, curd rice Rs 3 and rice with sambhar Rs 5. However, the success of Jayalalithaa's populist initiative (launched when she was CM) had as much to do with the standards of hygiene that were maintained there, as they did with the prices. From villagers to corporates to the underprivileged, the canteens drew people from all sections of the society. 
 
 However, there was no clarity on whether only the urban poor could avail of the subsidized food at the canteens. However, considering the record of the city's civic agencies in maintaining roads, schools, primary health centres and public lavatories, there are apprehensions over the levels of hygiene that will be maintained at these canteens. They will be called Saviruchi Sanchari canteens.
