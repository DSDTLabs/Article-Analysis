AHMEDABAD: The promoters of   (DPIL) —  , his brother Sumit and father   — were refused protection from arrest by a special   court here on Tuesday, in connection with charges of cheating, forgery and conspiracy to defraud 19 banks out of Rs 2,654 crore.

 Special judge N G   refused the   anticipatory bail in the alleged bank scam, observing that judicial notice can be taken of the fact that “day-in and dayout, scamsters of big economic offences leave the country and flee from justice”. This too is a big scam and the accused’s involvement, prima facie, is apparent, the court said.
 
 
 Upholding the CBI’s submissions, the court said that the investigation was under way. “A number of nationalized bank staff and public servants are probably also in collusion with the accused. There are a total of 19 banks connected to this scam. It is a probable that a number of bank officers are involved in committing the offence. Crores of rupees of public money is involved and it is necessary for the investigating officer to investigate and collect genuine information from bank officials as well as the accused.,” the court order reads.
 
 The court further said that anticipatory bail should be granted if accusations have been made with an ulterior motive with the objective of injuring or humiliating the accused.
 
 The court also said that the seriousness of the case and the conduct of the accused made custodial interrogation essential.
 
 The Bhatnagars argued that theirs was a case where loans were not repaid and didn’t involve cheating and forgery. The CBI maintained that the probe is at a nascent stage and the FIR was lodged on March 26 after verifying that irregularities and illegalities had taken place.
