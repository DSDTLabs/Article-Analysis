Panaji: Goa state pollution control board (GSPCB) has decided to give 19 mining leases the consent to operate, including seven out of the 13 mines in the Sonshi cluster.

 The board had a draft agenda to consider 45 applications of mining units in its 124th, 125th and 126th meetings and took the decision regarding 19 leases on Wednesday.
 
 For six leases granted consent in Sonshi, the board has recommended that the department of mines and geology effect a curb on the extraction capacity, sources said.
 
 Besides, the board has decided to issue six mining firms showcause notices for withdrawal of environment clearance (EC), as these had been obtained under the 1994 EIA notification with a relevant five-year expiry and had been extended later. 
 
 Most clearances were issued between the years 2005 and 2006. In September 2006, the 1994 EIA notification was replaced with a new notification, one without the five-year stipulation. 
 
 Mining activity in Sonshi had kicked up much dust and controversy with villagers complaining of severe air pollution. The situation aggravated after 45 villagers, who blocked mining transportation in protest of the bad air quality, were arrested by the police.
 
 The villagers had also complained of contamination of water sources in the village.
 
 GSPCB had conceded in an affidavit before the high court in July 2017 that half the ambient air quality monitoring (AAQM) stations indicated that the air pollution in Sonshi exceeds the permissible limit due to mining activity.
 
 The high court had taken suo motu cognisance of pollution in the area due to intensive mining. The decision to keep six leases pending and reduction in quantum of extraction to those granted consent to operate may provide some relief to Sonshi villagers.
 
 Out of 19 mining leases granted consent to operate, some have been directed to follow certain conditions of implementing short-term and long-term measures.
