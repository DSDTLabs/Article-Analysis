Vijayawada: One of the smallest babies in India to ever survive was finally home on Wednesday after a long treatment at hospital at the Rainbow Hospital in the city.

 The tiny miracle baby weighed just 450 grams when she was born prematurely after her mother Rama Sri Satya had labour pains on September 27. Now, she has a normal weight of 2,200 grams after a rigorous treatment.
 
 Dr Dinesh Chirla, hospital director, explaining the case, said that Rama Sri Satya who joined hospital on September 25, 2017 had delivered a baby two days later in her 24th week of pregnancy. A team of paediatricians and neonatal care staff treated the baby for almost five months. She is now being fed orally, he added. 
 
 The baby underwent treatment with funds from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund and Employees’ State Insurance Scheme along with special concessions, he said.
 
 Dr NS Vittal Rao, professor at Siddhartha Medical College in the city, says chances of survival of pre-term babies with less than 700 grams weight are very less and this is really an exceptional case. Technological advancements have helped doctors achieve this, he added.
 
 “We have successfully treated babies with the weight of 750 grams to 1,200 grams at the Vijayawada Government General Hospital”, said Dr NS Vittal Rao.
