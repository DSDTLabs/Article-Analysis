CHENNAI: It is not only the   that has put the brakes on official work in  . The 22-member syndicate, which is the approving body for all academic and  , is only half-full and does not have a   since August 2016. 

 Some of the key issues that have not been resolved due to this include providing provisional degree certificates to around 500 PhD students who have completed viva-voce, appointment of chairpersons to schools of learning, and approval of courses in affiliated colleges, say professors in the university. 
 
 MKU has been given the status of   (UPE) by   and a source said that funding worth crores under the scheme has been stuck waiting for syndicate approval. "Due to the absence of members, syndicate sub-committees could not be formed which can take care of these. MKU lacks academic leadership," a professor said. Former syndicate members say that the syndicate should meet at least once every three months. MKU has 77 departments, 20 schools, 21 academic centres and around 100 affiliated colleges and institutions whose functioning depends on the syndicate's working. More than 2,000 students and research scholars are on the university's rolls, according to its official website.
 
 Four syndicate members are elected by the senate, three by the academic council, and three are university professors from among the heads of the department, besides one reader nominated by the VC. All these posts are vacant.
 
 The university has not had a vice-chancellor since April 2015. The term of the last elected member of the syndicate got over in August last year. The remaining 11 members are government bureaucrats, governor nominees and one university representative.
 
 Syndicates are being kept unfilled since the government does not want to face uncomfortable questions raised in such bodies, said N Pasupathy, general secretary of Association of University Teachers.
