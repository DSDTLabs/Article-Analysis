VELLORE: A 37-year-old cameraman of a private TV channel was hacked to death in front of his house at Kosapettai here on Thursday night. 

 The   police officials arrested two marijuana peddlers in the case. The initial police inquiry revealed that the duo had murdered him mistaking him for being a police informer.
 
 The deceased was identified as Ashok Kumar, who worked for Imayam TV. Ashok is survived by his mother Kamala.
 
 As Ashok stayed near the Vellore South police station, he often used to go there for news, the police said.
 
 The police identified the accused assailants as Thirumalai, 35, and Ramesh alias  , 20. They were wanted by the police for their alleged involvement in various crimes, including a few murder cases. They were recently arrested in connection with a murder case but came out on bail. They suspected that they were trapped by the police based on a specific tip given by Ashok, and so decided to kill him. On Thursday, around 11:30pm the duo knocked at the door of Ashok. As the cameraman opened the door, they stabbed him repeatedly with a knife and fled. Ashok had serious injuries to his abdomen, chest and back. He was rushed to the Government Vellore Medical College and Hospital where he was declared "brought dead".
 
 Hours after the murder, local people demanded that the police curb rising drug related crimes. Locals, on condition of anonymity, said that despite numerous complaints of marijuana being sold at Thottapalayam , Kaagithapattarai, Saloonpettai and its vicinity, no action has been taken yet. This open sale of marijuana, apart from giving easy access to many school and college students, leads to a series of crimes in the area, locals said.
