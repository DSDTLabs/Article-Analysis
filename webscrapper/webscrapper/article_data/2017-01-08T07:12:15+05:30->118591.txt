NEW DELHI: Former finance minister   said on Saturday that the   released by the   ( ) had exposed the government’s claims.

 The CSO on Friday said GDP growth in 2016-17 is estimated to be 7.1%, slower than the previous year’s 7.6%. This is slowest pace of growth in three years. 
 
 The data does not take into account the impact of demonetisation and economists say growth could be lower due to the impact of the government’s move to scrap 500 and 1,000 rupee notes on November 8.
 
 “First the RBI, now CSO have forecast lower GDP growth. Govt’s claims and boasts exposed. Growth will be even lower because of demonetisation. 1% reduction means loss of Rs 1,50,000 crore,”   said on microblogging site Twitter.
 
 Several economists have pared their growth estimates for the current fiscal year to below 7% and the   (RBI) last month lowered its GDP growth estimates for 2016-17 to 7.1% from 7.6%. Officials expect the impact of the note ban to be temporary and have said that growth will rebound in the quarters ahead.
