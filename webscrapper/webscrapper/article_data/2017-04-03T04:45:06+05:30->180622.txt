Ghaziabad: Two days after a five-year-old-girl was raped and murdered in Indirapuram, Noida   met her family members on Sunday in Kanawani village and promised a speedy probe into the matter. 

 Singh has directed the police to arrest Afroz, who allegedly committed the crime and is absconding, as soon as possible. Singh said he has requested the CM to give a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the girl’s family. The family members of the girl, along with over 200 villagers, demanded the arrest of the accused. They also accused the police of concealing the girl’s body after it was discovered on Friday night, and not handing it over to the family members for the last rites, instead cremating it immediately after the postmortem. Speaking to TOI, the girl’s father said, “They did not let us bring the body home. The SP also tried hiding the matter from mediapersons. He said it was necessary as it could create communal tensions.” 
 
 Singh said, “I have spoken to CM   to approve a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the girl’s family. I have also told the Ghaziabad DM to help them in whatever way they want it.”
 
  “No arrests have been made yet. We are investigating the matter,”  , SP (city), told TOI.
