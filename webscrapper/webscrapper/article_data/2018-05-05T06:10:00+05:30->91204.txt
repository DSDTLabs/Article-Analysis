GHAZIABAD: Almost 66% of flats that had been delayed by developers have been either handed over to buyers in the past nine months or are ready for possession, the   has claimed.

 The   said it was because of its constant prodding that most of the builders have handed over flats to  . The development body has lodged police complaints against several builders who still haven’t given possession to buyers.
 
 “About nine months ago, when a three-member ministerial committee was set up to look into the builder-buyer impasse, there were close to 23,800 flats with 27 builders that were delayed. But as of now, over 15,790 units are ready, of which possession of 8,662 has been given,” said VK Singh, officer on special duty at the GDA. “As for the remaining units, we are keeping up the pressure and reviewing the projects. We hope the remaining units would be delivered soon,” he added.
 
 In January this year, the GDA had conducted a survey in which it was found that 12,035 flats were ready and buyers had moved in into 4,902 of them. “In the past three months, 3,760 units were handed over to the buyers, which was mainly because of our officials continuing to keep the pressure on the builders and prodding them to meet the deadline,” he said.
 
 Of 27 builders whose projects had been studied by the GDA, seven were found to have been lacking in building the flats, prompting the GDA and the buyers to jointly lodge FIRs against them.
 
 “Of the seven, the GDA has lodged FIRs against four builders, who are Manju J Homes, Mahagun Real Estate, SVP Builders and Friendland Developers,” said Singh. The remaining FIRs have been lodged by homebuyers against Value Infra, Ansal Properties and KDP Builders, among others.
