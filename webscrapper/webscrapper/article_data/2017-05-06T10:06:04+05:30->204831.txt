PATNA: The Bihar police’s   (SVU) on Friday raided the premises of DIG (prisons)   at three locations in Patna and unearthed his alleged disproportionate assets worth over Rs 1 crore.
 
  The raids were conducted at Dew Lush County Apartment in Friend’s Colony, Vrindavan Apartment on Ashiana-Digha Road and house number 4 at Jaiprakash Nagar after special vigilance court-I of judge Madhukar Kumar issued a search warrant on Friday.
  
  According to an FIR lodged by the SVU on Thursday, Priyadarshi joined the state government service as a superintendent of jail on June 14, 1993 after clearing the Bihar Public Service Commission examination. He was promoted to the position of DIG (prisons and correctional services) of the state home department in 2014.
  
  SVU sources said Priyadarshi earned Rs 68 lakh as salary since the date of joining. He should have a saving of one third of his salary, but he has amassed movable and immovable property worth Rs 1.2 crore in his and his wife Ruby Priyadarshi’s names. Ruby owns the two flats while the house is jointly owned by the couple, the sources said.
  
  These details have been revealed by the DIG in his Declaration of Assets and Liabilities. “We lodged the FIR after getting concrete evidence against the officer,” an SVU officer said, adding more skeletons were likely to tumble out during further SVU probe.
