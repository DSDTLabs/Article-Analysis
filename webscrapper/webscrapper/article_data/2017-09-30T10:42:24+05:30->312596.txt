COLVA: The   principal sessions court, on Friday, extended the interim bail granted to leader of opposition   ‘Babu’ Kavlekar till October 4 as police failed to file their reply in the case of   slips found at Kavlekar’s residence. 

 The police also failed to file a reply in Chandrakant’s brother Babal Kavlekar’s anticipatory bail application.
 
 Kavlekar’s advocate   said that the premises raided by the police belong to Chandrakant, but denied that his client had anything to do with the matka slips and other material found. Gomes said they could have been planted. 
 
 He argued that during the raid on Chandrakant’s residence in Betul, the raiding party had taken the keys to the room from   and had not returned them. The defence lawyer said that after the raid, the officials had not posted any guards at the three entry points and hence any person could have planted the gambling material.
