NEW DELHI: A day after a 35-year-old woman and her 15-year-old son were shot dead by her brother-in-law, Pramod Kumar, in southwest Delhi’s  , police said the victim’s two other kids saved themselves by running to their neighbour’s house.

 Initial probe indicated that Kumar entered the house near Ramphal Chowk at 8pm and was armed with a pistol. He found his 15-year-old nephew, Bobby, and shot him first.
 
 Meanwhile, the boy’s mother, Deepa, and her two kids — aged nine and six — had just reached the house when they heard a commotion and went in to check. Deepa asked her kids to wait outside. As she reached the staircase of the first floor, Pramod shot her in the head.
 
 Meanwhile, the two kids ran to their neighbour’s house. The accused fled from the scene after finding no one else in the house, investigating officers said.
 
 The accused’s brother, Praveen Kumar, said that the family was embroiled in a dispute with Pramod over their two-storey house in Palam. Praveen said that his brother was living with his wife and two kids in Tijara village in Rajasthan, while their father was living with them in Palam. Praveen worked as a driver but had recently lost his job.
 
 Sources said that Pramod wanted the ground floor of the house for his family, but Deepa had refused to give him the share. This led to frequent quarrels between the two.
