BATHINDA: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president   and Baghapurana MLA   Brar of the Congress traded barbs as Sukhbir called Brar a gangster and the latter shot back saying that the SAD chief wasn’t able to accept his party’s crushing defeat in the 2017 assembly elections.

 Sukhbir made these allegations while talking to newspersons after addressing a rally at Baghapurana town of Moga on Tuesday. He leveled these allegations in response to a question regarding action of the Congress government in eliminating gangsters. Sukhbir alleged the local MLA was a big gangster.
 
 Meanwhile, Brar said Sukhbir was frustrated as the SAD had to settle for the third place in the 2017 assembly polls. He said the Akali Dal was unable to make any of its party candidates file papers for the Baghapurana municipal council elections in December 2017.
