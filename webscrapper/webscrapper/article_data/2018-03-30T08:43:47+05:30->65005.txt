LUDHIANA: There are just two days to go for the launch of the E-Way bill system on April 1 but city businessmen are wary about the online system. Industrialists fear the online system might be plagued by technical glitches, the way it did on February 1, when it was first launched and crashed. After that, it had to be postponed for two months. Businessmen also feel the threshold limit of Rs 50,000 for mandatory compliance to the system is too low and needs to be revised. 

 Narinder Bhamra, president, Fasteners' Manufacturers Association Of India said the E-way bill system will turn out to be a big failure and will ruin businesses. "Such a complex system was not needed at all. But unfortunately, the government is going ahead without studying the ground realities. It is certain that this move will backfire as the online system is not capable of handling such a huge number of E-way bill requests.
 
 Jaswinder Thukral, president,   said, "Once again, the Centre government is forcibly imposing its decision on businessmen. Everyone knows the exemption limit of Rs 50,000 is so less according to current circumstances but the government has refused to budge from its stand. If they want to go ahead with e-way bill system, the Centre should fix an exemption limit of at least Rs 2 lakh."
