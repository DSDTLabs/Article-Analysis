AJMER: The Ajmer police on Wednesday solved the mystery of threat letter sent to state education and panchayat minister   over renaming   and arrested Sayed Ashar Abaas Kajmi.

 Kajmi, who is a resident of Ramganj, works as assistant accountant in panchayat training centre in Ajmer. Interestingly, he had typed the letter at the training centre itself in the name of his brother’s wife, Tarunam.
 
 Police arrested Kajmi on charges of extortion under Section 384 of IPC. They found that the motto of sending threat letter to minister Devnani under his brother’s wife’s name was to frame his brother and his wife as they are involved in a property dispute.
 
 SHO Kotwali police station   said that it has also come to light that Kajmi has previously also sent a letter to the private school, where Tarunam works as a librarian, stating that she should work in a school of her community. 
 
 “On the basis of mobile messages, recordings and other evidences, police reached Kajmi. During interrogation, Kajmi accepted sending threat letter to Devnani,” Meena said.
 
 Police added that the motive was to frame the family of his brother in crime and to get an edge in the property dispute. 
 
 The letter was posted on December 30, 2016 from   post office. It reached the office of Devnani in January, but remained there as Devnani was busy in different tours and was recovered in the month of February. Superintendent of police got the letter from Devnani and on March 3 Kotwali police initiated the investigation.
