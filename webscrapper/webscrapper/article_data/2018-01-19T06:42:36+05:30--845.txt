CHENNAI: Three days after   advocate-general   alleged that 'certain vested interests' were trying to derail election to   and Puducherry, two special committee members of the council have now alleged that it was the AG who was 'acting on his own and treating them as his subordinates.' 

 Senior advocate   and former CBI public prosecutor N Chandrasekharan, have said that   has issued various directions to the secretary of the council on his own, without their knowledge.
 
 Asserting that they are not acting as per the wishes of senior advocate S Prabakaran (nominee to the BCI from TN bar council) and that they never show any favouritism to him, the duo said, "We treat him only as a member of the BCI in New Delhi," adding they have no objection to conduct the elections in supervision of retired judges of the Madras high court.
