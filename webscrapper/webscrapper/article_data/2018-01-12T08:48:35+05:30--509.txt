CUTTACK: At least two   when an agitation of   workers outside the   (CMC) office on Thursday turned ugly. 

 Opposing lack of development, BJP workers tried to barge into the CMC office and clashed with police when the latter tried to stop them. 
 
 The agitating BJP workers allegedly hurled eggs, tomatoes and stones at the police personnel in which two of them were injured. Additional DCP Rajkishore Paikaray and another police personnel Bhujbal Majhi were injured in the incident. Their condition is stable now.
 
  A case has been registered and police have arrested one BJP worker for hurling stones at police. "Appropriate action will be taken against the culprits," said DCP Akhileswar Singh. 
 
 However, opposing the arrest of BJP worker, the saffron party workers on Thursday evening gheroaed the Purighat police station. The BJP leaders alleged that the BJD-ruled CMC council has not developed the city. "The roads are dilapidated and drains are overflowing. The ongoing sewerage overhauling work has made the lives of people miserable," alleged BJP leader  . The BJP leader also claimed that their men have not hurled stones at police. It is the work of some mischief mongers. 
 
 But BJD Cuttack-Barabati MLA Debasish Samantray termed BJP's protest as an act of hooliganism. "This is not the way to protest," said the MLA.
