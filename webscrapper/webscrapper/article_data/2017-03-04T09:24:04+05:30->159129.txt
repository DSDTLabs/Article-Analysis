CHENNAI:   hit Chennai with winds of unexpected strength when it made   last December, plunging entire localities in darkness, tearing up overhead cables and making people rush for shelter from its fury.

 When the storm died down, however, it was clear that it ravaged the city's trees more severely than anything else, uprooting or simply lopping off more than 30,000 trees within corporation limits.
 
 Naturalists then observed something else: trees of exotic provenance were the worst-hit; but many native species somehow withstood the  .
 
 A   (Ficus religiosa) -a fig species native to the subcontinent -fell in the cyclone at  . Forest officials, who were removing exotic trees that the storm felled within the park, realised that they could try to replant some of the native trees at the same spots they once stood. Range officer R Dhanasekaran said wildlife officials decided to replant the peepal tree likewise. The next step was to prune the tree's trunk.
 
 “The winds severed several branches on the top of the tree and this reduced the weight of the tree to a great extent,“ he said. “Its roots were intact.“
 
 Foresters used two earthmovers to replant the tree at its original site. “We dug up the soil and replanted the tree,“ Dhanasekaran said.“We completed the job on January 22.“ After replanting the peepal tree, the foresters covered its base with soil and began to water it regularly .
 
 By the last week of February , the officials observed fresh shoots all over the tree. The tree had endured the storm.
 
 The foresters replanted more than 25 trees but only the peepal survived.
