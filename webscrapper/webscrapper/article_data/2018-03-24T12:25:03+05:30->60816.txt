It has been more than three weeks since the no-new-release rule came into the place in Tamil film industry. The problem has become harder to ignore day by day and the latest has been JSK Sathish’s lament over special shooting of Vijay’s upcoming film ‘Thalapathy 62’.

 He was one of the first ones to speak out against the issue and even said that the senior actor like   should have considered doing better, for others tend to follow suit.
 
 Now, the producer who has done Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom, Idharkuthaanae Asaipattai Balakumara and Puriyatha Puthir with   has condemned the actor too. He has taken it to   saying, “Heard Vj Sethu’s   shoot is going on. What’s d council doing? If a spl permission letter is d only diff then I guess it won’t b a problem for others to get it & proceed with work. I strngly oppose dis on behalf of d producers who have obeyed all d rules & regulations properly. (sic)”
 
 As and when the news of Vijay Sethupathi’s film shooting at   and Georgia broke out yesterday, Sathish’s tweet immediately followed. Vijay Sethupathi was shooting for his upcoming ‘Junga’ despite the ongoing strike.
