PANAJI: Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Saturday opposed the decision of joint   regulatory commission ( ) to hike the power   from April 1, and said that till chief minister Manohar Parrikar is back in Goa, the government should keep this decision in abeyance. 

 Rane said that if this decision isn’t kept on hold, than he, along with around 10,000 people from Sattari will march to Panaji and hold a token candlelight vigil as a mark of protest.
 
 TOI had first reported that there would be a hike in the power tariff in Goa. 
 
 Rane said that he will ask his party to take up this issue with the Union ministers. 
 
 Rane told reporters that he will also write to the three-member cabinet advisory committee (CAC) to stop the implementation of JERC decision. 
 
 “I request the CAC to keep this decision in abeyance,” Rane said.
 
 He also said that it was not acceptable to increase the power tariff by 11 percent, and it would have to be in the range of around two to three percent.
 
 “I am a sitting member of the cabinet and strongly condemn the JERC, and the decision to increase the power tariff,” he said. He also said that he is not concerned about the industry if power is hiked, but domestic consumers and the middle-class should not face problems due to the power tariff hike.
 
 He also said that bureaucrats cannot run the state and they should work within their limits. “Everything that is recommended by the JERC, we should not accept,” he said.
