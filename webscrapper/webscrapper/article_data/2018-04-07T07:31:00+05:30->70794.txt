Manali: More than 500 workers under the Rohtang Tunnel Project, who have been on strike since March 27, have agreed to return to work after the intervention of Mandi constituency MP Ram Swaroop Sharma.

 “They have ended the strike and agreed to resume work. I have directed the project authorities to fulfil their demands at the earliest,” said Sharma, who met the workers and the project officials on Friday.
 
 The strike has adversely impacted progress of the 8.8km-long Rohtang tunnel in last 10 days. The project is already delayed by over three years. The workers were demanding to fall under labour law, even after working under a contractor. They were also demanding an upgradation in facilities like transportation, medical services, sitting, shift change and timing of meal.
 
 Although their demands were not completely met on Friday, the MP assured them that company would agree on all the legal demands.
