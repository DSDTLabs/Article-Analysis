CHENNAI:   chairman   is likely to replace   as the state   (CEO), sources in the Election Commission (EC) confirmed. 

 “We received three names. Of the three, we cleared Sahoo as the next chief electoral officer for  . The orders transferring   will be issued by the state chief secretary soon,” said a senior EC official in New Delhi. 
 
 Chief secretary   suggested a few names of senior IAS officers to the Chief Election Commission to replace Lakhoni. Besides Sahoo, BC, MBC & minorities welfare department secretary A Karthik was also in the race, sources said. 
 
 Sahoo, belonging to the 1997 batch, is a native of Odisha. He was appointed   chairman in September last year. The first test for the new CEO will be the Lok Sabha election scheduled for May next year. However, a Madras high court order in the case of 18 disqualified AIADMK MLAs and a floor test may end in an assembly election. 
 
 Rajesh Lakhoni took charge as CEO in November 2015. He oversaw the 2016 assembly election that AIADMK led by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa won. Lakhoni, who belongs to the 1992 batch, is a native of Madhya Pradesh, was Chennai corporation commissioner before he served as energy and agriculture secretary. He later took over as CEO replacing Sandeep Saxena who assumed charge as deputy election commissioner in the Election Commission.
