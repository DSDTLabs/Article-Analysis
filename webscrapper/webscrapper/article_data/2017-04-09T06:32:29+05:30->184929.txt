PUNE: After successfully completing  , Bombay   ( ) will hold the third common   for summer during April 9 and 16.

 A statement issued by BNHS said that the bird count will be conducted under the Common Bird Monitoring Programme. Bird watchers, nongovernmental organisations, ornithologists and nature lovers can participate in the count. These common bird counts are being conducted across three seasons on a pan-India level to scientifically monitor common birds and collect data about them.
 
 Grids measuring 2x2 km have been plotted using GIS to ensure scientific approach. The participants will be allotted grids after they send their location to BNHS. Participants will have to record birds in the data sheet provided by the society following the line transect method. The participants can choose any any day next week to conduct this count.
 
 The Common Bird Monitoring Programme (CBMP) is a citizen science programme with the objective of involving maximum number of people in observing birds in their backyard or places they visit regularly. There is a need to accurately monitor trends in common bird population which motivated the BNHS to design the CBMP. Common birds like house sparrows are facing numerous anthropogenic pressures in the form of developmental activities, thus making it necessary to monitor them to understand their current status.
