NAVI MUMBAI: Holi is not just the festival of colours in many north Indian homes, it’s also an occasion to indulge in a feast. The Holi lunch is has a variety of food preparations— from   to paneer and potatoes, the fare is sweet, spicy and high on flavours.

 The food is strictly vegetarian and, of course, seasonal. “Some homes restrict the lunch to snacks while others opt for a proper meal with main course and desserts,” said Sharda Bharadwaj, a resident of Sanpada. She generally prepares a lavish spread with a variety of pakoras, chaats and pani puri along with rajma, dal and kheer. “Everyone wants to sample a bit of everything, so I try to keep the fare varied,” she added.
 
 Some families opt for dinner, keeping in mind that people often play Holi till late afternoon. “Dinner is a better option as everyone is relaxed and can look forward to a hearty meal,” said Pinky Arora, a Vashi local. She usually cooks chole, aloo puri, parathas and moong dal halwa for dessert.
 
 Many also opt to serve a colourful spread using organic colours and flower petals for a grand effect. “Sometimes, we want a feast that has a lot of colour so we use seasonal vegetables. Kadai and tandoori paneer, ajwain parathas, phirni, paan gulkand, flavoured lassis and aam panna are some favourites,” explained Monisha Gupta, also from Vashi.
 
 For Gupta, the religious sentiment is as important as the food. “The fire we light on Holi is just as special and everyone is a part of it,” she added.
 
 However, Nerul resident Varsha Aluwalia said that her Holi lunch is a potluck—everyone brings in a dish, that way it is less burden for the host and the items are decided in advance earlier.
