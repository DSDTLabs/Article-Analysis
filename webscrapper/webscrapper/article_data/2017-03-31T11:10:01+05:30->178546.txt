The residents along with former   president Pankaj Sharma have urged the district administration not to set up liquor shops in the residential area.
 
 Banker Annu Pandey, a resident of Avanti Vihar said, "A liquor shop in a residential area has led to a rise in the incidents of eve-teasing. Also, brawls take place due to the movement of criminals in the area. We will continue our protest against opening of liquor outlet in our locality."
