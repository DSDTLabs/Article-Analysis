Are your walking shoes getting a little old and faded out? Don’t think of throwing them away like you usually might do. Instead, jazz them up with a few nifty ideas to make them look as good as new. These tips work wonders on an all-white pair as well…

 
 Athleisure is a big trend, which means you can wear your   just about anywhere. So, how about adding some studs or rhinestones to them? Simply choose the studs you like and push their end point through the canvas. Use pliers to fold and tighten the points. To add on pretty coloured stones, just use adhesive glue. 
 
 
 To do this, first spread fabric glue on the cleaned surface of the shoe. Place the fabric piece on it and press that down. Let it dry thoroughly. Once down, cut out the excess fabric on the sides. 
 
 
  
  
 Another great show   idea is to add some sparkle and shine through nail paint. Either spray on the paint or kick up some funky designs with your glittery nail polish. 
 
 
 
 How about some stylish chic with faux fur? Just sew it or glue it on the inside tongue or back rim of the shoe and you’re done!
 
 
 Sneakers can also get a fun look with buttons. Go with symmetrical designs or just sew or glue on odd designs for an edgy vibe.
