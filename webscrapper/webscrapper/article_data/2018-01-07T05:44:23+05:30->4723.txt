WASHINGTON: The US is developing risk communication plans to access landlocked  , which is currently dependent on Pakistan, a   official has said.The decision comes after relationship between the US and Pakistan nosedived as a result of   administrationâ€™s decision to suspend approximately $2 billion in security assistance as   was not willing to take decisive actions against terror groups operating from its territory.

 A senior Trump administration official has said the US is developing risk mitigation plan, given the past experience that Pakistan blocks ground lines of communication as retaliatory measure.
 
 The US is taking into consideration the access issue and other issues and that is why   is keeping its lines of communication open with Islamabad.
 
 Last week, the   said the US favours supply routes through Pakistan because of cost, but has built flexibility into its Afghan supply lines to avoid over-reliance on any single option. Currently, there are about 14,000 US forces in Afghanistan.
