 CHANDIGARH: The two-dustbin idea died in just four months. In June, the civic body started handing out separate containers for   and  . Families found these too small or inferior for trash cans but prefect buckets for mopping, carwash, and growing plants. Punjab governor and Chandigarh administrator VP Singh Badnore had kicked off the source-segregation campaign in the presence of the local MP and mayor at Tagore Theatre. The civic body had bought the pairs of green and blue bins for Rs 2 crores. It hoped that the households will segregate their wet and dry waste for easier processing but, instead, residents found novel uses for these bins.
 
 People complain that the bins don't have lids to cover the stink. Kavita Tekriwal of Sector 21 said: “I have put the blue and green bins to better use--for mopping floors and growing plants inside. For dumping garbage, I use the bigger bins I bought on the market.“ Simmi Sandhu of Sector 27 said: “Too small, these can't be full-time  . The civic body hasn't educated even its own   collectors, who still empty the dry and wet into one pile.“ Municipal councillor Ravinder Kaur, project's critic since Day One, uses the bins as mopping buckets. “The initiative cannot be a success unless the ground staff is trained to segregate the waste at the collection point.“
 
 Prem Singh of Sector 44 said: “The authorities must move towards smart investment.The trash bins provided to us show only a mindless action. For the success of the mission, the bins should be bigger, and the sanitation teams well-trained.“
 
 Sources in the civic body confirm that the MC had given a contract to private companies to distribute bins woth aboutb Rs 2.22 crore, and the claim to have given away more than 2 lakh bins, so far. Each pair cost the municipal corporation Rs 94.50.
