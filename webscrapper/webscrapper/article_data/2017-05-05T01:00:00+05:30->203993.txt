Amit Sadh, who will be seen in ' ', is passionate about travelling. His love for travel has led him on many exciting expeditions — from skiing on Gulmarg’s mountains to exploring the scenic Lahaul-Spiti valleys on a bike. Even before he became an actor, he would regularly go on   trips and has already traversed the length and breadth of India. Talking about his upcoming excursions, Amit says, “I’ll be scaling   in 2019. This year, I am doing a Manali-Leh   on a cycle and next year, I’m going on a 4,000 km bike ride to Kathmandu. During these trips, I’ll be living in tents, interacting with the locals and even cooking my own food — I won’t stay in hotels! It’s going to be very raw.” If all goes as planned, he even hopes to capture his experiences and make them into a travel web show.
