MADURAI: Villagers say that caste discrimination has been the norm for long in   where two dalits were hacked to death allegedly by upper castes. 

 
 As the dalits were blatantly exploited by the dominant castes, they had stopped working of late as farmhands on land owned by the   members in the neighbouring villages. With the help of educated youths they started increasing the cultivable land to be self-dependent, by augmenting the water resources.
 
 Shanmuganathan, one of the deceased, had completed MSc in agriculture. He refused to go for a job and started helping the villagers. He had recently sunk a couple of bore wells for farming.
 
 V  , 61, said, “Whenever the upper caste members enter the village, they expect us to stand and respect them. They would give an angry look if we do not respect them. However, some do not expect this. Issue crops up as the educated youths refuse to budge to the dominant caste members’ discrimination.”
 
 C   from the village said the youths from the dominant caste often harass ed   women when they went to take bath. “They used to abuse us using filthy language and cannot be questioned. They also attack our men, when they interfere, she said.
 
 “We stopped working in their farms as they give lesser wages for us compared to workers from their community. They also exploit us more and we should not raise any issue. The educated youths from our village asked us not to go to work on their farmland. This has irked them,” said G Valarmathi.
 
 Evidence, a Madurai-based NGO working for dalit rights, which conducted a field visit, has urged the government to release Rs 25 lakh as compensation for the victims’ familiesand Rs 5 lakh to the injured people. It has demanded the accused in the case be detained under Goondas Act and sought armed security for the villagers.
