The process of land acquisition for the   bullet train project on Monday hit a temporary roadblock in Vadodara. 

 National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) officials, who are implementing the project, had called for a second stakeholders consultation meet for the project. But the officials had to face angry protests from farmer representatives, who did not even allow officials of Delhi-based consultancy firm—Arcadis India Private Limited—to make a presentation.
 
 Ahead of Monday’s meeting, members of the   and Gujarat Khedut Samaj had already made a representation against the short notice period of one day which the NHSRCL had issued in a vernacular newspaper. “It is clear that the intent of the notice was not to publicize the public consultation for stakeholders properly but to merely dispense with a formality. In practical terms, the attempt was to ensure that the ‘notice’ is not noticed by stakeholders,” said  , an activist. “During the consultation meeting at Nadiad, the hearing was held in an unseemly haste with farmers not being given an proper opportunity to voice their concerns,” he said. 
 
 Retired government officers, who have been deputed at NHSRCL for land acquisition, escaped amidst the chaos. On official from the consultancy firm continued making efforts to placate the protesters. 
 
 “We have already held personal meetings with stakeholders in all the villages where the land is supposed to be acquired. Before four days of this meeting at Vadodara, we had intimated all the sarpanchs of the villages,” said D Dutta of Arcadis. 
 
 “We will organize meetings in other tehsils. If the protesters would have sat through the presentation, they would have got a lowdown on the compensation packages,” he added.
