NAGPUR: As the RBI has lifted limits on withdrawals from current  , sources in   say that the   has improved considerably now. The limits have been lifted entirely on current accounts. From an ATM one can withdraw Rs 24,000 in one go, if it is a savings account. However, this will also exhaust the weekly limit earlier set at Rs 24,000.

 This means even as the earlier limit of withdrawing Rs 10,000 from the ATMs has bee hiked to Rs 24,000 the amount will be included in the overall weekly limits for a savings account. So a person withdrawing Rs 24,000 from the ATM cannot take any more funds even over the counter or through the ATM for a week, said an RBI source.
 
 Meanwhile bank officials said there is enough cash to meet the demand on account of enhanced limits. A source in a leading PSU bank said further supplies are expected in this week. However, at the same time the RBI will have to begin clearing the banned notes now lying at the banks’ premises to create space for fresh notes.
 
 B C Bhartia the president of   (CAIT), an organization advocating cashless economy said the RBI has to ensure that there is enough cash before lifting the limits. “If the limits are hiked and there is no cash to match the demand then the liquidity crisis will continue in the market. Consumers may resort to higher withdrawals only to remain assured that they have enough cash,” said Bhartia.
 
 He said the government has already mentioned in the parliament that the liquidity crisis remain till April. Now the question is whether the move to lift the withdrawal limits will help if government itself admits that the liquidity crunch will continue till April.
 
 Meanwhile the bank unions which are planning a strike on February 7 are also demanding a probe against cash hauls in new currency at the time when banks were grappling for cash. The unions have also alleged of partial treatment by RBI to the banks for supplying notes during demonetization days.
