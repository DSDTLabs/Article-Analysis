International pop sensation   took   by storm last evening. His performance was enjoyed by all the Beliebers who religiously attended his concert, despite the heat and the expensive tickets.

 Now, after Justin’s extraordinary night in Mumbai, it’s time for the ‘Shape of you’ singer   to take down Mumbai. Yes! Ed Sheeran is all set to pay Mumbai a visit in November this year.
 
 The pop singer announced his tour dates yesterday and drove everyone crazy, stealing all the limelight from Justin Bieber. November 19th, 2017, Ed Sheeran will perform in Mumbai as apart of his World Tour, which will include venues like Singapore and Dubai as well.
 
 The singer whose ‘Thinking out loud’ made us sway gazillion times, will be busy touring in America until the end of September, and as soon as he wraps things up there, his Asia visit will commence.
 
 The ticket costs, venue and other relevant announcements are yet to happen. It is certainly hoped that unlike Justin Bieber’s concert, this won’t have lip-syncs and mismanagements that disappointed the fans. 
 
 If you thought that ‘Shape of you’ and ‘Thinking out loud’ are the only two songs that have made Ed Sheeran popular, wait until you listen to some of his other hits. We are giving you two of our favourites!
