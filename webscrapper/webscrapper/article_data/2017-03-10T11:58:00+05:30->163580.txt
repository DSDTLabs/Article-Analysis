AHMEDABAD: Vishwa Jain, 16, based in  , is refreshingly honest and hard-working. A cancer survivor, she was allotted a writer for   but the gutsy girl has declined saying she is strong enough to write her exams, and she just needs half an hour extra since she is not able to sit for long due to extreme weakness. 

 Vishwa’s honesty overwhelmed   officials who have witnessed `fake fracture' scams where healthy students sought writers by falsely bandaging their hands.
 
 “I want to write my own exams. I want to do well in exams. I wish to become a doctor-- a cancer specialist and research for a treatment which is not long and painful,” said Vishwa sounding full of confidence. “I have personally suffered the excruciating treatment and am committed to discover a drug which will spare children battling cancer,” Vishwa added.
 
 State board vice-chairman R R Thakkar said that Vishwa has been granted half an hour extra as she will need to take rest in between exams. “She is a special kid and we have extended all possible support on compassionate grounds,” said Thakkar.
 
 Vishwa was diagnosed with   in 2010 when she was in class V. “She used to have fever and feel extremely weak. When her condition worsened and her blood count fell drastically, her bone marrow tests were conducted and she was diagnosed with blood cancer,” says Vishwa's mother Parisha who works as a professor in BEd college in Jamnagar. 
 
 It took years of treatment which included chemotherapy and painful injections in her lower spine to prevent the cancer from spreading to her brain. She is currently cancer free, but the disease has left her extremely weak and depleted of crucial vitamins and minerals.
 
 “I study for four hours and then take a break. I listen to music and also read books when I like to unwind. Then I study again. I don't stress over exams but regular studies and coaching has left me very determined,” Vishwa said beaming with positivity.
