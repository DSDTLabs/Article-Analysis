Manali: Five youths from Delhi, including two girls, who lost their way in the dense forest while returning to Mandi after visiting the Parashar lake were rescued by the police on late Thursday evening. 

 Mandi police launched a hunt for the missing youths after receiving a distress call from a mobile number at 3.30pm on Thursday. “A person by the name Abhinav called up police, saying he was from Delhi and stuck in jungle with his friends. He said all of them were extremely nervous and terrified as mobile connectivity in the area was weak and there were wild animals around. A police team from Padhar with a DSP and an SHO, and a quick response team rushed to the spot to search for them,” said Mandi superintendent of police Prem Kumar Thakur.
 
 The region has many leopards and bears which have been sighted by the locals many a times, the officer added. The youths were unable to tell police their exact whereabouts. According to Thakur, the rescue team, which was on the job immediately, used to google to trace the cellphone used to make the call. “We found their location in no time and all the stranded and lost youths were rescused within hours,” added Thakur.
