NEW DELHI: Incumbent   chief minister   announced on Monday evening that he would resign from the chief ministerial position shortly.

 "I will tender my resignation (from position of CM) in a short period of time, either today or tomorrow," he told news agency ANI. 
 
 Ibobi Singh, however, has been arguing that with the Congress emerging as the single largest party, he should be given the first opportunity to form the government.
 
 "I am ready for a floor test and I have the numbers with me," said Singh. 
 
 Earlier, Manipur Governor   had asked Congress's Ibobi Singh to submit his resignation immediately, so that the process of formation of the next government can be started.
 
 The Governor said that it was her duty to cross-check the claims and that she would not accept an ordinary piece of paper as a "letter of support" unless she meets the NPP MLAs, the source said.
 
 The BJP leadership with their 21 MLAs, along with NPP president and four party MLAs, one Congress MLA, lone LJP and TMC MLAs had also met the Governor.
 
 The BJP had claimed that it enjoyed the support of 32 MLAs in the 60-member assembly.
 
 They also submitted a letter from the Naga People's Front (NPF) president regarding their support to the BJP to form the government, the source said, adding that the Governor is yet to invite any party for government formation.
 
 The Congress had won 28 seats in Manipur, followed by the BJP 21. The NPP and the NPF have won four seats each, while the LJP and the   have bagged one seat each.
