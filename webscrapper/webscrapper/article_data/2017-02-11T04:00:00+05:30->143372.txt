Chennai: Adiuvo diagnostics, a medical diagnostic device company, has raised funding from social enterprise incubator Villgro. A total sum of Rs 65 lakh would be invested on the startup on a milestone basis. The firm had earlier received a grant of Rs 50 lakh from Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council, Government of India.

 Adiuvo has developed a portable, non-invasive device that helps in the diagnosis of skin and soft tissue infections, which will aid the doctors with right treatment decisions and for optimising wound management. “Only 6000 dermatologists in India cater to our 121 crore population. Due to the lack of a device/method to quickly identify and differentiate the pathogen causing the infection at an early stage, generic antibiotics are prescribed which contribute to antibiotic resistance, rise of super bugs and other infections,” said founder R Geethanjali. The startup would utilise the fund for adding manpower, procuring components for manufacturing the devices.
 
 Speaking on the investment, Arun Venkatesan, CTO, Villgro, said, “In India’s public-health context, making rapid, diagnostic capabilities available at points of screening, enables the front-line physicians to make decisions rapidly and ensures effective treatment. Adiuvo’s technology aims to do this at a reasonable cost and with ease-of-use in mind.”
