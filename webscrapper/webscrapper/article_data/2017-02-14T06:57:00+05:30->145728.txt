GHAZIABAD: The pole of a signage board at   intersection on   has been a cause for concern for commuters and residents of the area. The pole of the signage board is located in the middle of the road which turns towards Indirapuram and continues as Kala Patthar Road.

 Local residents said the pole was a major cause for concern, especially for night commuters, and those who are not aware of its presence. “I was taking the turn while returning from office last Monday, and had a close shave as I could not see the pillar because of the glare from the lights of an auto coming from the wrong side of the road,” said Rohan, a resident of Vaishali.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Rakesh Kumar, a resident of Amrapali Village, a residential society located near the intersection, said the pillar invited a lot of trouble for commuters. “Local residents of the area have already become used to the location of the pillar and manage to avoid it. Even I had a problem with it earlier. But it is a major threat for new commuters,” Kumar said. Residents also pointed out that in the event of a traffic jam, the pillar causes restrictions to traffic coming from NH-24 .
 
 When asked about when and how the issue would be resolved, Chakresh Jain, executive engineer of GDA, denied knowledge of the problem. He said, “Which pole are you talking about? I have never heard of any such pole and or whether any commuters are affected by it. Why is it suddenly a problem for people when there has been no complaint in that regard so far?”
