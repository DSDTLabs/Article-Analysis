PANAJI: Aghast after   quit the Congress on the first day of the   and seeing its numbers in the 40-member legislative assembly reduce to 16 within days of the declaration of results, the Congress on Thursday declared Rane a persona non grata.

 Though the party has initiated moves to disqualify Rane, the move is redundant as Rane has submitted his resignation to the protem speaker of assembly, Sidharth Kuncalienker. Rane submitted his resignation at around 3 pm, hours after he took oath in the state assembly.
 
 “Till Thursday morning, he was fine. This is a jolt, but then junior Rane has always been like this – blow hot, blow cold. Goa’s politics is highly personalized with vested interests. It would be absolutely wrong to say, as Vishwajit said, that we did not agree to   as CM,” AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh said.
 
 Congress state unit issued a formal statement later in the evening, stating that Vishwajit had defied the party and betrayed party workers. “It has created a huge abyss between the party and Rane. This is an insult to the electorate and the party condemns the behaviour. I am sure we will overcome this,” former Union law minister   said.
