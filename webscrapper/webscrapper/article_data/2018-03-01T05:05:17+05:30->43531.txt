GREATER NOIDA: Commuters breaking the speed limit along the 165km-long stretch of Yamuna expressway will no longer get away scot-free. The concessionaire of the expressway has been directed by   to integrate a traffic violation   system, which will issue a traffic violation detail included in the toll fee slip. 
 
 In case a commuter violates a traffic rule, the violation slip will be handed over to her/him at the next toll plaza before he exits the expressway. 
  
  The expressway sees nearly 4,500 violations daily. Most of these challans remain pending as the traffic police are unable to get them received by the offender. 
  
 According to officials, about 4 lakh challans are pending till date and are yet to be served to errant motorists. The latest move comes following a meeting convened by Yeida CEO Arun Vir Singh, SP (traffic) AK Jha and concessionaire of expressway Jaypee group on Wednesday. 
  
 According to Yeida officials, the system will be implemented with effect from March 10, 2018. “We have directed the concessionaire to have the system in place by the stipulated time,” Singh told TOI. “The aim is to enforce traffic norms and deter commuters from speeding. Inability to serve the challans has led to a lack of enforcement by the traffic police,” he explained. “The aim is to deter speeding by motorists and thereby to lessen the accidents on the high-speed stretch,” he added. 
  
 Officials of the concessionaire said they will comply with the directions of YEIDA. “We hope motorists will comply with the traffic norms and drive according to speed limits,” an official said. “We see daily violations of speed limits totalling about 4,500. Details of these are shared with respective state RTOs every day. We hope the new integrated system will help us in further deterring speeding,” he added.
