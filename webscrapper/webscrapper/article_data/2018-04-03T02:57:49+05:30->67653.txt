MUMBAI: Another witness in the   alleged fake encounter trial was declared hostile after he did not support the prosecution's case on Monday.

 This is the 45th witness, out of the 63 who have deposed so far, to turn hostile in the 2005 case. The prosecution said that the witness, a school teacher from Sangli, had helped translate four statements of witnesses from Gujarati to Marathi in 2010.
 
 The statements, according to the prosecution, were those of a family who were travelling in the same bus from which Shaikh, his wife   and one other ( ) were abducted in 2005. The witness, however, said he was given only documents to translate. He further denied knowing the contents of the statements.
