Vadodara/Anand: Professor Tushaar Shah, senior fellow of the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), has been appointed as interim chairman of the Institute of Rural Management, Anand (IRMA). 

 Shah, who is also member of IRMA’s Board of Governors, was appointed as interim chairman after T Nanda Kumar resigned from the post mid-way of his tenure of three years citing personal reasons. Nanda Kumar had submitted his resignation during the board meeting of IRMA held on Friday. 
 
 The board had accepted his resignation and Shah was asked to take over. IWMI is headquartered in Colombo, Sri Lanka, but Shah is based in Anand.
 
 A three-member search committee has also been formed to suggest names for the new IRMA chairman. Based on the committee’s recommendations, the board will take a final call on the person who will be appointed as next chairman. IRMA was founded by Father of India’s White Revolution late Dr Verghese Kurien. 
 
 It is worth mentioning here that the institute is presently being managed by in-charge director Dr Rakesh Saxena after IRMA’s board of governors asked Dr R C Natarajan, who was facing sexual harassment charges levelled against him by a female employee, to proceed on leave. 
 
 The board had earlier last month asked Natarajan to proceed on leave till the local complaints committee (LCC) of Anand submits its report or till 100 days whichever is earlier and also gave extension to the female employee, who had registered the complaint against him.
