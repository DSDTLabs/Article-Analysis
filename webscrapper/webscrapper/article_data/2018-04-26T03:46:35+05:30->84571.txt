GURUGRAM: Residents of   have expressed concerns about the deteriorating   infrastructure in the area. Water supply is frequently affected owing to poor condition of the motor that pumps water to houses, they said. 

 Around 10,000 residents were affected after supply stopped on Tuesday and Wednesday, residents said. Around 1,050 families in sectors 3 and 6 were also affected, they told TOI.
 
 Residents blamed   for refusing to replace the lines, panels and motor pumps in the area. 
 
 “This is not the first time we have suffered immensely on account of the water shortage,” said  , president of Sector 5 RWA. “When we investigated the pipes, it turned out that a 60-horsepower motor had conked out. This is not the first time the motor has failed. MCG officials merely fix it temporarily,” he said.
 
 Despite several attempts by TOI, MCG junior engineer  , who is in charge of the area, couldn’t be reached.
