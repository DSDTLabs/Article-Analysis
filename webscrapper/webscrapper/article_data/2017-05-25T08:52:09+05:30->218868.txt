 The police have arrested Rajagopal, 32, from the same village for the murder. 
 
 P Dhanapappu, 55, and her son P Sathiyamoorthy, 31, from Venkatachalapuram village near Kallakudi, were found dead in front of their house by neighbours in the early hours of Wednesday. 
 
 Investigation by police revealed that R Rajagopal, Dhanapappu’s nephew, was responsible for the murder. Rajagopal came to Dhanapappu’s house at 3 am on Wednesday on his tractor and broke into the house. 
 
 He hacked Dhanapappu and Sathiyamoorthy to death with a sickle when they were fast asleep. He then laid the dead bodies on a mat and dragged them outside the house. 
 
 Rajagopal drove the tractor over the bodies to show as it was an accident. Leaving the tractor behind, he left the scene. 
 
 The police said that Rajagopal, nephew of Dhanapappu, had a dispute with her over some money transaction. His father Ramasamy, former panchayat president of the village, had borrowed Rs1 lakh from Dhanappapu for election expenditure three years back. 
 
 Ramasamy had passed away a couple of years back. Dhanapappu had asked Rajagopal for repaying the money that his father had borrowed. 
 
 However, Rajagopal allegedly washed his hands off the issue saying that he could not repay the loan that she had given his father. 
 
 Sathiyamoorthy, who was working as a teacher in a private school in Erode, also insisted Rajagopal to repay the loan. 
 
 The pressure from the mother-son duo angered Rajagopal who finally decided to finish them off and committed the murder. 
 
 The police said that they arrested Rajagopal within a few hours after the murder. The bodies were sent for
