AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of   recently issued notices to the Centre, state government and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), following a petition challenging the Central government’s move to introduce New   ( ) by enacting the PFRDA Act 2013.

 Under the new scheme, the contribution of subscribers i.e. employees of both central and state governments, including corporate employees is invested through Pension Fund Managers (PFMs) and these PFMs are public sector and private sector companies.
 
  and three permanent employees of the state’s health department working at Beed approached the   — through lawyer   — challenging the NPS, dubbing it as arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
 
 The petition said under the NPS, the contribution of government employees is invested through three government companies, whereas the private sector employees have a choice of investment through private sector companies. The petitioners argued that such dispensation and restriction disallows them to tap the expertise of private sector fund managers.
 
 “The different investment guidelines and discrimination and classification between subscribers from private sector employees and government employees is not found on intelligible differentia and the classification has no rational relationship with the object sought to be achieved by PFRDA Act and thus violative of Artice 14 of the constitution,” the petition said.
 
 It said “as the risk in the NPS is borne by the employee, the choice of PFMs shall be conscious decision of the employee and based on his perception of the pension fund, rather than a mandate by the employer”.
 
 Following arguments, the division bench comprising justices VM Kanade and Sangitrao Patil on January 20 issued notices to the Union and state governments along with the PFRDA, returnable on February 17. SB Deshpande, assistant solicitor general, appeared for the central government.
