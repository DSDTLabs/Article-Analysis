JAIPUR: The strike by drivers of app-based cab aggregators   and Uber entered fourth day on Wednesday with no signs of a truce emerging. Meanwhile, the commuters who have got used to the app-based cabs for the ease and comfort of booking and travelling are now having a hard time in bargaining with unyielding autowallahs who are out to take as much benefit of the logjam as possible. 

 The drivers under the umbrella of   (Jaipur) are demanding reduction in company commission from 25% to 10% (including 5% GST), taking back of blacklisted drivers, not giving permission to more cabs, increasing accident insurance and limiting driving period to nine hours per day, among others.
 
 TOI spoke to officials in both Uber and Ola, and also the top office bearers of the association and found that both sides are yet to sit across the table and find an amicable solution.
 
 "We had gone to meet officials in the local offices Ola and Uber here in Jaipur. But no meeting has been held. The officials are not meeting us. We have also written to the transport department. We will continue our protest till our demands are met," said  , president of the sangathan. While sources in Uber said that there are no Uber-owned leased vehicles in Jaipur, Ola has financed a few cabs as part of its initiatives to help people create their own business.
