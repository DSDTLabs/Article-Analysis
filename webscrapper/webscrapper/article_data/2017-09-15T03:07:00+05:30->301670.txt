Nagpur: Students of various colleges showcased their talent at a Vidarbha-level Open Vocal Classical Music Contest at LAD College on Thursday. The competition was organized by LAD and SRP College in memory of K Chitnavis to promote classical music among youngsters. Total 16 students from different colleges participated.

 The event started with a soothing performance based on raag Multani by Radha Jhengadi of LAD College. Many singers presented raagas like Bihag, Malkauns, Miya Malhar and others. 
 
 The singers were accompanied by Suresh Khardenvis on tabla and Vivek Sangit on harmonium. The singers blended their voice smoothly with music and got applause from the audience.
 
 Aman Ghormade, of SB Jain, bagged the first prize for an energetic performance of raag Bhupeshwari. 
 
 Sharda Deshpande and Devika Nayar stood second and third by presenting raag Ahir Bhairav and Malkauns respectively. The top three winners were awarded with cash prizes of Rs 1,500, Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,000 respectively.
 
 Shamla Rekhade and Sanika Ruikar were the judges. The singers were evaluated on points like presentation, voice and vocal expertise.
 
 Vaikhari Wazalwar, head of the department of music at LAD College said, “Classical music is fading nowadays. We wanted to bring youth closer to classical music.” 
 
 Ghormade said, “I belong to a family where no one even had heard about classical music. I was inspired by Arti Anklikar in my young age. I am receiving training under Subhash Kashalkar and attribute my success to him. The standard is improving, but more such competitions should be held in the city.” 
 
 LAD College vice-principal Radhika Elkawar was also present.
