Porvorim: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar on Friday said that the government has decided to withdraw its circular to Goa University permitting the varsity certain relaxations in appointment of faculty posts.

 The relaxation was given in terms of eligibility criteria, with regards to ‘domicile and language’, which Parrikar said was “misinterpreted by Goa University”.
 
 “I have asked the director of higher education to withdraw both provisions,” Parrikar said, while responding to the matter raised by Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco. 
 
 As many as 35 posts for professors, associate professors, assistant professors were announced by the university without specifying essential conditions, especially ‘domicile certificate and knowledge of Konkani’, which are mandatory for recruitment to government posts in the state. Lourenco said that Goans were likely to miss out on these jobs and urged the government to intervene.
 
 Parrikar said a fresh direction has been issued asking Goa University to seek permission from the government on case-to-case basis with proper justification if it wants to fill posts.
