   and wife   Mehra barely get any time to spend with each other, because of their shoots and distant shoot locations.
 
  The couple, who has always demonstrated their PDA for each other, has found a new way to love each other even if they are not together. Sargun, who had earlier left her home in Mumbai for London, where she had to shoot for her Punjabi film Jindua is once again far from home. This time she is in Punjab for her next film Lahoriye.
  
  
 
  
    and Sargun are showcasing their emotions for each other through facetime now. The Jamai Raja fame actor shared a picture of Sargun sending him a kiss across through facetime on Twitter and wrote, "This is how we meet these days."
  
  
  
  Sargun was unable to spend this New Years with her husband, instead ringed in 2017 in Punjab while shooting for her Punjabi film.
  
  She has become a popular face in the Punjabi film industry.
