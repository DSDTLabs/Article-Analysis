The exit polls indicate that the state once again is bucking the national trend of giving a clear mandate, and strengthening the early argument of this election being “issueless”.

 
 While poll pundits are guessing which way the JD(S) will go in the event of a hung assembly, state party chief   was confident he’ll be forming the government. “Do you have any doubts I am going to form the government?’’ he told the media after casting his vote in Ramanagara.
 
 The exit polls, if proved right, will be a big blow for chief minister  , whose high point in his campaigns was talking about occupying the post a second term. The  , stopping short of naming him the chief ministerial candidate, had announced he was leading the party in the polls.
 
 A hung assembly and the Congress not able to form the government will also mean the party losing  , the last bastion it held with PM Modi’s words that it will be reduced to Punjab, Puducherry and Parivar coming true.
 
 The exit polls also dashed the hopes of BJP’s chief ministerial candidate   who had also announced May 17 the date of his coronation as the CM. When asked about Yeddyurappa’s hopes of becoming the CM, an irate Siddaramaiah said: “He is mentally disturbed.’’ All exit polls have given single digits for independents winning. Karnataka has a tradition of seeing at least a dozen independents, who have played a crucial role in propping up parties to form the government when they fell short of numbers or got into a political crisis during the tenure. The majority of these independents happened to be rebels of principal parties.
