LUCKNOW: One of Lucknow Municipal Corporation’s biggest failures is its inability to remove encroachments permanently.

 Despite repeated drives in  , Munshipulia, Aurobindo Park and Aminabad, among others, encroachments reappear. While encroachments by street vendors and shopkeepers pose major obstruction to traffic, they also result in littering. Haphazard parking because of them is also a big menace.
 
  conduct regular drives, but till date, no encroachment has gone permanently. While LMC claims it is because of lack of support from police, locals feel it is due to lack of political will and poor coordination between government departments such as LMC, LDA and police.
 
 A big solution would have been faster implementation of the street vending policy to allocate fixed vending points and restrict vendors from other areas but LMC has still not implemented the policy. As a result, vendors flank all busy stretches.
 
 In Bhootnath and Aminabad, LMC had reserved places for vendors with yellow boundaries but implementation is absent.
 
 An official said, “After LMC clears encroachments, it is the police’s job to check them from resurfacing. But each time, they return within hours.”
 
 According to   of Indiranagar, LMC, police and district administration are equally responsible for the menace. “They always pass on responsibility to one another. If they charge heavy penalties and lodge FIR against repeat offenders, no one can dare encroach again.”
 
 Some feel the lack of political will is the biggest cause as VVIP areas are always free of such problems.
 
 Neelam, a resident of Vikasnagar, said, “A few days ahead of Investors’ Summit, all major roads were permanently cleared of encroachments and garbage. How come they were able to impose rules then but fail to bring the same dedication now?”
