MYSURU: Saturday’s wildfire in   that claimed the life of a forest guard has instilled a sense of fear among ground-level forest staff and villagers who are roped in on contract to attend to fire emergencies during the dry season.

 Hundreds of villagers and tribals living on the fringes of the forest are hired on contract for two-three months till the first showers to assist forest officials in tackling wildfire. Forest guard Murugappa was killed fighting wildfire in the park on Saturday.
 
 On condition of anonymity, the staffers and villagers on contract claimed that the only way to douse wildfire is through beating the flames with shrubs, for which they need to go close to the fire. Since it is difficult to assess the raging fire, they end up risking their lives.
 
 Forest officials, meanwhile, admitted that it’s is only way to contain flames because most of the forest areas are inaccessible by roads and hence fire engines can’t be rushed. Guards, watchers and range officers have to reach the spot on foot, which puts them at high risk of getting dehydrated in the heat.
 
 Range forest officers’ association vice president Ravindra, an RFO, told TOI : “We will meet forest minister Ramanath Rai on Tuesday during his visit to Mysuru to apprise him of the issues concerning watchers, guards and rangers. He said the minister is expected to visit Apollo Hospital where   and two watchers Manu and Manju are undergoing treatment for burns.
 
 Bandipur National Park director T Heeralal said: “After Saturday’s fire we have asked the ground level staff to take necessary precautions. We have also stationed fire engines at vulnerable points.”
 
 “We have created watch towers to identify even small flames from a distance,” he said. The park director claimed there hasn’t been any fresh fire after Saturday.
