AMRITSAR: On a mission to rejuvenate India’s rivers, spiritual leader Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, accompanied by Punjab governor V P Singh Badnore, paid obeisance at the   on late Friday evening. Jaggi, who is leading the ‘Rally for Rivers’ campaign, was received by SGPC senior vice-president Baldev Singh Kiampuri, general secretary Amarjit Singh Chawla, member Kiranjot Kaur and others.

 The spiritual leader took the parkarma (circumambulation) and showed keen interest in knowing historical aspects of various other Sikh religious places. He also offered ‘karah parshad’ and listened to ‘kirtan’ (hymns). Both governor Badnore and Jaggi were presented with a model of the Golden Temple and a set of Sikh religious books.
 
 As part of his campaign, Sadhguru Jaggi is driving from Kanyakumari to the Himalayas to create awareness about the rivers. During 30 days, he would traverse around 7,000km spanning 16 states.
 
 On the occasion, Sadhguru Jaggi said   was a source of spiritual peace for humanity and one received inner peace visiting the place.
 
 While stressing on tree plantation, he said tree roots make spoil porous so it absorbs rain water and holds it. Since India’s rivers are mainly rain fed, water trapped in the soil through trees, releases into the rivers gradually, he said, adding, “Trees are important in ensuring that perennial rivers flow even when the rains end.”
 
 He said perennial rivers are either becoming seasonal or going dry and the situation is grim but with a comprehensive policy and resolute government action, rivers can be nurtured and protected for future generations as well.
 
 Meanwhile, noted environmentalist   also organized a rally to create awareness about protecting the environment.
