HYDERABAD: A roti-maker allegedly attempted to kill his wife by setting her ablaze at Golconda on Sunday night. The victim survived the bid, but suffered 80% burns and is battling for life at Osmania Hospital. In her dying declaration, she told a magistrate her husband set her ablaze.

 Golconda police said  , 42, a housewife, is now battling for life with 80% burns at Osmania General Hospital (OGH). Around 10pm on Sunday night, Tahaseen Begum’s husband Sarvar told her to purchase watermelon. The victim replied that it was late in the night and the fruit might not be available. She refused to step out of their residence near Area Hospital, Golconda.
 
 “Sarvar became furious and picked up an argument with Tahaseen Begum. As per the statement given by the victim, Sarvar doused her with kerosene and set her ablaze. Other family members were not present at home when the incident happened,’’ assistant commissioner of police   told TOI.
 
 Police said Sarvar, who too suffered nearly 10% burns, denied attempting to kill his wife and claimed it was a suicide bid. The couple’s son, during investigation, gave a statement in support of his mother. Sarvar was allegedly under the influence of alcohol. Police registered a case under Sec 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC. Since she suffered severe burns, her dying declaration was recorded by the magistrate.
