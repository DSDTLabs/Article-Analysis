RAJKOT: Harsukh Patel, brother-in-law of the 12-year-old orphan boy Gopal Ajani, who was murdered in a conspiracy hatched by a London-based NRI woman and two others for insurance money, died at a hospital in Rajkot on Friday late night. Patel is survived by wife and a son.

 Gopal and Harsukh Patel (husband of Gopal’s elder sister) were stabbed by two unidentified persons when they were returning to hometown Keshod from Rajkot after completing visa formalities on February 8. The minor boy had succumbed to injuries on February 11. 
 
 The investigation into the murders has been handed over to the Junagadh local crime branch. The accused in the case include London-based NRI woman Aarti Dhir (53) and Nitish Mund (27), both natives of Gurdaspur in Punjab and  , a resident of Keshod. 
 
 The conspiracy behind Gopal’s murder came to light after the arrest of Nitish by Keshod police. Nitish and Raizada were studying together in London and were room partners there. Aarti was their neighbour and works at a local watch showroom. The trio had been hatching this conspiracy since 2015 when they met in London.
 
 On Saturday, Patel’s family members demanded that Kanwaljit Raizada’s father,   should also be made accused in the double murder case as he was also part of the conspiracy. Mahendra Raizada works as manager at a district cooperative bank in Maliay-Hatina village. 
 
 Initially, Patel’s family members refused to take possession of his body and demanded that the accused in London be arrested first. However, they accepted the body after police assured them of taking action.
