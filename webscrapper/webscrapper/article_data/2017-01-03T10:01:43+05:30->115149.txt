JAIPUR: It appears that   is not serious on the ill-effects of all kinds of manjhas ahead of   -   Though they have issued orders to ban all kinds of manjhas, it is selling like hotcakes in the Walled City markets in the absence of punitive action. 

 TOI visited the Walled City markets, including Handipura, Ramganj, Choti Chaupar, Chandpole and others, which have wholesale market of kites and manjhas and found traders have no scare of the ban imposed by the Jaipur police. 
 
 All the four DCPs of east, west, north and south districts of Jaipur police had ordered to ban metallic and glass-made manjhas which does not give any further scope to sell manjhas, still it is been sold in almost every market of Jaipur. 
 
 It may be recalled that in December last year, the   had imposed an interim nationwide ban on use of glass-coated 'manja' for flying kites as the sharp string poses a danger to humans, animals and birds. A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Swatanter Kumar passed the order after noting that 'manja', string coated with glass and metal powder and used for flying kites, poses a threat to the environment.
 
 "As the festival fever is catching up the campaign against manjhas is going to get intensified where we will introduce lot of seizures from the shop selling manjahs," said Prafful Kumar, additional deputy commissioner of police(Crime), Jaipur police. 
 
 However, at some of the shops in Handipura the traders are looking little confused as well as scared. "The kite lovers can't expect flying kites without manjhas. I think metallic   is more dangerous than the glass coated manjha. The administration must re-think on their decision to ban manjha," said Mustaq Ahamed, a wholesale trader of manjha from Bareilly Uttar Pradesh who was seen at Handipura with his bunch of kites and manjhas. 
 
 In Jaipur, the fatal Manjha had taken the toll of kids and many people get injured and witness various kinds of injuries.
