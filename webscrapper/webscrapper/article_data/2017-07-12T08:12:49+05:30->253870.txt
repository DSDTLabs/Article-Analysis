Over 9 lakh state employees and 6 lakh pensioners will get cashless   for incurable diseases as Yogi government made budgetary provision of Rs 150 crore for the same on Tuesday.

 Beneficiaries will be able to avail of the benefit anywhere in India, though upper limit for individuals has yet to be finalised. Sources said the scheme may also be extended to family members of the employees and pensioners. “This is the only relief to state employees who were waiting for some announcement in keeping with recommendations of the seventh pay commission,” said a Vidhan Sabha employee. 
 
  infrastructure got a shot in the arm with sanctions to open new   and to add new facilities to existing ones. “The allocations exemplify our promise to take public health to the last man,” said Siddharth Nath Singh, state health minister.
 
 State women and child department allocated Rs 100 crore for maternity benefits. “Women’s health is an indicator of how developed a society is, hence the scheme,” said Rita Bahuguna Joshi, minister for women and child development who also holds the family welfare portfolio. She added that the Shabari scheme, part of BJP’s sankalp patra and answer to nutritional deficiencies in women and children, had also been taken care of with the outlay.
