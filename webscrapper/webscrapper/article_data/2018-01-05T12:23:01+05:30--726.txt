 This is the first time the GSPCB has called for a personal hearing. “Failure to remain present before the board on the (stated) date and time will compel the board to proceed further in the matter of the said showcause notice without any further notice to you,” GSPCB member secretary Levinson Martins stated in the notice.
 
 The GSPCB had issued a showcause notice to SWPL seeking an explanation why the consent to operate granted to the firm should not be revoked for handling coal of an excess amount of 5.987 million tonnes (MT) per annum. “Failure to satisfactorily reply to the present notice will compel the board to initiate stringent legal action against you that will include revocation of the renewal of the consent to operate,” the GSPCB member secretary had stated in the showcause notice.
 
 The SWPL had subsequently denied that air pollution in the port town was caused due its excess handling of coal at   ( ). It had stated that if GSPCB were to revoke its consent to operate, there would be a deficit of steel in the market. 
 
 The company has requested the board for a “grace period” of four weeks before passing any order against the coal-handling plant.
