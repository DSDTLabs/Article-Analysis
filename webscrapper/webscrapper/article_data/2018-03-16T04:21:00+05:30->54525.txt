Vadodara: The final match of the Maharaja Ranjeetsinh Gaekwad Memorial Open Gujarat Tournament T20 tournament will be played at Madhavrao Scindia Stadium on Friday.

The tournament has been organized by the Western Railway Mazdoor Sangh (WRMS). Teams from different states participated in this tournament that was inaugurated by city police commissioner Manoj Sashidhar. 
 
 “In 1988, when late Madhavrao Scindia was watching a cricket match in Pratapnagar, the WRMS requested him to build a cricket stadium as Baroda had produced many international cricketers. He promptly agreed,” said J G Mahurkar, general secretary, Western Railway Mazdoor Sangh had said.
 
 The prizes will be given away at the stadium at 5 pm on Friday on the occasion of Mahurkar’s 83rd birthday. Apart from Mahurkar, Royal family members Shubhanginiraje Gaekwad and Radhikaraje Gaekwad, Rajeev Gupta, director general, National Academy of Indian Railways (NAIR), Amit Kumar Singh, DRM, Vadodara will give prizes to winners, runners-up, best bowlers, best batsmen, best fielders and best all-rounders of the tournament. 
 
 Named after late Maharaja Ranjeetsinh, the tourney has been dedicated to the royal scion of Gaekwad family who himself was a cricketer with first-class career spanning over nine years. Unlike other tournaments, WRMS never has sponsors or advertisements during this tournament. They spend their own money as the aim behind organizing this tourney is to promote sports and talented sportspersons.
