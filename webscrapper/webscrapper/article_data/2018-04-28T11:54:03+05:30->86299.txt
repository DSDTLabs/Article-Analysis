AHMEDABAD: The cut-off percentile for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test PG and NEET Super Speciality exams is likely to be reduced by nearly 15 percentile, from the existing cut-off which was the 50th percentile. The decision will ensure that more students get admission to postgraduate medical and dental courses which would otherwise go vacant. 

 A statement issued by the Union health ministry announced the decision to reduce the cut-off. The decision will benefit about 18,000 candidates while improving the chances of filling up PG seats and minimizing wastage of seats, it said.
 
 Officials in the state government said this was not the first time that the   has revised downwards the qualifying percentile. In 2017, the authorities decided to reduce the cut-off by 7.5 percentile. Officials said that the Gujarat government medical admission committee has already completed the first round of admissions and is waiting for the second round of admissions for the all-India quota to be completed. The officer said once the notification is published, the admissions committee in Gujarat will again invite applications from students and begin admission afresh, for students lower down on the merit list.
