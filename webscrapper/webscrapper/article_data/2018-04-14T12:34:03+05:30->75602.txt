MADURAI: Around 20 final year students of Madurai Agriculture College & Research Institute have formed   and have come up with an idea of dehydration and pacing of vegetables. 
 
 One of the club members,   said that it is a set-up where they will pool in entrepreneurial ideas and work on them for start-ups. As a team they will support each other with the start-ups, he said.
 
 In their first start-up idea, they are planning to collect carrot, beetroot, tomato and onion from   vegetable market in  , the Asia's biggest vegetable market, when the prices of these vegetables nosedive. 
 
 They will store them in state-of-art cold storage facility and further dehydrate it without any disturbance to its aroma and nutrient content. 
 
 Such packed vegetables will be exported when prices are down and sold in urban areas when their prices go up again. They will be working on this project in first phase, students said.
