RANCHI: Chief minister   on Tuesday tabled annual budget for the financial year 2018-19 in the assembly, but without the presence of the opposition. Minutes before he stood to read out his budget speech the opposition parties resorted to protests wearing black masks. When the chief minister's repeated requests went unheard, speaker   suspended the protesting MLAs from the day's proceedings, reacting to which the entire opposition staged a walk out. 

 Das, who also holds finance portfolio in state, addressed the treasury benches alone.   said that his government was committed to fulfil the aspirations of Prime Minister   who expressed his desire to constitute new India. "Accordingly we have planned to make new Jharkhand and this year's budget is aimed at strengthening rural Jharkhand," he said. 
 
 While government announced maximum budgetary allocation of Rs 11,771 crore for rural development and panchayati raj department, Das also proposed to double the income of people in rural Jharkhand through a series of interventions proposed by government which includes opening up of a skill development university in state. Das said that during the current fiscal around 2 lakh appointments were made by the government and another 50,000 appointments would be completed by June 2018.
