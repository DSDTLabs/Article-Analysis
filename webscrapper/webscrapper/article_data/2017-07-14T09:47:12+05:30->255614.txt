KALABURAGI: He is the rain swami. As he clambers up the neem tree at   village in Sedam taluk, there is expectation among the villagers that the clouds will open up. It could happen anytime on any day.

 Thursday was Mahadev Swami's sixth day on the tree. Famed as the swamiji who brings rain wherever he meditates, he doesn't eat or drink, nor does he speak to anyone till it begins to rain. Neither does he give up and come down. Though people throng the area to get his blessings, the swami sits with dedication on the tree.
 
 The swami, 60, is from   mutt in Bhawgi village near Bidar, where he resides. Having given up his family 30 years ago, he is now a roaming swami who helps distraught villages get rain. This is second time he is meditating in Neelahalli. Two years ago, he meditated for a month without having food and water. Finally, the village got heavy rain, following which the villagers celebrated its festival grandly , said Hanamanth Sahu. The swami completed meditation at Margol village in Chittapur a month ago. After that, it poured.
 
 When he came to Neelahalli village, the villagers made a place for him to sit, besides a bed of fodder to lie down on. Originally a resident of   village in Sedam taluk, he is famous for bringing rain through his meditation. This year, Neelahalli villagers requested him as they received little rain and need more rain as their lands have been drying up due to lack om treetop of moisture. People also believe that wherever the swamiji mediates, it rains with a vengeance.
 
 The swami agreed to go to Neelahalli and warned the villagers that he should not be disturbed by anyone till it rains. He said he always mediates for the welfare of the farming community as well as the country . This is the 29th year that the swami is meditating in the taluk. A gram panchayat member of   said they have great faith in the swami's power of meditation.
