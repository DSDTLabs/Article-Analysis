LUCKNOW:   has approved plan for a building to lodge   at a stone’s throw distance from the newly-built   on banks of   in Ghaziabad.

 Construction of Haj House had begun in 2005 and the project was inaugurated by then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav last year. A recent programme on Sunday organised by Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation at the   building site allowed parking of vehicles at the same spot used by Haj House visitors, confirmed Ghaziabad Mayor Anshu Verma. Haj House is only a couple of hundred metres away from the proposed Kailash Mansarovar Yatri building, said Verma.
 
 Before the chief minister announced construction of Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan either in or around New Delhi to lodge pilgrims, Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation Board had already passed proposal to construct Kailash Mansarovar Evam Kaanvar Yatri Bhawan on July 14, 2016.
 
 The Ghaziabad Mayor confirmed to TOI that on April 1, that along with four BJP MLAs from Ghaziabad, he had met chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi and offered the state government land for Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan. On May 5, Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation Board passed a proposal to hand over the land to the state government free of cost. 
 
 The land is 8,120 sq metre in size, said UP government spokesman Siddharthnath Singh, adding that construction of the building would be complete in two years at an estimated cost of Rs 50 crore.
 
 Since scores of ‘kanvariyas’ pass through GT Road during the season and Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims’ first halt after their journey begins from Delhi is Ghaziabad, the bhawan was a long felt need, said Ghaziabad BJP general seretary Rajeev Agrawal.
 
 On selection of land near Haj House, the mayor said the BJP believes in “sabka saath, sabka vikas” and “sarva dharm sambhav”. Otherwise too, adjacent to Mansarovar bhawan is Dashashmesh Vatika besides the Haj House, said the mayor.
