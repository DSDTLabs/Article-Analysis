KOLKATA: Less than one-fourth of liver and gastrointestinal patients in Kolkata and east India receive proper treatment, leading to a high mortality rate, say experts. The number of liver transplants done is less than half the required figure. However, as   observed World Health Day on Friday, this dismal picture seems ready to change.

 The   is giving shape to a state-of-the-art hospital -Indian Institute of Liver and Digestive Sciences. It will have 100 beds and will carry out liver transplants at half the market rate. Other diagnostic facilities and surgeries at the hospital will be priced much lower than the prevailing costs, ac cording to  , project director, Liver Foundation. The hospital, which has been partially functional for a year, will start admitting patients from the middle of May and will be a major step ahead for liver and gastrointestinal treatment in the region, felt Mukherjee. “This is the third hospital of its kind in the country. So far, 80% of liver patients would travel to south India for treatment.But now, with the kind of facilities that we are offering, the flight would be reversed. The idea is to specialize in liver and gastrointestinal treatment. We don't believe in multispeciality,“ said Mukherjee.
 
 Being set up for Rs 40 crore, the hospital has been funded by corporates. Transplants, though, can't be done immediately after the hospital turns fully functional. “We must go through the legal formalities and procedures which will take some time. We hope to be able to flag off transplants in a year,“ said Mukherjee.
 
 Another city hospital has launched an effort to help chronic kidney patients and their families. Fortis Hospital has joined hands with the Institute of   & Behavioural Sciences for a chronic kidney patients' support group. Families of kidney patients will be brought together to help them cope with the stress.
