AMRITSAR: In a bizarre incident that could put Khakhi to shame,   of a police station instructed a hapless complainant to give him shoulder message in the police station.

 In a video that went viral on Thursday evening, SHO of Sultanwind police station Rameshwar Singh is seen getting his shoulder and back massaged by a turbaned person in presence of his family members including females.
 
 Assistant police commissioner (south) Prabhjot Singh said that taking cognizance of the video, police had suspended the SHO and begun an internal inquiry. “SHO’s conduct and action with public was found against police image, so he has been suspended,” said Prabhjot.
 
 He said police was still investigating into the identity of the complainant who was asked to give shoulder massage by the SHO.
 
 According to sources, the SHO had been taking similar favours from a complainant for past some time. The latter sought help from his friend to record the shoulder massage on a mobile phone and make it public.
