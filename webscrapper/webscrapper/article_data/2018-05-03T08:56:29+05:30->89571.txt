As  , the chauffeur of Karur district collector, T   prepared for the last day of his government service, little did he know that he was in for an emotional parting gift. The Karur   himself volunteered to take the wheel from him to hand his driver the most memorable send-off on his retirement day.

 This humble gesture from the collector won many hearts, most noticeably that of Paramasivam who has been serving him towards the final days of his 35-year-long driving career. On Monday, during the send-off, collector stunned everyone by announcing that he would be driving Paramasivam and his family home as a gesture to honour his service.
 
 Anbazhagan then collected the key and drove Paramasivam and his family to their home at  , much to the happiness of many. Asked of his gesture, the collector waxed eloquence about his driver. “As a driver, he deserved this honour. Throughout his service, Paramasivam has been at the wheel just as a driver. At least, on the final day, I wanted him to sit in the car not as a driver,” the collector told TOI.
 
 Paramasivam, who served as a driver for seven collectors, said that he was overwhelmed by the gift. “This is something I never expected. During the ceremony, the collector presented me a with ring. But when he said that he would drive me home, I was moved. He came to our house, drank tea, spent some time with us before leaving,” said the 58-year-old man.
 
 Anbazhagan took charge as the collector in Karur in March and earned praise from the public when he visited an 80-year-old woman Rakkammal’s house at   where she was living alone. Sitting by her, he listened to the woman and shared his meal with her. The collector had also made available Rs 1,000 as a monthly old-age pension for her.
 
 Two years ago, another bureaucrat, G Sreekanth, who was serving as a collector in Akola district in Maharashtra, did a similar gesture when he acted as a chauffeur for his driver on the occasion of his retirement.
