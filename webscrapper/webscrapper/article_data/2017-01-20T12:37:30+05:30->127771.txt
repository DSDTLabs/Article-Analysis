THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the expenditure of state plan funds still progressing at a snail's pace, chief minister   has expressed strong reservations about the spending of more than one third of the fund in the last quarter of the financial year, that began on January 1. 

 In a review meeting held here on Wednesday, the chief minister said that   expenditure figures till December 31 are 9% less than that in the same period last year. At the same time, he said that no more than one-third of the total plan size should be spent in the ongoing quarter. While the figure was 42% till the end of December in the last financial year, the current figures are only 32%.
 
 While the state's total plan size for the current financial year is Rs 24,000 crore and the total expenditure till December 31 has reached only Rs 7,591.05 crore, the state's expenditure till March 31 is unlikely to cross 60% of the total funds.
 
 This would be a far inferior performance compared to the last financial year in which the government had managed to spend 77% of the total outlay, buoyed by the performances of sectors like tourism and labour. 
 
 Of the Rs 20,000 crore plan outlay for the previous financial year, the expenditure up to March 31 was Rs 15,493.92 crore. The previous financial year also had marked an improvement in the plan outlay expenditure, as it had stood at 71% in the preceding year, 2014-15. 
 
 "Unless the procedure of giving clearance for spending funds and releasing it are streamlined, the expenditure will remain low. Though the spending power of department heads have been increased to Rs 10 crore from Rs 5 crore, the long process involved is still a real bottleneck," a top finance department official said. 
 
 Meanwhile, the fate of 26 centrally-sponsored schemes are also not very bright as only Rs 1,127.83 crore of the Rs 3,553.90 crore (32%) have been spent till December 31. Also, 16 of the schemes have not even taken off with the expenditure against them being zero, as per the data accessed by TOI.
 
 Among the zero expenditure schemes are Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-urban (Rs 183.20 crore outlay), Swachh Bharat Mission-urban (Rs 75 crore), Rashtriya Uchch Shiksha Abhiyan (Rs 96.57 crore), Urban Rejuvenation Mission (AMRUT and smart cities mission) with an outlay of Rs 325 crore and   (Rs 30 crore).
