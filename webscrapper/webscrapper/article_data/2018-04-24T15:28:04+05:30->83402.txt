BENGALURU: Actor and exminister M H   declined the   ticket from  .

 Ambareesh, who had been avoiding Congress leaders all these days after his candidature was announced, sent word through his long-time friend Amravathi Chandrashekar to the CM that he would not contest the elections.
 
 Chandrashekhar, who runs a hotel in Mandya, has been mediating between the sitting   and the chief minister over the past couple of days.
 
 Party sources said during his discussions with the CM,   had expressed his desire to contest from Mandya. However, Siddaramaiah reportedly told him that he would not “refer’’ anyone for a ticket but would discuss the issue with AICC general secretary   in-charge K C Venugopal late Monday night.
 
 Ambareesh is miffed with the party after he was dropped from the cabinet in 2016. The party high command, it is said, decided to renominate him as he has a huge following in Mandya, Mysuru, Hassan and Tumukuru districts. Indications are that the party may field Mandya district unit president M S Atmananda from the constituency.
