Hyderabad: “Disturbed” over the killing of Hyderabad-based techie Srinivas Kuchibhotla in a shooting in a Kansas City bar recently, Nasscom chairman C P Gurnani said the apex IT body has reached out to US officials expressing concern over the incident and that they had been apologetic about it.

 “I am disturbed… We raised this concern and you also saw President Trump made this point in his message…we are with the family and clearly believe that “America Great” means that people living in America have to be treated with greatness too,” Gurnani said. Reacting to the killing of the Hyderabad-based techie, US President Donald Trump had recently said, “We are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.” Advising Indian techies working in the US, Gurnani said they must make efforts to mingle with the local community. “This is what my father told me...that the world does not owe you anything, you have to integrate and become part of that community. So my request is to integrate, make an effort to become a part of their society and if you become a part of their society, the ‘us versus them’ will no longer be there,” he explained. Ruling out any dip in IT industry growth due to recent events, he said the apex IT body will stick to its earlier guidance of 8-10% for FY17. On hiring too he pointed out that the pace of job growth in the sector may not keep pace with the IT sector growth due to the rise in automation and increasing efficiencies of the existing engineers.
