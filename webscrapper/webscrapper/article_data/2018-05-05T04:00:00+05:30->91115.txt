Mumbai: Come October 1, Indian investors may be able to trade in   contracts till almost midnight. 

 Markets regulator   on Friday allowed bourses to extend trading hours in the stock   segment to up to 11.55pm from 3.30pm in line with the timings in the   segment. According to Sebi, this has been done to enable integration of trading of various segments of securities market at the level of exchanges.
 
  The nod came on the back of Sebi board’s permission for all exchanges to offer trading facilities in stocks as well as commodities. 
 
 The move is expected to put Indian stock F&O market on a par with international markets in terms of trading hours and would also help mitigate risks in the Indian market that earlier emanated from the time difference, market players said. 
 
 Sebi said the trading hours have been extended, provided the stock exchange and its clearing corporation(s) have in place   system and infrastructure commensurate to the trading hours. 
 
 The exchanges will need to present Sebi a detailed proposal, including its framework for risk management,  ,  ,  ,   and   to extend their trading hours.
 
 According to BSE MD & CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan, globally derivative exchanges are already following the extended trading hours and “the introduction of the extended hours (in India) is a positive development and will bring Indian market in line with international markets”.The move will help increase the depth of the Indian capital markets and will also mitigate the risk of developments across international markets impacting the Indian market due to the time difference, said Sanjit Prasad, MD & CEO,   ( ).
 
 Association of National Exchanges Members of India president Rajesh Baheti, however, cautioned that the extended trading hours should be restricted to index derivatives alone and should not cover individual stocks, as such a step “may be vulnerable to abuse by unscrupulous elements”.
