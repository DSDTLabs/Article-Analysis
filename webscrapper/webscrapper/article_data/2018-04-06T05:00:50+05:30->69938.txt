NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry on Thursday said it had forwarded the proposal of the   government seeking religious minority tag for the   community, to the minority affairs ministry, which was the "competent authority to take a decision on the issue".

 An   spokesperson said a decision on the issue is not expected any time soon as the model code of conduct is in force in assembly pollbound Karnataka. The MHA has received a communication from the Karnataka government recommending grant of religious minority status for the numerically strong Lingayat community.
 
 "However, the subject is beyond the jurisdiction of the MHA and hence forwarded to the ministry of the minority affairs, which is the competent authority to take adecision on it,"he said.
 
 Asked whether the MHA has given any opinion on the recommendation of the Karnataka government before forwarding it, he said the question did not arise as it was not an issue to be examined by the MHA.
