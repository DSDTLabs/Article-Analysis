GUWAHATI: Former Nagaland chief minister TR   appeared before the   at its New Delhi headquarters on Saturday in connection with the agency's ongoing investigation into the alleged siphoning off of government funds to the militant outfit National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) and other Naga outfits during his tenure. Questioning was postponed, however, after Zeliang appealed that he be questioned at his residence owing to his age. 

 "He (Zeliang) has made an appeal that he has crossed 65 years of age and, being a senior citizen, wants to be questioned at his residence and not at the NIA office. Our legal cell will examine his appeal and if it is found to be justified, we will accept his plea," an investigating official said. The official added, "It is not that we want to interrogate him for nothing. The investigation warrants that he be examined too."
 
 The NIA also summoned Zeliang's former personal secretary  .
 
 Meanwhile, the Myanmar-based NSCN (K) questioned why the NIA has not probed the parallel taxation system run by NSCN (Isak-Muivah), accusing it of turning a blind eye to the activities of its rival group. NSCN (I-M), at present engaged in a peace process with the Centre, is known to impose "taxes" on citizens of Nagaland quite openly. In April last year, for instance, the outfit had announced that it had decided to "ease the burden of tax-payers" by slashing "employee tax" from 24% to 12% of their monthly salaries and asked people to "cooperate".
 
 "When has the Indian government legalised IM's extortion and taxation activities in Nagaland state? From the experiences gained all along, IM is one of the most arrogant, uncompromising, merciless and unforgiving group with prompt harsh Azha (order) when it comes to collection of money, commissions, extortion, fines etc upon the Nagas in Nagaland," NSCN (K) spokesperson   said in a statement posted on social media.
