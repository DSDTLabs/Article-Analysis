Stand up comedian and TV actor   was in Dubai recently for his comedy gig, which was attended by none other than the Bollywood actress  .
 
  Shilpa thanked Dr. Mashoor Gulati for bringing smiles to everyone's face and for all the fun she had during her gig.
  
  
 
  
  She took to Twitter to share a selfie of herself with Dr. Gulati and wrote, "Many laughs tonight thanks to the very talented @WhoSunilGrover #dubai #jokes #laughter #fun."
  
  
  
  While the duo was in Dubai, fans in India morphed Rinku Bhabhi aka   Grover's picture and placed it with Shilpa's husband Raj Kundra. They are seen striking a Titanic pose in the photo.
  
  Sunil shared the photo on twitter and wrote, "While we were in Dubai for this event, aap yeh dekho Mumbai main kya ho raha tha @TheShilpaShetty."
  
  
  
  Sunil Grover might have gone missing from The   Show, but there is nothing stopping him from enacting Dr. Mashoor Gulati on stage, not just in India, but overseas as well.
  
  There were reports recently that Sunil along with his co-contestants Ali Asgar and Chandan Prabhakar would be returning to the show and have already started shooting for it.
