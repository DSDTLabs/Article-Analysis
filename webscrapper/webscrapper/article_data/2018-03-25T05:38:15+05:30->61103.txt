MUMBAI: Investigating officer Daya Nayak from Amboli police station has summoned principal Zakiya Shaikh of Mumbra’s Kiddies’ Paradise and her husband in the paper leak case. 

 
  
  
 The police said that Shaikh’s husband, though not part of the school management, would go to custody centres and pick up SSC papers. 
 
 Shaikh did not respond to TOI’s calls on Saturday. A total of 302 students took SSC exams at the   this year. According to board rules, only school staff can be appointed to conduct and supervise SSC exams. 
 
 “We will conduct an inquiry to find out if the school has flouted any rules. We only register examiners and moderators. Schools are required to use legally appointed staff as invigilators,” said Subhash Borse, in-charge secretary of state board’s Mumbai division. 
 
 The police have said that Khan leaked five papers. Khan has told the police that he got access to the papers between 9am to 9.15am. However on March 19, after the paper leak came to light, Shaikh had told TOI that she would unseal the bundle only at 10am. 
 
 She had said, “The papers arrive around 9am. They are on my table and no one is allowed to touch them. We start opening the bundles only at 10am. Khan may have got the papers from outside. We are clueless about his wrongdoings and are shocked. Had we known about it, we would have complained immediately.” Khan too has told the police that the principal was unaware that he had been leaking the papers. The police have also learnt that Khan had been sending the papers at least to seven other people in Aurangabad.
