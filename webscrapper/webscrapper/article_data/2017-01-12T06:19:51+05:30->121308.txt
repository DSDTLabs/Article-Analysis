PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation’s school board on Wednesday launched a   to put the institutions’ inspection data online and make it accessible to all authorities.

 The app was launched at a two-day programme to exhibit innovative practices in   schools by teachers ‘Shikshanache Wari’. The tool will have about 15 indicators for which the inspectors can upload their data. The inspection factors include the student’s participation in class and usage of teaching tools. 
 
 A team of 29 subject experts and 22 assistant teachers have been trained. They will be given tablets to continuously monitor the progress of the 296 schools in PMC.
 
 Shubhangi Chavan, the PMC school board’s administrative head, said, “This app will help us monitor the progress of every child and every school. There is also a questionnaire containing 25 questions in language, science and mathematics. Any school getting above 80% marks in all classes will be called ‘pragat’. First, the teachers will take this test and then PMC officials will cross-check the data from schools at random to make sure the uploaded figures are genuine.”
