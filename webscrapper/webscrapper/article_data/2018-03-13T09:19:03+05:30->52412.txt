CHANDIGARH: The Opposition parties criticised finance minister   on Monday for his remarks that barring a few officers in the state government, most do not have a good command over English and cannot even draft a letter properly. “Except for a few officers of Punjab, most don’t know how to write in English-....On reading the memorandums that are sent to the Government of India, we hold our head inshame and wonder what are they writing and how did they clear the IAS test,” Manpreet said at the World Punjabi Conference.

 Commenting on Badal’s remarks, AAP leader   said if what he said was true, then it was an unfortunate scenario and the   government should take action against such officers. “If the bureaucrats are not well versed in English and cannot even write an official letter, it is a sad thing,” he said.
 
 SAD president   said maybe Manpreet doesn’t know English himself and claimed he appeared to be fond of Urdu. BJP leaders criticised the finance minister, saying his remarks were a reflection of the sorry state of affairs in the government.
 
  leader   said it seemed Manpreet was fond of English.
