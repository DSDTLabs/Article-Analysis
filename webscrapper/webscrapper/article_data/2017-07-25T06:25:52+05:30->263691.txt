AHMEDABAD: No respite is in sight from heavy rains which have created flood-like situations in many parts of the state.   (IMD) Gujarat officials on Monday predicted heavy to very heavy  , mainly in northeastern parts, for next three days.

 Meteorologists said Gujarat has recorded 61% of total seasonal rainfall by July 23, and it may reach 70% in the next two to three days.
 
 According to IMD, Ahmedabad received 24.2 mm rainfall from 8.30am to 5.30pm on Monday. The city had recorded 64.2mm rainfall from 8.30am on Sunday to 8.30am on Monday. Deesa in   district recorded the highest rainfall of 149.8mm from 8.30am to 5.30pm on Monday.
 
 On Monday, heavy rains started in Ahmedabad from early morning and the incessant rainfall continued to pour over the city leading to waterlogging in many areas. Areas like Vastrapur, Gota, Ghatlodia, Hatkeshwar, Rakhial, Nikol, Bapunagar and Amraiwadi witnessed heavy water-logging on Monday. Woes of the citizens may increase as the intermittent rains are all likely to continue on Tuesday.
 
 Jayant Sarkar, director of IMD-Gujarat, said that rains have been caused due to low pressure area that lies over southwest Rajasthan and neighbourhood, with associated upper air cyclonic circulation.
 
 “Improvement in the situation or respite from the heavy to very heavy rainfall may be expected from July 27 onwards,” he said, adding that Ahmedabad may continue to witness intermittent rains on Tuesday.
 
 “There is a low pressure area now lying over southwest Rajasthan and neighbourhood with associated upper air cyclonic circulation extending upto 7.6km,” Sarkar said. 
 
 Because of this system, he said that Gujarat, mainly the northeastern parts of the state, including Sabarkantha, Banaskantha, Mehsana and  , will witness heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places and extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places over Gujarat region.
 
 Sarkar said, “We also expect heavy to very heavy rainfall over Saurashtra and Kutch regions.”
