NEW DELHI: Newly designed   are now capable of opening doors, and watching them in action is like watching the terrifying reel-life ‘Aliens’ come alive.

 Massachusetts-based robotics firm Boston Dynamics has redesigned its   robot to enable it to not just walk up and down but also to reach out for a door handle and pull open a door. SpotMini was first unveiled in November last year.
 
 The company yesterday released a 45-second video titled, 'Hey Buddy, Can You Give Me a Hand?', to showcase its newly able robots. The video shows a four-legged droid confidently and purposefully collaborating with its droid colleague to deftly pull open a door.
 
  
  
 The sight of the SpotMinis cleverly manipulating their arms and legs to achieve a common goal has left many on social media a tad terrified.
 
  
  
 Boston Dynamics, which is now owned by Japanese tech-giant Softbank, didn’t release more details about these new SpotMinis but the video footage made many on Twitter fear a dystopian apocalypse.
 
  
  
  
  
 SpotMini is a nimble robot that can handle objects, climb stairs, wash dishes, pick up trash, and perform other similar household tasks.
