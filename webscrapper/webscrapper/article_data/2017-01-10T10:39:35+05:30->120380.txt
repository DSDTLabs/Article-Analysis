KOLKATA:   received a   at his home forbidding him to attend a   later this month. Ganguly who is now the president of the  , reportedly got the letter by post on Saturday. “I have intimated the whole matter to the police as well as the organizers of the programme there,” he said on Monday.   said they were reviewing his security arrangements after the threat.

 Without revealing the whole content of the letter, Ganguly said it warned him of grave consequences if he dares to visit the district.
 
  Asked whether he will be travelling for the programme now, the southpaw said, “I have not decided yet and am waiting to hear from the authorities on this.”
 
  This is not the first time though that Ganguly has received such a threat. He was once a target of a terror organization along with other cricketing legends like Sachin Tendulkar.
 
 In 2008, he admitted that he and his family had received two threat letters, one even going to the extent of threatening to kidnap his daughter Sana. While one was from Indian Mujahideen, the other was reportedly from Maoists. 
 
 “This time, the letter seems innocuous and might even be a prank. But the special branch has been activated and they will file a report in this regard even if no complaint is lodged as part of a routine exercise,” said an officer. 
 
 Cops said the scan is necessary given certain areas of Midnapore are still frequented by Maoists. 
 
 However, it is important for two other reasons felt state officials — firstly, this is the first time such a threat has reached his Behala residence after a gap of almost nine years and secondly, there is explicit reference of a certain place which no other earlier letter had mentioned.
