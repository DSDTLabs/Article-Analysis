HYDERABAD: Delivering its verdict in the   ( ) National Park Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) case on Wednesday, the southern bench of the   (NGT) put the ball in the Centre's court, indicating the multicrore flyover project can become a reality only after the EcoSensitive Zone (ESZ) of the national park is fixed by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC).In its 39-page judgment delivered after multiple hearings conducted over the last one year, the two-member bench of the NGT concluded that the MoEF&CC has to take an appropriate decision and publish a revised draft notification regarding the much-important ESZ of the park, which is now spread over 390 acres.
 
  “The project proponents, in our considerate view and in all fairness, shall wait till a final decision is taken in this regard by the MoEF&CC and then proceed,“ an extract from the judgment read. This is what the ver dict means: In case the Union ministry sticks to the earlier proposal of the   state to fix the ESZ of the   at 25-35 metres -which will include the walkway around the park -the government here will require to obtain an environment clearance (EC) from the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (as is the norm) before implementing the SRDP .But, in case the MoEF&CC decides to honour the revised proposal sent by the state -which suggests that the ESZ be reduced to zero -then the plan will not require an EC and the state government can go ahead with cuttingtranslocation of trees for the project.
  
  Earlier this month, TOI had reproduced a letter sent to the Union ministry by the state government, proposing the ESZ of the park be revised to `zero metres' from `25-35 metres'.
  
  While the Union ministry confirmed receipt of the proposal, it said that the matter was still under consideration.
