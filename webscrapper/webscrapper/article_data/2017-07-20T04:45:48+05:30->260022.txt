NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday latched on to leaked   documents on its strategy to disrupt   and corner the   and accused the main opposition of diverting attention from more pressing issues of national security.

 “Rather than focusing on more relevant issue of national security, Congress has given priority on raising incidents of lynching by mobs and cow vigilantism and giving them communal colour,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra told reporters, waving a copy of the leaked party document.
 
 Terming it a “dossier of disruption”, BJP alleged that Congress had picked incidents with the sole objective of giving them a communal colour. “In this leaked document, they have mentioned about Junaid and Akhlaq but why is there no mention of lynching of police officer Ayub Pandith in Srinagar,” Patra alleged.
