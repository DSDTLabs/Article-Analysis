NAVI MUMBAI: Residents have been questioning the recent transfer of the commissioner of   ( ),   to Ulhasnagar. Meanwhile, political parties in Panvel are blaming each other for seeking his ouster.

 Kharghar residents are collecting signatures for an online petition to CM, demanding his reinstatement. A rally has been planned on Monday by Panvel Mahapalika Sangarsh Samiti in support of Shinde.
 
 Local BJP MLA, Prashant Thakur has held the opposition coalition, comprising PWP, Congress and NCP, responsible for seeking Shinde’s transfer. However, Sandip Patil of PWP said, “We strongly support the Monday rally and oppose the transfer of Shinde.’’ 
 
 Several residents of the developed Kharghar node (now a part of PCMC) have questioned the transfer, reportedly based on poll issues, and demanded to know when will he be brought back to head the Panvel civic body.

 “We appreciate the good work done by the upright officer to fight encroachment and other issues in the city,’’said residents. President of the samiti, Kantilal Kadu said, “We have the support of political parties for the Monday march for Shinde.’’
