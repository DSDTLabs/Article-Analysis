GURUGRAM: All the six policemen posted at the   branch, which has been in news since last year for alleged irregularities and a licencing scam, were shifted to the   lines on Thursday.

 
 The mass transfer was ordered after a surprise visit by police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar to the branch office during the day. 
 
 The police chief sought to play down the issue and termed it a regular  . “These are routine changes and we are trying to restructure the entire branch,” Khirwar said. 
 
 But sources said the cops were shunted out after several complaints of irregularities were received against them. The sources also said the team had been accused of delaying the process and making unreasonable demands from those applying for arms licences. Head constable Naveen was leading the arms licence team.
 
 According to senior officers, the department has already come up with a new set of rules to deny outsiders entry into the arms licence office. From now, applicants will have to submit their applications through a window. The move is aimed at preventing one-to-one interactions among the cops and applicants, said an officer.
 
 A special investigation by joint commissioner of police Sibas Kabiraj had unearthed a fake arms licence scam in Gurugram in February last year. Subsequently, an FIR was registered against Manish Bhardwaj and his accomplice Mohan Lal at Civil Lines police station. The duo were arrested later.
 
 The probe also revealed involvement of some policemen in the scam. Three cops — inspector Jasmer Singh, former in-charge of the arms licence branch, sub-inspector Virender Singh and head constable Mahesh Kumar — were arrested and chargesheeted in the case later.
