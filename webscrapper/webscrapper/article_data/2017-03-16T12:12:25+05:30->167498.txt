NAGPUR: Poems laced with satire and humour marked the ‘hasya kavi sammelan’ organized to mark the   by   and Mahal Bahu-uddeshiya Sanskrutik Mandal at Khonde Udyan, Tulsibagh Road, on Wednesday evening.

 The event was organized in the open ground with shining stars giving company to the poets who had the audience in splits. Anil Malokar and Avinash Bagde were the key poets at the event. Commenting on the double-faced people in society, Malokar said, much to the amusement of the gathering, “Jise samjhe koyal woh kawwa nikla, daru ke khilaf jo bola usi ke jeb se pawwa nikla”. The poets mostly spoke on social taboos and the audience responded to the jokes with lots of cheers and occasional ‘wah-wahs’ in appreciation. 
 
 Talking about hypocrisy of politicians, Bagde said, “Ek netaji bole hum nakshe Hindustan ke badal denge, hum ne kaha kuchh hafto main to aap apna bayaan badal denge”. Encouraging the youth through his poems, he said, “Ek poster laga tha talkies ke gate pe, pyar kiye ja concession rate pe”. 
 
 Subhash Raut shared his experience in a train when a passenger asked him about his profession to which he replied “I am a poet. When the poet asked him who he was, he sarcastically said that he was deaf.” In a way, Raut showed how people in general look at poets. 
 
  nicely described a frustrated husband’s request to his father-in-law, saying, “Apni lado bitiyan ko kuchh din bulalo papaji, roj roj ek jhagdo se kuchh din bachalo papaji”. The poets used different tunes to enlighten the atmosphere and the audience was mesmerized. 
 
 Newly elected corporators of the area, Neha Waghmare, Sumedha Deshpande and Pravin Datke were present at the event. 
 
  who attended the programme said, “It was very good. We enjoyed a lot. Programmes like this should be regularly organized to make people social.”
