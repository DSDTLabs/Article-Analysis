SURAT: A   from   will be representing the country at the   to be held in Bahamas from April 21. 

 Twenty-two-year-old Sarita Gaekwad will be part of women's 4x400 metres relay team in the biennial competition of International Association of Athletic Federation (IAAF), the first instance of a tribal athlete from south   representing the country at an international event.
 
 Sarita, daughter of a farm labourer from Karadi Amba village near Ahwa in Dang, is a first year student of MR Desai Arts and Commerce College, Navsari district.
 
 “Sarita, who used to play kho-kho, took up athletics during secondary education. We had offered her a seat in our college in sports quota,” said  , her coach in the college.
 
 Sarita has clocked 55.56 seconds in 400 meters run and is now among the top three runners in the country. She has been training at Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports, Patiala, since her selection. Earlier she used to do long jumps, high jumps and half marathon. However, for the past six months, she has been concentrating only on 4x400 metres relay.
 
 “I was always interested in sports. However, my family could not afford to provide me costly equipment for sports so I took up athletics, which is not cost prohibitive,” Sarita had told TOI some time back.
 
 Sarita wants to win a medal in Olympics and hence is prepared to do any amount of hard work. Her college and other sponsors are taking care of her expenses which come to around Rs1 lakh in a year. But it would really help her if more sponsors come forward, she said. “The college has spent around Rs50,000 on her training so far. We will manage through sponsorships,” Nayak added.
