HYDERABAD: Following a number of maternal deaths after being operated for  , the inflow of patients at the   in  , which had touched a bare minimum, is now slowly picking up pace.From handling only 50 cases a day , the hospital is now seeing patients slowly trickling in. In fact, many of the patients who were brought to the hospital earlier opted to be transferred to the government maternity hospital at   and the Niloufer hospital.

 Maternal wards to operation theatres, everything wore a deserted look following the maternal deaths. A total of eight deaths at the hospital were reported since mid-April. While this led to widespread fear among patients, health authorities said that most of the deaths were due to emergency cases coming in at the last minute. In many cases, the women had   count as low as 2-5 which led to complications following surgeries.
 
 “Even when high-risk patients come in and get into labour, we have no option but to operate. This might mean having to ignore the possibility of other existing complications. Since most of the women are too poor to afford regular check-ups, they do not have any records for reference. Under the circumstance, if a woman is operated upon when she has just 5 RBC count, she has little chance of survival,“ said a doctor.
 
 Insiders also alleged that only selective cases were being taken up and high risk patients were being diverted to other hospitals. Authorities clarified that no services were suspended.
