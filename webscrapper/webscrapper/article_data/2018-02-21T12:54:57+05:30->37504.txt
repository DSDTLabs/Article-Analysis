COIMBATORE:  ,  , had spent six times the actual amount on the maintenance of streetlights, as per the CAG audit report submitted to the assistant director of town panchayat P Ganeshram. The cost of the maintenance of the streetlights was not more than one lakh per year amount to nearly Rs 5.75 lakh for five years. But, the panchayat officials spent nearly Rs 36 lakh.

 The panchayat, spread over 13.60 sqkm, has 89 streets. There were about 575 street lights, mostly tubelights, until 2015. Only after 2016, 440 LED streetlights were installed.
 
 “It is shocking that the panchayat spent so much on the streetlight maintenance, as, on an average, not more than 10 street lights are repaired daily. The labour charge is not more than Rs 30 and only electric spares are replaced. Sometimes, the cost is nil in case of loose connection,” said K Nataraj, a resident.
 
 As per a former councillor in the area, only about 10 streetlights were repaired on a daily basis. “Some wards have many streetlights and the cost of repair may be high.. But, however we calculate, the cost cannot exceed Rs 1.5 lakh per year. This amount is unbelievable,” he said.
 
 Apart from this, the rates in which the panchayat bought the spares has also come under the scanner. The panchayat officials have bought at higher rates from companies that were not registered with the district collectorate.
 
 district collector TN Hariharan said that he will ask the AD town panchayat to look into the scam and take action. The AD town panchayat, P Ganeshram, could not be reached for comment.
 
  activist Daniel Jesudas, who brought out the scam, said that the senior officials were equally involved. “Year after year, the officials have sent audit reports to the AD panchayat but, he has not taken any action on them. He does not reply to our complaints and grievances either,” he said.
