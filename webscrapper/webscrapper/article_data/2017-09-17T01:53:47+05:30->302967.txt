GURUGRAM: Within three weeks, all private schools in the city will have to implement all applicable safety guidelines — including installation of CCTV cameras, and keeping an ambulance and a trained nurse on the campus to deal with any medical emergency — and submit a self-certification to the district administration.

 Deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh made these clear to representatives of over 300 private schools at a meeting at the mini secretariat in Gurgaon on Saturday, amid increasing concerns over the safety of children on school premises in the wake of the killing of seven-year-old   at   in Bhondsi. “We all have to ensure that a child or their parents do not feel worried when the student is in the school. We need to provide a safe environment for them. What has happened in Gurgaon in the past one week is tragic and things will only have to improve now,” said the deputy commissioner.
 
 After the expiry of the deadline, the district education department will conduct a safety audit of each school to verify their self-declaration.
 
 Since Pradhyumn’s death, the district administration is working towards compliance of safety guidelines by schools as per the   and Haryana School Education Act. CBSE issued fresh guidelines for child safety on September 12, which Gurgaon schools will also have to follow.
 
 As per the new guidelines, it is mandatory for schools to have CCTV cameras and police verification of staff. Apart from compliance with the Surakshit School Vahan Policy, all schools should have an emergency alarm accessible to students. Moreover, all schools should have a medical room, a trained nurse and an ambulance.
