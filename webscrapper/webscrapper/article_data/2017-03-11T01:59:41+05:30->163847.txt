MUMBAI: Tigran Wadia, a final year student of BMS from  , topped the MBA/MMS common entrance test 2017. Results of the CET, held online over the last weekend, were announced on Friday. The highest score of 145 bagged by Wadia, a Colaba resident, dropped from the previous year’s top score of 165, showing that the difficulty level of the paper had gone up this year. It was about 170 in 2015.

 Wadia got to know his scores late in the evening but he was unaware of his rank as the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) did not release a comprehensive list this year. He said he was keen to join Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies (JBMIS) but will not be able to comment on the difficulty level of the paper as it was his first attempt. “I thoroughly enjoyed preparing for the run-up to the CET and topping is the icing on the cake,” said Wadia.
 
 The second rank was bagged by Rahul Rodge, an engineering student, who scored 140. Sriram Krishnan, who scored 139, stood third in the state. Sriram, who runs a coaching institute in partnership, said the logical reasoning section was difficult and added that the difficulty level of the paper went up this year. “Completing the paper within the allotted time too was tough,” said Sriram. More than 94,000 candidates had registered for the test and about 90% appeared for it in three slots on Saturday and Sunday last week. The DTE will conduct admissions once the degree results are out in May and June.
 
 While JBIMS is the most sought-after institute in the state, Sydenham, K J Somaiya, SIES are other leading institutes to accept CET scores. Though JBIMS was planning to hold its own entrance test, due to lack of permission from the state government, the institute will participate in the centralised admission process (CAP) rounds conducted by DTE.
