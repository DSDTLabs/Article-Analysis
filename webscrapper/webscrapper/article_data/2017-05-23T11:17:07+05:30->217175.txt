PATNA: The state water resources department ( ) has prepared a mega project to protect and reclaim the 1.08km slope of natural soil in the upstream of the Gandak barrage in the   ( ) that had been eroded by floodwaters from Gandak. The department is planning to develop the reclaimed site into a tourist spot.

 The eroded site, which is along the upstream of the Gandak from the barrage, is near the Nepal border and the terrain constitutes a part of VTR whose overall natural expanse also incorporates areas of Nepal and India. Besides, the 1.08km eroded slope is around 1km from Valmikinagar bazaar. The eroded slope of the 1.08km-long natural soil is around 12 metres high from the lowest flood level. It constitutes a wild terrain of the VTRA in the Indian portion. 
 
 Moreover, a pitch road passes through the area between the Inspection Bungalow of the WRD near the barrage and the eroded slope. 
 
 “The erosion of the 1.08km long slope of natural soil of the Gandak along its upstream from the barrage has made the spot critical,” said a source, adding if the protection work is not launched, soil erosion would become more troublesome and could also damage the road.
 
 “The protection of the slope and the reclamation of the lost natural soil are important,” added the WRD source. After the eroded slope is protected and soil reclaimed, the spot, in the second phase of the work, would be developed into a popular tourist point. 
 
 The project will cost the department Rs 22 crore. For the implementation of the project, tender has already been floated by the WRD. However, the work on the project cannot be started unless   ( ) gives its due clearance, sources said.
