Nagpur: A troupe of nearly 80 women of Nagpur Mahila Club, most of them attired in dazzling blue saris as a dress code, came together to celebrate the 17th foundation day. Chef Vishnu Manohar was the chief guest of the event which was held at Vishnuji Ki Rasoi on Saturday evening.

 “We usually get bored cooking three meals a day, but Manohar has done it non-stop for 53 hours. He has taken this city to international level and made us proud. On this foundation day, I hope we can be of good service to all women and children,” said Vilasini Nair, president of the club.
 
  The members then felicitated Manohar for achieving the Guinness world record for cooking.
 
 Neelam Shukla was felicitated for being the most active member of the group. Vice-president Premlata Tiwari and programme coordinators Bharti Bisawal and Rupinder Chatwal played an active role in organizing the event.
 
 The club sponsored the eye operation of a girl of NGO Atmadeepam Society.
 
 A cookery show and interaction with Manohar were highlights of the event. City chefs Poonam Rathi and Rizwana Dewan were invited to judge the cookery contest in which 12 women brought novel dishes made by them at home. There were three categories — sweet, namkeen and carving.
 
 Anchor Renuka Deshkar interviewed the celebrity chef as he cooked ‘poha’. As he poured oil in the pan and fried onions, Manohar attributed his record to the collective support provided to him by family, friends and citizens of the city. 
 
 “I wanted to be an actor. But after joining Pune Film Institute, I realized I’m not going to pass out of the college as a big shot actor. I knew I would make it big in catering within those five years,” he said, adding that he always desired to be a known name in the society.
 
 He later discovered his prowess in speech and fashioned himself toward television cookery shows. He also spoke about his new film as an actor titled ‘Once More’ which will be released in September.
