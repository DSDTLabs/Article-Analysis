New Delhi:   were on a lookout for a six-year-old girl after she escaped with a bag containing over Rs 1 lakh  , which her mother and grandmother had   from a woman’s bag in east Delhi’s Shahdara on Monday evening. Cops said that they were both arrested later while the girl has been taken to her relatives’ house.

 Police said a PCR call was made by a local in the market, who was alerted by the victim, Sunita (58). She told police that she was buying a few things from the market after which she had to go to a bank to deposit the cash.
 
 As soon as she came out of a store, she felt that her bag weighed lighter. When she checked, the bag containing cash could not be found. The woman panicked and raised an alarm, alerting other passersby, who then informed the cops.
 
 She suspected two women who were behaving weirdly and she caught hold of them with the help of people nearby. At first, they refused to accept they had stolen anything, but later confessed that they were involved. During interrogation, they told the cops about the girl who had run away with the bag containing cash.
 
 While the cops were busy catching the two women, the girl had sneaked out with the bag. It was finally recovered after CCTV footage was scanned. The girl said that she was taught how to escape with stolen items by her mother.
 
 She had even tried to mislead the cops by giving them wrong leads, but the bag was finally recovered from a vegetable vendor.
