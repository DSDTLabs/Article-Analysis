AHMEDABAD: Cyber Crime sleuths of the city crime branch on Friday arrested two 19-year-old youths   and   of Mevat in   for allegedly cheating banks by withdrawing money from different ATMs in such a way that transaction entry did not reflect on record.

 Cyber Crime sleuths claimed that during interrogation of the accused it came to light that two used to switch of the ATM machine as soon as the money landed in the tray.
 
  “The technique disabled the machine and the transaction did not reflect in the bank entry. We have found about 17 debit cards of different banks from the accused along with two cell phones and two bank pass books” said inspector   of Cyber Cell.
 
 Inspector Gaddam added that the two were arrested from Narol on a tip off on Friday. ‘They were in the city for more than two months. We suspect that they could be involved in more such crimes” said Gaddam.
 
 Crime branch officials said the two who work as drivers in Mevat used take debit cards on rent of Rs 1,000 on rent from the holders. “We are in the process of identifying the card holders who rented their cards to the accused” added a senior cyber cell official.
 
 Crime branch officials said during interrogation the two accused confessed before them that after withdrawing money from the bank, they used to call on the customer care number mentioned on the back of the card and claim that there transaction did not result in withdrawal money.
 
 ‘The card holder’s bank in turn would inform the bank in whose ATM center the transaction was made about the error. The ATM bank would then return the money to the card holder’s bank according to the laid down procedure and money got deposited in the card holder’s account,” added inspector Geddam.
