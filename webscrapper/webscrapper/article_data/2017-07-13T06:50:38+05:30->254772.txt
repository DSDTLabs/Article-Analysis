LUCKNOW: The   has been disappointing for  . With government curtailing the   and  , there are no incentives for the meritorious and poor students. The state government has also deprived the underprivileged secondary school students of free uniforms, books, shoes and bags, a first-of-its-kind promise made in its manifesto.

 The Aditya Nath Yogi-led government had announced distribution of textbooks, bags, uniforms and shoes to students in government-run secondary schools. Earlier, free uniforms, textbooks and bags were limited to students of class 1 to 8. Going by the figures, there are 4.48 lakh students studying in government schools. Add to this the number of students in government-aided schools and this figure stands at 40.06 lakh. 
 
 Officials said the proposed cost of school bag, uniform, textbooks and a pair of shoes is Rs 150, Rs 1,000, Rs 908 and Rs 500 per child respectively. In all, the government would have to spend Rs 2,558 per child to meet the expenses incurred. Had the scheme rolled out, the government would have needed a budgetary provision of Rs 1,024.75 crore, including kids of both government and aided schools. If only kids of government schools were taken into account, the total expenditure would have been Rs 114.82 crore. 
 
 “No budgetary allocation for laptops and free uniforms, books and bags for secondary school kids is unfortuate. With almost all major schemes being scrapped, secondary education seems to be the worst hit,’’ said a government official unwilling to be named. He added that both the   and free uniform, books and bags scheme was state-centric, there was no possibility of financial assistance. “The government saved close to Rs 1,500 crore from secondary education and diverted it to other departments,” he said.
