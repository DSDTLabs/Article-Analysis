GHAZIABAD: The Federation of Apartment Owners Associations,  , is up in arms against Ghaziabad Development Authority’s plan to impose a user charge of Rs 100 on each flat owner per month for outsourcing trash collection to a private contractor in the residential area.

 The federation, in a letter to   on Friday, stated that as many as 50 residential welfare associations have decided that they would not pay the charges.
 
 The initiative was taken by the GDA after complaints regarding frequent burning of municipal solid waste dumped in vacant plots of the area.
 
 Gajendra Arya, president, FAOA, Rajnagar Extension, said, “The GDA has already taken crores of rupees from residents in the form of external development charges, but even after that the work for constructing internal roads is incomplete. Charging user fee from residents is an illegal act in view of builders’ as well as GDA’s failure to allocate a proper place for disposing of garbage. It is builders, not residents who are dumping garbage on vacant plots.”
 
 “While taking the decision on imposing the user charge, the GDA did not take the AOAs into confidence. The builders, who do not have to give any money from their own pocket, readily agreed to the GDA’s proposal. The authority should have included a delegation of the federation in the decision-making process,” added  , general secretary of the federation.
 
 RP Singh, executive engineer, GDA, said, “The service is being launched for the residents, and for that, they will need to pay the charge. We have floated tenders for inviting private contractors.”
 
 GDA officials said that the project will be limited to the lifting of garbage from roads and open spaces only and the private builders would continue to collect and dispose garbage from high-rise buildings on their own for which flat owners pay a maintenance fee.
