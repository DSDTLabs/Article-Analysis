GHAZIABAD: Seven teenagers were robbed of their cellphones, wallets and a video camera at gunpoint in a busy and upscale area outside Swarn Jayanti Park near   in the daytime on Saturday.

 The 17-year-old boys were returning after celebrating the birthday party of one of them and had stopped to make a video clip and click some pictures. They have been identified as Aashwal Chaudhary, Richik Roy, Anirban Chakraborty, Sunny Saxena, Anmol Sharma, Karan Chauhan and Prakar Joshan. The teenagers, who were on three scooters, tried to chase the miscreants, one of whom had a pistol, for a distance before they vanished.
 
 The youths complained that two of the four miscreants were on a red and blue Pulsar bike and had been watching them for a long time from a distance. They also claimed that a PCR vehicle was parked near their location and the boys were attacked almost immediately after it left.
 
 “We were a group of seven and we were using my friend Aashwal’s video camera to make a fun video clip of all of us and the surroundings. We were clicking pictures when suddenly one of the accused came towards us and snatched the camera from Aashwal’s hand,” said Richik, a resident of ATS Advantage. “He started engaging us in a conversation when his accomplice came from behind and loaded a pistol under our nose and asked us to pull out our wallets and cellphones,” Richik said.
 
 “We have written a complaint in this matter and are preparing an FIR,” said Pradeep Tripathi, SHO of   police station.
