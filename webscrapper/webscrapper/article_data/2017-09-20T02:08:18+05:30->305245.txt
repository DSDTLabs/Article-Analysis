MUMBAI:   of prisons   on Tuesday   of being involved in the death of convict   Shetye in Byculla women’s jail. 

 Sathe submitted a reply before the magistrate’s court after a lawyer had sought narco-analysis and brainmappi-ng tests, call data records and voice analysis on her, JJ Hospital dean Dr T P Lahane, police chief Datta Padsalgikar and   superintendent Chandramani Indulkar among others. On June 23, six prison staffers allegedly beat up Shetye, causing 16 contusi-ons. Nagpada police, on June 24, registered an FIR after the post-mortem report revealed contusions as cause of death. 
 
 In her reply, Sathe said Byculla jail didn’t fall under her jurisdiction. “I deny that I des-troyed ...tampered with the evidence of unnatural offence (stick) as alleged,” she said. “The prison staff was upset by the media trial hence, as an officer of the state, I assured... an impartial inquiry...and the same was posted on an informal (WhatsApp) group of officers requesting their support.” She denied she had asked Lahane to prepare a false post-mortem report.
