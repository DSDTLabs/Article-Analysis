Generally, several filmmakers claim that their film is different, but Nanjundi Kaayana, produced by   R under the Sri Rama Talkies banner, addresses a topic that hasn’t been seen much in Indian films. The movie, which stars Tanush Shivanna,   and  , deals with a gay wedding. When we asked director  , who has even acted in the film, why audience must watch his film today, he has not one or two, but many reasons to give.

 “The story line of Nanjundi Kalyana is extremely fresh. It is a film for the youth and the subject is extremely relevant to 2018. Yes, it is about gay marriage and relationships, but we have handled it in a light manner. We lead stressful lives, and to watch a comforting, entertaining story, with a little naughtiness and fun thrown in for good measure, can prove to be one of the biggest stress busters. Unlike other comedy films, the artistes in Nanjundi Kalyana are all from the theatre background, and for most of them, this is their first film. From start to end, everything about the film is new, from the story to the characters and the plot. There are several twists and turns that you wouldn’t expect. The dialogues and scenes are such that you won’t feel like you’ve heard such dialogues or watched such scenes before. The songs are, of course, also one to look out for. All this makes it a complete value-for-money film,” says Rajendra.
