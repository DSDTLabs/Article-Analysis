LUCKNOW: Recent photo ops of   and   together notwithstanding, the   patriarch will not campaign for party candidates in   bypolls. 

 Akhilesh, who replaced his father as SP chief after a bitter battle in the run-up to 2017 assembly polls, will address public meetings after Holi.
 
 Akhilesh is slated to address at least two public meeting each in Phulpur and Gorakhpur after Holi. "Senior party leaders have already started campaigning in both constituencies and our national president will address public meetings in the next few days," said SP national spokesperson and former minister  .
 
 As per the programme finalized so far, the SP chief will address at least two public meetings in each constituency. Chaudhary said he had no information whatsoever if   will campaign or not.
 
 Mulayam loyalists in SP said that the veteran politician never campaigned for bypolls even when he was at the helm of the party.
 
 "As per Netaji's schedule on date, there is no plan of campaigning for bypolls," said a senior SP leader close to Mulayam. "Netaji has rarely campaigned in bypolls and whenever he did, it was because of his close relations with the candidate," said a close aide of Mulayam, adding that in last assembly elections, he held public meetings for his daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav and two friends in fray. 
 
 Though Mulayam had stayed away from campaigning in 2017 assembly elections, held amidst family feud within Yadav clan, there were speculations that the veteran politician may address rallies for Lok Sabha bypolls since Mulayam and Akhilesh made three public appearances together in last five months, including the one at party headquarters in November 2017. 
 
 Father-son bonhomie was once again on display in January when the two attended an event to mark the death anniversary of socialist leader Janeshwar Misra.
