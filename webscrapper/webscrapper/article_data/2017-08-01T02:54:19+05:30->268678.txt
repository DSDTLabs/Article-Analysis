NEW DELHI: A man was arrested on the charge of entering the house of an   and touching his wife inappropriately. 

 In her complaint, the woman told the police that she was suspicious of the man’s intentions and had warned him earlier. 
 
 On July 20, the man allegedly entered the house on the pretext of delivering milk and curd and touched the woman’s hand. 
 
 Startled, she stepped back but the man tried to come in through the door too. She tried to shut the door abruptly and ended up hitting the leg of the man. That didn’t stop him and he managed to enter. 
 
 The woman picked up her phone and rushed to the bathroom where she locked herself in. She then called up her husband and then raised an alarm. But since the neighbours were away, her pleas for help fell on deaf ears. 
 
 The milkman kept on asking her to step out. He first said he wanted to use the bathroom, then he said he needed a glass of water. 
 
 After some time, the man left and the woman came out. But a little later, she saw him outside the window once again. This time, he said he had misplaced some record and thought had left inside the house. 
 
 By this time, the woman’s husband came and the milkman fled. The couple went to the   station to file a complaint. A case was filed and the man was arrested.
