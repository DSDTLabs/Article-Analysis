VADODARA:   police arrested on Tuesday an auto rickshaw driver and his accomplice, who used to target senior citizens for robbing them of cash.

 
 
 Police said that the accused auto-rickshaw driver   Pathan and his friend Arbaz Pathan, both of whom are from  , were on the run since quite some time. A police official said that in past few months they had targeted two elderly men and had stolen Rs 7,000 and Rs 4,000 cash from them.
 
 According to police, besides those two incidents, on May 12, the accused targeted 62-year-old Chiman Mali, who lives at   village in Padra taluka. When Mali was walking towards Jaspur Chowkdi in Padra town, the duo approached him with an offer to drop him in the auto-rickshaw. Police said that since it was very hot, Mali accepted the lift but Arbaz, who was sitting beside Mali, took away Rs 2,000 from his shirt pocket. When Mali insisted on stopping the auto-rickshaw, Kalim Khan drove rashly due to which the auto-rickshaw overturned.
 
 The duo left Mali there in injured condition and fled from there. However, some persons from the crowd which had gathered there noticed the number of the auto-rickshaw and informed the police. Cops tracked down the duo on the basis of the registration number of the vehicle.
 
 “They used to offer lift to senior citizens and take away their money. When the victim would retaliate, they would stop the auto-rickshaw, push him out and escape,” said D M Vyas, police inspector, Padra police station.
