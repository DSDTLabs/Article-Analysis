MARGAO: With the January 15 deadline set by the high court for the occupants of the building declared “unsafe” by the   municipality to vacate having lapsed, the civic body has now given a week’s time for the traders to shift their goods to the temporary rehabilitation provided. 

 Chief officer of the   ( ),  , told TOI strict legal action would be taken against those failing to vacate the premises within a week. 
 
 Forty-two occupants of the building will be accommodated at the GSUDA market complex as a temporary rehabilitation, until the new building is constructed. 
 
 The court had ordered traders to vacate the premises by January 15 while disposing of the petition filed by a section of them contesting the municipality’s claim that the building was unsafe and thus, needed to be razed. The CCMC had, in September last year, issued evacuation notices to the traders occupying the building. The civic body plans to demolish the building to facilitate construction of a new market complex in which the affected traders will also be rehabilitated. The traders had, however, rejected the plan, demanding equal space in the proposed new building as they occupy in the old one.
 
 The high court, in its order, had stated, “Every request for obtaining an exactly equivalent area for the premises in the same location may not be feasible... If the petitioners wish to participate in this process, it cannot be in this one-sided manner where they, as lessees or tenants, virtually get to dictate terms as if they were owners,” the order read.
