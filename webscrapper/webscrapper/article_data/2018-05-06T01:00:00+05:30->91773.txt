GAYA: Much to the relief of foreign monasteries situated in Bodh  , the allegations of commercial use of their guesthouses and business activity inside the monastery premises have been found to be false.

 The state commercial taxes department, which conducted an inquiry into the allegations, did not come across any evidence suggesting commercial use of the guesthouses and other facilities. The probe findings were put up before a review meet chaired by DM   on Friday.
 
 According to an official release, the commercial taxes department officials informed the DM at the meeting that the monasteries offered hospitality to their donors and benefactors, and no tariff was charged for the purpose.
 
 According to   chairman  , certain vested interests had launched a sinister campaign against the foreign monasteries. “Such activities may prove counterproductive and dent the country’s image abroad,” said Pragya Deep.
 
 The DM was also informed that the compliance of the monasteries in respect of Form C requirements was satisfactory. Form C, as per the Foreigners Act, is to be submitted online by hotels, guesthouses and other hosts of the foreign nationals giving details including name, nationality, address, passport and visa details, purpose of visit and duration of stay, among others. 
 
 The DM directed officials to keep a vigil on visitors, particularly foreigners, to Bodh Gaya. He also asked   officials to regularise the constructions made by the monasteries in violation of the building laws after realizing penalty from them as per norms.
 
 The Bodh Gaya circle officer has been directed to ensure new buildings do not come up without proper map approval by the competent authority.
