Nagpur: A decade-old love marriage ended on a tragic note when a 35-year-old man murdered his wife doubting her character at Takalghat in the early hours of Thursday. The man Ramkrushna Dayre later walked into MIDC Bori police station and confessed to have throttled to death his wife Mrunali (34) using a towel at about 4am. After committing the crime, Ramkrushna slept beside the body of his wife along with their twin kids for an hour. Waking up shortly before the daybreak, Ramkrushna took the twins to his mother’s place a few kilometres away, also in Takalghat, before opting to surrender before the police. Ramkrushna’s suspicion about Mrunali having extramarital affair had led to frequent altercations between them. During interrogation, Ramkrushna claimed he and Mrunali had a verbal duel on Wednesday evening during which he had cast aspersions on her character. In a fit of rage, he used a towel to strangulate her while she was sleeping. The couple had three children, including twins (a boy and a girl) aged around one year. The elder son, aged about nine years, stays with a relative for the last several years as the parents were unable to sustain the family expenses. Sources claimed Ramkrushna, addicted to gambling and alcohol, was unemployed. He was dependent on wife’s income and help from the in-laws. Mrunali worked in a private company in MIDC. A family source claimed Ramkrushna used to mentally and physically torture Mrunali for money. “The plot on which the couple stayed was gifted by Mrunali’s family,” he said. “Whenever Ramkrushna would need money he would thrash Mrunali compelling her to seek monetary assistance from her family,” the source said. Senior PI Madhukar Gite of MIDC Bori police station said the court has been requested for a remand up to March 31. “We have recovered the towel with which Ramkrushna had strangled his wife. Rest of the evidences required for the investigation too have been mostly seized,” he said.
