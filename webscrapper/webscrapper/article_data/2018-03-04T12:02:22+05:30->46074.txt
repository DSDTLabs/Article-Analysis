  BJP is doing well in all states and   is no exception. People are responding to Prime Minister   policies and concern for NE's development. BJP has become the most acceptable party all over the country. BJP is a political party not a religion-based party. 
 
  
 
  Development is important as the state desperately needs that. At the same time, solution to the protracted Naga problem is also a pressing issue. 
 
  
 
 
  Yes, there was a boycott given demanding solution first. But that changed as it is election for solution. There are issues which the Centre and Naga groups will thrash out. 
 
  
 
 
  It was during my time as chief minister, the Nagaland assembly passed a unanimous resolution on integration of Naga-contiguous areas. Today, the situation is changing. So, it depends on the negotiating parties how to find an amicable solution. You know the Nagas are spread across four states. And a big group is in  . So, this has become a chronic problem. It is not only a Naga problem, it is a national problem that needs to be resolved. 
 
  
 
 
  We have to provide good governance and transparency. We have to bring development because our communication and road connectivity infrastructure is very poor. So, these are the immediate requirements. We don't have an airport in  . Construction of railway lines is going at snails's pace. We will take all these into consideration .
