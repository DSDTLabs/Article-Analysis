MADURAI: With a view to ensuring safety of commuters and bringing down the number of criminal cases, the city police have planned to install surveillance   at important points in the city.

 Once completed, nearly 400   cameras will become functional at the vantage points, providing round-the-clock surveillance of the city. Besides keeping an eye on the traffic rule offenders, the effort is expected to curb the increasing number of theft, burglaries and snatchings incidents.
 
 “We are planning to install 300 to 400 CCTV cameras at vantage points covering the entire city. A proposal for the procurement of camera has been sent. We will connect the cameras with the control room to make the job easier for us,” said city police commissioner  .
 
 The commissioner said that at present roughly 50 percent of the traffic signals have been installed with  . Cameras were installed at six to seven traffic signals in the last one week alone. 
 
 “It is helpful in detecting various crimes. It has helped to detect an accused involved in series of crime incidents recently. More than 100 sovereigns of gold jewels were recovered from the accused,” he said.
 
 Police said that the cameras, which could also double up as a deterrent, will give security cover on the entry and exit roads to the city. 
 
 Arrest of a criminal was an effective way of preventing crimes as the man, left free, would go on carrying out the same offence again, the police said.
 
 With the government making it mandatory to install CCTVs, the city already has more than 3,000 cameras in the public places, financial institutions and private places, where people gather.
 
 The city police are also encouraging residential associations to install CCTV cameras in a bid to involve residents in crime prevention. “We have talking with the public for their support in crime prevention. There has been a good support from the residents,” said
