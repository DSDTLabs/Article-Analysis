PANAJI: With Goa Forward Party’s election campaign coming to a close, senior leader   launched a tirade against   president Luizinho Faleiro and squarely blamed him for the failure of the GFP-Congress alliance.

 “People like Luizinho Faleiro are allergic to Goans and are scared of the rise of regional parties in the state. His own party spokesperson is stating the pradesh committee president has done a setting with   and that speaks volume. They are supporting independent candidates in constituencies where we are contesting, all at the behest of Luzinho Faleiro,” Fatorda MLA Sardesai said, adding that Congress’ decision to not form an alliance with secular parties show they are the divisive force. 
 
 Sardesai further alleged a secret dealing between the two national parties. “A case of cheating against Faleiro’s wife was withdrawn. Both parties are working in Fatorda to bring Damu Naik to power,” Sardesai said, stating the demand for special status rose only after the SEZ scam during the Congress regime. The regional party has said it is supporting Navelim independent candidate Cipru Cardozo, claiming he is a true son of the soil.
