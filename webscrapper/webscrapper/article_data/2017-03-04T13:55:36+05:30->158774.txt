PONDA: In a bid to ease traffic congestion across the town, the   (PMC) has began relocating   and   operating near the government offices complex at Tisk.

 PMC chief officer (CO)   said the civic body already removed two food kiosks and some encroachments along footpaths in the area on Friday. “The encroachments and kiosks were found to be obstructing smooth flow of traffic because their customers would park their vehicles along the road,” Naik said.
 
 The kiosks and fish vendors displaced from the Tisk junction are likely to be temporarily rehabilitated in an open space near the government offices complex until permanent arrangements are made.
