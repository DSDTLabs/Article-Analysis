NAGPUR: The bandh called by the banned outfit of   (Maoist) on Friday in eastern Vidarbhaâ€™s Gadchiroli and Gondia, the two most affected districts of the state, turned out to be a damp squib with life remaining normal. 

 Though some parts of neighbouring   was tense and affected after the recovery of explosives, there were no signs of a bandh in Maharashtra. The  , who had damaged roads with mines at two places in Chhattisgarh, remained underground in Gadchiroli due to heavy security bandobast by the cops who were taking no chances. 
 
 Police were extra cautious after posters and pamphlets of Maoists threatening them of revenge action for the encounters on April 22 and 23 were found at different places in Gadchiroli. Forty Maoists were killed over those two days.
 
 In the past couple of years too the Maoists had failed to elicit much response from the masses or even perpetrate much damage on government properties and forces in Maharashtra. On Friday, trade and transport across Gadchiroli and Gondia remained unaffected.
 
 The encounter on the banks of Indravati river at the forests adjoining Rela-Kasnasur-Boriya on April 21, where police had claimed to have gunned down at least 34 Maoist cadres and recovered substantial arms and weapons, has been an unprecedented success against the reds by any security forces in the nation engaged in the hinterlands. 
 
 DIG Naxal range (Gadchiroli and Gondia) Ankush Shinde said strategic bandobast plan and deployments ensured no untoward incident. 
 
 Despite the relief, cops are likely to have another tense day on Saturday as a team of human right activists are likely to land up in the district to probe into the encounter killings which have already triggered controversies.
