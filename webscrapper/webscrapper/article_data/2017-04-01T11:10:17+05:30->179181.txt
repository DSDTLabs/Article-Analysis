AHMEDABAD: Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been pressing for the inclusion of   into the mainstream by creating a support system for them — he even coined the term ‘Divyang’ — Gujarat has shown   for disabled people.

 The CAG report highlighted the fact that the state government did not start a single Special Employment Exchange (SEE) as stipulated by law. There are 40 SEEs across the country, but not a single one in Gujarat. The government has not introduced any scheme for unemployment allowance.
 
 The CAG report has exposed irregularities in paying pensions and scholarships to eligible people and the state authorities have been accused of denying requests of disabled people for entitlements. The government, which stresses on the digital mode of payment, failed to deposit money in bank accounts of beneficiaries and sent money through postal orders.
 
 The audit revealed that the state government did not complete the survey after covering 3,48,907 disabled people in 139 of 249 talukas. During the audit period, the state government did not maintain a comprehensive database. This led to ineffective formulation and implementation of the scheme. The department concerned did not prepare any action plan for the implementation of   for disabled people, and targets to benefit them were fixed without considering actual number of   in the state.
