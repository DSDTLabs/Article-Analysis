MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday dismissed cases filed against the appointment of   (Coimbatore) dean A Edwin   as director of medical education ( ). 
 
 The division bench headed by justice T S   had on Monday last reserved its order on a batch of pleas including a contempt case filed by the dean of Government Medical College ( ), S Revwathy and dean of Government Medical College (Thiruvarur), A L  . 
  
 The petitioners counsels told the bench that the single judge had on September 20 last set aside a government order appointing Joe as DME. 
  
 When appeals were preferred against the single judge order, the division bench also set aside that government order by observing that the government positively recommended Joe to the post of DME and directed it to consider the promotion issue afresh. But, the government went to the Supreme Court against the high court order, but was not interested in continuing the case. It withdrew its case by saying that it did not want to press the case. Now, it appointed the same person (Edwin Joe) as DME, the counsels said. 
  
 The government told the court that it again examined the merit and ability of the five medical officers in the light of the orders of the court and found that Joe is having more merit and ability.
