Panaji: Preparations for the   are on in full swing with prominent locations in the city already decked up with vibrant décor. The festival, a quasi-local equivalent along the lines of the carnival will be held here on March 18. This year, however, the colourful parade will not be followed by the usual prize distribution function. Winners will instead be asked to collect their awards from GTDC.

 “Last year, the parade went on till very late in the night, blocking roads and inconveniencing citizens. This year, it will be a disciplined parade therefore, and the floats will wind up by 9.30 pm. The results will be announced, but winners will have to collect their prizes from the department of tourism,” said Keshav Nadkarni, executive committee member of Panaji Shigmotsav Samiti.
 
 Three senior artistes, who are usually felicitated during the prize distribution ceremony, will be honoured this year as well at a function scheduled for March 19 at Azad Maidan.
