Indian politicians often use poetry in Parliament sessions to shut the opposition, and when they do so, they are often greeted with thunderous applause.  , who has been a careful observer of these poetic barbs, feels that poetry should be taught in schools. Prasoon, who was recently in Delhi to attend a session of  , a festival that celebrates Urdu, said, "Shaayari toh aap ko jeene ki tehzeeb sikhaati hai, isliye jab kuch nahin kehne ko reh jata toh politicians bhi Parliament mein jaa kar   hi karte hain. Kuch nahin reh jaata toh lagta hai, shaayar ka sahara liya jaye." The lyricist added, "Schools should include it in their curricula, teach its correct pronunciation, make people understand its grammar. Aur achha sunne ko milega humein, aisi ulti-seedhi shaayari sunne ko nahin milegi."

  Poems are not just a politician's tool, he said adding, "When I was doing MBA, I used to hear the speeches of management gurus who would often quote from literature. It should be part of syllabii because it is giving you an eye for life, a realisation. Usko padhaaiye, usko dil se padhaaiye. Kinaara kyun karte hain hum log? Parents often say it should be taught at home, but why? Why not in schools?"
 
  On popular demand, the lyricist recited a few lines from his song Maa from Taare Zameen Par. He shared, "There are these lines in the song – Jab bhi kabhi papa mujhe zor zor se jhoola jhulate hain maa, meri nazar dhoondhe tujhe, sochoon yahi tu aa ke thaamegi maa... After listening to this song many fathers told me – 'Hum itne zor zor se jhoola nahin jhulate.' I got many letters from fathers saying, 'You are not being kind to fathers.' That made me think – 'Maa ki tareef karte karte pata nahin kab main pita ke viruddh ho gaya?'"
 
  Following this, he recited one of his poems dedicated to fathers – "Kya pita ka dosh pita hona hai? Ya phir purush hona, ya samarth hona?"
