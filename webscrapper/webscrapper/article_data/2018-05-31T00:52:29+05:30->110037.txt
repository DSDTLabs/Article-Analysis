MUMBAI: Depite BJP’s high-powered campaign, led by CM  , it will be an uphill task for the party to retain   and   Lok Sabha seats in view of the stron Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP nominees in the fray. Election in Palghar was necessitated following the death of   Lok Sabha member Chintaman Wanga, while in Bhandara-Gondia, owing to the resignation of BJP’s Nana Patole, who later joined the Congress.

 
 State Congress president   said it will not be a cakewalk for the BJP in view of dismal performance of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government. “Results of both Palghar and Bhandara-Gondia will surprise all. There was lack of transparency in the polling...it has raised a question mark over the credibility of the election commission. Despite identical complaints, while there was re-polling in Bhandara-Gondia, the ECI granted a clean chit to the Palghar returning officer. There was large-scale failure and malfunctioning of electronic voting machines in both constituencies,” Chavan told TOI.
 
  are usually insignificant, but the unexpected entry of Shiv Sena nominee Avinash Wanga led the BJP to field Rajendra Gavit, who defected from the Congress, and Congress to nominate former MP Damu Shingda in Palghar. An alliance between the Congress and the NCP in Bhandara-Gondia changed the political scenario there. The BJP nominated Hemant Patle and Congress-NCP Madhukar Kukade.
