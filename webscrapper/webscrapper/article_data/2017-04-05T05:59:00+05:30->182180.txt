Nagpur: The Central Railway has eliminated all 216 unmanned level crossings on its broad gauge network. This makes it the first zone across India to achieve this feat.

 Official sources said that in 2011 the five divisions of Central Railway — Mumbai, Nagpur, Pune, Solapur and Bhusawal — had 216 unmanned railway crossings. “In the last six years, all the unmanned crossings have been eliminated by systematic planning, by providing alternatives like road over bridges (ROBs), subway, road under bridges (RUBs), diversions and by way of manning. Thus, Central Railway has become the first zone across Indian Railways to eliminate all unmanned crossings,” claimed officials.
 
 They further said that in lieu of 216 unmanned level crossings, the Central Railway had provided 1 ROB, 113 RUBs and subways, 46 diversions and 54 crossings are now manned. Two level crossings were closed due to low traffic.
 
 Railway minister Suresh Prabhu has announced that his government will eliminate all unmanned level crossings on broad gauge lines by 2020 and expert international assistance will be harnessed to improve safety preparedness and maintenance practices as per 2017-18 budget. Unmanned level crossings are a major reason for train accidents. Across the Indian Railways, 1,503 unmanned level crossings were eliminated in 2016-17 fiscal.
