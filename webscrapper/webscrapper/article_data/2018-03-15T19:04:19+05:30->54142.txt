THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As per latest weather forecast, the depression over southeast   is likely to lose steam and the possibility of a cyclone genesis is nil. 

 The signal-3 alert that has been hoisted at all ports and harbours across the state will be withdrawn on Thursday after monitoring the condition. However, fishermen are advised to keep away for the sea on Thursday also. 
 
 Isolated heavy rains are expected to lash parts of Kerala and Lakshadweep till Thursday. 
 
 The   (IMD) and Kerala state disaster management Authority (KSDMA) are closely monitoring the condition. "Now the depression is likely to move towards northwest away from Kerala coast and the probability for further intensification is very low. It is likely to weaken gradually over the southeast and adjoining east-central Arabian Sea after 24 hours," said KSDMA member secretary Sekhar Kuriakose.
 
 S Sudevan, director of   here said, "The depression over southeast Arabian Sea moved north-westwards with a speed of about 14 kmph in the last six hours and is centred over southeast Arabian Sea (340 km west-southwest of Thiruvananthapuram and 380 km north-northeast of Male, Maldives)."
 
 However, even as the depression is weakening, critics have raised concerns over the mode of functioning of IMD in issuing timely forecasts. 
 
 "It is unfortunate that IMD, which has the responsibly of informing about weather changes, is alerted by receiving agencies such as KSDMA to issue depression alert in Kerala," a scientist said.
