MUMBAI: Agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar and food & civil supplies minister Girish Bapat were criticised by the Opposition for proceeding on a 15-day   despite an “agrarian crisis owing to a sudden spurt in farmer suicides” and the tur procurement controversy.

 Leader of the Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil said the cabinet members lacked a sense of responsibility. “Maharashtra is facing the worst-ever crisis on the agriculture front, farmers have launched an agitation for a complete loan waiver, there is a sudden spurt in farmer   and the state government does not have an action plan to resolve the row over tur dal procurement. The cabinet member appears to be non-serious,” Vikhe Patil said.
 
 Fundkar, Bapat and the presiding officers of both houses of the state legislature have embarked on a tour of Australia, Singapore and New Zealand under the banner of the Common Wealth Parliamentary Association, Maharashtra Branch.
 
 At a meeting presided over by legislative council chairman Ramraje Nimbalkar, it was decided to depute a high-level delegation for 15 days to Australia, Singapore and New Zealand for a study tour from May 1. Besides visit to the parliaments, dairy development projects and key infrastructure projects, it was proposed that a MoU would be signed between the state legislature and the parliament of New South Wales, Australia. The cost of Rs 3.5 lakh per person would be borne by the association.
 
 CM Devendra Fadnavis, leader of the Opposition in the assembly Vikhe Patil, leader of the Opposition in the council Dhananjay Munde and state NCP chief Sunil Tatkare did not join the tour. Fadnavis said: “It’s a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association tour under the leadership of presiding officers of both the houses. One MoU will be signed in Australia, so Bapat and Fundkar have gone there as nominees of the government.”
