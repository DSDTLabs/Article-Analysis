GAYA: The Union   and the railways will join hands for the development of   station to make it presentable to the visitors from abroad. 

 This was stated by minister of state for railways Manoj Sinha during his visit to inaugurate several new facilities at the station on Thursday afternoon.
 
 The railways, it may be recalled, has announced its commitment to develop Gaya as a model station with all amenities, including escalator, lift, luggage screening facility, CCTV cameras, ticket- vending machine and a state-of-the-art reservation centre. Most of these facilities were to be developed in 2016 itself, but little has been done to maintain the timeline of these schemes.
 
 Sources said though the minister did not make any public comment on the inordinate delay in the execution of the development schemes, he chided officials for lethargy and red tapism.
 
 On Thursday, the minister formally inaugurated the third foot overbridge at the station. He also inaugurated the expanded platform number 8 and 9 to make it compatible with 24-coach passenger trains. He also inaugurated deluxe toilet facility at the station.
 
 The minister pressed the remote button to inaugurate the upgraded platform at Dehri-on-Sone station. Like Gaya, Dehri-on-Sone too comes under the Mughalsarai division of the railways.
 
 Much to the disappointment of Gaya rail users, however, the railway minister kept mum on the all-important issue of introduction of new long-distance trains with Gaya as the point of origin, increase in the frequency of trains and introduction/hike in Gaya quota in trains like the four pairs of   (Kolkata Rajdhani, Sealdah Rajdhani, Ranchi Rajdhani and Bhubaneswar Rajdhani) trains passing through Gaya.
 
 Local people are also unhappy as Gaya has been made a technical halt for Duranto Express. Except for VIPs like MPs, ordinary passengers cannot board   at Gaya.
