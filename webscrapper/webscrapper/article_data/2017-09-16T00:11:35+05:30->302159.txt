MUMBAI: The Congress plans to stage demonstrations outside 60 fuel pumps across the city on Tuesday to protest against high prices of petrol and diesel that Mumbaikars have to pay.

 City Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam said that petrol costs Rs 79.54 per litre in the city, diesel stands at Rs 62.46 per litre. “We have studied petrol and diesel prices in major cities in India. Prices in Mumbai are the highest. While prices of petroleum products are on the decline across the world, in Mumbai, the hike is spiralling owing to massive taxes,” Nirupam said.
 
 Nirupam pointed out that there was 58% tax on petrol and 50% on diesel. He said that during the Congress regime, it was 34% and 21.5% respectively. “If Prime Minister Narendra Modi is serious about tackling the plight of common people, he should immediately bring petroleum products under the Goods and Services Tax regime,” he said . 
 
 The Congress has demanded that if petroleum products were brought under the ambit of GST, then the maximum tax would be 28%. “Prices of petroleum products will reduce drastically. Petrol will cost Rs 55 to Rs 60 per litre,’’ Nirupam said. TOI on September 14 reported that the government would not go back on reforms in the fuel retail market and the daily revision of prices introduced on June 16 will continue. Petrol retail prices have risen by almost Rs 7 since July to return to the same levels as they were in April 2014, even as crude prices have almost halved since three years ago. “Excise duty on petrol was Rs 9.2 per litre in 2014 when the Congress was in power. Under NDA rule in August 2017, it was increased to Rs 21.48 per litre,” Nirupam said . “Modi must bring all petroleum products under the GST regime,’’ he said. He expressed surprise over the continuation of special cess of Rs 11 per litre on petrol to tackle drought. “Since there is no drought in major parts of the  , the CM should withdraw the cess.”
