MUMBAI: Of the five lakh conventional electricity meters in the island city, a significant number have developed 'errors' and are running 'slow', bleeding the BEST undertaking of revenue.

  This was disclosed at the BEST committee meeting on Tuesday, causing furore among members across political parties. The BEST announced it would replace one lakh such meters in the first phase with digitally advanced gadgets at a cost of Rs 6.7 crore within the next six months. Most new installations will be in SoBo areas, a senior official said. 
 
  member Ravi Raja said, "This means revenue to the tune of crores of rupees may have been lost in the past few years due to errors in existing meters which were running slow."
 
  A senior BEST official, present at the meeting, admitted some of the meters were old, had completed nearly five years and there were 'errors' which slowed down the machines. "We are replacing all these meters gradually. The one lakh new electronic meters will be installed in phases," he said.
 
  Commenting on the digital meters, an official from the BEST management said, "It will ensure accuracy in meter reading for the next seven years. These meters will also help us download data and show consumption patterns and peak load for any period."
 
 BEST officials, however, refused to comment on the losses or peg a figure.
 
  On Tuesday, BEST also announced a Rs 104-crore power supply project to introduce new cables and sub-stations in the island city. 
 
  Under the Integrated Power Development Scheme, BEST will receive Rs 63 crore as subsidy from the Centre while it will spend Rs 41 crore from its kitty.
 
  "Upgradation of power supply systems will ensure outages are minimised and there are near-zero disruptions arising out of cable faults," a senior official from the power supply wing said. Under the scheme, the BEST will spend Rs 13 crore on remote meter reading system.
