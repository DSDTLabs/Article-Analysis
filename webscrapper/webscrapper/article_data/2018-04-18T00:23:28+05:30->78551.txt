NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police has filed a chargesheet against four students of Delhi University for allegedly driving under influence,   and intension to insult the modesty of Union minister   in 2017.

 The police filed its chargesheet before metropolitan magistrate Snigdha Sarwaria under IPC sections 354D (stalking), 509 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), and Section 185 (driving under influence) of the Motor Vehicles Act.
 
 The court put up the matter for scrutinising the documents on October 15. “Considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case, there is sufficient material on record to issue summons against the accused Sitanshu, Karan, Avinash and Amit,” the court said, and extended the interim bail granted to them till the next date of hearing.
 
 It is alleged that the four men gesticulated in a lewd fashion, trying to bring their car as parallelly close to   as possible. “I instructed my driver to start the siren and red light atop my vehicle, hoping the gentlemen would seek to halt/cease their acts of lewd behaviour and intimidation. Since they persisted in their action, I dialled 100 to report their activities while also looking out for a policeman or police vehicle stationed on the road to attract their attention and seek help,” Irani’s complaint alleges.
 
 In April 2017, the police had alleged that the four drunk students had followed Irani's car in Lutyens’ Delhi, following which they were detained and subsequently arrested.
