Surat: The Surat Diamond Association ( ) has started reconciliation efforts with the diamond maker who defaulted on payments to the tune of Rs 100 crore belonging to over 50 merchants last week. 

 Industry sources said that the defaulter was running a diamond factory at Nandu Doshi Ni Wadi at Katargam for the past few years. In the past few months, the defaulter had purchased rough diamonds and polished diamonds to the tune of Rs 100 crore, including Rs 30 crore worth of rough diamonds purchased on credit from a Gujarati diamantaire in Antwerp.
 
 The SDA has warned trade members to be vigilant over defaulters in the coming days and deal with only those who have proper GST registration.
 
 Sources said that the defaulter is hailing from Jamnagar district. The defaulter managed to get all his transactions of rough and polished diamonds on the paper chits. 
 
 SDA office-bearers stated that the defaulter has arrived in the city and that is trying to establish contact with his creditor for settlement. He (defaulter) is willing to pay 25 paise for every Re1, which means that he will pay just Rs 25 crore to his creditors against Rs 100 crore worth of payment dues. Sources said that the industry is all set to face more such default cases in the coming days. The defaulters operating in the market will not take registration under GST and have started fleeing the market. 
 
 “Only genuine diamond merchants and manufacturers will remain in the trade, while the fly-by-night operators will perish post-GST. We have been trying to establish contact with the defaulter, but he is yet to depose in front of our conciliators,” said SDA president Dinesh Navadiya.
