BHUBANESWAR: Former Union home minister  , who spearheaded a protest outside   (RBI) here on Wednesday as part of Congress' nationwide stir against demonetisation, reportedly upset his partymen in Odisha by going soft on chief minister Naveen Patnaik. The CM supported Centre's decision of banning Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. 

 "I cannot comment on Naveen Patnaik. I am not here to speak against Naveen," Shivraj told mediapersons to a question on Naveen supporting demonetisation. But Shivraj, like his colleagues, came down heavily on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Shivraj alleged Modi used RBI like a puppet. 
 
 "It was the poor, who suffered the worst in the aftermath of demonetisation. The RBI has failed to carry out its statutory autonomy and meekly surrendered its independence to Modi. The Centre has failed to bring black money from overseas countries," Shivraj said. 
 
 Unlike Shivraj, Congress leaders here slammed Naveen for supporting Modi over demonetisation. "We will use demonetisation as a major plank in the ensuing panchayat elections. We will sensitise voters against the BJP at the Centre and the BJD in Odisha. The BJD will pay the price in rural polls for supporting BJP in the  ," Congress state president Prasad Harichandan said. Prasad parried when asked about Shivraj's silence on Naveen. Some other Congress leaders said Shivrajl should have vocal against Naveen.
 
 Earlier in the day, a large number of Congress leaders took out a rally from   to RBI and demanded resignation of the Central bank's governor Urjit Patel. "We feel RBI is functioning like a puppet in hands of Modi. Both Modi and RBI keep on changing decisions at their will, affecting the interest of common people," Prasad said. 
 
 The BJP said the Congress is jittery over Centre's crackdown on black money. "The Congress is neck-deep in corruption and promoted black money hoarders," said BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma.
