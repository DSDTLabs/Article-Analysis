KOCHI: The renovation works of   near   is progressing at a snail's pace. Though the work of the entrance gate have begun, most of the rides remain inoperative and unusable by the kids. 

 Although the plan to renovate the park was sanctioned in July 2017, much of the work is yet to be completed and many rides remain shut.
 
 "The park cannot be completely shut for renovation works as it is the vacation season during which children visit the park. That is why full-fledged works haven't begun yet. Only after the vacations are over, we will be able to shut down the park fully for the works. The project is expected to be completed in a year's time," said Shyamalakshmi S, assistant development commissioner general (ADCG) of the park. Even main features of the park such as the musical fountain and mini toy-train remain closed as they need renovation. The plight of the park has led to a decline in the number of visitors, especially during summer holidays. Along with the issue of renovation work, another concern raised by parents is security.
 
 "Schemes have been set up to develop the park in favour of disabled children. Facilities such as ramps, signboards, wheelchairs and equipment made especially for them are the main highlights of the new plan," said Vijay Kumar, DTPC secretary. Mary Anitha, chairman, Centre for Empowerment and Enrichment (CEFEE), an NGO that works with disabled people, suggested that attention should be paid to toilet facilities for the disabled. "Along with these facilities, toilets should be built for special children which are wheelchair-friendly. Sensory equipment including audio-visual aids should be provided for their benefit," she said.
 
 The renovation plans included overhaul of the pool, a new energy park, play items, water theme park, electric cars, computer play areas and go-karting.
