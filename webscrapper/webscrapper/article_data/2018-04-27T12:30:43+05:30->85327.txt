AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad Janmarg Limited has terminated the services of a BRTS driver, who allegedly threatened to run over   municipal councillor  . The councillor had objected to the driver using a mobile phone while driving.

 Officials said that Amarkotiya boarded a   vehicle on route number nine at Maninagar and was heading towards Sola Road, when she saw the driver using the mobile. She immediately told him to stop using the mobile as he was driving.
 
 The driver allegedly misbehaved with the Amarkotiya and told her to complaint where ever she could. After getting off, when Amarkotiya was taking photographs of the driver and bus number, he attempted to obstruct her by speeding up the bus towards her, while she was taking pictures.
 
 The Amarkotiya immediately called   standing committee chairman Pravin Patel and informed him about the incidentPatel said, “I was informed about the incident and photographs of the bus were shared with me. I called up the officials concerned and told them to immediately terminate the driver’s services. The councillor was right, as using a mobile while driving can cause an accident. The driver was rude to her and even attempted to run her over.” Patel said the corporation decided to terminate the driver’s services to set an example.
 
 A senior AMC officer said that they instructed the contractor to ensure that the bus drivers do not use mobile phones when they are driving.
 
 An official said that every month a couple of accidents caused by negligent driving are reported. The officer added that if the driver was so rude to a councillor what his behaviour was with the common public could be imagined.
