 Referring to Modi's speeches in Parliament, Rahul said it was clear he was not interested in answering "fundamental questions". Rahul said defence minister   had first announced she would inform the nation about the cost of the Rafale aircraft but was now saying she could not do so as it was a state secret. "Which of her two statements are correct?" he asked.
 
 Rahul said he had also posed three questions to Modi. These included the aircraft's cost and "handing over" the deal to a businessman after "snatching" it from a public undertaking. However, there was no reply, he added. 
 
 AICC spokesman   charged the PM with political corruption.
