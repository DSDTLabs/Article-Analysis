GAYA: With Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan fielding   from the   for the   on March 9, the BJP-led NDA stands a divided house. Sitting MLC   is the RLSP candidate supported by another NDA partner Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi. 

 More than 14,000 registered teachers of secondary and senior secondary schools and colleges spread over eight districts would vote at 111 polling stations for this council seat.
 
 BJP district chief Anil Swami and HAM-S spokesperson Danish Rizwan said their respective parties were supporting Sanjiv. Political analysts believe HAM-S opposition to the LJP candidate is obvious as both Paswan and Manjhi have been vying for the leadership of Bihar dalits.
 
 RLSP state vice-president Sarfaraz Khan says Sanjiv’s NDA affiliation will not deprive him of a sizeable minority votes. In 2011, the minority votes decisively tilted the scale in his favour and he had won the seat by less than 50 votes. 
 
 Playing down the presence of LJP candidate, Khan said the internal war in the UPA was far more serious. It is grand alliance partners Congress vs RJD. Congress’s Hriday Narain is challenging RJD’s Dinesh Yadav for the same seat.
 
 Like BJP, JD(U) also has not fielded a candidate for the seat. If stories doing the rounds are to be believed, several JD(U) leaders have extended tacit support to the RLSP candidate. Sanjiv has been in the JD(U) and maintains close personal relationship with several important JD(U) functionaries.
