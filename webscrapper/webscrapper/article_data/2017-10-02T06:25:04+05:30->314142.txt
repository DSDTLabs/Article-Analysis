SHIMLA: After his meeting with   vice-president   and Sonia Gandhi’s political secretary Ahmad Patel in New Delhi, it seems that Himachal Pradesh chief minister   has emerged stronger than ever.

 Upon his return on Saturday, the state Congress named Virbhadra loyalist Yashwant Chhajta the president of   district and removed Ritesh Kaprate who is said to be the loyalist of state president Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu.
 
 Sources say that appointment of Yashwant as president of Shimla rural district holds significance as Sukhvinder had earlier appointed Prakash Thakur as president of Shimla rural district after removing Kehar Singh Khachi — another loyalist of Virbhadra Singh.
 
 Sources have also said that during his meeting, Virbhadra Singh had strongly demanded Sukhvinder’s removal from the post of state president. Though his demand was not met but the leaders of his choice are now being appointed in the organization and this process has started with the appointment of Yashwant.
 
 After returning from Delhi, Virbhadra Singh said that his talks with Rahul Gandhi ended in a positive note and the Congress vice-president had acceded to his request to visit the state and address the people at Mandi on October 7. The CM attended the   at Jakhu during the evening hours.
