Music composer   recently revealed the reason behind composing the music for the film  . The composer stated in a press statement, “Today the film industry is going places. Whether it’s going on the right path or not isn’t clear to anyone. In today’s cinema world, a simple story that has a punch of emotions is gradually disappearing. If the film industry doesn't bring stories related to temple, cultural background to remind people of our past, it will become obsolete. Our ancestors did these in order to remind ourselves who we were. Cinema must have stories with good intentions carrying individuality. This film has its mark, so I was interested to compose music for it.

 He added, “A mother would do anything to provide for her child. In this film, the mother does something for her child which no one would dare to do. I have composed a song about mother in this film.”
