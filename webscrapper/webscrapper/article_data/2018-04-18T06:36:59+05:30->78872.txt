CHENNAI: As questions were raised about the   instituting a probe into the case of a woman assistant professor allegedly asking students to offer sexual favours to higher-ups,   governor   on Tuesday defended himself saying he, as the chancellor of the university, had the authority to do so.

 He also denied having met Nirmala Devi, assistant professor of Devanga Arts College in   district (a constituent college of Madurai Kamaraj University), whose purported telephone conversation with four women students has a reference to the governor. She was arrested on Monday after an audio tape of the conversation went viral on Sunday, more than 25 days after the students complained to authorities that the assistant professor tried to lure them into offering sexual favours to some higher-ups in MKU.
 
 “As a chancellor of the university I have powers under sub-section 4(a) of Section 12 of the Madurai Kamaraj University Act, which states that in any emergency which in the opinion of the VC required immediate action, he may take action with the sanction of the chancellor or pro-chancellor as the case may be,” the governor said at a press meet at Raj Bhavan.
 
 On his name being mentioned in the tape, Purohit said, “I categorically deny meeting the woman. During a university convocation many people come on the stage and it is not possible to remember each one. Those on the stage may later claim that they are close to me. All the accusations against me are baseless and nonsense,” said Purohit.
 
 The issue attained a new dimension when the Raj Bhavan ordered a probe by retired IAS officer  , hours after the MKU proposed to constitute a five-member panel to investigate the matter. “The swift action was taken in an unbiased manner so as to ferret out the truth,” the governor said. “There is and there will be no attempt to shield anybody and it shall be ensured that the guilty do not go without punishment.”
