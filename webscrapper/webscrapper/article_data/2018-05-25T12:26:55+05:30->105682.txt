PATNA: In a review meeting, headed by newly appointed IG (prisons and correctional services)   at the city’s Visvesvaraya Bhavan on Thursday, some jail   alleged threat to their lives from inmates and their associates. The meet, which should be held monthly, was organized almost after a year.

 One of the superintendents alleged that whatever confidential information he shared with senior police officials during routine crime meetings was somehow passed on to the inmates.
 
 “The inmates get to know which superintendent had information related to them and he ultimately receives threat calls from their associates,” the superintendent told Mishra who assured that a centralised process for sharing information with police would be created.
 
 The IG informed the superintendents that the prisons department would soon allot 109 new pistols to them. “Ammunition will also be procured from the factory at Khadki in Pune in two months. There will also be facility of watching one sports, news and religious channels across jails in Bihar,” he said.
 
 Mishra also instructed officials to hold timely meetings to avoid attracting the wrath of courts. He said, “Ensure that all CCTV cameras are in working condition. Data related to e-prison and number of inmates must be updated daily and water purifiers installed for inmates in a couple of months.”
