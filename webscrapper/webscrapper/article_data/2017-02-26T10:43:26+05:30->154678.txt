JAIPUR: Villagers of Ramnagar in Ghatti gram panchayat of Kishanganj tehsil of Baran district have no access to safe drinking water for over three months. Villagers — Girdhari, Dhanraj and Karma— told social activist Firoz Khan, who regularly tours these villages, that the tube well and three hand pumps are dysfunctional. There are about 55 families in this village. People are forced to travel about two km to the nearest private tube well to fetch water, which they fill in plastic drums and ferry them back on bikes or bullock carts. 

 Villagers say all household work is halted until water is made available. The matter has been taken to the sarpanch several times, Dhanraj said, but nothing had come of all the complaints made by villagers. People complained that summer is still to arrive and if the water problem is already so acute, they anticipate that the summer would be hard. 
 
 “We are already bathing about only once a week,” Karma said, adding that when drinking water is so hard to come by, a bath is the last thing on mind. 
 
 In nearby Tatabani village, people have taken a motor on hire from a farmer and each family contributes to make a payment to the farmer for using motor, which pumps water from the government tube well. Development officer   said water table in the area was low. “However, wherever there is a problem with tube well or hand pump, we will set it right,” he said.
