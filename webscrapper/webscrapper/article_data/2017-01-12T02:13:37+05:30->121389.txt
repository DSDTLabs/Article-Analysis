BIJNOR: A video in which the   candidate from   constituency of Bijnor, Tasleem Ahmed, is allegedly seen saying, “A neta is not complete unless he illegally grabs the land of at least 50-100 people and ill treats them, or forcefully takes away the belongings of at least 100 people” has gone viral.   has denied charges, claimingthe video to be doctored.

  The video was first circulated on social media on Tuesday evening.
 
  Ahmed was elected as an MLA from Najibabad in the last assembly polls on a   ticket. However, he rebelled against the party brass and was expelled a few months ago and has joined SP. He has now got an SP ticket for the same seat.
 
  “Ahmed is the real face of SP. In the past five years, this is what other leaders of the ruling party did across the state. His statement has reduced the value of democracy. People of UP will teach a lesson to SP in the upcoming elections,” said   state secretary Ashok Kataria.
