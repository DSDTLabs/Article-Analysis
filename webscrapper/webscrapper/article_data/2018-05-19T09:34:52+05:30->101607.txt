BENGALURU:   services are likely to be affected from June 4, with a section of   employees threatening to go on an indefinite strike after talks with the management failed.

 
 The Bangalore   Rail Employees Union (BMREU) has been demanding recognition of the union, salary hike, redressal mechanism and abolishment of the contract labour system. Earlier,   deferred its proposed month-long strike from March 22 after both the staff and management agreed to hold discussions as per the high court’s direction.
 
 Suryanarayana Murthy, vice-president, BMREU, said they conducted multiple rounds of talks with the BMRCL management between March 26 and April 20. “We also placed all our grievances and demands before the management, but there has been no outcome so far. The management also rejected all our demands and indicated that there will be no further meeting.”
 
 Meanwhile, BMRCL urged the Centre to notify Metro railway services as ‘essential’ under the Centre’s Essential Services Maintenance Act (Esma). However, BMREU insists the management cannot impose   as the issue is still pending before the HC.
 
 BMRCL managing director Mahendra Jain said: “The high court has clearly directed that this ‘so-called union’ should not go on strike without permission and prior intimation ... We have complied with the HC’s directions on every single occasion and will shortly be submitting our report regarding the discussion on non-financial demands to the court,” said Jain.
 
 “We will not hesitate to take stringent action against errant employees if they persist with such threats. We will operate Metro services, with or without them, if ever they decide to go ahead with this self defeating step,” he added.
