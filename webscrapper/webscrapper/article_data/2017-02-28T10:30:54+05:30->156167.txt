HYDERABAD: About 4000 employees of the   reached the office of the principal chief conservator of forests PK Jha to protest against poor salaries and no benefits on Monday.

 The union cried foul over   ( ) and   (ESI) amounts not being deposited in their accounts for the last few years.
 
 The 'scandal' runs to over `50 crore said union members and blamed the government for no salary revision, EPF and ESI amounts, apart from not giving compensation to workers who died in animal attacks over the years. Alwal Shiva Kumar, president   said the forest department employees, including watchers, base camp workers, striking force, animal trackers, animal keepers, gardeners, check post watchers etc have not been listed in the GO 14 released by the Telangana government in January 2016. “Since these categories have not been listed in the GO, workers are being given the excuse when it comes to salary upgrade. They work for `6,0007,000 per month of which `1,000 is deducted as contribution for EPF and ESI.
 
 However not a single paisa has been deposited by the department in the last 15 years. No records have been maintained by authorities.   accounts of workers have not been opened. Then where has all the money gone,“ he said.
 
 The protesters meanwhile insisted on the need for transparency in EPF accounts. “Kindly provide EPF account statements of the amount deducted till date since we joined. Family members of the workers who died on duty should be given compensation,“ reads the representation.
