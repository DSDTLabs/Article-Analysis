KOLHAPUR: More than 12,000 consumers are still awaiting   in the   — comprising Kolhapur and Sangli districts — of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited ( ).

 According to officials, the lack of meter units and most of the demands being from remote areas where network is not enabled to provide services are the main reasons for the delay.
 
 The Kolhapur zone has more than 18 lakh active power consumers across all categories. Since last many years new constructions and housing units have boosted the demand for new connections.
 
 As per the   2014, if a company fails to provide connection to a consumer within one month of their application, it is liable to pay Rs 100 per week till the meter is installed. This provision is applicable where connection is from existing network.
 
 If connection requires extension and augmentation of distributing of main line, then company is liable to pay Rs 100 per week after three months of application. If the application falls in a place where commissioning of new sub-stations forming new part of distribution system is required, compensation is Rs 100 per week after one year of application.
 
 On being asked about the pending connections, acting chief engineer of Kolhapur MSEDCL   told TOI that more than 12 thousand new meter connections are pending with the company.
 
 “We have not received meter units from the headquarters. We will get 5,000 meter units in next 10 days and other 8000 by next month. We have received demands from such areas where the company does not have a network. Therefore, new connections have been delayed. The demand is more from Sangli district. We will install meters as early as possible by next month,” he said.
