Mysuru: Members of the   staged a protest near the Dufferin Clock Tower here on Friday demanding an apology from chief minister   and Karnataka Pradesh   Committee (KPCC) working president   for their remarks on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( ).

 While Siddaramaiah had dubbed RSS a ‘Hindu Extremist’ organisation, Gundu Rao had sought a ban on the BJP and RSS.
 
 Gathering near the clock tower, the protesters alleged that, while Congress was strengthening the Popular Front of India (PFI) and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), it was condemning the RSS and BJP.
 
 “If we are terrorists, why are we allowed to roam freely by the Congress? The government should get us arrested,” the protesters said, raising slogans against the CM and Gundu Rao. “Both of them must tender an apology,” demanded the protesters.
 
 Former minister SA Ramdas said that the CM had dubbed RSS, BJP and Bajrang Dal ‘terrorist’ organisations because the opposition party had sought an explanation on the expenditure of central funds. “The President of India was an RSS swayamsevak. We urge Siddaramaiah to first arrest the President, and then us,” he added.
 
 Accusing Siddaramaiah of dividing people along lines of caste and religion, Ramdas said, “If he is a terrorist, let him not bother with protecting peace and harmony of this country. If he is not a terrorist, he should apologise, and protect the peace of the country.”
 
 Meanwhile, BJP city president BH Manjunath pointed out that RSS had given two Prime Ministers – Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi – to the country. “People not qualified to talk about RSS are making comments about the organisation. If Siddaramaiah was not the CM, we would have ignored these remarks. People of Karnatakawill teach both the Congress and Siddaramaiah a lesson in the 2018 assembly elections,” said Manjunath.
