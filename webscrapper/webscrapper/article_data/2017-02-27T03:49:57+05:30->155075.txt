Vadodara: Chirag Patel, a student living in a hostel on  , was shocked when he saw a tray containing wads of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 currency notes lying unattended at a   (SBI) ATM on Waghodia Road.

 Patel immediately contacted the police control room and informed about the unattended cash. When the police reached there they saw that the cash lying could be around Rs 25 lakh. 
 
 “Prima facie it looked like that someone must have tried to tamper with the ATM to steal cash. We have informed all police stations in the city to check all ATM machines,” said J G Amin, Panigate police inspector . During the search, the police found three similar empty trays at another ATM at Mahavir crossroads near  . “First we suspected that after stealing cash from Mahavir crossroads ATM, the thief must have tried to steal cash from Waghodia Road. 
 
 But, sensing that he might be caught, the thief must have fled from there without taking the cash,” added Amin.
 
 However, upon checking with the bank officials, it was later confirmed that the person who would have come to load the cash must have forgotten to put the cash tray inside the machine. Interestingly, the cash remained there at the ATM since February 23 until Patel saw it late on Saturday night.
 
 Police called SBI officials and the officials of agency responsible for loading cash in the ATM machines to the spot. After checking their records, the bank officials counted the cash which amounted to Rs 24.68 lakh. 
 
 “The bank officials told us that the cash was correct according to their records and not a single penny had been stolen,” Amin said. The police said that they have taken a note that cash amounting to Rs 24.68 lakh that could have been stolen due to irresponsibility of cash loading agency was saved because of Patel’s alertness.
