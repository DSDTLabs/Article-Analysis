MUMBAI: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, jailed NCP leaders   and   were among the 287 of the 288 legislators who exercised their franchise for the   on Monday. 

 Nalasopara MLA Kshitij Thakur, representing Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, was the only MLA who didn’t vote as he was abroad. Pune-based developer and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Kakade exercised his franchise in Mumbai. Congress-led UPA has nominated senior Congress leader Meira Kumar, while BJP-led NDA has nominated Bihar governor Ram Nath Kovind.
 
 There was uncertainty over whether Bhujbal and Kadam would be able to vote since both are in judicial custody. Bhujbal has been lodged in   after he was arrested by the enforcement directorate (ED) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), while Kadam is in the same jail following his alleged involvement in the fraud of a state-run body for the welfare of the downtrodden and weaker section of the society. Both were granted permission to vote by the court. While Bhujbal was brought to   in an ambulance, Kadam came in a police van. In and around Vidhan Bhavan, there was heavy police bandobast to ensure the polling process is peaceful.
 
 BJP had allegedly drafted a plan to engineer a split in Congress and NCP, but NCP leader and former deputy CM Ajit Pawar had ensured that there would be no cross-voting. “All our votes are intact, we do not think that any of our MLA will cross-vote in favour of the NDA nominee,” he said.
