She pleaded with the GRP constable, manning the prepaid counter, to help her with an auto and said she would pay the fare later, but the constable ignored her appeal. Seeing her condition, an auto driver came to her rescue and provided her Rs 100 to book the prepaid auto. But by then it was too late, she said.
 
 Rajashree alleged that when she took her husband to   and Hospital, he was declared brought-dead by doctors. Ojha was a homeopathy doctor.
