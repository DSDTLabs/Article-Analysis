VIJAYWADA: Telegu Desam Party ( ) chief and   Chief Minister N.   on Sunday reiterated the fact that the severing ties with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was down to the 'injustice' dealt to the state by the Centre.
 
 Speaking at the 'Ugadi' (Telegu New Year Day) celebrations here, he said, "I am a senior leader of the country, but I have never shown ego. I am simply asking them to review and provide funds to the state. Injustice is being done by the Centre."
 
 The TDP had earlier ended its partnership with the   (BJP)-led NDA over the failure of the latter to grant a provision of 'Special Category Status' in the Andhra Pradesh.
 
 The demand, for the status, arose when   was scooped out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014 under the Congress-led UPA government, and the latter suffered a considerable reduction in revenue.
 
 The BJP had promised to grant Special Category status to the state, in the 2014 General elections, and later forged an alliance with TDP in the state.
 
 The heightened tensions between the former allies finally concluded with Naidu deciding to pull the party out of the NDA coalition.
