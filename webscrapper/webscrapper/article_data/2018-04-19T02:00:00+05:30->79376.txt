PATNA: The Patna high court on Wednesday ordered the state government to file a counter affidavit within six weeks over underpayment to teaching and non-teaching staff of all the 68 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs) across Bihar.

 While hearing a PIL filed by one Ranjan Kumar, the bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad also ordered the state government’s department of education to file a separate counter affidavit giving details of the staff and funds received from the Centre and expenditures.
 
 Petitioner’s council Pramod Kumar Singh, who was assisted by P P N Shahi, had earlier submitted before the court that teaching and non-teaching staff of KGBVs in Bihar were being paid less than what they are entitled to by the central government.
 
 Singh said the state government is paying less salary to the wardens, teachers, accountants, peons, night guards, cooks and assistant cooks in all the KGBVs opened in and after 2008. “The funds allotted by the central government for payment of salary to the staff are much higher than what they are being paid,” he said, quoting the details procured through RTI.
 
 He said while a warden is eligible for Rs25,000 per month, the state government pays him/her Rs7,700 only. “Similarly, full time and part time teachers are eligible for the salary of Rs20,000 and Rs5,000 per month, but the state government pays Rs6,000 and Rs4,000 respectively to them from the funds allocated by the Centre,” he said, adding the court has been urged to order an inquiry by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India in the matter.
