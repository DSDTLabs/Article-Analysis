MUMBAI: The BEST budget, earmarked for providing power supply to 10.5 lakh consumers in the island city and running 4,200 public transport buses in Mumbai region, was rejected by   for the first time on Tuesday. It was was sent back to the BEST committee for revision in budgetary estimates.

 BEST showed a deficit budget for the first time, with losses of Rs 590 crore for 2017-18, which corporators stated was unacceptable as per rules. Ideally, the budget should be presented to BMC by showing a marginal profit of at least Rs 1lakh in revenue estimates, sources said.
 
 “This was not possible this time,“ BEST general manager Jagdish   told TOI. He said unless there was a special grant from BMC, it was not possible to “adjust“ losses. He explained that BEST could show a marginal profit of Rs 1 lakh through TDLR (transport division loss recovery) surcharge, levied on power consumers; it was to the tune of at least Rs 720 crore annually. But the   had recently directed BEST not to levy the surcharge, and it was withdrawn from bills in 2016.
 
 A few years before that, BEST could adjust profit-loss in balance-sheets by demonetising its assets, which is commercially exploiting its open spaces and depots. A source said BMC too had given loans to the tune of Rs 1,600 crore, which helped BEST project a surplus budget.
 
 “This time, I do not have loans to bank upon, nor do I have the surcharge. Also, we are still demonetising assets,“ Patil said.
