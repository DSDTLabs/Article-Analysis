 JV Rathod, sub-inspector of Changodar police station, said that working on information about a suspicious transaction, a team apprehended Raj Kabra, a resident of Himmatnagar, along with one more person when they were seated in a car near Moraiya Patiya on Saturday.
 
 “Kabra, a native of Rajasthan, owns a bag shop in Himmatnagar. According to his primary statement, his father had sold an ancestral land about one and a half years ago and had received the proceeds. He had however not specified the amount at that time. When he got ill recently, he told the family about the cash he had received and also handed over the notes,” said Rathod.
 
 The investigators said that Kabra had allegedly found an agent who could convert his notes into legitimate currency after getting his cut. “We have got names of the persons and search for them has commenced. We are yet to ascertain how - when even RBI doesn’t accept the notes - the agents could possibly provide them with the new notes,” he said.
