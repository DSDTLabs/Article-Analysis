KOLKATA: Police’s bid to rein in jaywalkers — the boom barriers — saw a mixed reaction on Tuesday as it was made operational at both ends of the the zebra crossing on   at the   crossing. Though the violators outnumbered those who obeyed the new traffic regulations, many felt this initiative would go a long way in reducing accidents.

 “I was a bit curious when I saw this installation and spent a few minutes observing how it functions. It’s a great initiative to discourage jaywalking. In fact, this could be replicated in several busy crossings,” said   of Jadavpur.
 
 Even as the likes of   were patient enough to wait for the barrier to open before crossing the road, there were many who spilled on the road through the gaps of pedestrian dividers. In fact, some even pushed away a make shift barrier placed at the boom barrier’s end to plug in the gap and used this gap to get on the busy crossing.
 
 
  
 A traffic sergeant noticed the loophole and asked a traffic volunteer to close the gap. “Close this gap and ask pedestrians not to cross the barrier from beneath otherwise the purpose of this initiative will be wasted,” the sergeant told the volunteer.
 
 During the evening peak hour, TOI found about two in 10 pedestrians using the boom barrier to cross the road while the rest were found violating it.
 
 Glitches in synchronization, too, was seen when the barrier dropped few times even when the pedestrian signal was green. A few times the zebra crossing, meant for pedestrians, was occupied by traffic when the boom barrier opened. Police expects to mend these errors in due course.
 
 “This initiative will succeed only when all gaps in and around the pedestrian guard rails are plugged in and police start penalising the violators. Otherwise, such indisciplined jaywalkers will continue to play the spoilsport,” said  , a college student.
