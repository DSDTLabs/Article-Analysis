NOIDA: The regional office of the   (UPPCB) has sent a message to   revellers stating the need for conserving water on the day.

 “We would like to reach out to residents of the city and urge that they conserve water on this day. Wastage of water peaks on Holi. Usage of colours should also be limited. While chemical-loaded colours are bad for health, excessive use of water ultimately hits the water table,” B B Awasthi, regional officer of UPPCB, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.
 
 Adding to the caution from the UPPCB, environmental conservator Rakesh Khatri of Ecoroots Foundation, an NGO, said: “Parents should encourage children to play Holi in a healthy manner with natural colours. Everyone should try and prevent harm to roadside animals. Pouring colours on dogs or throwing water balloons at animals should be prohibited.”
 
 According to green activists, each person uses 100 litres of water on Holi on an average. “This year, there has not been enough rain and we need to conserve water. Just like Diwali, there has to be a way to prevent damage to the environment on Holi as well,” Khatri added.
 
 “We have sent our message on the need for conservation through various forms of media. Please keep the larger interest of protecting the environment above the motive of a single day’s festivities,” Awasthi added.
