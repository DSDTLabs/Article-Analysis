GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat, considered to be the   of the BJP, passed a resolution in the assembly on Friday condemning triple talaq and demanding reforms to protect Muslim women against that practice. BJP MLA   presented the resolution, seeking reforms in Muslim personal law and action to ensure the welfare of Muslim women.

 The resolution was supported by the minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja and other ministers and the resolution was passed by the assembly with majority votes in the absence of Congress MLAs who had been suspended earlier. 
 
 “After studying the triple talaq tradition, it has been found that it was started by the   around the 2nd century,” Jadeja said. “However, today, while there are greater rights for Muslim women, it’s necessary to raise a voice against the tradition of triple talaq. There is an urgent need for reforms in Muslim personal law and public opinion must be built for it. So, the house supports the resolution.’’
 
 Jadeja said that even after the Supreme Court had delivered a verdict in the   to protect the rights of Muslim women, the Congress had amended the law for vote-bank politics. “But now the time has come to raise the voice to protect Muslim women and to bring them on a par with women of all communities,” he said. “The Constitution also provides equal rights to all citizens. So, Muslim women cannot be deprived of their rights.”
