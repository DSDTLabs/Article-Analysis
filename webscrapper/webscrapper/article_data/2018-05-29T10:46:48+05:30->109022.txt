CHENNAI: Minutes after issuing a media statement on the ‘permanent closure’ of Sterlite copper smelter unit, chief minister Edappadi K   on Monday told his party legislators that the government had thwarted the plans of the opposition to create ruckus in the assembly when the session began on Tuesday.

 
 During the hour-long meeting of party MLAs ahead of a long assembly session, the chief minister said the opposition’s plans to disrupt the assembly proceedings will not work any more. “When the CM broke the news, the MLAs received it with loud applause,” said a senior leader. Palaniswami said the opposition attempts to topple his government had failed and the state had overcome several challenges in the last 15 months.
 
 Palaniswami said the opposition was envious of the historic achievements of the   government in the Cauvery dispute. With the government managing to get a favourable order from the   to set up mechanisms to resolve the dispute, the opposition is seeking to politicise the Sterlite protests, said an MLA. With deputy chief minister   by his side, the chief minister urged the legislators to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
 
 The MLAs were directed to attend the budget session without fail and participate in the debate for grants for each department, after brushing up on the subjects. The members should confront the opposition with facts, on issues like Cauvery, Sterlite and the DMK’s ‘failures’. The CM reminded them about time running out for the general elections and asked them to prepare for it by increasing cadre strength in the ongoing enrolment drive, sources said.
