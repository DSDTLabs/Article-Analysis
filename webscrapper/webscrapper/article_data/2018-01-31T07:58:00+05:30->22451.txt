GREATER NOIDA: A day after a 25-year-old woman and her two-year-old disabled son were found dead after the WagonR they were travelling in caught fire, police said their postmortem report stated they died of ante-mortem burns. However, the doctor who performed the postmortem has not confirmed this.

 Rabupura SHO   said, “We have got the postmortem report. It says that the deaths happened due to ante-mortem burns.”
 
 However, when contacted, the doctor told TOI on the condition of anonymity that the bodies were “reduced to coal” and identifying whether these were postmortem or anti-mortem burns was not possible with a simple autopsy.
 
 The doctor also refused to confirm whether he had recorded the observation “ante-mortem burns” calling the report “confidential”. The body of Saroj and her son   had been reduced to a pile of burnt bones, he said.
 
 B N  , medico-forensic expert at the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Delhi said only the organs of the body (if they are intact) will help judge whether the burns were ante or post-mortem.
 
 “Even if someone has been killed and burnt later, a pile of bones will not help establish whether the body was burnt before or after the death during a postmortem,” he said, calling the case doubtful.
 
 TOI had reported on Tuesday that the woman and her son died in a suspicious manner after the WagonR they were travelling in caught fire on the Rabupura-Yamuna Expressway link road around 9 pm on Sunday night. Madanpal Singh, the father-in-law of the woman, was behind the wheels and escaped with minor injuries.
 
 While police has questioned the father-in-law of the woman after an FIR was lodged in the case by the Saroj’s father  , no arrests have been made.
