PUNE: A 42-year-old woman has been arrested for allegedly cheating her friends, all members of a women’s club, of Rs 1.25 crore by promising handsome returns on their investments in the share market.

 Senior inspector Rekha Salunkhe of the Alankar police told TOI that Anuja Pande of Himali Society in Erandwane was arrested on Saturday after 10 women registered cheating complaints against her with the police. 
 
 “We expect more women to approach us in the coming days,” she said.
 
 Pande deals in shares and debentures. “All the women, including the victims and the suspect, are members of a women’s club that arranges parties and get-togethers. During one of the meetings, Pande urged all her friends to invest in the stock market, for which she promised 3% per month returns to her friends,” Salunkhe said.
 
 “Trusting her, the women gave her cash and cheques of various amounts, ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 50 lakh per head, to invest in the stock market,” the officer said, adding that all the women also signed memorandums of understanding with Pande.
 
 Initially, Pande paid hefty returns. It was later when the cheques issued by Pande bounced that women decided to lodge complaints against her.
 
 A 47-year-old woman from Kothrud, one of Pande’s friends, was the first one to lodge a complaint against her. In her complaint, she stated that Pande duped her of Rs 30 lakh, for which an FIR was registered on February 27.
 
 Salunkhe said police had initially decided to seal Pande’s properties to recover the money. “However, it was found out later that her properties, including a bungalow in Baner and a flat in Erandwane, besides other valuables were already mortgaged with different banks,” she said.
 
 “We also checked her bank accounts and found that they had a balance of only Rs 4,000,” the officer said, adding that Pande is an LLM degree holder. “Her husband is a prominent city lawyer and her father-in-law is also a well-known lawyer in Aurangabad,” Salunkhe said.
