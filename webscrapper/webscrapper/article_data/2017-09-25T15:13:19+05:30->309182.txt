Actress   has carved a niche for herself in the Malayalam film industry, with just two films such as Jomonte Suviseshangal and Sakhavu. Her performance was so subtle in the films that she has been rated as one of the versatile actresses that we have today. 

 The latest we hear is that she will soon act alongside actor-dancer Prabhudeva, and the film has not been named yet. If reports are to be believed, the film will be a thriller. 
 
 Aishwarya has also bagged Vikram starrer D hruva Natchathiram and Dhanushâ€™s Vada Chennai.
