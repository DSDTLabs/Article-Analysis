CHANDIGARH: Admissions in government and private industrial training institutes in the state are online and none of them should tweak the procedure,   technical education minister   said on Thursday.

 “Only two counselling sessions for admissions in ITIs have taken place and the third session is still going on. No institute can refuse   on available seats as per the reservations policy,” said Channi.
 
 There are 20 days left for admissions. There are 25,837 seats in government institutions and 50,686 seats in private institutions. “Instructions for admissions have already been issued for the year 2017-18 in the government and private industrial training institutes under the reservation polic,” added Channi.
 
 The minister said that, according to the decision taken by the government, fee reimbursement of SC students to the private organisations is to be given equivalent to the fees set by the government organizations.
 
 “As per information received from the welfare department due to dispute in fee structure writ petitions filed in the high court regarding the rate of admission fee in ITIs between government and private institutions, no payment have been made for the ITIs,” he said.
