 More than four months have passed for the election to Zilla Parishad,   Municipal Corporation and the municipal councils, but the district planning committee is yet to be formed.
 
 "Since the much awaited DPC meeting is over, the administration can now go ahead with the election of the DPC, whose members are the elected representatives from the respective local self governing bodies and whose term ceases to exist with the dissolution of that elected body or the disqualification of the member from that elected body," a senior officer from the district collector said.
 
 The district administration has planned to announce the election programme on August 1, to give the committee a month's time to get ready. "The district collector is authorised to call for the election programme with additional collector of Nashik being the returning officer. It is likely that the event will be announced from August 1," the officer said.
 
 Although the district administration is now facing a small hurdle as there is no additional collector who can conduct the election. "Additional collector of Nashik, Kanhuraj Bagate has already been transferred and is in 'waiting'. Additional collector (Malegaon) Dilip Swamy on Wednesday was promoted by the government as deputy commissioner, revenue. As a result, both the posts of additional collectors in the district collectorate are vacant. So, conducting the election programme is being reviewed," the officer said. 
 
 District collector Radhakrishan B will meet revenue commissioner Mahesh Zagade with a request to allow Swamy to conduct  , after which the election programme will be declared. 
 
 The 40 members of DPC, headed by district guardian minister Girish Mahajan consists of 23 members from zilla parishad, 12 from NMC, 3 from municipalities and two from municipal councils. Last time, the DPC elections were held unopposed.
