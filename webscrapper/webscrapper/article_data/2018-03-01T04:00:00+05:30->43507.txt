Surat: City police commissioner Satish Sharma has ordered thorough investigation into suicide of 35-year-old debt-ridden businessman Vijay Vaghasiya, who jumped to death along with his wife Rekha (30) and son Veer (4) on Wednesday. 
 
 Taking a serious note that financial crisis was the reason for Vaghasiaya’s suicide, Sharma instructed city cops to strictly deal with those involved in unauthorised private finance business. Police commissioner also sought help from individuals and asked them to contact Jeevan Astha Helpline or police control room if they are facing financial crisis. 
  
 “Strict action has been taken in number of cases where harassment by private financiers has been proved. We will deal strictly with these type of elements,” Sharma said. 
  
 Though Vaghasiya had mentioned heavy debt as reason in his suicide note, he had not mentioned harassment by private moneylenders. Sharma said that they will check call record data and recent financial transactions to find out if Vaghasiya was being threatened or harassed by any moneylenders. 
  
 “We want people to contact police if they are facing harassment by private financiers. I have instructed all the police stations to immediately take actions in such cases,” Sharma added. The city police had taken up a special drive in past against the private moneylenders and booked those who were doing business without proper license. However, the private financing business was flourishing since it was offering huge amounts to individuals without any collaterals. tnn
