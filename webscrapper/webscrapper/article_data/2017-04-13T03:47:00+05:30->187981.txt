Margao: Quepem police is yet to make a breakthrough in the heist at a cooperative society at Paroda that took place on the intervening night of April 4 and 5. Unidentified intruders had broken into the Paroda V K S S Society Limited and made off with valuables deposited by its customers in the safe deposit lockers. 

 A team of South Goa police that had left for neighbouring states in a bid to trace the accused has returned but failed to obtain any specific leads, sources said. 
 
 “We are attempting to identify culprits who may be part of an inter-state gang,” deputy superintendent of police Sammy Tavares told TOI. 
 
 Sixteen safe deposit lockers had been broken open by the culprits and valuables stolen, police said.
