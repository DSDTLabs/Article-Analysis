  N had paid `40,000 to  , and booked petrol variant of Etios. The delivery of the vehicle was due on November 30, 2014. Sudhakar's banker had remitted the loan of `6,35,000 to the dealer on the day when the car delivery was scheduled. However, to the dismay of Sudhakar, the vehicle was not delivered on one or the other pretext until December 19, 2014.
 
 In the meantime, Sudhakar paid the first installment of the car loan on December 15, even before he took possession of the car. “The dealer time and again made specious excuses for not delivering the car.They said they would deliver the vehicle with a good discount on December 19. When they failed again to keep the promise, they came forward to compensate the delay by offering me Toyota Altis, a more expensive car for the price of Etios. A few days later, they offered me a diesel variant of Etios, but they failed to deliver any vehicle,“ said Sudhakar.
 
 The dealer said that in spite of best efforts, the car could not be deliverd. Therefore, they refunded the loan amount to the bank. “We offered to return the booking amount of `40,000, but Sudhakar refused to take the same,“ said the dealer.
 
 Not convinced with the argument, the forum said that the dealer breached the contract and directed him to pay `1, 03, 500 plus `5000 towards legal costs.
