AMRITSAR: Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh   has written to Prime Minister   to bring back ashes of Maharaja  , the youngest son of the ruler of Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh, from the UK to Amritsar.

 “The government should hold talks with its British counterpart and ensure the body of Duleep Singh is exhumed and his remains are brought back from   to Amritsar,” he has written in the letter to Modi, a copy of which was released to media on Wednesday.
 
 Stating that it was an emotional and sensitive issue for the people of Punjab, Bajwa urged   to personally take the initiative in this matter.
 
 Maharaja Ranjit Singh ruled Punjab from 1799 to 1839. After the annexation of Punjab by the British on March 29, 1849, Duleep Singh was exiled to England at the age of 15, converted to Christianity and was not allowed to meet his mother during the initial few years of exile.
 
 On reuniting with his mother in 1861, he came to know about the rich history of the Sikh empire in India and how the British had annexed their territories.
 
 On October 22, 1893, Duleep died at the age of 55 in Paris. He was cremated according to Christian rites at the Elveden estate in England. His wish for his body to be returned to India was not honoured over fears of unrest, given the symbolic importance, the funeral of the last Maharaja of Punjab would have resulted in growing resentment against the British rule in India.
 
 Bajwa said he had urged Prime Minister to bring back the ashes and cremate Duleep Singh as per Sikh traditions.
