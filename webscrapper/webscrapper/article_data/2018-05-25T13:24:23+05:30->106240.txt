Actress Priya Varrier, who became a national sensation through her classy winks in the song 'Manikyamalaraya poovi' of 'Oru Adaar Love,' has been winning both bouquets and brickbats ever since the song was launched. Most recently, a handful of netizens have found a new reason to bash her yet again. Priya, who arrived in a flowing black dress at a recent award function in Kerala, was helped by a few with her to manage the attire, owing to its length. What irked the social media is the video of the same, and many started commenting on the lines of criticizing her conduct, 'despite being a brand new actress in the industry.' However, many also spoke in favor of Priya, pointing out how the situation is being over-analysed and misinterpreted.  
 Her first film 'Oru Adaar Love' is yet to hit theaters, though the songs and teasers of the movie have already been hits.
