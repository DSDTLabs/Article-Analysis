Vadodara: The rural police arrested a police constable of Halol police station, a state reserve police (SRP) jawan and their ‘informer’ on Monday after the constable and jawan were caught carrying Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) worth Rs 70,000 in a car at Popdipura village.

 Raghu Desai, a constable at Tajpura outpost of Halol police station, Hatesinh Chauhan, SRP jawan, and their informer Bharat Gohil were arrested after the police made sure that they had enough evidences against them.
 
 Desai and Chauhan had told the police that they had raided a farm in Sonavinti village on Gohil’s tip-off and had seized the liquor stock. They said that they were going to Halol police station when a team of local crime branch (LCB) and Waghodia police caught them.
 
 The police had shown Desai and Chauhan as suspects until they were arrested. “It is true that they had raided a farm and had seized the liquor. But they had not informed their senior officials about it and were planning to sell the liquor along with Gohil,” said S D Gamit, circle police inspector, Savli.
 
 On Sunday, cops had tried to get call detail records of the two cops to verify whether they had really received information from Gohil. 
 
 When the version was confirmed, the police contacted their counterparts in Panchmahals, who said that they were not informed by Desai and Chauhan about the raid and seizure.
