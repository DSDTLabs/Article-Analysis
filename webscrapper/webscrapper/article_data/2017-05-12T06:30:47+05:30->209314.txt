AURANGABAD: Police commissioner   organised a demonstration of the chilli powder-laden drones at the police   on the   on Thursday.

 The new   had announced recently that he would acquire drone cameras loaded with chilli and pepper powder to keep a watch on the city and also use them against mobs if the need arises.
 
 The drone demonstration was conducted along with a drill by the police’s quick response team (QRT) to control violent mobs. The QRT also demonstrated how it will deal with suspicious vehicles apart from handling crowds if they go berserk.
 
 Police placed an order for 10 such drone cameras about a few days ago with an aim to ensure quick response by them in case of an untoward incident. 
 
 The drones are expected to reach the spot much before the cops and if required could spray pepper or   to disperse mobs. 
 
 A police official said that the concentrated chilli powder is so hot that even a particle is enough to put a trouble-maker out of actio for several hours. It is, however, not lethal and won’t have long-term effect on the person, he said. 
 
 The official said that a couple of years ago, Yadav had successfully implemented the project while serving as senior superintendent of police, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. 
 
 These drones could be dubbed as best form of surveillance and monitoring, without getting exhausted physically.
