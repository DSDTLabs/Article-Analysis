PANAJI: Differences have arisen between   members and its party president with former Ponda MLA and party general secretary   saying that the BJP-led coalition government has existed in the state on the basis of the ‘fraud’ letter of support submitted by MGP president Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar. 

 The MGP president had submitted the letter of support to governor   and speaker  , in March 2017, to form the BJP-led coalition government. 
 
 “Even MLAs were probably unaware that Dhavalikar gave the letter of support to the BJP government without a MGP central committee resolution,” Mamledar told reporters. 
 
 “We have always followed the procedure of taking a central committee resolution,” Dhavalikar told TOI. 
 
 Mamledar said “there is a huge difference” between the central committee and MGP president over the induction of people in the party. The MGP recently enrolled 200   members. 
 
 “I feel the induction of BJP, RSS and Shiv Sena workers into the party by Dhavalikar is a conspiracy to finish Goa’s oldest regional party,” he said. 
 
 Further alleging that the party president was pushing for merger along with the support of one other party member, Mamledar said the committee has foiled attempts to merge MGP with BJP. 
 
 He also said that besides inducting people into party without consulting the central committee, in the last one year, Dhavalikar has been taking unilateral decisions, which are damaging the party. “Around 36 decisions have been taken by the party president without consulting the central committee,” Mamledar added.
 
 Looking at the decisions taken in the party, it looks like MGP is controlled by a family raj, Mamledar said, adding, “I urge Dhavalikar to take all central committee members along to strengthen the party.” 
 
 Even MLAs were probably unaware that Dhavalikar gave the letter of support to the BJP government without a MGP central committee resolution
