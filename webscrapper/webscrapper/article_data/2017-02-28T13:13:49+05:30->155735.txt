BHOPAL: If a consumer fails to pay power bills for more than 2 months his power connection is snapped, but the office of the ruling   in Mandla district continues to draw power even after not paying its electricity bills for almost a year.

 A power bill of more than Rs 74,000 is due for nearly a year, but neither any payment was made nor any action initiated against the BJP office by the officials of the power distribution company. As per norms followed by the discoms, the connection of a domestic user is terminated once a consumer’s bill crosses Rs 2500 and he has not paid it for more than two months. Junior engineer at the Purv Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company in Mandla, Samresh Kumar, said, “A total of Rs 74,839 is due against the BJP office in Mandla. The last payment was made in August 2016. We had issued notice around a month ago and the old payment is clearly mentioned in each of the monthly bills.” When asked as to why the connection was not disconnected till now, Samresh passed the buck on his senior.
 
 However, his senior assistant engineer, RK Chowrasia, said, “I am new in this place. I don’t know how the bill is so high, but have fixed instalments and an instalment of Rs 40,000 was received in August 2016.” About the norms, he said, “Normally if the payment is not received for two to three months the power supply is disconnected.” However, he could not explain why the connection of the BJP office in Mandla was not terminated despite non-payment of outstanding dues for more than 8 months.
