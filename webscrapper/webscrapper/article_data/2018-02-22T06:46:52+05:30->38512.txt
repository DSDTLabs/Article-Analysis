AHMEDABAD: Just like salmon, the   too is genetically coded to its river. Its depletion is thus nothing less than a tragedy for a species that has been returning to its birthplace to breed over millions of years. 

 This tragedy arose because the Narmada dam, which should be maintaining a minimum “environmental flow” of 2,200 cusecs, but instead reduced this flow to just 600 cusecs since 2005-06, according to senior officials in the Gujarat  . 
 
 The damage was done over a decade as the hilsa would not breed in waters with high salinity values. This is clearly visible in 2000-01 fisheries department data where Hilsa constituted 46% of the total 7,865 metric tonnes inland fish water catch , while six years later, soon after the   was reduced to 600 cusecs, the Hilsa catch plummeted to 21% of the total 21,902 metric tonne catch. “Sadly, it is only now that the Gujarat government has requested the   (NCA) to be allowed to increase its environmental flow to 1,600 cusecs,” added the senior fisheries official.
