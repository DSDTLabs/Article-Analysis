The finance department has introduced the concept of performance budgeting for the first time this year and has presented   (CEMS) of six departments. The evaluation of selected plan schemes of the departments of agriculture, forest and wildlife, water resources, public works, health and higher education were done and presented in the assembly.

 According to finance secretary  , this is a step towards outcome budgeting, which can be expected next year. Outcome budgeting could bring about more transparency and accountability in budget spending.
 
 
 
 
 Finance department officials ascertained pros and cons under various stages of implementation directly from the implementing officers, various stakeholders and beneficiaries of the scheme. Finance team also conducted field visits to evaluate the performance of various schemes and the consolidated report was placed as concurrent evaluation.
 
 For example, in case of PWD, the finance team conducted a field visit to review hill highway projects and visited PWD roads subdivision Kothamangalam on December 12, last year. This was to evaluate work on the stretch from Mamalakandom to Avarukutty. During the visit, it was found that work was stopped by the forest department and two cases were slapped against PWD officials for constructing culverts inside the forest area. The team commented in the report that Mamalakandom Avarukutty road was essential for tribals residing in forest areas.
 
 “If there is any medical emergency in the tribal colony, it is very difficult to reach the nearest hospital through the existing path. This road is also used by the   and   for collecting bamboo.Government should ensure the cooperation of forest department for completing this road,“ it said. Similar studies were conducted for six departments. From next year, all the departments will have to go through such evaluations.
