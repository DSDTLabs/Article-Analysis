   had recently posted a message about her bad experience with   while she was leaving from Mumbai for Poovar, Kerala. When the actress returned to Mumbai, she did a Facebook live while waiting for her cab to arrive.
 
  The video has Payal Rohatgi saying that she didn't get any bus to take her to the aircraft and was refused three times by 2 Muslim officials at the gates.
  
  Payal, who had gone to Kerala with boyfriend Sangram says, "Looking at all the love and hatred that is coming on my timeline on Twitter and the trend that is going on, I have to say that there have been so many times when I have caught flight 20-25 mins prior to coming to the gate and for you record I had reached the airport at 5:20, got my boarding and reached the gate at 6:20, and the flight was at 6:50. I was off loaded saying that there was no extra bus to take me from the gate to the gate because Jet Airways did not have a bus. Whether it was the bus issue or in reality it was a secular issue, I don't know. I just shared my point with you because all three of them at the gates were Muslims. I have nothing against them, in fact I have a neighbour in my Bombay house who is a Muslim. I donâ€™t know if they got up from the wrong side of the bed or was it just us."
  
  
 
  
  "It's not my fault, Sorry! Son next time whenever I am travelling with jet, I am going to make sure that the timings are coordinated and obviously make a video when i reach the gate and probably when I am boarding the flight and after I have boarded the flight. That was the grievance that I shared with you, so don't twist it. It does not make me a non-secular Hindu," she added.
  
  As soon as she posted this video on her Facebook page, fans started sending hate messages to her saying all sort of things.
