 “After meeting Vaniya’s family members, we have decided that the government must announce speedy trials in Vaniya’s case and the Una flogging case within four days. If not, then Vaniya’s family members will return the compensation cheque of Rs 4 lakh given to them by the government,” said Mevani, adding that this was a collective decision supported by other members of the community.
 
 Mevani added, “The chargesheet in the Shapar case should be filed within three months and both the Shapar and Una flogging cases should be concluded within four months.”
 
 “As far as the financial aid is concerned, we will collect and donate Rs 8 lakh to the family for which I will start a crowd-funding drive,” said Mevani.
 
 The state government had announced Rs 8.25 lakh as compensation to Vaniya’s family and half of the amount has been handed over to them, whereas the rest will be given after chargesheet is filed.
