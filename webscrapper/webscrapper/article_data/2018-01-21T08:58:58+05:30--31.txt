PATNA: Chief minister   is the only VIP from   to have got Z-plus security, as of today.

 The Union ministry of home affairs issued a notification in this regard on January 15. Nitish will get the security cover wherever he goes in the country.
 
 According to sources, the CM’s Z-category security hitherto involved the Special Security Group commandos of the state government. His Z-plus security cover, however, will involve the   (CRPF) commandos, who have been specially trained in VIP security and are armed with modern weapons.
 
 The sources said though the Centre okayed the Z-plus security to Nitish on the basis of the state government’s letter to it on August 1 last year, the immediate trigger was the attack on his convoy at Nandan village in Buxar district on January 12 this year.
 
 The state has 16 other VIPs who are protected by central government’s security personnel under different categories ranging from ‘Y’ to ‘Z’. On December 25 last year, RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s security cover was downgraded from Z-plus to Z. Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Z-plus security cover was completely withdrawn.
 
 “BJP’s former MP Shahnawaz Hussain, Saran MP Rajeev Pratap Rudy, Union minster and LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan and Union minister Radha Mohan Singh have also got the central government’s Z category security cover,” said an official.
 
 The Z-plus security cover consists of 46 to 108 CRPF commandos for overall protection and six National   commandos, especially for escort duty during the VIP’s movement. Z category consists of 26 CRPF commandos, Y-plus of 11 commandos and Y category consists of 11 commandos. X category security cover involves only two commandos.
