Bathinda: The Mansa police on Thursday registered a case against a villager on accusations of spreading rumours about Measles Rubella (MR) vaccination, asking people not to go for it. The complaint has been made by a Mansa civil surgeon against Najam Singh of Nangal Kalan village in Mansa for circulating a video clip in Whatsapp groups, telling people that the MR vaccination had passed its expiry date and could cause problems to kids. The MR vaccination was started by the Punjab government on May 1 under the national programme on children from 9 months to 15 years, and the expiry year is 2020.

 Five students of Class X of the Senior Secondary School, Nangal Kalan, had suffered some problems after the vaccination on Tuesday, and they were taken to hospital. They were, however, let off after some time. Mansa civil surgeon Dr Anup Kumar said the vaccination was fully safe with no issue of any kind, including the expiry date. He said: “The video clip was false, and meant to scare students and their parents. The clip also tarnished the image of the state health department without any reason. I have made the complaint to the police to register a case against Najam Singh for spreading false rumours, and trying to fail a national programme.”
 
 Mansa DSP Karanveer Singh said upon investigating the matter under charges of the Information Technology Act and under Section 505 (whoever makes, circulates or publishes rumour or report with intent to cause disregard) has been registered at Mansa Sadar police station against Najam Singh.
