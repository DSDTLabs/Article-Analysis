Deputy commissioner of police MN Anucheth said that the postmortem would help the cops ascertain the cause of death. "While Rohini claims that it was her kick that led to Arun's death, investigators have found an injury on his head. At the moment, we cannot conclusively say which injury led to his death, or if his medical condition played a role. We have to wait for the postmortem report," he said. 
 
 When asked if the husband's attempt to force himself on Rohini amounted to rape, Anucheth said that would be decided by the court. "As of now, we have booked a case of murder," he added.
