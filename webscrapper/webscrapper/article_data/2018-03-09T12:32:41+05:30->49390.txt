NAGPUR: Both factions of city Congress returned empty-handed from New Delhi without getting a chance to meet party President  . The leader left for Singapore to attend a meet of non-resident Indians (NRIs) on Wednesday night. Both factions had camped in the national capital for three days. 

 The 36-member Vilas Muttemwar group had gone to meet Gandhi to seek action against members of   group. Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) had expelled Chaturvedi from the party last month for anti-party activities. In spite of this, several Congress leaders from the city like former minister Nitin Raut and leader of opposition in   (NMC) Tanaji Wanve have rallied around him.
 
 The Muttemwar faction had left for Delhi first. As soon as Chaturvedi faction learnt about this, about 60 members rushed to the capital. They met several senior Congress leaders and demanded that elections of city Congress committee should be held immediately. They claimed that the current President  , who belongs to Muttemwar camp, had lost the confidence of most Congress workers of Nagpur.
 
 Both factions told senior Congress leaders that unless the rift is healed, it would be difficult for the party to give a fight to BJPâ€™s sitting MP Nitin Gadkari, who is a Union minister, in   elections of 2019.
