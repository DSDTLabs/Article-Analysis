, who became a proud father to twins   and   via surrogacy last month, finally took home his newborns on Wednesday. Naturally, the newly-turned father has exciting plans on how he will raise his twins and revealed all about it at a recent event. 
 
 For starters, Karan wants his kids to share his passion for music. The filmmaker revealed that when he made the nursery for his kids, he made sure that there’s music played in the room at all times, so that they grow up to love music. However, the ‘Ae Dil Hai mushkil’ director was quick to add that he doesn’t want his kids to listen to Coldplay’s version of nursery rhymes. 
  
 “Some people told me that there were   versions of nursery rhymes, but I definitely didn’t want that for them. I want them to learn and grow to the music that I grew up with because they are my children, and they have to love the music I love because they have to love me,” he said. Karan added that his love for music is inspired by his mom, who would listen to ghazals and songs sung by  , Lata Mangeshkar and Kishore Kumar.
