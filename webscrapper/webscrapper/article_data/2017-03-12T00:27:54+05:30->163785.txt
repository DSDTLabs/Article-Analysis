A tough week awaits banks as the ceiling on withdrawal of cash through ATMs and savings bank accounts is set to be removed on Monday. Banks are short on currency and are worried about meeting the demand. “The cap on current accounts was lifted earlier, but it continued unofficially as we are not in a position to pay cash. Now that the cap on savings accounts will also be lifted on Monday, the problem will be compounded,” said a banker. “My branch refused to pay Rs 2 lakh from my current account,” said V Chandra Sekhar, a customer of a private bank in Sitaphalmandi. According to bankers, the situation will improve only after 10 days. “We are receiving only half the amount we need from RBI,” an official said. Banks have also been told to pump in money in rural areas for pensions. tnn
