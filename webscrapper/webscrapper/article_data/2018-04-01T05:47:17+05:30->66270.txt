KOLKATA : The West Bengal Medical Council’s decision last Thursday to cancel the practising licences of two Apollo Gleneagles doctors — surgeon   and radiologist   — for six months to a year might have brought some relief to victim Sanjay Roy’s family, but the original police probe launched last February is far from being over.

 The officer probing the case said that two key documents — the health department report and an advanced forensic examination report — were pending. Sources claimed though they have “leads on certain lapses”, they would need confirmation from professionals before those leads can be treated as case evidence.
 
 
 “One must understand that the WBMC’s decision will not affect our probe. We will need the health departmentappointed mandatory committee’s report to proceed,” said DC (ESD) Debasmita Das. The FIR is pending with the Phoolbagan police.
 
 The delay, claimed sources, was all the more baffling given that probe into Roy’s death, along with investigation into the death of   at  , were among a handful of cases where the health department appointed a mandatory committee.
 
 There are 21 such medical cases in the city now and the probe into most of them has been limited to cops collecting documents from officials concerned.
 
 “Officers probing the medical negligence cases are in a
 
 fix. Each week sees new complaints, but we lack the necessary expertise. The law states that we have to seek opinion from a medical board. What can we do if we this board is not formed,” wondered an IPS officer.
 
 The health department, on the other hand, claimed that most times, the police work was sloppy. “Tell me one important case where there has been a delay on our part. The cops cannot drag their feet in such cases,” said an official.
