NEW DELHI: In a bid to improve the conditions of   in and around   in the capital, the Delhi division of   has invited tenders for around  , which fall under their jurisdiction, where high quality toilets are to be built by the end of the year.

 
 An integral part of the Swachh Bharat Mission as well, railway officials said general cleanliness and maintenance of toilets had been a problem in the past and focus has been shifted to improving toilet facilities at all A1, A and B category stations which fall under them.
 
 A senior railway official told TOI that bids are already being invited with the successful bidders responsible for building high quality standard “pay and use” toilet complexes on railway land. While using urinals will be free, a nominal fee will be charged for those who use the toilets.
 
 Under the first phase, stations covered will include major ones like New Delhi, Old Delhi, Nizamuddin, Sarai Rohilla, Delhi Cantt and smaller ones like Okhla, Adarsh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Nangloi, Delhi Shahdara, Ballabhgarh, Sahibabad and Faridabad, among others.
 
 “Most of the toilets are expected to be commissioned by November or December 2018 and this will bring about a marked improvement in the standard of cleanliness at these stations. These hygienic toilets will deter open defecation and help keep the station premises clean while operators can generate revenue through advertisement,” said RN Singh, divisional railway manager, Delhi division.
 
 The division said they have also taken into consideration the revamping of existing toilet complexes, identifying those which are in a poor condition and planning their remodelling through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. “We are planning to float tenders for this very soon and six toilets will be renovated at New Delhi and Old Delhi, while two units will be renovated at Anand Vihar very soon,” said a senior official.
