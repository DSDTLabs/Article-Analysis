HYDERABAD: In a chilling incident, three persons, posing as passengers, killed an Ola cab driver and stole his sedan recently. Details of the gruesome murder came to light on Wednesday after the trio was arrested by the   police. 

 Police arrested Sk Hafeez, 20, a car driver,  , 20, a fabrication worker, and  , 21, an auto driver from Jeedimetla. The deceased was identified as Md Jahangir, 20, from Chintalmet in Rajendranagar. 
 
 On April 20, the trio decided to kill a cab driver and steal the car to make quick money by selling its parts. As part of the plan, they booked a cab from   to Miyapur at 3 pm. However, they could not execute it during the journey as the route witnessed heavy traffic.
 
 At Miyapur, they booked a cab again, this time to go to Patancheru. The victim, an Ola cab driver, came to pick them up in his Hyundai Xcent (TS08 UD 6320). They even offered to pay 750 advance to convince the victim to take them to their destination. "After reaching Patancheru, they convinced the cab driver to take them to Zaheerabad. Their intention was to find an isolated spot to kill the cab driver," Rajendranagar ACP P Ashok said 
 
 En route, the trio purchased whiskey and continued the journey consuming liquor. As they were nearing Zaheerabad, Hafeez slammed the empty liquor bottle on the driver's head. 
 
 "They pulled aside the driver from the seat and parked the car at an isolated place. They dragged him into bushes and killed him by throwing boulders on the head," the ACP said.
