Chandrapur: District president of women’s wing of Congress was caught red-handed by police for extorting money from a couple in matrimonial dispute. 

 The couple had approached the Women’s Complaint Redressal Cell of the police department over the issue. Congress leader Ashwini Khobragade got in touch with the woman who had some dispute with her husband and assured her to build a case in her favour. For this, she demanded a sum of Rs12,000 on the pretext that the money was meant for cops at the redressal cell. 
 
 According to sub-divisional police officer Sushilkumar Naik, the aggrieved woman paid Khobragade Rs5,000 as initial payment. Later, the Congress leader sought Rs7,000 to settle the matter. Suspecting her motive, the woman contacted cops working in the redressal cell and was shocked to learn that she was cheated. 
 
 After hearing her complaint, the city police laid a trap and sent the complainant woman to Khobragade with money. As soon as she took money, the cops caught her.
 
 An offence has been registered under section 384 of IPC against Khobragade, but no arrest was made as yet.
