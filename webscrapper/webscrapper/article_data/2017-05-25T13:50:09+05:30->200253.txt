It happens to the best of us. We diligently follow our diets when we are home but let ourselves loose while  .

 While food is part of any vacation experience, it’s a bad idea to just eat your way through a holiday. Here are a few health tips to keep in mind while travelling.
 
 
 
 
 The journey to weight loss often starts with the way you think about it. Something as simple as making a decision not to gain weight could help you see your vacation   in a whole new way. You could practise visualisation techniques. For example, you could start by picturing yourself arriving at your destination, focusing on the place, the people, the monuments, taking boat rides and getting spa treatments. The more non-food elements you ‘see’, the less chance there is for you to binge.
 
 
 
 
 Buck the weight gain tendency by increasing the frequency of exercise, or eat light for a week or so before you leave. With access to so much information online, you could also plan what you eat by studying the local cuisine and picking healthy options for a few meals.
 
 
 Why not have fresh fruit or a handful of nuts packed in a zip-lock bag when you are visiting a monument? Light snacking helps curb hunger pangs, which otherwise leads to bingeing.
 
 
 
 You don’t have to feel deprived by not indulging in local delicacies. Choose one meal a day where you can eat whatever you want. Make sure your other two meals are light.
 
 
 The above, of course, would need to be backed up by exercise. Always remember that a new place is best discovered on foot. Walk as much as possible.
 
 
 
 Adequate hydration is crucial to boost your vacation experience. Carry a bottle of water wherever you go and see for yourself how you return home without excess baggage.
