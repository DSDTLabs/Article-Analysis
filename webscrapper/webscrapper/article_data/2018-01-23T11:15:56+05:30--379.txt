PATNA: Congress   on Monday not only justified his participation in the state government-sponsored human chain on January 21 despite his party’s decision to boycott the event, but also questioned the   leadership’s decision to side with   chief Lalu Prasad, who was recently convicted in a fodder scam case and sent to Birsa Munda central jail in Ranchi.

 “Is it a crime to support a person who has been fighting against social evils like dowry and child marriage?”   asked. Talking to TOI over phone, he also admitted that he had joined the human chain near the residence of JD (U) national general secretary and   member R C P Singh along with some JD (U) functionaries. “I joined the human chain because it was not organised on party lines. The campaign was against social evils,” he said.
 
  president (incharge) Kaukab   said the party has taken a serious note of Bharti’s participation in the human chain. “I discussed the matter with senior leaders, including the   leader  . I personally talked to Bharti and issued him a sort of warning for violating the party’s decision of boycotting the human chain,” Quadri said, adding if Bharti repeats any such act, the party will take action against him.
 
 Earlier on Sunday, a high voltage controversy erupted in the state Congress after the party received information that Bharti, one of its six members in the legislative council, joined the human chain in violation of the party’s decision. 
 
 The human chain was formed by the state government to create public awareness against dowry and child marriage. Though CM   had appealed to all political parties to join it, Lalu Prasad’s RJD and the Congress had boycotted the event.
