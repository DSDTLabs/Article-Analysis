GURUGRAM: Around 100 employees of   ( ) — mostly   — held a protest rally at the discom’s Sector 14 office on Friday, alleging they were being harassed by the department, which often fails to provide necessary materials and resources to set up power infrastructure.

 The employees also alleged that the department recovered money for losses or repairs from their salaries without informing them.   employees said they were being forced to wait for as long as six months even after raising a request for transformers for their respective areas.
 
  “The lack of resources has been affecting the power supply in residential areas, and has been raising public ire,” a protester said. The protest was organised under the banner of Haryana State Electricity Board Diploma Engineers Association, Gurugram.
 
 “Junior engineers work round-the-clock. Sometimes, it takes up to six months to replace a transformer, and we are forced to spend from our pocket,” said Kapoor Singh, a member of Haryana State Electricity Board Diploma Engineers Association, Gurugram.
 
 The association submitted a memorandum to the DHBVN’s managing director and director through local officials. 
 
 Discom officials, when approached for a comment, said as per the rules of the department, the junior engineers were supposed to take care of maintenance of the transformers, and hence money would be deducted from their salaries for losses and repairs. “We have received a memorandum from the protesters and sent it to senior officials in Chandigarh,” said Naveen Verma , superintending engineer, DHBVN.
