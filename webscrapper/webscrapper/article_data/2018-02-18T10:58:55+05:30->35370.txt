CALANGUTE: Members of the North Goa Tourist   Owners Associatio (NGTTOA) met deputy speaker and   Michael Lobo, on Saturday, and urged him to act on the written assurance he had given striking taxi owners at   last month.

 The strike had been called off following an assurance by Lobo that he would take up their demands with the state government.
 
 During the meeting, Lobo said he would arrange interactions with the chief secretary, director of transport, tourism director and other senior officers, allowing taxi owners to discuss their pending demands and find solutions. “After the meetings the officials will give a report to the chief minister for implementation,” Lobo said.
 
 Among the taxi owners’ main demands is the filing of an intervention petition in the   to stop the installation of speed governors by March 25.
 
 “We will first take legal advice whether to approach the Supreme Court,” Lobo told taxi owners.
