CHENNAI: The state government on Thursday mounted pressure on governor C   to clear appointments of vice-chancellors for four universities by deputing chief secretary Girija Vaidyanathan and higher education secretary Sunil Paliwal to call on him at  .

 Immediately after the cabinet meeting at the secretariat, Vaidyanathan and Paliwal rushed to Raj Bhavan and they were closeted with Rao for about 20 minutes. The officials conveyed to the governor issues like delay in holding convocation, caused primarily by non-appointment of VCs to several universities.
 
 Rao had apparently gone slow on appointing VCs as many such appointments made in the past were mired in controversies. There were also large-scale allegations in the past that VC posts were on sale in the state for amounts ranging from Rs 3 crore to Rs 35 crore depending on the scope of earning in such posts.
 
 As on date, posts of vice-chancellors are vacant in four state universities -   Dr Ambedkar Law University, Chennai, Madras University, Madurai Kamaraj University and Anna University. The vice-chancellor search committees for all these universities are in place. The posts have been vacant for more than a year in Madras University, Madurai Kamaraj University and Anna University. 
 
 One of the search committee members of the   had opposed the selection of a candidate and had resigned from the search committee itself.
