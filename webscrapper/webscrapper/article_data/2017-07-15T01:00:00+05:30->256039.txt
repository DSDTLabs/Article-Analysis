 The film, which marks Dhanush’s return to Bollywood after two years, is a Hindi version of the Tamil film, 'VIP 2'. While the soundtrack of most dubbed movies sound quite unstimulating, with makers not paying much attention to the lyrics or sound quality, this album stands out. The songs and lyrics ( ) seem tailor-made for B-Town. Interestingly, every song is titled and brings out the essence of the number. 
 Heavy electric guitar and acoustic beats open 'Life Of Raghuvaran -Chal Re Raja', which introduces us to the lead character. Sung by Rahul Nambiar and rapped by Yogi B, this high-on-energy number also features the traditional thavil instrument predominantly (composer Sean Roldan is the son of a renowned mridangam artiste and started his career by working on Carnatic songs). 
 Next in line is 'Angel Of Raghuvaran - Tu Mili Hai', probably the only hummable number from the album. Abhay Jodhpurkar and MM Manasi do a good job in keeping the melody intact and the use of flute intermittently adds to the charm. 
 'Torture Of Raghuvaran - Main Ga Raha', in the voice of KG Ranjith, joins the list of those songs that tell you why you shouldn’t fall in love or get married. A fun, tapori-style number, it’s high on wind instruments like the nadaswaram and trumpet and bass. 
  plays an antagonist of sorts in the film, and 'Raghuvaran Vs  ' reflects the way her character locks horn with Dhanush’s in the film. Shakthisree Gopalan and Benny Dayal render it in a stylish, Westernised way, and the electrifying string section lifts the song. 
 The instrumental 'Vasundhara - The Empress Arrives' sounds fleetingly similar to the previous song, but the energetic trumpet-string arrangements make it worth a listen. While the album on the whole is interesting, all the songs might not have recall value.
