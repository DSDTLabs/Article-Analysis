HYDERABAD: Use of mobile phones while riding/driving is one of the biggest road safety concerns, say experts, adding that cellphone-driving is in fact far more dangerous than drink-driving in terms of the driver being distracted or his focus being impaired.

 Also a matter of concern is the rising number of road users who are indulging in this habit, say road safety experts, while pointing to statistics available with the traffic police. More than 49,385 cases of illegal use of mobile devices by drivers, to talk or text while behind the wheel, have been booked in Hyderabad alone in 2017. A shocking 1,26,555 such cases were booked by traffic cops in 2015, while 52,535 drivers were booked for the same offence in 2016. In the last three years, 2,28,495 cases have been booked.
