RIO DE JANEIRO: You may be the leader of a country and have the best possible security, but that might not guarantee your safety from paranormal apparitions. 

 Or so it seems to be the case for Brazillian president  , who decamped from his official residence at the   in   after he and his family felt "bad vibes" emanating from the luxurious building. 
 
 "I felt something strange there. I wasn't able to sleep right from the first night. The energy wasn't good... We even started to wonder: could there be ghosts?" Temer was quoted as saying by Veja News.
 
 The modernist Alvorada Palace is a sumptuous residence at the heart of  's capital city, and is equipped with a huge pool, football field, chapel, medical center and vast lawn. 
 
 According to a report in Globo newspaper, Temer's wife Marcela brought in a priest to attempt to drive out any evil spirits, but to no avail.
 
 In the end, Temer and his family moved to the smaller, but still luxurious, vice presidential residence of Jaburu Palace.
 
 Temer knows it well. This was his residence when he served as vice president until last year when then president   was impeached for breaking budget accounting laws.
 
 That automatically put Temer in the top job and in the Alvorada. However, since no one filled his vacant vice presidential post, he can now take his pick of palaces.
 
 The house moving comes in the middle of a severe political crisis for Brazil, with many of Temer's allies facing potential corruption probes.
