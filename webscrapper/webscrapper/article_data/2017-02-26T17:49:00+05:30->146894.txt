 The filmmaker says that the movie has a village setting and Askar plays a rustic youth in it. 'The film will focus more on romance than the humour track.

 As for Askar, he is quite excited to have bagged a romcom at a time when he is just completing his first film. 'I will have to work hard to get into the skin of the character in Chembarathipoovu, in terms of both looks and characterisation. And I'm quite excited to try out the role,' he says. Poomaram fame Santhosh is the cinematographer for the movie, which has newbie A R Rakesh as the music composer.
