PANAJI: The farmers in the state have reported a favourable pepper production this harvest season.

 If taken up commercially, Goa has a lot of potential for pepper production. The state department of agriculture informed that 600-800 tonnes of pepper were produced in Goa in the financial year 2015-16 alone. “There is a lucrative market for pepper in Goa,” said agriculture director,  .
 
 In a matter of one decade, pepper production has gone from 1500kg a year to a lower level and from there it rose to 1000kg this year for some farmers. The ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute, Goa, attributed the reason of the fluctuation to climate change and plant diseases.
 
 “The crop production reduced by 50% in the past eight years due to foot rot disease and improper weather parameters,” said one such pepper farmer, Chinmay Tanshikar.
 
 Principal scientist (horticulture) at ICAR-CCRI, Dr   said, “A sharp decline in yield of pepper is seen in Goa due to aberrant weather conditions leading to deficit of water, incidence of disease and escalating production costs.”
 
 Farmers have said that excess rain also leads to a fungal growth called Phytophera which rapidly spreads from one plant to another. In order to tackle this and foot rot disease, farmers source biological control agents like Tricoderma and Pseudomonus from   and  .
 
 “We are hopeful that the yield potential can be achieved at 1500kg per year with the use of good quality biological agents. These help in repelling plant diseases,” said Tanshikar.
 
 The ICAR-CCRI is also making attempts to improve the pepper production scenario in the state. They are currently researching on pepper as a component crop in coconut and areca nut-based cropping systems.
