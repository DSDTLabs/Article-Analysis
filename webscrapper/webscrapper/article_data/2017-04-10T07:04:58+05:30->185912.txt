HYDERABAD: The Hussainialam police is all set to take alleged fake lawyer   to Meerut, Uttar Pradesh in connection with the probe into his forged law degree. 

 Last January, cops registered a cheating and forgery case against Shareef, the prime accused in the murder of a printing press owner. Police said the accused, who is currently in judicial custody, is likely to be taken into police custody on a prisoner transit warrant. 
 
 Sources said that Shareef had furnished his educational certificates to the Bar Council of AP. He produced an LLB certificate, which he said was issued by Ch Charan Singh University, Meerut, with the enrolment number M 9156892 from 1994 to 1996. He also submitted copies of B.Com degree and claimed to have graduated as a private candidate at the same varsity from 1991 to 1993. Based on this, the Bar Council of AP enrolled him as an advocate on September 23, 1999.
 
 Inquiries with the   and Charan Singh University revealed that the degrees were not on record. “We are taking the   into police custody. He will be taken to the university to corroborate evidence,” Charminar ACP K   said.
