MYSURU: Close on the heels of the tourism department’s 3-D projection mapping initiative on a building in   during Dasara celebrations and recently in Bengaluru, the Mysuru district administration wants to make it a permanent feature here to attract tourists. 

 It plans to select a few heritage buildings, including Mysuru Palace and Rangacharlu Memorial Town Hall. As the mapping received a good response in Mysuru and Bengaluru, the authorities want to cash in on it. Projection mapping, also known as video mapping, uses buildings into display surfaces or canvases for video displays.
 
 This technology was tried during the Dasara celebrations for three days. It was done on the Town Hall. During a ten-minute programme, the grand history of Mysuru and Karnataka was showcased through audio and video projection. It was a treat for visitors who were mesmerized by the display.
 
 The projection brings alive a structure through video display just like the sound and light programme at Mysuru Palace. Recently, the tourism department organized a similar show on Utility Building in Bengaluru as part of the 9th edition of the Bengaluru International Film Festival.
 
 Deputy commissioner D Randeep said projection mapping will surely draw people to Mysuru. “We have identified three monument -- Mysuru Palace, Jagan Mohan Palace and Town Hall. Mysuru Palace will be our first choice as we have a sound and light show already in place. Tourism minister Priyank M Kharge responded positively to the idea. We’re open to firms working with us on this and they could approach the district administration.”
 
 Mysuru Travel Agents’ Association president C A Jayakumar appreciated the district administration’s initiative.
