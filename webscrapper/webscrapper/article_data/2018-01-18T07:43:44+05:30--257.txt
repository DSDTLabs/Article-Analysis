MEERUT
 Kasif Ali, a TV actor from Meerut, currently based in Mumbai, has narrated the ordeal of his family (wife, three children, father and an ailing mother) in a video post on  , after a team of Meerut police raided their house on the intervening night of January 15-16. The cops were looking for a “suspect”.
 
  The actor has claimed that the police team from   station destroyed CCTV cameras installed at the entrance of the house and that there is footage to confirm that. “More than a dozen cops barged into our house without any search warrant. They broke the lock at the main gate and vandalized CCTV cameras. They kept on asking about a suspect to my family members, including my ailing mother who is a heart patient. Everyone knows the kind of message that is sent out after such an action. Even families of terrorists are not treated like this,” the actor told TOI over the phone from Mumbai, where he is shooting for an ongoing TV serial titled ‘Kundali Bhagya’.
  
  A visibly enraged Ali took to social media to vent out his anger on the alleged breach of privacy. In the video, he used some objectionable words against the police department for “terrorising his family”. Later, however, he deleted the video and uploaded a fresh clipping narrating his family’s ordeal. In the second video, he also apologized for using objectionable language.
  
  “It was an outburst and I could not control my anger. But I want to ask the authorities how can police behave like a bunch of hoodlums who vandalize property and terrorize innocent people. If their intention was to trace a suspect, why would they destroy CCTV cameras,” Ali said.
