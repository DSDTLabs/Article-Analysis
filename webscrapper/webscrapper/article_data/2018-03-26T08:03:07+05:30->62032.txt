HYDERABAD: The TRS government has removed over 4 lakh ration cards in   limits.

 Some of these card holders were earning over Rs 30,000 per month and a few others were landlords owning up to 30 acres of land. There were “double card holders” too, having one each in village and in Hyderabad.
 
 The state government might soon do away with the rule of holding a ration card being mandatory to avail schemes such as Arogya Sri, Kalyan Lakshmi and free treatment in corporate hospitals. The cards would be reduced to just “food security cards” for   families to avail rice on subsidy.
 
 Finance and civil supplies minister Eatala   stated that ration cards of only the rich were cancelled and that TRS government was in no mood to allow “above BPL category families” to avail ration card facility.
 
 Responding to issues raised by MLAs from various parties that the previous governments had extended sugar, edible oil, wheat and other commodities on subsidy   through fair price shops to the poor, Rajender read out conditions of the Central Food Security Act which stated that ration cards had to be confined only to food security.
 
 He told the   that state government was giving subsidy rice through public distribution system to 36 lakh additional families apart from the 50.13 lakh families identified by the Central government in the state.
 
 “Nearly 36 lakh more families comprising 83 lakh people are being given PDS rice by the state government. The KCR-government is spending from its pocket to do this,” Rajender said, adding that TRS government also lifted the cap of 20-kg rice per family and was providing 6-kg rice to every member of family.
