LUCKNOW: A 45-year-old man who worked in a   died after suddenly being hit by an object on Sunday. 

 The police have not been able to find so far whether the man was shot dead or he fell victim to accidental firing.
 
 The victim, Rajesh Soni, was cooking in the dhaba located near   railway station where he had been working for several years. 
 
 Around 2.30pm, when he was preparing chapatis, he suddenly slumped while crying in pain. Fellow workers found blood oozing out from his chest. They rushed him to Lohia hospital, where he was declared brought dead. 
 
 Doctors said Soni had injuries 2cm below his heart and a bullet-like object was lodged in his ribs. A postmortem examination would clear what it was, they added.
 
 Circle officer (Gomtinagar) Deepak Kumar said that locals had told them about some people firing in the air to shoo away monkeys in the area. 
 
 "Prima facie it seems that a stray bullet or pellet accidentally hit the victim and he died of the injuries," Kumar said.
 
 Police are yet to ascertain if a bullet or pellets from an air gun killed Soni. 
 
 "We have detained some people and they are being interrogated," he said.
