Today’s big screen release, ‘Rendu Rellu Aaru’, had piqued the curiosity of cinephiles with its intriguing trailer. And as far as the first half of this Nandu-directed film is concerned, the makers seem to have ticked all the right boxes. Here’s what you can expect until interval:

 Raju (Naresh Sr) and Rao (Ravi Kale), who happen to be neighbours, exchange their children — a boy and a girl — at birth for reasons best known to them.
 
 Now grown up, Maddy (Anil) and Maggie (Mahima) fall in love, much to the chagrin of their parents, who make great efforts to tear them apart. Will love conquer hatred?
 
 As the plot builds up, the exceptional background score (by Vijay Bulganin), feel-good moments and situational comedy make it a wholesome entertainer.
