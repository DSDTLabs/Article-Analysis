SURAT: A team of experts visited   (NCH) campus here on Monday to prepare a blueprint for the development of a stem cell hospital on its campus. There were experts from different parts of the country. Another team of officials from Delhi is expected to visit   on Tuesday to assess the development of the super speciality hospital which is coming up in the city.

 These projects have been delayed for several months now. However, they have got off to a good start thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the city next week. Modi is scheduled to inaugurate Samasta   Arogya Trust’s Kiran Multi Super Specialty Hospital and Research Centre, which has been built with contribution from members of Patidar community.
 
 The team that visited NCH included J P Gupta, health commissioner, and five experts who belonged to different states of the country. They held a meeting with NCH officials and   (GMC) authorities to prepare a blueprint for the stem cell hospital on NCH campus.
 
 “The development plan of the hospital was discussed at the meeting. The hospital will have facility for treatment and research on blood-related diseases,” said Jayesh Brahmbhatt, dean, GMC.
