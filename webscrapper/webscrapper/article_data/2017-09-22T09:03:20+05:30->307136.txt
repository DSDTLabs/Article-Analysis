JAIPUR: The   may have banned  , politicians and bureaucrats from May 1 in an attempt to end privileges often seen as  . But ground realities, at least in Rajasthan, tell a different story. There are three policemen deployed in the state to protect each VIP as compared to just one for 821 citizens.

 The data from the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D), in possession of TOI, shows that the disparity exists even when the number of policemen in the state was increased to 89,500 on January 1, 2017, from 70,000 a year earlier.
 
 The data reveals that in Rajasthan, a policeman oversees an area of 3.28 sqkm — the highest area covered by any policeman in the country.
 
 However, the data also shows that in 2016, the number of ‘VIPs’ increased to 471 from 458 in 2015, whereas the number of policemen deployed for their security in 2016 went down to 1,541 from 1,778 in 2015. Earlier, cop-VIP ratio was around 4:1.
 
 In 2013, the Supreme Court had directed the state governments to furnish details of number of police personnel deployed for protection of politicians and VIPs amid a national debate on why VIPs enjoy lavish security while a common man’s grievances are hardly addressed.
 
 The apex court, in its order, had said, “Why security is given to those who are not in power and against whom cases are pending?”
 
 The BPR&D data shows a huge shortage of policemen for ordinary citizens while three cops are guarding each VIP.
 
 Even in the country, out of a total 19.26 lakh police officers, 56,944 are deployed just for the safety of 20,828 VIPs across 29 states and six Union territories.
 
 In Rajasthan, there are a total of 89,500 policemen, out of which 1,541 cops are deployed for the security of 471 protected persons (PP) which include ministers, MPs, MLAs, judges, bureaucrats etc.
 
 The state police department makes its own rules and uses cops to provide personal security. “A person facing a life threat is given security if he doesn’t fall into the category of MPs, MLAs, judges and bureaucrats,” said a senior officer without elaborating much on the nitty-gritties.
