GURUGRAM: DHBVN is dragging its feet on the issue of   of Gurgaon circle into two smaller circles that could have addressed the issue of deficient manpower and equitable power sharing. Sources said a proposal was mooted at the board meeting in September last year, but lack of interest on the part of senior discom officials have led to an inordinate delay.

 “The total number of consumers in Gurgaon circle is nearing 4 lakh, which is a lakh more than the ideal number of consumers per operation circle. So, the operation creation of another circle was suggested at the board meeting by the power discom’s senior administration. The aim is to cater to the increasing number of consumers in the district,” a senior official told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 “While the management has decided in-principle to undertake the project, it is delaying its implementation as some higher-ups are not showing any interest in the same,” he added.
 
 It is estimated that power demand across Gurgaon is likely to peak 3,200 MW by 2031 from existing 1,450 MW. If the demand from the upcoming sectors, 58-115, is factored in, then Gurgaon may guzzle up to 5,000 MW of energy by 2031.
