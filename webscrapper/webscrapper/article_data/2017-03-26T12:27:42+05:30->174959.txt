NAGPUR: Around 400 teachers from   (ZP) attended the first day of the two-day workshop on video recording, editing and uploading, held at St Joseph’s Convent near Kasturchand Park, on Saturday. The workshop has been organized by Nagpur district education office. 

 Speaking with TOI, Dipendra Lokhande, district education officer said that apart from Nagpur, teachers from Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia and   district too have registered for the workshop.
 
 “We have not made it compulsory for all the 5000 ZP teachers in the district to attend the workshop. But they should realize the importance of technology in the field of education and be up to date with it,” Lokhande said, adding, “In future we are planning to open video bank, a common platform specifically for ZP teachers where videos made by them can be uploaded. Also syllabus is going to be available in video format and teachers will have to help us in making.”
 
 Shubhangi Pohare, a teacher of Pannalal Devdiya Hindi Primary School said, “We are getting training now but our schools do not have enough computers”
 
 While interacting with the teachers, Dr Rajiv Mohta, principal of Mohta Science College, said, “As a teacher you must always keep on learning. ZP teachers have more responsibilities on them, hence, you have to work harder.” 
 
 Another teacher from Ramtek, Harsha Vaidya said that teachers should keep themselves updated about technology and keep working on their skills to retain children’s attention. “I have seen the change among students after introducing videos as a mode of learning. It is very effective. We cannot make our students imagine everything. Lack of technology has made us lag behind private schools. Thus the need for such workshops is immense,” she said.
