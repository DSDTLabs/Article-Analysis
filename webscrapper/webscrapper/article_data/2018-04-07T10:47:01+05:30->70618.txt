BAMBOLIM: Bidding a tearful adieu to her father B  , daughter   urged people not to hesitate in donating vital organs as it will save many precious lives and create a feeling that their family member is alive somewhere in this world in the form of a recipient.

 “My father would not have taken this decision if he were in my place. But I am confident that he would have loved to do so, if opportunity was given to him,” she said.
 
 “What encouraged me to take this decision was his positive reply to my desire expressed six years ago to donate my eyes,” she said. “Dad had said that it was a noble cause.” Her mother   and brother Shreyash too backed the family decision.
 
 Chetana Hegde, Shreya’s neighbour who accompanied her at the hospital while the organs being transported to the airport, said that the donor always believed in helping others irrespective of their castes and religion. 
 
 She said the government should establish a transplant facility in the state. 
 
 Rao’s liver and two kidneys were flown to a Mumbai hospital, while the corneas were brought to the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital,   for transplant on Friday afternoon.
 
 The final rites on Sadashiv Rao will be performed on Saturday in Vasco, a source said.
