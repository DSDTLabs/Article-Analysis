GREATER NOIDA: An FIR has been registered against two developers in   for allegedly usurping GNIDA’s   and selling it to unsuspecting buyers.

 The FIR under section 420 of the IPC was lodged on July 18 against Solitaire Infomedia Private Limited and Premia Projects Limited for cheating and committing fraud against nearly 3,000 buyers.
 
 The complaint was filed with the GB Nagar Senior Superintendent of Police Love Kumar on the directions of GNIDA’s additional CEO, Janardhan. The   has accused the realtors of usurping its land totalling 60,705 square metres located in Knowledge Park-V and selling it to innocent buyers.
 
 Solitaire Infomedia was allotted the land in 2012. But after taking over the land without the permission of the GNIDA, Premia Projects started selling the project to unsuspecting investors. “We have received complaints from the buyers about the case,” Janardhan said.
 
 “They were promised possession by 2017 but the developer has done only 5-10% construction on the plot. The Solitaire group also owes us Rs 9 crore,” he said.
 
 Buyers said the Premia group was selling space for corporate offices, retail shops, banks, ATMs, restaurants, etc. “A team was formed by the GNIDA to check the complaints we had received and it was found that the authority has not allotted the plot to Premia but the developer was selling space further and cheating people,” the ACEO said.
 
 “We then submitted a report to our chairman, who directed that a police complaint be lodged,” Janardhan said. “A complaint was filed against Tarun Shienh, chairman, Premia group and others,” the official said.
 
 Calls made to the   by this correspondent went unanswered. Officials said that a complaint against the directors of the group was also with the Economic Offences Wing, Delhi. Nearly 80 buyers have approached the agency for reprieve. In May 2016, the Noida Authority had also filed a complaint against the Premia group for cheating and criminal trespassing on its property.
