NEW DELHI:   session 2018 has a dubious distinction - it will have approved a Budget of over Rs 24 lakh crore with members of Parliament spending less than a day of discussion on it.

 
 In this Budget session, conducted in two phases, MPs in   spent only 14 and half hours debating the Budget while   spent even less - 10.9 hours. It's the least amount of time spent by Parliament deliberating the Budget since 2000, for which it was convened.
 
 
  
 In previous sessions, the average amount of time debating the budget has usually been around 20% or 33 hours of the Parliament's allotted time.
 
 In terms of productivity though, 2018 session was the fourth worst. Data by PRS Legislative, which collated session sittings and bills passed from the year 2000, shows that the winter session in 2010 saw even fewer hours of productive work, as did sessions in 2013 and 2016.
 
 The percentage of time utilised by MPs was a staggeringly low of 6% in 2010 while it was barely better in 2013 and 2016 at 15% in Lok Sabha. Rajya Sabha didn't do any better either, using only 2% of available hours in 2010.
 
 The primary scrutiny of the budget is done on the floor of the House through general discussion and detailed deliberations on the demand for grants of various ministries. In the general discussion, the House discusses the budget, which lasted for only a few hours in this budget session. A general discussion is followed by a discussion on demand for grants of specific ministries.
 
 The utilisation of Question Hour has also been low this session. While only 16% of the scheduled time was used to ask questions in Lok Sabha, Upper House fared worse at 5 per cent. The Question Hour is traditionally time utilised by MPs to grill the government on policies and other isses of public interest. It is a way to hold the government accountable for its actions.
