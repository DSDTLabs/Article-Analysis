AHMEDABAD: The two ISIS handlers who allegedly directed the brothers from Rajkot to carry out lone wolf attacks on the famous   in Saurashtra, and Trikonbaug and Gundawadi in Rajkot, are suspected to be Indian, as many chats on encrypted platforms were found to be in Hindi.

 Investigators said they found chats in Hindi with a handler with profile ID Big Cat in which   mentions “muqammal kaam” and “kafir” (work to be accomplished and non-believers), which is used in Hindi or Urdu.
 
 In another chat, Waseem wrote “ Kuch intejar karna hoga” to which the handler also replies “Bhai dekhey kaam aysa hoga ke saman kisi jagah tayar halat mein apko rakha milega”. This suggests that the handler is conversant in Hindi and may be giving directions from within India.
 
 Alleged Indian Mujaheedeen suspect   of Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh had gone to Syria to fight for ISIS. “We are checking with intelligence agencies to see if he is the handler,” said an investigator.
 
 It also emerged that Waseem and   were to flee to Syria or Turkey after executing a major terror attack in the state, an ATS official said.
 
 “We are also checking whether the brothers were involved in any terror attack in the past. We are also interrogating them to know if they have hidden explosives somewhere,” added an ATS official.
