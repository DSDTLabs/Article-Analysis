ALLAHABAD: Even as   Narendra Modi's   is yet to yield results two-and-a-half-years after its launch, a British-era set of bylaws that laid the foundation for construction of toilets in city, is still being followed as a standard across the country. 

 To do away with the menace of open defecation and urinating in the open, the British government had set the standard for the construction of separate toilets for male and female workers, reveals a set of documents from the year 1937 which have been added to regional archive office here recently.
 
 Regional archive officer,   told TOI, "On August 14, 1937, Britons had devised a set a standards and gave it legal backing by framing a law called, 'Bylaws to control the construction of new factory building and the alteration or adoption of existing one'. While under the Swachch Bharat campaign there is no one to supervise the initiatives launched by the central government, the British government had created a post called the 'Medical officer for health' to strictly implement the law."
 
 The bylaws called for separate toilets for male and female employees in all workplaces and it was mandatory to specify in writing whether the toilets were meant for males or females. There was also a provision of a fine in case of non-compliance with rules. 
 
 As per the rule, an establishment with 25 employees should have two toilets, three toilets for an office building employing up to 50 workers, four for buildings with up to 100 employees and five for offices employing up to 250 people. If a workplace had more than 250 employees then the authority concerned was supposed to construct a toilet for each additional 50 employees. 
 
 The norms were notified in a gazette and mandated that arrangements for ventilation be provided in toilets. "A draft indicates that the decision was taken to ensure hygiene and provide a healthy environment to work in," added Agnihotri.
