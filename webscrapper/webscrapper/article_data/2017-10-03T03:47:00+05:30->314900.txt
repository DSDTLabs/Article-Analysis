Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is all set to hike private water operator Orange City Water (OCW) Private Limited’s rate for sixth consecutive year. It will lead to increase in water tariff for eighth consecutive year. Once approved, the OCW payment will increase to over Rs100 crore per annum. NMC sources told TOI that Nagpur Environmental Services Limited (NESL) is all set to approve hike in OCW rate. “OCW submitted an application seeking increase in its rate from Rs10.72 per unit to Rs11.48 per unit. Scrutiny of the proposed rate has been started,” sources said. The NMC will have to pay Rs103.35 crore per annum to the OCW after increase in rates. At present, the OCW is being paid Rs98 crore per annum at the rate of Rs10.72 per unit. The OCW has miserably failed to ensure equal water distribution to all parts of the city, 24x7 water supply to all households, solve water crisis, contamination of water and reduction in water losses in last five years. The NMC is increasing OCW rate every year and accordingly hiking water tariff with commencement of new fiscal. This is because of flaws in the agreement executed between the NMC and OCW. As per the agreement, the NMC is bound to increase OCW rate if there is any hike in wholesale price index (WPI) and consumer price index (CPI) done by the central government. The OCW rate was not linked with performance or revenue. The WPI and CPI are increased every year. The two parameters were reportedly increased in current fiscal. Therefore, the NMC is all to increase the OCW rate for sixth consecutive year. Unfortunately, the NMC is paying OCW more than its water tariff. When the OCW was roped in, the NMC’s minimum water tariff was Rs5 per unit. But the civic body had agreed to pay Rs7.90 per unit to OCW. At present, the minimum water tariff is Rs7.04 per unit and OCW rate will be Rs11.48 per unit.
