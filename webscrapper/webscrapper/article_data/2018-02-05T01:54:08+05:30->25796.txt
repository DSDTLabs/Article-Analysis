NEW DELHI: Fearing  , the   of those   of   left their house in B-Block of Raghubir Nagar   on Saturday. Their decision came in the wake of Ankit’s girlfriend’s maternal aunt being told to evict the shop from which she was running her beauty parlour.

 Talking to TOI over the phone, the woman’s sister said that they plan to stay away till the situation normalises. “Our friends told us that some people were planning to forcefully oust us from here and it may get violent,” she said. The family is now contemplating about selling their flat in Raghubir Nagar and moving to their native place.
 
 They are yet to meet the four family members accused of murdering Ankit. They have also been unable to communicate with the woman who is in a shelter home under police protection. Neighbours said that in the evening the family loaded their belongings in a pickup truck and left.
 
 The area continued to remain tense amid heavy force deployment on Sunday. Police and paramilitary forces were stationed in all the lanes and patrols were being conducted on a regular basis.
 
 Life in the colony was otherwise normal. The markets were crowded and people came out to sit in the park. Drum beats sounded in a lane next to the Saxena house announcing that a wedding was being celebrated. The hot topic of discussion, however, was Ankit’s murder.
 
 RWA members said that they will be organising a candlelight march on Monday evening in Ankit’s memory. They added that they will request police to shift the beat box of local cops on to the main road.
 
  “The police beat box is located inside a park. We want it shifted to the main road as many anti-social elements use it for drinking. A lot of snatching incidents have occurred here,” said an RWA member.
