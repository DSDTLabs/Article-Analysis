PANAJI: The three-member committee of cabinet ministers on Wednesday decided to exempt 1,021 licences from the Supreme Court’s highway   ban. Urban development minister Francis D’Souza said the committee will submit its recommendations to the finance department.

 “We expect to complete the whole process in the next 15 days and the excise department will renew the licences in question,” D’Souza said.
 
 As many as 1,332 licences were not renewed for the current financial year due to the ban. The government constituted a ministerial committee after the   relaxed its order in February, leaving it to the discretion of state governments, but with certain conditions, to exempt licences operating within 500m of either a national or state highway.
 
 D’Souza said that after the recommendations are vetted by the law department, the process to renew licences would start.
 
 Regarding the remaining 311 licences, D’Souza said they would be examined on a case-to-case basis, and only after that a decision will be taken.
 
 The committee suggested that 1,021 licences be renewed on the basis of certain criteria such as distance of the village from urban areas, development of the village, if the population is over 5,000.
 
 After the Supreme Court order in December 2016, the Goa excise department conducted a survey to determine licences located within the prohibited areas. About 3,200 licences, such as retail, wholesaler, taverns, hotels, bars and restaurants functioning within 500m of either a national or state highway, were not renewed.
 
 But some licences came to be renewed subsequently, after the Supreme Court modified its own order allowing some licences to be renewed.
 
 Until the ban came into effect, Goa had about 11,500 licences in operation. It dropped below the 10,000 mark in April 2017 when licences in prohibited areas were not renewed.
 
 The state government was under immense pressure from the liquor lobby to find a solution to the problem.
