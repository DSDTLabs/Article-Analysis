Actress Anupama Parameswaran's latest film in Malayalam, Jomonte Suviseshangal, is yet to hit screens, but the actress has already taken up another big project in Telugu. 

 Her next film, directed by Sukumar, has Ram Charan in the lead and the movie will go on floors next month. The actress apparently pipped Rashi Khanna, Amala Paul and Samantha to bag the film! 
 A source close to the project says, 'The film's shoot will happen in various parts of India and the rest of the details about the crew will be finalised soon after Sankranti.'
 
 Meanwhile, we also hear that Anupama opted out of a Malayalam project to allot time for this film. 'It was a good project but she couldn't take it up as the dates were clashing with that of the Ram Charan film. As of now, she hasn't committed to any other Malayalam project as well,' says a source in the know.
