PATNA: All the 30 police personnel, including SHO  , posted at Beur police station have been shunted to the police lines for their failure to enforce prohibition and connivance with liquor smugglers in their area. Inspector   has been made the SHO of Beur police station.

 Acting on the recommendation of DIG (central range) Shalin, Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj sent them to the police lines on Friday. The DIG had received complaints about illegal liquor trade in Beur area in connivance with the local police.
 
 This is the second incident in the state after Gopalganj that action has been taken against all the cops posted at a police station. Gopalganj SP   had suspended all the policemen posted at Town police station on August 18 last year following the hooch tragedy at Khajurwani which had claimed 15 lives.
 
 “Following the complaints, it was prima facie found that the liquor smugglers were active in the area in connivance with Beur police station cops,” Shalin said, adding that the zero tolerance policy towards illegal liquor trade would continue. He said police personnel found lax in enforcing prohibition would not be spared.
 
 SSP said  , along with six sub-inspectors, two assistant sub-inspectors and 21 constables were lines closed on immediate basis. He also said a separate investigations would be conducted by City SP (West) Ravindra Kumar against them. 
 
 Sources said on January 28, some of the policemen at Beur police station set free liquor smugglers while SHO Pandey was on leave. Pandey had gone on leave on January 26 evening and joined duty on January 30.
 
 Meanwhile, City SP (West) said investigation into allegations for setting the liquor smuggler free has been initiated and the probe report would be submitted very soon.
