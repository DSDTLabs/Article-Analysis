GAYA: Expressing concern over worsening condition of river  ,   MP   has sent letters to chief minister   and Union minister for water resources Nitin Gadkari on Thursday to prevent further dipping of sub-surface water. 

 Besides demanding linking of Falgu with river Sone, Manjhi also identified three factors which cause permanent damage to the river. The three factors are encroachment, flow of city's drain effluents and other pollutants in the river bed and indiscriminate sand mining.
 
 Manjhi, through his letter, also suggested an eco- friendly crematorium for protecting the river from hazards of wooden pyres used for burning of bodies on the river banks. Though some initiative was taken in the past for the development of eco- friendly crematorium, the idea could not be fully materialised.
 
 On the issue of encroachments, the letter stated that encroachment on either side of the river bank has narrowed its width. The MP's letter also stated that discharge of drain effluents affect the river's sanctity. “It is no ordinary river as hundreds of thousands of Hindu devotees from the country and outside visit the river bank and perform rituals using river water and as such use of polluted water for sacred ritual performances was an anachronism. The issue has to be addressed on a priority basis,” Manjhi said.
 
 On the issue of sand mining, the letter stated that indiscriminate sand mining is causing permanent damage to Falgu. Hence rationalisation of the sand mining exercise is necessary, he said.
