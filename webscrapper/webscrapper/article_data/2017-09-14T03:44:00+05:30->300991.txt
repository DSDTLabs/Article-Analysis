Panaji: As four states and one Union Territory have brought down pendency of more than 10-year-old court cases to just one percent of their total pending cases, Goa has also been fast catching up. More than a decade old cases form just 4.4% of the total   in Goa’s district courts now, a huge improvement since May 2016.

 Of the close to 44,000 total pending cases in Goa’s district courts, now only 1,934 cases - 1,829 civil and 105 criminal - are over 10 years old, according to the latest statistics of the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG). In May 2016, close to 8,000 cases that are more than a decade old were pending in the state’s district courts.
 
 Though Goa meets the law commission's criteria of 50 judges per 10 lakh population, the rate at which new cases are filed is high, leading to increasing pendency. The number of cases pending in Goa's courts had swollen by an astonishing 20,000 in less than three years from October 2013 to May 2016.
 
 Since close monitoring of the pendency of cases in states began under initiatives of the Supreme Court’s e-committee, including launching of the NJDG, there has been a drastic reduction in the pendency of cases. In Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Chandigarh, cases pending for more than 10 years now form less than one percent of the total pending cases.
 
 In Goa, the total number of pending cases has also reduced by close to 18,000 since May 2016, when 60,776 cases were pending in the district courts. Goa's pendency figures that were the worst among the smaller states until last year now seem to be rapidly improving.
 
 In August itself, 2,516 of the total cases pending in Goa and 160 pending for more than 10 years were disposed of.
 
 On an average, around 900 civil and approximately 1,500 criminal cases are disposed of each month in Goa's courts, according to NJDG data.
