BENGALURU: Digital payments and commerce platform   is in talks with curated events platform  .in to pick up a majority stake in the Mumbai based company, said people aware of the development. This would be one of the largest external investments made by Paytm if the deal materialises.

 The Noida-based company is expected to pump up to $30 million into Insider.in, sources told TOI. Typically, Paytm invests $5-7 million in other  . “Paytm is in active discussions with the Vijay Nair-led firm as it wants to take on rivals like BookMyShow's events business,“ a source said. Insider.in is owned by Only Much Louder (OML), one of the leading ticketing platforms in the country for a wide range of events and properties like Bacardi NH7 Weekender and TV series The Dewarists.
 
 “Paytm wants to get a pie of the events business, which is a natural extension given it is already present in the movie ticketing space. They are interested in Insider for its youth-oriented base of users,“ a person familiar with the matter told TOI. If the talks go through, the Alibababacked company will get a majority stake in Insider.in and not in its parent company .
