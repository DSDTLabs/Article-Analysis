Pune: Two men driving in a multi-utility vehicle (MUV) staged an audacious carjacking in   early on Thursday. 

 The unidentified men — brandishing a sharp weapon — employed a diversionary tactic and made off with the sedan worth Rs3 lakh.
 
 Ashok Darvatkar, a   residing in Sangamwadi, has lodged a complaint with the Yerawada police, who have launched a manhunt. 
 
 In the early hours of Thursday, Darvatkar had planned a visit to Narayanpur in Purandar Taluka with a friend. 
 
 “Around 4.15am, Darvatkar had parked his car along a road in Yerawada and was waiting for his friend,” assistant inspector S A Jamdade told TOI on Friday. 
 
 Darvatkar was looking at his cellphone when an MUV came to a halt nearby. A masked man got out of the car, came towards Darvatkar, snatched his cellphone and threw it away. 
 
 Noticing a sharp weapon in the masked man’s hand, a shocked Darvatkar chose not to pick up a quarrel. Instead, he went to retrieve his cellphone. 
 
 However, he had forgotten the car keys in the ignition mode. The masked man, much to Darvatkar’s dismay, got into the driver’s seat of the car and sped away.
 
 “The MUV, in which the other man was waiting, followed Darvatkar’s car,” Jamdade said. Jamdade added that Darvatkar was not able to make a note of the MUV’s registration number as the number plate was broken.
