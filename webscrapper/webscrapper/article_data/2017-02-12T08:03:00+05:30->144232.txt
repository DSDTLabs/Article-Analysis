GURUGRAM/DHARUSHERA: Two-wheeler frames manufacturer Omax Autos has hit back at the sacked workers, claiming the company suffered huge losses due to their “unprofessional approach” and the termination of their services through the respective contractors had nothing to do with demonetisation.

 “There were instances when the workers exhibited irresponsible behaviour and were motivated for all the wrong causes,” said Mansha Urrahman Waris, a spokesperson for Omax.
 
 After Omax, on February 1, terminated contracts with six contractors through whom 351 workers were hired by the company for its Dharuhera plant, the sacked workers had approached the labour department, alleging they were made to work overtime and   right before a raise was due. The labour department has sought a response from Omax.
