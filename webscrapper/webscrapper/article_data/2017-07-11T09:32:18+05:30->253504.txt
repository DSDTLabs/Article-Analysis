MUMBAI: Three state associations of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have sent a notice to the Board, protesting about the last-minute scheduling of the Special General Meeting (SGM) of the   in New Delhi on Tuesday to discuss the implementation of the Lodha reforms. Apparently, the cricket associations of Saurashtra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala have put voiced strong reservations and have claimed that it will be held without a mandatory 10-day notice. A top Board official, however, dismissed the concerns of these state units.

 “There was an SGM called on December 25, 2002 after a four-day notice. So there is a precedent there,” he revealed. It must be noted here that the   and the   were headed by BCCI stalwarts Niranjan Shah and N Srinivasan respectively, who are both above 70. The special committee formed by the BCCI to see how fast the reforms can be implemented has recommended accepting the reform which says that those above 70 should be disqualified to hold any office bearer's post in the Board.
 
 Meanwhile, BCCI secretary Amitabh Chaudhary admitted that the Board was going through a “crisis” in the last two years in view of the non-implementation of the Lodha reforms after the Supreme Court accepted them. “Yes, it's been a trying time for us, collectively,” said Chaudhary at the Legends Club function to mark the birthday of legendary opening batsman Sunil Gavaskar at the Cricket Club of India here on Monday evening.”
 
 “There is an inertia (in the Board about accepting the reforms or accepting change),” he admitted and stated that he was personally not against reforms. Committee of Administrators (COA) member and former India women's skipper Diana Eduljee, however, assured that the “implementation of the reforms would happen” in due course.
