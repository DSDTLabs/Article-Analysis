VADODARA: Based on a petition filed by a candidate contesting in the   of M S University’s senate body, Gujarat high court (HC) has issued notices to 35 respondents, including M S University, its vice-chancellor and registrar and industrialists   and Amit Patel among others. 

 The notices are returnable on January 30. Petitioner Prataprao Bhoite, president of  , had filed a special civil application in the high court seeking its directives to   to declare names of 31 respondents mentioned as donors in the electoral roll as “illegal, invalid and without authority of law”. 
 
 Bhoite in his petition has stated that the electoral roll prepared by the university incorporates names of 31 people as donors who haven’t made any donation to the university. 
 
 “This amounts to usurping and overreaching the powers of the syndicate – the executive authority under the M S University Act of 1949 and is in clear departure of procedural impropriety,” states the petition. 
 
 The petitioner has also pleaded before the court to issue directives to the university to keep aside the votes that are cast or franchised by the 31 respondents separately in a sealed cover till the court issues further directives. 
 
 He has also prayed that the result of the election which are scheduled on February 9 should not be declared till the final outcome of the petition.
