GURGAON: In a city that sees a hit-and-run accident almost every day, traffic police have finally decided to tighten the noose around road rule violators by strictly implementing the  's order last year to suspend licences of reckless drivers for at least three months. The cops have zeroed in on five offences that will result in violators' licences getting withheld after it was found more than 50% of deaths in road accidents across Gurgaon in 2016 took place due to blatant violation of these five traffic rules.

 Data available with the department suggests that around 420 people were killed in as many as 377 fatal accidents reported from different parts of Gurgaon last year. Half of those deaths -210 out of 420 -were caused by five types of violations enlisted in the apex court order -carrying more passeng ers than permitted, using mobile phones while driving, speeding, drunken driving and jumping traffic signal. “While speeding killed more than 33% of the people in accidents, drunk driving was the cause behind 14% mishap deaths. Jumping traffic signals made up for another 4-5% deaths. Sadly, those who died not only included violators but also innocent people, who were hit by offenders. These figures are alarming and call for urgent steps,“ said Sibash Kabiraj, joint commissioner of police, Gurgaon.
 
 The traffic police will now step up vigil across the district and confiscate the driving licence of any driver who violates any of these five basic road rules even for once. “We will seize the licence and send it to the  's office, which is the licensing authority. Thereafter, the SDM's office will issue a notice and the licence will be suspended for three months,'' Kabiraj added.
