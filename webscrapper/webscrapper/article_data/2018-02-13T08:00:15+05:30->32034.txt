KOLKATA:   has barely managed to hold on to its forest cover, even though green cover in   has actually depleted, states the India State of Forest Report, 2017.

 The total forest cover in the state has gone up by 21 sq km, from 16,826 sq km in 2015 to 16,847 sq km in 2017. Most of it is owing to spurt in plantation activities outside forest areas.
 
 Green cover inside forest areas, including the wildlife sanctuaries and reserve forest zones, has dipped from 7,136 sq km to 7,134 sq km in two years.
  
  
 While very   in the state has grown by 51 sq km during this period, moderately dense forest cover and open forest cover have gone down by 20 sq km and 1 sq km respectively. Bengal forest minister Binay Burman said patrolling inside the protected areas was being intensified to check illegal activities like tree felling. “We can’t plant trees inside protected areas. Hence, we undertake such activities under social forestry schemes outside recorded forest areas,” he added.
 
 The forest cover in Darjeeling stood at 2,365 sq km, a decrease by 11 sq km since 2015. Districts in tribal areas of the state, though, have recorded a 22 sq km rise in forest cover, revealed the report which comes in every two years.
 
 
 
 
 Extent of waterbodies within forest area has also gone up from 82 sq km in 2005 to 104 sq km in 2015, a jump of 27%.
 
 India’s forest cover has increased by 6778 sq km, up by .21% since 2015, to 7,08,273 sq km, which is about 21.5% of the total geographical area of the country.
 
 Top five states where maximum forest cover increased are Andhra Pradesh (2,141 sq km), Karnataka (1,101 sq km), Kerala (1,043 sq km), Odisha (885 sq km) and Telangana (565 sq km).
 
 There are 15 states and union territories where the forest cover is more than a third of the geographical area. Of them, seven states/UTs have more than three-fourth forest cover. About 40% of the country’s forest cover is present in nine large contiguous patches of 10,000 sq km or more.
 
 But what is disturbing is the loss of green cover in the north-east. Five states — Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Meghalaya — have recorded a decrease in forest cover owing to multiple reasons including shifting cultivation (jhum), diversion of forest land for developmental activities, submergence of forest cover, agriculture expansion and natural disasters.
