Television host Lasya is engaged to her long time beau Manjunath on January 30. Though she announced her engagement via her social media account, the popular host chose to keep it under wraps about whom she is set to be engaged. Later, after a day, she posted a few pictures from the engagement ceremony and the couple looked so adorable together. Manjunath is a Marathi guy and the duo have been madly in love with each other ever since they have met. The pictures on her social media account suggest that they have been in love for a longtime and even got their names tattooed on each other. Lasya was missing on television shows for a while. Now that the anchor is all set to tie the knot, let us hope to see her back doing shows.
