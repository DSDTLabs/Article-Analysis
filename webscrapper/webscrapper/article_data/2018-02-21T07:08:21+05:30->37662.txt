AHMEDABAD: What makes   to  ? It’s not just about communication but also about identity,  , and development. The rich tapestry of a region’s language also gives a peek into unique culture and traditions which cannot be translated into any other tongue.

 As the United Nations celebrates February 21 as the  , linguists in Gujarat talk on the theme of this year: linguistic diversity and multilingualism count for sustainable development.
 
 Professor Kanji Patel, who edited People’s Linguistic Survey of India (PLSI)’s tome on Gujarati, said that the state is home to about 25 dialects exclusive to forest-dwelling Adivasis (tribals) and 45 to nomadic tribes. “Apart from Gujarati, one can find traces of five other linguistic families having its roots in Africa and Europe,” he said. “A language is like amoeba, constantly changing its shape to adapt to the environment.”
 
 Patel said that a number of these dialects are on the verge of extinction. “We cannot focus on language without people speaking it.” He said the nomadic tribes are struggling to even exercise their basic rights. “We recently had to go to the local administration in Modasa when a Nat family, the custodians of age-old songs and art, was displaced by land mafia,” he said. “The major areas of tribal population with the highest linguistic diversity are facing problems such as displacement and the onslaught of modernity.” 
 
 Activists advocate a new look at the education system, pointing to the fact that a tribal child is more often than not encouraged to converse in Gujarati in formal schools. Efforts, however, are on by institutions like Bhasha, established by Professor Ganesh Devy, to study and document indigenous languages.
