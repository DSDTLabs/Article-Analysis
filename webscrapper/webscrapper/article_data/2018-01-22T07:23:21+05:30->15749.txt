SECUNDERABAD: Stagnant drains, vacant plots serving as dump yards, herd of pigs rummaging on the garbage heaps - it is a common sight for the residents of   in Secunderabad. 

 Even as the state government brags about proper implementation of 'Swachh Bharat' in Hyderabad, poor sanitation in this part of the city is not only presenting a hygiene issue but also government apathy. 
 
 While entering from   road towards  , one can notice drain filled with garbage and a vacant piece of defence land turned into a dumping spot. 
 
 AK  , a retired government employee and resident of Manasarovar Heights Apartments lamented, "The residents here are at the receiving end. Despite several complaints to the GHMC, no action has been taken so far. Since it is a defence land,   officials say they cannot intervene, and when defence personnel were approached they expressed their inability saying only the   has the authority to take action on the land."
 
 Several residents have complained of people and vendors, from outside the locality, throwing garbage in the plots at night. Even as the private plot was covered with corrugated metal boundary recently, the vacant defence land and other plots are still being filled with garbage and piggeries. Many locals have even seen vehicles off-loading debris from construction sites into plots which have an old age home and a school in its vicinity. "Since there are no dustbins, people throw the garbage in the open ," said Singh.
 
 Another resident,   felt that it was a move by realtors to encroach upon the land. "The garbage is purposely dumped at the vacant plots near the Boin Cheruvu bed so as to grab the land. The dump also attracts stray animals and serves as breeding ground for mosquitoes," he complained.
