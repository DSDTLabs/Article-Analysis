Puducherry: The human   division of the Pondicherry institute of medical sciences ( ) has established a cytogenetic laboratory for diagnosing disorders in   (that contain the genetic information for growth and development) from samples taken from blood and bone marrow of patients.

 Any change in the number or structure of chromosomes can lead to various non-reversible defects. 
 
 The laboratory, which is equipped to identify chromosomal abnormalities, will help in treating blood cancer and long-standing anemia. The lab can also undertake molecular cytogenetic study — fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) — to define some blood cancer conditions. 
 
 The human genetics division of the institute has already started genetic counselling for the various chromosomal conditions and single gene disorders, consanguineous marriages and specific syndromes with a genetic background. 
 
 The laboratory will also serve as an additional tool to manage different conditions both in adults and children like conditions of mental retardation such as Down’s syndrome, multiple birth anomalies, learning difficulties, autism, seizures, sexual disorders, multiple abortions, and genital abnormalities where sex identification in the newborn is problematic.
