HYDERABAD: Twenty five-year-old Chandan   has punched and grappled his way to success at state and national-level wrestling championships, but when it comes to assistance from the state government he has known only bitter failure.

 The ace wrestler has won many laurels for the state and even   medals at national championships since 2008, but he feels wrestlers are neglected in terms of government awards and sops when compared to other sports.
 
 A resident of Devi Nagar in Jumeraat Bazaar, Singh said he has been struggling to continue with his sporting dreams due to lack of sufficient finances. “With the hope of becoming a top wrestler in the country, I started participating in championships since 2007. One after another, I managed to win gold, silver and bronze medals for the state. But in return, I got nothing from the state government,” said Singh.
 
 “I had to undergo a lot of suffering owing to certain problems. Despite this, I took part in wrestling competitions held in different parts of the country. Though financial problems created hurdles for me, my mother’s blessing and encouragement from other family members helped me in my journey,” said Singh.
 
 Chandan Singh’s mother   runs a small kirana store near their house. With three daughters and two sons to look after, she says she does not earn enough to continue supporting Chandan’s dreams.
 
 “I have a great responsibility on my shoulders of marrying off my three daughters. Despite this, I pay attention towards my son. If he achieves or becomes something, we hope to get help. I appeal to the Telangana government to ensure facilities to my son on par with others players,” she said.
 
 Singh said he also wants to participate in international championships, but cannot afford to do so due to financial problems.
