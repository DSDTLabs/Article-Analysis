NEW DELHI: The  's landmark   judgment mandating every office to set up a committee to deal with women employees' complaints about sexual harassment at the workplace has surprisingly not travelled 5 km in 20 years to reach   district courts. 

 With the judiciary preaching strict adherence to law and the need to punish violators, a bench of Chief Justice   and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud realised on Friday that neither the 20-year-old Vishaka judgment nor the five-year-old Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, has stirred district courts to set up committees to deal with complaints from women advocates and employees.
 
 A complaint by a woman advocate, who was alleged to have been manhandled by fellow advocates for attempting to attend court on May 4 when the lawyers had struck work over a decision to demolish the chamber complex and rebuild it, brought this anomaly to the fore and stirred the CJI-led bench to take remedial measures, not only in the district court complexes in Delhi but across India.
 
 The bench asked the acting chief justice of Delhi high court to constitute committees for all district courts in Delhi as per the Vishaka judgment and the 2013 Act and said no advocate or person who had a criminal case pending against him or her should be a member of such panels. 
 
 The 'harassed' woman lawyer had moved the SC, which a few days ago had ordered the   to provide her security as she alleged she was constantly threatened by members of the district bar association. When the matter was taken up on Friday, the CJI's courtroom was packed with members of the district bar, who had turned up in large numbers to show solidarity with advocates named by the woman lawyer in her complaint. A cross FIR was lodged against the complainant by another woman lawyer, allegedly a junior of one of the lawyers accused of manhandling the woman, for theft.
