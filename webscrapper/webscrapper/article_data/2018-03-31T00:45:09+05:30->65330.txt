Tirunelveli: A 28-year-old man, who was wanted in many cases including burglary and robbery, died after he allegedly got injured in an accident. Police sources said that the historysheeter, N Murugesan, 28, of Ullaasa Nagar near Kodarankulam, was injured in the accident late on Thursday evening and died while undergoing treatment at the Tirunelveli Medical College and Hospital (TVMCH) on Friday evening.

 Denying rumours of custodial death, the police said that the cause of death could be ascertained only in the post-mortem. They added that a detailed probe had been ordered into the incident. Murugesan and his accomplice, Manickaraja alias Raja, have been facing various charges in Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari districts. A few days ago a gold chain weighing seven sovereigns was snatched from a woman at Sivanthipatti on the outskirts of the city. During inquiry, the police narrowed down their suspicion on Raja and Murugesan and were on the lookout for them.
 
 According to the police version, around 7 pm on Thursday, the duo was riding a bike when on seeing the police patrol vehicle, they tried to escape. The bike met with an accident on the Madurai - Kanyakumari NH. Police arrested Manickaraja and he was remanded to judicial custody at Palayamkottai central prison the same day. The police claimed that Murugesan suffered a fractured leg and other injuries. A senior police officer said that he suffered an epileptic attack before he died. tnn
