HYDERABAD: Post Friday’s heavy showers, which threw traffic into disarray and flooded entire road stretches in the Cyberabad area, residents of the IT belt point out that the same situation plays out each year and have called for immediate action to revamp the area’s drainage system.

 According to the Cyberabad traffic police department, Madhapur has the highest number of critical waterlogging points in the West Zone, followed by Kukatpally.
 
 
 A few critical waterlogging points identified in Cyberabad include   junction, opposite Shilparamam, Patrika T junction, Mindspace Rotary to TCS junction, Kukatpally Y junction, RTA office in Kondapur, Godrej Y-junction in front of IOC petrol bunk, Prashanth Nagar bus stop and all the ‘turning points’ near Metro stations at Kukatpally and  . “Severe waterlogging not only disrupts traffic and power, but also takes a toll on roads. Despite being laid several times over, the condition of roads in Cyberabad area continues to worsen whenever the city records rainfall activity,” pointed out Madhapur resident  .
 
 “At Bhandari Layout in  , waterlogging is a serious concern with even the cellars of apartment buildings getting flooded even after short spells of rain. The same situation has been playing out for the past three years or so and authorities have done precious little to arrest waterlogging in this area,” said Ram C.
 
 Residents of areas such as Miyapur and KPHB Colony in Kukatpally, where inundated homes and swamped roads are a common sight during monsoons, rued how most of GHMC’s plans to clear encroachments on nalas and widen the storm water drains, still remain only on paper.
 
 As per an analysis carried out by the   ( ) in 2017, the maximum number of critical bottlenecks on drains were identified in the West Zone (400). The Kukatpally-Moosapet hydraulic zone was identified as the worst-affected, with 318 of the total critical bottlenecks being located there.
