Lucknow: Passengers at   railway station will soon see their PNR details on swanky   screens. 

 To be set up in a kiosk outside the station managerâ€™s room, these screens will display the status of coach for passengers with confirmed   while they will show RAC and waiting list status for the others along with train name and number. 
 
 The construction work for these screens has begun. According to officials from Northern Railway, the installation will be complete soon.
 
 The display will be in eight columns. The first and second columns will display the status of the ticket at the time of booking. The third column will show the current status. The fourth and fifth columns will show the name of the train in English and Hindi. Columns six and seven will display the coach and seat number. The passenger's name and PNR will be shown in the last column.
 
 The large sheets of paper stuck to the display board four hours before the departure of a train for the same information, however, will continue to exist.
 
 An official from Northern Railway said the installation of LED screens was mentioned during the recent visit of the chairman of the Railway Board AK Mittal to the city.

 LED screens have been installed at Charbagh railway station to display all relevant information related to the arrival and departure of trains. This includes running status and routes covered. In addition, all trains headed to a particular destination will be grouped together, making it easy for passengers to locate their trains. 
 
 Earlier, people had to either stand in long queues at inquiry counters to get information or look at display boards which railway staff used to update. The process was a time-consuming one as all work was manual. Now, LED screens will be updated in real time simultaneously by staff in the control room.
