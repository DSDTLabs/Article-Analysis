GANDHINAGAR: State home and prohibition minister Pradipsinh Jadeja during a discussion on prohibition amendment law hinted on Wednesday that liquor was available in the official quarters given to MLAs.

 During the discussion, senior   Shaktisinh Gohil said that a check should begin from Gandhinagar circuit house and demanded that all the MLAs entering the assembly hall should be sniffed.
 
 This led to a major uproar in the house and deputy chief minister Nitin Patel said that this was an insult of all the 182 MLAs who are members of the assembly. He even demanded an apology from Gohil.
 
 Jadeja said, “I hold the home department portfolio. I am ready to order surprise checks at the official quarters of MLAs and also bring it on record how many bottles of liquor are found.”
 
 Nitin Patel said that there was no tradition to check the MLAs and if they were frisked, the Congress MLAs would not be able to enter the house with banners and placards.
 
 This led to an uproar and both the   and the Congress MLAs started trading charges. Even the women members demanded an apology, stating that the minister had alleged that the women MLAs also come drunk to the house.
