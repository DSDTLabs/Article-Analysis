After working last on ' ', actor   has teamed up with   for a short film together. Titled ' ', the Hindi-English film is a series of firsts — Vivek’s directorial debut and Purvi’s first short.

 Purvi, who grew up in Pune, says, “Vivek sir had spoken to me about his direction plans. He was keen on casting me in his first project. The concept interested me, and I saw it as a great opportunity to work with him again.” Purvi will be seen playing the lead in the film along with 
 Abhilash Kumar. 
 
 Without divulging much about the project, Vivek says that the film is centred around the issue of eve-teasing. He adds, “It is very light in terms of its treatment. Frankly, we aren’t trying to address a problem through our film, but as entertainers, if your content has a message, it does go a long way in sensitising the masses.”
 
 Shot in Mumbai over two days, the film is currently in post-production. It will take a while before we hear more about it. “If our film helps start a dialogue about the issue, nothing would make us happier,” says Vivek, who intends to write and direct more shorts.
