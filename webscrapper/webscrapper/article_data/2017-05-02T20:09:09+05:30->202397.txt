DEHRADUN: A delegation under the aegis of Kesar Jan Kalyan Samiti (KJKS) met the authorities at KV IIP school in Mokampur on Tuesday to demand restoration of evening classes.   N K Gusain, president of KJKS, said, “We had written to the HRD ministry but this time we are conveying our request to them through the school authorities. We want a second shift in the school so that more children can study there.”    The school authorities said that there were valid reasons to end the second shift. Somit Shrivastav, deputy commissioner, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Dehradun region, told TOI, “The school is close to the forest area and CCTV footage has spotted leopards in the evening hours. We do not want to put children at risk. Also, running two shifts will be difficult. We do not want to compromise on the quality of education by reducing the hours of the classes.”    Shrivastav said, “Earlier, we had two shifts due to lack of infrastructure but now we have the space and classrooms to accommodate all students. The HRD ministry had approved the merger of two shifts.”
