 had a shoe thrown at her while she was performing at a gig in Boston but the singer-actor said she took the act as a compliment. 
The 36-year-old artiste posted a video on   showing her having a shoe thrown at her while singing her hit "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" from the movie 'Dreamgirls' at a concert. 
 
 
  
  
 Hudson, who started the shoe-throwing ritual at her first season as mentor on 'The Voice', appeared pleased by facing the same fate. She said, "I told my crew I said lot of people are going to start throwing shoes at me and ya that just what happened tonight!"
 
 "I got my first shoe thrown at me tonight! lol I could barely finish my song after this guy got done! Lol too much! I love it!! #boston". The shoe, however, was thrown by her bandmate rather than an audience member. 
 
 Hudson had thrown her own shoe on stage during one of 'The Voice' contestants' blind audition and said, "Where I come from, that's a compliment, and we know at times when you sing like that, you better be prepared to what? Duck." 
 
 The singer also talked about the incident on 'Late Night With  ', saying, "It is a compliment. At J Hud Productions, it is a compliment. If you move me enough that I remove my shoe to throw it at you, you have done something amazing. It is equivalent to a standing ovation."
