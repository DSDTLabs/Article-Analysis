IDUKKI: Chief minister   on Wednesday termed his helicopter trip as “natural” and that the CM needn’t know from which account the expenses are met.

 Inaugurating the conclusion of the CPM Idukki district conference at Kattappna, he added that there was no need to create a controversy on the issue.
 
 “Some are trying to portray that the chief minister committed a theft on the chopper ride issue. On some occasions, the chief minister should make these types of trips. Normally, the public administration department pays for the travelling expenses of the chief minister and other ministers,” he said. 
 
 “Only on Tuesday evening, I realized that the money for the trip was paid from the disaster management account. Immediately I directed the officials to make the payment from the public administration account instead,” said Pinarayi.
 
 “Normally, the officials decide to make the payment. In future, the chief minister should also need to know about this,” he added.
 
 On the proposed Neelakurinji sanctuary, he said the common man’s interests would be protected. “Protection of Neelakurnji and the sanctuary are important. The government has already completed the ministerial committee verification of the sanctuary area. At the same time, it will protect the interests of the farmers in Idukki,” said Vijayan.
 
 “Title deed issue is a major problem in Idukki. The government would distribute title deeds to all eligible farmers in the district in a time-bound manner. However, no encroachment will be allowed on government land. Munnar is the pride of the state and the government would protect it,” he said.
 
 Power minister M M Mani, Devikulam MLA S Rajendran, Idukki MP Joyce George, CPM Idukki district secretary K K  , CPM state committee member K P Mary and   district president C V Varghese also attended the function. 
 
 As part of the district conference, over 10,000 party members took part in the red volunteer march at
