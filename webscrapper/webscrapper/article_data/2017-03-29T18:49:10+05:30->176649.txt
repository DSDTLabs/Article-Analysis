NEW DELHI: The Centre today said it "want(s) to make clear" that   isn't mandatory for the poor to get welfare scheme benefits.

 "The   itself permitted delivery of many pro-poor initatives via application of Aadhaar, but (we) want to make it clear it's not mandatory," said Union minister  , reported ANI
 
 The apex court said yesterday that having an Aadhaar card cannot be made mandatory by the government for giving out benefits from its welfare schemes. 
 
 The law minister today reiterated that.
 
 "If any person doesn't have Aadhaar, other IDs like ration card and driving licence can be used," he said referring to the kind of IDs that can be presented to collect welfare benefits.
 
 However, making Aadhaar mandatory did get a shot in the arm yesterday, when the top court yesterday said it wouldn't be wrong on the part of the government to make the unique ID mandatory for opening bank accounts and getting mobile connections and passports.
 
 "Minus the benefits under social welfare schemes, we think the government can insist on Aadhaar as identification document. If someone wants to open a bank account or get a mobile phone connection, it can insist on Aadhaar as there is no welfare scheme benefit involved in it. Why cannot the government insist on Aadhaar for filing of income tax returns? For availing benefits under schemes, Aadhaar cannot be insisted, but for other purposes we think it can be," the court said.
 
 Critics have alleged that the   (UIDAI), which runs the Aadhaar scheme, is getting biometric details through private agencies, which violated citizens' fundamental rights.
