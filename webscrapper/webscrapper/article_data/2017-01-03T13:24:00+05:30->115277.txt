JALANDHAR: A 19-year-old youth has been arrested for killing his 17-year-old girlfriend after she told him that she was pregnant and wanted him to marry her. He also buried the body at an isolated spot to try and hide the crime. 

  Sandeep Kaur of Kohala village in Jalandhar had gone missing on December 22. Her parents lodged a complaint with the police on December 25 after making efforts to trace her. Jalandhar (rural) senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sukhminder Singh Mann said the victim was in a relationship with the youth Rajbir Singh. The two had argued over her demand that he marry her when they had last met. 
 
 In the heat of the moment he allegedly hit her on the head with a brick which killed her.
 
 Rajbir was unemployed and was helping his parents in tending to their farm. Sandeep Kaur had left her studies.
 
 Kartarpur deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Arvind Puri said that while lodging a complaint, her parents had pointed a finger at Rajbir as he too had gone missing the same day.
 
 Police traced Rajbir and on Monday morning and he spilled the beans during questioning. He told the police that when they met on December 22, she had insisted that he marry her. He had refused which led to the argument.
 
 "He returned home that day after killing her. In the dead of night he went out, dug a grave at an abandoned place outside the village and carried her body there to bury it," Puri said. 
 
 Police booked Rajbir for murder and destruction of evidence. The body was exhumed by Jalandhar (rural) police on Monday in the presence of an executive magistrate on the basis of information provided by the accused.
