GHAZIABAD: The   district administration on Wednesday formed a three-member committee to look into complaints of indiscriminate   hikes by numerous private schools in the city. The   was formed close on the heels of UP chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath’s directions to curb fee hikes by private schools.

 The Ghaziabad panel was formed a day after the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration formed a committee to study the fee   by all schools in GB Nagar affiliated to CBSE and their system of selling books and school bags inside school premises.
 
 The panel in Ghaziabad comprises ADM (Finance & Revenue) Rajesh Yadav, district basic education officer Lalji Yadav, and district inspector of schools Raj Singh Yadav. The panel will, as a short-term measure, examine complaints and mediate between   and school authorities in a tripartite meeting that is expected to be summoned soon.
 
 The district administration had issued notices to four schools last week following complaints of steep hike in annual fee structures.
 
 District magistrate Nidhi Kesarwani told TOI that there has been no response to those notices. “We will issue them a final notice asking them to explain as to why no-objection certificates provided to them by the district administration should not be revoked following which further course of action will be taken. There are no legal provisions at hand to bar private schools from raising their fees.”
 
 In  , meanwhile, the GB Nagar committee was constituted on Tuesday by district magistrate N P Singh. The panel, led by city magistrate Ramanuj Singh, will include district inspector of schools and basic shiksha adhikari.
 
 According to a statement from the N P Singh’s office, the committee will study the complaints received from parents against each school and submit a report within one week.
