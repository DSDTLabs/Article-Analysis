Nagpur: The Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) has stepped into the leader of opposition controversy in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and asked the city committee to initiate an inquiry and take action against “the 15 corporators who are engaged in defaming the party”. There are totally 29 Congress corporators in the civic body. MPCC general secretary Ganesh Patil, on the directives of president and former CM Ashok Chavan, sent a letter on Tuesday to the city party president Vikas Thakre seeking an inquiry and action. “Some corporators of Congress have created a controversy over the post of group leader, with divisional commissioner. Also, an appeal has been made against the MPCC’s decision in the High Court. It is hurting the party’s image,” said Patil. Thakre told TOI that show cause notices will be issued to 15 corporators. “Sanjay Mahakalkar was appointed the leader of opposition on the recommendation of MPCC observers Naseem Khan and Vinayak Deshmukh. Yet, the 15 corporators approached the divisional commissioner and the high court for a change. The show-cause notice is for this anti-party activity,” he said. The corporators will be given eight days to respond to why their membership in NMC must not be cancelled. “I will submit my report and take action after MPCC’s directives,” he said. Leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve is one of the 15 corporators who is likely to face action. The MPCC appointed Mahakalkar as leader of opposition in March. Divisional commissioner Anup Kumar replaced Mahakalkar with Wanve following an appeal by 17 corporators in May. The MPCC’s latest letter is also sending a clear message that the party supports former Union minister Vilas Muttemwar and Thakre and not former state minister Satish Chaturvedi and the Wanve group that has the support of senior corporator Praful Gudadhe.
