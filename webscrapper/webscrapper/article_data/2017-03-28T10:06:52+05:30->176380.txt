GUMLA:   from different parts of the district on Monday attended the  's (ASA) - Samadhan Sabha to seek solution to problems arising due to amendments in the Chotanagpur Tenancy (CNT) and Santhal Pargana Tenancy Acts (SPT) made by the   government.

 Salkhan Murmu, former MP and national convenor of ASA, a tribal empowerment campaign, said the changes brought in the CNT and SPT Acts will deprive the tribals in the state of their land which is an integral part of their very existence. 
 
 “The changes in the twin acts will empower the government to acquire tribal land, including their agricultural plots, and will cause total eviction of adivasis,” Murmu said, while providing details of the amendments in both the Acts. 
 
 He added that all tribal MLAs should sit together and seek a solution to save the adivasi community in the state. If they failed to do so, he said, they should resign and pull down the present dispensation in the larger interest of the tribal community.
 
 Arun Oraon, ASA state convenor and former IPS officer, alleged that the BJP government was determined to destroy the adivasi community by amending the acts. “The adivasis will not allow the government to execute their plan since they are united with the moolvasis,” he said.
 
 " A large number of adivasis 
 
 will hold a march in   from different parts of Simdega district from April 1 and on April 7 they will reach Morhabadi ground in Ranchi where a huge numbers of adivasis from across the state and representatives from six states including Assam, Odisha and Bengal will congregate to show their solidarity over the issues of land and resident policy," said another state ASA convenor Theodore Kiro.
 
 and what they term as wrong resident policy of the state government in Gumla on Monday.
