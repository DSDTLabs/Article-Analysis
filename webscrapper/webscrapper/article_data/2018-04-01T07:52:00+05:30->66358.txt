Gurgaon: Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, on a visit to Gurgaon on Saturday, inaugurated a boosting station in Sector 16 that is expected to solve the   woes faced by around 3.5 lakh people living in   between 30 and 40, Jalvayu Vihar, Jharsa and nearby areas. 

 It will also supply water to commercial areas, including   Cyber Hub.
 
 Constructed by Huda on 8 acres for an estimated Rs 82.40 crore, the new boosting station has an underground tank with a capacity of 6,500 kilolittre to ensure continuous supply even if flow from the water treatment plant is disrupted.
 
 Now, the city has three boosting stations, including the new one. The older stations are located in Sector 5 and 51, which receives water through the mater pipelines from Basai and   plants (WTP) and then distribute it to different sectors. 
 
 “Existing boosting stations were unable to cater to the needs of the entire city. Thus, many parts of the city have been facing regular water problems. But, now with the new station in place, every household in the city will get uninterrupted supply,” said a senior Huda official.
 
 In the day, the chief minister also inaugurated a media centre on the 5th floor of the mini secretariat.
