MOHALI: Air intelligence and   sleuths   210 gm of   valued at around Rs 6.3 lakh from a passenger who arrived at Chandigarh International   from Dubai on Friday. Sources in the customs department said the passenger was caught while he was trying to sneak out of the green channel.

 Sources said a passenger (name not disclosed) from Kolkata, who was travelling from Dubai to Chandigarh on an Indigo flight was walking past the green channel after picking up his baggage when customs officials noticed him because he was jittery. He said he was supposed to board a train to Kolkata from Chandigarh. 
 
 Customs sleuths stopped him and asked him if he had something to declare but the passenger denied it. Then he was asked to pass through an x-ray machine in which some solid material was detected around his neck. On searching, customs sleuths found a gold chain around his neck wrapped in a cloth and covered with the shirt he was wearing.
 
 When asked to produce relevant papers supporting the purchase of the gold, he failed to do so, sources said. Customs sleuths said the gold has been seized but as it was valued below Rs 20 lakh, the accused has been let off. They said the gold will be released if he produces any documentary evidence or pay fine.
