NEW DELHI: While the   students joined a protest march against the May 2016   on the call of the teachers, vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar appealed to the university community to “come forward and save the institution from detractors and agitators who appear hell-bent on making JNU dysfunctional,“ in a two page appeal released by the university administration on Tuesday.

 The VC cited how officials were not allowed to conduct their duties by a “small number of unruly students,“ claiming that instead of discussing the issue with the administration, they are resorting to unfair and unproductive tactics of demanding an interaction with him in a public space. He added that several top officials met the agitating students and requested them to discontinue the “undemocratic and illegal occupation of the administrative building,“ which the students refused.
 
 JNUTA president Ayesha Kidwai addressed over a thousand students who had joined the march said that the implementation of the notification would not only keep students out of universities but will also throw out those studying there. “The recent unilateral and authoritarian decisions taken by the administration have involved serious violations of the statutes, ordinances, rules and established processes of the university ,“ read a statement by JNUTA.
 
 The JNUTA also accused the VC for the “falsification of minutes by 34 members of the academic council“ and said that all discussions related to admissions should be held in the academic council, which they claim never happened.
