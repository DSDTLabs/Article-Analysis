PATNA: The teachers and non-teaching staff of   (PU) are also likely to feel the ‘new pinch’ from the current month itself following the commencement of their monthly salary payment through government treasury. The 100-year-old system of the university making direct payment of salaries to their staff has become a thing of the past now.

 Separate accounts of staff of all the universities have already been opened and the amount due to them would be credited in their accounts. The details of salaries, pension or other arrears of individual staff would be sent to the treasury by the respective universities. 
 
 PU registrar Rabindra Kumar said the salary advice of teachers and employees has not been sent to the bank for payment of salary for March following the government order. The details of salary of individual staff would be sent to the government for payment through treasury, he said.
 
 Expressing grave concern over the new system of salary payment, Patna University Teachers’ Association president Randhir Kumar Singh said now onwards even the PU teachers would face financial hardship due to delayed payment of their salaries. Up till now, the university used to disburse their salaries from its internal resources in anticipation of the receipt of the grants from the government. But, now they will have to wait for the release of the salary grants from the treasury (PL Account 307), he said.
 
 Singh apprehended that several teachers and employees of PU, who have taken loans from banks for housing or vehicles, may prove defaulters and have to pay penalty owing to non-payment of monthly instalments to the bank. 
 
 A similar move was made by the government in 2009-10, but it was dropped following the intervention of the Patna high court, said Singh. He urged the chancellor and the state government to allow PU to continue with its old system of making salary payment and save the university people from unnecessary harassment.
