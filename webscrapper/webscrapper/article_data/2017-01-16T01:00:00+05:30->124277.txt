Gurgaon Police recently held a special drive against drunken driving at  . The highlight of this particular drive was that ‘Yamraj’ was also accompanying the traffic cops on the road! No, not the actual god of death, but RSO (Road Safety Officer) Deepak Jaggi dressed as him.

 
 
  On the occasion of  , Gurgaon Police invited Yamraj to ask people to not drive drunk. When they stopped drivers to check their blood alcohol content, Yamraj would tell them, "Agar daaru pi hai toh mere saath chal, nahin toh ghar nikal!" or "Joh log nashe mein gaadi chalate hain, unhe main saath lekar jaunga!"

  The drive also saw quite a few bahanas and threats from Gurgaonwallahs. Instead of the usual ‘tu jaanta nahin mera baap kaun hai’, they went a step further, and said, "Tu jaanta nahin mera chacha, tau, mama... etc kaun hai." And calls were promptly made to the who’s who of Gurgaon, including judges and ministers. One man caught   called a judge, who then had a ‘conversation’ with the cops on duty, and the offender was allowed to go.

  The police also caught an aam aadmi, who knew nobody and made no excuses. When his driving license was seized for three months, he said, "Main kisi ko nahin janta jise phone kar ke bulaoon. Ab agle teen mahine tak mujhe bas cabs ka hi sahara hai." The cops told us that one of the most common excuses was, "I am not drunk. Do I look like a man who would drink and drive? My friends called me for a party and they forced me to drink. Main toh bilkul nahin peeta."
