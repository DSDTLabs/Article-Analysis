NAGPUR: Gosikhurd irrigation project, the biggest in Vidarbha, needs Rs 8,200 crore in two years if is to meet the March 2020 completion deadline set by   (VIDC). So far about Rs 10,300 crore has been spent on Rs 18,500 crore project.

 VIDC wants Rs 2,700 crore in 2018-19 and Rs 4,500 crore in 2019-20. Another Rs 1,000 crore is needed for pending works of 2017-18. However, Central and state governments had sanctioned only Rs 750 crore for 2018-19. Fortunately, corporation has Rs 650 crore unspent amount. Between 2013-14 and 2016-17, no Central funds were received.
 
 Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had announced in November 2017 that a loan of Rs 6,000 crore would be taken from World Bank for completing the project. This seems to be the only solution but neither the Central government nor the state has acted on this suggestion.
 
 Lack of funds has hit the project badly. For example very little work has been done on 55 km long   branch canal. VIDC officers are clueless as to when they will receive the funds. A VIDC official said, “The irrigation potential of the project is 2.5 lakh hectares. By the end of June 2016, we had achieved about 49,500 hectares. Another 13,000 hectares was added in 2016-17. Thus the total irrigation achieved is around 62,500 hectare. The remaining 1.88 lakh hectare has been split year wise. Some 42,000 hectares was to be created by March 2018, another 67,500 hectares in 2018-19 and 79,000 in 2019-20.”
 
 On relocation of project affected families, the official said the total number was about 15,000, of which 10,800 had already been shifted. Some 1,900 families remain in Nagpur district while 2,300 remain to be rehabilitated in Bhandara. “Of the 85 affected villages, 41 have been completely shifted. All village in Phase-I have been shifted, 23 remain in Phase-II and 21 in Phase-III,” he added.
 
 Reeling out land acquisition figures, he said, “We want 39,500 hectares of which 35,300 hectares have been acquired and only 4,200 hectares remains.”
 
 The project had suffered a big setback when the incumbent state government cancelled 80 tenders of the project as they had come under the cloud of Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB).
