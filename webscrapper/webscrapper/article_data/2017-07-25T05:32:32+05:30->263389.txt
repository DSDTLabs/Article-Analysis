BHOPAL: Another   complaint surfaced at   on Monday in the middle of a probe into two earlier complaints on the   helpline in which freshers alleged that they were made to watch porn and sexually harassed.

 This time, some juniors allege they were forced to simulate sex with trees and plants on campus and seniors laughed and jeered.
 
 In the latest complaint, a fresher says: “Every day, I face ragging. Juniors were forced to assemble and told to chant in a way that we abused ourselves. We were told to act and dance on vulgar songs and imitate porn actors. We were also told to simulate sex with trees and plants.”
 
 Narrating his horrifying experience, the complainant said, “We were in the middle of the campus and told to ‘sell our bodies to other people’. All this was happening while seniors laughed at us and enjoyed.”
 
 A lot of students cried but they were forced to do it, he says. “At night seniors call us to their rooms and make us dance to obscene songs. Even when we complained to the college authorities they turned a blind eye.” Several senior students have been named in the complaint.
 
 TOI contacted the NLIU director and registrar but their phones were switched off. A message had not been answered at the time of filing this report.
 
 Earlier, back-to-back complaints were filed on July 18 and July 20 where freshers accused some seniors of torturing them regularly. “Ragging in NLIU is very bad. I come from a very orthodox and humble background where we don’t abuse, but here every senior uses foul language to us,” wrote a student in the complaint.
 
 “A senior forced me to watch porn again and again till 5am. He abuses me as if I don’t have any respect. Please help me. Seniors here are not letting us to study. This is getting out of control,” another complaint said.
