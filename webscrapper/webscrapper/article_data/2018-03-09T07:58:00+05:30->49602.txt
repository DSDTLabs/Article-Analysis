Ludhiana: Two city-based   — Aman (18) and Kavita Dhadial (19) — have made Ludhiana proud on the occasion of International Women’s Day by securing gold medals in the Punjab Open State Judo Youth and Junior Championship matches, held in Jalandhar (Government Senior Secondary School) from March 3 to 4.

 Apart from winning medals, both have been selected for the National Level Judo Championship matches, which will be played in Jalandhar (PAP Sports Ground) from March 27 to 30. Even though there are seven more city-based girl judokas who showcased the best of their performances, making the district proud in the state meet, they failed to secure a berth in the national squad for further matches. The best performers who holds medals are Anjali Sharma (third place in 40kg), Karan Dehraj (third place in 44kg), Prabhsimran (third in 57kg), Shubhneen (third in 63kg), Bavleen (second in 63kg), Simranjeet Kaur (second in 70kg), and Majot Kaur (second in open weight category).
 
 Aman had this to say about her ambition in the sports arena: “Kavita and I were selected for national level tournament matches, where we have to fight with all prominent sports personalities of countries (related to judo games) to qualify for the Asian Championship trials which fall in the middle of April. We have secured gold medals for the second consecutive time in the state meet, but this time, it will come on the occasion of International Women’s Day, so it’s a little more special for us.”
 
 Kavita added: “The message we would like to convey to society through our achievement is that families of girls who still think judo is not a sport for girls should change their mindset, as modern girls do better than boys in many sports events. We both are a perfect example of that.”
 
 Coach Parveen Thakur said: “The level of confidence which both have built up on their own is extra-ordinary, and we are sure one day they will make the nation proud in the Asian and Commonwealth Games, due to their hard work and dedication.”
