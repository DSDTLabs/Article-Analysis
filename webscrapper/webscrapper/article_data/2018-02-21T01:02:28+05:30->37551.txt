Tirunelveli: Police officers from more than 80 police stations in Tirunelveli city and Tirunelveli district took part in the one-day capacity building programme for child welfare police officers, organised recently in the city. The programme was jointly organised by the department of social defence, integrated child protection scheme and the district child protection unit.

 District child protection officer B S Dev Anand said that officers were elaborated on the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. “There are instances of boys involved in a scuffle, when a case is registered against them and the boys are detained by the police. They boys are then lodged in the home for children in conflict with the law,” he said.
 
 The officer said that this is not in the best interest of the child as there are children who are even involved in grave offences who are lodged in the home for children in conflict with the law. “This will psychologically affect children who were involved in minor scuffles. So we elaborated the right way of handling them with the help of experts. It was an eye-opener for many,” he added.
 
 The role of the juvenile justice board, child welfare committee and district child protection unit in rescuing and handling children in conflict with the law or victims of abuse and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act was also elaborated in the deliberations. Superintendent of Police of Tirunelveli district P Ve Arunsakthikumar presided over the programme.
