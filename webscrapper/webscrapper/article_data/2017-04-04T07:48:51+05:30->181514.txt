NAGPUR: “Marathi has been a multi-lingual language since its inception, so it will never be vanished. Languages which are monolingual have a history of fading away with time,” said  , a linguistic researcher, on Monday.

 He was speaking at Dr VB Upakhya Bhausaheb Kolte lecture series on the topic ‘Maharashtrachi Bahubhashikta’ organized by   (NU) at Gramgeeta Bhavan, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Shaikshanik Parisar.
 
 “Maharashtra has always been a land of various languages. Currently, there are 52 spoken languages. The multilingual dialogue started in   with Sant Dhyaneshwar as he used   and Sanskrit languages in his poems,” Devy said.
 
 Emphasizing on the multi-language culture of India, Devy said, “In the 1961 census, the government registered 1,652 mother tongues in the country. But due to some technical issues, they kept only 109 languages as mother tongues. When we did a survey in 2010, 850 languages were still in use. It shows the multi-language culture of Indians.”
 
 Talking about the fall of many dynasties due to their monolingual culture, the language researcher said, “The Roman Empire fell because of its monolingual culture. It refused to accept Latin and other languages on the boarders of its territory. The British were never multilingual. They used the process of translation to communicate with people. If they were multilingual, they would have taken stories or songs from India to Britain.”
 
 “Even in 1616 when Jahangir gave permission to the British for trade, they took help of Armenian people for translation,” he said.
 
 The researcher said that Marathi is not only a literature-based language, it is a culture of music, drama and worship. “There is a small section of ‘Gondhali’ community in Maharashtra which uses sign language for communication. They can communicate with the people of any language. Even   used this community in warfare for transmitting messages,” Devy added.
