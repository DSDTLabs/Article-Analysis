Mumbai: The Centre on Friday told the Bombay HC it has increased   for terror attack victims and their kin from Rs 3 to Rs 5 lakh. A bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice Girish Kulkarni were informed by the Centre’s advocate, Rajshekhar Govilkar, that the revised guidelines shows the enhancement of compensation. 

 In May 2013, the HC had directed the central and state governments to frame a policy to enhance compensation, noting that the existing compensation was “inadequate”. Last month, the state told the court that it has increased the compensation from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. The bench said the Centre and state’s revised compensation schemes have taken protective measures by making payments through cheques and keeping the money in fixed deposits. 
 
 “If any individual applicant is not given benefit of the scheme given by the state or the Centre, they are at liberty to approach the court,’’ the HC said. —Rosy Sequiera
