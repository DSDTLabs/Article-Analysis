CHENNAI: An   kiosk caught fire near   in   on Monday evening, sparking panic among customers and residents of the area.

 The fire, which is said to have been triggered by a short cicuit in a battery of the ATM in the kiosk of an Indian Bank branch, was doused by firemen after a 30-minute battle, police said. By then, the air conditioner, UPS and computer systems were burned down. No one was injured in the incident.
 
 Around 5.15pm, a customer was withdrawing cash when he noticed a spark from the ATM and shouted out a warning. The others who were standing behind him in the kiosk, which had two rooms storing machines, immediately ran out.
 
 “We brought out the customer who was trapped inside one of the rooms before the fire spread,” said Anand, who was in the queue.
 
 The alarm went off and the fire spread. A huge crowd gathered outside the booth. Someone alerted police and fire and rescue services personnel. Before they could arrive, several residents of the area tried using the fire extinguishers provided inside the kiosk but did not succeed in dousing the blaze. Others tried sprinkling water to put out the fire but failed.
 
 Teams of fire and rescue services personnel from the Guindy and Saidapet fire stations reached the spot with two fire tenders. They doused the blaze after fighting for more than half an hour. The manager of the Indian Bank branch also reached the scene along with senior officials. The money inside the ATM was safely recovered, officials said. Police said the cash amounted to nearly Rs 3 lakh.
 
 According to fire and rescue services officials, the fire engulfed the machine after a short circuit in the electric wire connected to the battery.
 
 A case has been filed and an investigation has been ordered to look into the fire incident.
