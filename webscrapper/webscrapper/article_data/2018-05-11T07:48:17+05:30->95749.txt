 "Typical Delhi track. Looks a really good surface. Not a lot of grass, certainly a lot of bare patches. The average score here batting first has been about the 180-run mark. It's been a bit lesser this season although some big scores have been chased down. Sides batting first have won the last six games and it shall be interesting to see if the chasing team can buck the trend." -
