The order of NGT, copy of which is with TOI reads, "We appoint AR Takkar as a local commissioner who shall visit the plant at Chandigarh and submit the report in relation to the landfill site as well as the working of the garbage processing plant, which will be recorded in the report as to what municipal solid waste is being accepted by the plant everyday, reasons for not accepting because of those claims by the corporation that they have 400 MT of waste but only 80 to 100 MT is accepted by the operator, besides waste from Shimla is not accepted."
 
 The statement further states, "We direct the local commissioner a fee of Rs 40,000 to be paid by Shimla and   in equal shares besides expense. It is made clear that this direction is subject to final orders of the tribunal even in regard to payment of fees." When asked a senior MC official said, "Now the independent commissioner will verify the claims and allegations of both of the parties and will submit the report."
 
 Significantly, from Day 1, MC has been accusing garbage processing plant operators of lackadaisical approach, while on the other hand, JP claims it has not been getting proper garbage that can be processed as per norms. The next date of hearing has been fixed on May 22.
