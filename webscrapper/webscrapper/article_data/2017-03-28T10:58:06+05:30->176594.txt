GUWAHATI: Demanding equality in every sphere of life, a transgender from   has moved the Gauhati high court seeking its intervention in asking the state government to take necessary steps to secure the rights and welfare of the transgender community. The state has a transgender population of over 20,000. 

 Swati Bidhan Baruah, the petitioner, said, "When the government vows 'sab ka saath, sab ka vikaas,' why are the transgender people not under the purview of this promise? The transgender people don't find any job opportunities, face problems while getting admissions in educational institutions and police don't even register complaints by transgender people. This is discrimination against an entire section of the society."
 
 In response to the   (PIL) by Baruah, the Gauhati high court has issued notices to both Centre and state government to file their respective replies before the court within four weeks.
 
 Bishesh Huirem, a transgender actor from  , who represented India at the Miss International   contest held in   last year, said, "Despite the whole world having recognized the rights of transgender people, our society is yet to accept us."
