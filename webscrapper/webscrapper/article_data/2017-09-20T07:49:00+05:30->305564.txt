Sangrur: Two policemen, including the Longowal SHO, and four farmers were injured in a clash between farmers and the police in Longowal village on Tuesday evening.

 The incident took place after the police reached Badialan Patti area of the Longowal village to detain Gurmel Singh, the farmer leader of BKU (Ugrahan). The family members of the leader raised objection after the police started looking for him in the house at around 6.30 pm.
 
 Soon after, other farmers in the village gathered and raised voices in support of the family. Following this, the police allegedly cane charged them. In retaliation, farmers started pelting stones on and assaulted the policemen, allegedly with wooden sticks. The villagers allegedly also partially damaged the police vehicle.
 
 Later, SHO Vijay Kumar and munshi Hardev Singh were admitted to the Sangrur civil hospital with injuries to his head. While an injured farmer Manpreet Singh was admitted to the same hospital, two injured women, Ranjit Kaur and Surjit Kaur were admitted to a private hospital.
 
 The farmers alleged that police used force and assaulted women inside Gurmel’s house.
 
 Samana DSP Williams Jay Jee said, “We are registering a case against the accused for attempt to murder and under others sections. Our two cops have been seriously injured. There are around 10 to 15 people who will be booked. Police were inside the village and near the house of Gurmel Singh. But Gurmel’s family and other villagers got afraid and attacked the police as they wanted to teach lesson to police for detaining the farmers.”
 
  Meanwhile, BKU Ugrahan Sangrur vice president Jaswinder Singh Soma condemned police action and said, “Farmers have been assaulted by the police without any fault. The government is not only suppressing the voice of democracy by detaining farmers before the September 22 protest, but also assaulting farmers and their families. The act is not justified and we demand that the accused cops should be booked.”
