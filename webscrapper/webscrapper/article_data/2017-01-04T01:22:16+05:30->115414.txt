NEW DELHI: A new vegetable and fruit wholesale market is expected to come up near the Delhi border at Tikri Khanpur which will be spread over 70 acres. The Rs 800-crore project is expected to take the load off Azadpur   as movement of trucks within the city will be limited.

 All existing mandis will also be upgraded to e-mandis. Development minister Gopal Rai said that the mandi at Tikri Khanpur would come up within 25 years. “We have decided to modernise trade and business within the capital. For that, Delhi government will facilitate technological makeover of existing mandis into e-mandis. This was decided during a review meeting with Delhi Agricultural Marketing Board where the budget for 2017-2018 was passed,” he said.
 
 The estimated income for the next financial year is Rs 371.18 crore, while the proposed expenditure is Rs 434.19 crore.
 
 Rai announced that the Azadpur cement warehouse area will also witness changes at a cost of Rs 20 crore.
