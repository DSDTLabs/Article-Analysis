Scientists have developed an ‘injectable bandage’ — a therapeu
 tic gel that can heal potentially fatal internal injuries.

 A penetrating injury from shrapnel is a serious obstacle in overcoming battlefield wounds that can ultimately lead to death. Given the high mortality rates due to haemorrhaging, there is an unmet need to quickly self-administer materials that prevent fatality due to excessive blood loss.
 
 With a gelling agent commonly used in preparing pastries, researchers from the Texas A&M University in the US have successfully fabricated an injectable bandage to stop bleeding and promote wound healing.
 
 Researchers used kappa-carrageenan and nanosilicates to form injectable   to promote   (the process to stop bleeding) and facilitate wound healing via a controlled release of therapeutics.
 
 “Injectable hydrogels are promising materials for achieving hemostasis in case of internal injuries and bleeding, as these biomaterials can be introduced into a wound site using minimally invasive approaches,” said  , assistant professor at Texas A&M University. The study, published in the journal  , uses a common thickening agent known as kappa-carrageenan, obtained from seaweed, to design injectable hydrogels.
