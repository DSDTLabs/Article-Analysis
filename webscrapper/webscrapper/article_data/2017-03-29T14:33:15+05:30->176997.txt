NAGPUR: The proposed amendments by   in the Advocates Act seem to have not gone down well with the lawyers’ fraternity with the   and Goa deciding to go on the strike on March 31. However, their stand was staunchly opposed by the advocate general (AG) Rohit Deo, who tendered resignation as the Bar Council chairman with immediate effect, lawyers informed.

 The AG called the strike as “untenable” and in “contempt of the court” as no meeting of   was called on for deciding it. Though Deo’s mobile was switched of, lawyers from the Bar Council confirmed the development.
 
 Terming the new amendments as “draconian”, former vice-chairman of council, Anil Gowardipe, said it was unanimous decision to observe the one-day stir. “All lawyers from the high courts, district and session courts, and others establishments, would be go on mass strike on March 31to oppose the government’s move to make amendments in the Act.”
 
 He objected on the move to bar lawyers from  , if their practice was below ten years. “In executive body of Bar Council, they proposed 21 members where five would be government’s nominees while 15 would be elected ones. These are completely anti-lawyer, unconstitutional, and undemocratic, we   them,” he said.
 
 He, however, clarified that he had no idea about whether Deo had tendered his resignation or not. “The norms leading to legal profession, including disciplinary proceedings, would be looked after by the persons having no knowledge of legal profession. The Law Commission’s recommendations are completely against the legal profession. The entire fraternity faces threat due to proposed amendments and this wouldn't be tolerated” Gowardipe added.
