KOTA: A team of   ( ) and Child Line jointly rescued seven child labourers from railway station in Kota late on Monday evening. They were spotted by   (RPF) personnel. The children were later sent to Tabar shelter home in Kota. 

 "At least seven child labourers were yesterday evening spotted by RPF personnel at Kota railway station where they were looking for the train to Indore in MP," said CWC chairman Harish Gurbakshani. 
 
 RPF informed CWC and Child Line about the child labourers following which a joint team rushed to the spot and rescued the children, he added.
 
 The seven child labourers, all boys, are from Bulandshahar city in MP.
 
 Preliminary inquiry revealed that they were sent to Kota for work by a contractor in Indore on February 2, the CWC chairman said.
 
 The boys were beaten up and thrashed by their employer in Kota and were not given food and payment. Last evening, they managed to escape from   where they were engaged in catering work and rushed to Kota railway station to board a train to Indore, he added.
 
 The boys do not know anything about the employer in Kota so an investigation to ascertain his identity is underway. However, CWC directed Bhimganj Mandi police to lodge a case against the contractor from Indore.
