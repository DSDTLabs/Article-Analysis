NEW DELHI: Fugitive televangelist   could soon become a stateless person, with the Regional Passport Office, Mumbai, serving him a 10-day ultimatum to submit his passport in person or face its revocation. 

 The proceedings were initiated on a request from the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing Naik’s speeches that allegedly incited youth to commit terror acts, after he failed to respond to its multiple notices asking him to join the investigation. The assistant passport officer (policy) at RPO Mumbai wrote to Naik on July 3, directing that he meet him on any working day between 10 am and 12.30 pm within 10 days from the issue of the letter, along with his passport dated January 20, 2016. “Failure to submit the passport will force us to initiate necessary action under the Passport Act, 1967 against you,” he warned. 
 
 The NIA had written to the RPO, Mumbai, on June 29 seeking revocation of Naik’s passport on the ground that he was “not cooperating with them in the investigation pending against him”. Citing its June 23 communication to the home ministry, the NIA said Zakir Naik had thrice been issued notices under Section 160 of CrPC on February 28, March 15 and March 31 but was yet to join the proceedings against him. It added that a non-bailable warrant had been issued against him on April 21. 
 
 Naik had left India on May 13 last year and has not come back. NIA sources said he has been travelling to different countries, Malaysia being his last known location.
