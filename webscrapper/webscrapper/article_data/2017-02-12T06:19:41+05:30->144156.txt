MUNGER: Police patrolling has been intensified in   town following the murder of local traders   and Md Raza near village   at around 8pm on Friday. 

 People on Saturday blocked the three entry points to Jamui town, including Mahsauri Chowk, Khaira Mor and Thana Chowk, for at least four hours causing traffic jam. “The protesters were demanding immediate arrest of the killers and adequate compensation to the bereaved families,” police sources said and added, “The blockade was lifted only after the SP’s assurance to the agitators.”
 
 Police said when both Khurshid and Raza were at a confectionery shop near DAV School Mor at Maniyadda village, two bikers came and shot them dead. The victims had gone to Maniyadda to meet someone, sources said. The police were not able to identify the caller as the cellphones of both Khurshid and Raza were missing.
 
 Jamui SP Jayant Kant said one person has been detained. “Raids are being conducted on the suspected hideouts on the information provided by the person in police custody,” the SP said.
 
 He said Khurshid was engaged in egg trade while Raza dealt in mobile phones.
 
 Police sources said tension gripped the town after the news of the murder reached Jamui bazar. All shops and business establishments downed their shutters. Members of the deceased families and relatives started gathering at the sadar hospital. 
 
 The SP also rushed there and deployed over 200 policemen on the hospital premises as people were expressing their anger against the cops. Police had to use mild force to control the situation at the hospital after the two bodies were brought there.
