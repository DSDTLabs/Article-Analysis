However, delay in developmental works has led to many problems like poor repairs of pits dug up for soil testing as people face difficulty while commuting. Pits on Residency Road approach road to Chhaoni is an example of the works done half-heartedly as these are yet to be filled by the authorities, the VTA delegation pointed out.

 VTA thanked the NHAI for initiating pending work on Hyderabad-Jabalpur highway and other developmental works that would change the face of the city.
