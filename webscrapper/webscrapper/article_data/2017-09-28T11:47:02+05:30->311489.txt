KANNUR: Preparations are in full swing for the  , led by BJP State president Kummanam Rajashekharan, which would be flagged off by party national president   at   in the district on October 3. The yathra, which was earlier scheduled for September 7, was rescheduled following the inconvenience of the national leaders of the party.

 According to the review meeting held in Payyannur on Wednesday, the preparations are in the final lap and the organisers expect this will bring about a major change in the political landscape of Kerala.
 
 The leaders, who reviewed the preparations, also said Amit Shah will walk eight kilometers up to   as part of the yathra. Later, on the third day, also he will be part of it and walk a portion of the stretch between   and Thalassery. The march will conclude in Thiruvanathapuram on October 17, in which also Shah will attend.
 
 Though the BJP wants to strengthen its ground in the State ahead of the elections, its main target is the CPM. Though such marches are normally flagged off from Kasaragod, the decision to flag off from Kannur district itself is a deliberate one, which is part of the campaign to portray Kannur as the hub of what the BJP calls ‘red terror’. Also, in the wake of the ISIS recruitment related issues from the district, they can use the same yathra against the so-called ‘jihad terror’ as well. The party has even organised photo exhibition at Kannur, portraying   violence, as part of the yathra.
 
 But this yathra is a bid to present a wrong picture, said CPM State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who added that it should have been organised in the BJP-ruled States that have recorded higher rates of murders.
