THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Around 34,000 students in government and aided schools in the state don’t have   to establish their individual credentials, according to the latest figures available with the general  .

 As per government records, there are around 33 lakh students in government and aided schools in the state. 
 
 The latest ID figures mean that the schools have either not entered the details of around 34,000 students in the government data base, or the actual number of students in schools is less than 34 the official figure.
 
 Following the detection of widespread student number mismatch in aided schools, the state government had earlier initiated strict action against several managements for presenting bogus details. There were even instances of schools uploading UIDs of grown-up people. This was done, it is alleged, to create or retain teaching posts.
 
 According to a Director of Public Instructions (DPI) circular in January, there was no UID/EID details of around one lakh students in the government/aided schools in the state. The DPI had set January 31 as the deadline for the schools to provide the details on an online facility run by the IT@School.
 
 The mismatch is expected to affect planning for the education sector. There were even instances of certain unaided school managements uploading the details of other aided school students.
 
 “We don’t think the around 34,000 students now missing in the data base are bogus. There was a time when schools used to furnish bogus details but the constant checking introduced by the government has eliminated this. We believe that it was laxity on the part of parents in availing UID registration for their wards that lead to the mismatch,” said DPI, K V Mohankumar. He said that it will be ensured all students in government and aided schools have UID or EID details by the next academic year.
