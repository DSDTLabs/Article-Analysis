COIMBATORE: A ‘mentally disturbed’ man, who killed his 29-year-old sister, chopped the body into pieces and set it on fire in front of his eight-year-old niece, was nabbed on Saturday.

 Twenty-seven-year-old  , a resident of   near  , had murdered his sister   over a domestic dispute, police sources said. “Sangeetha was staying with her mother and brother in a rented house in Uppilipalayam after separating from her husband a few months ago. She has an eight-year-old daughter. She was working as a receptionist in a private hospital near  ,” a police officer said.
 
 Preliminary investigation revealed that Saravanakumar was under treatment for mental illness for the last two years. “As Saravanakumar used to create nuisance in the neighbourhood, the house owners had asked Sangeetha to vacate the house. Sangeetha had a quarrel with him over the issue after their mother, who is working as a nurse in another private hospital at Peelamedu, left for work on Saturday morning. In a fit of rage, the man hacked her using a sickle in front of her daughter. He chopped the body into pieces and packed it in a suitcase. He carried the suitcase to   on a motorcycle along with the deceased’s daughter and set it on fire after pouring petrol over it. He then returned home along with the minor girl,” the officer told TOI.
