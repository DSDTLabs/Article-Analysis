MUMBAI: Regular drives by the  ,   towards offenders and introduction of   are some of the reasons that have helped bring down   in the city for the   in 2016.

 A Mumbai traffic police report for last year shows there were 17,29,322 offences recorded in 2016 against 18,55,111 in 2015 -an overall drop of 6.8%.But cases of drunk driving saw a rise (16.4% over 2015), and so did helmetless riding (24%), and driving without safety belt (12%). Experts pointed out the increasing figures might not be such a bad thing as it shows the cops are enforcing rules and thereby pre-empting a number of possibly fatal accidents.
 
 Some prominent offences that saw a dip in cases were rash driving (18.2%), speeding (48%), and jumping signal (6.2%).
 
 The state received over Rs 20 crore on an average every year for five years from fines imposed on rule violators.
 
 This could go up manifold in the coming year as the traffic police expect offences recorded to rise sharply -may be double, say some -thanks to the ongoing addition of hundreds of closed-circuit television cameras (CCTV), speed cameras, digital breathalysers and other hi-tech gadgets. A total of 2,68,339 traffic violations were reported from December 31, 2016, to January 16, 2017. In all of 2016, 17,29,322 traffic violations had been recorded.
 
 “The introduction of hitech gadgets will act as a deterrent with e-challans being sent to violators; and with the help of RTO, repeat offenders will face suspension of their motor driving licence,“ said Milind Bharambe, joint commissioner of police (traffic).
 
 The traffic police and the regional transport offices (RTOs) are working to turn their combined force on traffic rule violators. The RTOs will help track and fine offenders and maintain a history of violations committed anywhere in Maharashtra by a driver so that his her licence can be suspended after four offences.
 
 The traffic police have collected data of over 20 lakh motorists and daily, at least 5,000 motorists are being e-challaned.
 
 
 
 
 Two facts stand out from these statistics. One, the crackdown on traffic offences over the past few years has instilled more discipline and road sense among drivers.Cases of overspeeding and jumping signal are showing a steady decline 2014 onwards.Secondly, action against drunk drivers is up, which indicates the ability and willingness of the traffic police to take pre-emptive action to avert potential loss of lives. Such a strategy, if adopted by every state, could help the country shed its image as the accident capital of the world.
