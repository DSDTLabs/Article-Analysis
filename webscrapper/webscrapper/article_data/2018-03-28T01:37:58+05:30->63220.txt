GURUGRAM: There is a nasty welcome awaiting students of Government Senior Secondary School in   every day. There are pools of overflowing sewer   in front of the school and inside the campus, accompanied by mosquitoes and unbearable stench. Students from different centres come here to take their Class XII board  , but to do so, they have to wade through knee-deep water.

 According to school principal Geeta Arya, “The last two days have unleashed hell in this school. Sewer water is overflowing inside the school. It’s difficult for students to study or play, or for anyone to have lunch.” The principal went on to say that she had written to the MCG on numerous occasions, but without any response. “I had deployed two teachers to see if they can get this water cleaned, but they too failed. Now, exams are going on and I can’t force my teachers to check if some other department helps to clear out this water,” added Arya.
 
 Class XII students who came to take physical education paper on Tuesday, described how hard it was for them to reach the school. Mohit Saini, a student of RMS Senior Secondary School, Sector 15, said, “I fell in the puddle outside the school. My socks got drenched. This is not what examinees want to see when they reach the centre.”
 
  The risk of falling sick from mosquito bites also disturbed many students.
 
 Meanwhile, officials at MCG said they have checked the sewer line and expect the water to recede in a day. MCG executive engineer Vikas Malik said, “We have received a complaint from the school. This sewer line is quite old and sometimes there is a lot of problem in the Civil Lines area, but now it is being rectified. Due to a damage in sewer line, the water was overflowing. We are getting it rectified and the work will be done today. This was not an existing issue.”
