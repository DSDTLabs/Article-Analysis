A day after a woman wrote an anonymous blog post claiming of alleged sexual harassment by   (TVF) founder and CEO Arunabh Kumar; many women have shared their stories of alleged exploitation at the TVF. The post that stirred a storm online now has several other celebrities joining their voices. The post under the name Indian Fowler claims to be a former employee of TVF and has accused its founder-CEO   of molesting her. Though TVF has denied all allegations and is more focused on looking out for the anonymous victim, members from the fraternity seem to have a different opinion on the issue.
