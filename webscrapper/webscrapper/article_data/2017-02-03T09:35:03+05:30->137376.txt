HYDERABAD: Former   S Jaipal Reddy on Thursday found fault with the Central government for maintaining a stoic silence on the crucial   in the Union budget. He said the government did not announce any new trains or projects.

 Addressing media here, Jaipal Reddy said the Centre had lost Rs 1,50,000 crore due to demonetisation by its own admission. However, if the report of the   (CMIE) report is taken into account, the loss is as high as Rs 3,00,000 crore.
 
 He said the budget had nothing to offer to the common man, who has been suffering heavily due to demonetisation of high value currency on November 8 last year. “People are not happy with the budget. The Centre has failed the common man. During my tenure as the union minister the subsidy given on petroleum products was Rs 1,30,000 crore. The subsidy component has now come down by Rs 1,00,000 crore due to fall in prices in the international market. But the economy failed to pick up,” he said. He said the demonetisation impact will continue for two to five years.
