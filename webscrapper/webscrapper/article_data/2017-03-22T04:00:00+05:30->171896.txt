Chennai: The financial year 2016-17 will be the third year in a row when car market leader Maruti Suzuki will be clocking an 11% growth and the fifth year that it will beat the passenger vehicle industry’s growth curve. The company, which is targeting four launches in the new fiscal — has also seen its marketshare grow from 39.4% to 47.6% between FY12-13 to FY16-17.

 The company is looking to retain the momentum in FY17-18 as well, staying ahead of the industry growth curve, said top company officials. “In the last 2-3 years, we have attracted new categories of customers, those who were not considering us earlier. Our recent models like Baleno, Ciaz, Brezza Vitara and Ignis are doing well. The network, including Nexa, is growing. The Gujarat plant will improve availability of vehicles. Building on all these, 2017-18 will be an important year in our medium term goal of 2 million sales in 2020. Like in the past 4-5 years, we want to do better than the market this year as well,” said Knichi Ayukawa, MD & CEO Maruti Suzuki.
 
 According to sources, the company is expected to roll out the next-generation Swift and Dzire in the new year as well as an S Cross upgrade. Several other models will get nips and tucks along with new safety features which will become mandatory by October 2017 onwards.
 
 Maruti has seen its sales recover smartly from 0.3% growth in FY13-14 to hit 11% growth for the next 3 years. 
 
 Maruti’s sales have actually jumped 25% and its marketshare has gone up by more than 8% in the last five years (see table). The company clocked just over a million units in FY12-13 at 1051046 units which has hit 1315946 units by FY16-17 (upto February). Since 2014-15, the company has been adding over 100,000 units a year though analysts say it has to up the game to around an additional 180,000 units or more to be able to hit 2 million by 2020. As per its parent's guidance, Maruti has committed to 15 new models and facelifts in the five years upto 2020 of which 8 have already been launched at the rate of 2 or 3 models a fiscal including Ciaz & Alto K-10 in 2014-15, S cross, Baleno, Brezza in 2015-16 and Ignis and Baleno RS in FY 16-17.
 
 The company's marketshare gain has been the result of models that have moved away from its conventional segment of entry level small cars into segments that are higher up the value chain. It's new premium channel Nexa has clocked cumulative volume of 200,000 units and over 48% of these customers are additional car buyers, which means they are upgrading "either from competition or are staying within the Maruti Suzuki fold", said a company official. Over 69% of NEXA customers mature buyers who may already have a car in the family.
