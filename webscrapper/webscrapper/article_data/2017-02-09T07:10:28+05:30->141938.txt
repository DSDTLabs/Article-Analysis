VADODARA: A day after a group of senators demanded that   should organize a special requisition meeting to discuss inclusion of 38 names registered in the electoral list prepared for the donor’s category seats on behalf of VadFest, office-bearers of VadFest tried to clear the air over the disputed donation. 

 A group of senators have alleged that the university has accepted a “so-called” donation in the name of the Vadodara International Art and Culture Festival known as VadFest which was organised in 2015 against which names of 38 individuals have been registered as voters for the two seats of donor’s category of MSU’s senate body elections of which are scheduled on Thursday. 
 
 The senators have demanded the meet stating that as per their information “no such donation is received by the university in the form of kind” and hence the receipts issued to 38 individuals or trusts are “unlawful”.
 
 A VadFest office-bearer, who is also a senate member at the university, on Wednesday wrote a letter to   vice-chancellor professor   stating that he had taken personal interest to see that donors agree to support the fine arts by contributing Rs one lakh each and accordingly the suppliers payments were cleared directly by these donors. 
 
 “The only connection of these donors with VadFest is that some of them were part of the VadFest team,” he states in the letter, adding that the role of donors was merely clearing the bills of the suppliers and they were in no manner involved in any other way in the whole episode. 
 
 “VadFest has not given a single rupee from capital renovation and all funds are directly paid by the donors to the university supplier,” the letter states, adding that “it is necessary for the university to clarify this to its own senate and syndicate members so that the speculation on the nature of this genuine donation is settled permanently.”
