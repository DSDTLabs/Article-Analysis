NEW DELHI: Five teachers of Jawaharlal Nehru University were served notices on Thursday night informing them of a day’s   for participating in a strike and “not following the rules” by addressing students outside the administration block on Wednesday.

 Terming the move as another threat to subvert democratic process in the campus,   Teachers’ Association president Ajay Patnaik said that the varsity teachers don’t come under the ambit of   (CCS) rules being cited by the administration.
 
 The university administration, however, claimed that the central government rules are applied in cases where the university does not have its own rules. The notice issued by JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said: “Under the principle of ‘no work, no pay’, faculty members who had participated in the strike will not be given pay and allowances for the day.” 
 
 JNUTA had observed a daylong strike on January 17 against several notices served to faculty members for addressing a protest by students against the decisions taken at the council meetings.
