Vijayawada: In a significant observation, a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India report for the year 2018 found that though   government invested Rs 8,795 crore in various corporations and companies, it could only earn an interest of Rs 4 crore. The   report on state finances found that the average rate of return on investment was a negligible 0.05% in 2016- 17 and none of the 271 projects was completed in stipulated time. 

 The Andhra Pradesh government had invested Rs 8,975 crore in statutory corporations ( Rs 205 crore) rural banks (Rs 26. 96 crore), government companies (Rs 6,623 crore), joint stock companies and cooperatives (Rs 2,061 crore). 
 
 The report also said the details for meagre interest were not provide by the Andhra Pradesh government. 
 
 Another major concern was that none of the 271 projects in different sectors, slated to be completed by March 2017, have been completed till date. The total funds used on these projects were Rs 54,602 crore as on March 2017, but original costs of the projects were revised by another Rs 28,036 crore. Non completion of projects within stipulated time resulted in hike in cost. 
 
 The majority of incomplete works relate to irrigation sector. The reasons for the delay as explained by state government were land acquisition, court cases, sites not handed over by various departments, change in designs, and government ban on certain works.
