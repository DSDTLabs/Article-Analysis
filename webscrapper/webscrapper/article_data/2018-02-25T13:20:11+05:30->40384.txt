MADURAI: The seventeenth birthday celebrations of late chief minister J   turned out to be a low key affair in Madurai as all ministers were taking part in the function where Prime Minister   was attending as chief guest on Saturday.

 Party cadres put up garlanded portrait sof their deceased leader at junctions and party offices and distribute sweets as part of the celebrations. The popular songs of the late actor-turned-politician were played through loudspeakers in most of the birthday programmes.
 
  leaders Pudur Duraipandian, MLA A K Bose, former MLAs M Muthuramalingam, Sundarajan and others presided over the functions held in various parts of the city. Free dhoties were distributed and meals provided at the old-age homes in the city. However, party functionaries said that they planned to celebrate her birthday in a big way once the ministers returned from the Prime Minister’s public function. “On the day, Amma scooters will be given away to the beneficiaries,” said AIADMK cadres at the AIADMK office on   road. Floral tributes were paid to the late leader at functions held in the southern districts.
