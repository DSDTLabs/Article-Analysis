LUCKNOW: To counter BJP's bid to make inroads into the Dalit vote bank with weeklong celebrations on the   of   on April 14, the BSP led by   has got its socio-cultural off shoot BAMSEF (Buddha Ambedkari Missionary Social Education Foundaion) to organise a grand 'Mahasammellan' (convention) and a ' ' (procession) in Lucknow on the eve of the occasion. 

 The BAMSEF-sounding similar to the original BAMCEF (Backward and Minorities Confederation of Employee Federation), the organization founded by BSP founder Kanshiram in early 1970s-was engaged by BSP last year to organise 'Dhamma Yatra' for Buddhist monks during Ambedkar Jayanti.
 
 At the convention, to be organised in Dalit populated Dubagga locality of the city, a host of professionals and intellectuals will speak on issues related to Dalit oppression and the community's social backwardness. School children will later lead a procession as a tribute to Ambedkar and his wife Rama Bai, highlighting the 'Bahujan movement'.
 
 BAMSEF president S P Kureel told TOI, "The idea is to spread ideas of Babasaheb and the foundation has invited NEETI Ayog director   and director (ministry of finance) Sunder Lal Kureel, besides IPS officer B P Ashok, PCS officer, Shriram Saroj and I-T officer P R Kureel." He added that BAMCEF functionaries comprising government officers and professionals will discuss issues like socio-economic backwardness of Dalits and their skewed representation in mainstream. BSP chief Mayawati has been distancing herself from holding such events. 
 
 On the other hand, BJP has an elaborate plan for a weeklong celebration across the country, with a view towards consolidating Dalits.
