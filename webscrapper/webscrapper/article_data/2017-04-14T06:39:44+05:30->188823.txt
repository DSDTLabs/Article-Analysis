BENGALURU: The victory in   can be credited to energy minister D K Shivakumar, who is seen as a good strategist when it comes to getting a candidate elected from a constituency of which he is in charge. His first major win was in   constituency in 2004, when newcomer Tejaswini Gowda trounced former PM H D Deve Gowda.

 In 2013, he was in charge of Bengaluru Rural and partly Mandya Lok Sabha bypolls, when his brother   and actor Ramya won.
 
 The seats were vacated with former CM H D Kumaraswamy and N   getting elected to the assembly. In 2014,   was put in charge of Ballari assembly bypoll where he ensured the victory of N Y Gopalkrishna, after the seat was vacated by BJP MP B Sreeramulu.
 
 Party member Milind Dharmasen, who has been following Kumar's campaigns, said: “Once a constituency is given to him, he identifies people capable of delivering and assigns responsibilities.“
 
 Kumar told the media that he would have done much better in Gundlupet if he had gone to the constituency a month ahead of the bypoll.
