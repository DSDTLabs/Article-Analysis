HYDERABAD: Cardiac cases, especially among the younger population, is on the rise in the city say experts. According to them, about 20 per cent of patients, walking in with these symptoms, are below the age of 35.

 
 “This problem occurs all of a sudden and, in many cases, despite youngsters leading a fairly active life and with no history of lifestyle disorders. The reason then is either a congenital disorder that went unnoticed or certain habits such as heavy smoking, obesity etc,” said  , senior consultant cardiologist, MaxCure Hospitals.
 
 Doctors share how coronary artery disease (CAD) in India manifests almost a decade earlier, than in western countries while acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) is a common cause for sudden deaths among young individuals. “Altered lifestyle and higher levels of stress lead to early onset of CAD. Among youngsters, heart attack is exclusively seen among men. In women, the oestrogen and progesterone hormones act as a shield,” he added.
 
 Not surprising then, doctors say that at least 1,500 to 2,000 cardiac catheterisation procedures — used to diagnose and treat cardiovascular problems — are performed in Hyderabad per day. “Of the total number of patients I get every day, at least 30 are young individuals. This translates into 20 per cent of all cases,” said Dr  , senior consultant cardiologist at Century Hospital.
 
 What complicates matters is the fact that youngsters often miss out on reading early symptoms — such as a ‘mini-stroke’ (transient ischemic stroke). “It is a temporary blockage of blood to the brain. Unlike stroke, the blood clot usually dissolves in a few minutes and does not have any permanent disabilities. But ignoring these signs is a blunder as it may signal at a full blown stroke ahead,” said Dr Sai Sudhakar, chief cardiac transplant physician, Gleneagles Global Hospitals.
