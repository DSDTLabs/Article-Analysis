NEW DELHI: The 32nd Surajkund International Crafts Mela has begun in Haryana's Surajkund city. This year, the 16-day festival will be a 'child-friendly event'.

 According to the Haryana tourism department, Uttar Pradesh has been chosen as the theme state for the event in which at least 20 countries and all states of India would participate.
 
 State tourism minister Ram Bilas Sharma has said various child-friendly procedures would be adopted at the fair, including setting up children-friendly space, cr√®che for wards of officials and workers, breastfeeding booths, first aid booths, lost and found centres and stalls for children with special needs.
 
 Besides advocating rights of children through hoardings, child tracking system through RFID tagging would be implemented at the fair.
 
 Under this, families visiting the mela with children below 14 years would have to get the minors registered at a special desk set up by the police. Each minor would be provided with a RFID tag which would be helpful in tracing them in case they get lost, he said.
 
 The fair is being organised by the   Authority in collaboration with the Union ministries of tourism, textile, culture and external affairs, Haryana tourism department and Haryana tourism corporation.
