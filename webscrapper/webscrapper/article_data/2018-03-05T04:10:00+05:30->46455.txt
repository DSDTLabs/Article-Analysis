Vadodara: Mystery shrouds the disappearance of a young electronic shop owner from Padra after his car was found abandoned near the city on Saturday.

 The shop owner Bhaumik Patel’s car was found with blood stains on the seats near Ankodiya village. On March 2, Patel had gone to his house near Bright School in Bhayli after meeting his parents at their home in Bhayli village. He was last seen at a soda shop near his house on the same night. On Saturday morning when he did not come to his parents’ house as per the daily routine, his father Ashwin called him but his phone was switched off. Later, he went to his house but found it locked. He came to know through the building’s watchman that Patel had gone to have soda. The soda shop owner also confirmed to his father that he had come there. But he did not return home after that.
 
 On Saturday afternoon, Vadodara taluka police station contacted Ashwin and told him that his car has been found abandoned near Ankodiya. On checking the car, blood stains were found on the seat but Patel was nowhere seen. Police then took the car’s custody and recorded a detailed statement of Ashwin.
 
 “I don’t think my son had enmity with anyone but I have learnt that the police had called my son’s business partner for their statement,” Ashwin told TOI.
 
 After working at his father’s electronics shop in Bhayli, Patel had opened his own shop in Padra town a month ago in partnership. Ashwin had given him stock worth Rs six lakh. Ashwin also told the police that he knew the partner for long and in the past when he wanted Rs 25 lakh, had even lent him money. Police said that they have formed different teams to find Patel.
 
 “We are checking his call detail records and are also trying to find out whom Patel used to meet regularly. Statements of his friends will also be taken if needed,” said a police official.
