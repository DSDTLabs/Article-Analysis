Ludhiana: A local court remanded a man to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for raping his live-in partner’s minor daughter. The court of additional sessions judge Dilbagh Singh Johal also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on the convict, failing which he will undergo additional eight months of rigorous imprisonment. 

 On November 4, 2013, police booked the 39-year-old accused under sections 377 (unnatural offences), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act on allegations that he had sexually abused a minor and threatened her with death.
 
 According to the prosecution, on November 4, 2013, assistant sub-inspector Jasbir Singh, investigating officer of the case and a few other police officials were on a patrol when the victim’s mother met him and narrated her ordeal. 
 
 She said she has three daughters and a son. However, she said, after 12 years of marriage, her husband turned alcoholic and started using money meant for the household to buy liquor. She said that left her with no option but to walk out.
 
 The complainant said she met the accused through a friend and got close to him. She said she has been living with him for the past eight to nine years and had two children. But around two and a half months ago, her mother died and she went to her village in Bihar, leaving the survivor behind. 
 
 When she returned, she said her daughter told her that the accused had unnatural sex with her under the influence of liquor and threatened her when she raised an alarm. 
 
 The defence counsel contended there is no medical evidence to support the allegations, so it was not in the interest of justice to convict the person only on the basis of oral evidence. However, the court on the basis of the evidence on record found the accused guilty.
