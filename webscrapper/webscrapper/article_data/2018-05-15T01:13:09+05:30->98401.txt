NEW DELHI: The government on Monday stopped short of sacking   MD & CEO   and   executive directors Sanjiv Saran and KV Brahmaji Rao after they were named in the chargesheet related to the $2 billion   case and ordered its nominees on the boards of the two state-run lenders to ensure they were divested of powers.

 
 Within hours, the   board complied with the instructions while Ananthasubramanian's fate may be decided as early as Tuesday. Saran and Rao skipped the board meeting where their fate was decided. But the decision was conveyed to them in PNB MD Sunil Mehta's room, where government nominee and additional secretary Ravi Mittal was present.
 
 Earlier on Monday, financial services secretary Rajiv Kumar convened a press conference to announce the decision, hours after they were named in the chargesheet filed by the CBI.
 
 Ananthasubramanian, who was abruptly moved out of PNB months before the fraud came to light, had also served as the bank's executive director. She headed PNB from 2015 to 2017 and was recently questioned by the probe agency. Incidentally, Allahabad Bank had one of the largest exposures to the letters of comfort, a sort of bank guarantees, which were fraudulently issued by PNB. "We have issued a formal letter to our directors in the board, and since this is in the domain of the board to decide, the boards will take an appropriate decision," Kumar told reporters.
 
 The finance ministry's directive to government nominees is seen as a move to prod the three senior bankers to put in their papers as their continuation without any work will create pressure on them. The move to divest the bankers of their powers was initiated as the process to remove them was going to take time. Kumar said the action followed an initial assessment, which had found lapses, and an explanation was sought 10 days ago. But the move has not gone down well in the bank, with executives saying they are yet to receive acopy of the chargesheet.
