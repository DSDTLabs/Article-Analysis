Mumbai: Targeting its ally the Shiv Sena, which controls the  , BJP legislator Ashish Shelar demanded a a special investigation team (SIT) be constituted to probe the development plan for the Byculla zoo in the House on Friday.

 “The project has faced a massive cost escalation with the consultant estimating costs of Rs 450 crore. Now the BMC commissioner has said it can be done for Rs 40 crore. There should be an SIT probe,” said Shelar. 
 
 He also raised questions about the manner in which penguins had been procured for the zoo. Shiv Sena’s Sunil Prabhu hit back by saying that if the government wanted an inquiry in the zoo redevelopment, then it should also be willing to constitute a SIT on the BMC chief as the elected representatives only approved his proposal. tnn
