  Boman Irani as 'Virus' in '3 Idiots'
 
 As Javadekar addressed the students, he said, "I think teachers should be like Viru Sahastrabuddhe, Boman Irani's character from '3 Idiots'. In the movie, when Aamir Khan as   asks his professor (Boman Irani) that if pens don't work in outer space, why didn't the astronauts use a pencil. And as Boman's character in the movie replies, 'I will get back to you'. I think our professors should be able to accept that they cannot know everything. And if a student asks them something that they do not know, then they should be able to say that they will get back to them. They should not search for that on Google and give the answer. They can do their research for two-three months and can get back."
