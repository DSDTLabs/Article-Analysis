NEW DELHI: At least three   patients who were allegedly administered contaminated injection at east Delhi’s Guru Tegh Bahadur ( ) Hospital are yet to be released, while another died recently due to heart attack.

 The Delhi government has sought a detailed report from the hospital and even   (NHRC) has sent a notice, said sources. “GTB has been asked to fix culpability. Those responsible will not be spared,” said a senior official at the health department. GTB medical director Dr Sunil Kumar said an inquiry had been ordered and the report would be submitted on Monday.
 
 Twenty-two patients suffering from various eye ailments were administered avastin, a sight-saving drug, on April 1. Next day, they complained about mild pain, watery eyes and blurred vision. Specialists were called immediately and serious cases were referred to  . Eight patients had to undergo vitrectomy within 24 hours to check the spread of infection. “One patient is still admitted here because we need cardiac clearance before conducting the procedure on her. She is stable,” said Dr Atul Kumar, who heads RP Eye Centre at AIIMS.
 
 Of the two patients admitted at GTB Hospital, one has eye infection while the other one is doing well, Dr Kumar added. “All other patients are doing fine and have been sent home.”
 
 However, a few patients who have already gone home are still complaining about blurred vision and other problems. “My brother-in-law, Shahnwaz (43), underwent surgery at AIIMS after he was administered the contaminated injection. But he can’t still see properly in the right eye,” said Afaq Ahmed, a resident of Yamuna Vihar. Rabiya, a relative of another patient, also complained about vision impairment even after the surgery.
