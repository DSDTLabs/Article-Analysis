PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Friday said RJD cannot conceal charges of corruption against party chief Lalu Prasad and other members of his family in the ‘land-for-railway hotels’ deal by raising slogans and creating ruckus in the state legislature.

 “If they (RJD legislators) feel that Lalu is being falsely implicated in the case, they should move court,” Modi said, adding instead of causing disruptions in the assembly, leader of opposition   should tell people as to how he became owner of the controversial land on which a Rs 750-crore mall was being constructed. 
 
 Tejashwi, the younger son of Lalu, is also a named accused in the regular case (RC) lodged by   in the land-for-hotels deal. “Tejashwi should also explain as to why Kochar brothers, who were leased out two hotels of the Indian Railways in Ranchi and Puri, transferred their land in the name of a company owned by family members of the then Union minister  ,” Modi said.
 
 He added, “Tejashwi should explain as to why Delight Marketing Private Company, owned by Gupta, later handed over the very plot of land to the members of Lalu family. Had Tejashwi answered these questions, he would not have lost the chair of deputy CM.”
