NEW DELHI: After cancelling the licence of  , the ministry of home affairs now wants to punish officials indicted by the K K Pathak committee in its report for various irregularities related to licence fee in  . The ministry has written to   seeking its green signal to start disciplinary proceedings. "The MHA is awaiting CVC nod, which is a pre-requisite before the ministry can issue a chargesheet against officers and take action. We hope the CVC clearance comes soon," a source said. 

  TOI has learnt that at least five "irregularities" pointed out by the Pathak report have been taken seriously by the ministry to warrant internal action, beyond the   probe that MHA separately recommended, leading to a preliminary enquiry. These irregularities include violation of recruitment rules in appointing Himanshu Ranjan as deputy director in NDMC, calculation of licence fee with respect to   Hotel, regularising of a flower kiosk in Palika Bazaar and irregularities in matters relating to Gensture Hotels and Aresco Restaurant. The inquiry by the Pathak panel was started on orders of home minister Rajnath Singh two years ago. Singh acted on a complaint filed by whistleblower and former NDMC officer B N Singh. 
 
 In its report, the Pathak committee had concluded that then chairman Jalaj Srivastava allowed Le Meridien to get away with a payment of Rs 151.92 crore in licence fee dues to NDMC, while the arrears were much higher, and it caused a loss of Rs 400 crore to the civic body.
 
 The CBI, after receiving the MHA report, has already registered a preliminary enquiry where it is examining the role of Srivastava, among others. The MHA panel found merit in Singh's allegations that Srivastava and his junior, Himanshu Ranjan, indulged in several irregularities. Taking into account these allegations, the council under CM Arvind Kejriwal had cancelled the luxury hotel's licence recently. However, Srivastav has alleged that the CM was misled by the civic body.
