 will soon be seen in Siddharth Kumar Tewary’s ' ' as  , the mother of all asuras, who is on par with Mahakaali (Puja Sharma). Well, there was more than one reason for her to take up the show. She says, “My husband (Apurva Agnihotri) and I are firm believers of Mata Rani. The show came at an auspicious time (Navratri) and there was no reason to say no.”

 The actress says that she has been making only cameo appearances on shows as she was tired of wearing make-up and doing the same thing for eight long years on 'Kyunkii Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi'. “I was tired of doing that and hence, took a break of four years and made only cameo appearances. It took five hours for me to get ready for the part during the look test, but now I take just about an hour for it,” she says, adding, “In fact, when people fail to convince me to take up a daily soap, they call up my husband for it. I start crying when Apurva forces me to take up TV shows, so he tells me to go easy and take up whatever suits me.”
