HYDERABAD: Come April 1, Hyderabadis possessing   will get a unique identification number (UIN). And to obtain this, those in possession of weapons should provide their information before the now extended deadline of March 31. Those failing to secure the UIN before the deadline may face legal consequences. 

 
 The   has nearly completed the process of uploading data of 6,000 arms licences in the   (NDAL) portal to generate UIN for every weapon owner. "The process of uploading data in the NDAL portal is almost complete in Telangana. But some gun licence holders have still not submitted details. They can do so by March 31, failing which the arms licences will become invalid," a senior official told TOI. 
 
 The reason for providing UIN to every arms licence holder is to control gun culture in the city. Though most weapon owners do not misuse their weapons, there have been certain instances when licence holders lent their guns to others for criminal use in different parts of the country. It is to keep track of this that the ministry of home affairs (MHA) decided to provide UIN.
  
  
 
 The process began in July 2016 when the software related to the National Database Arms Licence (NDAL) and the Arms Licence Issuance System (ALIS) was launched. The Telangana home department has been collecting data since then, but is yet to get details from all licence holders.
 
 The UIN will contain details like name of the licensee, date of birth, profession, current address, police jurisdiction, landline number, mobile number, office where the arms registration took place, office where the licence was issued and the licence number. Till date, over 4,000 licence holders in Hyderabad and 2,000 in Cyberabad have complied with the provisions. A total of 7,000 people have uploaded their details in the state.
 
 In Hyderabad, most of the   are descendants of  , followed by politicians, realtors, movie artistes and sportspersons.
