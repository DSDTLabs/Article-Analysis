AMBALA: Haryana chief minister   on Monday launched a mobile   that has been designed to inform people about various welfare schemes and programmes of the state government. In the first phase, information about more than 250 schemes and programmes of 30 different departments has been made available on the eSewa mobile app.

 Khattar congratulated Ambala deputy commissioner (DC)   and his entire team for developing the app and said it will be useful to people. The DC informed the CM that schemes and programmes of other departments of the state government would also be added later on.
