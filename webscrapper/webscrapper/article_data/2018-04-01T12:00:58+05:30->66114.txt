PATNA: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Saturday sent the samples of fake Indian currency   (FICN) seized from Dighalbank in Kishanganj district on March 29 to the crime control and fake currency wing at   Printing Press of central government for forensic analysis.

 DRI sleuths had seized the fake notes of Rs1,99,500 face value from one Anwarul Haq (25) of   in   district of West Bengal. They said 75 pieces of fake currency of Rs2000 denomination and 99 pieces of Rs500 denomination were seized.
 
 A senior DRI official said the consignment was picked up from a person in Jhapha district of Nepal. “The supplier is also involved in drug and arms smuggling in India,” he said.
 
 “According to our sources, the FICN consignment was brought to Kathmandu from Islamabad in Pakistan by air,” he said.
 
 “Anwarul said the fake currency was made available at 45% in original currency, meaning thereby that FICN of Rs1,00,000 face value was available at Rs45,000,” the DRI official said.
 
 “Earlier, FICN of Rs1,000 face value and discontinued after demonetisation on November 8, 2016, matched 95% with the original note, but many features of an original Rs2000 note are missing in the fake notes. Fake notes of Rs500 face value match only 45% of the features of original currency as these have been printed and circulated only after the demonetisation of old notes,” he said.
