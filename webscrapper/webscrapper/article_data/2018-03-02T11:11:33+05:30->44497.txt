MYSURU: Work, vote and get paid. That’s Mysuru zilla panchayat’s idea to improve voting percentage in tribal hamlets of the district in the assembly elections.

 The Mysuru ZP has decided to use the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme ( ). Under the scheme, on polling day, the beneficiaries will get work as well as money to ensure they vote without fail.
 
  P Shivashankar said a concern of the   with respect to high voter turnout is migration of tribals in summer to coffee estates in search of jobs. “If tribals migrate to the neighbouring district for jobs, naturally they won’t be able to vote. To ensure they don’t move out of their hamlets, we have decided to provide them work under the NREGA this election season,” he said.
 
 “Under NREGA, we consider the amount of work completed for payment. On polling day, we want our officers to ensure these people will complete work by 9am and visit their polling booths to vote. They’ll be paid the prescribed wage,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the district administration has started mapping people with special needs to ensure they too can vote. “Our aim is to provide whatever facilities they need,” said an officer working on this aspect.
 
 The district administration has also decided to set up an award at the booth level for officers who ensure highest voter enrolment and voting in tribal areas.
 
 Deputy commissioner D Randeep said historically a section of the society, especially tribal, SC/ST and other marginalised sections, are left out of the voting process. “We have launched a multipronged strategy under the Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP). We want to ensure everyone votes as it’s their right,” he said.
