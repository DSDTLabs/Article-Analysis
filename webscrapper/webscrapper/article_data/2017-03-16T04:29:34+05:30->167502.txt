NEW DELHI: AAP has found itself on a sticky wicket over the   bypolls. AAP’s   who vacated the   seat in January to contest the Punjab elections not only lost in Lambi but is also unlikely to be fielded again for the bypolls on April 9.

 Singh told TOI that he would accept the party’s decision. A senior party member confirmed that a new   would be fielded and would probably be another Sikh face. Rajouri Garden has a heavy Sikh population.
 
 Singh, who had gained notoriety when he threw a shoe at the then home minister P Chidambaram in 2009 to protest against the government inaction in the 1984 anti-Sikh riot cases, first represented AAP from west Delhi during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and then successfully contested the 2015 assembly polls from Rajouri Garden. AAP now faces the dilemma of having to return to the constituency and ask for votes afresh. It might not have been so embarrassing had Singh won in Punjab. Party sources said a loss might not be far-fetched and the results to be announced just before the corporation elections might send a wrong message to the rest of Delhi.
 
 However, a senior member said, “The decision to field Singh from Punjab was political and just because he resigned does not mean that no work is taking place in that constituency. The government is taking pro-people measures for all of Delhi. Our campaign will talk about the governnment’s developmental work.”
