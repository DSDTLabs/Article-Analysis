NASHIK: The corporators from Nashik Road on Monday demanded that the civic body deploy security guards at the international   to keep anti-social elements away. 

 At the civic standing committee meeting, Shiv Sena corporator of prabhag 21 Suryakant Lavate said miscreants jumped over the walls of the swimming pool in the afternoon, when it was closed and no   employee was present. 
 
 “Anti-social elements enter the compound, consume alcohol and create a ruckus. Security guards are a must at the swimming pool,” he said. 
 
 When the swimming pool is open in the mornings and evenings, there is security at the gate and also inside the office. Lavate said people take advantage of the absence security personnel in the afternoons and misuse the place. 
 
 “We have seen some boys inside the compound when the pool is closed but we did not notice if they were consuming liquor,” said Lata Jadhav, a local resident who visits the pool often. 
 
 Rohan Patil, another local resident, said the miscreants must be climbing over the wall from the backside of the pool as people would have noticed them if they jumped over the wall at the entrance. “Nevertheless, security is needed when the pool is closed.” 
 
 On Monday, chairman of the standing committee asked the concerned department to look into the issue and resolve it. 
 
 Security at water tanks: The corporators also demanded armed security at the water tanks in Panchavati as these were not secure. E-tenders would be floated for this purpose because the security agencies deploying guards did not have gunmen.
