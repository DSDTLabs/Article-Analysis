CHENNAI: Aligning with the BJP would help veteran actor Rajinikanth assume power in  , according to Thuglaq magazine editor S  , who said that the combination of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rajinikanth would do wonders for people of Tamil Nadu. 

 Speaking on the sidelines of the national executive committee meeting of Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), in which Rajini's political opponent   also participated, Gurumurthy said that bringing together the administrative nous of Modi and the mass appeal of Rajini would work like magic. He, however, denied that he was advising Rajini on his political entry. "If people think I am advising Rajinikanth, then I am proud of that," he said.
 
 Haasan and Gurumurthy did not share the dais during the event. Kamal, who spoke earlier, was on his way out when Gurumurthy walked in. The duo acknowledged each other and shook hands.
 
 Both were asked to comment on the ongoing Cauvery water sharing dispute. While Gurumurthy sought to shift blame for the delay in setting up of Cauvery Management Board away from Modi, Haasan said the issue was not insurmountable. "If politics will just stand aside, then logic and logistics will fall into place. Then, we can quickly solve the problem," Haasan said, adding that the issue should be "left to actual users" of Cauvery river like farmers.
 
 Yet to contest polls, Haasan was asked by an audience member if defeat would mean the end of his political journey, to which Kamal retorted that it wouldn't be. "I will continue my (political) journey despite failure. I started the journey to challenge status quo, to tell my people that integrity and honesty has a place in politics. This (politics) is the rest of my life," he said.
