Madurai: The marigold season, when flowers in yellow and orange are in demand, has started and farmers who cultivated the hybrid variety of the flowers in Ambatturai near Chinnalapatti in Dindigul district are overjoyed as the blooms are big and so are the returns. 

 Farmers in Ambatturai, Uthupatti, Kamalapuram, Perumalkovilpatti, Jathikoundanpatti, Theppampatti near Chinnalapatti, and Patchaimalayankottai, Nadupatti, Kurmbatti villagers near Sempatti in the district cultivate flowers in a large area. The flowers they produce are more in demand for their colour and decorative value rather than the fragrance.
 
 Pandi, a farmer from Sempatti, says that last year too, they had tried their best to cultivate the flower crop with great difficulty, as there was huge scarcity of water and many of the farmers had to buy water from tankers to water the crops. “But in spite of that many of the plants withered and many farmers could not get back the money they spent on just cultivating the crop, leave alone profits,” he said.
 
 But this year’s rain had been just right for the crop to start flowering in September, and now the blooms are ready. The ball-sized blooms in intense yellow and orange colours are in demand. “It is the soil that gives colour to the bloom, and this year conditions were conducive and all the farmers are reaping good results,” said Senthil Kumar, a farmer.
 
 As all the temples have festivals, these flowers are needed for decorations. These farmers say that they are able to pick about 300 kg to 400 kg of flowers per acre once a week and with each kilo fetching Rs 50, they are making good profits.
 
 “It is more than five years since we started seeing profits in flower cultivation, and this year Mother Nature has been good to us,” says a farmer, who is hopeful that the prices would increase as the season progresses.
