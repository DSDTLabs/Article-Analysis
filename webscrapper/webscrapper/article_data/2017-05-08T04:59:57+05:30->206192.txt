 BJP chief   kicked off the party’s election campaign in the state, 10 months ahead of the scheduled assembly polls, addressing a huge rally here on Sunday.
 
 Launching an attack on CM Manik Sarkar’s “moral right” to stay in power, Shah said, “Tripura fares the worst when it comes to the safety of women. They are the biggest victims of atrocities here and crime against women is the highest in the country. However, the Left Front government remains silent about the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.”
 
 Shah said the saffron party will ensure a one-on-one fight against   to bring an end to its 25-year rule, adding that all “necessary steps” will be taken to unite opposition votes. Despite the scorching heat, the rally witnessed a nearly 20,000-strong turnout, with a significant presence of tribals, Muslims and women.
 
 Reiterating his accusation of corruption by CPM netas, Shah brought up the Rose Valley scam, alleging that the government did not pursue a CBI investigation into the scam despite “repeated demands”. “As per law, no one can ask the CBI to start an investigation except the state government or the court. If Manik Sarkar is not involved in the scam, let him request the CBI to launch an investigation,” he said. He added, “So far, the Modiled government has given Rs 35,000 crore to Tripura under different schemes. These funds were not utilised properly, which is why the state is underdeveloped.”
 
 Bringing up the development of tribal communities, Shah said, “CPM speaks about the development of tribals. However, in practice, tribals, minorities and other backward classes are the worst victims of Manik Sarkar’s maladministration.” Asked for a response to the rally, CPM declined to comment.
