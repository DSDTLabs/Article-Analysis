Veteran musician   has revealed he once upset his daughter   by 'hitting on' her 'best girlfriend'  .

 
 
 
 The 70-year-old   frontman said he was leaving a party thrown by designer   with Liv and Diaz, when he asked the   actor if he could take her out leaving his daughter unimpressed.
 
 "Yes I have. And I got a lot of s**t for it too," Tyler said during an appearance on a show.
 
 ''I look at this beautiful woman. I said, 'Cameron, should you ever need someone to take you to the movies or you know, like, if I was to, you know, ask you to show me around London...' And of course, Liv went, 'Daddy, you're hitting on my best girlfriend!' And I got ashamed for a moment," he added.
