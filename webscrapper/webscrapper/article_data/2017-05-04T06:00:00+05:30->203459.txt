Rolling in the aisles — that’s how Hyderabadis spent their Sunday evening this week. In a fund raising event,  , a Delhi-based stand-up comedian, made the audience crease up with laughter as he cracked jokes on every profession. “Love marriage is not possible for doctors because their love letter needs to be taken to chemists to be read,” he said, drawing guffaws from the crowd of around 350. After the one and half hour of non-stop laughter, the comedian was swarmed by the fans for selfies which he happily obliged.
