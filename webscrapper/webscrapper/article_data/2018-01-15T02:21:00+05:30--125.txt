Ongole: HRD minister   Srinivasa Rao said that the state government is taking steps to strengthen universities by filling up all  . He said that about 1,345 assistant professor posts in universities will be filled in two phases.

 On Sunday, the minister inspected the buildings in Edugundlapadu village on the outskirts of Ongole city, which will house IIIT. He held discussions with officials, and with owners of a private college, which was closed down.
 
 Later, speaking to reporters, Rao said that the process of filling up of vacancies in universities has been dragging for about a decade. “Previous governments completely neglected the universities. We will turn all universities into prime educational institutions,” he said.
 
 Rao said classes for IIIT, Ongole, will begin from the next academic year in temporary buildings. He said that about 3,000 students will be accommodated in the new IIIT. Five of the seven universities granted under AP reorganisation Act, have started functioning from temporary buildings, and the remaining two will start from the next academic year. Rao said that permanent buildings for all universities will come up shortly after the Centre releases funds.
 
 The minister criticised opposition leader Jaganmohan Reddy for making derogatory and offensive comments against chief minister Chandrababu Naidu. “The chief minister is representative of 5 crore people of the state. He is an elderly person and also the most experienced leader. People will not accept the comment being made by Jagan.”
