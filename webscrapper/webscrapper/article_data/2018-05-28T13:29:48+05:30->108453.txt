BHUBANESWAR: Prime Minister Narendra   on Sunday showered praises on D Prakash  , a tea seller from  , for his noble deed of educating poor slum kids of his locality. Modi narrated Rao’s story while addressing the nation during his monthly radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’.

 
 “Rao has been a tea vendor in Cuttack for the past five decades. You will be surprised to know that the lives of more than 70 children are being illuminated through education due to his efforts. He has opened a school named ‘Asha Ashvaasan’, spending 50 per cent of his income for children living in slums and hutments. He ensures education, health and meals for all the children coming to this school,” said Modi who met Rao during his Cuttack visit on Saturday.
 
 He congratulated Rao for his hard work, his persistence and for providing a new direction to the lives of those poor children attending his school. “He has banished the darkness from their lives. His life is an inspiration to us, our society and the whole country,” said the prime minister.
 
 Rao along with his kids had met Modi a few minutes before the public meeting begins at Cuttack. 
 
 Rao, while talking to TOI, expressed his happiness over his date with the PM and the latter's words of appreciation in radio. “I could not believe when an officer from the Prime Minister’s office requested me to give time for a meeting with the PM. My happiness knew no bound when I finally meet Modi at 4.45 pm on Saturday. He spent 18 minutes before he entered into the dais of the public meeting. Today, I am honoured when he told my story to the entire nation for 2.36 minutes,” he added.
