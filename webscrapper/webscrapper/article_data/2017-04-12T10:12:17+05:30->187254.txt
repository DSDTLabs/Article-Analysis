AHMEDABAD: In a boost to   (GTU), the state   has approved the transfer   from   (VEC) to GTU. The varsity earlier had just 23 acres to its name.

 With the 28 acres held by VEC going to GTU, the land with the varsity will add up to 51 acres. This is aimed at making the varsity eligible for 12(B) certification from the University Grants Commission (UGC), for which the minimum land requirement is 100 acres. With a 12(B) certification, affiliated institutes or varsities are eligible for financial assistance and grants from the central government and UGC.
 
 GTU had sought 100 acres from the state government but despite offering a few options near Gandhinagar, the government refused to grant the varsity enough land. Some 10 years after its establishment, GTU is yet to get the 12(B) certification. Bipin Bhatt, registrar of GTU, said, “Apart from the campus at Chandkheda, the regional centres will come up at Rajkot, Surat, Vadodara and Gandhinagar, so students and institute authorities do not have to visit the main campus every now and then.”
