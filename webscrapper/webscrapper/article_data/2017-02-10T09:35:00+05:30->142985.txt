JALANDHAR: An activist has complained to the   (ECI) urging a high-level inquiry into lifting of nakas (checkposts) across   two days prior to polling day of February 4 as the step resulted in transportation and distribution of all kinds of inducements used in the polls, including liquor, drugs and money.

 In his complaint to the ECI, Nawanshahr activist   pointed out that that just two days prior to holding of polls on February 4 in the state, all police nakas were lifted without any reason or justification.
 
 “Earlier, these nakas had been in force nearly three weeks before the polls and had been quite successful in ensuring proper implementation of code of conduct. However, lifting of these police checkposts virtually resulted in transportation and distribution of all kinds of inducements used in the polls by candidates of various parties without any hindrances,“ he claimed.
 
 “I was left aghast when all of a sudden no policeman was seen anywhere in the state at the nakas from the evening of February 2 till the completion of polling,“   said.
