CHENNAI: A truckers body-All   of Goods Vehicle Owners' Association (ACOGA) -- has said its members would go on strike from June 18, protesting rise in diesel prices and steep increase in motor insurance premium for trucks. "Overall there are 90 lakh trucks plying on Indian roads. Our association members from across the country are impacted. We are going ahead with the strike," B  , president of the association said.

 
 "Last fiscal has been the toughest period due to the government not even listening to the woes of the truckers. There have been incessant fuel price increases. High toll charges also don't commensurate with the infrastructure development around the toll points," the association said in a statement.
 
 "The steep increase in third party insurance premium on commercial vehicles has dented our viability," Reddy said. 
 
 "Various representation on all these issues over the year has fallen on deaf ears in the government. It has not even met the representatives to listen to their points, leave aside addressing and resolving them," he said.
 
 ACOGOA made last ditch effort on April 23 and announced that if the representation is not heard of, they will have no other option but to ground their vehicles from June 18.
