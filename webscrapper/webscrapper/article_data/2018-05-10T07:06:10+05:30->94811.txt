PANAJI: After a   constable died due to alcoholism, Goa police is now set to identify police personnel who consume  .

 
 Inspector general of police (IGP)   has written to all superintendents of police (SP)s to direct inspectors in their jurisdiction to identify police personnel who drink alcohol and submit a list.
 
 
  
 
 “We want to collect data on whether Goa police personnel are addicted and, if necessary, will intervene,” he said. The IGP said that there is nothing to suggest that Goa’s cops are addicted to alcohol. “We have to find out whether there is a serious problem or if this was an isolated incident.”
 
 
 
 
 A constable attached to the Bicholim police station died due to alcoholism.
 
 Singh, in his letter, said that police are an emergency service and personnel have to interface with the public day and night. He added that a drunk policeman presents a pathetic scenario and tarnishes the image of the force.
 
 Stressing on the need to identify such drinking police personnel, Singh said that a counselling programme may be devised to help them.
 
 He further stressed that SPs should emphasise that police personnel should desist from consuming alcohol while on duty and also on the bad effects of excessive drinking.
