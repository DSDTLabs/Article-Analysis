AHMEDABAD:  , 18, became perhaps the first woman trap shooter from Gujarat to bag two golds at  . In the ongoing 27th edition of the competition at Patiala in Punjab, Sadiya won in both junior women and open categories in which she had participated.

 A native of   in Surendranagar district, Sadiya is currently doing her BA in economics from St Xavier's College in Ahmedabad. She took to shooting after watching her brother take part in competitions.
 
 Muzahid Malik, Sadiya's father, said that when they realized that she was serious about taking up shooting as a sport, they engaged a coach in Delhi with whom she started training in June this year.
 
 "We feel very proud of her achievement as she emerged victorious against all odds," he said. "Due to the lack of facilities back home, such as a proper shooting range, she shuttles between Delhi and Gujarat to achieve her dream of representing India one day," Sadiya's father said. He further said that her win in the prestigious event would encourage other girls to take up the sport, thus popularizing it in Gujarat.
 
 In July this year, Sadiya had represented Gujarat in west zone championship in Pune where she had won silver medal.
 
 "I am happy about the medals that I have won," she said.
 
 "They have boosted my confidence and encouraged me to participate in the upcoming nationals and the trials for the Indian shooting team. The team is to be chosen for various international competitions that would start from November. There are only a few women shooters from Gujarat and even fewer in the trap shooting event," Sadiya said.
