NASHIK: More than 5,000 chemists and druggists in Nashik district have decided to join the   called by the All India   & Druggists on May 30. 

 Medical stores will remain closed for the 24 hours starting from May 30 midnight to protest against the proposal by the central health ministry to regulate sale of drugs through e-portal and to implement online pharmacy.
 
 Rajendra Dhamne, president of the Nashik Chemists Association, said as they don't want emergency services and patients suffer, the medical shop owners have made special arrangements at   in Gole Colony (near Ashok Stambh). 
 
 "Senior members of our association will be present at Chemist Bhavan during the strike period. Those who need medicines in emergency situations may visit Chemist Bhavan with prescription and documents. We will arrange medicines for them," said Dhamne. 
 
 The chemists will take out a silent march from Chemist Bhavan to the district collector's office on May 30 evening and submit a memorandum of demands to the collector. 
 
 Yogesh Bagrecha, former secretary of Chemists and Druggists Association (central zone), said, "Day-to-day feeding of drugs sale and purchase data online is just not possible. In Nashik district, we have 2,000 members in rural areas who don't have access of high speed internet, which is necessary for the e-platform," he said. 
 
 The chemists said, after the introduction of GST from July 1, they will have to submit records three times a month. "Most of us have to appoint an accountant to submit details for the GST. Uploading daily business details on e-platform will be an additional work," Bagrecha said. 
 
 They association also demanded action against online medicine portals, e-pharmacies and online drug players. "The law says that medicines should be sold in the presence of qualified pharmacist only. The concept of online sale of medicines contradicts with this basic rule," said Hemant Pathak.
