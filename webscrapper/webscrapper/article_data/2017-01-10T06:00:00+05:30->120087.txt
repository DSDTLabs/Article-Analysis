Visakhapatnam: Andhra University (AU) authorities are planning to modernise most of the laboratories in the campus partly with the Rs 10 crore corpus fund grant made by the state government after inspecting the condition of some of the laboratories at the Science College and Women’s Engineering College.

 In the last one year, the university authorities developed a state-of-the-art laboratory for research in data analytics and also modernised the chemistry laboratory with the help of Laurus Laboratories. 
 
 The pharmacology laboratory also received a shot in the arm, thanks to a massive Rs 4 crore donation five years ago from a former student apart from funds provided by the ministry of environmental sciences. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, AU registrar Prof V Uma Maheswara Rao said, “Till recently, the shortage of funds for infrastructure development ensured that many of our laboratories were stuck with equipment that were decades old. We had little funds even to spruce up the buildings. However, now we are making an effort to build our labs and research infrastructure.” When asked if their efforts were fruitful, the registrar observed that so far, the progress made has been good and pointed out that the Rs 10 crore corpus fund would improve things further.
 
 Regarding the development of independent laboratory facilities at the AU College of Engineering for Women, the registrar said, “They will have totally independent brand new laboratories for all branches by March.”
