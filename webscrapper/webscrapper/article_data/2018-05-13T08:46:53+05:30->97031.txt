PANAJI: Scooping out sand with bated breath, staff from the forest department peered into the Olive Ridley   nest at Agonda beach. Soon, a sad sight unfoldeddecayed eggs. All of the 120-odd eggs laid 59 days ago had rotted.

 This was on May 6, nearly a fortnight after the storm surge flooded some of Goa’s beaches. Morjim, another turtle nesting site located in Pernem, was spared the destructive impact as the nests there are located almost on the sand dunes, out of harm’s way. “There was no impact on the nests. Only shacks came in the line of the flood,” a source in the forest department said.
 
 But in Agonda, the higher tidal surge appeared to have soaked the nests. In Galgibaga, the adjoining beach further south, forest staff scooped out the nest on May 9 after the due incubation period.
 
  “Only three hatchlings crawled out and were released. We are still waiting,” an official said. Hatchlings emerge from a nest after around 55 days of the eggs being laid.
 
 Forest officials have also been observing that the flippered visitors have been increasingly delaying their landing onto Goa’s shores over the past couple of years. The period from October to March and early April generally constitutes the season for turtle nesting, but on May 1, a week after the storm, forest staff were surprised to see another Olive   at Agonda. This means that its eggs would have to be incubated till almost the end of June, that is if they are not damaged by the monsoon by then.
 
 There has been some relief, nonetheless, as the second of the four remaining nests at Agonda yielded 52 Olive Ridleys out of 70 eggs. Hatchlings are yet to emerge from four more nests, two each in Agonda and Galgibaga.
 
 Experts are unwilling to confirm whether these phenomena are offshoots of climate change. “These are chance events so far and it is really not possible to generalise from such small numbers,” an ecologist said.
