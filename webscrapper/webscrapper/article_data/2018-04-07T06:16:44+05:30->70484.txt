CHANDIGARH: The cabinet sub-committee on mining would submit its report within a fortnight. State local government minister Navjot Singh   disclosed this after presiding over a meeting of the cabinet sub-committee on mining with all the government as well as the private stakeholders associated with mining.

 â€˜He said that the new policy would be in accordance with the sand mining framework issued by the Union mining ministry in March. Sidhu added that before giving final touches to the policy, he would personally meet the officers of the Union ministry on Monday and the cabinet sub-committee would again meet on Tuesday.
 
 During the meeting, two contractors from Ludhiana complained against the SHO of Sidhwan Bet and said that the officer harasses them and is himself embroiled in illegal mining.
