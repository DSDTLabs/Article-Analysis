FAIZABAD: 
 
Rizvi also offered prayers at the disputed site and met Ram Janmabhoomi chief priest Acharya Satyendra Das.
 
 Talking to reporters, Rizvi said, “Those who are secular have never been against the temple. Those who are opposing Ram Janmabhoomi temple in Ayodhya and want to build Babri Mosque at the site should go to Pakistan or Bangladesh. There is no place for fundamentalist Muslims in India.”
 
 “Ayodhya is a sacred place for Hindus, so Masjid should not be built in Ayodhya. Those who want a masjid there should go and join forces of ISIS chief Abu Baqar Baghdadi,” said Rizvi.
 
 He further said that fundamentalists like Zakir Naik should join ISIS in Syria. Fundamentalist clerics are trying to destroy the country and they should migrate to Pakistan or Afghanistan.
 
 Rizwan Mustafa Rizvi, vice president, Save Waqf India, said, “We demand immediate arrest of Waseem Rizvi. He is communalizing the atmosphere by his hate statements.”
 
 Earlier, Rizvi had stirred a controversy by saying that children studying in madrassas turned into terrorists. He had asked the state and central governments to ban all madrassas and initiate inquiries into them.
