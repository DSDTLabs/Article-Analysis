‘Pink’ actress   was under fire from all sides when she took a dig at veteran Telugu film director K  , who launched her with ‘Jhummandi Naadam’ in 2010, his obsession with actresses’ navels, and his love to decorate heroines’ navels with fruits to add ‘sensuality’ to his films. Her comments drew huge criticism from everyone and the actress was heavily trolled on social media.

    took to social media on July 14 and posted a video in which she apologized to K Raghavendra Rao. “It is not in my upbringing that I will hurt anyone who has been such an important part of my journey. Raghavendra Rao garu is the reason why I am here in the industry in the first place, and I can never forget that. It’s just strange how everyone alleged that I insulted him, but I didn’t, I will never. So I really want to apologise if I have hurt anyone’s sentiment. But trust me, I did not intend to.”
 
  Taapsee further said that she was only making fun of herself. “It took me a little while to understand what was wrong in my comments because I thought that it was me I was making fun of – of how unfit I was for this industry and how I was so clueless about whatever was happening with me in the industry. I really wanted to make fun of myself and nothing else. I felt it is great if you can laugh at your own self. But in the process, if I have, by mistake hurt anyone, I am really sorry,” she said in the video.
