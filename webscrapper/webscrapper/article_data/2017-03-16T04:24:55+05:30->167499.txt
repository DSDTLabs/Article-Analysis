NEW DELHI: The parliamentary standing committee report on   traffic situation has slammed police for being unable to control snarls. 

 The report suggested that the policemen should conduct surveys to prepare a meticulous traffic management plan for arterial roads to ensure free movement of vehicles.
 
 It also recommended that the traffic cops should identify alternate parking spots and turn some of the arterial roads into one-ways to control the excess volume.
 
 As per the   data about one crore vehicles are registered in Delhi, out of which more than 20 lakh ply on the road every day. 
 
 Police sources said that a task force comprising policemen, civic body officials and other stakeholders have been formed to frame a policy to reduce congestions.
