AHMEDABAD: The 2002 Naroda Patia massacre convict   will get an attendant to assist him in his day-to-day work in Sabarmati Central Jail.

 The state government and jail authorities have assured Gujarat high court on Monday that the jail would give services of an attendant to Bajrangi, who is suffering from failing eyesight.
 
 This arrangement has been worked out after Bajrangi requested the court to grant him regular bail on the ground that he is losing his eyesight and hence he should be released so that he could get proper treatment. Earlier too, on various occasions, Bajrangi had sought temporary bail for treatment of his declining vision.
 
 After senior counsel P G Desai assured the court that the jail authorities would take proper care of Bajrangi by providing him an attendant, Bajrangi withdrew his bail application. In response to Bajrangiâ€™s bail plea, the HC had asked for a report on how the former   leader is conducting his prison stay.
 
 In August 2012, a special SIT court had sentenced Bajrangi to life imprisonment till death in the case in which 97 people were killed on February 28, 2002, a day after a violent mob torched coach S6 of   and killed 59 passengers including karsevaks returning from Ayodhya. The court convicted 32 persons including Bajrangi and former minister  , who was granted bail by the high court on health grounds.
