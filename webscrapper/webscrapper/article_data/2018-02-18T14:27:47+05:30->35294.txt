MADURAI: Students and parents were put to much inconvenience on Saturday as   who were to participate in the 46th annual convocation of MSS   College arrived over two-and-a-half hours late. 

 The college administration had made elaborate arrangements for the convocation and ministers Sellur K Raju, K P Anbazhagan and   were to participate in it.
 
  Invitations sent out by the college administration said that the audience and graduates would have to be in their seats by 9.30 a.m as the programme would begin promptly at 10 a.m.
 
 Many of the parents with small children accompanying them and the students who were to receive their degrees had skipped their breakfast to be at the venue on time. The makeshift stage under the shamiana started getting hot as time went by and there was no sign of the ministers arriving. ``They have said that lunch would be served, but as they have not come till noon, it would mean I will have to stay up to 3 p.m, which is too late for a diabetic patient like me,’’ said a parent who left the venue without witnessing his son receiving the degree.
 
 Finally, the ministers arrived at the venue around 12.45 pm, almost by the time it should have wound up. As many as 350 students were given their degrees by the ministers after which they planted trees on the college premises. A wall of kindness was also inaugurated as part of the convocation.
