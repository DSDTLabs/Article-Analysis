 Saroo recalled how as a 5-year-old he had fallen asleep on a bench at Burhanpur station while his brother was away. He had hopped on to a train hoping it would take him home. Instead, it took him to Howrah.
 
 His next stop was a local police station before he landed at Liluah's juvenile detention centre. 'That was a scary place. I'd never want any 5-year-old to be there, I was beaten up for speaking Hindi, not Bengali. It was like a war prison' he said.
 
 After 25 years of separation, how does he communicate with his biological mother? 'I've met her 15 times in 4 years. I speak to her twice a month through a translator.' Does she scold him for boarding the train? 'She doesn't cry over split milk.'
