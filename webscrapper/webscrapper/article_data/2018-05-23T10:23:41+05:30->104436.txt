NAGPUR: Reacting to NU’s crackdown, an unfazed Sunil   said the administration was hounding him since long, as he was exposing scams by top officials, particularly of registrar  . He accused vice chancellor SP Kane of indulging in contempt of court by deciding to lodge a police complaint against him at Sitabuldi police station.

 Kane clarified that there was nothing personal in the action against Mishra, and all decisions were taken by NU’s statutory bodies while keeping in mind all rules and regulations. “Though Mishra targeted me and my daughter, we acted as per rules and after seeking legal opinion,” he said.
 
 “It’s certainly a black day in university’s history, as a person of the VC’s stature has stooped to lowest level by acting against me on the orders of  . The VC should have studied the law before making such moves. He should know that a person can’t be punished twice for the same crime as per the rules of ‘double jeopardy’,” he said, while adding that the VC has lost moral right to continue on the position.
 
 The CIIMC director said his case was taken as “non-cognizable offence” and was let off with fine by the HC. “VC and Meshram must answer why I was targeted when there were 108 accused named in the Kohchade scam. What do they actually want to prove?”
 
 He alleged that Kane had approached him last week, after he filed a case against him and daughter Shivangi, charging the VC with conflict of interest and misusing his position when he was exam controller.
 
 He further threatened NU administration that he will expose more scams and misdeeds. “As they started the revenge fight, I will reply with full vigour and force for getting justice,” he warned.
