Ropar: The Punjab power engineers held a protest outside the Ropar thermal power plant, two units of which have recently been shut down by the state government. The power engineers, affiliated with the  , said the government policy was pushing the state towards ‘over-dependence’ on private players which can monopolize the power sector in years to come.

 The engineers demanded that the government should have first approved setting up of the supercritical thermal unit at Ropar before doing away with the outdated units.
 
 Sanjeev Sood, president of the association, said the closure of thermal units was not as per guidelines of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), which does not mandate closure of reheat plants.   said Rs 715 crore has been spent on the renovation of the Bathinda Thermal plant which had extended its life till 2022-2029. Similarly, at Ropar Rs 150 crores were spent for renovation of unit 1 and 2, he added.
 
 Padamjit Singh, chief patron  , said unwarranted haste has been shown by the government in closing the units and these units should be considered for closure after commissioning of proposed supercritical units. He said Punjab had purchased 6,095 million units from   thermal plant in the year 2017-18 for which a sum of Rs 3,293 crores were paid to the private player at a cost of 5.40 per unit. However, cheaper power was available in the market. He said it was imperative to review the power purchase agreements with private thermals instead of the closure of the state sector thermal units.
