BHAGALPUR: The National   (NTPC)’s Khahalgaon Super Thermal Power Station (KhSTPS) has generated record 15,794.91 million units of electricity in the   2016-2017.
 
  According to KhSTPS’s group general manager (GGM)  , the 2340-MW plant’s operational efficiency touched 93.96% during the financial year.
  
  “The NTPC is striving to produce low-cost electricity. That’s why we have stopped using  . We have also achieved zero-effluent discharge to make the region pollution free,” Samuel said.
  
  Talking to newsmen on Wednesday, Samuel further said the KhSTPS effectively regulated coal supplies from the Eastern Coalfields Limited (Lalmatia, Jharkhand) so as to cut the production cost. “The company also aims to produce 10 MW electricity through solar energy,” he said.
  
  Referring to social obligations of the power plant, the GGM said the KhSTPS would now focus on providing pure and safe drinking water to the villages adjoining the plant. A sanitation drive has also been launched in the region under the ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ as part of the NTPC’s corporate  
  
  “Our pollution control measures include, besides sustained zero- effluent discharge, production of compost and production of biogas. We have also planted around 10.2 lakh trees,” Samuel said.
