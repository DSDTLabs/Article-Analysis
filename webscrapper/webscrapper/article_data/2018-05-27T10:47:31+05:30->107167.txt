PATNA: The state   will launch a fortnight-long campaign on Sunday to mark the completion of four years of   government at the Centre.

 Instructions have been issued to the party’s present and former MPs, MLAs and MLCs, as well as state and district office-bearers to join the small groups of local workers at the booth and panchayat levels to interact with people. The exercise will continue till June 11.
 
 The ‘tolis’ or groups concerned have been asked to garner support of at least 50 families or 250 people at every booth.
