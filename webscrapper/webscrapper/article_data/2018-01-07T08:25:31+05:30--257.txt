TRICHY: Atheist and rationalists all around the world are under threat, said   MP K   on the second day of the World Atheist Conference, organised by Dravidar Kazhagam in   on Saturday.

 She hoped the believers or religious minded attending the conference see the “true light of Periyar. The people who have congregated here are already atheist. Even then why we have gathered? Why do we have to preach ourselves when we have already converted? But we have to come together to show that we are together and what humanity means to the world,” she said. She said no religion treats   equal to a man in every aspect, be it Hinduism, Christianity or Islam. “All religion says a woman has to obey a man. Women have been denied their rights in every religion. That was the reason Periyar denied all religion,” Kanimozhi said.
 
 “There are reformers and feminist around the world who are fighting for women’s rights. I respect all of them, but there is one true feminist in this world and that is Periyar,” she said.
 
 “Religion is nothing but fear. How much blood has been shed, how many wars have been fought in this world because of religion?,” she asked, adding, “God has never killed anyone for their wrongdoing and has remained a spectator. He would never act or react.”
 
 “There is a threat for all atheists and rationalists around the world. To show our strength, we all should stand united and fight against hatred. Atheism and humanism are the only truths,” she said.
