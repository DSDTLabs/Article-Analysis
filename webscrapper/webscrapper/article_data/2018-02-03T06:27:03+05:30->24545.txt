KOLKATA: Junior doctors at   (CNMCH) on Friday staged a demonstration, demanding adequate security, after three of them were assaulted by a patient’s family on Thursday. The doctors called off the agitation late in the evening only after a meeting with the college principal, who assured to step up safety measures. 

 The doctors struck work in batches so that hospital services were not disrupted but they barricaded the entrance to the emergency, causing much inconvenience to patients and their families. Even ambulances had to make a detour and enter the hospital through a gate on  . “The frequent attacks on doctors have forced us to take this step. The three doctors assaulted are still receiving treatment,” said a junior doctor. “We want an assurance from the hospital.” 
 
  Though emergency, OPD and in-house services remained unaffected, the barricade at the emergency gate caused trouble for patients. Jhuma Das from  , who had brought her ailing father-in-law to the hospital, had to escort the 60-year-old in a wheelchair through the busy street after a check-up at the emergency. “Doctors attended to my father-in-law. But it was a problem taking him in and out of the emergency, especially as he can’t walk properly,” she said. Poonam Shaw from   had difficulty figuring out whether the emergency was open or not. “With the barricade and a police picket at the gate, we thought the emergency was shut. Then someone directed us to another gate,” she said. 
 
 The protesters removed the barricades after Dr Debasis Bhattacharya, director of medical education, urged them to resume work. Subsequently, they called off the agitation in the evening. “We do not want to inconvenience patients but is it fair that we be assaulted on the slightest pretext? All we demand is security so that we can attend patients without fear,” said a junior doctor.
