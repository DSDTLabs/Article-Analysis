KENDRAPADA: The government and   (CWC) officials in the district on Tuesday rescued the three-day old infant of a tribal woman from Bhamaradiapatana village who reportedly 'sold' him to her neighbour for Rs 2,000 on Monday, and admitted both her and the child at the district headquarters hospital. 

  sold her infant on Monday to her neighbour,  , for Rs 2,000 after she delivered the baby at her home on Sunday. Mamata 'purchased' the newborn because she didn't have a son. Gita's elder son and daughter are aged 10 and 12 years. "I gave birth to the child on Sunday. My neighbour, Mamata Sahoo, who doesn't have a son, wanted to buy the baby. Since I am poor and can't make ends meet, I gave away my newborn to her for Rs 2,000," Gita told TOI on Monday. She claimed that her husband Haladhar Murmu had deserted her six months ago.
 
 "After the infant and his mother is released from the hospital, we will provide them shelter in a government-run short-stay home in Kendrapada. The authorities will also make arrangements for the admission of Gita's 12-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter in a government-managed residential school," said CWC district chairman   .
 
 "On being informed by villagers, we rushed to the village on Monday and enquired about the matter. We counselled Gita, Mamata and her husband   and tried to explain that one has no legal right to sell away her child. Mamata, however, can adopt the child under provisions of the law. But, they did not pay any heed to our advice. On Tuesday, we rescued the child with the help of the district sub-collector and admitted him and Gita at hospital," Routray said.
