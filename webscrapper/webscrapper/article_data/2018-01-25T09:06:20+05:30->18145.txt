HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad High Court on Wednesday sought to know from the state of   whether it intends to sell away half of the 640 double bedroom flats it built at   on Necklace Road, Hyderabad.

 The bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice M Ganga Rao were hearing a plea by slum dweller M Jagannadh Singh and nine other residents of the slum, who along with 280 others had to part with their slum land for the state to raise the flats as part of its double bed room flats scheme, meant to provide houses to the poor. Residents of this slum wanted an appeal against the order of a single judge who gave the green signal to the state to go ahead with construction. Advocate general D  , representing the state, stated the dwellers voluntarily gave land to the state for double bedroom scheme.
 
 Petitioners’ counsel J Prabhakar told HC that the slum dwellers gave up their possession and not the title. “The state neither acquired the land nor paid us the compensation, it simply dispossessed us with a promise of a house, he said. But now it is planning to sell away 340 flats built in our land,” he said. When asked to clarify, the   replied that the state is building 620 flats in the area. Slum dwellers will be given 280 flats and that leaves the state with a surplus of 380 flats.
 
 The bench at one stage said it would ask the state to deposit the money in a separate bank account if intends to sell them for a consideration. But later, it remanded the matter to the single judge where the slum dwellers plea was pending and directed the state to file an affidavit as to whether it has any plans to sell the remaining 340 flats for a consideration.
