CHENNAI: As if having long locks of hair fall into your eyes every so often weren't bad enough, the unhappy little pooch, distraught at finding himself in a stranger's house, vanished while trying to find his way home on January 28. An autorickshaw driver apparently abducted the dog.

 Shruthi, a resident of Mylapore, has not been able to sleep since 2-year-old Harvey, a Shih Tzu that can cost thousands of rupees in the pet market, went   after she left him with relatives in the same locality to go to Kerala on January 27.
 
 The 27-year-old senior quality analyst from a research and marketing company in Perambur hasn't been able to sleep since the adorable little dog scooted from the relative's house a day after her Shruthi left him there two Harvey.
 
 Desperate friends and relatives scored the locality and found a security camera with footage of an autorickshaw driver carrying the little dog [the breed is literally of slight built]. The registration number of the autorickshaw was not clearly visible.
 
 "He drove away with Harvey in the direction of Royapettah," Shruthi said. She has put up posts on social networking sites asking for help to locate the dog, a birthday gift from a friend last year.
 
 "Harvey became part of the family when he was six month old," Shruthi said. "He understands commands well, is obedient and adorable."
 
 She has lodged a complaint with the Royapettah police.
