AHMEDABAD: A   fell prey to fraudsters’ trick and lost her   and a mobile phone, all worth Rs 98,000. The   police have registered a case of cheating and breach of trust.

 According to a complaint filed by Satuben Shah, 66, a resident of Gitanjali Flats, IOC Road, she was passing by D Cabin bus stand at 10.30am on March 10 when a man asked her for directions. Another man soon joined in and claimed that he was kicked out of his job and had thus stolen a bundle from the office containing Rs 2.5 lakh. He showed Shah the bundle that had a Rs 500 currency note at the top.

After waiting for a long time, Shah opened the bundle and found that there was only one note atop the bundle. Her gold ornaments and the phone were gone.”
