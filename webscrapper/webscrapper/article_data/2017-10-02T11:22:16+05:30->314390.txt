TUTICORIN:   members climbed four mobile phone towers in and around Kovilpatti in   on Monday morning to protest against what they called the delay in disbursing crop insurance to   who have been affected by drought in the last two years.

 The protesters alleged that ministers and district and agriculture department officials were lying by saying they had completed disbursal of crop insurance to farmers. The DMDK cadre wanted ministers and officials to tender an unconditional apology to the farmers.
 
 Five party members climbed mobile phone towers in Kovilpatti, Kayathar, Nalattinpudur and Kalugumalai around 6.30am. 
 
 Police and district administration tried to bring them down. However, the protesters said they would not come down till the district collector gave them an assurance and tell them a date for disbursal of the insurance. 
 
 Fire and rescue services personnel were stationed near the towers.
