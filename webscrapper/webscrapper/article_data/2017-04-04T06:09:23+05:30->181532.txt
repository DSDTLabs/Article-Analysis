 Rajasthan is the only state in the country that has crossed 50% in the country. Sources claim that figures are remarkable as in 2015-16 the total growth rate was just 5.5%.
 
 According to them various factors contributed to the significant rise, both in percentage and absolute numbers.
 
 “Post demonetization people are voluntarily coming forward and paying their taxes. Also with Aadhaar getting linked to bank accounts, traceability of defaulters would be immediate. Moreover, tax payers are now aware of consequences of not paying their returns,” said an official with income tax department.
 
 There has also been substantial rise in the number of new tax payers during 2016-17. More than 1.5 lakh new assesses have been added in the Rajasthan region.
 
 Among other reasons, officials claim that there has been a surge in entrepreneurship in the state with more business activities taking place unlike in the past. Figures also swelled up because of income disclosure scheme (IDS) where Rajasthan region received about Rs 400 crore.
 
 Officials are hopeful that bracket of tax payers will only widen in years to come as more people enter into work force. Also with new checks and balances in the system, people will be left with no option but to file their returns and pay their taxes.
