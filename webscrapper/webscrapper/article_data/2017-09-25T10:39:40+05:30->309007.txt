PUNE: With the Union Public Service Commission-driven recruitment for qualified, full-time teaching faculty for its BTech course yet to be completed, the   (NDA) continues to rely on MTech qualified officers from the navy and air force to teach various subjects to the BTech cadets at the academy . At least nine naval officers and five air force officers have now joined NDA's BTech cell, following an NDA request.
Prior to this, only one officer was tasked with teaching the first-year cadets alongside teachers from BSc and BCS courses.
 
 Based on the  ' recommendation, the NDA had introduced the BTech course, with approvals from the   (AICTE) and the   University (JNU, which will be the degree-awarding institute) for its naval cadets from July 2016 and for air force cadets from January this year.
 
 Engineering cadets who complete a three-year academic and military training at the NDA will get their degrees a year later following their finishing school training at the respective officers' academy.This is to meet the four-year study requirement of an engineering degree course as laid down by the AICTE.
 
 A senior NDA officer told  , “All the new officers who have joined the BTech cell from the navy and the air force have expertise in various subjects and are also well-versed with the requirements of their respective services.These officers are not only teaching the course subjects but are also sharing their valuable experience.“
 
 The BTech has yet to be extended to the army cadets.“We have been informed that the army may give permission to induct only 30 cadets or fewer into the course. A decision to this effect is expected to come in the next few months, before beginning of the new course in March,“ the officer added.
