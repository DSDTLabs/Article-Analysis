TRICHY: Employees of state cooperative banks petitioned the district collector against the misappropriation of Rs 350crore of public money over the last five years. Staging a demo at the district collectorate, they demanded a probe into the corruption in the department.

 A large group employees of Tamil Nadu State Primary Cooperative Banks gathered in front of the district collectorâ€™s office here on Monday and raised slogans against the widespread misappropriation of public funds.
 
 In a memorandum submitted to the revenue authorities, they stated that there were 1.50 crore members across 4,500 Primary   (PACCS) functioning across the state. These banks have a collective deposit value of Rs 7,000 crore, alleged R Duraikannu, state deputy president of the association.
 
 The petition stated that there was a loss of Rs 1.5crore in the procurement of finger print scanners for common service centres functioning in PACCS. Each scanner was distributed at a price varying between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000 while the market cost was only Rs 2,500.
 
 Though the buildings that these PACCS functioned in were in a good condition, the government initiated the process of restructuring the front portion of each PACCS at an estimated cost of Rs 15,000. A total of Rs 15crore had been earmarked for this purpose, the memo stated.
 
 The empty jute bags collected from fair price shops could be sold to   for Rs 18 each. However, the officials concerned had been selling the same for Rs 8 each in the open market on commission basis. Each year, cooperative societies are losing Rs 70 crore due to corruption with the total loss over the last five years pegged at Rs 350crore.
