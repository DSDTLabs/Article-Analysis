BENGALURU: Opener   provided plenty of colour under a grey sky at the Just Cricket ground on Wednesday, hitting a blistering 90-ball-109 as Karnataka began their campaign in the   league (Group 'A') with an 85-run win over Baroda via the VJD method in a rain truncated contest.

 
 Opposition skipper   won the toss and hoped his bowlers would take advantage of the overcast conditions. However, it backfired as R  's men amassed a massive 312 for nine - perhaps 100 runs too many for Baroda. The spin duo of K Gowtham (4/
 
 42) and   (3/30) then took charge and left the opposition reeling at 180/8 in 37 overs. At that point, a spell of rain coupled with bad light ended the contest.
 
 Hooda's gambit of bowling first up appeared justified when his side snared opener   (3) cheaply. The India international attempted an upper cut, only to fashion an edge to wicketkeeper  . It was just reward for a fine start by Baroda's pacers, who made good use of the initial movement.
