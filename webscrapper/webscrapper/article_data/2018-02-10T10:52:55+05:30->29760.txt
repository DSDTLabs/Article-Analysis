PUNE: Updating Aadhaar details will become costlier by Rs5 from the next week, with the   (UIDAI) deciding to levy 18%   on its fee. 

 The present charges for updating Aadhaar is Rs25. It will go up to Rs30 after the GST is levied on it. 
 
 
  
  
 
  The UIDAI stated on its official Twitter handle that people would have to pay the GST only for updating the Aadhaar details and not for enrolment. "The GST will be levied on updating address, date of birth, gender, cellphone number, e-mail and biometric details. At present, a centre charges Rs25 for every update. The 18% GST on it would be Rs4.50. The authorities decided to round it off to Rs5 and charge people Rs30," said a senior official. 
 
  Pune district's nodal officer for Aadhaar Vikas Bhalerao said a circular on the revised fee would be issued to the agencies operating out of government offices. "The new rates will be implemented from the coming week since most of the machines are not operational at present because of a technical glitch," said Bhalerao. 
 
 The post master-general of the Pune Region,  , told TOI on Friday that post offices were updating the Aadhaar data but he had not received any circular from the district administration on levying the GST. "We will wait for the instructions," he said.
 
  activist   wondered over levying 18% GST on a regular government activity. "The government is slowly making everything a business activity. Even for RTI, they charge GST. The government should not charge citizens for these services," he said.
 
  The UIDAI has launched a toll-free helpline number to lodge complaints if any operator charges above Rs30 for updating the Aadhaar data. "Any citizen charged more than Rs30 should report the matter to the district collectorate or call the central toll free number of Aadhaar," said Bhalerao.
