CHENNAI: Despite several petitions by residents, no steps have been taken by authorities to prevent   of residential areas in  . Flooding of the area with water from   has become a repeated occurrence during every  .

 During the December 2015 floods, water from the Selaiyur Lake flooded nearby areas. Chitlapakkam was completely inundated. 
 
 “The southern stretch of Chitalapakkam gets flooded after every monsoon. This is due to overflowing of the Selaiyur Lake. Channels that are supposed to take the surfeit water to the Chitalapakkam and Sembakkam Lakes have disappeared over the years,” said P Vishwanathan, a resident.
 
 He added that the surplus water from upper catchment areas is supposed to go into the Chitlapakkam Lake and the remaining water would reach   through outflow water channels connecting Chitlapakkam and Sembakkam Lakes. “But, for the past ten years, the Chitlapakkam Lake has not been desilted and the bunds have not been strengthened,” he added.
 
 Residents said their complaint elicited a response that the public works department (PWD) had submitted a detailed project report to the Kanchipuram collector, a sanction for which is still pending.
 
 But officials from   (WRD), when contacted by TOI, denied that no projects were in the offing to improve the capacity of the Chitlapakkam Lake or channelise the flow from Selaiyur Lake. “There is no such project in the pipeline as far as I know. The lakes have a good capacity. The encroachments on the lakes cause the flooding. The PWD can’t take steps in that direction,” a senior official said.
