NEW DELHI: “What is the relation between the   and the food commissioner? There has to be a reason for refusing to remove the   even after  ,” said   Arvind Kejriwal in the   on Friday. “Let the public accounts committee of the assembly and CBI examine the ration distribution irregularities.” 

 Countering the LG Anil Baijal’s rebuttal of the   government’s white paper on the outcomes of the LG’s office, Kejriwal informed the House that he had requested the LG in March last year to replace food commissioner K R Meena following largescale complaints about corruption in ration distribution. 
 
 In its white paper, the AAP government had alleged how the LG was delaying the proposal for doorstep delivery of ration. Baijal on Thursday countered the charge with his own set of facts. While Kejriwal did not counter the LG’s arguments, he trained his guns on Meena. Despite repeated the removal plea thrice, “the LG chose to ignore it”, he said.
 
 “Today, the elected government is being questioned about ration distribution despite all its efforts to improve the state of affairs even in the wake of such non-cooperation from the LG and his appointed officers,” Kejriwal said.
 
 Food commissioner Meena was not available for comment and the LG’s office did not respond to any of the CM’s allegations.
