Chandigarh: With the ministry of human resource and development (HRD) transferring the pending budget of Rs 41 crore for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) to Chandigarh, the SSA teachers could expect their their pending   by next week. The move has come as a relief to 812 teachers and 245 other employees, who are working under SSA in Chandigarh.

 The salaries of the SSA employees have remained pending for two months. Not only this, the department also has to pay its staff around 15% salary for the month of October.
 
 In October, the UT administration had to take a loan from Chandigarh Renewal Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (CREST) to pay the salaries.
 
 Throughout the year, the SSA employees did not get their salaries on time as the ministry delayed transferring money to the UT.
 
 This would be the second installment, which was pending since November. The first installment, too, was delayed and was released in September instead of April.
