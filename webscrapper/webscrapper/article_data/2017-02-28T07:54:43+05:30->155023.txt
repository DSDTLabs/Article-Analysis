HYDERABAD: Using a debit card to buy a cup of tea and a bottle of water worth Rs 42 saved the day for Ramakanth Boora, who was travelling from the   on Saturday evening. While many shops insist on a minimum purchase of Rs 100 for card payments, stalls at the the newly-digitised station — the first on the Indian Railways — have started accepting   payments for any transaction, giving relief to thousands of travellers.

 The overall share of digital purchases at the railway station has gone from 0 to 19% within seven days of going completely digital. Digital purchases worth Rs 14,400 were made in this duration, while cash purchases were worth Rs 60,400. Passenger Reservation System (PRS) tickets worth Rs 1.38 lakh were purchased through the ‘digipay’ option compared to tickets worth Rs 4.22 lakh by cash. 
 
 While all possible services at the station are using PoS machines, most people are using ‘digipay’ for booking parcel service and buying tickets. As much as 26% of parcels and 25% of tickets were booked digitally.
 
 The South Central Railway (SCR) authorities are working on expanding theit digital network. “Digipay has been implemented to encourage cashless transactions and the usage is increasing by 3% to 4% on a daily basis since its launch on Feb 20. We will soon expand it to 10 more stations on SCR, including Secunderabad, Guntur, Tirupati and Vijayawada.” 
 
 To launch the facility, the Kacheguda authorities had a tough job convincing all the 30 vendors there to adopt  . “Authorities are having discussions with banks to provide adequate PoS machines for over 300 vendors at the other stations so that they too can go digital,” officials said.
