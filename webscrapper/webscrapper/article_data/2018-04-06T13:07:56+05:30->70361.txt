KOZHIKODE: Police and security agencies have started a probe into the recovery of an improvised explosive device (IED) near the   Temple at   near Nadapuram. The IED was found near the offering box, outside the temple on Tuesday morning. It had a capacitor, circuit, a small transformer and a switch besides a small amount of gun powder packed in a newspaper.

 Sources said the IED has been made by an expert but the intention was not known. Initial enquiry suggested that it was a low-intensity explosive and was meant to create an atmosphere of fear.   inspector   is leading the investigation team.
 
 A similar case was reported at   in 2008 where a PVC pipe with a diagram of making a bomb was recovered. The materials were found on the compound wall of a house. After preliminary investigation the police closed the case and concluded that there was no explosive among the materials. The case was reinvestigated after the busting of the terror gang led by   and E T Sainudeen in 2009. The second investigation too could not make much headway.
