BARRACKPORE: A 20-year-old youth was hit by a speeding train on Saturday morning when he was crossing the tracks in   with earphones on. He succumbed to his injuries later in the day. 

 Around 9.10am, Titagarh’s   dropped his son   near Rail Gate 14. Sankhadip had to catch a train to Kolkata, where he got a job recently after completing his hotel management course. 
 
 On way to work, Sankhadip would listen to songs on mobile phone with the earphones on. Since the gates were closed, he bent down to cross it and started walking towards the platform. But he didn’t notice that the Katwa local was approaching from behind. Sources said the driver blew horn, but he couldn’t listen. “People on platform shouted and waved hands at him. By the time he realized something was wrong and turned back it was too late,” said  , a tea seller. 
 
 The speeding train hit Sankhadip and he was flown for around eight feet before falling unconscious inside a bush. Locals took him to B N Bose sub-divisional hospital with severe head and leg injuries. Doctors referred him to   hospital. Sankhadip died on way to the city hospital.
