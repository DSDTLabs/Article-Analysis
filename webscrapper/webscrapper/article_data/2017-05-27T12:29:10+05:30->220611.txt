DEHRADUN: A day after TOI reported that surgeries at Mahatma Gandhi   (MGSEI) were being done in makeshift operation theatres near toilets, director general of health   sought a report from the chief medical officer of Dehradun,  , on the matter on Friday.
 
  Giving details, director (medical and health), Dr  , said, “The CMO has been asked to provide a full report on the situation at the hospital. He will also provide a solution for the same. A plan will be prepared for restructuring of the staff at the facility. We will also seek Rs 1 crore from the government to procure equipment for the hospital.”
  
  TOI had reported that at the premier hospital at Pritam Road in the city, the operation theatre (OT) has a toilet inside and two public lavatories adjoining it which is in complete violation of the norms of the   (MCI). Also, the OT is located in a corridor which is public space and therefore not a sterilized area as an operation theatre is required to be. Sources had told TOI that the OT was previously an administrative room that was converted into an OT by the doctors on their own “violating all the rules and playing havoc with the health of patients”.
  
  TOI had also reported that earlier this week, the hospital administration had issued a letter regarding shifting of the OT to Dr B C Ramola, senior eye surgeon associated with the hospital. The letter read: “The location of the OT on the first floor of MGSEI in the middle of the administrative block i.e. a public place, adjoining male and female toilets is not at all an ideal place to run an eye operation theatre and hence is not acceptable. More so, your OT itself is having one toilet inside which is highly objectionable and hence such an OT is not permissible.”
