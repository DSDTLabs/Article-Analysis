GUWAHATI: Defying prevailing tension,   came alive at   in upper Assam on Monday. 

 The administration   in the town in view of the festival from 11am to 3pm as people came out of their homes to celebrate Holi. The festive spirit was, however, met with a dampener as the statewide uproar over the vandalization of the Aasu office at   by Nikhil Bharat Bangali Udbastu Samannay Samiti (NBBUSS) members on March 6 continued.
 
 "We are celebrating the festival of colours, but, at the same time, feel weighed down because of the palpable tension in the area. Still, some youngsters revelled in the spirit of Holi as it is a time for colours, laughter and fun," said Pallabi Baruah, a homemaker from Silapathar.
 
 Oblivious to the political developments leading up to the event, her nephew, 12-year-old Suman soaked in the festive spirit. "I am celebrating Holi by painting the faces of my friends. Our brigade is singing Holi songs at the courtyards of our relatives," said Suman. 
 
 Yet, at the core of the events which spurred the chain of reactions lies an emotive issue. NBBUSS activists defaced the martyrs' column and the portraits of the state's cultural icons - Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla and Bhupen Hazarika at the Aasu Silapathar office.
 
 Aasu continued to assert that it will not rest until all culprits involved in the attack, including NBBUSS president Subodh Biswas is arrested.
 
 "Though Holi is being celebrated in some of the parts of Dhemaji and upper Assam, the festive spirit has been marred by the attack on the sentiments of the indigenous people. Until the perpetrators instigated the attack are nabbed, it is difficult for us to celebrate," said Chittaranjan Basumatary, a central committee member of the Aasu from Dhemaji.
 
 Apart from Holi, the Ali-Aye-Ligang celebrations of the Mishing community have also been affected by the Silapathar vandalism, that continues to draw flak from political and social organizations.
