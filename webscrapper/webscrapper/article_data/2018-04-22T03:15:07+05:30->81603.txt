MUMBAI: Ahmednagar sessions judge S U  , who on Friday imposed a   of Rs85 lakh and a jail term of 10 years on a public works department (PWD) section engineer Ashok   caught accepting a bribe of Rs1.5 lakh, has in his order explained why he slapped the highest fine and handed out the maximum sentence under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

 In his 97-page order, Judge Baghele has said, “The perusal of the records reveals that Munde had been working from July 7, 2004 to May 4, 2016, the day he was caught. Means, the accused worked on the said (sic) for a period exceeding 11 years. Looking to the factum of demanding five per cent bribe amount for every work, there is no hesitation to hold that the accused might have accepted bribe, at least to the extent of Rs10 lakh per annum, which comes to the total amount of Rs1.1 crore, during the entire tenure. The quantum of sentence of imprisonment and the quantum of amount of fine must be dependent upon and in consonance with the said factual matrix, as visible.” TOI reported on the matter on Saturday.
 
 When Munde submitted to court that it should, in view of his illness, take a lenient view and said he had to look after his old parents, Baghele said deterrence was the need of the hour and it was time for the court to take a different look at the scenario relating to corruption. “The demand and acceptance of a huge amount of bribe, coupled with the circumstances dealt with are sufficient to take a stern view against the accused,’’ the judge observed. Further, the judge said if an officer demands a bribe which is five per cent of the bill amount, the concerned contractor would make at least five per cent of the work poor in quality.
