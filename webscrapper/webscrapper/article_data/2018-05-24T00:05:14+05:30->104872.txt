Indore: Though digging of borewell is banned, district administration contemplates on giving Indore Municipal Corporation ( )   to dig 29   to fill overhead water tanks to be constructed in different areas of the city.

 In a letter written by former IMC commissioner Manish Singh on April 27, the district administrationâ€™s permission was sought for digging 29 borewells.
 
 The water tanks are being developed in Musakhedi, Tooti Press, Bhuri Tekari, Bicholi Mardana, Samar Park, Mitra Bandhu Nagar, Haroon Colony, Shri Nagar Extension, Scheme-71, Silicon City, Lasudia Mori, New Ranibagh, Triveni Udyan, Tejaji Nagar, Paliwal Nagar, Eta Bhatti, CP Shekhar Nagar (Harsiddhi), Gandhi Nagar, Gadi Adda, Tapeshwari Bagh, Kulkarni Ka Bhatta, Palsikar, Jaihind Nagar, Greater Vaishali, Suryadev Nagar, Banganga Muktidham, Tikariyabadshah village, Kushwaha Mohalla and behind Truba College.
 
 The administration is likely to give permission to IMC with some conditions, including development of a water recharge system before digging of the borewells and their water will be made available for public use.
 
 The administration has also received applications for digging 19 borewells for public use. In almost all the cases, residents of different localities have approached it to give them permission for digging a borewell for common use. The administration can give a conditional permission on their requests and a decision in this regard will be taken in a meeting led by ADM Nidhi Nivedita on May 26.
