CHENNAI: The allegations of   students of   that they were not shown the corrected answer scripts of their semester exam has brought to the spotlight a discussion among academics about a crucial issue: Re-evaluation in the university’s departments.

 Unlike affiliated colleges, students in the university’s departments cannot apply for re-evaluation if they are dissatisfied with the marks awarded. Under the current Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS) regulations, they have to sit with the concerned professors and voice their dissent after the answer scripts are made available. Many students say they feel intimidated to do so, as the professor might take offence.
 
 There is no scope currently in the university’s regulations to give the answer scripts to an external examiner, even outside the department, let alone the institute. Due to this, disputes between the students and professors, like the one that emerged in the Journalism department, turn into a deadlock.
 
 In affiliated colleges, students can pay the fee and formally approach the Controller of Exams for re-evaluation.
 
 Two Heads of Department (HoDs) said that the regulations were framed to give a certain degree of academic independence to the departments as far as syllabus, framing of question papers and evaluation is concerned. “This was done assuming that professors would be fair to students and the issues would be resolved within the department,” an HoD said. Both professors, who requested anonymity, said they were not in favour of bringing in external examiners.
 
 If there is such a necessity, the CBCS regulations can be modified to avoid victimisation of students, said retired professor and former HoD of Library science A Amudavalli. “Bringing in an external examiner will mean that the evaluation is not left only to the department professors,” the former syndicate member said.
