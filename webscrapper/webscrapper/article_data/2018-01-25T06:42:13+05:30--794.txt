KOLKATA: Chief minister   urged local clubs and its members to look after senior citizens in their locality and also act as para watchdog. The CM said this during a programme at Netaji Indoor Stadium on Wednesday.

 Mamata also advised them to undertake multifarious activities from planting saplings to development of the locality. “Club members should also come forward if someone misbehaves with a woman in the locality,” the CM said.
 
 She narrated her experience of  , where she grew up. “I don’t feel alone after my mother’s death. Some elderly women in the locality wait to wave at me while I pass by in the morning. I would urge you to create such environment in localities and even in housing societies,” she added.
