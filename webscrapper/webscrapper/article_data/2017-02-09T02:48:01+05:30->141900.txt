NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court directed the   government on Wednesday to pay compensation of Rs 60 lakh to each of the 681 families which were affected by the Sardar Sarover Project but were not properly compensated for the loss of their land and habitation. 

  A bench of Chief Justice   and Justices N V Ramana and D Y   asked the state to pay the amount before the   which was set up to examine the plea of all those affected. It asked the authority to disburse the amount within two months. 
 
 The SC passed the order on a plea by the   (NBA) which contended that many affected families had not been paid any compensation despite various SC orders. 
 
  Advocate Sanjay Parekh, appearing for NBA, said that 368 out of the 681 families had received only the first instalment of the compensation and couldn't get the second one. He also pointed out that there were 124 families which did not get anything and the 171 that had opted for land had not been compensated yet. 
 
  The bench thereafter directed the state to settle the matter in two months and also directed the affected families to vacate the submerged area by July-end. The NBA also contended that there were 1,385 families which were "duped" by authorities by denying them their due. Accepting its plea, the court directed the state to pay Rs 15 lakh to those families after deducting the amount already paid.
