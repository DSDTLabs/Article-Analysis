NEW DELHI. Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken yesterday said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) thrashed a senior civil servant to help the BJP “shift focus away from Nirav Modi”, who allegedly cheated a bank of crores of rupees.

 Maken said that “thrashing chief secretary (CS) of Delhi”, Anshu Prakash, was a strategy by AAP lawmakers to help the BJP, which is under opposition fire for allegedly looking the other way while the defrauding was happening.
 
 The Congress leader tried to substantiate his claims of a tacit understanding between the BJP and AAP by sharing advertisement posters of both parties that feature the same set of supporters.
 
  
  
 Earlier yesterday, Prakash, the Delhi CS, alleged he was manhandled by AAP lawmakers in the presence of party chief and Delhi CM   at his residence on Monday night.
 
 Demanding strict action against hooligan tactics, Maken sought an apology from Kejriwal.
 
  
  
 “Delhiites are paying for the misgovernance of AAP. Kejriwal should take strict legal as well as disciplinary action against his erring MLAs. If he fails to do so, he has no right to continue as CM of Delhi,” said Maken.
 
 Echoing Maken’s sentiments, BJP spokeswoman Shazia Ilmi condemned the alleged attack by AAP lawmakers and demanded the party be renamed ‘Aam Gunda Party’.
 
  
  
 "AAP is so shrewd that even after beating CS, their gundas are falsely accusing him of using casteist slurs against dalits. How incredibly cunning!" Ilmi tweeted.
