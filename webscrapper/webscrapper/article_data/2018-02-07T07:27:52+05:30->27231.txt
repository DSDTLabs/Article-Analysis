BENGALURU: Rajya Sabha member   Chandrasekhar on Tuesday claimed that he and his social media team were getting threat calls from what he called “chief minister Siddaramaiah-inspired goons”, adding that a complaint has been lodged with   police.

 Chandrasekhar said he had predicted some weeks ago that the upcoming assembly polls would see some desperate tactics from the government, including lies, insults, threats and divisive politics. “This has proved true with the diatribe against Prime Minister  . The   seems to have added intimidation to this basket of dirty tactics,” he said and alleged that the “steel flyover minister” had threatened to teach him a lesson and now some hoodlums threatened his team members outside their workplace. 
 
 According to the complaint, his team member, who had left the office on Midford Road between 6.40pm and 7pm on Monday, was walking towards the   station when two persons approached him and asked: “Rajeev ke liye kaam karta hai kya? (Do you work for Rajeev?)”
 
 Initially, he ignored them and when they repeated the question, he replied in the affirmative. “Digital marketing dekhta hain na, zyada ud mat, thand rakh (you look after digital marketing right? Don’t act smart, keep calm),” they said.
 
 They reportedly told him that since he lives in Whitefield where a lot of vehicles ply, one can also run over him. “We’ve formed a special team to probe the matter. We’ll collect CCTV footages from the surrounding areas and trace the accused,” a police officer said.
