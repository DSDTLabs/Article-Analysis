BENGALURU: With the JD(S) possibly holding the cards as dramatic developments unfolded in Karnataka, both Prime Minister   and   president   wished the party's supremo HD Deve   on his birthday.

 
 "Spoke to our former Prime Minister Shri HD   Ji and conveyed birthday wishes to him. I pray for his good health and long life," Modi tweeted this morning.
 
  
  
 Gowda, who served as prime minister from June 1, 1996 to April 21, 1997, turned 85 today
 
 A day earlier,   Gandhi on Thursday, sought to strengthen ties with the JD(S), calling up Deve Gowda. Rahul reportedly apologized to the former Prime Minister for making personal attacks against him and his party during the poll campaign. At a rally in Mandya, Rahul had dubbed JD(S) as the BJP’s ‘B’ Team and later called it Janata Dal (Sangh Parivar).
 
 Party sources said the conversation between the two leaders lasted for 10 minutes and dwelled on the current situation in Karnataka and how they need to take it forward. “The duo decided to stay united and fight for a common cause in Karnataka,’’ said a source.
 
 Rahul enquired about Gowda’s health and wished the octogenarian in advance as he celebrates his 85th birthday on Friday. Gowda visited Tirumala temple to offer prayers on Thursday.
 
 The Congress president sought the former PM’s cooperation in taking on Narendra Modi in Karnataka and also across the country in the 2019 elections.
 
 Rahul’s apology and personal call should be seen in the context of Congress and JD(S) having fought a bitter poll campaign wherein the two traded jibes constantly, but quickly joined hands to thwart   after results came in.
