BIHARSHARIF: Nalanda police heaved a sigh of relief with the arrest of a top Maoist activist by Ranchi police on Monday.

 Ganesh Shankar alias  , a resident of Chiksohra village under the same police station area in Hilsa block of Nalanda district and a self-styled commander of People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI), has over 12 criminal cases of heinous nature registered against him with different police stations in Nalanda, Bakhtiarpur in Patna district and Barhi in the neighbouring Jharkhand. 
 
 Nalanda SP Kumar Ashish said Ganesh, son of one Nageshar Mistri, wanted in connection with murders of a Jharkhand businessman and a Hilsa resident.
 
 The SP said Ganesh was wanted in several other murder, extortion, dacoity and loot cases in Bihar and the neighbouring Jharkhand. “Police officers have already left for Ranchi to cooperate with Jharkhand police in the investigation,” the SP added.
