BENGALURU: The 28-year-old swimming coach, who was kidnapped by two car-borne men in full public view on   on Sunday night, had valiantly resisted her abductors' attempts to sexually assault her and jumped out of the moving vehicle, Bellandur police said, quoting from her statement. 

  Based on her statement made on Wednesday, police booked a case under IPC sections 354A ( ) and 342 ( ). Earlier, they had booked a kidnap case against the attackers who are still at large. 
 
 "After coming out of a medical shop in front of the Confident Phoenix Apartment, I was walking on the left side of the road when a   stopped near me and the man sitting in the rear pulled me in. After driving for a little distance, they stopped at a desolate place and tried to misbehave with me. I shouted and attacked them. The driver again started the vehicle and I kicked both of them, opened the door and jumped out of the moving car. We hadn't gone too far from the place where I was abducted. I walked back and reached the residence of my uncle, who is a doctor. After being treated by him, I returned home," she said in the statement.
 
 Police said the car registration number was not clear in the   footage. "It is definitely a Tamil Nadu vehicle. We have contacted TN police and other officials, seeking more details. We will nab the miscreants soon," police said.
 
 Passersby who had witnessed the abduction had tipped off police, and close to 7,000 messages were circulated among local residents in an effort to locate the car.
