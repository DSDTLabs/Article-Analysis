MANGALURU: Summer holidays at   in Kudla will be more fun-filled and entertaining this time, thanks to ‘Rent A Sports’ concept introduced at the beach.

  (PBTDP) in association with Rai Sport & Rentals, has introduced the new concept ‘Rent A Sport’, where in visitors and tourists can avail sports equipment  . Beach cycle, beach tent, tug of war, cricket set, volley ball, throw ball, football, lagori, frisbee/ flying disc, angling and ring toss are available for tourists for rent.
 
 Yathish Baikampady, CEO of PBTDP, told TOI that the new initiative, launched to boost the beach tourism, has been receiving a very good response from the people. “Those, who visit the beach on holidays in groups, can avail these sports equipment on rent. The initiative will be convenient for corporate companies and institutions, which plan picnic to the beach,” Yathish said.
 
 Yatish said the idea of starting this initiative was conceptualized after many visitors at the beach started enquiring about the availability of volleyball and other sport equipment. The footfall to the beach is expected to increase soon after the completion of all public examinations, he added.
 
 “The beach witnesses an average footfall of 20,000 visitors on Saturdays and Sundays. On weekdays, an average of 2,000 – 5,000 visitors arrive on the beach and during the summer holidays, the number of tourists crosses 40,000 per day. At present, the flow of tourists is less due to exams, but it will increase in a week or two,” Yathish said.
 
 He said the team of lifeguards at the beach have been trained and affiliated with the Royal Life Saving Society, International Life Saving, and Surf Life Saving Australia. PBTDP has also been promoting several beach activities including AT buggy, camel ride, horse ride, para-sailing, water scooter, surfing, water sports like jet-ski rides, boating, dolphin viewing, food stalls and several other entertainments.
