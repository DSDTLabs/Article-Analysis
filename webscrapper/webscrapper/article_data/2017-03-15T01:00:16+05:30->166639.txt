NAWADA: Several persons were injured in a clash between members of two communities in the communally sensitive Baghibagdiha village, around six km from Warisaliganj police station, on Tuesday. Nawada DM, SP, civil SDO and SDPO have rushed to the site with additional forces to control the situation.   Police sources said people from one community objected to the passing of the traditional “jhumta” procession of the other community on the occasion of Holi on Monday. The blocking of the road to prevent passing of the procession led to heavy stone pelting from both sides. However, before the situation could worsen further, a fragile truce between the two communities was brokered in the evening by SDPO Ram Pukar Singh.    However, some unidentified miscreants later in the night set ablaze the paddy hay-stock of villager Balak Yadav, leading to second round of stone pelting on Tuesday, in which several persons from both sides were injured. Nawada DM Manoj Kumar and SP Vikash Burman have rushed to the site to restore peace. The situation is under control now,” said a police officer.
