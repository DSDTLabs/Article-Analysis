NOIDA: A 26-year-old pregnant woman who was turned back by the district   in the absence of a doctor on Tuesday morning, delivered a baby boy in a car later in the afternoon. Both the mother and the baby are doing fine.

 Babita, who had a premature delivery around 1.30 pm on Tuesday, had been taken to the hospital around 6.30am by her relatives but was asked to go elsewhere as there was no doctor available.
 
 A resident of Azadpur in Delhi, Babita was staying at her sister’s place in Sector 36 from where she was taken to the district hospital by her sister Sangeeta and cousin Gautam.
 
 Her family members, however, did not take her to any other place, anticipating that private hospitals would charge hefty fees.
 
 “My daughter started getting labour pain early on Tuesday and we took her to the district hospital. The emergency staff asked us to get her checked by a doctor before admitting her to the hospital,” Babita’s mother Chandra Devi told TOI.
 
 However, she said that when they checked, they found that there was no doctor present in the emergency ward and “hence we left for home”.
 
 “When I came back, my pain escalated further and my sister informed her employer, Dr Alba. The doctor arrived in their home in Sector 36 and drove them to the district hospital. However, I delivered my baby in her car around 1.30pm when the vehicle had reached the Nithari cut, around 200 metres from the hospital,” Babita said.
 
 Chief medical superintendent (CMS)   said that he will check whether the emergency doctor on duty was present in the hospital around the said time when the patient arrived.
 
 “It should not be the case as an emergency doctor is present in the hospital at all times. However, we will inquire into the allegations,” Agrawal said.
