GORAKHPUR: UP CM Aditya Nath Yogi on Saturday said no action would be taken against slaughterhouses which are being run on valid licences.

 Speaking at a function in his Lok Sabha constituency, Gorakhpur, for the first time after becoming the chief minister, he said his government was just following the orders of   (NGT) in this regard. “NGT has been asking for dealing with unhygienic conditions and filth in the state. Those butcher houses that are illegal and spread filth on roads and pollution in the environment will be closed,“ he said.
 
 Yogi said his government will ensure welfare of every citizen of the state without discrimination in the name of caste, group, religion or gender. “Sabka vikas hoga, lekin tushtikaran kisi ki nahin hogi (Development of all, but appeasement of none,“ he said in his address which started with the slogan of `Vande Matram' and ended with `Jai Sri Ram'.
 
 On the `anti-Romeo squads' set up by his government, he said: “After becoming CM, a large number of mothers and sisters called me and I gave them an assurance of safety and security. Any girl can walk safely on road even late in the night... we have to ensure this in the state. I have openly said that no action will be taken in case couples are sitting or moving around at public places with mutual understanding. But those who irritate girls and women and harass them won't be spared.“ The CM clarified that no new rules were being made. “We are only implementing the promises of election manifesto,“ he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, the state government doubled the financial grant for residents of UP going to Kailash Mansarovar yatra from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh. “I want to give a good news to you all, that those who are healthy and want to visit Kailash Mansarovar will get Rs 1 lakh,“ Yogi announced in Gorakhpur.
