MUMBAI: At least 100 residents gathered at   on Thursday evening to put forth suggestions to the   to maintain the park. The residents were upset as the   recently took over the open space. They are worried as they feel the BMC may not be able to maintain it in a befitting manner.

 On Wednesday, locals who visited   found it taken over by the BMC. The 16,600sqm park was being maintained by a private trust under the BMC's adoption policy.
 
 Activist Shyama Kulkarni said a signature campaign has begun and residents plan to submit their grievances to the authorities. “We are afraid the park may lose its beauty if it's poorly maintained,“ said Kulkarni.
 
 An official from BMC's garden department said citizens' concerns were heard and they have asked them to submit a document stating their grievances. “We will put these before the higher authorities. Currently, there is no provision to allow any private trust to maintain an open space and we're already in the process of taking them back,“ said the official.
