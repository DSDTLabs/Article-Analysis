PUNE: Taking a united stand, Nationalist   ( ), Congress, and Shiv Sena have opposed doubling of water tax proposed by Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation.

 While the proposal was approved by the standing committee last week, it will be discussed at the civic general body meeting on Tuesday.
 
 NCP activists staged demonstrations at eight zonal offices on Monday and submitted signatures of over 12,000 water tax consumers. “Over the past 15 years, NCP has implemented minimum taxes and carried out maximum development work. The BJP is increasing taxes of citizens,” NCP city unit president Sanjog Waghere Patil said. 
 
  party leader   said that proposal had been approved for doubling of water tax from the current 4% and 5% for residential and commercial users to 8% and 10% respectively.
