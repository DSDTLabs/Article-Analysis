MUMBAI: Fifteen-car services on the slow corridor will soon become a reality as   has floated tenders to appoint a contractor to extend length of platforms between Andheri and Virar stations.

 As of now,   services ply only on the fast corridor of CR and WR. On the slow corridor, WR runs only 12-car services as some stations do no have platforms that are long enough for 15-car rakes.
 
 “The work is estimated to cost around Rs 24 crore and will be completed within two years from the day the bids are finalized,” a WR official said. The project received a sanction in the   on February 1.
 
 A WR official said, “There is a lot of rush between Andheri and Virar. Longer trains will increase the carrying capacity of each rake by 25%.” WR runs 42 15-car services on the fast corridor and none of them halt at stations between Mumbai Central and Churchgate for want of adequate platform length.
 
 “Beyond Andheri, it will not be possible to run 15-car services as there is no space to increase the length of platforms. For instance: The length of platforms cannot be increased at any station between Mumbai Central and Churchgate,” added the official. 
 
 If 15-car services run beyond Andheri, WR will have to provide double halts, which will affect punctuality of trains. 
 
 “It does not make sense to put in service only 15-car rakes. But injustice will not be done to those travelling south of Andheri. As the project will take some years to materialize, by then, we will be able to make substantial progress on the sixth line between   (phase I). This will open up path to run additional services.”
