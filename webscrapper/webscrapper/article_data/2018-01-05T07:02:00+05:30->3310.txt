GURUGRAM: The government’s decision to shift the Kherki-Daula   on NH8 to Sehrawan has brought cheer to the villagers, who hope the move will bring development to the area.

 Suman Devi, the sarpanch of Sehrawan, said: “We had been waiting for the toll plaza to be built here. Around 5 acres had been taken from this village for it. We are happy with the compensation we are supposed to get for our land.”
 
 “The only people who are not happy with the move are those from the gram panchayat of  , where the toll plaza was situated earlier,” she added.
 
 Of the total 65 acres required for the new toll plaza to come up, 5 acres are in Sehrawan and the remaining land is spread across nearby villages in Manesar. 
 
 Sehrawan is home to around 700 people, many of whom are in the army or have opened their transport business.
 
 The villagers hope that with the shifting of the toll plaza, the otherwise deserted area would be brimming with activity.
 
 “Leave aside girls, even boys don’t dare go out after dark in this village. It’s dangerous, as there are no street lights or proper roads here. We live along NH8 and we fear being targeted by robbers. Even the nearest police station is 8km away in Manesar. The toll plaza will bring some relief,” said Sunita Devi, another villager.
 
 Abhay Singh, another resident of Sehrawan, said “We will request NHAI to give jobs to our children as the opportunities here are scarce.”
 
 “The plan, as far as we know, is to make the new toll plaza big and wide so that there are no traffic jams. It will be much wider than the Kherki-Daula toll,” he added.
