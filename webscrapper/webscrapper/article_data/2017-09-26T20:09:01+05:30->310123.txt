 While Salman allegedly slapped Nadeem on Monday afternoon after some altercation, he accosted him later to take revenge.
  
 Police said, according to Nadeem the bullet scrapped his right shoulder and then the suspects tried to stab him in which his right palm got injured. They reportedly fled when some residents raised an alarm.
  
 Talking to TOI, University Proctor Prof Mohsin Khan said that Arham completed his Masters in Tourism Administration this year only. But Salman's record is being verified whether he was an AMU student or not. He said, the university canâ€™t take any action against any of them as they are no longer studying there.
