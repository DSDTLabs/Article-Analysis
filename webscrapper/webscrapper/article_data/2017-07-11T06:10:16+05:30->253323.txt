HYDERABAD: A housewife, walking on the road, was robbed of her three-tola gold chain by unidentified miscreants at Upperpally,   on Monday morning. Ironically, the incident happened in the area where the robbers who made a vain bid at   at Mylardevpally, abandoned their getaway vehicle Tavera. 

 Rajendranagar police said  , who stays near pillar number 204 of PVNR Expressway, left her residence around 7 am to run an errand. At 7.10 am, three persons, travelling on a bike, came from the rear, brandished a knife and threatened her to give them her chain. Fearing for her life, she handed over her chain to the trio. 
 
 Sabera recalled that the trio came from the opposite direction, crossed her and a little distance away took a U-turn and came near her with the knife. "They threatened and ordered me to give them the chain. Fearing for my life, I handed over my three-tola chain. Later, I yelled for help, but it was of little use as no one came to my rescue,'' she added.
 
 Sabera approached police and lodged a complaint. Based on her complaint, Rajendranagar police registered a robbery case. When contacted, Rajendranagar police said there were no CCTV cameras at the location where the incident happened. "The trio were wearing surgical masks to hide their faces,'' Rajendranagar inspector Umender said. Police were tying to look for CCTV footage from nearby areas to get leads to nab the culprits. 
 
 It appears that the miscreants were waiting for an opportunity to target a lonely woman and steal valuables. Some gangs were operating on the highway too. Some incidents in which passers-by were stopped and their valuables, including gold ornaments, were stolen were reported from the area.
