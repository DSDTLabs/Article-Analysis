AHMEDABAD: “Let us imagine a true museum, one that contained everything, one that could present a complete picture after the passage of time, after the destruction by time…” This is the   Le Corbusier, the master architect, had envisioned in 1939.   ( ), his dream project, was finally realized in Ahmedabad in 1954.

 Le Corbusier had imagined a museum which had a series of galleries elevated on pilotis (pillars) and organized about a square courtyard that was to extend infinitely. The design of the Museum of Unlimited Growth was Le Corbusier’s counter-narrative to the typical museum which was built as a monument.
 
 Le Corbusier’s museum was based on broad themes of being “order-less, face-less, place-less, end-less,” according to aresearch scholar I Chin of the Harvard Graduate School of Design. “The pilotis (pillars) serve more of a symbolic purpose,” Chin has written. “By lifting the building from the earth, Le Corbusier removes the institution from its historical and cultural context. Placeless, the Museum of Unlimited Growth is unbound, to a nation or a state, being of no-where and every-where.”
 
 If Le Corbusier’s original design for the   had been fully realized, the roof terrace would have become a garden for Ahmedabad! It would have spread across half an acre, fountains would have radiated a cooling mist, and flowers would have run a riot of colours. In “The Complete Works 1910-65” of  , compiled by W Boesiger, Le Corbusier says: “It is assumed that a visit to the museum will be made particularly in the evening and at night-time; they will wind up on the roof which will offer a wonderfully flowered surface formed by more than 45 basins, of 50 square metres each, all filled with water to a depth of 40 cm.”
