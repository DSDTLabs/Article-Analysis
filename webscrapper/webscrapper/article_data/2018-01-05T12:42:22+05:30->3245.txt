A new law in   is requiring all companies to prove that their wage practices don’t discriminate against women, in what is thought to be a global first in the effort to reduce gender pay gaps.

 The law, which was passed with a large majority by parliament in June, took effect at the New Year. It seeks to erase a current pay gap between men and women of about 5.7%.
 
 
 
 While other nations, and the US state of  , have equal-salary certificate policies, Iceland is believed to be the first to make it mandatory for both private and public firms. The   nation, which has a population of about 3,30,000, wants to eradicate the gender pay gap by 2022. The country has a female prime minister,  , and ranks first on the World Economic Forum’s global gender equality index.
 
 Companies with more than 25 workers will have to obtain an “equal pay certification'” from an accredited auditor showing that they are basing pay differences on legitimate factors such as education, skills and performance. Big companies with more than 250 employees have until the end of the year to get the certification, while the smallest have until the end of 2021. The certification must be renewed every three years.
 
 Equal rights researchers said they hoped Iceland’s legislation would encourage others to follow suit in tackling the gender pay gap while also highlighting the need to address the lack of women politicians globally.
