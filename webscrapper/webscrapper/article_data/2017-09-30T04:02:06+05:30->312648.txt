Mumbai: While large commuter crowds lead to congestion on most railway foot overbridges (FOB) here, what adds to the mess is the presence of many   on them and along the path to stations. In the case of the Elphinstone FOB too, hawkers make a beeline both on the east and west of the railway station and the bridge connecting Parel and Elphinstone. 

  said the main reason for hawkers flocking around railway stations is the large concentration of   moving in and out. “Most office-goers have no time to visit the market, and therefore purchase items from hawkers, which encourages them to operate from these areas. It’s a case of supply going where there is demand,” said activist Rajkumar Sharma from Chembur, where too hawkers clog entry/exit points. 
 
 The activists said that whenever they tried pointing out the rise in hawkers to the authorities, they are told to refrain from purchasing items from the hawkers, which will automatically make them leave the area. “But are not the authorities turning a blind eye when they are bound to take action against these hawkers for illegally occupying space? Besides, not all commuters purchase wares from them. This problem persists at all railway stations and in time of a calamity, like what happened on Friday, it can only make things worse,” said G R Vora, a Sion-based activist. 
 
 A few years back, BMC had in a special drive cleared hawkers who operated on the east side of Parel station and west side near the Elphinstone exit. But the hawkers returned in around two months. Civic officials said many hawkers have political patronage, which makes it difficult to take consistent action against them. 
 
 Nayana Kathpalia, an activist and NAGAR trustee, said there is scant value for life in Mumbai. “Bridges and subways are purely pedestrian spaces and therefore should be kept free of encroachments. Such incidents are bound to happen when there is over-crowding,” said Kathpalia.
