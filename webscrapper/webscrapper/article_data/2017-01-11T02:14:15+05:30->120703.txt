GURGAON: Commuters facing hardships driving on city roads will have to bear them for one more year. MCG authorities said the   repair work will take one-and-a-half months more to start and it will take at least a year to make all stretches in the city motorable. Officials said the reason for the delay in starting the road   work is because they wanted to allot the Rs 100-crore contract to a single agency for effective monitoring.

 A senior official from MCG’s engineering department told TOI on Tuesday the road repair work is likely to begin by February-end. “ The contract has now been given, but the paperwork is still on and it will take about 20 more days before we can give the private agency the ‘letter to proceed’ ,” he said.
 
 “Moreover, we will not be able to lay bitumen on roads before February-end due to the prevailing   conditions. In all, 33 roads in the city will have to be repaired and the time given to the agency is 12 months to finish its task,” the official added.
 
 However, residents say they are fed up with MCG’s false promises.
 
 “Since our sector was officially transferred to MCG from Huda in May 2016, not even one paisa worth of development or maintenance activities have been carried out. The joint commissioner, who is in-charge of engineering works, kept giving us false assurances that roads will be repaired on priority by December last year, but nothing has happened so far on the ground,” said  , general secretary of Sector 23A RWA.
 
 Despite several attempts, MCG commissioner   could not be contacted.
