GURUGRAM: An unidentified person has been booked for   the   account of a woman and deleting important data. 

 Police are yet to identify the accused but have found out that the account was hacked in Panchkula. 
 
 According to police, the woman is a resident of Prem Nagar colony and works with a private firm. 
 
 A few days ago, she lodged a complaint with the police, saying that someone had deleted important data after hacking her Gmail account.
 
 According to the woman’s complaint, she has a Gmail account and also uses WhatsApp on her mobile phone. 
 
 She had chosen Google Cloud to save her online data, including pictures and messages. In October last year, she found out that most of her data saved on Google Cloud had been deleted. 
 
 Even the WhatsApp messages were missing. She realised that her Gmail account had been hacked and moved the police.
 
 The case was assigned to the cyber crime cell and its investigators found out that the Gmail account of the woman was hacked by a man in Panchkula and recommended an FIR. 
 
 An FIR was then registered on Thursday at Sector 14 police station against the accused under Section 66 of Information Technology Act. 
 
 “We have registered the case and are trying to nab the accused with the help of the cyber crime cell. The accused will be arrested soon,” said inspector Bhartender, SHO, Sector 14 police station.
