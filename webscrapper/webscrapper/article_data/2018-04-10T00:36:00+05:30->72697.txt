Pune: Citizens continue to use the banned plastic items following an extension in the deadline to dispose them of and in the absence of an immediate alternative.  The state government recently extended the April 24 deadline to dump the banned plastic goods to June 23 to facilitate the transition process. Following this, not many people are coming forward to deposit their plastic items with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).  Suresh Jagtap, head of the PMC’s solid waste management department, said, “We have made an arrangement so that people can deposit their plastic items in the respective ward offices. They can also contact the sanitary inspectors in the respective wards for this. However, the citizens’ response has been very low so far.” The civic authorities have started seizing plastic items from commercial establishments across the city. Jagtap said, “We have so far seized 20 tonnes of plastic items from the commercial establishments and the drive will continue. All these items be processed at our plastic recycling units. Citizens should avoid using plastic”  Rudra Environmental Solutions, a private organisation dealing in recycling of plastics, stated that it has received a good response in terms of collection of plastic. “Our collection of plastics has increased following the ban. On April 8 alone, we received three-and-a-half tonne of banned plastic from Mumbai,” Rudra Environmental Solutions director Medha Tadpatrikar said.  “One thing is for certain that people have started talking about the issue. We get numerous enquiries every day — about the ban, penalties if one is found possessing plastic, what happens to the plastic collected and others,” she said.  “We have handed over 22 tonnes of plastic to the Pune Municipal Corporation for constructing roads and will hand over another 28 tonnes in near future. People must know the utility of plastic and how it is recycled, so that they can come forward to deposit it,” Tadpatrikar said.
