JAIPUR: The Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JRMC) will develop an underground   for 150 cars at   metro station in the  . 

 This will be the first underground parking that will be developed under the Metro phase I (B) project in the heritage Walled City.
 
 According to JMRC officials, the parking will be developed on the reversal line between Badi Chaupar and Ramganj area. 
 
 As the reversal line will be constructed using cut-and-cover method, the JMRC has decided not to fill the trench and develop parking and shops in the space. “We have proposed to dig 300 metre (long) and 20 metre (wide) trench between Badi Chaupar and Ramganj. It is proposed to construct a two-level structure which could be used for constructing parking and shops instead of filling the trench with mud again.”
 
 The JMRC estimates to develop parking and shops in 6,000 square metre area. While parking will be developed on second level, shops will be on the first level. “As per the standard rule in one acre (4046.86 sq. metre) parking for 100-115 cars can be developed. Parking space for nearly 170 cars will be developed according to the estimation,” said an official. 
 
 The JMRC has started an exercise to determine the cost of the project. Officials believe, the estimated construction cost of the project will be approximately Rs 15 crore.
 
 “The state government has given in-principal approval for construction of market and retail shops. We are working to estimate the cost of the project,” added official 
 
 It is expected to be completed in 2018 which will resolve the parking problem in the Walled City to a bit. The   (JSML) and JMRC are jointly expected to take up this project.
 
 "The JSML will also contribute in this project. However, any concrete decision about the construction of the project will be taken at the higher level.”
