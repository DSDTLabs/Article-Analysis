NEW DELHI: ‘Freedom of Speech and Expression: Under Constitution of India’, a seminar that was to be held on March 4 at  , was cancelled by the dean for “not following the proper procedure”. On Friday, it was organised by the students with the same set of speakers, including BJP MP  , in protest against the “curtailment of freedom of speech and expression”. 

 “We should be wary of the attempts to divide India,” said Swamy. The Indian society has always been tolerant and debate has always been an integral part of it, he added. “We don’t need people to teach us that.” However, taking a jibe at JNU students, he said, “They incited stone pelters and separatists on February 9.” This, he said, is not freedom of speech.
 
 In the inaugural speech, dean of Law Faculty Ved Kumari said, “If women ask for their rights and freedom from patriarchy, they shouldn’t be called anti-nationals.” She also said the universities should allow spaces for academic discussions on dissent.
 
 The former chief justice of the Patna high court, Iqbal Ahmed Ansari, said sedition was an intensely debatable subject. “Laws are norms set by governments and they don’t remain static.” Raising the Ramjas issue, Supreme Court advocate Monika Arora questioned “the teachers who invited an accused out on bail to a seminar”. The organisers alleged that the seminar was cancelled as the dean disapproved of the speakers. However, Kumari said she never permitted the programme.
