AKTU, to which the institutes are affiliated, had issued a notification last year saying these students had already paid the seventh semester fees (about Rs 70,000), they would be required to pay the eighth semester fee only.
 
 However, on Monday evening, they received a notice from the college which showed that AKTU had allowed them to collect fees for “odd semester” from third year and final year students transferred from JRE to Skyline. Later in the evening, AKTU released a fresh notification saying the previous one had an error and it should have been “even semester”.
