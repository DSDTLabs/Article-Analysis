GORAKHPUR: Krishna Verma (9), one of the four students in the van to survive, said that the children saw the train was speeding towards them and shouted to the driver to stop the vehicle but he didn't respond. 

 "We were shouting and asking driver uncle to stop but he didn't as he was busy talking on his phone and was not able to listen to us," said Krishna, a class III student, who sustained injury in his leg. 
 
 "Driver uncle went very close to the train. When I gained consciousness, I was sitting among others who were lying on the ground and not moving."
 
 "Somebody took me to a hospital and then I was taken to another hospital," said a visibly-shocked Krishna whose 10-year-old sister Roshni was also injured in the accident and is currently undergoing treatment at BRD Medical College where her condition is said to be critical. Krishna's father Kailash, a mason by profession, said, "While I am thankful to God that my son is safe my daughter is still in a critical state. My wife is in shock and is fainting frequently." 
 
 BRD Medical College principal Dr Ganesh Kumar said that Krishna is out of danger but three other children are in critical condition because they sustained head injuries. 
 
 "The van driver has multiple fractures and has head injuries also. His condition is very critical," added Dr Kumar.
