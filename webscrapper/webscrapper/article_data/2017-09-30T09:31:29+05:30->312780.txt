CHANDIGARH: The apathy of local authorities has imposed an additional pressure on the pockets of Sector 25 residents in Panchkula. After several complaints to the authorities, the residents, who were struggling with issues like   menace, wild growth and snakes hiding there, have now hired people to clear the mess around their houses.

 Monkeys are a regular visitor to the Sector 25 residential colony. The residents claimed that there have been several cases where the monkeys broke window panes of their houses and lids of the overhead tanks. 
 
 Rahul Gosain, a resident of Sector 25, said, “The biggest damage the monkeys caused recently was when they broke the solar panels installed on my roof. Even if it is damaged slightly, I have to pay a huge amount to the repairing guy. It has happened twice with me.”
 
 The house owners have now pooled in their resources to hire the man who would produce sounds of lion-tailed monkey (langur) on a salary of Rs 8,000 a month.
 
 Wild growth around the area is the other issue bothering the residents of the place. Public parks are in a mess as grasses have grown into bushes.   is also being dumped there due to lack of maintenance.
 
 The residents, now, have also hired a man at a salary of Rs 12,000 per month and fixed his responsibilities to clear the wild growth around their houses. Pallavi, a resident, said, “Grasses should at least be trimmed regularly so that children can play and people can visit the parks.” 
 
 The bushes have also become a hideout for snakes and other insects, which sneaks inside the houses. For this, a snake wrangler has also been put on job at a salary of Rs 8000 a month to catch snakes hiding in the bushes.
 
 Hemant Sirin, an advocate and a resident, said, “Snakes have managed to sneak into my house three times.”
