NAGPUR: After March 24, all   (NU) exams scheduled for May 9 and 10 have been postponed in view of the MH-CET for engineering, BPharm and BSc (Agriculture) to be held across the state. 

 Though the MH-CET would be held on May 10, the colleges would be taken over a day before by the DTE officials. 
 
 The March 24 exams were postponed after they clashed with NU’s 105 convocation. After this reshuffle, the NU was not willing to further change dates of any other exam as it would be affecting the students’ plans.
 
  (DTE) wrote to NU asking that it would need most of colleges as exam centres where NU exam are scheduled. Around 40 colleges would be the centres for the three MH-CETs. 
 
 While the new dates for March 24 exams are yet to be finalized, the May 9 and 10 exams would be held either on May 15 or 16. The Semester II, IV, VI and VIII of engineering and a couple of other courses would be affected.
 
 Director, Board of Examinations and Evaluation   said mostly engineering exams need to be re-scheduled. “For the exams yet to be scheduled, we are skipping the two days — May 9 and 10 — so there won’t be more changes. All engineering exams would be over by May 14 so the affected exams can be conducted soon after the last paper,” he said.
 
 Khaty added that the centres would be taken over by the district collectorate a day before on May 9 for security reasons. 
 
 Joint director of technical education   said the date to hold the exam is decided by State Common Entrance Test (CET) cell Mumbai. “Last time too some exams were postponed since the centres are required a day before the exam to make seating arrangements. This time the university had announced its exam schedule well in advance so a request letter was sent and they agreed to shift the dates,” he said.
