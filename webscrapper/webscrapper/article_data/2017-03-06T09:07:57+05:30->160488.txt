PUNE:   and another sustained severe injuries after a truck they were travelling by swerved off the road and fell into a gorge in   near Kondhwa at 11.15am on Sunday.

 The Pune fire brigade personnel and local people pulled out the three men who were stuck in the truck’s cabin and brought them to a hospital. “Two of them succumbed to their injuries while the third is undergoing treatment. His condition is critical,” a police officer from Kondhwa police station said.
 
 The multi-axled truck was loaded with iron rods used for construction. “The truck skidded off the road and fell into the gorge on the second turn of the ghat,” the officer said. The deceased and the injured men have not been identified. 
 
 Fireman  , who helped in the rescue operation, said when the fire brigade team arrived at 11.30am, some local people had already rescued two of the victims. “One person was stuck under the cabin which had separated from its rear portion,” Jadhav added.
 
 When the truck rolled into the gorge, the iron rods tilted forward towards its cabin which then separated from the rear portion because of the weight, Jadhav said.
 
 “The person stuck under the cabin was alive. He had a severe cut on his forehead. One of his hands and his legs were stuck under the metal,” he added.
 
 A rock on the slope had halted the truck. When the firemen started their rescue, the vehicle began to move further down. “We summoned a crane to help prevent the truck from rolling any further,” Jadhav said.
 
 The rescue team kept talking to the injured victim. “It took us half-an-hour to rescue him. We quickly shifted him to a hospital,” Jadhav said.
