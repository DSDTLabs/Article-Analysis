NEW DELHI: A   has  , observing that   between the complainant and him were consensual, and the woman was mature enough to understand what was happening.

 “Facts and circumstances show their physical relations were consensual and consent given by the woman was not under a misconception of fact. The prosecutrix was quite matured enough to fully understand what was happening between the two. There is nothing in her evidence to demonstrate that she was incapable of understanding the nature and implications of the acts which she consented to,” observed additional sessions judge Sanjiv Jain.
 
 The   also observed that the two had met through a matrimonial website, and while the woman's family had approved of their relation, the man's mother had not.
 
 “A meeting between their families also took place. In the third week of February, 2011, the mother of the accused disapproved the prosecutrix. She was very much interested in the accused and knew that their marriage is not certain because of opposition of his mother,” the court said.
 
 The court said that the woman got pregnant, which she terminated as it would have been too early to arrange for a court marriage and the man’s family would never agree. “Without insisting for marriage, she again agreed for physical relations and became pregnant, though she fully knew that the second abortion would deteriorate her health,” the court said.
 
 The court also observed that the messages and chats they had exchanged did not suggest any fraud prior to sexual intercourse.
 
 The court found inconsistencies, exaggerations and contradictions in the testimony of the woman.
