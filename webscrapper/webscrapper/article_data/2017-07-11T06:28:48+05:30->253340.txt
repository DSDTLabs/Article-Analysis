CHENNAI: One man died and two others were injured in an accident involving four   and three cars near   on Sunday night.

 Police said Ilayaraja, driver of a state transport bus bound for Trichy, lost control of the vehicle near Maraimalainagar and hit the median. The speeding bus crashed into a car on the opposite lane killing its driver, Saravanan, on the spot. The 27-year-old was a resident of Madipakkam and was returning to the city from Cuddalore, police said. Saravanan’s co-passengers, Shivkumar, 27, and Vignesh, 28, were injured in the crash and were rushed to the Rajiv Gandhi Government hospital where they are being treated.
 
 Police suspect that Ilayaraja, 30, might have dozed off at the wheel and lost control of the bus. The accident resulted in a pile-up of vehicles as the stretch was poorly-lit. Front and rear portions of the buses involved in the accident were badly mangled. Some occupants of the bus that Ilayaraja was driving were also injured, police said. With the help of locals, police extricated Saravanan’s body from the car and sent it to the Chengalpet government hospital for postmortem.
 
 The accident held up traffic on the   for more than an hour. Passengers travelling to Trichy on the bus had to wait for two hours before police completed rescue operations and shifted them to another bus.
