GURUGRAM: A day after DPSG Palam Vihar announced its sudden ‘indefinite’ shutdown, distressed parents have decided to take their grievances to chief minister minister  . 

 They initially planned to meet the CM at a hotel in   at 10.30am on Saturday. As this information spread, parents of students studying in DPSG Palam Vihar came together on Friday evening and planned to get a meeting fixed with Khattar. 
 
 “We want just 10 minutes of his time to talk to him about the issues we are facing because of the school. Our children will accompany us for the meeting. If we are unable to get an appointment, we would peacefully wait outside the venue and try to meet him when he leaves. We will leave no stone unturned to get justice,” said  , a parent. 
 
 But later in the evening, there was uncertainty around the meeting with parents unsure if Khattar would attend the programme at all. 
 
 The move to petition the CM comes after the school declared on Thursday that it would remain shut till it receives government recognition, which it claims has been pending for the past eight months. Earlier this week, the school was barred from increasing fees by divisional commissioner D Suresh. The order came after it was found that the school had not submitted Form VI, for which recognition is a pre-requisite. 
 
 “We are slowly losing faith in the government. The school is using pressure tactics to make us pay the hiked fee. The future of over 3,000 students is at stake and no one seems bothered,” Yadav said. 
 
 The Palam Vihar school changed from   to DPSG last year, necessitating a fresh recognition. But it also hiked fees under the new branding, which sparked protests. Parents said the new fee was 400% higher than the earlier one. 
 
 Principal   said, “We have people following up with the education department. We are expecting to get recognition very soon. Hopefully by Monday. After that, we will follow the rules.”
