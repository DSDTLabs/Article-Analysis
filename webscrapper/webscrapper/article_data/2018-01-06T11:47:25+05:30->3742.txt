 Besides, the minimum bus fare for rural and urban areas was raised from Rs, 2 to Rs, 3 and the fixed fare is collected in Chennai, Trichy and Coimbatore. However, Madurai, Theni and Dindigul districts have failed to follow the minimum fare.
 
 To rectify the anomalies and to take steps to collect uniform bus fare in both government and private buses in the state, the petitioner sent detail representation to the transport commissioner (private buses), transport secretary, principal secretary of home (transport) and TNSTC (Madurai) managing director on November 13 last year. The officials who received the representations had not taken any action on it. Hence, it was necessary to direct the officials to take appropriate action for collection of uniform bus fare, the counsel prayed.
