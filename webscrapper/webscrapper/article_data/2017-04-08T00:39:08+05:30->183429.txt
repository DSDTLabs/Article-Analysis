The grieving family of the deceased man are left wondering how things would shape up for them in the future as he was the sole breadwinner. His daughters told TOI that they live in fear as four other men, whom they suspect are involved in the crime, could still attack. 

 “Ever since 2011, we have been receiving threats. The accused, not once, but on several occasions have threatened to kill us. I hope we are able to get justice for my father’s death,” said the elder daughter. “These men have made our life a living hell. I remember going to school wearing a skirt, our uniform. But these boys constantly passed lewd comments. I had to either bunk school or wear salwar kameez to school,” she added. 
 
 The younger daughter could barely talk. “I wish I could change my appearance to avoid them. If they could kill my father, they can kill us too. I am worried about our safety and will ask my mother to shift from this area,” she said. 
 
 The family claimed to have approached the cops several times in the past, but no action was taken. “I will never be able to overcome the loss,” the younger daughter said.
