MUMBAI: A couple has been booked by the   police for cheating   of Rs 61 lakh. The police arrested Mohammad Javed Khan (42) on Saturday and are probing the role of his wife, Kishwar Siddiqui, in the case. 

 A magistrate court has remanded Khan in police custody till January 9.
 
 According to the police, the couple ran a firm called Shaad Enterprises. They allegedly lied to officials that their tenders had been accepted for repair and maintenance work of old Mhada buildings in south Mumbai. 
 
 Without actually undertaking any repair or maintenance work at any building, the couple would make fake bills and produce these before Mhada officials for payment. On realising that they were being taken for a ride, Mhada officials lodged a case. TNN
