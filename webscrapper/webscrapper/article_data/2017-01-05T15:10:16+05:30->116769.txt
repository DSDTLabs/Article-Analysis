VIJAYAWADA: Union minister for women and child development   has written a letter to chief minister   seeking his intervention to curb cock fights in the state. She said the   had observed cock fights are cruel, barbaric and in complete violation to Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. 

 "An effective curb on this retrograde killing and betting game will not be possible without your active and personal intervention. May I request you to please issue strict instructions to various departments to ensure compliance with the court order and end this unnecessary and illegal practice," Gandhi said in her letter to Naidu.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP leader and industrialist  , who filed a petition in   seeking stay on High Court's order, said that hearing on his petition is scheduled for Thursday and Friday.
 
 "Some notorious people are indulging in gambling by tying knives to birds. That is definitely wrong. But, what is the problem if one conducts a cock fight without knives and betting? So, we are going to seek an interim order to grant stay on this ruling where the court is making inroads into the privacy of farmers and their right to rear roosters," he told a TV channel on Wednesday.
