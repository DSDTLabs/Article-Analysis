 After the success of the   complex in decongesting  , the directorate of education (DoE) has acquired 1.35 lakh sq m of land in Davorlim to shift Margao-based city schools to the outskirts.
 
  Education officials said that once the election code of conduct, which is presently in force, is lifted, the process of allocation of land to the Margao schools would commence.
  
    GP Bhat said that the land in Davorlim has already been transferred to DoE and that currently, the work of demarcation of boundaries of the property is going on. “In case of the Cujira school complex, schools located in the heart of Panaji with an enrolment of over 300 students were given preference to shift to the outskirts in the first phase. A similar criteria will be set for Margao schools,” Bhat said.
  
  Under the scheme, schools located in congested premises in the heart of the city are provided land on the outskirts by the   on a lease of 99 years. Each school is provided 10,000 sq m of land at the complex. The schools have to invest on their own to construct a building at the complex, while the state develops common facilities for use by the schools like halls.
  
  Though eight old applications to shift to the school complex to come up in Davorlim are still pending with the DoE, the state will now be calling for fresh applications as much time has lapsed since the old requests where submitted.
  
  In Panaji, six schools were allotted land in the first phase, four of which have already moved to Cujira. A fifth school will move from June 2017. There are plans to expand the Cujira school complex and also set up new complexes in Vasco and Mapusa.
  
  School complexes are aimed at relieving cities of the traffic jams experienced, especially during the opening and closing hours of schools, to ensure the safety of students from traffic hazards as well as to allow the institutions to have infrastructure like playgrounds which cannot be provide for in the congested city area.
