Nagpur: A function for   of meritorious students of law from Nagpur University (NU) and those who secured gold medals in LLB and LLM was held on Tuesday at the district court.

 The students who were felicitated included Rahul Kishnani for gold in Constitutional Law, Maithili Chandurkar for 5 gold medals in Criminology Law in five different semesters, Swapnil Chandurkar for being second merit in Criminology Law and Sahil Dewani for 13 gold, 4 silvers and 3 bronze medals up to his final year LLB.
 
 Sudeep Jaiswal, who compèred the programme termed Dewani’s achievement as a miracle and credited exceptional parenting in his life for this feat. Dewani’s parents were also felicitated during the programme.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Dewani expressed about his method of study. “Depending on notes is going to take you nowhere. The books that you read and the commentaries that you listen to will help you. Ultimately, if you want to survive in this field, you need to be a fast learner. During the academics, you have got only 20 subjects but there are a lot more number of laws above that that you need to know.”
 
 Dewani also expressed his gratefulness towards the city and told that Nagpur gave him the required opportunities which he could not have received in other cities. Dewani’s mother, who is also a lawyer, gave Sahil’s devotion, focus and hard work the credit for his exceptional performance.
 
 Chandurkar on the other hand was happy about her accomplishment which she attained after a lot of hard work. She expressed her joy by saying, “The number of people who can be happy with me in my success is my real victory.”
 
 BJ Agrawal ex-president of District Bar Association, congratulated the students for their achievements and also appreciated the gesture of felicitation as it encourages the students to do better. He further urged the achievers to keep up their dedication in the field of law. RJ Rajan of radio 94.3 My FM also graced the event.
