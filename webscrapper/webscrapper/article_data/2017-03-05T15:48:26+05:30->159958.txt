Tom Emmatty's film   depicts two warring parties in a college campus - SFY and KSQ - which are obviously SFI and KSU. The college depicted, Maharaja College, is also obviously Maharaja's College. An interesting fact is that the actor   who played a KSQ leader in the story, is in fact a real KSU leader, who won a KSU seat for the Maharaja's College after 37 years! The college was a stronghold of the SFI and Jino's win had made history. 

 However, an online row has broken between supporters of the two parties, as the film shows the left leaning SFY in a better light. While KSU supporters say that the flm actually depicts the historic win of KSU, SFI supporters say that the film is running because it shows SFI in a better light.
