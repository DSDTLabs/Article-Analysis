Noida: Following complaints about projects being constructed by the   (UPRNN), the Noida Authority’s finance department has decided to review and pursue all projects being undertaken by the Nigam in Noida.   financial controller MM Mishra has written to chief engineer Hom Singh Yadav to review and submit a report at the earliest.

 According to officials, the Nigam is constructing about half a dozen projects in the city. These include the district hospital in Sector 30; the 200-bed super-speciality government hospital in Sector 39; Mahamaya Balika Inter College; Panchsheel Balak Inter College; and an underground multi-level parking lot in Film City, Sector 16A. “We need to review how much of each project has been completed, its cost and whether it is on schedule. Our department will also review if there are any financial irregularities,” Mishra said.
 
 “If we find anything wrong, it will be brought to the notice of senior officials,” he said.
 
 According to information gathered by TOI, none of the projects is on schedule.

The new target date for this project is September 30, 2018. Construction for this project was started on May 19, 2014. Similarly, a multi-level parking facility in Sector 16A being constructed by the Nigam is also facing inordinate delays. The parking facility is coming up at a cost of Rs 76 crore and the work on it commenced on July 19, 2013. It has missed its completion deadline of October 18, 2014, and is only 80% complete.
