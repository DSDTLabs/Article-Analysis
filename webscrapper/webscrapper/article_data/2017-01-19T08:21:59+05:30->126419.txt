PUNE: Every student affiliated to the   (SPPU) would soon be able to upload his or her resume on the university’s   and become instantly visible to recruiters.

 The Students Welfare Board of SPPU has brought students of the institution and recruiters on the same platform successfully for a year. And since the online placement cell has now been running without a glitch, this initiative would be extended to the 800 affiliated colleges of SPPU. This means, over 5,000 students studying under the banner of SPPU would be able to benefit from the scheme.
 
 The old canteen of SPPU has undergone a complete makeover, sporting a corporate look, as activities related to placements and compilation of varsity alumni will be conducted from there. 
 
  said, “We are making a huge effort to bridge the gap between demand and supply of jobs by bringing both ends under one roof with the help of technology. Students passing out from each department look for suitable jobs, every year. At the same time, the industry wants to employ young talent but does not find the right candidates. This portal would bridge this gap as we plan to upload student resumes based on their strengths, knowledge and skills, making the recruiter’s job easy.”
 
 The cell is trying to link the portal with industrial associations and MIDC areas that have their own associations seeking recruitments. Pawar said students who pass out of undergraduate language and science departments often have trouble finding jobs. “For professional courses, departments invite the industries to the campus, but the same does not happen for the language departments. That’s where the portal would help the most,” said Pawar.
