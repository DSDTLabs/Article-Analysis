Ahmedabad: Thanks to some Good Samaritans in the city, a substantial quantity of cooked food that would otherwise be wasted is served to the needy. Every day, huge quantities of cooked food are wasted at public gatherings as well as in restaurants across the city. But these groups have been putting leftovers to good use for long. Valjibhai Rathod, the founder of Manav Sewa Trust based in Sardarnagar, collects and distributes food to about 800 persons per month especially in the eastern parts of the city. “While most of the food comes from households, we also approach the venues of events and functions to collect leftover food,” he said. Jasol Jain Yuva Manch, which comprises around 80 volunteers, also collects food from restaurants and gatherings and feeds the poor. “People call us over the phone and the food is collected by one of our volunteers and distributed,” said Sagar Salecha, the founding member of the group. “We bear the cost of plates on which the food is served.”

 Dhrupal Patel, a member of Spreading Happiness, a volunteers’ youth group based in Ghatlodia, said that the group reaches out to slum areas in the western parts of the city, feeding about 500 persons daily. tnn
