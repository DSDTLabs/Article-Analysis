VIJAYAWADA:  , who was found murdered with her young son in their New Jersey flat, had been facing an ordeal at the hands of her husband  , her family alleged here on Saturday. 

 Two years ago, Sasikala had sent an email to her younger brother,  , who works in a bank in Hyderabad, expressing her distress over Rao's affair with a colleague. In the letter, Sasikala had reminisced about her love marriage with Rao, who she called Hanu, even while expressing her heartbreak.
 
 Sasikala narrated her trauma of "adjusting" to Rao's affair for nearly five years for the sake of her young son, Anish. "I have stopped telling our mother about these things because it will depress her more," she wrote.
 
 Whenever she confronted Rao with his messages to his colleague, he would allegedly insist there was nothing wrong in having an affair. Claiming that Rao dared her to do whatever she could, Sasikala, in her mail to her brother, expressed helplessness over not knowing what to do.
 
 At the family's  , Venu read out the email, and expressed regret over not having been able to help her in her time of need. 
 
 Sasikala further claimed that everyone in her in-laws' family was "cunning and dangerous". "Especially my mother-in-law very very dangerous lady. She is the one who will prepare the plans and play with son...she use us to make her daughter's family rich," her email read.
 
 Krishna Kumari, Sasikala's mother, said Rao's mother turned a blind to his repeated mistakes and told Sasikala to "adjust". 
 
 The family feels the email is a crucial piece of   to show potential motive if Rao is charged with the double murder.
