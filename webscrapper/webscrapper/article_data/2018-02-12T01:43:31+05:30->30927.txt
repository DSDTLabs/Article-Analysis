GURUGRAM:   is looking forward to set up a   and kitchen to provide relief to thousands of people living and working across the city. 

 The canteen will have a capacity to provide meals to one lakh people a day, which will include breakfast, lunch and dinner.
 
 An MCG official said the subsidised canteen is being developed under the project, India Meals. In this regard, MCG has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Mewat-based KW Engineering and Signs private limited, for a period of 10 years. “The main objective behind the project is to provide good quality, nutritious and tasty meals to the common man at economical prices, as envisaged by the central government,” said Narhari Banger, additional commissioner, MCG.
 
 The kitchen will come up in Begumpur Khatola on one acre of land.
 
 KW Engineering and Signs private limited will also set up a distribution system which will be utilised by MCG to deliver the food within Gurugram’s municip-al limits.
 
 The official said the total cost of setting up the kitchen is expected to be around Rs 50 lakh. Three kinds of meals will be served at these canteens, which will include a mini meal at Rs 30, containing 150 gm of dal and 200 gm of rice.
 
 A second type of meal, costing Rs 35 per person, will contain five chapattis, 100 gm of dal and 100 gm of vegetables. A third meal, containing three chapattis, 125 gm of rice, 170 gm of dal and 150 gm of vegetables, will cost Rs 40.
 
 Talking about the requirements of hygiene and cleanliness in the kitchen, Banger said, “We will conduct random checks to ensure the hygiene level is maintained. The quality of raw material stored will be in accordance with the standards set by Food Safety and Security Authority of India.” There will also be an in-house laboratory to check the quality of food material.
 
 Currently, MCG is looking for a place to set up the canteen, while work on the kitchen is likely to start soon.
