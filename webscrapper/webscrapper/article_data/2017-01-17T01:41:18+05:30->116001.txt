In the heart of Rajasthan, lies the majestic  , a quaint Shekhawati town adorned with frescoes, tales and bearings of a regal era gone by. Known for its forts and havelis, this picturesque town provides travellers and visitors with a sense of discovery at every turn. 

 Not a bad place to kick-start your year then, right in the lap of Shekhawati royalty with  , a four-day long multi-format festival to be held between January 26 and January 29, 2017. 
 Taalbelia, seeks to reinvent the wheel, as far as destination music festivals go with wider range of delectable music genres that usually don���t find a spot in the current crop of festivals. 
 Four days, three stages and more than 30 acts promise the ideal combination of the comforts of a vacation immersed in music, arts and crafts, along with adventure, royal hospitality and gastronomic delights, unique to the belt.
 
 Showcasing the majestic and equally magnetic charm of the Shekhawati region and its culture, this round the clock affair, will host three stages and thereby different genres of contemporary, classical and folk music to enthral the residents between two breathtakingly beautiful venues, namely Castle Mandawa and Desert Resort.
 
 The roots of Rajasthan have travelled musically across the globe, transforming cultures and traditions with its nomadic vibe. Taalbelia lets you experience this vibe and a rich confluence of music and other art forms in a boutique environment. Taalbelia serves as a platform for multi-genre artists to come together and create magic! 
 
 Adventure laden activities, safaris, workshops and of course the music throughout the day revs up your spirits to take on the night as a new enigmatic and moving musical experience sets you up and the energy of EDM and underground music takes your spirits higher. From the heights of a royal castle, through the surface of an oasis, to a stroll into the desert, Taalbelia will take you on a journey at every step...

 The Shekhawati region of Rajasthan has awed historians, art followers and connoisseurs from all over the world. It was a key city that catapulted business and conserved timeless art during the Rajput period and its rich heritage still remains a source of pride for us all. Mandawa was the crowned citadel for Shekhawati. The glory of the land has frozen in time, its art; its music and its culinary finesse still mesmerize our senses. But, owing to the lack of conviction led initiatives; the city of Mandawa yearns to regain its erstwhile charm and magic, which Taalbelia seeks to change.
