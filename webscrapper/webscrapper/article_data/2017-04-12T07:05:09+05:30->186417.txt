 As soon as the new government led by the BJP was formed, Naik wrote to the new chief minister about the matter last month. He also presented the correspondence between him and the previous government to establish how the audit was denied in the last regime.
 
 In the second meeting of the cabinet on Tuesday , Yogi approved the central audit, which might spell trouble for the highest authorities in the housing departments and other development authorities. Speaking to TOI, Ram Naik lauded the Yogi government for agreeing to bring transparency into the administrative affairs.
