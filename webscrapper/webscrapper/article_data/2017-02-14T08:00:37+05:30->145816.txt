BENGALURU: For the first time, a Chinese delegation will be participating in  , and the things the delegation may look for are already a topic of discussion. The Chinese delegation will have five officers from the air wing of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

 The five People’s Liberation of Army Air Force (PLAAF), according to officials include Maj Yiu, Col Huang Xinyang, Lt Col Joan Jiaji, Maj Gen Wang Qiang and Sr Col Gao Zhikuan.
 
 Terming this a major development, officials said that until now there was a cautious approach and now the government has become proactive. In the 2011 edition, Chinese journalist Li Miao had stormed into the then defence minister A K Antony’s press conference and interrupted his speech.
 
 Complaining about her struggles, she had said: “…Mr Antony, I congratulate you on the show, which I think is a great success, but I want to tell you that I had not received passes until this morning and I still do not have passes to cover the remaining of the show, are we ( ) really invited for this show?”
 
 The Chinese had never participated in the show and with even the media from the Dragon nation never really entertained wholeheartedly, the delegation this time is likely to garner a lot of attention.
