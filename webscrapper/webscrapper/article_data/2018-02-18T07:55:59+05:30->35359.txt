NEW DELHI: Congress on Saturday sought to fasten the   more tightly on PM Modi, linking it to demonetisation and questioning the saffron mascot's silence on the scandal. Questioning the Centre's claim that the PNB scam revolving around "letters of understanding" started in UPA, AICC released a list of 367 LoUs, saying they all were issued in 2017-18.

 
 Congress president   dismissed as a "diversionary tactic" BJP's allegation that he visited a   jewellery show . Widening the implications of the scam, top Congress "steering committee" ( ) said repeated frauds under the Modi regime had eroded people's faith in the safety of their bank deposits. It said the escape of Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi, Nirav Modi and   pointed to "complicity at the highest echelons of power".
 
 Rahul linked the PNB scam to demonetisation. He called it "strange" that PM Modi banned notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 and put the entire money of the nation in the banking system while Nirav Modi took out Rs 22,000 crore from the banks and fled. "The PM teaches children how to write exams but he cannot tell people how Nirav Modi snatched Rs 22,000 crore from the common man," Rahul said after a meeting of the steering committee. The panel, comprising former PM Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, P Chidambaram among others, laid the blame at the doorstep of the PM. Quoting Chidambaram, Rahul said the scam cannot happen without protection from the top, adding the PMO was aware of the scandal. In the meeting, leaders argued the scam was much larger and its quantum could go up by Rs 7,000 crore in coming days.
