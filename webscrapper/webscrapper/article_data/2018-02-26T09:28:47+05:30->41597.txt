BHOPAL: In a shocking revelation in the beheading of a school girl in Anuppur district, police on Sunday found the killer to be the youth who hanged himself after the incident.

 Sixteen-year-old Pooja Panika was beheaded with a sword outside her school gates on Thursday afternoon just as she arrived for her biology practical exam.
 
 She was attacked from behind and there was a lone witness, a retired teacher. None of the students saw the gruesome murder because they were all inside school.
 
 Late in the evening, police received information that a 26-year-old man Vijay Prajapati known to the girl had committed suicide.
 
 The cause of the suicide was not known. However, police found CCTV footage from the spot, which shows the youth roaming on a motorcycle near the area minutes before the beheading. The youth can also be seen carrying something. 
 
 Police said that a girl also remembers seeing the youth near the spot of the incident.
 
 Police found out that Prajapati was known to Pooja and the two had fallen out recently. During the investigations and the mobile phone records also reveal that Vijay had been seeking physical relationship, but she decided to break the relationship, instead of accepting his demands, this led to bitterness in their relationships, police said.
