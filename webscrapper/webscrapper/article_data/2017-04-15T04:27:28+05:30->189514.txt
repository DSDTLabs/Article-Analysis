KOLKATA: The police have warned   that their goods would be confiscated if they do not abide by the rules. This is being done after repeated drives by cops merely led to hawkers fleeing the spot for the time being only to return later.

 The drive against   continued on Friday — a day before the Bengali new year — when shoppers turned up in large numbers. Cops manually picked up goods stacked along   during their drive.
 
 DC (central) Akhilesh Chaturvedi supervised the drive that concentrated on containing illegal hawking on Lindsay Street. “We told the hawkers that they cannot stock wares blocking the roads,” said an officer. 
 
 Cops plan to invoke sections 66 (4a) and 100 of the the Calcutta Police Act, whereby there can lay claim to goods stacked on roads without no one claiming its rights. These sections will be in addition to IPC Section 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation) that will be slapped against the offending hawkers.
 
 Sources said that they will be beginning Monday’s joint inspection focussing on one central agenda — ensuring that at least two cars can pass through the roads in the New Market area. “For this to happen, two things will be necessary. Firstly, hawkers can’t use cars in the parking lot to stack their goods and secondly, there cannot be a third line of hawkers who sit in front of Hogg market,” said an officer at New Market police station.
 
 However, cops don’t want to raze any of the more permanent structures that have come up around New Market. “In certain cases last year in Humayun Place, we found one structure making way for three stalls. Bamboo and polythene cages occupy less space,” explained the officer.
