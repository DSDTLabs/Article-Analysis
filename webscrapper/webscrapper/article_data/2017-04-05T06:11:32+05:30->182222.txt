 and   on Tuesday started denotifying stretches of state highways to bypass the   ban on liquor vends and bars within 500 metres from highways.

 While Punjab denotified bypass stretches of seven state highways, making them a part of city roads, Bengal officials said portions of state highways would gradually be converted to “district urban“ roads. Curiously , the West Bengal PWD website said the denotification directive was signed on March 16, a fortnight before SC's verdict.
 
 TOI has learnt that states have full authority to change the name of any road which falls under their jurisdiction, except national highways.
 
 Central government sources said there have been talks about how states are trying to avoid losing revenue from sale of liquor through denotification of state highways. However, activist Harman Singh Sidhu, who had fought the case for banning liquor vends along highways, said this effort may also face some legal hurdle.
 
 “We have already filed a case in the Supreme Court against the Chandigarh administration, which denotified some of the state highways passing through the Union Territory ,“ Sidhu told TOI. He said earlier efforts to exclude highways falling in municipal limits from the SC order have been turned down by the apex court.
