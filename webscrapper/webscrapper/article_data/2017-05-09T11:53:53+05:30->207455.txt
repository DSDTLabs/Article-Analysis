For decades Kashmir has been a favourite location for  's movie moguls. Innumerable films, from ' ' and 'Highway' to ' ', have been filmed in the Valley. 

 However, ever since militancy took root there, the shoots have been few and far between. And after last year's September 18 raid on an army camp in which 17 Indian soldiers were killed, filmmakers have been avoiding the state. Now, Mirror has learnt that  's upcoming espionage thriller, ' ' aka RAW, set in 1971 against the backdrop of a prelude to the 1972 Indo-Pak war, will not only feature Kashmir extensively but will also be shot there. 
 
  
  
 The crew has already planned to film at an old railway station in Jammu, a restaurant and hotel in Kashmir, and will soon go on a recce.
 
 "The film is set in 1971 but it isn't about the war. The story unspools before it begins and is inspired by true incidents. We're going to be filming in multiple regions in the Indian sub-continent, including Kashmir and Nepal. We are prepping up to create a thrilling world, the kind you haven't seen before. Our sole aim is to capture the look and feel of the era," informs writer-director  , adding that it was producer   who came up with the interesting title for the project.
 
 Robbie, who is a popular ad-filmmaker, had been writing the script of RAW for the last four years. He had made his directorial debut with the 2003 Sushmita Sen-starrer, Samay, and went on to co-produce Shoojit Sircar's 2005 film, 'Yahaan'. He recently bagged awards at the Epica Awards, Efiies India and Spikes Asia Â­three of the leading advertising events in the industry.
 
 "The leading lady is crucial to the story but we're yet to lock an actress," Robbie informs, adding that Sushant will not only be playing Romeo, Akbar and Walter but is set to have many unique identities and looks.
