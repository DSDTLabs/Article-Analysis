Pune: The proposed Mhalunge township model of the PMRDA has been selected as one of the “2,000-watt society” cities to be developed by the Swedish government.

 Sharing this information with TOI, PMRDA commissioner Kiran Gitte said, “Besides the Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority, PMRDA has been selected for the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Swedish government.” 
 
 The “2,000-watt society” is an environment vision that was introduced in Sweden in 1998. It mainly focused on the need to reduce average primary energy usage to not more than 2,000 watts (48 kilowatt hours per day) by 2050 without making citizens lowe their standard of living.
 
 The draft DP of the Mhalunge township may be published in the coming week and is expected to draw nearly Rs7,000-Rs 9,000 crore worth of investment in the coming two to three years, Gitte said.
 
 He said they would look at investment from Swedish companies that have advanced solutions for smart energy, urban transportation, waste management and air quality.
