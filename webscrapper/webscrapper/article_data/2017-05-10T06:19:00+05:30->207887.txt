KOLKATA:   Road in the Charu Market area turned into a battlefield with stones and bottles raining down on residents and cops in full riot gear trying to bring the situation under control. The clashes that begun late on Monday night between residents of two neighbourhoods was brought under control an hour later, but by Tuesday afternoon, all hell broke loose once again. 

 At least two cops and four locals were injured and train services were disrupted for nearly 10 minutes. Power minister and local MLA Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay and KMC chairperson   rushed to the spot. Finally, a huge police force led by DC (south)   brought the situation under control. Four persons have been arrested.
 
  The trouble began on Monday night when some locals were consuming liquor near the railway line close to the Tollygunge station. There was a marriage ceremony going on at the Mathor-Dompara (Kaalia Colony) located on the other side of the rail bridge and an altercation took place between some   residents attending the ceremony and the Jhalda Math-Khalipara residents (located on the other side of the bridge close to the Charu Market police station). By 12.30am, both sides began pelting stones and bottles at each other. Cops from the Charu Market and Tollygunge police stations rushed to the spot.
 
 Sobhandeb Chatterjee asked cops to remain vigilant even as Mala Roy said it was a   between two individuals that turned violent. “The locals are claiming that there is a liquor den functioning in the area that is creating all such trouble. If that be the case, we will look in to it,” she said.
