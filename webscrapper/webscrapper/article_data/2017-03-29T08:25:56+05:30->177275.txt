Various sports courts, including that for volley ball, basketball and badminton, will be constructed soon.We will build grounds for kabaddi, khoko and malkham.Also, plans are afoot for building an open-air gymnasium to encourage people to take up exercising,“ a PCB official told TOI.
 
 Resident   said, “The residents of Veer Smruti constructed for the widows of 1965 war had to undergo hardships as the open space was used for dumping garbage. Besides the stench emanating from the garbage, the ground had become a health hazard with flies and mosquitoes ho vering over it all the time.“
 
 In 2006, the PCB had planted trees to beautify the place.“However, people continued to dump garbage here. The decision comes as a huge relief,“ More added.
 
 PCB chief executive officer   said, “The plot has been chosen for beautification under the Swachata Pakhwada Abhiyan launched in December 2016. The garden will be thrown open to public before the monsoon. It will be named after well-known hockey player Major Dhyan Chand.“
