 starrer C/O   marks the debut script of Radio Jockey Shaan. Shaan, however, couldn't catch the first show of the film, as he works in Dubai currently. He said this in a facebook post. "I couldn't watch the film for which I have written a script after a long wait of 12 years. It's heartening to hear that the film is being recieved with applause in Kerala. I feel happy and sad at the same time," he writes.
