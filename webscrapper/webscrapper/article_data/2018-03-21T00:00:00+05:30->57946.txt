I’d forgotten this feeling. I was sitting with the script and going over it again and again and wasn’t talking to anyone. The funny thing is that I speak Hindi pretty well and I couldn’t put a finger on why I was so nervous. But then I know that it is a big project and it means a lot to me as a lot depends on this,” says Shraddha, adding, “I have my mum and dad here for moral support as well.”
Shraddha says that while her mother has accompanied her to film sets before, this was the first time her father was on one. “He was like an enthusiastic kid on the set and he was asking me some really basic queries. I found it really cute,” she reveals. 
 Talking about her team, she says, “I’ve met   sir a number of times before and I understand his ways. But it was the first time that I met   and he was a sweetheart.” The team is currently shooting in Lucknow and then will move to Mathura and other interior parts of Uttar Pradesh.
