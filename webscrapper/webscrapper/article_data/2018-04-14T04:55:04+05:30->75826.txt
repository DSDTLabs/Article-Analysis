MUMBAI: The city's iconic culinary favourite,   or Bombil, has become the favourite food of the South American breed of Humboldt   at   zoo. So much so that they must have it daily. 

 Eight penguins bred in captivity in South Korea were transported to the city in July 2016; (one of them died within three months of arrival). They were started on a diet of smelt fish, eel and some Bombay Duck. Zoo keepers soon discovered the penguins were more interested in Bombay Duck and, hence, gradually increased the quantity.
 
 Currently, 90% of their daily diet comprises the sharp-smelling fish. Penguins eat 5 to 6 kg fish daily.
 
  Bombay Duck is a fleshy fish found in large quantities on the   coast and easily available in Mumbai. 
 
 Zoo director Sanjay Tripathi said, "We offered other fish varieties too, but they have taken to Bombay Duck."
 
 The birds are generally fed twice a day, at 9am and around 2.30 pm. Post evening, all lights in the quarantine facility, where the birds are currently lodged, are switched off. The pool at the quarantine facility is around 40 sq feet. However, the pool in the exhibit area where the birds will eventually be moved is expected to be around 400 sq feet.
 
 Zoo authorities said they were in talks with the agency through which they had purchased the penguins, to bring another pair. Zoo officials said discussions were in the initial stage and they were yet to sign a formal agreement.
