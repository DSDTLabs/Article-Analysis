Filmmakers like Anurag Kashyap, Prakash Jha and   believe   is an underrated actor. The talented artiste, who was rediscovered by   in 'Ugly' (2013), has been appreciated for his performances in Abhishek Kapoor’s 'Fitoor' (2016) and Prakash Jha’s ' ' (2016). Rahul will now be seen playing Dev in director Sudhir Mishra’s  , which is touted to be a reverse take on Devdas. 

 Sudhir Mishra feels Rahul has the knack for playing versatile characters. He says, “Rahul is distinctly different in every role he plays. In 'Ugly', the equation his character had with his wife and kid was so unlike the way he is in real life. Every actor always has the choice to either work for himself or for the script. Rahul always takes decisions that make the script better.” According to Prakash Jha, Rahul is a committed actor, “He is professionally competent, but more than that, he is committed to his craft. He explores his character and consistently surprises you,” he says. Anurag Kashyap adds, “It’s a treat working with Rahul. He is the sort of actor who immerses himself in his character and loses himself to the moment. He brings honesty to his performances. He is a true director’s actor.”
 
 Talking about his choice of films, Rahul shares, “I choose to walk a different path, and want to do meaningful cinema that is also commercially viable. I am here singularly on my own merit. I believe that I am on the right side of history because I have chosen to support strong female performances in films like 'Fitoor' and 'Jai Gangaajal'. I know some actors shy away from being cast opposite women in strong roles, but that’s not me. I’m a 21st century man.” Interestingly, Rahul’s critically-acclaimed Canadian film 'Union Leader' (2017) has bagged awards at major international festivals. Rahul is also a part of the Chinese film, 'True Heroes'.
 
 'Daas Dev', produced by Sanjeev Kumar of Saptarishi Cinevision and presented by Gaurav Sharma of Storm Pictures, releases on April 20.
