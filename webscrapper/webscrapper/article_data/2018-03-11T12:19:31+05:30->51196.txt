PONDA: Reiterating that the   (MGP) would support only Ramkrishna 'Sudin' Dhavalikar in absence of chief minister Manohar Parrikar as their leader,   president Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar has claimed that his party is ready for election anytime. The party president also said that the function also kicks off the party campaign for the assembly and   polls.

 The party has commemorated the 55th anniversary of formation of the MGP. The party was formed on March 10, 1963, at the time of the first general election to the legislative assembly of then Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu. Over 500 activists including the current and former MLAs and party leaders attended the meet.
 
 Party leader and tourism minister Manohar ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar was not seen at the function. Dhavalikar told TOI that the minister was busy in a protest programme at the Mopa airport site.
 
 Addressing the gathering,   also came down heavily against people allegedly spreading “wrong news” about the party. He said nobody should underestimate the party as MGP has a “very great history”. MGP’s Bicholim leader   said, “People have made a mistake of not supporting MGP during the last election and that mistake has cost the state dearly. If MGP had at least six MLAs, Sudin could have become the chief minister of the state.”
 
 Leaders including former MLA Rohidas Naik, and senior leaders including Apa Teli, Gajanan Tilu Naik, Ratnakant Mardolkar, Mohan Verenkar were felicitated on the occasion.
