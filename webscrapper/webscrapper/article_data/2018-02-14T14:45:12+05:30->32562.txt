NAGPUR: Considering the ever-increasing incidence of cancer, especially in the region, American Oncology Institute (AOI) has started a 100-bedded   hospital along with other super specialities in the city in MIDC. Named   Speciality Hospital, this is the fourth big dedicated cancer hospital to start in the city in last 2-3 years.

 The hospital has been started by a company — Cure All-Super Speciality & Radiotherapy Centre, formed mutually by the Nangias and the AOI (a US-based cancer care chain) through a memorandum of understanding.
 
 Dr (Brig) Chandrashekhar Bobdey, facility director of the hospital, told TOI that the hospital has started its OPD as well as the operation theatres but it will be formally inaugurated somewhere in mid-March. The AOI will be setting up 25 such centres across India in three years. The first hospital was set up by AOI at Hyderabad and other that followed were at Vijayawada, Ludhiana, Guntur, Bhubaneswar, Coimbatore and the latest one has come up in city.
 
 “One of our strengths is that all our staff of doctors is full-time. These include two doctors from US and 15 local. The hospital has all the state-of-the-art equipment for cancer treatment like the radiation therapy, nuclear medicine, chemotherapy as well as a day care centre. This is the first phase. The next phase will see more developments,” said Dr Bobdey.
 
 Poonam Nangia, one of the directors from the Nangia family, told TOI that the family decided to set up the hospital when some family members suffering from cancer had terrible time plying between Nagpur and Mumbai for radiation therapy. The other director is  . “Though RST Regional Cancer Hospital was there in the city, not a single government or private hospital had the entire radiation therapy infrastructure. Hence, affected by the plight of our own family members as well as citizens of Nagpur we decided to set up the hospital on our own. But we were lucky that we met Dr Bobdey and this project was born,” said Nangia.
 
 Another major strength of this hospital, Dr Bobdey claims, which makes it different from other cancer hospitals is that it has an international tumour board. The board helps the treating doctor take opinion and help of other experts across the globe while deciding on the course of action for each patient. “Entire coordination is done through Hyderabad centre online with rest of the AOI centres. The tumour board meets online every Wednesday to formulate the future strategy for the patients’ diagnosis and treatment,” said Dr Bobdey.
 
 Dr Bobdey said since Nagpur and Vidarbha is said to be the oral cancer capital of India, the hospital is giving a lot of importance to oral cancers and head and neck cancers. Dr   and his family members, also working in ENT field, are some of the team members. Dr Ajay Gupta from Australia and Dr   from US will be the foreign consultants who will be permanently stationed in the city which will make them available for the patient(s) round-the-clock.
 
 Some of the major equipment needed in cancer diagnosis and treatment are linear accelerators and PET scan which have been made available at the hospital. The hospital is also planning to procure gamma camera soon, he added.
