CHANDIGARH: Reacting to INLD’s protest call over SYL canal on Monday, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has said that since the INLD and Congress have no issues to rake up, these parties are trying to salvage their eroded political existence in the name of farmers and the SYL.

 Addressing a gathering at   village in Hisar on Sunday, he said the Supreme Court had fixed July 11 to hear the SYL case and the verdict is expected to be in Haryana’s favour.
 
 “The INLD’s blockade a day before that hearing is just a drama,” he said, further asking the opposition party if stopping of vehicles from Punjab would ensure SYL water.
 
 Khattar also accused the Congress and former CM   of politicizing the issue of farmers. He said, “The Congress is asking us to implement the   report. They should first explain why they did not implement the report during their 10-year tenure. The National Farmers Commission formed in November 2004 gave its report in 2006. At that time there were Congress governments both at the Centre.”
 
 Meanwhile, following the INLD missives about traffic blockade on five key entry points to the state, Haryana government has geared up to ensure smooth passage of traffic through Punjab and Haryana borders.
 
 Officials in the police department said that besides deployment of paramilitary forces at strategic locations, special arrangements have been made to ensure that the INLD men don’t interrupt traffic. Heavy deployments have been made in Ambala, Kaithal, Jind and Sirsa districts.
