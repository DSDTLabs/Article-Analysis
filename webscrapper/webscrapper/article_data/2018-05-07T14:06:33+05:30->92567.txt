NAGPUR: A CCTV camera installed at a house in   filmed a murder at a nearby park in the wee hours of Sunday. The footage helped cops arrest accused   for allegedly killing 30-year-old Amol   over a monetary dispute.

 An injured Bhendekar had been rushed to four private hospitals, where doctors allegedly refused to admit him, and he died due to lack of treatment.
 
 Cops said Patil used to illegally lend money to people, and Bhendekar had taken Rs50,000 from him but stopped paying interest, which led to a fight on Sunday. On Saturday, Bhendekar left home at around 9pm and had a couple of drinks with Patil at the park. After a quarrel, they both went home. At around 12.30am, Bhendekar was sleeping on a cement bench in the park when Patil smashed his head with a stone.
 
 Amol was found by his younger brother Aniket at around 1.30am. Aniket told TOI, “He was on the cement bench with a lot of blood around him. He was alive.”
 
 “I carried Amol home, and called my friend to bring a car. We took him to four hospitals, but they refused to admit him. My brother would not have died in my arms if the hospitals had given him first aid,” added Aniket.
 
 Bhendekar used to run a laundry, and stayed with Aniket, mother Indira and sister Guddi. His father Girdhar has been missing since last two years.
