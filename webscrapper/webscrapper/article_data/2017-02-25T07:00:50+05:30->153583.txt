LUCKNOW: Hundreds of   thronged the temples from the early hours to offer prayers to Shiva on  , resulting in   at all major markets, crossings and even residential colonies. One of the most famous Shiv temples, Mankameshwar, on the embankment road of Daliganj saw people queuing up since morning and by day time, it was a serpentine row of devotees on the road.

 Chowk, which has three major Shiv temples on a single road, saw most traffic jams throughout the day. The temples are Kalyangiri, Koneshwar and Buddheshwar on Hardoi Road. Since Chowk is also a market to several sweet shops and those who specialise in making ‘thandai’, Chowk crossing was packed with vehicles as devotees turned up to drink Mahashivaratri’s thandai. 
 
 Aminabad, which is home to another famous Shiv temple, also witnessed chaos due to long queues of devotees. Rajat Kapoor, a shopper, says, “It was difficult to walk on Latouche Road on Friday as Aminabad’s narrow lanes got even more congested due to the long procession of devotees.” Similar inconvenience was seen in Rajendra Nagar where the famous Mahakaal temple saw crowds of people turning out on busy roads.
