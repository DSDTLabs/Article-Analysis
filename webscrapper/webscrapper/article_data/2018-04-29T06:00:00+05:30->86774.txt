The verdict is out.   is slated to become one of the biggest hits in Telugu cinema and director   is on cloud nine. “The appreciation has been pouring in from all quarters, including celebrities, politicians and aam janata alike. This film is even more special because it has such a complex script which is a big departure from the usual potboilers,” shares an elated Koratala Siva. 

 The social media is buzzing with movie lovers proclaiming that we need chief ministers like Bharat in real life as well, and the director is overjoyed. Having a superstar like   definitely helped, admits Siva. “Firstly, it’s not a regular story. And, Bharat is such a larger-than-life character, that we needed a big star to engage with the audience. Luckily, I got the best. Mahesh’s star power ensured massive openings at the box-office and took the movie to a wider audience,” he says, adding, “I’ve received messages from people who have stated that they will stop breaking traffic rules. To see that we’ve been able to bring some change through our film, even if it’s small, is really satisfying.” 
 
 Produced by DVV Danayya under DVV Entertainments, Bharat Ane Nenu is running successfully in theatres. Even as calls for a sequel to Bharat Ane Nenu grow louder, the director is non committal. “I’m not a big fan of sequels. But in this case, there is a scope to explore. However, for it to happen I need a more powerful script. At this stage, it’s premature to speak of a sequel. We are still taking our time to let the overwhelming reception for the film sink in,” he says signing off.
