NEW DELHI: The Delhi   has set an ambitious target for the six   to wipe out the   of  ,000 cases (as on July 1, 2017) by January 1 next year.

 At a time when government think tanks like Niti Ayog as well as Economic Survey are discussing judicial reforms and ways to reduce arrears, HC appears to have zeroed in on five and 10-year-old cases as key to fighting  . HC on Friday passed a notification announcing its “endeavour to ensure that there is no five or 10-year-old case pending with   as on 01.01.2019.”
 
 The July 1 cutoff date has been communicated to all district judges and entire subordinate judiciary. Data shows that on July 1 last year, approximately 22,000 pending cases pending were 10 years old and roughly 50,000 five years old. Since then, the figures show a steady decline of 5-6% every month till November 2017. Encouraged by these figures, HC is nudging judges to work towards achieving the intended target.
 
 Sources said that a committee of Justices S Ravindra Bhat, Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and R K Gauba is monitoring the management system of the state-level courts. It began work to identify means to reduce arrears in district courts last year.
 
 The state committee is an offshoot of the national courts management system set up by Supreme Court in 2012 to “set standards of performance for courts and address the issues of quality, responsiveness and timelines.”
 
 The HC committee consulted all district judges and they were asked to submit a detailed action plan suggesting ways to reduce arrears and maximise efforts in this regard, a source said. “Progress reports keep coming from the district judiciary for each court every month. After consultations with all district judges, the cutoff date was fixed as July 1, 2017,” the source told TOI.
 
 The national case management system is meant to formulate and put into play best practices across all high courts so that arrears can be cut and litigants can get access to data about the status of their cases.
