About 90 minutes from now,   will rule our living rooms — the first season of   is here! 

 
 
 
 A clone of the Salman Khan-hosted Bigg Boss, which follows the Big Brother format first developed by a Dutch network, this reality show will bring together 12 celebrities, who will be under constant scrutiny for 70 days. It will also mark the small screen debut of Jr NTR aka Tarak. According to rumour mills, the actor has been offered the highest ever pay-cheque that any Telugu actor has ever got to host a TV show. In fact, reports suggest that it is the most expensive TV show ever produced in Telugu with a massive house being erected on over 10,000 square feet area in  , with 60 cameras focussed on the contestants.
 
 The makers apparently approached 100 celebrities before zeroing in on the chosen dozen. Some of the names that have been tossed around includeShiva Balaji, Mumaith Khan,  ,  ,   Babu, Archana Madhu, Priya Kalpana, Mahesh Kathi, Jyothi, Sameer, Hari Teja, Katthi Kartheeka. With this probable list, Bigg Boss Telugu season 1 promises to be a heady cocktail of drama, humour, new friendships, tears and betrayal. However, we will have to wait till the final 12 are unveiled as the clock strikes 9.
 
 While there are apprehensions that the show, whose Hindi version has never failed to spark controversy in its decade-long run, might offend the sensibilities of the Telugu TV audience, but Jr NTR is pretty confident that it will be “fascinating” and have a “huge relevance”.
 
 But we won’t know until we see it, right? Bring it on, Tarak!
