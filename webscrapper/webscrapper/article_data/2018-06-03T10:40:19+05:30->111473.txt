PUNE: Two goldsmiths were booked on Friday for misappropriating 490g of gold worth Rs14.80 lakh on the pretext of making ornaments between May 15 and May 25. 

 
 
 The jeweller they worked for —   (54) — lodged an FIR against them. 
 
 Sub-inspector   of the Khadki police said, “Kothari had appointed the two goldsmiths from   around two years ago. They were living in Mumbai. He authorized them to collect gold from other jewellers on his behalf from different places, including Pune, to make ornaments.” 
 
 Kothari collected gold from various jewellers. But they did not receive any ornaments from   because the suspects fled with gold. 
 
 Kothari told TOI, “I used to give orders to one of the suspects’ uncle in Mumbai to make ornaments for me. One day, he introduced me to his nephew and requested me to give him work.” 
 
 Kothari then started supplying pure gold to him and his accomplice to make   in their workshop. 
 
 “One day I called one of the suspects and told him to come to my shop in Pune and collect gold as I had received an order. He told me he was travelling to Pune by train but he did not reach here. After 7pm, his phone was not reachable,” Kothari said, adding that he initially thought the suspect would be in a ghat area and was not getting the network. But later the suspect switched off his phone. 
 
 “I rushed to Mumbai to trace them but they had closed down their workshop and fled,” Kothari said. 
 
 “We have registered a case under sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. We have launched a hunt for the suspects to arrest them at the earliest,” Mahadik said.
