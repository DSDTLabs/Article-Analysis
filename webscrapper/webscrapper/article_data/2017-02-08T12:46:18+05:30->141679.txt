NAGPUR: Aggrieved LLB first semester (3-year) students of   received support from   (CYSS), the youth wing of AAM Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday. A delegation of CYSS led by Piyush Aakre met Pro Vice Chancellor Pramod Yeole demanding that students who scored 40% marks be declared pass immediately. 

 Warning of intense protest if the demand was not met, the CYSS said the NU is passing the buck on colleges for its negligence. 
 
 “According to the NU circular on new rules, 40% marks in each subject are needed to pass the exam. But, this was not communicated to the college in due time and now students are suffering because of NU’s negligence,” CYSS said in its complaint to the NU.
 
 CYSS said Yeole told them that the an inquiry has been initiated to find out how students were misguided by the colleges by ignoring the NU notification. Yeole reportedly told them that a notification has been issued stating that the 40% pass criteria would be implemented from next academic session. However, the CYSS demanded that it should be enforced from this session itself.
 
 On Monday, the students had approached chancellor Ch Vidyasagar Rao, chief minister  , union HRD minster Prakash Javadekar and state education minister Vinod Tawde for help.
 
 On February 1 and 5, TOI had reported how NU’s alleged goof-up left over 3,000   in a quandary.
 
 The CYSS alleged that the entire new system is flawed. They claimed there was no clarity on eliglbilty after clearing the entrance, teaching period, and passing marks in theory and internals.
