COIMBATORE: As many as 10   from the   prison passed in the Class XII examination. K Velmurugan, 36, a   life convict from Erode, scored 1006 marks out of 1200 and another life convict  , 44, scored 965 marks, said superintendent of the prison M Senthilkumar.

 According to prison authorities, 13 life convicts, mostly convicted for murder charges, appeared for the examination. They were taken to Puzhal - I prison in Chennai from Coimbatore to write the exam. 
 
 Ten life convicts cleared the examination. Velmurugan scored 173 marks in Tamil, 174 in English, 157 in history, 182 in economics, 163 in commerce and 157 in accountancy.
 
 Boopathy, from Ammapettai in Salem district, scored 172 marks in Tamil, 157 in English, 179 in history, 184 in economics, 140 in commerce and 133 in accountancy. K Kumar, another life convict, scored 574 marks.
 
 “We provided sweets to the convicts for clearing their examinations and the other prisoners also commended them. Those who passed the examination will select under-graduate courses offered by Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU),” said Senthilkumar.
 
 Some convicts wanted to pursue BBA, BA (history) and other arts courses. “They cannot select science courses as they cannot take practical examinations. So most of the life convicts were offered arts and related courses in prisons,” said a source. 
 
 “The courses offered by IGNOU are as good as regular courses. So we are trying to get more prisoners to pursue higher studies,” said Senthilkumar.
 
 A total of 57 life convicts in the Coimbatore central prison who appeared for the Class X examination are waiting for the results.
