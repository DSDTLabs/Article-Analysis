One of India’s popular dance reality shows, 'Dance+ 3', has kick-started its third season with a bang. Featuring handpicked performers from across the country, it has showcased myriad dance forms — from Indian Classical and hip-hop to indigenously created styles. 
This year, the quality of performances has been pushed Ek Level Up with the introduction of international hip-hop sensation Fik Shun — the first eminent artiste of Remo’s Squad — who set the dance floor ablaze last week. 
 That’s not all, the amusing camaraderie between Super Judge Remo, host   and the mentors, Shakti, Dharmesh and Punit, has ensured that there is never a dull moment on the show.
 Tonight promises to be a starry night as   will be seen joining the fun to talk about his movie, Jab Harry Met Sejal, which releases on August 4. At his charming and witty best, King Khan enchanted the audience, contestants and judges alike. The contestants also planned a surprise for SRK, which made him blush. The vibe of the evening was so contagious, Shah Rukh even tried his hands at Indian classical dance. The superstar, who we have always seen doing   dance numbers, matched steps with a Bharatnatyam group. 
 This weekend will also feature the international dancing stars, Paul and Brittany, who will make the test even more difficult for the contestants. 
 Hyundai presents 'Dance+ 3', powered by Oppo camera phone, Amazon.in and Patanjali Power Vita, airs every Saturday and Sunday at 8 pm on Star Plus.
