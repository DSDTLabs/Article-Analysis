JAIPUR: While there’s a huge demand for seats in clinical postgraduate medical courses, there are many lying vacant in other streams, mostly in  . The medical education department is now contemplating how to fill such seats. To attract students to such courses, the department has decided to waive the provision for bonds.

 It has always been a difficult task to fill seats in all non-clinical branches, especially in anatomy, biochemistry, pharmacology, preventive & social medicine (PSM),   medicine. After the mop-up round last year, there were no takers for 74 PG seats in government medical colleges in the state. This was because candidates showed more interest in clinical branches rather than non-clinical ones. In Sawai Man Singh Medical College, 12 seats for PG courses were lying vacant after the completion of mop-up round last year.
 
 Now, to address the issue, the medical education department has waived the bond requirement. “We have recommended to scrap the bond requirement for non-clinical branches which are less popular among candidates,” said Bachanesh Kumar Agarwal, additional director (administration), directorate of medical education. 
 
 It is compulsory for PG students to sign a bond of Rs 5 lakh assuring that they would not leave the course without completing it. Also, another bond of Rs 25 lakh bond is compulsory for PG students assuring the government that they would work for at least five years in  
 
 Branches such as anatomy and physiology provide opportunities for candidates to enter the teaching profession, but candidates do not show much interest in them for various reasons. “If a MBBS doctor posted at a PHC in a remote and difficult area opts for a non-clinical branch such as anatomy, he goes back to his PHC after completing the course. His PG in anatomy is not useful for him unless he gets a teaching job in medical colleges. But, these colleges do not have much jobs in non-clinical branches,” said Dr  , a public health expert.
