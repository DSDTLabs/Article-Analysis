JABALPUR: Madhya Pradesh government will decide the rate of milk, even if it is sold by private dairy owners. 

 Madhya Pradesh High Court had passed this order in 2007 but the dairy owners had moved an appeal in the   against it. The apex court has now rejected the appeal.
 
 While hearing a petition filed by Dr   of Nagrik Upbhokta Margdarshak Manch, a volunteer organisation, in 2007, MPHC had ordered that the MP government should decide the rate of milk sold by dairy owners. The petitioner had informed the court that milk and other milk products have been kept under essential commodities, and hence state government should decide the rate.
 
 He had filed the plea in the wake of spiralling milk prices all across the state. Besides, milk exported from Jabalpur was also challenged through the petition.
 
 MPHC, in January 2007, had ordered the state government to fix the rate of milk sold to people in the state and it had also banned export of milk from Jabalpur district. Dairy owners filed an appeal against the High Court order, in the Supreme Court in 2009. 
 
 The Supreme Court stayed orders of the High Court, but as the appellants did not appear before the court after the stay, the court dismissed the appeal. Following dismissal of the appeal, stay of apex court is vacated and the high court’s earlier orders come into immediate effect, said sources.
 
 “I have written to principal secretary, food and civil supplies department and also to the collector,” Najpandey told TOI.
 
 “But, despite this, the Madhya Pradesh government is not fixing the milk prices, so I have moved a contempt petition in the Madhya Pradesh High Court,” Dr PG Najpandey added.
