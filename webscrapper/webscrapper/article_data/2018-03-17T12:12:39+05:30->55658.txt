CHANDIGARH: Two men in an SUV fired two shots in the air and robbed a 30-year-old resident of Punjab’s Abohar of his car in Sector 35 in the early hours of Friday, the second gunpoint   in the city within 48 hours.

 Vikram said he had come to the city a few days back and was staying at the house of his friends in Phase II of Mohali. On Thursday night, he had gone to have dinner at   with a friend. After dropping him in Sector 35, Vikram was returning home, when the SUV hit his car from the rear around 2am. As he stepped out, one of the two men pointed a gun at his forehead. When he resisted, the accused fired two shots in the air. One of the accused drove away his car. Vikram’s mobile phone and wallet was inside the car.
 
 Vikram took help from passers-by and informed the police. Cops from Sector 36 police station, operations cell and crime branch reached the spot and flashed a message. Police carried out a search operation but failed to trace the accused. Later, cops recovered the mobile phone of Vikram from a roadside in Sector 51.
 
 Police suspect Jodha, a criminal who had escaped from the custody of police in February, could be behind the robbery. Earlier, Jodha and his accomplice had robbed a taxi driver of his Toyota Innova SUV in a similar manner near the light point of sectors 33 and 45 on December 17, 2017. However, Vikram did not identify Jodha after seeing the picture of the criminal in a police file.
 
 After recording Vikram’s statement, Sector 36 police registered a case under Sections of IPC and Arms Act. Police are scrutinizing the CCTV footage of nearby areas to get clues.
 
 UT SSP   said, “We are close to identifying the accused.”
