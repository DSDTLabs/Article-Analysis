Marylin Monroe's 'The Seven Year Itch' shot, in which her white dress billowed up, is an iconic cinematic moment of all time and now the behind-the-scenes story has been unveiled. 

  
  
 An old home-shot footage has surfaced that shows the scene being shot. It was on September 15, 1964, that director of the film   and Monroe were scheduled to film the scene on a sidewalk in New York. 
 
  But the crowd of journalists and bystanders, which included Monroe's husband  , who famously hated the dress, turned rowdy that the duo were forced to re-shoot the scene on the 20th Century Fox lot. 
 
 Among the crowd, then was a man called Jules Schulback, who followed Monroe and captured the scene on film.  's illuminating footage which has been edited down to a 12-second video. 
 
 Schulback's granddaughter   and her husband   found the footage in a plastic bag filled with old films that he had made of family trips, bar mitzvahs and more. 
 
 The original short film is 3 minutes and 17 seconds long. It features humorous title cards which Schulback had added in, and captures Monroe in a second-floor window blow-drying her hair. The footage then cuts to the icon standing on the subway grate preparing to shoot the scene.
