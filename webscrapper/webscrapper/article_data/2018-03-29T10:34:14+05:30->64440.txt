After young director   came out openly to accuse   of breaking his trust, actor   seems to have come in support of the youngster slammed Gautham Menon in a sarcastic manner. The senior actor plays the lead role in ' ' directed by   Narean and produced by Gautham Menon.

 Yesterday, Karthick and Gautham had a clash over Twitter where Karthick Naren mentioned that he has been cheated without mentioning the person's name. When the senior director took a dig at the youngster on his social media page saying some young filmmakers whine about their passion instead of growing a pair, Karthick opened up in his next post saying that he had the pair to trust Gautham and collaborate with him even when many advised against it.
 
 Later in the evening once we reported the issue from Gautham Menon's side, actor Arvind Swami seems to have taken Karthick Narean's side and tweeted, "Yes we all can grow a few things, a pair of eyes that sees what we do to others, a pair of ears to hear the truth, a conscience to tell us when we are wrong and a pair of whatever to accept our mistakes and apologise...instead we grow our list of commitments that we can’t keep." (Sic)
 
 Gautham Menon had said, "This misunderstanding between Karthick and me has been brought about by people with vested interests.   and I have sorted it out since then. So, it’s all good.” 
 
 
  
 
 Touted to be a thriller, 'Naragasooran' stars Arvind Swami, Shriya Saran, Sundeep Kishan, Aathmika and Indrajith in lead roles. Produced by Gautham Menon's Ondraga Entertainment, Ron Ethan Yohaan has scored for the film.
