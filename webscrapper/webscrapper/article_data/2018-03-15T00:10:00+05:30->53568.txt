 For me being a bass guitarist feels like any other profession, even though I am the only woman in the  . It feels normal to me. However, some people still tell me that it’s a unique career choice for a woman. 
 
  Like any other profession, we (women) have to prove ourselves. You have to speak louder and repeat yourself in order to make a point and prove yourself. Once you do that, people start taking you seriously. You need to work hard at it and show people your talent. You need not be a rebel to prove your point.
 
  Although there aren’t many women bass guitarists, things are changing slowly. Young girls are now performing on stage, and are taking up tougher roles. As an Indian woman, the society expects you to be in a certain way. But that concept is slowly changing. Families are realizing this and opening up. One way to make an impact would be to get your music out and let it be seen.
