NEW DELHI: The fire in   on Monday has brought the focus back on the   project of the area. The narrow lanes continue to pose a major hurdle for fire services, and traders claim that hardly any work has taken place in the past several years. 

 Late into the night, traders were busy warding off potential thieves from the alleys, as the shops had no security left.
 
 Yogesh Singhal, president of Bullion And Jewellery Association in Kuncha Mahajani, said that wires continue to pose danger to Asia’s biggest gold and jewellery market. “A few years ago we had installed m-seals at heavy voltage wires which could trip in case of short circuits, but smaller wires continue to pose a problem,” Singhal added.
 
 The association claims there are almost 1,500 outlets that provide large amounts of revenue to government, but no services are offered in return. “The only solution is to allot us a new dedicated commercial space like BKC,” Singhal Said.
 
 Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Vyapar Mandal, pointed out that the area is like a ticking time bomb. “The Shahjahanabad Board was supposed to revamp Chandni Chowk but nothing has happened,” said Bhargava.
 
 “Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation is the nodal head of the project and north corporation will initiate work when the civic body is assigned. But no work has been assigned yet,” said a senior official from north corporation.
