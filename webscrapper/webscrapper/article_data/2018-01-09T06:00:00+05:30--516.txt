NEW DELHI:   accused the   government on Monday of “muzzling dissent” and adopting an “ostrichlike approach” by “prosecuting” the newspaper and the journalist who exposed the alleged   data breach.

 Congress spokesperson   alleged that there have been systematic assaults on scribes and an atmosphere of fear and violence has been created against them. He asked people to introspect whether they want a liberal, democratic India or a theocratic and fascist country.
 
 Tewari alleged that media organisations have been systematically hounded and targeted and demanded the FIR “against ‘The Tribune’ and the journalist” be withdrawn “if the government believes in freedom of press”.
 
 He said the paper that warns the government that private data of thousands of citizens are at risk is rewarded with an FIR. “If this is not fascism, if this is not trying to muzzle dissent, if this is not gross abuse of state authority, then I am afraid, we possibly do not have a definition for it.”
