Chandigarh: Farmers’ organisations in Punjab, on Tuesday, threatened to launch ‘jail bharo’ agitation next month to press for their demands, including complete farm debt waiver and revision of crop prices.

 The farmers’ bodies expressed their dissatisfaction with the present allocation of Rs 1,500 crore, which they said, made for debt waiver only for loans up to Rs 2 lakh and sought a complete waiver, especially in view of growing suicides in the state.
 
 Four farmers' organisations—Bhartiya Kisan Union (Kadian), BKU (Sidhupur), Pagri Sambhal Jatta and Doaba Sangharsh Committee—held a meeting at Kisan Bhawan, Chandigarh, to discuss the plight of growers and devise a strategy to put pressure on the Centre and the state government for their demands.
 
 BKU (Sidhupur) president Bhog Singh said the farmers’ organisations will court arrest after August 9 to press the government to address their issues. Farmers are demanding crop price as per the suggestions of the Swaminathan Commission report which suggested 50% profit over and above the cost of production. They are also demanding the entire debt of all the farmers be waived as they are unable to repay their debt because of inadequate rates of their crops. The farmers also want that crop be procured by the government so that they are not exploited.
