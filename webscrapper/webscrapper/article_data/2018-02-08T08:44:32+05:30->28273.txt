PANAJI: The Goa Children’s   on Wednesday granted anticipatory bail to the principal of a Margao-based school who has been accused in the corporal punishment case of a 13-year-old student.

 In the event of his arrest, the principal will be released on bail after furnishing personal bond of Rs 25,000, the court said. The investigating officer informed the court that despite efforts made, he was unable to record the statements of three students from the same class of the victim boy as the parents of the children are not co-operating and stated that they do not want to involve themselves in the case.
 
 President of the court,  , said it was strange that the students weren’t coming forward to give their statements and that their parents weren’t cooperating, despite the victim boy stating that so many boys were watching. “Why is it that not a single student is coming forward?” she asked.
 
 The court observed that the act of the   police of sending a letter to the principal with a request to direct three classmates of the victim boy to remain present at Margao town police station with their parents to record statements, was against the mandate of law. “The statements of minors shall be recorded at their residence or at a place where they usually reside or the place of their choice,” the order stated.
