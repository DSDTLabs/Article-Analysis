Mohali:   drove six people to manhandle the woman conductor and driver of a Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) bus at Zirakpur on Tuesday night.

 The men accused of assaulting driver Nachatar Singh (54) and the conductor are Avinash Kumar, Bhupinder Singh, Digvijay Singh, Rajbir Singh, Vishal Singh, and Arun Kumar. It happened at around 9.30pm when the packed CTU bus on its way from Chandigarh to Zirakpur. Near Zirakpur, blaring the horn, the accused in their SUV tried to overtake the bus in the middle of heavy traffic.
 
 The driver said: “They even tried to rub their car into the side of my bus but I kept avoiding a collision. Near the Zirakpur bus stand, they pulled up in front of the bus, forcing me to stop. They came out of the SUV, grabbed my collar, and dragged me out of my seat. Without saying anything, they started to thrash me.”
 
 The driver’s turban was tossed as he was punched in the face. When the conductor came to his rescue, she had to take foul language and assault. She raised an alarm, at which some of the passengers and people from the neighbourhood came over to save her and the driver. The argument continued for over an hour, as the passing CTU drivers stopped by to help their colleagues.
 
 The drama wasn’t over until they called the cops. However, the accused managed to sneak out from the spot. They were charged with injuring public servants to deter them from performing their duty.
