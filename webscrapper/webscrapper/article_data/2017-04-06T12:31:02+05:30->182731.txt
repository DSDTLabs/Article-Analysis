After all the drama during the pre-wedding rituals, Ichha ( ) and Babbal ( ) finally get married in the latest episode of the show, ' ', which airs from Monday – Friday at 8 pm on Sony SAB.

 Last week, the wedding preparation saw a lot of fun and excitement where several actors performed at the sangeet with Ichha unaware that she is the bride. She even declined Babbal’s proposal at the mandap as she wanted to her parents’ approval. She returned to the Prataap household only after she met her parents in Naagistan and got their consent to marry Babbal. The chaos finally ends with the couple tying the knot without any further ado in the latest episode. With the blessings of all the family and Naagistan members, Ichha and Babbal enter a new stage in their life. Their love eventually conquers all obstacles.
 
 Priyal says, “Ichha is on cloud nine now. After all, she got married to the love of her life following a lot of confusion and drama. However, Babbal is still unaware of the fact that his better half is an snakewoman. Her real struggle will start now, after marriage.”
 Mishkat adds, “Babbal still cannot believe that he is married to his love and that all his efforts to woo her have worked. He is now excited to start their new life together.”
