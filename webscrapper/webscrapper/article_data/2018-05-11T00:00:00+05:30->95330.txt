After Kappal, Punjabi lass   didn’t take up any Tamil film. It is only now that she has been signed on to play one of the female leads in Deekay’s Katteri. Ask her why and she says, “I was busy with Punjabi films as I do three films a year. Whenever I was approached for films, it included working for multiple schedules, something that didn’t work out for me as I was busy there. In fact, the same team of Kappal had approached me for a couple of films that they were doing, but I couldn’t take it up owing to my busy schedules. But this time for  , the team said that they would finish my portions in one schedule. I am excited to be here... back in Kollywood. It is always a different energy when you work here in Tamil. People are nice and warm here. It is good to be back doing Tamil films.” 

 Sonam plays Vaibhav’s wife in the film. “It is good to work with Vaibhav again after Kappal. Though this is my second film in Tamil, I still haven’t picked up the language. Vaibhav has always been helpful. It is nice to work with someone whom you are familiar with,” she says. The team is presently shooting in a 
 forest in Chennai. 
 
 The actress says that she is now keen to do more work in Kollywood. “There is a huge difference between working for Punjabi and Tamil films. The team is excellent here, and are on their toes all the time. During my debut, I used to get stressed all the time since I don’t know the language. But now, I am picking up Tamil, and my director, too, is helping me with the lines. I am more relaxed and confident now. I am definitely looking at doing more films here,” she signs off.
