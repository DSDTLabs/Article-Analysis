  'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' introduced the audience to the iconic Jaadu ki Jhappi while 'Lage Raho Munna bhai' got us acquainted with the iconic Gandhigiri. The unusual concepts have fetched love from the audience and are still etched in everyone's memories.
 
  There has been huge anticipation for the third film ever since the second film released. However, the film will go on floors only once the actor-director finishes their prior commitments.
 
  While Sanjay Dutt has been on a roll with a plethora of films lined up, Rajkumar Hirani too is busy with 'Dutt biopic'.
