VELLORE: A day after a 10-year-old girl was strangled to death at her house in  , police arrested the girl's elder brother in connection with her murder. 

 Police said the youth, L  , 20, murdered his sister Arthi as he saw the girl to be an obstacle for his marriage with his lover, a dalit girl, from a nearby village.
 
 Manikandan asked the permission of his widowed mother Valli, to marry the girl, but she objected to it citing the girl's caste.
 
  She also dissuaded him stating that no one from their Vanniyar community would come forward to marry his sister Arthi. A month ago, Valli found him speaking to her over the phone, and picked up a quarrel with him. 
 
 On Sunday night, Manikandan came home in an inebriated condition. Since Sunday was their turn to use the common well to water the crops, he woke his mother and brother and forced them to go to their land to water the crops. "After they left, leaving Arthi at home, Manikandan had tried to commit suicide. But he changed his mind in the last minute and decided to murder his sister thinking that she was the obstacle for his relationship," said D Rajangam, inspector of police, Ranipet.
 
 Manikandan smothered Arthi her using a pillow and strangulated her using a nylon rope. "Valli came back home to find the girl dead," said police. Manikandan staged a drama painting it to be a case of murder for gain. He told the police that the earring that wore by his sister, and cash in the house were missing. However, the girl's earring was found beneath her mat , said the inspector.
 
 Growing suspicious, the police picked him for inquiry. On interrogation, he confessed to the crime. Based on his confession, police registered a case under Section 302 of the IPC and remanded him in custody.
