HYDERABAD: A massive   at   in Somajiguda on Tuesday morning forcing the staff to immediately evacuate guests from the premises. Three fire tenders were pressed into service to douse the blaze that started on the fourth floor of the nine-storey property located in the heart of the city. No casualties were reported.

 While investigation into the fire accident that occurred around 8 am is still on, initial probe of the fire department attributes the cause to an electrical fault. Alarmingly, the department's report suggests that the hotel was functioning without the mandatory No Objection Certificate. It has now decided to initiate action against the owner under the Fire Act and also recommend the closure of the building for being “unsafe" and a “fire hazard".
