NEW DELHI:   after the municipal elections, the three corporations are yet to form different   even though these were supposed to be constituted by May-end. The corporations comprise three types of committees: statutory, special and ad hoc. The standing committee, education and rural committees are statutory ones. The standing committee passes all proposals before these go to the house. 

 North’s mayor Preety Agarwal met Satyendar Jain on Tuesday to discuss the issue. “This is due to the delay in outlining the new boundaries of all the municipal zones in three corporations and we have asked the minister to speed up the process. We have been assured that the work will be completed in a week’s time and Delhi government will notify the same,” said Agarwal. 
 
 Senior officials claimed there’s a need for equal distribution of wards and officials in all zones of the three corporations. “It will happen once the Delhi government notifies the zones as per the new boundaries. The proposal was sent to the government, but there were a few corrections that were to be made. For instance, north corporation had proposed the merger of   and City to balance out the number of wards in each zone. The final decision is with the government now,” an official said. 
 
 A senior Delhi government official said the file has been cleared and the notification would be out in a week’s time.
