GAYA: In an apparently bizarre action, Gaya police on September 12 registered an FIR against suspended JD(U) MLC Manorama Devi for an offence that was allegedly committed on 10 May, 2016, a good sixteen months back. The offence pertained to the recovery of cartridges in excess of permissible limit.
 
  According to the contents of the   police station FIR no 305/17, a raid was conducted at the MLC’'s   residence on 10 May'2016 in connection with her son Rocky’s involvement in murder case. During the raids, among other things, 146 cartridges of 12 bore, 53 cartridges of .315 bore, eight cartridges of 30.06 bore 09 cartridges bearing DO4X56MSCH were recovered.
  
  The MLC had three arm licenses (one double barrel gun, one rifle and one pistol) in her name. Her husband   did have one rifle licence in his name.
  
  The FIR further said Manorama Devi and her husband, as per the rule were entitled to keep only 50 cartridges of 12 bore and the 146 cartridges recovered from her house exceeded the permissible limit by a good 96 cartridges. Moreover, the .315, 30.06 and DO4X56MSCH cartridges did not match with the licensed weapons issued separately in the couple’s name.
  
  The case registered by Rampur PS SHO Ranjit Vats, on the basis of his self-statement attributes the delay to the non-matching of the weapon and the cartridge at the time of seizure. The case has been registered under section 25 (1b) of the Arms Act.
  
  The inordinately delayed FIR has become a subject of ridicule in the legal circles in Gaya.
  
  Asked if action would be taken against police officers who deliberately or otherwise delayed the registration of the FIR by more than a year thereby causing avoidable embarrassment to the superior officers,   J   said that he has only recently joined the post and the matter did not relate to his tenure.
