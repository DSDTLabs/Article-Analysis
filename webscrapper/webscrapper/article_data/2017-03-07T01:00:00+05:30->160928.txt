The students of   were looking forward to host the music composer duo   on Sunday. But all those waiting to attend the last day of 'Renaissance', the annual cultural festival of the college, were left dejected when the composers cancelled the event the night before. Till March 4, one day before the event, the students' union of the college had planned everything and were waiting for them to perform and conclude the last day of Renaissance. But the duo updated a status on their official   page on the night of March 4, which read, "We are sad to inform that we will not be performing at Kirori Mal College, New Delhi tomorrow i.e 5th March 2017 due to various managerial issues!! Hope to see you soon Delhi!"

  
 Sachin Saipanwar, the president of the students' union told us that the event was cancelled from the composers' side. The college did not cancel the event. He said, "The duo wanted the entire payment in cash and we were paying them through cheque. We had already handed over the advance payment amount, but they cancelled the event Saturday night and updated a status on their Facebook page. We had made all the arrangements, the posters were out, but we couldnâ€™t do anything since it was cancelled from their side."
 
 Since the cancellation was last minute, the students' union called a local band to perform at the fest.
