PANAJI: The crime branch of Goa police has appealed to the public to provide evidence in the murder case of social activist  . The high court of Bombay at Goa on Monday granted an additional eight week’s time to the crime branch to complete the investigation.

 Crime branch police inspector Vishwesh Karpe told TOI that till date, his department has not been able to collect adequate evidence in the case. “If there is any witness in the case, then he or she should come forward to solve the case,” Karpe said. 
 
 Earlier, the crime branch, after having investigated the case for 10 months, had decided to file a closure report as there was a “mistake of facts”. The department had recorded statements of over 20 witnesses.
 
 The district and sessions court had rejected the crime branch application seeking permission to conduct a polygraph (lie detector) test on the two boys who were the last to see the social activist alive.
 
 In April, 2017, the crime branch registered Dias’ death as a murder on the directive of the high court.
 
 Dias went missing on the intervening night of November 5 and 6, 2015 after he went for a swim in a water body at St Estevam. 
 
 Dias and the two boys had camped at a hut for the night near the   sluice gate on the north-eastern part of St Estevam along the river. The boys later told the police that Dias had gone for a swim alone.
 
 His body was found floating in the Mandovi river near Cupa at St Estevam. 
 
 Police had claimed the death was due to drowning, but Bismarque's friends, family and some social activists had refused to accept this version. They alleged the Old Goa police did not carry out a proper investigation and the case be transferred to the crime branch.
