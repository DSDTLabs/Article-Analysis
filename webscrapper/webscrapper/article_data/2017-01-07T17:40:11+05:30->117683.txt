GAYA: In yet another setback for the prosecution in Gaya road rage case in which Rocky Yadav, son of MLC Manorama Devi, had allegedly killed  , a Gaya schoolboy on May 7 last year, constable Tej Narain Singh Yadav, who was deputed at the MLC’s AP Colony residence, on Friday turned hostile and retracted from his statement given before the case investigating officer.
 
  During his examination in the court of additional district and sessions judge S P Mishra, the police constable said Rocky was not seen at his Gaya residence on that fateful day. Yadav, in his earlier statement made before the police, had claimed he had seen Rocky very disturbed at his residence on the evening of May 7 and that his father Bindi Yadav had facilitated his escape.
  
  In the court, the constable flatly denied having made any such statement. Tej Narain is the sixth witness in the case to turn hostile. Earlier all five witnesses, including four friends of Aditya Sachdeva, had turned hostile. Public prosecutor S D N Singh was changed after five witnesses turned hostile. He has been replaced by  .
  
  Putting up a brave face, public prosecutor Sartaj Ali Khan said there was strong scientific evidence, including a perfect match between the Bretta pistol belonging to Yadav and the bullet recovered from the victim’s body, against Rocky. “CCTV footages also establish Rocky’s presence in Gaya on the day of incident,” said the PP.
  
  
    on Friday adjourned the hearing in the much-publicised road rage case by two weeks. The state government had earlier challenged the bail granted to Rocky by the Patna high court. In October last year, the apex court had stayed the bail granted to Rocky and sent him back to Gaya central jail. The matter came up before the bench comprising Justice   and Justice L N Rao. Gopal Singh, Bihar government’s counsel in the apex court, said the court would now hear the case after two weeks.
