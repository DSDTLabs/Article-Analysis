TRICHY: Continuing its crackdown against encroachments marring the architectural beauty of the 156 acre large   temple in  ,   and   (HR&CE) department has sealed as many as 15 shops that were functioning within the eight temple towers (gopurams). With this, HR&CE said that all the encroachments on the temple premises covering 21 gopurams have been removed. 

 After completing the drive on Saturday, officials added that similar action would be taken against shops that encroached temple's space in 16 pillar mandapam and four-pillar mandapams situated in front of the Rajagopuram.
 
 According to the HR&CE sources, the department had been repeatedly instructing shopkeepers to vacate the encroached spaces where stalls, based on an agreement with the temple administration, were operated within the entrances of eight towers dotting the main temple complex.
 
  "Visitors to the shops established within the passage of towers around the temple were causing inconvenience to the pilgrims," joint commissioner of HR&CE, Srirangam, P   said.
