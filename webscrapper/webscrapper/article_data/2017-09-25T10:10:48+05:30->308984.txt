PUNE: The district consumer court has held that an   firm cannot be held liable for deficient service if a policy holder fails to promptly intimate the insurer, in writing, about theft or loss of insured property.

 The bench of V P Utpat and   dismissed a consumer complaint filed by   resident, which wished to claim Rs 5.42 lakh towards stolen machinery and Rs 1.8 lakh in  ,000 cost from a bank and an insurance company .
 
 “The complainant has failed to produce any cogent documentary evidence to corroborate the fact that intimation as regards to theft of insured property was promptly given to the insurance company .There is no record produced by him to show that the insurance company had repudiated the claim. Hence, this forum holds that the present consumer complaint is premature and deserves to be dismissed,“ the bench said.
 
 Referring to the case against the bank, the bench observed that the consumer complaint was not maintainable as the bank had no connection with the insurance of the stolen machinery .
 
 “As per terms and conditions in the insurance policy, it was incumbent upon the complainant to intimate the insurance company about loss of insured property immediately , in writing,“ the bench held.
