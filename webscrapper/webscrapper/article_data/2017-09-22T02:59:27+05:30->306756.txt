NEW DELHI: Both Rocky   and his organisation, the National Students’ Union of India, vehemently denied any wrongdoing or manipulation of facts while filing his nomination for president of DUSU. ABVP has alleged that Tuseed hid the fact he was facing a criminal case while also violating academic norms for poll candidates.

  claimed on Thursday that because ABVP was unable to digest the loss, it had brought charges that have “no chance of holding up in court”. Tuseed claimed that there was neither a criminal case against him nor a trial going on. 
 
 One of his friends said, “The case in Shivaji College involved Rocky’s supporters who got into a scuffle. Rocky was not on the scene, but he was named in the FIR under Section 34 of Indian Penal Code, which is for group liability.”
 
 Also, while SB Babbar, chief election officer, DU, said his nomination had initially been cancelled on the basis of the disciplinary action he faced in Shivaji College, NSUI office bearers insisted that no official disciplinary committee had probed the charges and the only “action” taken had been a verbal warning to Tuseed.
 
 As for his name being variously spelt in the documents he had submitted for admission to the department of Buddhist Studies, the DUSU presidential winner claimed that he had applied to a court for a change in name, but the plea had not been accepted. Tuseed also maintained that he had not hidden details of his academic record in the application form for the master’s course in Buddhist Studies. “I had not completed my earlier course and so cancelled my name midway. The application form asked for the roll number of the previous academic degree, which was at Shivaji College, and that is what I submitted,” he told TOI.
 
 NSUI cadres put their weight behind Tuseed. “Here was a student who won the elections after he was given only one Saturday to campaign. ABVP is not able to digest it,” said a supporter.
