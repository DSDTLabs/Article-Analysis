Before Ayodhya assembly constituency goes to polls on Monday,   has sent there hundreds of its work , ers to ensure it wins the seat. The small town with a population of less then 5 lakh has been a hub of the saffron brigade since late 1980s and more so after the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1991. This seat remained with BJP but in 2012 assembly election it went to Samajwadi Party , the party that is known to have been against the Ram Mandir movement.

 To regain the lost prestige,   has taken charge of campaigning.For the last about a week, RSS ideologues have been visiting Ayodhya, meeting the influential people and trying to get them to help regain the seat. Among the list of RSS leaders visiting were Krishna Gopal , Ram Lal--the RSS man in BJP (general secretary organisation)--organisation in charge Anupam Ji and several others. Saturday onwards, hundreds of RSS full-timers from different `prants' have been deputed at Ayodhya seat, said sources. Talking to TOI, RSS supporter Dr Prem Prakash Pandey said, “Ayodhya is a prestige issue for RSS and regaining the seat will be their greatest achievement.“ Krishna Gopal held a closed-door meeting with supporters in Faizabad. “Since BJP has given the ticket to an outsider, he is facing resentment from the cadre and we are trying to pacify them,“ said Prem Prakash Soni, a trader. 
 
 “This question has often been raised about Sangh always trying to maintain an identity different from the BJP but actually it is taking all crucial decisions in Uttar Pradesh election,“ said Vikas, a young trader.
 
 Talking to TOI, RSS district convenor Paritosh said, "I am here to organise `shakhas' and our workers are on the job to win Ayodhya."
