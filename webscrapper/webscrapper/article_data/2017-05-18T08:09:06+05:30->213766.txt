GURUGRAM: A 15-member delegation from Afghanistan visited the city on Wednesday to study the   programme under the state government’s   in Gurgaon, in which 2,200 children between the ages of 0-2 years, and around 600 pregnant women are being vaccinated.

 The team sought to study how the immunization programme is being managed through the mother-child protection (MCP) card in  . The delegation, including two Unicef workers from Japan, visited the primary health centre and General Hospital in  .
 
 Under Mission Indradhanush, each woman is issued an MCP card by the health authorities, when she gets pregnant. The card keeps a record of shots and medicines given to expecting women during pregnancy and also after delivery. Once the child is born, his/her details are also included in the card, through which the infant’s immunization can be tracked. 
 
 The delegation observed the MCP cards are made at the post-partum centre of General Hospital in Civil Lines, while its twin is kept with the ANM for tracking.
 
 A delegate shared how the immunization in Afghanistan is not very organised, nor is there any card to monitor who has been administered what vaccines. The team collected samples of the card and vaccination model till the age of 16 years. The delegates said they would recommend a similar card system for their country, even though the one in Haryana has too many pages, they pointed out.
