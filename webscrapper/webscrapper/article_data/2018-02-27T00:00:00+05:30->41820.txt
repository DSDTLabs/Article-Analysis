 plays a visually-challenged man in  , and to get into the skin of the character, he spent 15 days in a hostel for the visually-challenged in Mysuru, observing their body language and how they go about their everyday activities. This is why the makers thought it was apt that they feature actual visually-challenged people in the   song — that releases online tomorrow — which is a peppy number that gives us an insight in their everyday lives.

 Speaking about the song, director   says, “Before filming began, Vijay and I spent 15 days observing the visually-challenged. This included everything from how they walk and talk to how they cross the road. We then approached   to pen the lyrics for the song that is all about their everyday, routine lives. So, in the song, you will see the visually-challenged playing chess, carom and cards (all of which are specially designed for them), and even play the harmonium and tabla. The song features close to 100 visually-challenged people, who diligently trained for a week at choreographer Kalai Master’s dance studio before the actual shoot. The song itself was canned in four days.”
 
 Despite the week-long rehearsals, there were some challenges that the team had to face during the filming. “Since they didn’t know where the camera was, they would sometimes turn in the wrong direction when we called ‘action’. They had to be led by hand and shown where to stand and which way to turn. But they were quick to pick up instructions, so that made shooting easier,” says Sukesh.
 
 The director couldn’t be happier with the outcome and the feedback that he got from his visually-challenged actors was reassuring. “Generally, people only sympathize with them, which they don’t like. This is why they told me that they were happy that audiences will get to see how they lead their lives through this peppy song.”
