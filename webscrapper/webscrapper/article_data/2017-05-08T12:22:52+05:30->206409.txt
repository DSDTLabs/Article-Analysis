DAMMAM: There is a saying that in any corner of the world one would find a Malayali. The grocery run by Rajeev , a Malayali from  , in the   of  , on the  , stands testimony to this saying. Around twenty-five Iraqi families, who had migrated to the kingdom during the first Gulf War reside in this settlement.

 More than thousand Iraqi families had arrived from Iraq to Saudi during the war. As the Saudi government sanc tioned citizenship, many of them moved to other towns. For the remaining ones in the desert, the government arranged small cottages and schools.
 
 Neither Rajeev's shop nor the houses here have air conditioners. Air coolers are the only kind of luxury available in the area. The Iraqis in the village work as shepherds as they do not have legal documents to travel to distant places, said Rajeev. Once they get legal status, they might leave the place in search of better jobs, he added.
