While  , indulgence and gift-giving are what, many believe, make the Yuletide festivities merry, it’s the selfless giving that’s at the heart of Christmas. Taking cue from the message of the season, the city-based ResQ Charitable Trust, that works towards the rescue and rehabilitation of animals, will vaccinate a minimum of 500 stray dogs today.

 Neha Panchamiya, founder president of ResQ, says, “Teams comprising vets, handlers, dog catchers and volunteers will be in six localities across the city from dawn. We’re targetting a minimum of 500 dogs, and we don't intend to call it a day till we meet our goal.” 
 
 
 
 The organisation will be covering areas including Aundh, Range Hills, Koregaon Park, Undri, Bavdhan and Pimpri, among others. Based on their records, densely-populated localities with more chances for human-animal conflict, or those with a past of large numbers of rabid animals found, have been chosen. “The focus is on the number of animals being targetted. Our team of volunteers and vets will be carrying over 1000 vaccine injections, so we hope to vaccinate more than 500 dogs.” Besides this, they will be putting elasto-reflective safety collars on the dogs to reduce the occurrence of animal road accidents at night.
 
 
 
 If this has already inspired you, the organisation is also setting up a dog   stall at E-Square ( ), where people can support the cause by bringing stray   for vaccination. “The puppies will be given a 7-in-1 vaccine, which provides protection against serious health risks, including distemper, hepatitis and parvovirus which are often fatal,” says Neha.
