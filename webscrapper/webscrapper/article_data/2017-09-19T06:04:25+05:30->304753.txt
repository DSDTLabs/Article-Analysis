BENGALURU: In a major development, the Special Investigation Team probing the   Lankesh murder case recalled its personnel interacting with former   and others in Naxalaffected areas of Dakshina Kannada,   and   districts.

 Besides deploying its own personnel, the SIT had roped in sleuths from the   (CCB) of Bengaluru police, Anti-Naxal Force (ANF) and civil police of Udupi and Chikkamagaluru districts.
 
 However, highly placed police sources said SIT per sonnel have not come across any strong evidence to establish the involvement of Naxals in Gauri's killing. Gauri was involved in get ting many Naxal activists to give up arms.
 
 "The teams will return in a day or two. We have interacted with every possible person who was, in one way or another, connected with Naxal activities and Gauri Lankesh. We found some Naxal heads were unhappy with her as she had succeeded in bringing seven of their comrades back to the mainstream. But the disagreement doesn't appear to have escalated to the level of killing her," a police officer said.
 
 However, another officer said SIT will probe all possible angles. "We may lessen the focus but will never stop probing the Naxal angle," he said.
