PUNE: The city could soon get a 2,300km network of   cables (OFC), thanks to a new Pune Municipal Corporation policy. 

 The proposal has been tabled for approval before the standing committee, which will take a decision on Monday. 
 
 According to a civic official, the network will benefit citizens in the form of free   services, while saving the administration money in the form of broadband fees. In fact, the network will become a revenue source, official said. 
 
 “The roads are dug up many times for different service providers. That can be avoided once the OFC network is ready,” said municipal commissioner  .
 
  
  
 As per the proposal, this will be a shared network, which will be available to private Internet service providers. Government agencies such as Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited and BSNL will be able to use the facilities created by the network. They will be asked to lay out their requirements for the next five years.
 
 Civic officials have planned a number of Internet-based facilities to make civic services more reliable. The network will provide high-speed Internet for paperless building permissions, GPS tagging and monitoring of properties,   of trees, centralized traffic management, CCTV network, smart street-lighting and centralized control rooms. 
 
 Per estimates, PMC currently annually spends around Rs60 crore on broadband and other Internet services, obtained from service providers. The cost will increase, with an increase in Internet-based services planned by PMC. 
 
 As per civic administration estimates, if all-new online systems are installed, it will spend around Rs3,000 crore over the next 15 years. If broadband services are provided using the network, the PMC stands to earn as much as Rs 5,000 crore over the next decade.
