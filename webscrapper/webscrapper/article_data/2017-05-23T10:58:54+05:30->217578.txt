KANPUR: In yet another twist, parents of   aka ' ', who had created ripples by kidnapping her lover on gun-point from a marriage pandal during his wedding with another girl at   town in   district, announced to disown her, saying that their daughter had brought embarrassment to family. Earlier, the father of Varsha's lover   had announced to disown him for refusing to tie knot with a girl proposed by him and humiliation which the family faced. 

 Varsha's mother said, "Our daughter landed us in trouble. She chose to walk out. We do not know where she is and have nothing to do with her any more. We had to be on the run for past few days till the matter was settled on Saturday as police were making rounds of our house. We were constantly being questioned about Varsha and Ashok's whereabouts. Varsha had left the house on May 15, saying that she will return home soon. We had no idea of the affair nor did we approve of it. Ashok was already married and has two children."
 
 Speaking to TOI over phone from Banda, Varsha said now she has made her marriage a prestige issue. 
 
 "The police have not yet released Ashok saying that there is still a complaint against him. The matter has not yet been resolved as the parents of Bharti, with whom Ashok solemnised the marriage on May 5, are demanding to compensation. My parents say it has brought them bad name. But Ashok and I are happy and now we will not go back to our homes," she said.
 
 SHO Maudaha Kotwali AK Singh said, "Except a complaint from Bharti's parents, there is no case pending against Ashok. After he deposed in court of CJM in favour of Varsha, there was nothing left to be done. If Ashok failed to reach a compromise with Bharti's parents, then we would have to initiate action and book him as per law." 
 
 Singh told TOI that Varsha is staying at her friend Rahul's house in Banda. "If the matter does not settle, then we would send Ashok to jail and Varsha to nari niketan," he added.
