HYDERABAD: The landmark decision to demonetise Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes will soon be part of the syllabus for   students. 

  Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) is mulling including   and its aftermath as well as the move towards Goods and   (GST) in textbooks. This will be done after an internal review of all textbooks (Class I to XII) aimed at keeping children updated on recent developments in the country.
 
 Teachers and parents in the city have lauded the move, saying it would improve financial literacy among kids.
 
 “Contemporizing education is always a good idea as it keeps children up-to-date with the happenings in the country. Including topics like demonetization and GST will improve their financial literacy,” said  , principal of P Obul Reddy Public School. She said though that schools have not yet received any circular about the syllabus upgrade.
 
 Others felt that these topics should be included only in the higher classes. “Topics related to financial literacy should be added in class nine or ten as these students have already been introduced to economics and know the basics. For other children, these topics can be alien and a bit hard to grasp,” said   P, a teacher at a CBSE-affiliated school.
 
 Many parents, however, expressed apprehension that students might get a one-sided story if the government gives a biased version of topics.
