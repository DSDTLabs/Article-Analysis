Padmashree Bharat   who is always known for his compassion and benevolence once again melted the hearts of his fans today by visiting an 'ammoomma' fan and making her wish true. 

 Posting some candid moments with her, the actor wrote on his page, "Happen to see a video where in I saw this Amma expressing her wish to meet me. Today morning I visited her and spend some time with her (sic)" 
 
 
 Earlier the actor had met his ardent fan   from Poland during a function at Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology (MBCET) in Thiruvananthapuram. The wheel-chair bound Czarnotta had written on his Facebook page after meeting Mohanlal,"I am not able to express how grateful I am. Thank you, Sir, for your kindness and attention towards me. I would like to express my gratefulness to His Beatitude Moran Mor Baselios Cardinal Cleemis for his extremly touching words (sic)."
