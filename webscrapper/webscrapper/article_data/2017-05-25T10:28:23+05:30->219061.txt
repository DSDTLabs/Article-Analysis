MADURAI: BJP is   in   and will prove it in the ensuing  , said state BJP leader  .

 She spoke to mediapersons after conducting the district level cadres meet in Madurai on Wednesday. “Don’t just continue to say that we are weak in Tamil Nadu, because we are gaining a foothold in the state,” she said. BJP has provided corruption free governance at the Centre for the last three years unlike the Tamil Nadu government which has been filled with corruption, she said.
 
 Pointing out that BJP would not form an alliance with a party like DMK which was mired by corruption and scams, Tamilisai said that DMK was doing great injustice to DMK leader M Karunanidhi by being partial in extending invitations for his birthday celebration. “Kalaignar was a person who maintained cordial relations with all political leaders and would have definitely invited all of them for this great moment, had he been fit,” she said.
 
 Commenting on Naam Tamilar Katchi leader Seeman’s statement that actor Rajanikanth should stay away from politics, she said that Seeman was going beyond limits while making statements and criticising leaders of other parties.
 
 The statements of various political leaders from Tamil Nadu, including S Thirunavukkarasar and Thirumavalavan over the Chief Minister Edapaddi Palaniswami meeting the Prime Minister was uncalled for and it showed that they were not committed to solving the problems of the people of the state, she said. 
 
 BJP was committed to providing Tamil Nadu many developmental projects and the chief minister may have met the prime minister to seek more projects for the state, she added.
