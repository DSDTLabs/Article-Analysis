BENGALURU: The state government has mooted an ambitious plan to introduce a hi-tech monitoring system to check   and control law and order situations by installing sophisticated speed dome cameras and the more advanced automatic number plate reader cameras at vantage points in the city.

 The plan also includes new smart video software analytic for the CCTV cameras that will arm them with a degree of artificial intelligence.
 
 The futuristic zero tolerance traffic project will be implemented with the aim of raising the standards of traffic policing using technology, using Central funds under the Smart City project, provided Bengaluru makes it to the list in the final round in March. BBMP’s smart city cell had recently made a power-point presentation of zero tolerance traffic project before senior police officers and Bengaluru development minister K J George, who was reportedly impressed.
 
 A senior police officer, who was present at the meeting, said the issues related to enhancing police visibility and strengthening surveillance system were discussed at length in the meeting. “This will be very useful in managing traffic violations,” the officer said, adding that installation of high-powered cameras was also likely to change the way motorists behave as they would know that eyes of the camera are watching them,” he said.
 
 In his presentation, Muralidhara Turevekere, nodal officer, said, “Motorists can be issued a smart card or e-number plate with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) microchip that will store data related to the car owner, including registration details, chassis number and RTO details of past offences. It can be scanned using chip readers from a distance of up to 300 feet and will help in monitoring cars that are speeding, breaking traffic rules, or violating pollution control norms.”
 
 The advanced automatic number plate reader can help track offences like speeding or zebra line overshooting. “It will also help in tracing stolen vehicles by identifying the number plate and sending information if it’s moving on road,” Muralidhara said.
 
 The cameras can also help in controlling law and order situations and crime. According to inputs the cameras are fed, they can zoom in on a situation where the camera recognizes more than a certain number of people running in a particular direction and identify the situation as a crisis such as a fire or a riot, and send information to the control room.
 
 This project, if successful, can reduce the number of traffic police personnel on the streets as the entire city can be monitored from the control room. Even in cases when traffic violations are identified, the address of the motorist can be acquired by zooming in on his number plate and checking the registration, following which a challan can be sent to his home.
