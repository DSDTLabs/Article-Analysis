At a time when debates on whether or not to allow fireworks and elephants at   are on, actor  , who hails from Thrissur, says he would love to have both at the festival, after ensuring that safety guidelines are followed.

 The 'Ezra' actor wrote on his social networking page recently, "One of the reasons for me to be proud of being a Thrissurkaran is our world-renowned pooram. The procession of majestic elephants and vibrant fireworks make it the elegant affair that it is. Instead of wiping off the tradition completely, I believe that it is better to take sufficient precautions and safeguard our beautiful culture. Let Thrissur Pooram continue to be how it always was."
 
 He also added a line about holding hartals for this cause, "Hartals have never helped in bringing any quality changes to our State and therefore, I don't believe in this mode of protest. It's time that we change the way we revolt."
