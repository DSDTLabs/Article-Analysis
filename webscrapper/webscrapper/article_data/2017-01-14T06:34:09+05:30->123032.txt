KOLKATA: Overweight constables, waddling clumsily with a stick, pulling their trousers up to prevent them from sliding from under their bellies have been as much a part of the Kolkata canvas as political agitations. But it’s time, it seems, for Kolkata   to tighten their belts and pull that paunch in. 

 In response to a PIL filed earlier this week, a high court division bench on Friday asked the state government to prepare and submit a report on the ‘physical and mental fitness’ of Kolkata policemen. 
 
 Once likened to the  , the city police force has indeed left much to be desired in terms of their physical attributes, which weren’t exactly conducive to chasing criminals, the court observed. 
 
 The report has to be ready within four weeks.
 
 Over the years, they have been made fun of, chided for being slow and unfit and taken to be a symbol of the sloppy administration that they represent. It has been alleged that they have been allowed to grow out of size and never trained to be disciplined and athletic.  , critics say, is harsher on passers-by than goons and criminals who create trouble. 
 
 It could be a tall order to introduce a culture of fitness in the police force, admit the men in white. Some point fingers at the Bengali aversion to physical activities. 
 
 “We are lazy by nature and lose the motivation to keep in shape. As policemen get older and rise in rank, they tend to stay away from action. By the time they turn 40, their physique turns irretrievable. But it’s never too late to change,” said a retired cop.
 
 This is one change that will probably not make the city rise up in protest.
