KOCHI: A brief scuffle between police and a few youths in Kochi led to the transfer of a  . The drama unfolded after a patrol team led by Ernakulam South SI Vipin AC took three youths into custody around 9.30 pm near Kochukadavanthra on Saturday. 

 Upendrajith, Vignesh from Thrikkakara and Ayyappa Swaroop from Kadavanthra were in a car when the police team approached them for a sobriety test.
 
 The three youths alleged that the officer had harassed them.   ( ) chairman K Narayana Kurup, who came to know about the incident, promptly visited the station on Saturday night and found the trio stripped to their undergarments. Kurup, who interacted with the youths inside the lock up, directed the police to produce them for a medical examination. “Their arrest was unnecessary. Police said they were picked up for drinking in public and then they changed the charges to assaulting a police officer on duty,“ said Kurup, adding that stripping the youths amounted to gross violation of Constitutional and human rights.
 
 KSPCA sources said that on finding that the person behind the wheel was sober, the SI asked for the vehicle's registra tion documents. “The youths picked up an argument with the officer and he took them into custody eventually,“ said sources.
 
 “The police have no right to take them into custody and harass them,“ Kurup added.
 
 Meanwhile, Ernakulam MLA Hibi Eden and a few   activists staged a protest in front of the station against the police atrocity. The inspector said that the youths were picked after residents complained about nuisance. “They assaulted me while I was in uniform and tore away my nameplate,“ alleged the officer. The officer has been transferred to city police headquarters pending investigation, said sources.
