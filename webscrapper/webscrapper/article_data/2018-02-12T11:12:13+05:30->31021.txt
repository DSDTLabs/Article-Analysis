VIJAYAWADA: A new diet plan formulated by a charted accountant, and which promises to control   and aid weight loss, has become a rage in the capital region, and spreading across the state. 

 Doctors are, however, divided over the effectiveness of the plan. 
 
 Veeramachineni Ramakrishna, who is a CA by profession, has come up with the diet plan. The ‘low-carbohydrate and rich-fat’ diet suggested by him has spread, mainly through word of mouth, across large sections of the population, with many swearing by its positive results. Many people are suggesting it to their friends and relatives. A YouTube video by Ramakrishna has garnered millions of hits. 
 
 The 49-year-old Ramakrishna used to weigh 120 kg about a year ago. He, along with his friend, after trying many things to reduce weight, came up with the ‘low-carb, high-fat’ food. Ramakrishna says he successfully shed 30 kg in a span of two months. Ramakrishna’s friend, who refused to be named, is 58 and a diabetic. The friend says his   levels have come down to normal after following the plan.
 
 The results boosted their confidence. Ramakrishna says both held a meeting with their close friends, and explained their experiment, and the results they got from it. They asked for volunteers to come forward, and asked them to come back after 15 days after following the diet. All the members who adopted the diet came up with positive results. From there, the word started spreading in the city.
 
 Ramakrishna started spreading the word within his circle of friends and family, and received positive feedback from everyone. In the process, his speeches were uploaded in YouTube, which have become viral. Now, Ramakrishna is touring across the two Telugu states explaining the benefits of the diet.
