PATNA: The Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) has rented two sewer suction machines from a Haryana-based firm at a cost of Rs 8,000 per hour for clearing blockages in underground drainage lines.

 “Our workers are expected to use the two machines from April 25. While the big one with higher capacity will clean underground drains on wide roads in 75 wards, the small one will be used to de-silt drains in narrow lanes, covering low-lying areas like Bakerganj, Thakurbari Road, Nala Road and Kankerbagh, among others,” PMC deputy commissioner Vishal Anand said on Monday and added the city would not face any major waterlogging issue this year.
 
 According to sources, the PMC has set a target of cleaning more than 500 small and big drains across the city in two months. Hence, officials of various circles, including New Capital, Pataliputra, Bankipore and Patna City, have provided a list of drains in their respective areas to the civic body.
 
 There are two ways of cleaning manholes and catchpits — manually or by using sewer suction machines. With the two rented machines, the PMC expects to temporarily do away with the manual practice of taking out silt and waste materials from drains.
 
 Patna mayor Sita Sahu said the manual cleaning of drains, which began on April 1, would be completed in three months. “In the annual PMC budget (2018-19), a sum of Rs 50 lakh was allocated for the purchase of safety equipment and uniforms for municipal workers. We, accordingly, provided gloves, gumboots, helmets and even oxygen masks to the workers engaged in cleaning 10-feet deep chambers in order to ensure their safety,” she told this reporter.
 
 Two PMC workers had died of suffocation while cleaning a sewer line at the I-T roundabout in May last year.
