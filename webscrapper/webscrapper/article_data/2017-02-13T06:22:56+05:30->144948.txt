BENGALURU: It's almost a month since   in   was shut down after a portion of its wall collapsed, but there's no indication as to when the mall will be reopened. 

 BBMP commissioner   said the occupancy certificate will be issued to the mall authorities only after they comply with recommendations made by the expert committee on strengthening the beams, improving structural stability and other issues pertaining to the multi-storey structure. 
 
  Prasad, who is also head of the committee, said they haven't fixed any deadline for the compliance report. 
 
  "It's left to the mall authorities to set things right. We have given them the committee report with details on what needs to be done. So far, we haven't got any reply from them. Till the compliance is done, the mall won't be allowed to operate," he added. 
 
  Two persons were injured when a part of the wall collapsed on January 16. A day later, the BBMP formed an expert committee to conduct an inquiry into the incident and submit a report in 15 days. The committee, with technica l experts like Radhakrishna, associate professor,   and K S Jayasimha, R Nagendra and M S Sudarshan, from  , recently collected samples from the mall to analyze the structural stability. The report said seepage of water into the walls from the AC duct led to the collapse. 
 
 A spokesperson from Mantri Developers said they will comment on the renovation later because the people concerned are out of town.
