PATNA: A Bihar Police inspector has been suspended for allegedly sharing a derogatory post about Prime Minister   with a WhatsApp group.

  range’s officiating DIG Vikas Vaibhav ordered the suspension of Mohd Islam on Tuesday after   Meenu Kumari submitted a report to the DIG against the 57-year-old.
 
 “The inspector shared a morphed picture of  , showing him shaking hands with terror outfit Laskhar-e-Taiba’s chief  . The PM was called a traitor in the picture,” the DIG told TOI over the phone on Wednesday, adding departmental proceedings would be initiated against the suspended officer.
 
 The DIG said the Khagaria SP had received a complaint about the inspector on January 5. “The act seemed intentional as the forwarded message was not deleted by the officer; nor did he share any apology with the group,” Viabhav said and added legal opinion was being sought by the SP on whether any legal action could be initiated against the inspector.
 
 According to the Khagaria SP, the complaint to her was made by a district   worker, Alok Kumar Vidyarthi, who was also a member of the WhatApp group called ‘Udyog Prakoshth’. “Sadar SDPO Ramanand Sagar inquired into the complaint and found it true,” the SP said.
 
 She said the inspector told the SDPO during the inquiry that his grandson had shared the post inadvertently. “His explanation was not found satisfactory,” the SP said and added the inspector’s act was against the service rules of Bihar Police. The SP said Islam had joined police as a sub-inspector and was later promoted to the rank of inspector. “On the verge of retirement, he was transferred to Bagaha on January 1 for his final posting.”
