NAGPUR: After landslide victory in the recent civic elections, BJP has convened first   (NMC) general body meeting of the new House on March 20. In the meeting, NMC has restarted the process to hike fire charges recovered during building plan sanction two to four times.

 The fire department has submitted a proposal to this effect for the general body. Besides, the civic administration has also submitted a proposal to revise water tax.
 
 Total 10 proposals will come up for discussion at the general body meeting next Monday. The proposal to hike fire charges was approved by the standing committee in November last year even though the NMC's fire and emergency services department had already hiked the charges in 2011-12 fiscal. The revised charges were in effect till financial year 2015-16.
 
 As the revised fire charges did not have approval of the general body and the state government, a builder in the city had challenged the increased tax in the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court. HC had then asked NMC to roll back the charges.
 
 The fire department’s revenue had increased from Rs1.54 crore to Rs7.44 crore when charges were revised. With the money, the department had planned to strengthen its fire safety and preventive system by purchasing turn table ladder and other machinery. It lacks machinery to tackle fire in high rise buildings. The department has now started the process anew to hike charges.
 
 Fire charge is levied in 10 categories. As per the proposal, the charges for residential buildings or flat schemes will rise from Rs4 to Rs12 per sq m for buildings that are 15-24 metre high, from Rs6 to Rs18 per sq m for buildings 24- 35 metre high, and from Rs12 to Rs48 per sq m for buildings above 45 metres. Similarly, revisions will take place in educational, commercial and other categories. NMC will also restart levying 1% annual fee for renewing fire fitness certificate.
 
 Sources in fire department told TOI that after the proposal gets approval from GB, it will be implemented only after the nod from state’s urban development department in Mumbai.
 
 Other proposals to be tabled before the house include nomination of three Congress corporators in the 16-member standing committee, nomination of one corporator as trustee of  , formation of 13-member transport committee and nomination of two corporators as directors into special purpose vehicle formed for implementing Smart City Project.
