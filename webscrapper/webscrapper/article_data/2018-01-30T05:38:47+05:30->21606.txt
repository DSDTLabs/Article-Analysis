KOLKATA: Students of Calcutta University of various political hues on Monday protested against the BA and BSc (honours and general) Part I results that showed a large number of unsuccessful candidates.

 The dharna, which started around 12 noon on the College Street campus, gained momentum as the demonstrators tried to barge inside the main administrative building. A huge police force had to be deployed to control the situation. 
 
  (DSO) led the agitation. It put forth several demands before the CU officials. State committee member of   Debu   said, “We demand rechecking of answer scripts, a thorough investigation into the result fiasco, publishing of incomplete results and reinstatement of the 2009 regulations.”
 
 Education minister Partha Chatterjee expressed disgust at “outsiders’” attempts to create trouble on the CU campus.
