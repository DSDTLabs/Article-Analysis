Actor Michael   says being a father is the most significant responsibility of his life. The 42-year-old star, who is father to two girls   and  , says making sure he is fulfilling his job as a parent is the most important part of his life and he often puts his family above his work. 

  
  
 "The responsibility that holds the most significance in my life is being a father. So, honestly, lots of those moments don't happen on set. They happen in those brief periods where I actually get to go home and take the kids to school, pick them up, cook them dinner and put them to bed," Shannon says. 
 
 He adds, "I don't really mind (playing small roles). The smaller the part, the quicker I get home to my kids. That's the way I look at it. I'm more nervous about taking the big job and being away for a long time."
