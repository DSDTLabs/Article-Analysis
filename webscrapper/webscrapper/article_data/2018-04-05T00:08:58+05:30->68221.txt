New Delhi: A day after settling a defamation case against BJP leader Arun Jaitley, chief minister Arvind   on Wednesday   quashing of another criminal defamation case   by  ,   of former CM  .

 However, in Khera’s case Kejriwal has not apologised, and instead questioned the complainant’s locus to file the defamation case when it was not even directed against him.
 
 In his plea filed in the Delhi high court, Kejriwal also sought   of the summoning order of January 2013 and subsequent proceedings in the matter, urging the court to end the case pending in a Patiala House court.
 
 Dikshit’s political secretary had filed the defamation case over Kejriwal’s alleged remarks against her during power tariff hike protests in October 2012. In 2013 the trial court had said that prima facie defamation charges are made out against Kejriwal and put him on trial after he pleaded not guilty.
 
 Khera, who was officer on special duty and political secretary to Dikshit, had filed the defamation case against Kejriwal saying he had used “false and filthy” language against the chief minister in a television show.
 
 While pleading not guilty, Kejriwal had argued that Khera is not an aggrieved person and the complaint against him is false. “The complainant is not an aggrieved person and has no locus standi to file this complaint. The complainant is not a member of the Congress party nor he has disclosed in clear terms his relationship with Dikshit. There are proofs available in public domain showing that electricity distribution companies were given unexplainable benefits,” Kejriwal had earlier said in his defence.
