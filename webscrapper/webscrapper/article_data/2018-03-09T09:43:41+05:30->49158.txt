JHUNJHUNU: Thanks to their daughters, about 200 women from   district got an opportunity to interact with Prime Minister   on Thursday.

 These women, all under 30 years, had opted for family planning after giving birth to one girl or two, and were selected to meet   for the pan-India launch of the   Beti Padhao (BBBP) programme. The PM spent 10 minutes interacting with them and playing with the children.
 
 “I am so proud of my daughter and glad that I made this decision. It is because of her that PM chose to meet me. No son can give me what my daughter has given me today,” said Pooja Kumari, whose only daughter was 17 months old.
 
 Modi asked them about the plans for their daughters and gifted teddy bears to the children. A group of girls danced, bringing a smile to PM’s face. “He played with them just as we play with babies. I will keep this teddy and give it to my daughter only when she grows up,” said Pooja.
 
 Modi asked her if she would let her daughter contest elections or play sports. “I told him that my daughter can be what she wants – a politician or a sportswoman,” she added.
 
 He was also seen spending some time with a two-year-old, the daughter of 25-year-old Priyanka Devi.
 
 During his address after the session, Modi said, “I asked the mothers if their relatives had distributed sweets during the birth of their daughters. They said that they had no idea. But they had themselves celebrated the birth of their daughters.”
