MANDYA: Putting to rest rumours that he may return to Congress, former chief minister   has started chalking the party's strategy in Mandya. He has urged the   to give a ticket to   to contest from the   assembly segment.

 
 The former JD(S) leader switched loyalties at a function in Bengaluru on Saturday after he was denied a ticket by the party. BJP which is keen to make inroads in Mandya, feels Shivanna, who enjoys huge popularity in rural Mandya, will put up a tough fight against likely Congress candidate, M H Ambareesh.
 
 Earlier, there were reports that 'Five Rupee' doctor S C Shankaregowda would join the BJP and be their candidate. However, Shankaregowda is still optimistic that he will get a JD(S) ticket.
 
 Chandagalu Shivanna is an incumbent zilla panchayat member. He contested the ZP poll as a rebel JD(S) candidate when he was denied a ticket, only to return to the JD(S) later.
