RAJKOT:   ( )’s standing committee will decide on Thursday on the proposal to widen the railway station road by demolishing private shops and government structures.

 RMC has sent the proposal to standing committee to declare railway station road as public street and widen the road to 60-feet from current 48-feet. If this proposal is approved, the 2km road will witness demolition of 17 shops, railway employees quarters and   Boarding. 
 
 The proposal states that since railway station area is very congested, it needs to be cleaned up. In 2006, the civic body had demolished 84 shops on this road and traders had protested for nearly two months. At that time, RMC’s decision was considered to be controversial and this time too it is considered as a sensitive one.
