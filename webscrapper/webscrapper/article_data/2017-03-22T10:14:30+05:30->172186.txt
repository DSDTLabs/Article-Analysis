HYDERABAD: Coming down heavily on a local   for not letting a customer withdraw money from her savings account, a district consumer forum here has directed its managing committee to refund about Rs 4.25 lakh and pay compensation of Rs 50,000.

 P Alivelamma joined the  , a registered cooperative society, by depositing a cumulative amount of Rs 2, 96,086. She was given membership up to December 31, 2011. However, on realising that there is mismanagement in the society, she demanded the society and its managing committee to refund the amount.
 
 “As far as the savings account is concerned, the society is liable to pay interest at 12% per annum. So totally, I had to get more than Rs 4.2 lakh. In spite of my repeated demands, they did not repay the amount and expressed their inability to refund as the previous managing committee of the   had mismanaged and misappropriated the funds,“ said Alivelamma before the forum. The opposite parties in their written version said that there is a court order restraining them from alienating the immovable property situated at  , which is bought by the previous management and until the said order is vacated, they will not be in a position to clear amounts.
 
 During the trial, the bench said, “It is the bounden duty of the opposite parties to refund the amount to its members who have deposited the amount in good faith. The opposite parties cannot take shelter under the fact that their previous managing committee defrauded the society.“
