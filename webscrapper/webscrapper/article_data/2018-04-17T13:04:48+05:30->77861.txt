PATNA: Incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s wife and former Bihar CM   on Monday agreed to take back the BMP-2 personnel as security guards at her 10, Circular Road residence, ending a weeklong row over their withdrawal. A close aide of Lalu family told TOI the matter finally settled after intervention of a senior official from Bihar police headquarters, who called Rabri and got the issue sorted out.

 The 17 BMP-2 jawans were withdrawn by the state police headquarters on April 10 night on the plea that they were deployed for Lalu’s security. Since he was in jail in the fodder scam cases and undergoing treatment at AIIMS Delhi, his BMP-2 security guards were withdrawn. An angry Rabri wrote a letter to the CM on April 11 informing that she was returning all security personnel and escort vehicles deployed at her residence.
 
 Later, CM ordered restoration of the security on April 12, but she refused to accept them and the jawans were forced to stay in tents outside her residence.
 
 Rabri had shot off a second letter on this matter to CM   on Sunday asking “why the police officials did not pick up the repetitive calls made by former deputy CM Tejaswi Prasad Yadav and former minister   (after removal of security guards on April 10)?” 
 
 She has also cautioned the home department and its minister in charge, who is Nitish, would be held responsible in case of any untoward incident with her family.
 
 She alleged in her letter that the state government is conspiring to kill her family. “RJD leader   even wrote several letters to the home department, seeking the reply on removal of Z-plus category security. But they haven’t given any reply so far,” Rabri wrote in the letter.
