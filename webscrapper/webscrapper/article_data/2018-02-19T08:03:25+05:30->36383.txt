 Police had to resort to lathicharge to disperse the mob of hostellers pelting stones at the shopkeepers.
 
 Police have nabbed the shopkeeper Ghamandi Singh while the injured hosteller Anurag has been admitted to Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital. Around two hours after the incident, when the hostellers came to know about the incident, scores of them reached the tea vendor’s stand and started searching for the vendor. Not able to find the vendor, the students started pelting stones at other shops.
 
 Later, they attacked the two-wheelers and four wheelers parked in front of the railway station and damaged over half-a-dozen vehicles.
 
 Circle officer Alok Mishra said, “Singh has been arrested for attacking the student while an FIR has also been lodged against unidentified students for damaging the property.”
