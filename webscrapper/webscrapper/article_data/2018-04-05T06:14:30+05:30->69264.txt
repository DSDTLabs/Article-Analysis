KOLKATA: The   (DRI) on Wednesday evening halted a Hyderabad-bound aircraft that was taxiing for takeoff to get hold of a passenger and his luggage. The passenger was carrying a bag that had allegedly been passed to him earlier that day by another flyer who had flown in from Dubai.

 According to airport sources, DRI officers came running to the departure gate of the   flight after its door had been closed and the   had officially departed. The plane had been pushed back at 7.11pm and was rolling towards the runway when the sleuths ordered the airline ground staff to make arrangements for the flight’s return to the parking bay.
 
 At the  , controllers had moments earlier received a call from a security officer, instructing the recall of the flight. The controller, though surprised, complied. He radioed the pilot to return to the parking bay.
 
 Once the plane returned, DRI officers boarded it and strode straight to the seat of passenger   and escorted him out of the flight. Airline staff, meanwhile, reopened the luggage hold in the aircraft belly to fish out the two registered bags that were booked in the passenger's name.
 
 Once DRI had accomplished its task, the airline removed Agarwal’s name from the passenger list and his luggage were also recorded to have been taken off the aircraft. At 8.06pm, the flight was again cleared for departure. It took of with the remaining 156 passengers.
 
 A security expert said the only reason behind such urgency could be specific intelligence inputs about the possibility of the consignment changing hands on the flight or immediately on landing. “DRI officers probably suspected involvement of another passenger or an airline staff and did not want to take any chance,” he said.
