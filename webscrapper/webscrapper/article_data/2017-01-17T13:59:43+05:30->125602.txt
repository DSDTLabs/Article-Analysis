NEW DELHI: Former   chief minister   on Tuesday alleged the   government has engaged a company in important activities though it was earlier blacklisted for printing currency notes.

 He said he had written to Prime Minister for clarification, but has received no reply.
 
 Chandy told a press conference that a parliamentary committee had submitted a report stating that government should not print notes abroad.
 
 He said the company   was denied security clearance and the home ministry had blacklisted it in 2012 after currency printing papers were found lying unused in its printing presses and godowns.
 
 Chandy alleged that after he raised the issue, the name of the company was removed from the website of India-Uk Tech Summit, which had earlier announced it as a 'platinum partner'.
 
 Chandy said the government should answer if De La Rue has been shortlisted for printing plastic notes.
 
 He said the company is associated with Centre's important activities and its CEO has said that it has opened offices in Delhi.
 
 'Its share value has shot up by 33% in 2016,'   said.
