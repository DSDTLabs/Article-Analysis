MUMBAI: Following a request from the state’s tourism department, the state has asked schools to take their students for an educational or rural   once every year.

 According to a government resolution issued by the school education department, in order to give the state’s tourism policy a boost, schools can undertake a trip once every year. “Schools of all mediums and affiliated to all boards are being permitted to take students of class V to X on one educational or   tour every year to help students learn about the history, geography, culture and other educational things by witnessing them first hand,” said Suvarna Kharat, deputy secretary, school education department in the  .
 
 However, the education department has stated that the trips will not be binding on any students. “These trips must not be forced on the students. The school must take the consent of parents and students for any such trips organised,” said the GR.
 
 Principals have welcomed the instructions. “Currently, there are no set rules on where schools must go on educational trips. Most schools in the urban parts of the state take their students to amusement or water parks. There is nothing educational about it. A rural trip will definitely add value to a child’s learning,” said Prashant Redij, Mumbai principals association.
 
 However, parents are not happy with the order. “The state should have gone beyond the request of the tourism department and framed rules relating to safety of the students on such trips. Parents are being forced to pay high charges and also sign undertakings which state that they will not be responsible in case of a mishap. These are things that requires the state’s attention,” said Jayant Jain, president, Forum for Fairness in Education, a parents group.
