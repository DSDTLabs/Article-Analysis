NEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Friday started testing ‘anti-pollution’ towers on a trial basis at the   flyover in   to evaluate the technology, which can reduce levels of particulate matter in the air, the government said.

 “The towers absorb particulate matter from surroundings and release fresh air back into the atmosphere. They have been installed on an experimental basis for demonstrating its effectiveness in the reduction of particulate matter,” said the government in a statement.
 
 Officials that ITO is a convenient location as it already has an air quality monitoring station. However, results will need to be analysed over a short period of time to find any difference. Delhi environment minister Imran Hussain said that the performance of these towers will be monitored and the results obtained will be evaluated for checking their efficacy and utility.
 
 Hussain said based on the results, the government may install these towers at prominent locations, especially at busy traffic intersections if found to be effective.
 
 The Delhi government in December had tested another new technology called the ‘smog gun’ — an experiment which turned out to be unsuccessful. The machine was tested at the busy Anand Vihar ISBT — a location which is known to be severely polluted. The machine was capable of spraying atomised water up to a height of 100 metres in fine particles to settle particulate matter in the surrounding area.
 
 The   later however had called it ineffective, saying the machine was increasing the moisture content in the surroundings and was not able to cover enough area.
