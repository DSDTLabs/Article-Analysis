MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena has put its ally, the BJP, in a spot by suggesting that RSS chief   should be the BJP-led NDA's candidate for the presidential election.

 Matoshree is throwing its weight around as it knows that BJP, notwithstanding its win in the UP assembly elections, needs its support in the crucial election scheduled for July .
 
 Sanjay Raut, Sena MP, told mediapersons on Monday that BJP bosses will have to visit Matoshree for talks with Uddhav Thackeray on the issue. “Matoshree offers delicious food,“ Raut quipped.
 
 This is an indication that Thackeray will keep away from the NDA dinner conclave to be shortly hosted in Delhi by PM Narendra Modi. The PM had, in a telephonic conversation recently, invited Thackeray for the NDA meet to informally discuss the presidential nominee.
 
 “Bhagwat's name is being discussed (for the presidential election). This will surely be a good choice for Hindu rashtra (nation),“ Raut said. The NDA's presidential candidate should be “competent, have good knowledge of the Constitution and should be a strong nationalist,“ he added.
 
 “Uddhavji will take the final decision on the issue,“ Raut said.
