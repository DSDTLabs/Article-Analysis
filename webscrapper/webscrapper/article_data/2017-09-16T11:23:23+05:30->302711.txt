CHANDIGARH: The National Commission for   ( ) on Friday has sought a reply from the   government on a petition filed by a Delhi municipal councellor to reopen the   of a French national Katia Darnand in Chandigarh. 

 Gurkirat Singh Kotli, a grandson of the slain  , his friends Manjinder Singh, alias Teja, Kuldip Singh, Inderjit Singh, Ashwani, and two cops of the Punjab Police, Sukhvinder Singh and Jasbir Singh were accused in the case, but were let off in April 1999 due to lack of any “cogent and reliable evidence“.
 
 Kotli is now the sitting MLA from Payal in Ludhiana.
 
 The councillor, Gurjeet Kaur, was accompanied by SAD leaders Maheshinder Singh Grewal, Manjinder Singh Sirsa and Parminder Singh Brar when she met the NCW chairperson Lalita Kumar Mangalam. In her plea, Gurmeet sub mitted that the case should be re-investigated since appropriate sections of the Indian Penal Code were not included in the case against Gurkirat, who allegedly attacked, kidnapped, molested and “probably raped Katia on August 31, 1994.“
 
 On the day of the incident, French tourist Katia accompanied by her two Kenyan friends James and Philip were in a Sector 22 hotel in Chandigarh, when Kotli allegedly invited them for drinks, but they refused.
 
 Thereafter, the trio left the hotel for James's rented house in Mohali. But later some armed men reached their house, attacked Kenyan nationals and abducted Katia.Gurmeet Kaur contended before the NCW that it Katia's open letter published in an English daily had mentioned that she did not get justice and was forced to give up the case fearing her life.
 
 The NCW was told that Darnand had mentioned in her letter that she had complained against Kotli and also identified him in a test parade and recorded her statement before a magistrate under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
 
 The complainant alleged that the case was not pursued effectively by the prosecution due to pressure from the then Punjab CM.
