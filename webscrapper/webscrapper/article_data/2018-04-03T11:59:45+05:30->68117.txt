Bhubaneswar: After   was celebrated with much fanfare across the state, the state capital has geared up to mark its own foundation day on April 13. Bhubaneswar will turn 70 this year. 

 The celebrations will be spearheaded by the   and will be centred around the city's   laurels. "The celebrations will be bigger and better than anything seen previously. This year marks a milestone for the city as it got global recognition as a Smart City," said president of the committee, Pradosh  .
 
 The committee has been celebrating the day for the last 30 years. "What began as a small function in 1988 has graduated to becoming a three-day programme comprising cultural programmes and felicitations. We have been asking the government to take it up as a state function instead of hosting it in collaboration with us. Despite a written order from the chief minister, the information and public relations department has not honoured our request," said Patnaik.
 
 On the occasion, all important buildings of the city will be illuminated, and a series of events - starting from a civilian parade to a photo exhibition, cultural programmes, and various competitions - will be held. As many as 25 people from different sections of the society will be felicitated for their contribution to the city's growth.
 
 The committee also urged the state government to build a memoir at the spot where the foundation plaque of the capital city lies. "At present, the plaque is affixed to the boundary wall of the assembly and not visible properly," he added.
 
 The foundation plaque was laid by   in 1948. Over the years, not much attention has been paid to it, despite the city having grown in leaps and bounds. "We request the state government to beautify the area," said Patnaik.
