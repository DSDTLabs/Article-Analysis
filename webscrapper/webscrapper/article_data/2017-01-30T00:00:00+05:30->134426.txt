Since last October, Bengalureans are fighting against the proposed   project. While a lot has been spoken about the 800-odd trees that are at risk if the project takes off, little has been spoken about the animal and bird population at risk. Given Bengaluru's biodiversity, it is home to many interesting species, including the endangered  , known as kadupapa in Kannada. 
There are said to be just around 2,000 of these timid looking nocturnal animals left in the country. There have been sightings of the animal around Palace Grounds, Sadashivnagar and surroundings, all of which come in the route for the proposed steel flyover.  , one of the main voices against the steel flyover, says, “There are many reasons for us protesting against the steel flyover project, but this is one of the biggest. Not many are looking at the biodiversity aspect. This makes for a strong case to oppose the project.”
 
 
 A previous case has shown that there was a   project that was nixed by the   in favour of protecting the slender loris. Experts tell us that legally wildlife protection makes for a strong case in the courts to oppose big projects, especially if the animals fall under the highly endangered category.
 Slender loris is listed under the Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of India, 1972, which means the animals need the highest level of legal protection. Found mainly in India and  , the slender loris has been in threat because smugglers sell them for their exotic value. Apart from that, folklore has people believing that the animals have medicinal/magical powers, which was another reason for the diminishing population.
