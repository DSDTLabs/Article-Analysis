Our next stop for the OPPO Delhi   2017 was  . The girls of the college managed to impress the judges with their talent. Members of The Doorbeen band were the celebrity judges at the college.

 
  
  WINNER: Alankriti Singh
 
 
 As we began, more than 50 girls had registered to participate in the introduction round. Emcee Gitesh Singh amused the audience with his mimicry and witty remarks, while DJ Sumit Sethi played some groovy numbers to keep the participants entertained. 
 
  In the talent round, most of the girls chose to sing and there were only a few who chose to dance or walk the ramp. Members of The Doorbeen, who also performed at the event, told us, "It was fun to be here. It doesnâ€™t matter who wins, for us, all the contestants were equally good. It is always a pleasure to perform in a college."
