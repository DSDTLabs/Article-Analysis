Patna: Former JD(U) Uttar Pradesh unit’s president   has been expelled from the party for his statement that the party supported SP-Congress alliance candidates in assembly election in the state. 

 “Bhaiyya has been found involved in anti-party activities. He has continuously been challenging the top leadership of the party. JD(U) national president  , while exercising his powers under sections 3A and 4A of Article 21 of the party’s constitution, has expelled him (Bhaiyya) from the party with immediate effect,” JD(U) secretary general and national spokesperson K C Tyagi said on Sunday.

 Bhaiyya, who was then UP JD(U) state president, had announced his party’s support to the SP-Congress candidates at a joint press conference held at Samajwadi Party office in Lucknow on February 12. The JD(U) central committee, on February 13, clarified that the party was not supporting any party or alliance in UP polls.
 
 Tyagi also said JD(U) has no ‘working unit’ in UP. All the party units in UP were dissolved at the JD(U) core committee meeting in Patna on January 23 this year.
