HYDERABAD: In yet another case of mob violence fuelled by rumour-mongering, a   was roughed up by a group of locals in the Afzal Sagar area of   on Monday.

 
 
  
 Suspecting her to be a child-lifter, residents of the nearby Mangar Basti, first interrogated 19-year-old Nagamani, and later thrashed her for failing to give satisfactory replies. The woman was subsequently rescued by the Habeeb Nagar police who reached the spot on being alerted about the incident.
 
 The incident, police said, occurred in the afternoon when the woman from Ziaguda went to Balram Hotel in Mallepally to buy chips. Prior to that, she along with another ragpicker Nagraju, had consumed toddy at a toddy compound near Bhoiguda Kaman.
 
 On spotting the ragpicker eat chips by herself, the suspicious locals, provoked by social media rumours about child lifters making the rounds of city roads, cornered the teenager and demanded to know her whereabouts. When she could not give them a satisfactory response, perhaps for being in a drunken condition, the locals beat her up, the police said.
 
 The cops were alerted when the mob started to grow, thus putting the life of the rag-picker in danger. “We reached the spot soon after and freed her from the crowd. She was later shifted to the Habeeb Nagar police station,” said K Ashok Chakravarthy, assistant commissioner of police, Asifnagar (who is currently in-charge of the Goshamahal division). He added: “We have conducted independent inquiries about the background of the rag- picker and found that she does not belong to any child-lifting gang.”
 
 Meanwhile, following instructions from the commissioner of police (Hyderabad) the Rein Bazaar police conducted an awareness programme, to caution people against social media rumours, at the Murtuza Chaman and all other mosques within in limits.
