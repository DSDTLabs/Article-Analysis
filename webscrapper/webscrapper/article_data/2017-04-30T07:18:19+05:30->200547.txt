NEW DELHI: Congress on Saturday whittled down the organisational responsibility of veteran  , in what was seen as a setback for the leader who has been at the centrestage of party affairs for over a decade.

 AICC appointed deputy whip in Lok Sabha K C Venugopal as general secretary incharge of Karnataka and V Chella Kumar as party incharge of Goa. Karnataka is due for polls next year and, apart from Punjab, is the only major state where Congress is in office. Singh was looking after the affairs of the two states. While Singh still retains the responsibility of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the shedding of his mandate marks a break from the past when his duties only got bigger with every organisational rejig. That he has been replaced by younger leaders could be an indication of things to come.
 
 However, Singh welcomed the change by saying, “I am happy finally new team is being picked up by Rahul Gandhi. I am loyal to the party and Nehru-Gandhi family and owe my position to the party and to them.“
 
 Though part of a long pending party reshuffle, Singh's divestment comes in the wake of strong criticism within the party of his handling of Goa affairs where the party failed to form a government despite finishing ahead of BJP in the recent assembly polls. BJP had rubbed it in when Singh tried to raise the matter of the governors' decisions in Goa and Manipur, saying that the Congress had even failed to elect its leader while an alternate alliance staked its claim to government formation.
 
 Congress named Manickam Tagore, Madhu Yaskhi Goud, P C Vishnunadh and Sake Sailjanath as secretaries to assist Venugopal in Karnataka and also appointed Amit Deshmukh as secretary for Goa affairs.
 
 This is the second big change in AICC responsibilities after former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot last week replaced Gurudas Kamath to oversee poll-bound Gujarat indicating the organisational reshuffle was being done in bits and pieces.
