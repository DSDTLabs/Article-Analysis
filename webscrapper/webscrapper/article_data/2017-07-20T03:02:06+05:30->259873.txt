GREATER NOIDA:   buffs in the city are in for a treat. The number of movie screens in the twin cities shot up by five as   ushered in its luxury movie watching experience, Insignia, in   on Wednesday.

 With the launch, Greater Noida has a total of 10 screens now, and the twin cities together have 52.
 
 “We chose to bring Insignia to Greater Noida as we expect future consumers to spend more time in this region. While we already have one in Delhi, this is the first time the Noida region will get a designer movie watching experience,”Alok Tandon, CEO of Inox Leisure Ltd, told TOI at the formal launch of Insignia on Wednesday.
 
 Located at Omaxe Mall, movie goers can watch movies in style while reclining on comfortable chairs and enjoying meals curated by chef  , which will be served by butlers on call. With five screens, five films will be showing at the same time. The entry ticket range is Rs 300, and goes up to Rs 500.
 
 “Movie goers now prefer to go to new locations for a good entertainment experience. We have opened this centre by keeping that in mind,” Tandon said. 
 
 From only two screens in the early 2000s to 52 now, the twin cities have seen an exponential growth in multiplexes over the last decade.
