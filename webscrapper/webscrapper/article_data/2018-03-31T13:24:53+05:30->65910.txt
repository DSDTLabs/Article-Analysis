Day 1 of the second edition of   2018 was marked by some bold and out of the box collections by young designers like Tisharth by Shivani. The collection, which was majorly focused on the night sky and its various hues, was all about layered dresses and gowns in royal blues, whites and blacks. Plunging necklines, frilly high-low skirts, long and flowy gowns dominated this collection by designer Shivani Jain.
 
  
 To add charm to the already mesmerising show, Bollywood actress   walked the ramp with aplomb in her all-white, mildly sequinned and heavily ruffled gown. In her side-swept hair and minimal make-up, Nushrat looked every bit a moonlight princess and let her gown do all the talking.
  
  
 When asked to describe designer Shivani Jain’s costume that she was walking in as the showstopper, Nushrat coyly said, “Pristine! White is my colour because you get what you see; I like things simple.”
