Trichy: Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan on Monday laid the foundation stone for a road-over-bridge across the Trichy-Chennai national highway near Siruvachur in Perambalur. The place where the RoB is planned at a cost of Rs 13.3 crore is among the 78 accident-prone zones identified by the national highway authority of India (NHAI) in Tamil Nadu. While speaking to reporters after the event, the Union minister said that out of the 78 accident-prone zones, 11 are from Trichy region. He assured that necessary steps would be taken to prevent accidents at these places. Tamil Nadu is one among the states which leads in terms of fatal accidents every year.  “The RoB’s position in Siruvachur becomes pivotal as the stretch has recorded over 10 deaths in the past three years due to accidents, said Pon Radhakrishnan.  “Madurakaliamman temple in Sirvachur attracts pilgrims from across several states. While the national highway has to be crossed in order to reach the temple, absence of an RoB across the highway has been making them vulnerable to accidents, said Perambalur collector V Santha.
