PALAKKAD: Even as Agali police on Saturday arrested all 16 accused in the murder of tribal youth Madhu, fresh evidence corroborates that his lynching was premeditated. Madhu's mother Malli and his sister   pointed out that more than two dozen people couldn't have trekked four kms into the forest to drag   out of a cave where he normally stayed, and beat him up brutally, without the active connivance of forest officials. Forest minister K Raju has promised action against the forest officials. 

 The postmortem report revealed that Madhu died due to internal and head injuries. Initially, the action council of tribal organizations blocked the ambulance carrying the body of Madhu demanding the arrest of all accused, some of whom are allegedly   activists, under provisions of the   Atrocities Act.
 
 District superintendent of police Prateesh Kumar later confirmed the arrests. "All 16 accused in the case were arrested and have been slapped with murder charges. Cases were also registered against them under the SC / ST Atrocities Act," he said.
