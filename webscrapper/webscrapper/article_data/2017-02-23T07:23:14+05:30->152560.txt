PUNE: The Khadki police on Wednesday booked 40   activists for rioting after they allegedly attacked seven policemen, including three officers at a polling booth in  , in Bopodi on Tuesday.

 Police said the dispute broke out after the cops refused to let them in to cast their votes after 5.30 pm, the closing time. The state reserve police force used lathi-charge to disperse the mob, officials added.
 
 Joint commissioner of police   told TOI, “We are invoking stringent provisions of the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) against people involved in attacking policemen. We will intensify the action so that nobody thinks of getting away with it.“
 
 According to senior inspector   of Khadki police station, “Post-deadline, the gate was closed as per the returning officer's directions. Ten minutes later, an NCP leader and his supporters, including women, reached the polling centre claiming they wanted to cast their votes, but they were not allowed to enter. However, they didn't follow orders and insisted on talking to the returning officer.“
 
 “When the returning officer refused, they picked up an argument and refused to go back. The situation went of control when the party workers tried to break into the premises and misbehaved with policemen. They then abused and attacked the men on duty . The state reserve police force resorted to mild lathi-charge and dispersed the mob,“ Bhosale said, adding that a complaint was registered against the attackers.
 
 The incident has been caught on a camera and a call to arrest them would be taken after the poll results are out on Thursday.
