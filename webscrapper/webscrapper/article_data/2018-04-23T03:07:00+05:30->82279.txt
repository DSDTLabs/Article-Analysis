 This tiny tot currently has a total of nine national level records in his name. Sunita Dhote, an adjudicator from India Book of Records, monitored the proceedings and awarded citations to the young wonder kid. Dhote termed Varad as a “golden wonder boy with all the gold medals”.
 
 Talking to TOI, Ujwala Malkhandale, a proud mother of Varad, was euphoric as she said, “Since his early childhood, he has been an extremely curious child, seeking details of everything. He does not settle for an average answer and needs everything to be accurate. He loves travelling and wherever we go, he has the habit of noticing small details about different car models, them being differently numbered and the states having different RTO series. That’s when we noticed that he has a sharp mind and decided to give it a shot”. 
 
 Ujwala is head of the electrical engineering department of Priyadarshini College and Bhushan, his father, is an engineer with MSRDC.
 
 Caretaker of his crèche said, “He is a genius and a loving child full of life. At an age when most children run away from studies, he is very particular with his homework and determined to become a doctor in future.”
