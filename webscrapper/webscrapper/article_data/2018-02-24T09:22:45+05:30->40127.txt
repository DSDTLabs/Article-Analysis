RANCHI:   chief minister   will address   (United) here on Sunday,   

 "The party president and chief minister of Bihar will arrive in Ranchi from Patna on Sunday morning. He will take part in a meeting of JDU workers of Jharkhand at a ground near the   in Dhurwa and address the gathering at noon," JDU Jharkhand president Jaleshwar Mahto told TOI on Friday. 
 
 This will be Kumar's first visit to Ranchi in nine years to address a JDU meeting. "He addressed a rally under the JDU banner last in 2009 during the parliamentary poll campaign," the party's state-unit general secretary-cum-spokesperson Shravan Kumar, said. Nitish had made a public appearance in Ranchi's Morhabadi Ground on May 17 last year at a tribal rally spear-headed by Salkhan Murmu. 
 
 Stating that preparations for Nitish's visit were on in full swing, Mahto claimed that more than 4,000 JDU workers will attend the meeting. 
 
 Nitish's visit comes at a time when political parties in the state are involved in preparations for the urban local body (ULB) elections, scheduled tentatively in April. This will be the first civic body elections in Jharkhand where candidates can contest under the banner of political parties.
 
 JDU sources said it wants to contest the state's civic body polls in all 24 districts and Kumar is expected to give his approval for the same during Sunday's meeting. 
 
 "The party workers want to contest the civic polls and our district level organisational framework has been strengthened in the past seven months," Mahto said. 
 
 During his previous visits, Nitish had unleashed a series of verbal volleys at the ruling NDA alliance of Jharkhand for its anti-tribal policies. 
 
 This time, political observers will be keen to hear how Nitish addresses his workers for the first time in Ranchi since he broke up with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) to form an alliance with BJP in Bihar in July last year.
