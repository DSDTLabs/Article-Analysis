HYDERABAD: After humans and animals, it's now infertility in trees. Chemical, automobile and   is so high in the city that many plant species are turning infertile.

 City researchers have found that stamens, male-fertilizing organs of flowers, are malformed with damage to pollen contained in them. Like in humans, male sterility is more pronounced in trees, particularly those growing in industrial areas of Hyderabad.
 
 Researchers from Palaeobotany and   and the department of environmental sciences,  , collected flower samples of about two dozen trees from Jeedimetla and Uppal where a large number of industries are concentrated. The samples included neem, coconut, Gulmohar, castor, eucalyptus, toddy palm, grass, maize.
 
 The OU team noticed physical changes in structure of pollen grain, which has either changed colour, shrunk or both. Thus far, researchers from different parts of the world concentrated on damage caused by air and dust pollution to leaves. Not many have studied the damage to fertility levels in trees due to pollution. Chemical pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide in automobile and industrial exhaust are responsible for damage to anthers or stamens. The team found pollutants attached to pollen grains.
 
 “In several parts of the city, road dust has taken a big toll on tree growth. Only trees with high pollution tolerance index could withstand ever-growing chemical, automobile and industrial pollution in the city. The civic body should identify areas based on pollution level and plant trees with different levels of pollution tolerance to sustain green cover,“ said green activist  , who has been popularizing bicycleriding in Telugu states.
 
 Earlier studies revealed a high-level of infertility in traffic police personnel and city bus drivers. Uncontrolled use of plastic has also affected fertility levels in women. City gynaecologists attribute increased   to chemicals present in plastic.
