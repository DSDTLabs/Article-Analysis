GAYA: Nearly four years after advertisement of vacancies of teachers for different subjects in the colleges and PG departments of   (MU), no appointment has been made for subjects like Botany, Zoology, Political Science and History, among others.

 As per records, the BPSC advertised 47 post of assistant professors in Political Science in 2014. The number of vacancies advertised in Botany, Zoology and History was 37, 46 and 33 respectively. Posts were also advertised for Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, English, Philosophy and Economics, among others.
 
 While appointments have been made on the BPSCâ€™s recommendations in subjects like Physics, Chemistry and English, no appointment has so far been made in Botany, Zoology, Political Science and History.
 
 BPSC sources say that appointments in these subjects are held up on account of disputes on the point of eligibility.
 
 Even though the BPSC advertised the post of assistant professors separately in Botany and Zoology, the two subjects apparently do not figure in the list of NET subjects. Botany and Zoology, as per UGC documents, are part of the larger Life Sciences category..
 
 Similarly, candidates who have cleared NET in Public Administration have staked claim over Political Science posts. History and Ancient History, though different subjects in the universities of Bihar, do not figure separately in the list of subjects for which NET is held.
 
 Asked about the delay in filling vacancies, MU VC Prof Qamar Ahsan said the university did not have a role to play in the recruitment process. Appointments will be made as and when the recommendations are received from the BPSC, said Ahsan.
