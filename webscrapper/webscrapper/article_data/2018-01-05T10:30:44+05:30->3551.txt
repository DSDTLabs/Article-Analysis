COIMBATORE: Two miscreants, claiming to be policemen, fled with nine sovereigns of   ornaments after duping a 69-year-old woman on Nanjundapuram Road in the city on Thursday morning.

 The victim, A Amsavalli, who is staying with her daughter’s family at Parson Apartment on Nanjundapuram Road, had gone for a walk around 7.45am, police sources said. 
 
 “Two men intercepted her and told her that they were policemen in plainclothes. They told her that as several chain snatching incidents were reported from the stretch, she should not wear gold ornaments. They asked her to remove the gold ornaments she was wearing and offered to wrap them in a paper for safekeeping. Trusting them, Amsavalli handed over her gold chain and bangles weighing nine sovereigns to the duo, who immediately gave her a small parcel. They asked her not to open it until she reaches home,” a police officer said.
 
 The woman, who checked the content of the parcel as soon as she entered the apartment premises, only found a small plastic piece inside. She immediately informed the private security guard of the apartment, who alerted police personnel at the Nanjundapuram checkpost.
 
 Ramanathapuram (crime) police registered a case and formed a special team to nab the culprits.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (crime) P Perumal said police have got CCTV footage of the duo. “We will nab them soon,” he said.
