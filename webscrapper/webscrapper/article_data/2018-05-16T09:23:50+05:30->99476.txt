MUMBAI: India can consider themselves lucky to get a favourable draw for January’s  , but former skipper   says that a lot of factors have to work in their favour for them to go past the group stage.

 
 
 
 India are paired with hosts UAE, Thailand and Bahrain in Group A and will be away from the superpowers of Asian football. Bhutia, who led the team the last time India qualified for the tournament in 2011, says the fitness of current skipper and talisman   is very important for the fortunes of the team.
 
 
 
 “We will have to make sure that he (Chhetri) stays away from injuries and get him in his best form during that time. We all know that he can make a big difference. The good thing with Sunil is that he has got the experience of playing in the Asia Cup (2011). That's what he will have to share with players and guide them because the Asia Cup is the biggest tournament for any player in India. It can't get bigger than that till we qualify for a FIFA World Cup,” said Bhutia on Tuesday, speaking on the sidelines of an event by Sony to signal the start of their 30-day countdown campaign for the 2018 World Cup.
 
 Bhutia further said that the upcoming 4-nations Intercontinental Cup to be held at the Mumbai Football Arena from June 1 should be ideal for coach   to finalise his core group of players.
 
 “I think he (Constantine) should start working with having the core of the team set. Obviously as a coach he will know who the important players are. You can always experiment later, but the core needs to be intact.”
 
 Constantine likes to gives youngsters a chance and has been known to hand out debut to players during his second stint as India coach.
 
 “You can’t keep changing the team. Big teams don’t change their core every now and then. So in every tournament if you keep changing teams, keep having selection trials every time you go play Asian Cup, South Asian (SAFF) Cup, it becomes challenging,” Bhutia said.
