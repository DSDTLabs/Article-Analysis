PANAJI/CANACONA: Two water bodies — a flowing stream at Devbagh and another seasonal water body near Patnem in Canacona — were cleaned up by activists and members of various bodies in a voluntary effort on Sunday.

 The cleaning drive was organized by Goenkar, a local NGO in Canacona, students of  , Canacona,   (FSI), Bangalore and others in a two day effort.
 
 The 1.5-kilometre long stream at Devbagh has been heavily polluted over the years, as locals have been dumping waste into it. The water along its route is used for irrigation, cattle and others. “There were carry bags, garlands, plastic bottles and even medical waste in the water,”  , general secretary, Goenkar said.
 
 The volunteers carried out the work manually, but were hampered by lack of machinery at their disposal. The FSL team comprising some foreigners had brought some equipment, gloves and containers, but the topography and growth of bushes posed a problem. With some local help, the team even managed to desilt a small part of the water body.
 
 Another water body opposite mamlatdar’s office at Patnem that is activated by monsoonal flow after June was also partly cleaned. “Only a 600m dried up stretch of the seasonal stream along national highway which is heavily dumped with waste was cleaned,” Bhagat said. A few stretches of this stream are overgrown with vegetation . But the worst impact of human intervention is near the highway, where passersby use it to dump their waste. “We filled a total of 40 bags of plastic and other waste,” a participant said.
