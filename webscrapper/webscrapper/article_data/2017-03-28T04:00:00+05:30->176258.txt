Vadodara: In last five years, the deficit of M S University, which is run by tax payers’ money, has increased by over four times. 

 The deficit of Rs 1.59 crore in financial year 2011-12 has increased to Rs 6.13 crore in 2015-16. This has come to light through the reply that the university itself gave to a senate member who had sought year-wise details of the deficit.
 
 Although, the deficit later came down to Rs 1 crore in financial year 2013-14, it increased further to Rs 10.56 crore in financial year 2014-15. 
 
 The university has reasoned that the shortfall was due to payment of   arrears to teaching and non-teaching staff and excess expenditure over the revised budget. Insiders, however, said that in the last five years, the university has made many haphazard expenditures forming numerous cells, new institutes and organizing programmes whose expenses were incurred without any provision and allocation of budget. Questions have been also raised in the past on expenditures being incurred based on reports of some so-called “high powered committees”. MSU’s officer on special duty (registrar) Dr Neerja Jaiswal, said, “We have already conveyed to the state government to reimburse the arrears given to the teaching and non-teaching staff. The vice-chancellor has personally pursued the matter with the state government.” “If you compare the deficits of 2014-15 and 2015-16, it has drastically come down,” she said. 
 
 She added that inflationary trends also play a role as university has to pay prevailing market rates instead of the allocated budget for purchase of items.
