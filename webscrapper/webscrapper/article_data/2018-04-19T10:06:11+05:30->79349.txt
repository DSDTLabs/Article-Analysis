AJMER: Priests and local people of Pushkar have asked Prime Minister   to intervene in the matter of the drying Pushkar Sarovar, as it is hampering feelings of devotees who come to Pushkar. The pond is gradually drying and there is no alternative for filling the 19 tanks constructed on the ghats for devotees.

 Crores of rupees were spent in 2010 for deepening the Pushkar pond to construct canals for bringing rain water to the pond. But when the silt was removed from the pond the pores opened and all the water which collected in the pond during monsoon went away.
 
 Last monsoon, the water level of the pond went up to 15 feet which gradually decreased and came back to 5 feet. “Another reason for the drying up of this pond is that there is no check on underground water pumping in the region as hotels require water for their guests,” said a source. 
 
 There were protests by some priests recently when fish started dying in the pond and water level went low, “Administration constructed tanks on ghats and last year they were filled with Bisalpur water but now no alternative has been adopted,” said a local.
 
 The pond is the main source of income for hundreds of priests in Pushkar as it is important for performing puja in the only   of the region, “We perform rituals mostly for the ancestors and therefore Pushkar is an important abode,” said  .
 
 Looking at the condition, activist   wrote to the PM to intervene in developing the pond which is a place of faith for thousands of people. “They constructed canals wasting crores of rupees to bring water to the pond but those are not useful for the town,” said Arun Parashar.
 
 Parashar had asked Modi to make such a plan that water in the pond remains all through the year to maintain purity of the place.
