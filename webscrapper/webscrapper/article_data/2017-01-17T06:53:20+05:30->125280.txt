MUMBAI: Just before the release of the popular   (ASER), a government teacher in the state has raised concerns over the methodology employed in its preparation. ASER is a popular report on the learning levels of children across states. The report is to be revealed in New Delhi on Wednesday. 

 Ranjitsinh Disale, a   from Solapur, wrote to  , the NGO which does the survey, and pointed out various concerns. Disale said ASER uses a sample size of 0.12% of the students in the country. "Just 0.12% does not give the right picture of the ground reality across the country. The reliability coefficient of ASER is only about 16% which is very low as per international standards," said Disale.
 
 He said the content used to evaluate learning was not relevant to the syllabus. "In addition to this, the surveyors are women from self-help groups or private tuition teachers. It is possible that the children do not respond properly to such people as they are not known to them and this affects the final result," he said.
 
 Pratham said it would go into the matter. "He had sent us these complaints last year too. We will consider the concerns after the release of this year's report," Pratham co-founder   said.
