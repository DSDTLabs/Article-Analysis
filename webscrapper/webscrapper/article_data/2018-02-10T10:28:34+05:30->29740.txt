PUNE: A study of the annual pollution data for the city shows an alarming 70% rise in the concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers) in 2017 from the level five years ago.

 The level was 29.01µg/m3 in 2013 but went up to 49.2 µg/m3 in 2017. The annual standard for PM2.5 is 40 µg/m3, beyond which it is considered dangerous. PM2.5 is a serious health concern since smaller particles of pollutants travel deeper into the lungs and clog breathing.
 
 The data was collated by city-based System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR),   ( ).
 
 Gufran Beig, project director of SAFAR, told TOI that 2016 and 2017 witnessed the highest annual concentrations of PM2.5 in Pune. The data under study spanned five years since 2013.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 SAFAR project director   said, “PM includes both solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Many manmade and natural sources emit PM directly or emit other pollutants that react in the atmosphere to form PM. These solid and liquid particles come in a wide range of sizes.”
 
 He said deficient rainfall years are accompanied by an increase in the concentration of pollutants in the air, while wet years tend to see a decrease. A good monsoon not only means good rain, but also better air quality, he pointed out.
 
 While 2014 and 2015 were deficient monsoon years, 2016 and 2017 saw an almost normal monsoon. Even so, PM 2.5 has been consistently rising in Pune. Experts and the civic body attribute the rising pollution to vehicle emissions.
 
 The transport sector contributed close to 42% of PM2.5 emissions in 2015 in the Pune metropolitan region while other sources like suspended dust contributed 33%. Both sectors’ contribution to the pollutant was the highest in comparison with other sectors such as industry and biofuel, Beig said.
 
 “The trend since 2015, in terms of contributors, is likely to be the same even in 2017. A major contributor of PM10 (which is less harmful than PM2.5) is suspended dust, which contributes around 50% of the pollutant,” Beig said.
 
 Doctors said they have seen a simultaneous rise in respiratory tract infections over the years, especially in 2017-18.
 
 Vivek  , senior consultant physician at  , said he has seen a noticeable rise in respiratory illnesses in 2017-18. “The city’s air is loaded with pollutants. These pollutants, especially particulate matter (aerosols), choke the respiratory pathway, which then gets inflamed and causes conditions like nasal allergies (allergic rhinitis), intractable cough, sinusitis, allergic bronchitis and lower respiratory tract infections. If the pollution load is very high, it can manifest as a severe infection,” he said.
