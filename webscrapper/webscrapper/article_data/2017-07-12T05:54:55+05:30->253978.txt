CHENNAI: Residents of   employees of the  , a de-addiction centre in Retteri, on Monday night after they heard inmates pleading for help to save them from being beaten up. Police rushed to the spot and held talks with the protesters before calling up the families of the inmates and asking them to take the patients back home till the matter was solved. Two women inmates including a juvenile who managed to escape during the melee were traced by the Puzhal police on Tuesday. They were produced before the Thiruvotiyur court and handed over to their parents.

 S Prakash, a resident of the locality, said, “There would be constant shouting and we would hear cries for help from the inmates who were admitted there. There have been earlier incidents where inmates have been beaten up and police used to visit the centre regularly. We had complained to the police on many occasions but no action was taken.”

In February this year, Sunil Kumar, 44, who was receiving treatment at the same centre fell to his death from the second floor of the facility. Police had then arrested Bose, 39, and Devaraj, 31, who operated the centre.

The centres also do not have permits to operate and are not monitored by authorities,” said  , who is familiar with the running of these centres.
