CHENNAI: Maintaining that its copper smelter unit in Tuticorin was not a polluter, Sterlite Copper, part of Vedanta Resources, on Wednesday offered to open its gates "for people to see for themselves than believe rumours and half-truths." The activists, however, have turned down the offer. 

  "Over the past two months there has been a social media explosion against us. We recognise that most people who have joined the protests because they want the right action to be taken. Seeing is believing ... they can visit the plant, speak to our employees and ascertain the truth," said P Ramnath, CEO of Sterlite Copper. 
 
  Reaching out to neighbourhood communities for a dialogue, he said the Tuticorin resident's voice is lost in the din of protests. "All should join hands in deescalating the deadlock and give way to a dialogue," said the CEO. 
 
 
 
 Environmental activist Nithyanand Jayaram said the problem is not what happens inside the factory, but the pollution it causes outside. “A factory visit is not what people want. They want it shut,” he said.
 
 On April 10, the state government’s pollution control board revoked the approvals given to Sterlite to operate the smelter. It withdrew the ‘consent to operate’ the smelter which was doubling its capacity from four lakh tonnes. Sterlite has moved the appellate authority in TNPCB and the case is scheduled for hearing on May 4.
 
 Ramnath reiterated that Sterlite had adhered to all conditions imposed by NEERI and the Supreme Court and its facilities will now conform to the benchmarks set by International Finance Corporation (IFC). The company has invested more than ?485 crore on environment and social measures, he said.
