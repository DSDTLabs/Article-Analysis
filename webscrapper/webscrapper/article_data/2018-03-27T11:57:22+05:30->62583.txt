NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) town planning department and Dhantoli zone have raised objection to railway constructing a toilet for its community hall in Ajni area. The construction has come up in NMC’s proposed development plan (DP) road, confirmed assistant municipal commissioner  .

 “Now, the town planning department will serve a notice to the railways to demolish the toilet construction,” she said. 
 
 The NMC intends to construct a 24-metre-wide DP road from   water tank through Ajni railway station area to   and connect reservation counter situated on Cement Road. As the land is owned by railways, the NMC had approached for procurement of 300m land for the purpose. 
 
 If constructed, the road will solve various problems being faced by the citizens of south Nagpur. Presently, citizens have to take a long route of at least 4-5km to reach Narendra Nagar from Wanjari Nagar or Kaushalya Nagar. Now Narendra Nagar will be at 2km distance from these locations. 
 
 Railways spokesperson confirmed receiving a proposal from the NMC and that it was under consideration.
