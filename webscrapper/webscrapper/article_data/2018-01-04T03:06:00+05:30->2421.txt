Porvorim: The cabinet has extended the debt relief scheme till March 31 this year for borrowers affected by the ban on  . The proposed extension, however, will be limited to only those proposals that are pending with the banks or those which were rejected earlier.

 The stateâ€™s decision was announced by CM Manohar Parrikar during a post-cabinet briefing on Wednesday.
 
 The decision to extend the debt relief scheme was taken following a representation from barge owners and the Goa Barge Owners Association to extend it for a further period as they faced technical difficulties in availing benefits under the scheme. The banks were not willing to forward the proposals pending with them beyond the earlier cut-off date of March 31, 2017. 
 
 The cabinet note stated that this being the last revision of the scheme, the final authority to grant benefits, either fully or in exceptional cases as an ex-gratia benefit in a single case or group of cases, shall lie with the CM.
 
 The debt relief scheme was framed taking into consideration the loan liabilities of the borrowers after mining in Goa came to a standstill in 2012, following a ban.
