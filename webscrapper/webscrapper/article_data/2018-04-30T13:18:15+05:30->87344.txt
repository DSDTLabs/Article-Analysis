COIMBATORE:   syndicate meeting will be held on the second week of May. The date was fixed at the vice-chancellor’s meet held in Chennai on Friday, a source told TOI.

 “It will not be a special meeting, but a regular meet held every two weeks,” the source said. However, the meet comes amid the new controversy surrounding the university, making it significant.
 
 A video showing professor and head of the Tamil department D Gnanasekaran receiving money allegedly from an assistant professor aspirant had gone viral on social media on April 23. 
 
 Gnanasekaran maintained that the video was shot five years ago and showed a friend returning money he had borrowed.
