MUMBAI: The well-known   annually held at IC Colony in  , which was scheduled for Sunday, was cancelled by the organizers because local police delayed permission till Saturday evening. This is the first time the one-day carnival, launched in 1982, will missed its scheduled date. 

 Though the local police finally gave their approval on the eve of the event, the organisers said that it had come in too late for them to make all the arrangements. The organisers, the IC Colony Forum, and local corporator Abhishek Ghosalkar of the   said they had made several visits to the   police station for the past 15 days, only to be told by the cops to change first the name and then the venue, and finally to alter the date of the carnival. They said the police also told them that they could not have a DJ and not more than 500 people could attend. 
 
 However, deputy commissioner of police for the region Vikram Deshmane dismissed all the allegations about changes demanded to the name, venue and date of the festival and also the total number of visitors. Deshmane told TOI, "See our letter. We have only objected to DJ music owing to the Bombay high court's order on noise pollution."
 
 Asked whether the organisers could go ahead without DJs, as they had agreed to do, the DCP said, "How can I comment on that? That is for them to decide." Senior inspector of MHB police station Ashok Jadhav confirmed that permission had been earlier denied for the carnival, though he declined to give reasons.
