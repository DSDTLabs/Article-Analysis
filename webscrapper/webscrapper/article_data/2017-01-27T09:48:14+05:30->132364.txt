ISLAMABAD: The latest documents made public by CIA include a letter to former US President   from the then Pakistan President, General  , assuring him Pakistan would not build  .

 The July 5, 1982 letter was in reply to a communication from Reagan, sent through US envoy Vernon Walters, in which he expressed concern about  . “It’s saddening that Vernon Walters told me that the US had certified information about Pakistan’s plan to acquire nuclear weapons,” Zia replied.
 
 The letter quoted him telling Reagan that all such information was baseless and that Pakistan would never take a step in the nuclear arena that would affect American interests and bring it shame. He wrote that Pakistan’s nuclear programme was designed for peaceful purposes. Despite all these assurances, it is commonly believed that Pakistan had built its atom bomb during Zia’s regime.
 
 Another declassified file was a CIA report examining Pakistan-US ties against the backdrop of India-USSR relations. “Pakistan is likely to continue basically pro-Western, despite annoyance at the US part in the UN handling of Kashmir and at the US position on North Africa in the UN,” the document said. According to a side note on the same document, Pakistan’s pro-Western orientation stemmed from fear of India and USSR rather than any basic sympathy with capitalism or Christian civilisation. “It is more negative than positive,” it observed.
 
 Another handwritten note on the document said, “Pakistan is not likely to align itself firmly with the West except in exchange for substantial benefits.” Other documents include: Indo-Pak friction, Pakistan’s nuclear programme development, Zia-ul-Haq’s decision on Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s execution.
