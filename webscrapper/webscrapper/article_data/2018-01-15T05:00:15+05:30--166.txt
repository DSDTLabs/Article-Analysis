THANE: A 48-year-old vegetable vendor,   was detained by the cops from   area on Saturday for allegedly threatening two people with a toy gun.

 Aher sells vegetable near Upvan and was doing his business as usual. However on Saturday a few people asked   not to set up his stall at Upvan as the area was getting crowded due to the on-going art festival. Aher got angry and flashed a lighter-cum-toy gun to threaten the people who stopped him from setting up his stall, said a police officer.
 
 “Aher got angry and flashed his toy gun to threaten the people who had come to stop him. He apparently pointed the toy gun and asked them to move away or else he would shoot,” said a police officer from   police station. Aher was taken into custody after the police was alerted. But it was found that the gun used by his was a toy which he used for lighting cigarettes, but it did look like a real gun.
 
 “An non-cognisable complaint was filed with the police and Aher has been warned not to repeat it again as it creates panic among people,” added officer.
