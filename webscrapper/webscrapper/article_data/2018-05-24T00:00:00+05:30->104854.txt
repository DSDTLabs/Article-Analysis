A strict officer otherwise, Om Prakash Singh, DGP, UP, also knows when to have fun and spread bonhomie among his men, who work hard round-the-clock. As part of his policy to connect with his men, Singh, along with his wife Neelam, spent some quality time with a few officers of the UP Police on Sunday morning. Singh invited  , ADG Law and Order, and his wife Priya and Rajeev Krishna, ADG, Lucknow, for a morning out at the   stall in Lalbagh. 
At Sharmaâ€™s, which witnesses a large crowd on Sunday, the arrival of several police personnel at first raised an alarm. The sight of the DGP also daunted a few but soon things quieted down when people saw Singh, dressed casually, enjoying chai, samosa and bun-makkhan and indulging in laughter and sharing jokes with everyone. 
 Telling us about the purpose of such outings, Singh said, "A good team is one which plays well together and works well together. We are a force to reckon with, but we also need to let our hair down once in a while. And what better way than to spend some good time with my men who work hard all the time."
