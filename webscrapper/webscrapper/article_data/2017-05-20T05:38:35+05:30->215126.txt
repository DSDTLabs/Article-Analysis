BENGALURU: The   on Friday requested   to conduct a   into the   Anurag Tewari. “We will extend full cooperation to UP government in this regard,” said Karnataka   Siddaramaiah.

 The move comes in the backdrop of the allegations made by Tewari’s family that he was subjected to harassment while serving as food and civil supplies commissioner. Tewari’s family suspected foul play in his death even though the autopsy report suggested that he could have died of asphyxia. 
 
 The issue took a political turn with UP minister Suresh Kumar Khanna stating that Tewari was on the verge of exposing a Rs 2,000 crore scam in the food and civil supplies department.
 
 However, Siddaramaiah denied the allegations. “There is no scam in the food and civil supplies department, please do not speculate. We will request the Uttar Pradesh government to inquire and we will cooperate with the authorities,” Siddaramaiah said. 
 
 Meanwhile, sources in the bureaucracy maintained that Tewari was not subjected to any harassment from any quarters. “Tewari was transferred from Bidar to Bengaluru recently and was given the prime posting as food commissioner. In fact, the department has been initiating a lot of reforms and Tewari’s predecessor Harsh Gupta too has been an honest and efficient officer. There have been no allegations related to any scam,” sources said.
 
 In the last three months since Tewari took over as food and civil supplies commissioner, he was on election duty to Punjab for a month and on an official training for over a month. “Politics should not blur the cause of Tewari’s death, a thorough inquiry has to be done,” a senior IAS officer said.
