NEW DELHI: On a day 13 children were killed after a train rammed into their school van near   in UP, the railway top brass seemed to be hedging over the target to eliminate all unmanned level crossing its network.

 
 A statement issued by railways said, "The very first meeting held by   after taking charge as railway minister was on safety issues on September 7, 2017. He had directed that all   (UMLCs) should be eliminated in the next one year."
 
 The statement was issued after Goyal took a meeting of senior railway officials, including railway board officials in evening on "Mission mode plan for elimination of unmanned level crossings". However, chairman railway board Ashwini Lohani said, "We will eliminate all UMLCs by March 31, 2020."
 
 At present, there are 5,792 unmanned and 19,507 manned crossings across the railway network. The statement issued after Goyal's meeting said, "Target for eliminating unmanned level crossings in 11 zones will be September 2018. For the remaining five zones targets will be set shortly." 
 
 This will be reviewed for early completion with respect to the earlier target of March, 2020, the ministry later clarified. In 2017-18, the cash-strapped transporter showed its best ever performance by eliminating — closing or manned — 1,565 such crossings. The target for 2018-19 is 1,500.
 
 Lohani said no step could be completely foolproof against negligence of people and urged them to be careful.
