NOIDA: The residents of   village in Dadri constitutency flocked to the polling booth on Saturday to elect not only their legislator but also to make their choice of chief minister. The village of   leader   has nearly 3,000 voters. Their booth was located in Mayawati Government Girls Inter College, Badalpur. Most residents said they supported Mayawati since she belonged to Badalpur and had also developed the village.

 Jagdish Nagar, a local resident, however, said that development work had completely stopped in the past five years. “There was lot of development when Mayawati was in power. She opened Government Girls Inter College, Govt Girls PG College, ITI institute. She also laid roads and built a hospital in the village. However, in the past five years, there is no development,” he said. The people of the village belong to the Gujjar, Thakur, Dalit and Muslim communities.
 
 Vijay Pal Singh, village chief, said local people were emotionally attached to Mayawati. “We feel that sherepresents us in state and national politics. Everybody in the village knows that she did a lot for the area when she was chief minister. We have voted for her this time also,” he said. 
 
 However, some people had a different opinion. Sachin Nagar, a local resident, said Mayawati spent a huge amount in making parks and statues. “If she had spent that money on development and created employment, we would have supported her. I prefer to vote for some candidate other than BSP’s,” he said.
