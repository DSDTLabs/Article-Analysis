THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Sharjah ruler  , who is on an official three-day visit to Kerala, has announced the release of Indian prisoners languishing in jails for non-criminal offences.

 Al Qasimi made the announcement on Tuesday at the Raj Bhawan during a function organised to conferred him with an honorary D.Litt.
 
 "Kerala chief minister   had asked me to consider the release of several Malayalees who had been languishing in Sharjah jail on charges of petty offences. Why only Malayalees or Indians? We have set free all such people from prisons this morning. And I was asked to let them leave Sharjah freely. Why should they leave the country? What if they are given good job opportunities? They will be free to work again in Sharjah," Qasimi said.
  
 The convocation was specially organised at the official residence of state governor who is also the chancellor of the Calicut University. Unlike the regular practice, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan attended the function as a special guest.
 
 "The conferment of the honorary degree on an extraordinary scholar like Sheikh Sulthan Bin Muhammed Al Qasimi goes a step beyond the recognition to academic excellence to further strengthen the international exposure that Kerala has always enjoyed. Quite often, special convocations are held to grant the seal of academic recognition to the contributions of scholars who may not be academician. However, Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammed Al Qasimi, who has received the honorary doctorate today, is an academician and polymath with two doctorate degrees and academic expertise traversing areas as varied as agriculture, history and political geography", said governor P Sathasivam.
  
 During the function, the Sharjah ruler vowed all support to the endeavours of Calicut University, which he referred to in his speech as his own university.
