RAJKOT: Dalits of Sara village in   of Surendranagar will host a protest on January 12 against cancellation of   of  , a leading NGO working for dalit’s rights in Gujarat. They are demanding explanation from central government on the rationale behind the ban.

 The NGO has been working in around 3,000 villages of Gujarat on various issues of dalit’s rights since last 27 years.
 
 Founder of Navsarjan Trust and human rights activist   told TOI, “If central government feels that Navsarjan was engaged in ‘anti-national’ activities, then it should slap sedition charges against me and Navsarjan Trust.”
 
 “People from Sara village met and told me that they plan to hold a protest. Villagers have collected funds to support the protest rally on January 12. Government has cancelled Navsarjan‘s FCRA licence as it used to raise voice of dalits and other weaker sections of the society. We have been working in Gujarat since last 27 years and we are doing same thing that we used to do in the past. Then, how come suddenly our activity became ‘anti-national?” questioned Macwan.
 
 After the ministry of home affairs cancelled the FCRA licence, Navsarjan Trust was barred from receiving funds from overseas sources.
 
 “I will put all our activity details before dalits in Sara village and ask them whether it is fair to ban us,” Macwan, a recipient of Robert F   in 2000, said.
 
 “Our NGO has played key role in seeking justice for atrocities against dalits in Gujarat and forced the government to act on various occasions. Navsarjan Trust was the first in the country to file a public interest litigation on existence of manual scavenging practices in 1996. Based on the PIL, the Union government brought a law banning manual scavenging in the country,” Macwan said.
