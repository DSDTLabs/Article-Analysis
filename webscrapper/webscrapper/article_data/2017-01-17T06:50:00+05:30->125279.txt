Nagpur: Khaperkheda   cracked the mysterious double   case with the arrest of a man on Sunday night, who had killed his wife and her lover over suspicion of an illicit relationship. 

 Cops who had recovered two dead bodies in Khaperkheda and Parshivni, had already registered offences of murders. The accused was produced before the court on Monday which remanded him to police custody till January 25.
 
 The woman, identified as Sonali Meshram, had got married to the accused Amar five years back. The couple had a three-year-old son from the marriage. However, their relationship had turned bitter since the last few months. Amar, who is a native of Walni, had suspected Sonali of having an illicit relationship with Kamleshsingh Thakur, alias John, who was living as a tenant at her father Gangadhar Wakpaijan’s place in Vishwas Nagar at Gittikhadan.
 
 "On January 9 at 8:30pm, Amar, a technician, picked up John from his home and took him to a bar in Koradi where they both consumed liquor, after which he drove an inebriated John to Walni where he smashed his head with a heavy stone. Having killed him, Amar threw the body in a canal behind Khaperkheda police station,” said senior PI M Chate.
 
 Sonali’s father identified John’s body from the tattoo of his nick name inked on left hand. The following morning, Amar took Sonali out of the house on pretext of taking her to relative’s place but instead he veered inside a forest adjoining Bokhra village. He then questioned Sonali about her relationship with John, which she denied, cops said. Annoyed, Amar strangulated her with a long scarf and also slit his wrist with a sharp blade before fleeing the spot.
