She added that she got to see so many new looks of him and that one day he would arrive in velvet, the next day in camouflage and at another time, he would don coloured caps and pants. Alia said she found him smashing and even started to seek his advice on whether she should buy something or whether something would work for her or not.

Ranbir also called himself the absolute epitome of fashion and style.
