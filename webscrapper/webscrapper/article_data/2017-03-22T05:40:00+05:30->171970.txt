Nagpur: Woman ACP Reena Janbandhu of Lakadganj division conducted raids on the city’s red light area on Tuesday , in which more than 90 women and their 48 customers were rounded up.

 The raid, the biggest since erstwhile zonal DCP Abhinash Kumar’s crackdown two years ago, was conducted with the help of Pachpaoli police, under PI Narendra Hiware, and additional manpower of around 60 personnel allotted by incumbent zonal DCP Shambaji Kadam. A Pune-based NGO was also involved in the action.
 
 The raid was conducted after cordoning off the entire locality by plugging 16 entry and exist points to the locality. The cops also ensured that the women were nabbed from the brothels after breaking open the locks.
 
 Several women were pulled out of concealed tunnels, illegally constructed within the brothels. Sources said that police were equipped with the map of the entire locality to know the topography before launching the raid. 
 
 Janbandhu said the feeding mothers and pregnant women would be separated from the rest of the lot. “We are yet to ascertain how many minors have been rescued among the ones who have been rounded up,” she said.
