KOCHI: A range of nuanced perspectives on the future of art education in India and the prospects for the Students' Biennale (SB) as an agent of intervention and engagement within the art institutional landscape in the country was reflected upon in a discussion at a symposium that began here on Saturday. 

 Titled 'The Future of Indian Art Education', the two-day conference that features participation from some of the biggest organizations in art learning including Foundation for Indian Contemporary Art (FICA) and the   (FIAE), and supported by Tata Trusts, the   and Ayana, Fort Kochi - was inaugurated by Fort Kochi sub-collector  . "Negotiating institutional attitudes to contemporary art is one of the long-term repercussions of the SB's interventions and the fraternities it forges," said FICA director  .
 
 Noting that it was thrilling to see the SB's growth and engagement with the contemporary, Tata Trusts Senior programme manager   said, "The SB reflects KBF's commitment to art education. The question is how to leverage the SB to influence art education?"
