PUNE: Muktangan Exploratory Science Centre has collaborated with the   to build an innovation hub that will be open to the public in a year.

 Addressing a news conference on Tuesday, the centre’s director   said, “The centre was established in 1992 and will celebrate its silver jubilee this year. On the occasion, we will also unveil the foundation plaque of the innovation hub.”
 
 The hub will be a centre for people to apply scientific theories and find solutions to commonplace problems. “I remember during a workshop, children proposed to make a foldable trolley to carry heavy schoolbags. These are the kinds of problems we expect people to come up with and try to look for a solution,” Bhide shared. 
 
 The innovation hub will aim not to make people learn all the concepts of science but to teach those interested how to use theoretical knowledge practically, he added.
 
 If interested, people can also pool in ideas and work with others on certain project. “It is not necessary that everyone should have an idea of their own, they can choose to join any ongoing project that they wish to work on,” Bhide said. Interested individuals will have to register with the centre and become a member. The hub will be open on weekends as well.
 
 Participants can avail raw materials required for their project from the exploratory and can seek advice from experts for their projects. The new initiative will be accommodated in a new complex close to the existing building. 
 
 Inter-disciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) lab will be set up to let people work on their ideas. There will also be theme-based short-duration workshops guided by experts from the respective fields.
 
 Through activities like Tod Phod Jod, students will be able to dismantle, assemble and remake gadgets,   will encourage students to create new things from household scrap. Through the programme Idea Box, various ideas will be discussed and those found practical will be implemented.
