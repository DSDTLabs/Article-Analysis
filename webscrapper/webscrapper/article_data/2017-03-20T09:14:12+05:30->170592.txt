HYDERABAD: People having to wait at railway crossings can hope to breathe easy sooner than later. This is because works to construct   (ROBs) at 20 railway crossings in various districts in the state will commence in the ensuing fiscal year.

 According to sources, the Telangana government will be writing to   authorities stating that it will bear half of the project cost. As per the initial estimates, the construction of ROBs at 20 locations is likely to cost 1,000 crore.
 
 Officials in the roads and buildings department said land acquisition will not be a problem as all these railway crossings are on the state highways. “Though all the 20 ROBs may not be completed in the 2017-18 fiscal, the idea is to start the process of land acquisition.These days, contractors are not coming forward to take up projects unless a clear project site is given to them,“ a senior official said.
 
 While the portion of the   over the   would be constructed by railway engineers, the remaining portions on either side would be the state's responsibility. The R&B officials along with revenue authorities will take up a survey of land required for the ROBs and the number of properties to be acquired.
