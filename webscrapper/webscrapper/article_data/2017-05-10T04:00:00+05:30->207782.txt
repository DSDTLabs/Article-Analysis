Vadodara: Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is set to lease out a series of plots sought by various agencies, including government organizations. 

 The civic body has finalized the valuation of these plots and is all set to monetize them.
 
 The general board of the VMC will take up the proposal for leasing these lands. 
 
 The standing committee of the civic body had recently taken up the proposal and passed it on to the board for a final nod as any property can be leased out only after a nod from the board.
 
 The VMC had valuated its plots at three different stages. The valuation of 15 plots was done in February 2015 while that of seven others was done in June 2015. Another set of 22 plots was valuated last month by the civic body.
 
 The VMC will be giving plots to government organizations at rates decided previously by the valuation committee in consultation with the representative of the valuation department of the state government. For leasing the plots to others, the civic body will hold auctions.
 
 Prominent organizations that have sought VMC plots on lease include Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (MGVCL), city police, State Bank of India, Central Excise and Customs department, government district library, MSTC Ltd as well as other religious and spiritual organizations.
 
 The VMC has a policy of giving the plots for a lease of 99 years. 
 
 The proposal prepared in this regard by the VMC administration has sought that the VMC commissioner should be allowed to conduct necessary procedures for auctioning the plots.
