NEW DELHI: The government is planning a review of the foreign direct investment ( ) regime on Wednesday with the issue listed on the agenda for the cabinet meeting.

 While details of the review were not immediately available, this is the first such exercise in recent months after PM   held preliminary discussions with key officials in July, with the government looking to remove key hurdles for investors. The latest exercise comes less than a fortnight before   courts investors in  , the Alpine ski resort that hosts the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting attended by the world’s top CEOs.
 
 The agenda for the meeting was circulated on Tuesday evening and the details remained sketchy with officials remaining tight-lipped. But given the government’s stand that India is one of the most open places to do business, significant changes are not expected especially in the wake of GST launch and demonetisation impacting cashdependent traders, a key vote bank for the BJP.
 
 In July, the government was toying with the idea of liberalising rules for sectors such as single-brand retail, by easing some of the compliance requirements, as well as construction. Since coming to power three-and-a-half years ago, the Narendra Modi administration has opened up sectors such as railways and defence to foreign competition while increasing the cap for insurance. In recent weeks, there has been talk of easier rules for telecom too.
