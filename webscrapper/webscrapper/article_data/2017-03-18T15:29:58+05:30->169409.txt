 Ashani Jain, one of the volunteers of the NGO shared, “The event will be open for all and participation will is free. The cyclothon will start from Indore zoo in the morning which will cover the areas till Regional Park and will end at the zoo.”
  
  
 
 City-based ornithologist Ajay Gadikar explains, “The idea of celebrating World Sparrow Day is to generate awareness about the conservation of these birds who are fit for residing in human habitation but have gotten extinct by 80 per cent, due to towers being built in residential areas.

 2. Water the leaves of the plants completely. Few birds love having a water bath in the droplets.
  
 3.Water-bowls and bird-feeders should be a garden essential.
