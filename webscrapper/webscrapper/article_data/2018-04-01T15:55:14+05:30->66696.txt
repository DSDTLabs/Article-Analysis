Thiruvananthapuram: As   for   hits a road block in the form of opposition from residents, who had earlier agreed to surrender land, the people associated with the development project speak about the need to upgrade the airport.

 Chairman of Airport Users’ Consultative Committee S N Raghuchandran Nair said that delay in land acquisition may affect the future development prospects in the district. 
 
 “I have been informed that the   planned for the   is better than the usual amount paid under the existing norms. If we do not act soon we will lose many development projects in the future. While chief minister has extended support for airport development, land acquisition is being delayed as some politicians want to play safe,” said Raghuchandran.
 
 The residents opposed the evaluation of land by district administration, which they alleged was part of the government move to reduce the compensation demanded by the land owners.
 
 The social impact assessment (SIA) study on the 18 acres in  , conducted by an expert committee, had stated land acquisition as a necessity for development of the airport.
 
 “We have around 30% of traffic from other districts in the state and another 30% from southern districts of Tamil Nadu, like Thirunelveli and Nagercoil. More than 16 lakh people will be benefited, if the residents in the area support the land acquisition move,” said Anilkumar Pandala, project director, Trivandrum Road Development Company Ltd (TRDCL), who had associated with several development projects at the airport.
 
 Convenor of Federation of Residents’ Associations Thiruvananthapuram (FRAT) M S Venugopal said that the airport has reached a stagnation point with regard to connectivity. “Due to delay in development project the airport is yet to utilize facilities like visa on arrival,” said Venugopal.
