 The veteran musician said he is "worried about world peace".
 "The 21st century should have been very peaceful and full of harmony. I think it is the worst time in the history of music. Because today people are killing each other on account of religion.
 My father who is my guru he taught me the way of life. He told me that all of us have a common god and we are of common race. We have racial problems. I wish the priest of every religion should give this message, that we have a common God and we have a common race... humanity, he added.
