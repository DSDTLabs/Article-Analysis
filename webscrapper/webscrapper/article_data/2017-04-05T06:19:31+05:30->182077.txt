AHMEDABAD: A special POCSO court on Tuesday ordered the registrar of the city sessions court to initiate criminal action against a man for providing false evidence in a case pertaining to alleged sodomy on his four-year-old son.

 The special judge who hears cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), H J Joshi, ordered that criminal action be initiated against a resident of Vatva in seven days’ time. This came after the man and his wife turned hostile during the trial. The judge said it would not be proper to take action against the mother, but the father’s behaviour warranted action.
 
 After witnesses retracted statements, the special court acquitted Shamshul Kamaluddin, who was accused and tried for sodomising the four-year old child. The alleged incident took place on July 28 last year in Vatva. The parents of the child accused Shamshul of sodomy, but the youth continued to defend himself by claiming that the boy fell down while crossing a door and was injured by the corner of a tile. During the trial, the parents concurred with the version put forth by the accused.
 
  This led the court to conclude that the evidence was not enough to convict the accused. But had the child’s parents told the truth to police, the accused would not have had to remain in jail for so long, said defence lawyer Anand Brahmbhatt.
