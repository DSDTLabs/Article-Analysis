HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao has announced that by the coming year and year and half, efforts will be made to supply 24-hour power to the   in the state. 

 The CM said to solve the Minimum Support Price problem permanently, in the coming budget, a Rs 500 crore fund will be created and the agriculture produce sold through farmers committees.
 
 Led by minister Tummala Nageswara Rao, oil palm farmers from Dammapeta mandal in Bhadradri Kothagudem district, where a palm oil plant has begun production, met the CM on Sunday. On the occasion, the CM addressed the farmers. “As on date, we are supplying nine-hour power supply to agriculture. Some farmers are using automatic starters. They are drawing more water than required. This is causing a two problems. Ground water level is depleting and with more water than required, even the yield is getting spoiled. Hence, we should stop the usage of automatic starters. We will have adequate supply of power in a year or year and half. Then we will try to give 24-hour power supply. Farmers will be able to draw water whenever they need,” the CM said. 
 
 However, energy officials have a different take on the CM’s statement. They said at present, the state is able to generate less than 4000 MW against the demand of 9000 MW. The situation is being salvaged by purchasing power from private power generators and from   The agriculture sector at present is consuming more than 11,000 million units every year to irrigate about one crore acres of land. If the government wants to give 24x7 free power, it has to step up generation to at least 10,000 MW. To purchase power to this extent, the state has to spend more than `8000 core every year.
