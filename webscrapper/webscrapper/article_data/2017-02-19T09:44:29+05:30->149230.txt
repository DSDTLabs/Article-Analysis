LUCKNOW: In the ever expanding urban expanse of Gomtinagar, three assembly   fall adjacent to each other. Divided into three parts—Gomtinagar, Phases I and II and   Extension—this segment of the state capital has collective population of 6 lakhs.

 Mithaiwala crossing comes under Lucknow Central, while Gomtinagar railway station falls under  . Similarly, Viraj Khand residents have houses and complexes that face each other and fall under different assembly segments.
 
 Many residents have no idea of who is the candidate but are clear about which party they support. “I not sure about who is the sitting MLA—Ashutosh Tandon, Gomti Yadav or Ravidas Malhotra. But I will support a national party like I have done in the past,” said Virat Khand IV resident Atul Singh, whose block borders on Bakshi Ka Talab constituency. The 33-year-old dentist, resident of Lucknow East constituency later found the names of candidates with the help of voters slip.
 
 There are also some have gained from the clubbing of constituencies. Vipul Khand III resident Amrit Kant Modwil is one such. “In 2012 polls, our colony fell under Bakshi Ka Talab constituency. Though we stay in one of the most organised residential pockets of the city, during elections it used to feel like we were living in the suburbs. Now we come under Lucknow Central,” said the corporate executive, excited to vote this time.
 
 Residents of apartments and buildings that have come up across Gwari railway crossing in Gomtinagar Extension and near Shaheed Path, will elect MLA for BKT constituency on Sunday. A lot of confusion prevails in residential colonies around Patrakarpuram where Lucknow East and Lucknow Central constituencies almost overlap each other in Vikas Khand and Viram Khand.
