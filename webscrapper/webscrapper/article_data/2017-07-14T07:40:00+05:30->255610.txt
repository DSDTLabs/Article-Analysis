NEW DELHI: On Thursday, the   (DMRC) and The Shri Ram School, Gurgaon launched ‘Swacch Chetna- An Eco Club’. The initiative will spread awareness about the protection of environment, as well as the importance of maintaining cleanliness. To mark the beginning of the initiative, a tree plantation activity was conducted on the DMRC premises along the Metro viaduct near Qutab Minar in Delhi.

 As many as 50 students from Class VI to XII of The Shri Ram School, along with DMRC personnel, planted saplings to spread greenery near Andheria mod. As part of the activity, the students have also created a Facebook page to spread awareness among their classmates and other children.
 
 “It is a year-long exercise, during which we will also involve under-privileged students from the neighbouring schools in the initiative. We will clean Iffco Chowk and Huda City Centre metro stations too,” said Abhir Bhalla, a student of The Shri Ram School.
 
 In course of the next few months, the eco-club will organise new activities like cleanliness drives at metro stations, street play competitions for children etc. A logo designing competition will also be organised for the children to decide the logo of the club. The idea is to involve the future citizens and make them aware of their responsibilities as the residents.
 
 “The Delhi Metro plans to take this initiative to more schools and involve a large number of students in spreading awareness about the environment and the importance to maintain cleanliness. Recently, it has constructed a park at Shastri Park called ‘Prakriti – Metro Park’ primarily using construction waste. Also, the Arjangarh   on Delhi Metro’s yellow line has been given an artistic makeover, with Indian and international artists painting various illustrations across the walls of the station on themes related to environment,” said the DMRC spokesperson.
