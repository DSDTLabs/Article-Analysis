BENGALURU: In yet another protectionist move, US senator Sherrod Brown from   has introduced a legislation to promote call centre jobs in the US. Brown’s  , called the US Call Centre Workers and Consumer Protection Act, requires US firms to identify the call centre’s location and allow the customer to be transferred to a call centre located in the US. 

 
 Online chronicler The Vindicator quoted part of the Act which read, “It requires US companies to notify the   before they relocate call centres and create a public list of companies that outsource call centre jobs.”  , managing attorney and founder of New York-based law firm Cyrus D Mehta & Partners, said these kind of legislations have been introduced before too in both the   and the House and have not gone anywhere. 
 
 “Although the Bill promotes call centre jobs in the US, it will pass on the costs to the US consumer ultimately and so Americans will not overall benefit. It also remains to be seen whether call centre operations in the US can function as efficiently and on a 24x7 basis like they do in India. Are there enough American call centre workers in a nearly full employment economy?” he asks. 
 
 The Vindicator quoted Brown as saying the US lost 200,000 call centre jobs between 2006 and 2014. Brown was said to be citing statistics from the federal Bureau of Labour Statistics. In India, call centres were once a big deal. But increasingly, a lot these jobs are getting automated and hiring in the segment has declined significantly.
