When it comes to Valentine’s Day, seeing #couplegoals is common sight just for the week. But actor   and his dancer-actor-fitness instructor wife   have decided to pursue a new goal that they aim to carry on for life.

 “Actors pursue a lifestyle in which we set short-term goals, work towards them and then give up on our fitness. This doesn’t benefit us in the long run. The idea that motivated us was to concentrate on one life-long goal to maintain a healthy lifestyle,” says Prajwal.
 
 The couple has adopted a new lifestyle choice — they have pledged to maintain not just a healthy body, but a happy state of mind as well. “We have begun a couple of activities together, which includes intermittent fasting, a new wellness online channel and also ensuring we do compulsory 20-minute high intensity training, whether it is together or separate,” says Ragini, adding, “One of our friends made a few lifestyle changes and we saw how it made her not just physically fitter, but happier as well. This was what sparked this idea in our minds. We are now working on small things, such as changing our eating habits, workouts and more to ensure that it becomes a part of our routine throughout our lives.”
 
 Prajwal points out that these are the kind of practices that actors like   have been following. “He doesn’t do any heavy-duty workouts. He follows a disciplined life that has a set routine, set eating habits and a set time at the gym. Just 20 minutes of dedicated time is more than enough,” he adds.
