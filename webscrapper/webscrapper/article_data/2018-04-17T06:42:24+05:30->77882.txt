PATNA: A six-year-old girl was allegedly raped after being kidnapped from   under the Mahnar police station area in   district on Sunday. Her family members took the survivor to the primary health centre (PHC) and the doctor on duty informed the police.

 The survivor’s mother on Monday lodged an FIR with Mahnar police station against one Raghunath Raut (30) and his brother Lalu Raut (22). 
 
 “Raghunath kidnapped the girl while she was playing near her house on Sunday evening. She was taken to Lalu, who later raped her. The duo later dropped the minor girl in front of her house and fled,” Mahnar SHO Abhay Kumar said quoting the FIR. As the minor was profusely bleeding, she was shifted to Vaishali sadar hospital, the SHO said. The medical report is awaited, he said.
 
 Raghunath works as a daily wager in Delhi while Lalu is also a labourer. The SHO said the complainant had a land dispute with the accused. The complainant had lodged an FIR against Bishwanath Raut, the father of the accused, with the Patepur police station almost two years ago. Bishwanath is still evading arrest, the SHO said.
