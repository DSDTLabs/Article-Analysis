RAJKOT: Six Pakistani nationals, including a minor, were apprehended with their boat from the Harami Nala near   off the Kutch coast by the Boarder Security Force ( ) on Thursday. They were held from the Indian side of the international border.

 According to sources, the BSF patrolling party spotted three boats doing fishing in Indian waters in Nal creek which is part of Sir Creek. “Upon seeing the BSF boats, the fishermen on board two boats sailed off into Pakistan side whereas six fishermen on board third boat were nabbed,” a senior BSF official said. 
 
 They were nabbed and sent to Dayapar for medical test. After tests they were handed over to Koteshwar police station officials, said sources.
 
 Those held were identified as Parvez Bachaya (20), Mustafa Bachaya (30), Allah Bachaya (60),   (30), Adreman Gullu (22) and an eight-year-old boy. All are residents of   in Sujawal district of Sindh province in Pakistan, said the BSF sources. No objectionable item was found on the six persons or in the boat.
 
 Given the sensitive nature of the area, even Indian fishermen are barred from catching fish in the creek. However, Pakistani fishermen often venture into Indian waters to catch fish and then sail off to their side.
