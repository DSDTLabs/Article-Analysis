 and   were greeted with loud cheers at the 'Half Girlfriend' music concert, which was held in the city. The evening was kicked off with singer Ash King’s rendition of the chartbuster Baarish, which set the tone for the evening. Singers and composers Rahul Mishra and Ami Mishra left the audience asking for more with their slow and pathos filled numbers Tu Hi Hai and Lost Without You respectively. Composer Rishi Rich had the crowd grooving to his beats when he belted out the peppy Mere Dil Mein. However, it was composer   with the lilting, Phir Bhi Tumko Chaahunga that left the audiences in a state of rapture. While Arjun was quick to point out that he had never received such an emotional response for his film’s music, Shraddha left everyone mesmerised with her version of Phir Bhi Tumko Chaahunga and added that it wasn’t an easy number to master. On a lighter note Arjun, who crooned a few lines from Baarish, added, “Ash King teri naukri khatre main hai.” The film’s cast was joined on stage by director Mohit Suri. Also present at the event was Yogesh Lakhani (Bright Outdoor Media Pvt. Ltd).   is produced by Balaji Motion pictures,   and Chetan Bhagat, and will hit screens May 19.
