MUMBAI: The city crime branch has busted a gang of four persons, including a software engineer, who were running an illegal   parallel to state-run  ,   (42), the main accused, is a former   lottery distributor who told police he quit it as it used to get him meagre profits.

 Police also   Alpesh Bhatiya (34), Zahirduddin Shaikh (45) and Narendra Kanani (52). Bhatiya and Kanani were franchisees. Police seized five computers, three printers, severs, eight mobile phones, routers, Rs 3.28 lakh and some documents. The 37th metropolitan magistrate court remanded the accused to police custody.
 
 The gang ran   Rajshree Lottery online, accepted bets and declared results on the lines of the state lottery. As they did not pay any money to the government, Badshah used to offer few prizes, and the rest were their profits. People wanting to place bets used to open an account by paying Rs500 and then they used to recharge accordingly. “The accused kept juniors in their back office. They would copy results of Rajshree and upload them on Badshah Rajshree’s website,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Nisar Tamboli.
 
 The gang has been running the racket for six months but no government agency detected it. Based on complaints from punters, the crime branch on Tuesday raided a hideout in Malvani and arrested two persons.
 
 “Badshah said he realized that there was a potential for huge profits if he and some Rajshree franchisees started their own illegal lottery. After taking into confidence at least seven franchisees, he with the help of a remote server in Canada, hosted the mobile application under the name of Badshah Rajshree and accepted bets,” said Chimaji Adhav, senior inspector (crime unit 11). 
 
 Assistant commissioner of police Abhay Shastri said they were looking for five more franchisees.
