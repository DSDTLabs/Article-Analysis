BHUBANESWAR:   in 
  might have died down, but the   was the most talked-about topic on Facebook, trending on the top of the   for most of Sunday. 

 Interestingly, it was an offensive Facebook remark on Hindu deities that had stoked the religious outrage in the small town on Thursday. The violence escalated on Friday with mob going on the rampage and torching several shops, leading to imposition of curfew. 
 
 However, situation appears to have turned calm on Sunday with the government relaxing the curfew for some hours in the day time. The Centre on Sunday dispatched three companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF) to Bhadrak to meet any exigencies. 
 
 “The situation is well under control. We have kept a close watch on the situation. Forces have been deployed across the town,” director general of police (DGP) Kunwar Brajesh Singh told TOI. Earlier in the day, state home secretary Asit Tripathy, who along with the DGP has been camping in Bhadrak, reviewed the situation and urged people to help the government restore peace and harmony. “We lifted the curfew for a few hours, allowing residents to purchase essential commodities,” Tripathy told media persons. 
 
 Police arrested nearly 30 persons from different communities that took the law into their hands and resorted to violence on Thursday and Friday. The state Crime Branch starts the probe into circulation of hate messages and provocative rumours on social media after the government realized the mischievous act was aimed at escalating violence. In Bhubaneswar, several civil society organisations took out peaceful processions, appealing for peace in Bhadrak.
