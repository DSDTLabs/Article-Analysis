CHENNAI: Effusive praise heaped on chief minister   and himself prompted an embarrassed   to appeal to his party MLA to quieten down. But it did not have the required effect. 

 Soon after the question hour began, AIADMK MLA V Panneerselvam began to praise former chief ministers M   and  . Then, he turned his attention on CM Palaniswami, calling him ‘kongu naattu thangam’ (gold from Kongu region). He hailed OPS as ‘jallikattu nayagan’ (hero of jallikattu). 
 
 As opposition MLAs sniggered, OPS got up and appealed to MLAs not to praise him. “I don’t want anyone to praise me. It is only because of Amma (Jayalalithaa) we are all here in the House,” said Panneerselvam. The chief minister, who was present in the assembly, remained silent. 
 
 Later, MLAs changed tack and remained respectful. While they sang paeans for MGR and Jayalalithaa, it was just ‘vanakkam’ for EPS and OPS. But, when AIADMK MLA K S Thennarasu again evoked the terms ‘kongu nattu thangam’ and ‘jallikattu nayagan’, speaker   cut him short.
