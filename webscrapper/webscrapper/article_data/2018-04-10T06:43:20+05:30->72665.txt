MUMBAI: Manisha Dhurve (18), a   girl from Dewada Ashram School who had never even stepped out of Chandrapur district in her life, is now ready to scale   Everest. Manisha and nine other tribal students, including three girls, will leave Mumbai for Kathmandu on Wednesday, on a 60-day   to scale the  .

 Manisha is a native of Zulwadi tribal hamlet in Jiwati taluka, which has just seven families. Her parents are farm labourers and she has three siblings. “Climbing Everest is the first serious goal of my life,” said the girl who was selected for the state tribal development initiative ‘Mission   2018’ and left her village for the first time for training in July 2017. 
 
  
  
 Vikas Soyam (21), another student selected for the mission, said he wants to join the army while Kavidas Katmode (18) said wants to become a politician. Both want to do something for the nation and society. 
 
 “We had not announced the plan earlier as we did not wish to divert students’ attention,” Manisha Verma, principal secretary, tribal development department, told TOI. “They were very shy and hesitant to mingle with others when they first came here. Now we have taught them basics of English and Hindi,” said Vimla Negi, manager of the tour.
 
 The department began to prepare for the mission in July 2017 by screening 60 students. They underwent training sessions at Bhongir in Hyderabad for rock climbing, a mountaineering course at Darjeeling and advanced winter mountaineering course at Leh and Ladhak this January. They were trained in adapting to the climate at Everest’s height of 29,000 feet by scaling peaks as high as 17,000 feet. They will be accompanied by a support staff, a manager, 15 Sherpas and one expert doctor.
