GAYA: Taking a serious view of the sudden spurt in illegal sand mining, perceived patronage of the local police and overloading on GT Road, zonal IG Naiyyer Hasnain Khan on Friday suspended   SHO   and shifted him out of Magadh police range. He will have to report at   during his suspension period. Departmental proceedings have also been ordered against him.

 The IG said SP (City) Awakash Kumar would camp in Sherghati to prevent illegal mining and dumping. “I have received several complaints and video footage of the sand mafia activities,” said Khan.
 
 Gupta is said to have a tainted record. Earlier, he was shunted to the police lines from the post of   police station SHO. According to police sources, he had recently took charge from IPS probationer Manjit Singh, who worked as the SHO for three months as part of his training. Illegal sand mining and other malpractices were effectively checked during Singh’s stint as the SHO.
 
 Soon after his departure, illegal sand miners set up dumps at several places on public land and lifted sand in heavily overloaded trucks, which could be seen parked at several places.
 
 Following reports of illegal sand mining, Gaya DM Kumar Ravi directed the mining officer to rein in the illegal sand miners. According to the DM, as per government’s order, riverbed mining has been stopped from July 1 and those found violating the ban would be sternly dealt with. The DM said those granted licence to stock sand have also been brought under the scanner.
