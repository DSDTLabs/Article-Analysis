Lucknow: Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have accused the state government of discrimination in power supply to people of the state on religious grounds but records of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) tell a different story.

 As per the power department's records, 13,500 megawatt (MW) power was supplied on   ul Fitr celebrated on July 6, 2016. Later, the same year, around 15,400 MW supply per day was maintained from October 28 to November 1 (from Dhanteras to Bhai Dooj). “This was despite the fact that demand was much higher during Eid which was celebrated in the summer season (July) as compared to October-November when   conditions are better and use of air-conditioners is less,” said a senior officer privy to the demand and supply of power in the state.
 
 Government officers are believed to have even fished out tweets that were made by the UP chief minister’s official handle about directives to ensure 24-hour power supply during festivals, especially   and Holi, apart from Eid and other similar occasions. 
 
 Similarly, allegations of discrimination over allocation of funds for graveyards and cremation grounds (meant for last rites of Muslims and Hindus, respectively) have also come under scrutiny with the government having allocated funds for both sites across the state in proportion to the area that the two cover.
 
 With regards to financial assistance, government has extended help to places of worship from all religions and sects. The list includes names of Jain Mandir Hastinapur, Deoband, Shukratal (Muzaffarnagar), Panch Pyara Hastinapur (a Sikh), Dargaha Alia Najabae Hind Najibabad (Bijnore), Deva Sharif (Barabanki), Vrindavan (Mathura), Nami Sharayan (Sitapur), Dargarh Kichoha Sharif (Ambedkarnagar), Sarnath (Varanasi) and Kasia (Kushinagar).
