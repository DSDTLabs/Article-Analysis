BENGALURU: Aadhaar based transactions are the way forward if the country wants to go cashless, given that nearly 350 million people still have no access to mobile phones, former chairman of   (UIDAI) Nandan   said on Friday. Pointing out how 600 million people own mobile phones in India, Nilekani said: “Of these, 250 million are   and 350 million are feature ones.“

 Stating that Aadhaar-based payments can work on both phones, Nilekani said no other country has a mobile payment system that is inter-operable between smartphones and feature ones. “Therefore, Aadhaar becomes a connection between people who have phones and those who don't,“ he pointed out.
 
 He said issues such as cost of transaction for digital payments need to be sorted out even as infrastructure at the consumer-end is ready.
