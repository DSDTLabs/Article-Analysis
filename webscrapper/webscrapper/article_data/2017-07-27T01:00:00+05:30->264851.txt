 is all set to forge a ‘Pavitra Rishta’ in her real life. The actress, who played Ankita Lokhande’s youngest sister in the popular TV show, will tie the knot with director   in November. Prarthana reveals, “I will get engaged in August and the wedding is on November 14. It’s an arranged marriage; I met Abhishek through a   bureau. We are keen to have a destination wedding.” 

 Interestingly, Prarthana says that she never wanted to marry an actor. “I never aspired to become an actor myself, I wanted to be a writer-director. I can’t relate to most actors, as all they talk about is fitness and make-up. I am more inclined towards filmmaking; I believe that’s where the real work happens. I like conversing with directors and writers.” 
 
 Not surprising then, that she hit it off with Abhishek from the word go. “Being from the same industry, it’s easy for us to understand each other. Many things are common between us; we keep talking about the industry as we both are into films.”
 
 After quitting ' ' mid-way, Prarthana shifted her focus to regional and Hindi films. “I don’t want to take up a TV show because I love doing films. I will continue working after marriage. Abhishek is a writer-director and he doesn’t want me to quit acting.”
