BHOPAL: Friday has a special significance for movie buffs, but not this week. Not in MP.

 After the cancellation of   in MP, it will be a rare Friday when no new Bollywood flick is released. Two other films, including Akshay Kumar’s Padman, which was largely been shot on the banks of Narmada in MP, were slated for release this Friday but it was pushed back nationwide to make space for Padmaavat.
 
 President of Central Cine Circuit Association, Jai   expressed regret and said that if governments continue to conduct themselves in the manner they have done in this case, cinema industry would die.
 
 “Once in a while you have films like Padmaavat, whose box office success seems certain. If such films aren’t allowed to be screened under
 
 pressure from fringe groups, how will the industry survive? Padmaavat was released on 80 screens in Mumbai, ruled by   and  , but there is no problem. I am sure cinema owners in MP will have to pay their staff this week from their own pockets.”
 
 “If cinema hall owners have to face threat on every film, why would they run cinema halls. Selling the cinema hall land to realtors is a better proposition”, he said. He said that it’s not about films and cinema halls only, film-making in India means big business with livelihood of so many people involved and government should not allow it to die like this.
 
 Secretary of  , Azizuddin, who was keen to release ‘Padmaavat’ on his three screens at Raj and Alpana cinema halls, said: “We shall continue with the film already being screened at the two cinema halls”.
