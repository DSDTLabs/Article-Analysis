HUBBALLI: The assembly elections have aggravated people's miseries with loads of garbage piling up on the roadsides. When citizens complain, officials say they're busy with election work.

 Corporators, too, do no attend to the problem, citing model code of conduct. Left with no other choice, aggrieved citizens are registering their complaints with the   control room. On an average, the control room is receiving 20 complaints on the issue a day.
 
 A glimpse at roadsides at places like Kamaripeth, Toravihakkal, near Nehru stadium,   road, near Town Hall, Ashok Nagar, Vijay Nagar, Raj Nagar, Gokul Road and Keshwapur presents unpleasant sights.
 
 Maltesh Gudimani, who is incharge of the HDMC control room, said complaints are forwarded to the officials. "After attending to the complaints, officials on the field inform us and we close the complaints," he informed.
 
 Sources said that the intesified protest by pourakarmikas working on contractual basis has turned the situation worse. The civic worker struck work for three days in March and also in the first week of April.
 
 A contract civic worker said that garbage disposal suffered due to repeated protests and holiday on Wednesday. "More than 50 tractors are needed to life garbage in the twin cities," he said.
 
 Ibrahim Maigur, commissioner, HDMC, said that in a recent meeting, officials were instructed not to waste time in taking up water and garbage disposable issues. "I will look into the matter and solve the problem," he added.
