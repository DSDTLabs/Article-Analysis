NAGPUR:   seems to have caught the attention of the state as well as central governments as both have chalked out plans to create awareness. Even though the state government has been observing traffic safety fortnight for the last couple of years, the Centre too has drawn up a list of programmes to be organized during the week starting January 9.

 A notification to that effect from the   has been received by the   and regional transport office directing the authorities to conduct weeklong programmes to create road safety awareness. Interestingly, the state government is yet to issue any notification in this regard.
 
 The theme for the road safety week is ‘Accident is painful, safety is gainful’. The ministry of road transport and highways has sought public participation, mainly of citizen groups and students. 
 
 In the letter, the Union ministry has stressed the need to involve people — mostly youth and children — to spread awareness about road safety. Some of the activities include special messages from chief ministers, panel discussions on road safety on   and television, public announcements about road safety at important intersections using mobile vans, display of banners, road signs, dos and don'ts regarding road safety and bringing out pamphlets for young road users and drivers to educate them about safety aspects.
 
 The letter also stressed on the involvement of all concerned agencies like police, health, education, PWD, etc, and other field agencies like transport and district authorities for a proactive enforcement drive.
 
 The ministry has also asked the state government to submit an action taken report (against traffic rule offenders) to the Centre by January 31.
