 Citizen feedback plays a crucial role in deciding the cleanliness ranking of the 4,041 cities in the country in the annual   done by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. The rankings are likely to be out next month. 
 
 Feedback can be given through telephone calls, face-to-face interviews, interactive voice response, using the Swacchh Survekshan web portal and the specially-designed mobile application. The BMC aggressively marketed the survey this year, encouraging people to download the mobile   called Swachhata-MoHUA to post their responses.
 
 Almost 400 out of the 4,000 marks in the competition are for the number of downloads and use of the app. On December 6, downloads numbered 6,000 and are 99,000 now.
 
 This year’s surge in feedback came after Mumbai’s ranking had dropped to 29th in the   Survekshan in 2017 from 10th a year before. The BMC scored the least, 299 out of 600, for citizen feedback in 2017.
 
 In Vasai-Virar, feedback came from 5,588 people and in Mira-Bhayandar, from 4,879. Kalyan-Dombivli had 3,232 responses, Ulhasnagar 1,675, Panvel 967 and Pen 433.
