 According to police, Ibrahim's son Sheikh Shahzaib, an auto driver, had a tiff with   alias Mujju on April 10. "On April 10, Shahzaib along with his friends went to Kishanbagh for lunch. As they were returning home, they overtook Mujahid, who was walking on the road, in a zig-zag manner. Irked by their behaviour, Mujahid stopped the auto. Shahzaib and Mujahid had a heated argument over the former's rash driving," Rajendranagar inspector G Suresh said.
 
 Bearing a grudge against the auto driver, Mujahid, his nephew Imran and his friend went to Shahzaib's house around 11.30pm on Friday. "Mujahid was in an inebriated condition. As Shahzaib was not at home, his parents opened the door. Mujahid and his associates created nuisance and claimed they came to beat up their son. When they tried to misbehave with his wife, Ibrahim intervened and asked them to get out," police added.
 
 They dragged Ibrahim out of the house and rained blows, especially on his chest. Around 12.30am, Ibrahim and his wife went to the Rajendranagar police station to lodge a complaint. However, Ibrahim fell ill there and was shifted to Usha Mohan Hospital.
 
 "He fell unconscious and a doctor advised them to shift him to a better hospital. Ibrahim was then shifted to  , where doctors declared him brought dead. He sustained internal injuries and died of internal bleeding," the officer added.
 
 Police have booked the three, who are absconding, under Sections 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 324 (Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 302 (murder) of the IPC and launched a manhunt to nab them.
