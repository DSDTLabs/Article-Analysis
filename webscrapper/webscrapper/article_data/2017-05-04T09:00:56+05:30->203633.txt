NEW DELHI: The group of   and their teachers, who had come to India as part of an “exchange for change” initiative organised by the NGO Routes 2 Roots, have had to hastily depart. They had barely settled into Delhi, and were planning to visit the Taj Mahal, but had to cut short their trip and head   across the border. 

 After an advisory from the home ministry, the NGO issued a statement saying: ‘keeping in mind the security and   of fellow Indians, the delegation has been sent back to Lahore safely.”
 
 While the founders of the initiative regretfully spoke of the “prevailing conditions”, the children went back with heavy hearts, unable to meet their Indian pen pals or give them the personalised gifts. 
 
 Union ministry of external affairs spokesperson Gopal Baglay said, “Some NGO had invited Pakistani schoolchildren and we advised it that this is not the right time for such exchange programmes.”
 
 The head of the Lahore Grammar School, Shazia Iqbal, wrote to Tina Vachani, general secretary of Routes 2 Roots, thanking her and the Indian government for “ensuring a smooth and safe transfer of the children across the border”. The trip, part of a regular exchange, had been postponed earlier this year after the surgical strikes.
