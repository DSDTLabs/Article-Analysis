RAJKOT: Chief district judge D T Soni, who presided over the   on Friday, ordered Rs 47.90 lakh compensation to the kin of a man who died in a road accident 10 years ago. 

 The tribunal ordered the   to pay the amount with 8% interest and deposit the amount with the tribunal within 30 days. The interest amount is estimated to be about Rs 40 lakh.
 
 According to the case detail, 32-year-old Deven   was riding a motorcycle when he was hit by a private bus moving on the wrong side of the road near Vanthli in Junagadh on February 25, 2008. He sustained severe head injuries and died on the spot. He was survived by wife, a daughter and parents.
 
 Deven had got dealership of the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in Vanthli just two years before his death. He did not file income tax return and on that basis the insurance company rejected his family’s income claim before the court. The family had demanded compensation of Rs 1.5 crore.
 
 Advocate for Deven’s family Narendra Mulchandani said, “Victim’s father filed two year’s income tax return together, which was allowed as per the law. We submitted the evidence of commission he had received from the IOC and convinced the court that he was earning nearly Rs 3 lakh per year. As per Supreme Court’s order, 40% increase in income was calculated and considering victim’s age, the court ordered Rs 47.90 lakh compensation.” 
 
 Deven’s grandfather Hudka Muljibhai Kalidas had won assembly election on   ticket in 1980 from   constituency.
