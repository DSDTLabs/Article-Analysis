NEW DELHI: PM   has set March 2019 as deadline for all municipalities to get online to grant permission for construction of  . He also asked all agencies to complete geo-tagging of urban infrastructure being built under the urban rejuvenation mission,  , by this month-end so their progress can be reviewed.

 
 Modi issued these directions during his recent web-based interaction with the secretaries to various ministries and chief secretaries of states during the monthly PRAGATI meet. According to the urban affairs ministry, out of the 500 mission cities and towns, 370 municipal bodies have gone online for granting building permission. This system enables people to get the requisite permission by placing an online application rather than visiting municipal offices. This is one of the major thrust areas of government under its “ease of doing business” initiative.
 
 Sources said the geo-tagging of under-construction projects have been taken up to assess the progress as part of strict monitoring for timely completion of work. 
 
 Poor monitoring was one of the hallmarks of the earlier avatar of AMRUT, which   had launched in the form of JNNURM.
