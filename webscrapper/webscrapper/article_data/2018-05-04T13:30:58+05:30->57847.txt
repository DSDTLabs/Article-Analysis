The meaning of ITC can be easily understood when we take the words ‘input’ and ‘tax credit into consideration’. Inputs are materials or services that a manufacturer purchases in order to manufacture his product or services, which is his output.

 Tax credit means the tax a producer was able to reduce while paying his tax on output.
 
    means that when a manufacturer pays the tax on his output, he can deduct the tax he previously paid on the input he purchased. Here, while paying the tax on his output, he can deduct or take credit for the tax he paid while purchasing inputs.
 
 Input tax credit will not be available for goods or services exclusively used for personal use, exempt supplies and supplies for which ITC is specifically not available
 
 To calculate the input tax credit applicable, one can follow these steps:
 
 1) Find out if you are eligible to claim an ITC.
 
 2) Determine the percentage of use in your commercial activity.
 
 3) Determine the amount of GST/HST you can claim as an ITC for different type of expenses.
 
 4) Calculate using the regular or simplified method.
