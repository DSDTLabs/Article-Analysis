HYDERABAD: More than 10 days after the desperate efforts of a family to bring back their daughter, Mohammadi  , languishing in Pakistan was brought to light, city police on Saturday contacted her father in Bandlaguda and took all the details.

 The Special Branch officials contacted Mohammed  , father of Begum, and took from him the details about Begum's marriage to a Pakistan national Mohammed Younis, who concealed his actual nationality and cheated her by claiming to be from  .
 
 â€œMy statement was taken by the police and I was asked to come to meet some senior officer in SB, Purani Haveli. This is the first time government official contacted us but till now there is no response from the ministry of external affairs,'' Akbar told TOI. Akbar nearly 15 days ago sent an email to external affairs minister   seeking her help to bring back Mohammadi Begum.
 
 Begum says she is facing torture at the hands of Younis and wants to return to Hyderabad. Her passport too has expired. She has been pleading her father over phone for the last three months to help her return to India.
