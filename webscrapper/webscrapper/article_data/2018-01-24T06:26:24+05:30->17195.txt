HYDERABAD: To ensure last mile connectivity at   stations, Telangana chief secretary, SP Singh, directed the Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) authorities to introduce electric vehicles and non-polluting vehicles at all Metro stations at the earliest. 

 The chief secretary directed   officials to enhance the   feeder services. After inauguration of Metro rail services, RTC on a pilot basis introduced about 50 vehicles to operate from Metro stations from identified colonies. But of the 24 operational Metro stations, many still do not have feeder services and commuters have to depend on autos and private cabs.
 
 A review meeting was held with Metro rail authorities on Tuesday on improvement of feeder services and last mile connectivity for the 30km Metro rail stretch between Nagole and Miyapur, which was inaugurated about two months ago by Prime Minister  . According to sources, the CS asked HMRL and Roads and Buildings department to conduct a quick study to get feedback from Metro commuters, station wise mapping with frequency details and match the frequency of RTC feeder services and Metro trains so as to provide end to end connectivity for commuters.
 
 SP Singh directed the HMRL to complete phase-I by the end of this year. He also asked HMRL managing director,  , to initiate preparatory activity for determining the broad contours of Metro phase-II expansion programme, so as to approach Central government for sanction of Metro phase-II.
