Where some actors these days play sports for a team or even became an owner of a team there are actors like   who believe in launching a sports academy to cater to everyone who loves sports. The actor comedian who makes the nation laugh in his show Comedy Nights Bachao has an emotional attachment to sports which isn't known to all. 
Being a sports lover since childhood, Mubeen always had the desire to learn sports but due to his family's financial situation the actor had to suppress his dreams. Today when the actor is well established on television, Mubeen along with his brother has now opened their own sports academy named '  '. The academy has been opened to all with high end equipment's and talented coaches. 
 Mubeen Saudagar shared, "Since childhood I always had a desire to do something in sports but at that time my family had some financial limitations. I always had a dream that one day I will build an academy where people can learn sports and fulfil their desires. With God's grace, me and my brother have formed Target Sports academy and I wish that from henceforth, everybody gets to live their dream without any obstacles. We want to develop sports in this nation and make it more sports-friendly one."
