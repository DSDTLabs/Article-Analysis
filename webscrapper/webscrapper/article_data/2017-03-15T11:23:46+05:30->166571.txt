BHOPAL: After plots and land, buying an   will be an even costlier affair from April 1 if the collector rate   in. 

 The guidelines propose a steeper hike for   than open plots. Over 150 colonies in Bhopal are expected to be impacted by the rise in property registration fee.
 
 The hike, suggested by the district evaluation committee, is based on an analysis of areas where property registration rates were higher than the prevailing collector rate. In absolute measure, the committee has come down hard on 43 locations where properties were registered at 5% or more than prevailing collector rate, say sources.
 
 The fee for registering a flat has been increased by 5% to 20% â€” the steepest in three years. Until 2014,   for all floors of an apartment varied, but later there was a flat rate for every floor. This in effect, led to a near 25% increase in collector rate of many properties.
 
 Tuesday was the final day for receiving objections or suggestions for the proposed collector rate guidelines for Bhopal. Once cleared by the district evaluation committee, the new guidelines will come into effect after approval from the state government. Sources said that about 50 objections and suggestions were received until Tuesday evening.
 
 The colonies likely to be impacted are concentrated around Budhwara in the heart of the walled city, Sehore-Indore Road, Kotra Sultanabad, Nehru Nagar and Bawadiya Kalan. 
 
 Objections have been raised over some colonies that have been excluded from the hike. It includes apartments near Katara Hills, where 54% property registrations were reported at higher rates. Another instance is Jail Road (near Gandhinagar) where 114 of 753 property registrations were 40% higher than prevailing rates.
