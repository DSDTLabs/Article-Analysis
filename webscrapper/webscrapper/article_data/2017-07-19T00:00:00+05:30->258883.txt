They are like Tom and Jerry” — this is how director   explains the characters of P Ravi Shankar and   in Dhairyam. With his deep voice and imposing build, Ravi Shankar’s presence is such that when he is onscreen, it is impossible to miss him. And when such a person plays a cop — one with negative shades at that — then it is bound to send shivers down the spine of others onscreen. But this is only one side of his role in  , says the actor, adding, “My character is interesting in the sense that you get to see the other side of police officers through him — what they are like at home. My character is rough and tough while on the job, but when he is at home, you see a tamer side, since he is scared of his wife. So, I am not just a villain; my character is entertaining as well since he has comical shades.”

 Although Ravi Shankar has made friendly appearances in Ajai’s earlier films, this is the first time that he has a full-fledged role alongside him. So, what was Ajai like on the set? “He is a very nice human being. Ajai knows his job well, so it was nice working with him. I’m famous for my dialogues, and what is interesting is that in Dhairyam, the counter dialogues from Ajai are also very powerful,” he says.
 
 
  
 
 Having dabbled in comedy quite a bit, does Ravi Shankar want to do an out-and-out comedy role someday? “Yes,” he replies quickly. But does his voice and build keep him from getting such roles? “Not really. If you take Victory or Adyaksha, for e.g., they are comedy films, and luckily I fit the bill in both. Having said that, I am waiting to do Kamal Haasan-type comedies, such as Panchathantiram or even Golmaal. I want to try new genres. As an actor, you keep waiting for new scripts and characters. But I can’t complain because I have not been getting routine villain characters; mine always have lighter shades to them.”
