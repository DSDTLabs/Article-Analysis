NEW DELHI: The city   will hold a   workers’   on March 5 to revitalise its organisational structure ahead of the municipal polls. 

 BJP members said the party was trying to strengthen its booth-level organisation and identify key issues early. A minimum of five people from each booth—there are 13,372 booths in the three corporations—will attend the event where senior functionaries will discuss micromanagement of booths and mobilisation on the polling day. 
 
 The state executive finalised the plan for the event on Tuesday. “We are expecting close to 50,000-60,000 booth workers to turn up,” said  , vice-president of  . These workers will prepare a detailed list of pressing issues in their areas, profile of voters based on communities and a plan for mobilisation. “These people will be involved in booth management throughout the process. We are in the process of reviewing the booth-level teams,” said a functionary. 
 
 BJP, which has been ruling the corporations since a decade, is looking at problem areas to address the anti-incumbency factor, said a source. With AAP contesting its first full-fledged municipal polls and   working hard to revive itself, BJP is leaving no stone unturned to avoid a repeat of the 2015 assembly polls. The party is focusing on expanding its voter base in AAP’s strongholds—slum clusters and unauthorised colonies as after delimitation, the number of wards with a high percentage of slum clusters and unauthorised colonies have gone up. 
 
 Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari has asked the district presidents to build a team of youth workers at each booth. “Our aim is ‘Ek booth, 10 youth’. These teams will help us connect with people,” he said.
