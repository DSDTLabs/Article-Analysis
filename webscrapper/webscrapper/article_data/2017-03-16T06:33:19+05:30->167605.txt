US President   slammed rapper   over the use of a gun against a Trump look-alike in his new music video, media reports said.

 In the music video for the song "Lavender", Snoop points a prop gun loaded with confetti at a clown-faced man dressed up to resemble the president, ABC news reported.
 
 "Can you imagine what the outcry would be if SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time!" Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning.
 
  
  
 
 The full video features a take on the world today with everyone from the police to normal residents wearing clown paint on their faces. It also shows satire re-enactments of police shooting civilians with other prop guns firing confetti, not bullets.
 
 Towards the end of the video, Snoop holds a gun up to the caricature of Trump's head and pulls the trigger, only to have a "bang" flag come out of the pistol.
 
 Florida Senator Marco Rubio voiced his concern, telling TMZ that presidents "have been assassinated before in this country, so anything like that, you have to be very careful about".
 
 Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen, said on Tuesday that the video is "disgraceful" and that the rapper should apologize to the President, Efe news reported.
 
 "There's absolutely nothing funny about an assassination attempt on a president, and I'm really shocked at him, because I thought he was better than that," Cohen said.
 
 In recent months, Trump several times has created controversy by firing off vindictive Twitter salvoes at key cultural icons, including Meryl Streep, Arnold Schwarzeneggar and the hit musical Hamilton.
