CHENNAI: With   stock fast depleting and just enough to last five days, state power minister   has written to coal and railway minister   to come to the rescue by alloting more   to evacuate coal from the mines.

 “We have been facing the problem of getting adequate rakes to evacuate coal from the mines for more than a month. Now, we also need more coal as the power demand is increasing each day with the rise in temperature,” said a senior   official. 
 
 The power demand is expected to touch 16,000MW by May. “After two years, the demand has once again crossed 15,000MW as many farmers are using the motors to draw groundwater. The domestic demand is also increasing with many using air conditioners,” said the official.
 
 “The coal stock used to be for 15 days but due to shortage of railway rakes, the stock has come down. If the demand continues to be high, we will need not less than 72,000 tonnes of coal per day and to evacuate that much quantity we need at least 20 rakes,” said the official. 
 
 Until the middle of next month, Tangedco is dependent only on thermal units for power supply. Power cost in electricity exchange has also increased to Rs 8 per unit, so Tangedco has to be more prudent in purchasing power. “We are able to get only 13 to 14 rakes to evacuate coal. The present situation is manageable and we are hoping that the railway minister will allot more rakes for evacuating coal after the receipt of the letter,” said a Tangedco official. 
 
 Tangedco is also importing coal but that is sufficient to meet only for 20%-30% of the thermal units’ requirements. “Purchasing power from the electricity exchange has become costly. With many northern states demanding power, the cost at the exchange has increased. Swapping of power from Punjab and Chhattisgarh will also stop as the demand there will also increase,” said the official.
