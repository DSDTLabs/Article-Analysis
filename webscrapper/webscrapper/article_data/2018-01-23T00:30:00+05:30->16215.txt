Bengaluru: The high court on Monday directed the city police commissioner to submit periodical reports on the progress made by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up to look into the case of missing techie, Kumar Ajitabh. Justice A S Bopanna gave this direction while asking commissioner T Suneel Kumar to submit a brief report on Monday.

 Earlier, additional advocate general (AAG) A G Shivanna submitted a report on behalf of the SIT. He told the court that the SIT had consulted the parents of the techie and they require two more weeks to submit a progress report.
 
 However, the court granted only a week, saying no progress has been made so far, except for constituting the SIT. “Investigation may go on but a weekly report is necessary to know the developments. If the commissioner feels disclosing details may derail the probe, he may submit it in a sealed cover,” the judge said.
 
 The court noted that instead of SIT submitting a voluminous report, the commissioner may give a brief report after going through the inputs and also analyzing as to whether he is satisfied with the probe or not. 
 
 Police said the person, who made the last call to Ajitabh, had purchased the cellphone and sim card submitting a fake identity proof and both appear to have been destroyed later.
