BHOPAL: Doctors and students have decided to attend the   ( ) protest rally against Union government’s proposed   ( ) bill.

  As per the proposed  , its members will be nominated by the government and need not be from the medical field. Doctors are objecting to the new amendment that would allow AYUSH and other non-MBBS doctors to prescribe allopathic drugs.
 
 At a press conference on Saturday, IMA national president Dr Ravi Wankhede described the NMC bill as ‘anti-people and anti-patient’. Dr Wankhede was in   as a part of the second phase of ‘Bharat-Yatra’ being taken out as a mark of protest against the Bill. “After March11, a cycle rally will be launched from allfour corners of thecountry and it will culminate in New Delhi on March 25 where a maha-panchayat in protest of the NMC Bill will be held,” he said. Currently, the Bill is with the parliamentary standing committee and IMA anticipates that Bill will be placed in the House in the current session for approval.
 
 IMA MP chapter president and cardiologist Dr Rajiv Gupta said, “We respect AYUSH and other disciplines. However, by allowing non-MBBS doctors to prescribe allopathic medication, patients’ interest is being undermined. People in rural and urban areas, both have the right to best possible healthcare solutions.”
 
 NMC Bill also seeks to replace the Medical Council of India (MCI). It would cripple functioning of medical profession, the association alleged.
