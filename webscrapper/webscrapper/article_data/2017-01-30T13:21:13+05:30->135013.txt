In Uttar Pradesh, which will elect a new legislative assembly in February-March, every MLA represents around 5.4 lakh constituents. The number of seats in the Lok Sabha as well as in the legislative assemblies has been derived on the basis of the 1971 census and will remain unaltered till the first census taken after 2026. Because of the population difference and varied population growth rates, the number of people per MLA is not equal across states. Sikkim, for instance, has 27 times less people per seat compared with UP.
