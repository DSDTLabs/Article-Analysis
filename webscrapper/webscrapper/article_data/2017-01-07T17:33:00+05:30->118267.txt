KOLKATA: Railway Board member (traffic)   held a high-level safety meeting with   general manager M C Chauhan and other senior officers on Friday before taking rides in motormen's cabins in trains and speaking to commuters at stations.

 "He went to the Park Street station and spoke to people at the booking counter. He wanted to know the experiences of passengers and if they had any problems. He then traveled to Mahanayak Uttam Kumar and spoke to more passengers. Some passengers said that there should be more AC rakes and the member (technical) said that Metro is gradually replacing old rakes with AC ones," said Indrani Banerjee, CPRO, Metro Railway.
 
 At Mahanayak Uttam Kumar, Jamshed also visited food stalls outside the platforms and interacted with passengers. He asked a person munching on a chicken patty whether it tasted nice. The man told him that it would have tasted better had it been warmer. Jamshed then directed the food stall owner to warm a fresh patty properly and serve it to the customer. He also urged traffic department officials to keep tabs on the kind of service passengers receive.
