HYDERABAD:It's now official. It is the 'questionable' quality of drugs and sterile nature of intravenous (IV) fluid dextrose that has claimed the lives of five pregnant women soon after delivery at state-run   in the city during January-February this year, according to the final report of the expert panel of   

 The expert team, however, gave a clean chit to the doctors of Niloufer Hospital absolving them of medical negligence. The doctors had performed caesarean section on the women.
 
 The   triggered outrage forcing the state government to order a probe by an expert team comprising five senior doctors. An NGO had approached the   (SHRC), which directed the state government to submit its report.
 
 The expert committee also stated that the culture reports of all operation theatres (OTs) were sterile. This in essence rules out nosocomial or hospital acquired infection while the C-sections were being performed. However, the team pointed fingers at the "questionable quality of drugs and sterile nature of IV fluid" namely dextrose, stating that it is the most likely cause of maternal deaths.
 
 "Finally, we conclude that clinically there is a strong case for suspicion on the questionable quality of drugs and sterile nature of intravenous fluids especially dextrose containing solutions, which might be the cause for all the maternal deaths that occurred at Niloufer Hospital from January 28 to February 4, 2017," said the panel.
