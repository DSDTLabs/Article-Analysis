GUNTUR: Unveiling another grand plan on the lines of   project, chief minister Chandrababu   on Saturday said his government wants to construct a mega reservoir in Palnadu to address the water woes of the parched region. But, the reservoir will take time as it would require thousands of crores. Speaking after laying the foundation stone for an ST minority boys residential school in Gollapadu on Saturday, the CM said: “If we can build a reservoir in Palnadu, we can give water to   left and right canals.“ Buoyed by 100 per cent central funding for Polavaram dam, he said the project will be completed by 2019. “By 2018, we will provide water to Krishna, Guntur and Prakasam districts through gravity using the right main canal and to Visakhapatnam through the left main canal. Later, we will also bring Godavari water to river Penna,“ he asserted. 

 Rebutting the charges of opposition leaders that he is afraid of the Union government, he said: “I know what is going on at the Centre and how to get things done. Had I not confronted with the Centre would it have been possible for Polavaram project to become a reality.“ Articulating that his vision and pro-active pursuit had resulted in AP getting the special package, he thundered: “Some people are making a big issue out of special category status (SCS). They said industries would get incentives if SCS is accorded. As an economics graduate, I challenge them to tell me under which sections would incentives be given.“
 
 Naidu went on to make a fervent appeal to the people to have cent per cent belief in him and assured that he would make AP one of the best states. “People should take a cue from farmers of   who gave `40,000 worth land for free because of the faith in me,“ he explained.
