 scientists have developed a new structure inspired by   skin that could improve the aerodynamic performance of planes, wind turbines, drones and cars. The study published in the Journal of the   sheds light on a decades-old mystery about sharkskin.

 Sharks and   are not actually all that different. Both are designed to efficiently move through fluid, using the shape of their bodies to generate lift and decrease drag, researchers said. The difference is that sharks have about a 400 million-year head start on the design process, they said. 
 
 The small scales, or denticles found on shark body helps in reducing drag, significantly increased lift, acting as high-powered, low-profile vortex generators.
