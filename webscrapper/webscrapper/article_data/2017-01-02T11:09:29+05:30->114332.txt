TRICHY: Demonetisation and drought have thrown life out of gear for farmers, with many of them committing suicide or dying of cardiac arrest. In the last 24 hours, as many as 10 farmers have lost their lives due to cardiac arrest in Nagapattinam district alone. According to farmers associations, 30 of the 51 delta farmers who had lost their lives due to crop loss were from Nagapattinam. Farmers from this district seem to be the worst affected as the region forms the tail end of the peninsula. The increasing percentage of soil salinity also contributed to crop loss, say experts. 

 Kaliaperumal, 60, from Orkudi village in Kilvelur block died on his two acre land where he had taken up samba cultivation on Friday. He is survived by his wife Arivinkodi and two daughters. R Saroja, 67, wife of Ramakrishnan and a native of   village, also died of a heart attack on Friday evening. She had been cultivating crops on two acres of land.
