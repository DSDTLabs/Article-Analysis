BENGALURU: The   governing council's move to reschedule matches of the 11th edition of the T20 league, following a request by broadcaster Star Sports, has hit a roadblock with a few teams objecting to the move, citing logistics and the likelihood of the ticket sales being affected.

 Since the inception of the tournament in 2008, single match fixtures have 8pm starts, while double-headers are scheduled for 4pm and 8pm respectively.
 
 The proposed change of timing was 5.30pm and 7pm for double-headers and 7pm start on days when there is one match. Although the match timing would clash if the matches were held at 5.30pm and 7 pm on the same day, the argument of the   was that the broadcaster has enough channels to broadcast two matches simultaneously.
 
 Among the teams which have objected to the move are defending champions  . "We have objected to (the move). The people of Mumbai work till 6.30pm-7pm, it's going to be impossible to make it to the game at 7pm. You're impacting a lot of things. We're not for it," team owner   said.
 
 While some teams like the   are expected to back the popular view, others like   are yet to give it a thought.
