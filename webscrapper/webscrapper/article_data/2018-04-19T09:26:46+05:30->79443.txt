GURUGRAM: A police complaint has been filed against an   centre that failed to detect two foetuses in the womb of a woman, and led to the death of a newborn. The complaint has been filed after an inquiry by the state medical negligence board concluded there was laxity in the ultrasound report.

 TOI had reported on January 31 that a pregnant woman from   got two ultrasound tests done at Goyal Ultrasound & Diagnostic Center in Sohna on September 29, 2017 and January 17, 2018. On both occasions, the reports stated: “Single, live, intra-uterine foetus”, whereas the woman, Meena (30) was carrying  . She delivered a baby girl through normal procedure on January 21 at the General Hospital in Sohna. 
 
 Within 10 minutes, she experienced severe pain in her back and abdomen. The doctors then noticed there was another baby in the womb, and a boy was born after 20 minutes. But this delay cost the baby its life, and he died at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital sometime later. The mother, too, suffered from several complications.
 
 The medical negligence board observed that both ultrasound reports had diagnosed “single pregnancy”, and that none of them mentioned twin pregnancy. 
  
  
 
 On March 26, the inquiry report concluded “It’s possible to miss twin pregnancy during the first ultrasound, done at around 16 weeks of pregnancy. However, it should not have been missed in the ultrasound done at around 33 weeks”.
 
 “I lost my son. My wife, too, suffered severe complications. How can they be so careless? They certainly don’t deserve to run a clinic of this sort, if they don’t understand the importance and seriousness of their test reports,” said Hiranand, Meena’s husband.
 
 On Tuesday, Hiranand filed a police complaint at the office of DCP (south), which is also marked to ACP (Sohna), for further investigations. “We have received the complaint and an investigation will be conducted by an ACP-rank officer, before registering a FIR,” said DCP (South) Ashok Bakshi.
