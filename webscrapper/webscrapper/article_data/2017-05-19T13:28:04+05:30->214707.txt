PANAJI: Operation at half of the   leases in the state may come to a halt if leaseholders failed to furnish   guarantee by Friday, as ordered by the   (GSPCB). Member secretary of   Levinson Martins said that the consent to operate under Air and Water Acts would be issued to the mining units only on submission of the bank guarantee.

 The board issued letters to leaseholders, who had applied for renewal of consent to operate, warning them that the renewal would not be done unless the bank guarantee is furnished by Friday.
 
 Martins said that vide a letter dated May 8 the companies had been asked to furnish bank guarantee, but as they failed to do so, they have now been informed that their applications would be rejected if they didn’t adhere to the direction.
 
 The bank guarantee has been sought in case the leaseholder failed to adhere to the specifications asked for. The board will start monitoring the air ambient quality, which if it exceeds the permissible limit, will result in the bank guarantee being forfeited, an official said.
 
 Altogether 88 leases had been renewed, of which 70 had obtained consent to operate. Now, of these, 42 were in operation and 39 had applied for renewal, sources said.
 
 As reported earlier by TOI, 27 mining leases had been asked to furnish bank guarantee.
 
 On April 28, the board had put a stop to mining in  , and refused to permit 12 mines to operate in the area. The move had come after it had issued showcause notices to 13 mining companies on April 27 for causing significant air pollution in the vicinity of the village.
 
 The high court of Bombay at Goa had also said there should be no mining-related traffic on Sonshi’s road till the showcause notices issued by the GSPCB are decided upon.
