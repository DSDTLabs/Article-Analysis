IMPHAL: Away from home for 40 years without a trace,   will begin life anew at his ancestral Khumbong Mamag Leikai residence in Imphal West on Thursday at a refurbished house that his family and neighbours are busy preparing. 

 Gambhir, who left home in 1978, was traced to the streets of Bandra after a YouTube video of him singing an old Hindi song was uploaded by Bollywood fashion designer Firoze Sakir. The video, uploaded on October 17 last year, was seen by Gambhir's family members on Saturday, leading to their reunion.
 
 "Two Manipur police officers who reached Bandra on Tuesday evening to take back my elder brother   finished the office formalities on Wednesday. He will be flown home on Thursday," Khomdram  , younger brother of Gambhir told TOI, on Wednesday. 
 
 Philanthropists from various parts of the state continued to visit the family and extended financial aid to ensure Gambhir (65) embarks on his new life happily with his family members. "With the amount donated by the philanthropists, we are thinking of replacing our thatch roof with corrugated steel sheets sometime later to wear a new look of the house,"   said.
 
 "We have now arranged new rooms at our old house with new amenities for my brother. We have bought new beds, clothes, utensils and other items for him. We want to see him happy all the time," an emotional Kulachandra said.
 
 Khumbong resident Atom Samarendra, who played a key role in tracing Gambhir, said the family members and locals will accord a simple home coming ceremony for Gambhir upon his arrival at the airport as well the local ground.
 
 "It's not just his family, everybody in the locality is happy," said Samarendra, who is also the secretary of  , said.
 
 "As told by Firoze Sakir, a group photo of our family with my brother Gambhir will be taken after his arrival and its copies will be sent to him. He is a kind man and we will never forget his help in reuniting us with our brother," said Kulachandra.
