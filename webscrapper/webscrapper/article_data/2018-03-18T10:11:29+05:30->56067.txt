LUDHIANA: In an initiative by the Ludhiana police, a happiness index   will be conducted among women cops of the commissionerate. The purpose of the survey is to identify any woman cop facing any kind of exploitation and whether they are having proper working environment in the department. 

 For this purpose the Ludhiana police have already approached a city-based psychologist, who is preparing a questionnaire based on different aspects. While answering the questionnaire the women cops will be allowed to keep their identity hidden. 
 
 Commissioner of police R N   said that this survey would be started within a short span of time as the questionnaire is still under preparation, in which around 12 questions will be asked to women cops. The official added that the survey would cover about 450 woman cops in the commissionerate on different ranks, including constables, head constables,   and ADCP. 
 
 Dhoke said that, “It is our prime responsibility to ensure that the women cops are given adequate and proper work environment. In the questionnaire, the woman cops will be asked about the physical as well as mental health. Besides, the department also wants to ensure that they do not face any kind of exploitation.” 
 
 The official said that with this initiative the woman cops would also gain confidence in speaking against a problem or harassment, if any. Besides, the top cop said that the questionnaire would be kept confidential. 
 
 Recently, a controversy was generated when an IG ranked official allegedly stated in a function here that the women cops were facing exploitation in the department. However, later, the top official denied it and stated that no such complaints had been received from anyone. However, taking a note of it the Ludhiana police have now decided to conduct the happiness index survey.
