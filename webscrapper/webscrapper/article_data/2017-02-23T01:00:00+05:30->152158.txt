After a tiring week, this was how they decided to break the monotony of work. They quickly huddled up and zeroed in on a place to let their hair down. And when they turned up at this pub, our photog framed them on his camera.   In all-time favourite combo of white and black, Renata pumped up the fashion quotient of the evening. Whereas, Sanjana sported black on black in style. Ananya wore a loose fitting shirt with black jeans and it screamed comfort. The cheerful gang at the party was the girl trio â€” Padmasri, Srishti and Nishi.    Food, beverages and the ambience, too, were just perfect for them to unwind. The DJ was quite impressive and kept the party mood ticking. After a kickass time at the pub, they headed back home saying they would meet more often to party.
