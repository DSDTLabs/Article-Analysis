We recently spotted Dulquer Salmaan’s wife   sporting a baby bump when she arrived at his cousin Maqbool’s wedding reception.

 And now confirming the pregnancy, a source close to the actor tells us, “Yes, Amal is carrying and is expected to deliver the baby by the end of May or June first week.” That’s definitely good news for all Dulquer and   fans.
 
 Dulquer got married to architect Amal in December 2011. On their fifth anniversary last year, the actor, who was shooting for Comrade in America in the US, shared a sweet post, “How you married a cartoon like me I’ll never know! But thanks baby! Happy Anniversary!! 5 years flew by like 5 blinks! I’m so sorry I’m not home this year. I promise to make it up to you when I get back (sic).”
 
 While we are still waiting for confirmation from the couple, we are sure that Dulquer will be a doting dad like his father.
 
 
 
 Meanwhile, it seems to be a baby boom in Mollywood. We also got to know that two more couples are expecting this year. Nivin Pauly-Rinna Joy, who are parents to Daveedh, and Asif Ali-Zama Masreen, who has a son Adam, are set to welcome their second children. Congrats!
