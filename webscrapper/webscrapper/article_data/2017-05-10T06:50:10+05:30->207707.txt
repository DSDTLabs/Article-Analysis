NAGPUR: Varsha Ban and her husband Virendra were booked on Monday for   their clients who had purchased   ( ) policies from them. The couple, slapped with charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust, had collected policy premium to the tune of Rs72, 430 from complainant Geeta Godbole and others but did not deposited the same. Police feel that there may be many more victims who are yet to come to fore.

 Geeta and other victims had approached Shantinagar police station claiming that the Bans have cheated them. Police said Varsha was enrolled as agent with LIC while her husband Virendra used to collect the premiums. In Lalgunj locality, Varsha and Virendra had created substantial client base since August last year. 
 
 Police said Virendra would initially bring their clients the receipt slips from LIC office after depositing their premiums. The clients, including Geeta, got suspicious of Virendra’s intention as he had stopped bringing the premium payment receipts for the clients. Geeta and others tried to inquire about their premium payment status from LIC office when they came to know that their premiums were not deposited for several months. 
 
 Senior PI Kishor Nagrale of Shantinagar police station said that it has come to fore that the couple had earlier lived in several other places and had been shifting their addresses frequently. “We feel that there could be many more victims of this couple elsewhere in the city. In the investigations, we are contemplating to extract more information about them,” he said.
