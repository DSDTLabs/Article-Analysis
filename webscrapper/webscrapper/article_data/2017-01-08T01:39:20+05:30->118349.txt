NEW DELHI: With an extra layer of   at   Airport in the wake of the   shooting, passengers had to wait for longer periods for check-in on Saturday. This was because of secondary ladder-point checking and stringent frisking, officials said.

 The Central Industrial Security Force, which is responsible for ensuring security at IGI, on Saturday appealed to flyers to arrive at the airport a little early to avoid inconvenience. O P Singh, CISF DG, held a meeting with senior airport officials to discuss evacuation plans on both the air as well the city sides in case of a crisis.
 
 On Friday, a man had opened fire at the baggage carousel of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, killing five people. Following this, CISF took immediate measures to step up security at IGI.
 
 A senior CISF officer told TOI: “Orders have been issued to keep a strict   on any suspicious movement at the airport. Frisking has been made more stringent as a part of which we can ask passengers to remove their jackets or shoes. This may cause a little inconvenience, but safety of passengers is paramount.” He admitted that this could lead to longer wait for passengers during peak hours.
 
 Dog squads and bomb detection teams have been put on standby. “Plainclothes personnel have been deployed and additional checkpoints on the approach road to terminals set up,” the officer added. On his meeting with officials, Singh said: “Evacuation plans have been discussed and we plan to conduct drills with NSG. Airlines have been asked to conduct secondary ladder-point checking just before boarding. We appeal to the passengers to cooperate.”
 
 With Republic Day also approaching, spotters and snipers have been deployed on watch towers and high-rises near the airport. All vehicles entering the airport are being strictly checked.
