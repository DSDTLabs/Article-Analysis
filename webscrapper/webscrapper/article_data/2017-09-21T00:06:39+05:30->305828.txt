 Trichy: As good rain is expected from the upcoming north east monsoon, Collector K Rajamani has urged the first responders for full cooperation in ensuring that not one life is lost to rain. 
 
 Speaking at a training session for over 200 first responders on Tuesday, he urged them to act as bridge between the victims and the administration for effective relief. 
 
 Over 10 low-lying areas have been identified in the district that are likely to be affected if there is heavy rain. This includes parts of Thuraiyur, Manapparai and a few other taluks in the district. 
 
 Volunteers in the form of swimmers and people with service motive have been chosen as first responders to aid the administration in rescuing people in case of any emergency. 
 
 The flood-prone areas are those in close vicinity of tanks and canals. “While these water-bodies are de-silted during different periods, overwhelming rain may result in flooding of nearby settlements.” 
 
 Giving example of Pullambadi in Trichy which recorded 15 cm rain on a single day recently, he said that the first responders would play pivotal role in saving  . 
 
 Asking them to alert the district authorities in case of any eventuality, he said that not a single life should be lost this monsoon. 
 
 “Most of the first responders are either locals or members of Nehru Yuva Kendra,” said disaster management trainer P Mohan. About 60-70 of them are good swimmers who can play a decisive role in saving lives. While the initial hours are crucial for saving lives, Mohan said the first responders were sensitised on their role and urged them to remain alert during the monsoon.
