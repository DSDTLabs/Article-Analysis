ALAPPUZHA: A special investigation team has been set up for probing the alleged bank loan fraud case in Kuttanad. District crime branch   will lead the investigation team, said Alappuzha district police chief S Surendran, on Monday. The investigation team was set up based on the complaint of a man from Kavalam. 

 "The complainant Shaji said that a joint-liability group of farmers under Kuttanad vikasana   had taken Rs 5 lakh loan from Canara Bank in his name and now he has received a revenue recovery notice from the bank. He was not a member of the group, karshaka mithra nel karshka joint liability group," said the police chief. Shaji had not named anybody in his complaint.
 
 The police chief also said that he had received two more complaints in this regard on Monday. "I have handed over the complaints to district crime branch DSP. A detailed investigation is on," he said.
 
 Kuttanad viksana samithi (KVS) executive director Fr Thomas Peelianickal said the KVS was recognized by Nabard (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) as an approved NGO for recommending farmers' groups to banks for availing loans to carry out cultivation on leased lands. "KVS started joint-liability groups of farmers in Kuttanad in 2006 and each group has four to six members. Shaji was a member of karshaka mithra nel karshka joint liability group of KVS in 2013. We had recommended Rs 5 lakh for this group which had six members in 2013. This is all that I know. These six members are liable to pay back the loan," he said.
