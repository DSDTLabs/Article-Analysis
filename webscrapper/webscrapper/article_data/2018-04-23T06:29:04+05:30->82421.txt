BENGALURU: The   during the day and   in the evening have left many Bengalureans perplexed. 

 While Prathap N K, a banker in Hebbal, complains of fever due to the fluctuating temperature, Nandini R of Rajarajeshwari Nagar is faced with an everyday crisis— to put her washed clothes outside to dry or not. “You never know when it rains,” she says. 
 
 The quantity of rainfall (54mm) recorded this season from March 1 to April 18 has been more than double the average normal rainfall (26mm) during the same period. 
 
 But experts say this has had almost no impact on the average temperature. These are scattered spells characteristic of the pre-monsoon period, not always resulting in dip in temperature. “Discontinuation of winds over the past few days has resulted in scattered showers. However, the average temperature for March and April continues to hover over the 34-35 degree celsius mark. The highest temperature recorded this year was 34.8 degrees on April 21 and 22. The pre-monsoon period lasts from March 1 to May 31,” says Ramesh Babu, scientist and director in charge, Indian meteorological department, Bengaluru region.
 
 According to him, unprecedented urbanization coupled with environmental degradation is the reason why it feels hotter than it actually is, though it has been raining at regular intervals.
 
 “Factors like population growth, loss of tree cover, emergence of high-rise buildings that block air flow, effect of radiation and increasing concretisation on the ground are causing instability. While there are sudden showers in March-April and again in October in south-interior Karnataka, they continue even during monsoon in coastal areas,” he added.
