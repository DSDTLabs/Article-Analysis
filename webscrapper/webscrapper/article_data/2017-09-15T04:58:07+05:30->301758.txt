NEW DELHI:   has been arrested but Monu Dariyapur’s family still doesn’t feel safe. Getting them killed won’t be a difficult task for Sonu even while sitting inside a jail, the family believes.

 Battling to live a normal life since her husband was murdered in April despite having police protection, Monu’s wife, Rajrani (35), told TOI that she had not stepped out of home since then and her son often skipped school out of fear. 
 
 “Sonu was my cousin but still he killed my husband. He attacked us in 2006, but we escaped. He targeted us later too. Since nothing could deter him, I still don’t feel that his men won’t attack me and my family,” said Rajrani.
 
 Sonu was against her marriage with Monu and had made finishing her family the purpose of his life, she added. “My husband had left the world of crime after our son’s birth. There was no looking back for him. It is so hard to come to believe that he is no more among us.” 
 
 Rajrani started sending her son to school occasionally after the authorities served an ultimatum. “The time when my son is at school is the most difficult time for me. I keep fearing about him and end up calling his teachers, too,” she said. However, nothing can assure Rajrani and she is now thinking about pulling him out of school. “I now think I will have to stop his education. It is difficult to live with this fear.” 
 
 “My husband was killed in the presence of a PSO. Who can guarantee us that having a PSO confirms security?” Rajrani wondered. “I feel suffocated at home. I don’t know how long I will be able to play hide-and-seek.”
