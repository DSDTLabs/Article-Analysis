VADODARA: The   here turned down the bail pleas of   (VUDA)   accused Chirag Patel and RC Shah on Tuesday. Both, Patel and Shah had sought bail from the court last week. 

 This was the second plea filed by the duo after their first application was rejected by the court in August. The new application was filed after the anti-corruption bureau filed the chargesheet in the case.
 
 The accused had sought the bail from court saying that there is contradiction in ACBâ€™s case. However, the court while deciding on the bail applications mentioned that it cannot observe that there are contradictions in the case as it may affect the trial.
 
 The court said that since the investigating agency has succeeded in establishing the prima facie case, the applicants cannot be granted bail.
 
 The duo have been in jail since their police custody ended on July 26.
