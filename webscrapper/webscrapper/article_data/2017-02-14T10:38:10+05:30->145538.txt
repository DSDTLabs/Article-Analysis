NAGPUR: Several   workers stormed the party office at Nari after they were denied tickets for the   elections and locked the party office. The enraged workers were demanding that tickets should have been given to old party workers and sitting corporators instead of those who had just joined the party.

 On Monday morning, when Team TOI reached the Nari area, it found the BSP office located in Samyak Nagar locked. A poster defaming senior party leader Vilas Garud was found over the gate. There was a severe discontent among the workers this time as the party has denied tickets to many senior workers and even ignored sitting corporators.
 
 Party’s founder president, late Kanshiram, had inaugurated the office in late 1990s. Even the current national President Mayawati, too, has visited this party office in the past. It was once the state headquarter, but after the party shifted its state office to Mumbai, it remained the regional office. 
 
 One of the women party workers who did not wish to be named said, “The tickets were sold for money, while those who work for the party honestly were not given an opportunity.” Even a sitting corporator Murli Meshram made similar allegations after he was denied party ticket. He has now joined   and the new party has fielded his wife Maya, who is contesting from Prabhag number 7. 
 
 Many rebels across political parties are in fray as independents to harm candidates of their parties. BSP was facing a serious rebellion as some with good rapport in North Nagpur have decided to work against the party. Some rebels like Sanjay Jaiswal and her wife Harshala are contesting as independents to divide votes to defeat BSP candidates. 
 
 However, state’s vice-president Krishna Bele said it was an act of some miscreants. “In fact, it is an attempt to malign the party’s image ahead of the civic elections,” he said.
