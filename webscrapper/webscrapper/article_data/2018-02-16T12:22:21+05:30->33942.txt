NAGPUR: Stung by the construction of a beach on the historic   violating rules, the chief minister’s office (CMO) has called a meeting of wildlife, forest, revenue and irrigation department officials on Friday.

 TOI, on January 20, was first to report how rules were bend under political pressure to construct a beach on Navegaon Lake by the irrigation department.
 
 State wildlife board (SBWL) member   said construction of beach and other development activities on the river bed are in blatant violation of Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972.
 
 “The lake and area surrounding it are a part of the notified buffer zone of   (NNTR) and also falls within the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ). Any such development activity requires clearance from SBWL,” Rithe said.
 
 Rithe said even if the land where beach has been constructed is in possession of irrigation department the wildlife and territorial officials can always question the violations the area being part of ESZ.
 
 The CMO seems to have acted on TOI news followed by a written complaint by Rupesh Nimbarte, president,  , a Gondia-based NGO.
 
 During the past few months irrigation department constructed a beach and machans in the lake bed. Entire construction activity is going on under the DPDC funds without any sanctioned plan and scientific basis, which threatens to change ecological character of the biodiversity-rich lake.
 
 The works are also in complete violation of Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010, which were amended in 2017. Both, the old and new rules call for wise use of the wetland and the plan shall include objectives of site management and actions required to maintain its ecological character within the context of sustainable development.
