MYSURU: In the wake of a spike in incidents of   straying into human habitat, the   has decided to carry out a door-to-door awareness campaign in villages contiguous with forests, and the residents are being educated about how to handle these situations.

 This follows reports of leopards being sighted in Bandipalya, Tavarekatte, Gourishankar Nagar and other areas in Mysuru. Moreover, there have also been incidents of the wild cats killing cattle and stray does, triggering panic among the locals, who are knocking on the doors of the forest department to trap leopards and release it to the wild.
 
 Currently, on sighting leopards, the people inform the forest department about the same and ask for the wild cat to be trapped. The leopard is then translocated to another jungle, which is not always a happy ending for the animal, since there is often a lot of fighting between the translocated wild cats and the older animals.
 
 Deputy conservator of forests (wildlife) V   told TOI that incidents of leopards straying into villages and other human habitats had come down after the department implemented a slew of preventive measures.
 
 “We are taking up various measures such as creating more waterholes in the forest, and growing grass, which will help the deer survive and could result in an increase in their population. When there is an increase in the population of deer, which are prey for leopards, they will stop entering human habitat,”   said.
 
 On the awareness initiative the department had initiated, the   said that the people would be informed about the precautionary measures they could adopt when they sight leopards, or when there was death of livestock.
