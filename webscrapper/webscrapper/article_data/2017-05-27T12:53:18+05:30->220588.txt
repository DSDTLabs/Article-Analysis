 has always maintained a stoic silence about his getaways, revealing little about his personal vacations on the social media. The 31-year-old  , who's been filming Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati', is currently on a two week break and this time, we have the details. Ranveer, who had to get stitches following a head injury while shooting for 'Padmavati' earlier this week, went for a check-up before taking off to London on Friday around midnight. He plans to catch up on some of the biggest sporting events while there.

  
  
 He'll be watching the   vs Juventus UEFA Champions League final match at the Millenium Stadium on June 3, followed by the India-Pakistan cricket match the next day in Birmingham. The self-confessed sports fanatic has often crossed continents to catch his favourite league games. 
 
 Last February, he had flown out to Canada to catch the NBA All-Star game and live-tweeted through out.
 
  
  
 This time though, the actor hasn't scheduled any shoots in Europe. He wants to completely unwind without any professional commitments. Shopping, binging, indulging his sweet tooth in particular, exploring London by foot and catching up with friends, is what's on the itinerary. There are no plans of   joining either. Nor will he be inconveniencing his 'Bajirao Mastani' director, whom he's working with for the third time. "His absence won't interrupt the shoot of Padmavati as this is a planned break," Ranveer's spokesperson told Mirror.
 
  "Ranveer has been totally focussed and giving his all to the character, Alauddin Khilji. It was Sanjay Leela Bhansali who recommended the rejuvenating trip as the entire crew of Padmavati agreed that Ranveer needed this break."
 
 Deepika, who's playing Rani Padmavati and   as Raja Rawal Ratan Singh will continue to shoot at Film City this month, while Ranveer will resume work once he returns, on June 8. All the three actors still have significant portions to film.
