CHENNAI: All   government employees will receive their salaries on September 28, three days earlier than usual. But the revenue secretary,   collector and Madhavaram tahsildhar will have to wait until they settle the rent arrears of the Madhavaram taluk office, the Madras high court has ruled.

 Justice S Vidyanathan passed the order on a case filed by  , owner of the building housing the taluk office on Red Hills Road, Madhavaram. In December 2009, the pet itioner said she was ap proached by revenue officials seeking the premises for a taluk office and it was mutually agreed that the monthly rent would be `1,20,000.
 
 On December 22, 2009, the tahsildar took possession of the property without signing a proper lease agreement. In February 2011, officials told the petitioner the public works department (PWD) had fixed the monthly rent at `98,925.
 
 As the petitioner protested against the arbitrary fixation of rent, the tahsildhar stopped paying the rent from February 2011, till the court passed an in terim order in October 2012.
 
 Officials claimed the delay in paying rent was due to the petitioner not submitting related documents and also the procedures to be followed for fixing the fair rent.
 
 Taking note of the fact that 67-year-old petitioner had been made to run from pillar to post all these years to get the rental arrears, the judge directed that a lease agreement be entered into between the petitioner and the competent authority within 30 days and the arrears also be paid in the period. Further, it said, “Till such time a lease agreement is signed and the arrears are cleared, all the three respondents shall not draw any salary .“
