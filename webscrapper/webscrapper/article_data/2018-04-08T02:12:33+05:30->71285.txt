GHAZIABAD: The SSP has directed all circle officers and station house offices to remain alert and conduct patrolling in their areas ahead of   on April 14. The step has been taken to avoid a repeat of April 2 incident in which a large number of people from the Dalit community blocked roads and trains to protest a   directive related to the SC/ST Act.

 The cops have also been asked to identify anti-social elements who take advantage of such protests and indulge in vandalism. 
 
 Talking to TOI, SSP Vaibhav Krishna said, “Police officers have been asked to talk to the people who are planning to stage a protest and tell them there is no point going against the law and create a ruckus. If they want to register their protest they can submit a memorandum to us or administrative officials.”
 
 The SSP said that security has been beefed up to deal with untoward incidents. Intelligence agencies will also remain on high alert, even as adequate police force will be deployed at specific locations for peaceful completion of Ambedkar Jayanti celebrations.
 
 Director general of police OP Singh has also asked senior officers to involve civil defence volunteers and village committees for this purpose.
 
 Thousands of protesters had taken to the streets on April 2, venting their anger against the Supreme Court ruling “diluting” some stringent provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The discontent had turned into violence in places like Vijay Nagar, Loni and Modi Nagar in   where they blocked railway tracks, roads and damaged vehicles. 
 
 Altogether 45 people were arrested in the district and sent to judicial custody. As many as 12 separate FIRs were registered in various police stations pertaining to vandalism. A total of 285 persons were named and 5,000 unidentified persons were mentioned as accused in the FIRs.
