A resolution revoking the actor's suspension was adopted at the council's executive meeting on Thursday , the Madras high court was informed on Friday. The council had cited the apologies tendered by the actor before a single judge, and resolved to accept it before restoring his membership.

 The revocation has come a day after the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice M Sundar faulted the suspension order, and gave a day's time for the council to pass appropriate orders. Hinting that the court would step in and pass appropriate orders if the council failed to do so on its own, the bench had orally observed that dissent was a form of freedom of expression and that it should not be responded with suspension.
 
 It all started with Vishal's interview to a Tamil weekly published in August 2016, wherein he had criticised the manner of functioning of the producers council. Taking offence to the interview, the Tamil Film Producers Council suspended Vishal's from membership. Assailing the decision, he moved the high court, where the council told a single judge that they would reconsider the suspension if he apologised for the remarks.
 
 However, when he offered apologies, they refused to accept it, saying the actor had repeated same views in another interview to a television channel. The single judge then dismissed Vishal's plea. He then filed an appeal before a division bench, Vishal's counsel Krishna Ravindran told TOI.On Thursday , the first bench said such comments could not be basis for suspensions.
