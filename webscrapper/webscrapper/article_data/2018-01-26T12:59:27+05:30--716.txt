DEHRADUN:   has registered a drastic fall in paddy procurement from 10,53,645 metric ton ( in 2016-17) to mere 52,431 metric ton till mid-January this year. Haridwar   MP   who was appointed as the member representing Uttarakhand in the chairperson’s consultative committee of Food Corporation of India (FCI) by the Union government a few days ago disclosed this after holding a meeting with FCI officials in Dehradun on Thursday. Attributing the shortfall to "faulty procurement policies", Nishank said that "urgent action was need to improve the situation in the state for which deliberations will be held with all stakeholders shortly." “The drastic fall of over 10 lakh metric ton is a cause of great concern. We will be holding regular meetings with the state government to ensure that paddy procurement increases in Uttarakhand and the state becomes self-reliant in this regard again," said Nishank.
 
  The immediate implication of the shortfall, according to experts, is that the rice supply in ration shops could be hit besides an additional burden being imposed on the state on account of having to procure rice from other states like   and Punjab at a higher cost.
  
  the monthly demand of 22000 metric ton (rice and wheat) and for Kumaon 14,000 metric ton (rice and wheat). Nishank instructed the FCI officials to hold regular meetings to coordinate with the state government to identify the lapses in the procurement. "
