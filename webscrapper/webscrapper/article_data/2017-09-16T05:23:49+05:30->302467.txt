NEW DELHI: Facing a huge need for funds for ongoing urban infrastructure projects, including housing for all and smart cities, the Centre will tap the market for borrowings to raise resources. 

 While addressing the ‘Public Affairs Forum of India’ on challenges and opportunities of rapid urbanisation in the capital on Friday, Union housing and urban affairs minister   said his ministry is seriously thinking of borrowing from the market to incentivise speedy execution of urban infrastructure projects launched in the last two years. This will be the first such move by the ministry to raise funds from the market. Puri said his ministry will set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for this purpose and the process will start soon. 
 
 “To overcome the severe infrastructure deficit accumulated over long years, huge order of investments is required. To meet various contingencies and to ensure fund availability to meet the targets under new urban missions, we are thinking of mobilising resources from the market. We have undertaken an assessment of requirement of funds till 2022 and likely flow of funds,” Puri said. 
 
 Till now, only a few municipalities including the   have raised fund from market through bonds. 
 
 TOI has learnt that the fund raised from market by the ministry will be used to meet the fresh demand. For example, Andhra Pradesh government on Friday assured the ministry to construct over five lakh affordable houses in the next 15 months. So, the Centre has to pay more as assistance to the state than what could have been allocated from budget under normal circumstances. 
 
 “The fund raised by ministry could be used to meet such demand and subsequently government would increase the budgetary allocation,” a source said. Earlier Puri also said that a comprehensive evaluation of implementation and outcomes of   (JNNURM) will be undertaken.
