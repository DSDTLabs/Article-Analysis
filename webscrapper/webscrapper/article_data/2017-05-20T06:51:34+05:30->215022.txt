NAGPUR: Take note of TOI’s report, senior academician Ved Prakash Mishra has written to the chancellor’s office over Nagpur University’s failure in complying with   ( ) norms on  .

 On May 11, TOI highlighted that NU’s PhD cell has still not complied with the UGC’s guidelines on maintaining scholars’ data. Though the cell has a database of PhD scholars, it only matches on three counts of UGC format while new details like Aadhaar number, funding agency, date of completion etc are missing.
 
 In the report, TOI quoted Pro-VC Pramod Yeole as saying that he wasn’t aware of the UGC circular.
 
 In his letter, Mishra pointed out, “The core issue is that ignorance on the said count for any rhyme or reason ends up in prejudice and harm to the learners and not to the administrators. Hence need for a greater degree of onus, responsibility and accountability in larger academic and public interest.”
 
 He also stated that on March 9, the UGC had mandated furnishing of the registered PhD scholars’ data in a prescribed format for the purposes of National Registry. The UGC had warned that if the direction was not complied with within two months, it would publish names of such institutions on its website as defaulter university.
 
 Mishra has written to the secretary to draw the attention of the Chancellor   over the issue. He has also asked Vice Chancellor SP Kane to take action appropriate action.
 
 The UGC circular was first sent to all Vice Chancellor across the country on March 9 followed by a reminder on April 28 and a final reminder on its website on May 16.
 
 The UGC had also attached a format to be followed by the universities. The format included columns for Aadhaar, mode of PhD, registration number, date of registration, likely date of completion, funding agency, etc of the scholars.
 
 On Thursday Kane said he was in a meeting and on Friday when TOI again called him he didn’t answer.
