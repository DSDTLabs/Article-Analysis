NAVI MUMBAI: A comprehensive plan to upgrade the treatment of effluents for   has been rolled out by   at a cost of Rs 53.33 crore. 

 A major chunk of the project cost—Rs 28.33 crore —will be spent for laying a new and better pipeline for transporting effluents to the  . The project expenditure will go up when the party selected quotes the treatment cost for every cubic meter of effluents.
 
 The tender for expansion and upgrading of the CETP from 22.5 MLD to 27.5 MLD will open on Friday. The cost for this part of the project has been pegged at Rs 25 crore. The tender got an extension as only one party had bid. “We will see what to do if only one party bids the second time too,” said an official from MIDC’s Raigad division. The work on the new pipeline work has started in May. The detailed project report has given 24 months for completion of the work.
 
 Meanwhile, MPCB had directed MIDC to take over the non-performing   CETP by invoking section 33A of the Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1974, in March this year. 
 
 A recent pipeline burst has led to toxic effluents polluting the Kasadi river that in turn caused fish deaths and forced residents of Kharghar and Taloja to breathe foul air.
 
 The CETP has been facing flak for some time now with Kharghar residents complaining of foul odour from toxic waste. The plant has been criticised for not treating effluents properly and with the old pipeline beginning to leak villagers had started complaining about ground water and the river getting polluted. The toxic waste killing fishes had started affecting the livelihood of the native population.
