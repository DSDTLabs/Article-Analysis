KOLKATA: The Special Task Force of Kolkata Police on Thursday evening arrested a key accused in the Rifle Factory Ishapore (RFI)  . Ganesh Paswan alias Bhagwanji (34) is the eighth person to be arrested in this case.

 
  
 Aresident of Nalanda in Bihar, Paswan was nabbed from the Barakar-Kulti belt in Bengal. DC (STF) Murlidhar Sharma said he was produced in the Bankshall court, which sent him to police custody for two weeks.
 
 According to police sources, Paswan used to travel to several states — including Bengal — to buy arms. “He had multiple roles. He would travel to Ishapore, carry back the spare parts to Bihar, assemble them and then take the consignments to their final locations. He wasthe Man Friday to main accused Jay Shankar Pandey alias Panditji,” said an officer.
 
 Police sources claimed that just like Maoist linkman Rajesh Kumar, who was arrested a few days ago, Paswan usually travelled to Kolkata and Ishapore to broker deals on Pandey’s instructions. With his in-depth knowledge in weapons, he became the proxy for Pandey in Kolkata. Ganesh was introduced to RFI contractors involved with the group by none other than Pandey himself. “He is the linkman we had been trying to nab for the last one week. We chased him down to Kulti all the way from Nalanda,” said an investigating officer.
 
 So far, 10 people have been arrested since the STF began probing into the matter in September last year. A police team from Kolkata had earlier left for Bihar to trace at least two middlemen associated with the   gang, that was unmasked 10 days ago leading to the spate of arrests. The arrested persons include two officers of RFI.
