NEW DELHI: Be   the next time you park your car in the middle of the road at   to change a tyre. An   was   when doing so on Sunday night, while his colleague is battling for life in a hospital. They were changing a tyre on Ring Road near Adarsh Nagar in north-west Delhi when a truck slammed into them, having failed to notice the small car in the middle of the road.

 Police said on Monday that the truck driver had fled from the spot. When the collision was reported to the cops, they found that the stalled car had its indicator lights on, but the men had neglected to place the triangle warning to alert other drivers. The cops are scanning CCTV footage to identify the hit-and-run vehicle after registering a case of causing death due to negligence
 
 Rahul (22), Akshay (23) and Ranjan (20) were returning from a programme they had organised in Rohini late on Sunday, when the rear tyre of Rahul’s i-10 blew. Police officers revealed that Rahul did not move the vehicle to the roadside before beginning to change the tyre with Akshay’s help. Ranjan stood some distance away to divert traffic.
 
 According to Ranjan, a speeding truck coming from towards Majlis Park, rammed into the i-10 and crushed Rahul, who was squatted in the middle of the road before dragging Akshay for a few metres. The truck driver halted his vehicle a few metres away, reversed it and fled from the scene, leaving the two men bleeding on the road. Ranjan informed the police control room.
 
 The youths were taken to hospital, where Rahul was declared dead. Police officers conjecture that since the car did not have its lights on when its tyre was being changed, the truck driver did not notice the men. By the time the driver saw them, it was too late to bring the vehicle to a stop.
 
 Rahul was the son of an Azadpur Mandi market committee member, while Akshay’s father runs a small business in Model Town. Ranjan, a student, is the son of a Delhi Police officer.
