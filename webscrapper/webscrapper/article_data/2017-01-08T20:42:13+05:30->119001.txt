AGRA: After Lucknow and Firozabad, Akhilesh’s supporters created a chaos at 
  ’s office in Agra on Sunday, when they prevented Shivpal Yadav’s loyalists from entering the premises.
 
 When contacted, district president Ram Sahai Yadav said though the party office was locked, as it was a holiday, Shivpal’s supporters tried to enter forcibly. He said since these Shivpal’s supporters had burnt an effigy of Ram Gopal Yadav two days ago, they decided to stop their entry.
  
 He said it was ironical that while Shivpal supporters had been claiming that they were undertaking a signature campaign to “unite the party”, they were burning Ram Gopal’s effigy to purposely provoke them. “We cannot tolerate such acts against our leader and thus we blocked their entry,” he said.
  
 On January 1, Akhilesh’s supporters had removed Shivpal Yadav's nameplate from party office in Lucknow. Two days later, they laid siege to the party’s district office in Firozabad. Akhilesh’s supporters, under the leadership of MLC Dileep Yadav, had forcibly entered the SP office in Firozabad and had torn Shivpal Yadav’s posters from there.
