HYDERABAD: Prince Yakub Habeebuddin  , who claims to be a descendant of the last Mughal emperor,  , has sought to know from the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) whether it follows the Constitution.

 
 Aset of 11questions were sent to the AIMPLB office in New Delhi by Tucy, who lives at Kanchanbagh in Hyderabad, on Friday. However, Tucy has sought to get answers from the board under the   Act though it does not seem to come under its purview. The AIMPLB website does not shown any provision for queries under the RTI Act.
 
 In one of the questions posed to the AIMPLB, he asked if the Board celebrates national festivals like August 15 (Independence day) and January 26 (Republic day).
 
 He also sought to know whether the board issues any fatwas and does it have power to issue them. He also sought to know details of the AIMPLBâ€™s bank accounts details, donors and how the money was being utilised. He has also asked on what basis it has in its name 'All India Muslim'. Tucy wanted to know how many resolutions it had passed, whether they were binding or advisory in nature, and also if any were implemented practically. He also sought to know if there were any woman office-bearers.
 
 "Which country is he from?" asked Dr   Sahiba, member of the executive committee of the board when it was mentioned to her by STOI that Tucy has filed an RTI. When pointed out that he describes himself as the great grandson of the last Mughal ruler Zafar, she claimed to have no knowledge of him. "Whoever he is does not matter. The point is the AIMPLB does not come under the purview of the RTI Act. But if he does want information, the board will only be too willing to give because everything is transparent in its functioning," she added. Of the 251 board members, there were 38 women and she herself heads the women's wing, Asra Zehra added.
