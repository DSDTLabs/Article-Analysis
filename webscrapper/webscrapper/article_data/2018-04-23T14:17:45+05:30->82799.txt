 MOHALI: Almost one and a half months after   Commissioner Sandeep Hans asked the police to register FIRs against owners of stray cattle found loitering on city roads, police are yet to act.
 
 On March 5, Hans ordered registration of FIRs against 149 owners of stray cattle. On April 17, a man died and his wife was injured when their bike collided with stray cattle near the phase 7 traffic lights.
 
 
 In another incident reported on Tuesday, a 40-yearold man was killed and his wife was injured after a stray cow ran into his bike near Chawla Lightpoint, Phase 7, Mohali.
 
 The civic body also sent a reminder to the police for registration of FIRs against dairy owners letting their cattle wander in the city or those disposing of cow dung in the sewerage system. Stray cattle have already become a chronic problem and disposing of cow dung in sewerage pollutes the environment.
 
 On December 5, 166 dairy owners were issued notices under Section 188 of the Punjab Municipal Act. They were warned against letting their cattle loose to graze in the community.
 
 Cattle owners were given 15-day notice to stop the practice. When the MC observed non-compliance, an FIR was recommended, sources said.
 
 During the last MC house meet, mayor Kulwant Singh requested councillors to give up double standards over the stray cattle menace. “ During the house meet, all councillors raise a voice to catch stray cattle. But when a team catches stray cattle, they start making phone calls and force team to let the cattle go. We must leave such double standards and contribute for the betterment of society,” he said.
 
 “We are helpless. We have written to Mohali police many times but no action was takendespite repeated requests. Mohali police have not registered a single FIR. This is very serious issue i do not know why they are not taking any action," said Kulwant Singh, Mayor Mohali.
