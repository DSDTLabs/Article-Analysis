HYDERABAD: It was camaraderie at its best between TRS and   at a public meeting in Jagtial on Tuesday. Municipal administration minister   respectfully addressed local Congress MLA T   Reddy as 'anna' and tried to win his heart with his remark, "Whatever is your criticism, we will take it as a blessing." On his part, Jeevan was pleased when the minister assured that some of his suggestions on the   scheme will be brought to the notice of CM Chandrasekhar Rao. 

 As Rythu Bandhu is set to roll out on May 10, Rama Rao urged Jeevan to participate in every programme in the villages so that it sends the right signal to people that it is a programme taken up in right earnest by the government for the benefit of farmers. "I know Jeevan Reddy anna (brother) spends most of his time in Jagtial and is hardly in Hyderabad. I request him to participate in the cheque distribution programme and we welcome any criticism from him," he said. Jeevan seated beside him, nodded his head in affirmation.
 
 The relationship between the main opposition and the ruling party has not been cordial at all, especially in recent times. 
 
  MP Kalvakuntla Kavitha said she would adopt 4,160 two bedroom flats housing colony for which the foundation stone was laid at Nukkapally, Jagtial. She urged Rama Rao to provide the necessary help to ensure that the construction takes place with all amenities promised. She also demanded that Jagtial fort be developed. Responding positively, Rama Rao said the double bedroom housing project was the biggest outside of Hyderabad and also promised a food processing unit as urged by Kavitha.
