Critically acclaimed filmmaker   said he is open to directing a   movie. 

  
  
 The director, however, said it would be difficult for him to commit to the project given the character's current direction. "A lot of the great superhero titles are done. People have used them up. So now it's characters that aren't as interesting."
 
 "But you never know. I mean, Superman would always be interesting. But they're already deep into reinventing him, so that's not going to happen for a long time," Aronofsky, 48, said. 
 
 The director adds that directing superhero movies poses some very particular challenges, because of the intensity of the comic book fans. "I think with those films you have to be careful because they are about communicating with as big an audience as you possibly can. Audiences who go to see those films expect a certain type of movie."
