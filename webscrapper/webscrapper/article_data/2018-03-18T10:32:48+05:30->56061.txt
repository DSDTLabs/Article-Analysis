LUDHIANA: Civic officials are finding it tough to allocate   connections in areas where they recently laid new water-supply lines under AMRUT scheme as there are so many vacant plots in these areas and   is unable to trace the owners of these plots. 

 The officials want to give connections to each property in these areas early on, so that they donâ€™t dig up roads for providing connections later on. 
 
 Of the 25,000 plots covered under the scheme, connections have already been given to around 17,000 households. Under this project, the department has covered areas falling in 24 wards. The idea is to curb illegal connections and damage to roads by digging up roads later on. 
 
 Officials claimed that they have covered areas without water supply under AMRUT scheme. At present, they are completing the construction of tube wells from where the water would be supplied to these households. MC commissioner   said they had reviewed the works going on under AMRUT scheme and were expected to complete it by the end of this month. 
 
 He said they were trying to locate the owners of vacant plots, so that connections could be given at one time. Construction of overhead reservoirs under this project will also take place as the department is going to float tenders for the purpose. In the second phase, old water supply lines will be replaced with new ones. The survey will take another two months.
