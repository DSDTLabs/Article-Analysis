AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Technological University ( ) is mulling over approaching the   (AICTE) to abolish the semester system in the varsity. Sources in the varsity confirmed that vice-chancellor,  , will shortly write to AICTE making a representation in this regard.

 Officials are of the opinion that the admissions to diploma courses offered in the varsity are grossly delayed primarily due to the semester system. This is because the results of class 10 board exam are usually out by June while, the admissions to GTU’s diploma courses are done in August or September with a delay of two to three months. This leaves much less time for the students to actually learn and appear for the first semester-end exams.
 
 The management authorities of various GTU-affiliated institutes have also represented to the VC to abolish the system. Sheth said, “We will write to the AICTE representing the matter. Our request is to abolish the semester system at least from first year diploma if not through the entire course.”
 
 That apart, the university has also made arrangements to announce results of final semester earlier than the existing gap of 2-3 months after the students take the final exams. A separate schedule is being created by the university officials to facilitate this. The decision has been taken so that students get results within a month of the semester-end exams and can plan further course of action be it placement or further studies in India and abroad. It is after 10 years of GTU’s establishment that the ordinance and statute has been readied for this.
