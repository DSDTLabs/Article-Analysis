VARANASI: After failing to reach its target of 25,000 downloads of  , the   ( ) grabbed another chance to improve its national rankings with the extension of download date to February 28. However, the postponement of date has affected the city rankings with Varanasi slumping from 12th to 19th position despite completion of over 20,000 downloads. 

 Ministry of urban development (MoUD) had rolled out Swachhata app in August 2016 to assist citizens in drawing the attention of their respective urban local bodies to a host of deficiencies in service and get the officials concerned to act on it. 
 
 This app, though rolled out on a national basis, is urban local body specific and is linked with Swachh Survekshan 2017, the results of which are expected to be announced after Assembly polls. 
 
 "The date for app downloads was postponed again by MoUD till February end and our efforts didn't go in vain. We have crossed 20,500 downloads so far and are the only city from UP in top 20. Hopefully, more downloads would improve our rankings besides fetching 75 marks," municipal commissioner Shrihari Pratap Shahi told TOI.
 
 Earlier, January 3 was set as the deadline for downloading the app following which the inspection by survey team of QCI had begun all across the country. Varanasi had managed to cross 13,500 downloads and was the only city from UP to feature in top 20 by securing 12th position. Taking note of the lukewarm response, MoUD had further extended the download date to February 12 giving more time to corporation officials to publicize the app's usage among the general public and garner maximum downloads.
