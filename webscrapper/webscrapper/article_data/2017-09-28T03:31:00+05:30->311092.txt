Panaji: Stakeholders at an awareness programme to commemorate World Suicide Prevention Day, highlighted the need for an action plan to prevent suicides in the state that has an average of 15.8 cases per lakh population compared to the all-India average of 11.2 per lakh population (NCRB 2012 data). 

 The concept of ‘excel or be left behind’ has to go, Dr Peter Castelino, managing director COOJ mental health foundation, said, adding that every child has different talents and skill sets. The stigmatisation associated with suicide must also be done away with so that the problem can be better addressed, he added. 
 
 It is perfectly alright to ask a person directly if he/she is feeling suicidal, Castelino said. Eighty percent of the time a person looking for a way out, will seek help directly or indirectly and one must be alert to these signs, he added.
 
 “Silence surrounding suicide must be broken to give an opportunity to people to speak openly, get their problems addressed and receive timely help,” North Goa collector Nila Mohanan said.
 
 Castelino stressed on the importance of follow-ups and monitoring those who have attempted suicide in the past. 
 
 In keeping with the theme, ‘Take a minute, save a life’, Dr Sushma Kirtani, chairperson, Goa State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said it is the moral responsibility of everyone to take a minute and look out for those struggling with life.
