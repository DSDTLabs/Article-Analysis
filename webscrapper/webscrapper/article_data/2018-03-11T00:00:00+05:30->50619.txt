Recently a Holi bash was organised by a social club in the city. With the theme colours, the venue was decorated with colourful umbrellas, dupattas, pichkaris and flowers. The dress code for the evening was traditional where all were spotted dressed in their trendy traditional best! The evening started off with various games, followed by a live band performance by Parmarth Band who sang some of the peppy Holi songs of the year. The guests were seen dancing to the tunes of the band. Later, everyone played Holi with gulaal and ate Holi special gujiyas.
