JAIPUR: The strike called by the   ambulance employees union continued for the third day on Wednesday with the employees and their firm failing to reach a compromise.

 Meanwhile, patients continued to suffer. Bharatpur’s   had to spend Rs 2,200 on a private taxi to bring his bed-ridden wife to Jaipur’s SMS Hospital.
 
 Employees demanded 10% annual increment of salaries promised to them during the last strike. The employees also complained that they were not being provided with a salary slip to know about PF.
 
 “If anyone demands it, he is immediately handed a transfer notice. These are violations of the labour act,’’ said  , member of the union.
 
 Health minister   said, “We are not liable for the employees but have asked the company to resolve the matter as soon as possible. And if there are any labour law violations by the company, we will take actions against them. We called both the parties to reach a settlement, but still no solution. Government has made some temporary arrangements for the patients.”
