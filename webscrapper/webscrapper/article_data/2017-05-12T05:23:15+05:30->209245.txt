MUMBAI: While most   use only buses to ferry students, several parents TOI spoke to said they opt for smaller vehicles for the   and lower cost.

 “The school charges Rs 15,000 annually for its  . The bus can only drop a child at the gate of our housing complex, which is a good five-minute walk. On the other hand, we pay Rs 600 for a mini-van every month and that too only for the time that the school is on and it drops children right at the doorstep,” said  , a mother of two from Mulund.
 
 School   said their managements only give contracts to bus operators who follow safety norms. “We have our own school buses that ferry students to and fro. They are painted yellow as required. We train our staff regularly to ensure that students’ safety is not compromised. We also have CCTV and GPS on the buses. We encourage all students to use the service,” said Rohan Bhatt, trustee, Children’s Academy.
 
 Principals said many opt for privately run smaller vehicles despite safety warnings. “We have more students on our buses, which means the route is longer. Parents prefer to send students in smaller vehicles so that they get home earlier. The safety measures in these vans are something we cannot vouch for and hence we encourage parents not to use them,” said Father Jude Fernandes, principal, St Mary’s School (SSC), Mazgaon.
