Violence at the rally had rippled across the state, leading to widespread rioting and police action in which 13 persons were killed.

Most of you must also be on fixed pay. I beseech you to join our agitation for justice." Hardik had earlier demanded strict action against police excesses after the August 25 rally at the GMDC ground.
 
 "Our fight is not against any community but against injustice towards the   where a widow's son cannot get admission despite scoring 95% marks. Government has slapped sedition charges against me.

 "But you be ready to fight," Hardik told his supporters.
