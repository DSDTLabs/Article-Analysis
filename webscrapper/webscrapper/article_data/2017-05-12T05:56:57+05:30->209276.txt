 Police said the incident happened on April 14, but a complaint was filed only on Wednesday.
 
 Madhukar’s family has sand-mining business. Police said Umesh had a fight with Mangesh, a dalit, allegedly after the latter refused to help him. “The complainant refused to lend sand to the accused, leading to a fight,” said Raigad police PRO Dharmraj Sonke.

 On Thursday, a complaint was lodged against Mangesh by an aide of Umesh alleging verbal abuse and threat. Police suspect the complaint has been filed as counter to the FIR lodged by him.
