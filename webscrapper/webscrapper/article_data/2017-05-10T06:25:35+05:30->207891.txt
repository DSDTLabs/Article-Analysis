BATHINDA: Defying the   of the   regarding burning of wheat stubble, activists of   BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) and BKU (Krantikari) after the expiry of their ultimatum   on fire in more than 10 villages of Bathinda on Tuesday. They   the wheat stubble at Phool, Mehraj, Chotian, Dhapali, Selbrah, Bhagta, Kotheguru, Jethuke, Giddar, Maur and other villages.

 In the last fortnight, about 1,100 farmers have been booked and fine imposed on them in the district. The activists on May 3 had handed over a memorandum to the deputy commissioners with a demand to take back cases being registered under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC and return the money collected through penalty. They had threatened to start burning wheat stubble if their demand was not met by May 8.
 
 Due to reduced burning of crop residue in Punjab and Haryana till May 3, the air quality in northwest India was better this year as compared to last year. However, with more farmers setting the stubble on fire, quality of air may be affected in the coming days, said a Punjab agriculture department official.
 
 In the last week of April, the state farm department had issued a public notice offering 40%-50% subsidy on various implements to be used to manage crop residue. However, farmers were unable to buy these due to high costs. Even many cooperative agriculture societies were unable to afford these, claimed farmer organisations. “We had given an ultimatum till May 8. When the state government failed to meet our demands, we started burning wheat stubble from Tuesday. It will continue in the days to come,” said BKU (Krantikari) president Surjit Singh Phool.
 
 Bathinda DC Diprava Lakra said the teams would be sent to the places where crop stubble was being burnt and appropriate action would be taken against the violators. A PPCB official said that, “We are keeping an eye on burning of crop stubble and action will be taken as per law.”
