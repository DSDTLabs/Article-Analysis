NEW DELHI: At least four major WTO members — the European Union, Japan, South Korea and   — on Tuesday attacked the US for increasing import duty on steel and aluminium and threatened retaliatory action as Washington’s stance at the multilateral body faced scrutiny. Sources said the   administration’s attempt to stall appointments to the appellate body that hears trade disputes, in a bid to paralyse its functioning was an issue on which most WTO members sought clarity from the US. 

 
 While the Americans had so far refused to engage in discussions at the informal ministerial meeting hosted by the government,  , the newly appointed deputy US trade representative, made his government’s concerns (related to the appellate body) public, with other members suggesting that a proposal may be discussed at the WTO headquarters in Geneva. 
 
 
  
 
 A negotiator said duty hike was the second-most discussed issue at the meeting, but it was clearly the flavour of the season. Responding to a question, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo acknowledged the threat and said he was very concerned as such a move by the US “has very real potential for escalation”. “And, that is something we should avoid and that is what we heard today. Many countries are saying we have a concern with it, there is potential for escalation and we have to proceed very carefully and try to work within the framework of the WTO,” he said. 
 
 The main focus of the discussions in Delhi, the first major engagement since global trade talks collapsed in Buenos Aires in December, was to find a way to get negotiators to get back on the table. While there was an overwhelming support to continue with the Doha Round, which focuses on farm, industrial tariffs and services trade, more than half the members were in favour of expanding the agenda to include talks on putting in place an international regime for investment facilitation and micro, small and medium enterprises.
