 IS-linked Lashkar-eJhanghvi terror group claimed responsibility for the killing. “A special squad of LeJ Riaz Basra Brigade undertook the nobel cause of sending an infidel (Ahmadi) to hell. Saleem was spreading his sect's message in the area and he was wanted by Mujahideen of LeJ,“ Ali Bin Sufian, a spokesman of LeJ Al Alami, said.
 
 The Ahmadis protested against the government's silence over the unabated killing of members of their community . Saleem-ud-din, aspokesman for the community, said Latif 's killing showed the ongoing military offensives, were not being implemented properly .“Latif was killed because of his religious beliefs,“ he said. “Hate mongers had published 1,700 ads against the Ahmadiya community but the government did not take any action,“ Saleem said. Saleem said the community was battling against discriminatory laws and expressed frustration that hate mongers were enjoying support of the government.
