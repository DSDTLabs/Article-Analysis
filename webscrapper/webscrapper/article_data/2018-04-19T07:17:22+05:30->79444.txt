PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday directed the government to conduct a radiological scan of the body of activist Bismarque   and submit the report on Friday.

 Dias’ death was registered as a   in April 2017 on the high court directive. Recently, his family sought a CBI probe into the death. 
 
 Bismarque’s body was found floating in a tributary of the Mandovi. Initial police investigation revealed cause of death as asphyxia due to drowning. But the family suspected foul play and sought police probe.
 
 The demand for CBI investigation came after the crime branch which was investigating the case for nearly a year, filed a closure report stating there is no evidence to show that the death was a murder. The crime branch had concluded that the death was accidental.
 
 Dias’s family and his supporters are not willing to accept that Dias’s death was accident, and he was allegedly done to death as an activist he raised many issues.
 
 There has also been demand that crime branch should conduct lie detector tests on the two boys who were last seen with Dias as they have turned major now.
 
 The committee, constituted to explore the feasibility of another postmortem on the activist’s body, had stated that the corpse is unfit for further autopsy examination, but had also stated that a radiology examination is feasible.
