Navi Mumbai: Organizers of a local   tournament in  , who were to give away   animals as prizes, had a change of heart after activists of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( ) India intervened and counselled them. 

 “Some locals informed us that a sports group in Mahagiri Koliwada area of Thane was to hold an annual cricket tournament on the eve of Holi and give away live animal as prizes to the winning team, runners-up and other participants. We contacted the organizers and explained them that it is ethically and legally wrong to give out such prizes,” said PETA India’s emergency response coordinator, Meet Ashar.
 
 Since goats and chickens were to be reportedly slaughtered and eaten at a victory party, the activists told the organizers that they will face a legal case as such act will be a violation of the  , 2001.
 
 “We told them that Holi celebrates that arrival of spring; the season of joy and hope. But, there is no hope or joy for goats, chickens and other animals that are slaughtered for food. They understood our concern and cancelled their plan to buy live animals and instead gave away cash prizes at the matches,” said Ashar.
 
 One of the organizers, Krishna Devlekar said: “When the activists pointed out that one must show kindness to all creatures, we understood their reasoning and dropped the idea of giving away animals as prizes.” 
 
 Activist Anarjit Chauhan commented: “While here the organizers had a change of heart, many others are still illegally slaughtering and killing animals and birds. A mass awareness programme must be executed to highlight this animal cruelty issue.”
