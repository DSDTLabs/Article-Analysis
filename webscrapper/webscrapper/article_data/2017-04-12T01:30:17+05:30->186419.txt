NEW DELHI: Five people, including a senior   of a government  , were arrested on charges of running a pan-India racket that involved forging of cheques and depositing them into other accounts opened on fake papers. 

 The   was discovered when a south Delhi businessman’s   of Rs 95 lakh was found to be misappropriated. The businessman lodged a complaint at the Hauz Khas police station and said the money was paid to a company in Kurukshetra. 
 
 A team led by ACP Rajender Pathania and SHO Sunjay Sharma was formed to investigate. They found that the money had gone into the account of one Amarjeet Singh, a Malviya Nagar resident. He was questioned, during which he said he knew one Rajeev Gupta, the alleged kingpin of the racket. 
 
 Police said Gupta along with Shanu Thakur and Chirag Chaudhary used to procure cheques from agents. They used to copy the cheques, and change the MICR and IFSC codes printed on them. This was done very cleverly by Chaudhary and another person named  . They would chip away the numbers and superimpose new ones with a special ink that couldn’t be detected by a UV ray machine. A cheque would then be encashed. 
 
 The crooks took out money from 30 bank accounts, many of them belonging to businessmen, of which 17 were with government banks. 
 
 Bank manager Pritam Das from Khanpur was arrested for conniving with the fraudsters. Police suspect other employees of different banks may be involved too. “One of the accused is based in the US, while others are spread all over India. We are trying to track them as well,” said additional DCP (south) Chinmoy Biswal.
