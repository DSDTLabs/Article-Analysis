PUDUCHERRY:   chief minister   came down heavily on lieutenant governor   on Saturday and held her responsible for the delay in the implementation of the   government's popular 'free rice scheme' in the Union territory. 

 "Free rice scheme was the first file signed after this government assumed charge. The scheme was implemented smoothly until the administrator (lt governor) raised unwarranted queries. Now, for the past six months, we could not implement it. The administrator has no authority to interfere with the schemes funded by the government," he said. "We have sent several letters to her requesting to change her approach. But there is no change," he said, pointing out at the backlash she faced after she linked the free rice scheme with the toilets in households.
 
 Claiming that he and his cabinet colleagues managed to get several projects sanctioned for the Union territory, he asked, "What is her contribution to the development of Puducherry? She convenes meetings with the officials and prevents them from performing their duties. I have directed officials that none of the files must be in their possession for more than three days."
