NEW DELHI: The government has cancelled the registration of controversial televangeist Zakir Naik’s   IRF Education Trust under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act ( ), making it ineligible to receive donations from abroad.

 The cancellation order dated March 29, 2017, says the FCRA licence of IRF Education Trust, which runs the   at Mumbai and Chennai, was being scrapped under Section 14 of the Act “in public interest and in the interest of maintaining harmony between religious, social, linguistic and regional groups, caste or communities”.
 
 The order comes months after Zakir Naik’s main NGO, Islamic Research Foundation, was declared an “unlawful association” under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.
 
 The home ministry said that as   was closely linked with IRF with “overlapping activities and functions” and also because both the NGOs were controlled and managed by the same person,  , it was satisfied that acceptance of foreign funds by the IRF Educational Trust “is likely to prejudicially affect integrity and sovereignty of India and is also likely to be detrimental to the public interest and harmony between-...communities”.
 
 Earlier, the home ministry had issued a show-cause notice to the NGO asking why impermanent FCRA registration of IRF Educational Trust should not be cancelled under Section 14 of FCRA. 
 
 However, no reply was received even after lapse of more than 30 days.
