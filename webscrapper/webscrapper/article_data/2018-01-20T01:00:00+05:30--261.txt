MOTIHARI: The Samastipur rail division of East Central Railway (ECR) has selected Raxaul and Samastipur railway stations to install Integrated Security System (ISS) to strengthen the surveillance mechanism and maintain 24X7 security.

 Senior DCM and media in charge of Samastipur rail division Birendra Kumar said, “ISS is a multi-security system for protecting and monitoring the passengers, trains, assets and other properties. In this system, CCTV cameras of high resolution would be installed at station gates, platforms, foot overbridges, yards, and in circulating areas of stations. Besides, metal detectors and scanners would be also installed at entry and exit gates on platforms.”
 
 He said the entire security system will be connected to the control room which will function under the Railway Protection Force (RPF). As soon as any mysterious or unattended object will come within the frame of cameras, a beep sound will emanate from it to alert the security personnel at the station.
 
 This modern high-tech security system will also check entry of anti-social elements with objectionable items like firearms, bombs and other things. Raxaul station on Indo-Nepal border is a sensitive area as several terrorists were arrested here in the past and the area has earned notoriety for narcotics smuggling. It is also on the hit list of terrorist organizations operating in border areas.
 
 The railway board has also given its nod to install ISS at Raxaul which is a gateway to Nepal.
