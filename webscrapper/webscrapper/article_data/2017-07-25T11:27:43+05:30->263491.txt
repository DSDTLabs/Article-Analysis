JAIPUR:   government received a major setback as the Centre forestalled the state’s efforts on borrowing against the repayment of loan amount under   (UDAY). The move will reduce the state’s borrowing limit by Rs 4,000 crore.

 Earlier, Rajasthan was allowed to borrow from the market, equivalent of the amount it repays under UDAY. Under this arrangement, Rajasthan was repaying Rs 4,000 crore per year as principal amount and could take loan of same amount from banks.
 
 However, without consensus of states, including Rajasthan, that have opted for UDAY, the Union government stalled this arrangement.
 
 According to officials privy to the development, the decision was unilateral with an aim of keeping the fiscal deficit of the Centre under mandatory 3%.
 
 “It is an irrational step as states will be at the losing end. No such provision was there when UDAY deal was signed. Rajasthan will lose its share of Rs 4,000 crore, which is significant,” said an official.
 
 Each state borrows from the market for development of infrastructure and other projects. However, the borrowing cannot exceed 3% of the state gross domestic product (SGDP). 
 
 At present, Rajasthan has a GDP of Rs 8,27,648 crore and with the limit of 3%, total borrowing cannot go beyond Rs 24,000 crore. With Rs 4,000 crore reduced further, the total borrowing capacity will be restricted to Rs 20,000 crore only. 
 
 This will have an adverse impact on the ongoing projects and those planned during the election year. 
 
 Registering their protest, the   department has written a letter to the Centre, urging them to withdraw the decision.
 
 They are expecting support from other states too that have opted for  .
 
 Moreover, the officials are likely to visit New Delhi and apprise the Centre of the ramifications.
