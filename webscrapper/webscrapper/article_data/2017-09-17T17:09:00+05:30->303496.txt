Nagpur: “Every paediatrician should be well versed with the paediatric advance life support or PALS technology meant for dealing with a critically sick child that involves various management strategies. There is a strong need to have a training module on the subject,” said Dr Prakash Wakode, joint director of Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). He was speaking at the inauguration of a one-day training cum hands on workshop on PALS organized by the department of paediatrics at the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMC). He appreciated the effort of the IGGMC in organizing the programme for the doctors. Dr Dipty Jain, professor and head of the department who was the coordinator for the programme, said the workshop was being organized in the city after 12 years. Now onwards, it will be held as a regular activity for paediatricians. PALS basically involves a specific protocol for the management of critically ill children that may involve handling respiratory and heart related problems. The training is based on modules developed by American Heart Association and American Academy of Paediatrics. The workshop had six teachers, one teacher each for six doctors. These included Dr Somashekhar Nimbalkar, Dr Archana Patel, Dr Meenakshi Girish, Dr Mahesh Patel, Dr Abhay Jain and Dr Milind Kamble. IGGMC dean Dr Anuradha Shrikhande, IAP President Dr Nilofar Mujawar, IAP secretary Dr Rishi Lodaya and IAP executive member Dr Sanjay Deshmukh were also present.
