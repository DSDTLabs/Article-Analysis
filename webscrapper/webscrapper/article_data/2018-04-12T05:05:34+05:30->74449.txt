NEW DELHI: The Centre has defended its revised   before the Delhi high court including the proviso barring disabled people from undertaking the pilgrimage.

 In a reply to a petition seeking quashing of the recently issued guidelines for Haj, the ministry of   said one of the reasons behind the prohibition on allowing disabled people is that some of them “indulge in begging which is strictly prohibited in Saudi Arabia.”
 
 The ministry sought dismissal of the petition and maintained that disabled people are also “vulnerable” to suffering in case of any stampede or mishap during the pilgrimage. It said the move was meant to ensure the “safety and security of lives of pilgrims” and not to deny “whimsically the right of any desirous persons to perform   pilgrimage.”
 
 
 “There is fear of stampede or mishaps. And in such gruelling situation, it is only the pilgrim with physical disabilities who is likely to suffer the most,” the ministry said before a division bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C. Hari Shankar.
