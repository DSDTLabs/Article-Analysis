GURUGRAM: Payments for   Energy Pvt Ltd — the agency appointed for solid   in the city — have been put on hold for the last two months, following a series of   against the agency, MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav said during the House meeting held on Thursday.

 
 According to the commissioner, since the agency has not been able to perform as per the required standards, their payments haven’t been made for March and April. “Continuing the trend, payments will not be made unless they are able to meet the required standards and address the concerns raised by residents,” Yadav said.
 
 While Eco Green takes a user fee from residents for collecting garbage, they are also paid a tipping fee of Rs 1,000 per tonne by the corporation. The commissioner was responding to complaints made by Gurugram mayor   and several councillors that the agency has been a failure as far as waste collection from households is concerned.
 
 TOI had earlier reported that residents of Sector 27 complained that their garbage was not picked up regularly. Such complaints aren’t new; they have been coming from residents across all sectors for the past few months. 
 
 Speaking off the record, many MCG officials also said the number of complaints against Eco Green was increasing by the day. Confirming this, mayor Madhu Azad said, “I have also received several complaints saying that the agency is employing children for waste picking jobs, which is illegal.” 
 
 Eco Green’s troubles do not seem to end as this is not the only controversy they are embroiled in. There are currently three cases going on against the agency in the National Green Tribunal. Residents of five villages are also planning to move court against the proposed waste-to-energy plant which the agency will build in Bandhwari.
