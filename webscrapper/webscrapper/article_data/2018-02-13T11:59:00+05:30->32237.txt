KOHIMA: The newly-formed alliance of   and the Nagaland Democratic Progressive Party ( ) had an early breakthrough as Neiphiu Rio, the saffron party's most trusted ally and a possible chief ministerial candidate, won the Northern Angami-II seat unopposed. 

 Three-time chief minister Rio was declared winner after his rivals - Naga People's Front (NPF) candidate   and Independent candidate Neiphrezo Keditsu - pulled out of the contest on the last day of withdrawal of nominations on Monday, chief electoral officer   said. Last week, BJP had dumped its long-time partner   and joined hands with NDPP, formed in May last year, which Rio joined after parting ways with NPF. NPF secretary   said its candidate Chupfuo, who was pitted against Rio, withdrew his candidature on his own. "He has not consulted the party on his withdrawal," he added.
