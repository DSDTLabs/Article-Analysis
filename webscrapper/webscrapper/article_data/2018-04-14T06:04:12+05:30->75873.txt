BENGALURU:   on Friday reported a 5.3% rise (in dollar terms) in the March quarter net profit and it expects to perform better this fiscal compared to the last. It has projected a growth rate of 6-8% on constant currency basis. The guidance is higher than the 5.8% revenue growth that it achieved in the last fiscal.

 
 The company’s better expectations seem to be coming from the healthy performance seen in Europe, which grew at 3.6% in the last quarter. The US, the main market, barely grew at 0.1%. Chief operating officer U B   said that the US remains a challenge as the big banks continue to spend less on technology upgrades. The insurance segment, and the energy & utility vertical have been doing well for the company.
 
  
  
 
 However, Infosys has projected a lower operating margin for this fiscal at 22-24%. The company had ended last fiscal with a margin well above 24%. It has hitherto been a margin leader in the industry. But several analysts have in recent times advised the company to move away from a high margin strategy to be able to invest in the new digital spaces.
 
 “Our margin guidance reflects our emphasis on digital-led growth. We will focus our investments in underinvested areas of digital, enhance investments in the US and revitalize sales in respect to large deals,” said chief financial officer M D Ranganath.
 
 Infosys has paid 100% of the variable pay to its employees for the fourth quarter, its highest payout in 10 quarters, and announced a new bonus pool from which it will give $10 million as incremental bonus to its 2 lakh employees. But investment bank   said “the markets are likely to view the lower margin guidance band negatively.” And indeed that is what has happened. In early trade in US markets, the Infosys share was trading down nearly 7% on Friday.
