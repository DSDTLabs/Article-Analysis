Indore:   signals at some major squares in the city have not been functioning properly for the past few days. While the signal at Khajrana Square has not been working since last week, the signal at Satya Sai square created problems for commuters.

 As a result, chaos ensued at the square. Commuters complained that with vehicles coming from both sides it was difficult for them to cross the junction.
 
 “With the BRTS corridor in the middle, it creates a blind spot for us while going on the other side. Moreover, we also have to see if there is any bus coming on this route,” said Atul Jain, a commuter.
 
 Pedestrians had to face even more problems. With vehicles coming from all sides, they complained that nobody stopped for them.
 
 “With the traffic signals not working, vehicles do not slow down. There should at least be someone controlling the traffic manually,” a pedestrian complained.
 
 Officials of Atal Indore City Transport Services Limited (AICTSL) said that the problem occurred due to maintenance activities of signals. “Some maintenance was on and the service was back to normal in the evening,” spokesperson of AICTSL Mala Thakur said.
 
 Faults in signals were also reported earlier this month at various squares in the city and ring road. The lapses at Khajrana Square, Rasoma and others are proving to be a serious problem especially during peak hours. Traffic at this crossing on Ring Road is a menace with autos and Magic van drivers who use most of the road as parking lots. Rash bus drivers add to this mess.
 
 Officials with traffic police said that the signals are managed by a private agency and they were looking into the complaints. Experts said that the situation worsens in the evening hours with vehicles getting in the way of each other.
