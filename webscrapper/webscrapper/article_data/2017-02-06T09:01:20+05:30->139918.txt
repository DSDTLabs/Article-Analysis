KARWAR: The death of a large number of tress along the banks of the   in Yellapur taluk in   district has set the alarm bells ringing among the local population, and   officials. While the locals suspect that the trees have been blighted by a disease, the forest department has attributed the spate of tree deaths to unchecked release of industrial effluents into the river.

 Originating in south  , where it is known as Shalmala, Bedthi flows through the   in Uttara Kannada, before joining the   in Ankola taluk. A biodiversity hotspot, the Bedthi valley is home to many rare herbs, trees and fauna. Three consecutive droughts have seen the river reduced to a trickle, making survival hard for the flora and fauna in the region. Botanist and secretary of Karwar’s science centre, Dr VK Nayak expressed shock at the death of trees. “Continuous release of chemicals by factories located on its banks in Hubballi is the cause of these deaths,” he added.
 
 Besides the lack of nourishment owing to drought, the lack of water has also weakened the defence system of the trees, said Nagendra, an arecanut cultivator. “Forest officials appear not be bothered about finding the reason behind the death of these trees. If they act now, further damage can be prevented. Death of trees will only result in proliferation of certain insects, which could destroy our crops,” Nagendra added.
 
 Deputy conservator of forests, Yellapur, Yatish Nayak, however cited other reasons for the death of trees. “Trees on the banks of the river do not generally die. However, chemicals released into the river from the Rayanala Industrial Estate in Hubballi has accumulated at the roots of these trees. These trees have died owing to the lack of water and oxygen,” he added.
 
 However, locals requested the government to look closely into the death of trees in massive numbers on the banks of the Bedthi River.
