After playing the guessing game for months on end,   might have just confirmed that her 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' co-star   will visit India next week. The actress sent out a warm and welcoming tweet to Vin in Hindi and also announced what seemed like the film's probable promotional dates.

  
  
 In her tweet, she wrote, 'Vin, India is frantically waiting for you. We'll meet soon on January 12 and 13. With lots of love.'
 
  
  
 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' which marks Deepika's Hollywood debut, will premiere in India on January 13, a week before it hits screens across the globe. For fans, it will be a double whammy of sorts to see Vin and Deepika promote the film together or even attend the grand premiere together. Vin Diesel has a massive fan following in the country because of the hugely successful 'Fast and Furious' franchise, and of course the 'xXx' franchise. 
 
 While Vin will reprise his role in the DJ Caruso directorial, Deepika will be seen playing the role of a huntress, Serena Unger. The film also stars Donnie Yen, Nina Dobrev, Ruby Rose and Samuel L Jackson.
