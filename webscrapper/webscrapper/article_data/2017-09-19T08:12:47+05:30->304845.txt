LUCKNOW: With instances of people littering and spitting inside   stations showing no signs of abating,   ( ) has decided to frisk all passengers at the entry points of stations from next week to prevent them from carrying   products inside trains.

 LMRC has been forced to take this step as requests to passengers to surrender tobacco products and paan before entering stations has not been complied with. To bring awareness among passengers, the agency will be espousing Centre's Swachh Bharat cause. The frisking order is probably a rare one given by any Metro system in the country to ensure cleanliness inside stations and trains. On September 6 and 7, the first two days af ter the launch, LMRC and the state environment department were shocked to seize about 20kg of tobacco products from passengers at the gates itself.
 
 “In the last 13 days, though people have been sensitised against the usage of tobacco inside stations, be it cigarettes, paan, tobacco sachets, etc, we have spotted passengers carrying them,“ said a Metro official. “We will be deploying women guards to strictly frisk women passengers and check their purses from next week. The male guards have also been asked to be vigilant,“ the official added.
 
 The agency will also be deploying personnel in association with the environment department and putting up standees at the frisking points near the station gates to educate passengers about the ill-effects of tobacco products and them being prohibited items inside Metro premises. The standees will also display the `Swachh Bharat Mission' campaign with a new slogan `Metro hamara, safai ka farz bhi hamara.'
