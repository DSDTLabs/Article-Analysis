 BMRCL managing director   told TOI that the first set of three coaches will roll out on February 14 at BEML.
 
 “BEML will hand over the first three coaches to BMRCL the same day in the presence of Bengaluru development minister  . We will have to integrate the new coaches into an existing train and conduct test runs. The first six-car train will commence operations after clearance from railway safety authorities,” Jain said. “We are expecting these procedures will be completed at the earliest and be ready for commercial operations by March,” he said. BEML sources also confirmed the development and said the coaches are ready to be officially handed over to BMRCL.
 
 As reported by TOI earlier, Namma Metro’s East-West corridor (Purple Line) will get the first Metro train with six coaches, with the first compartment reserved for women. The trial run is expected to take place at night and scheduled to be completed in a month.
 
 BMRCL is also likely to operate six-car trains during peak hours. Last June, the state government and BMRCL promised three additional coaches, with one coach reserved for women for at least one or two trains, by December 2017, but the deadline was missed. Metro ridership recently touched 4.11 lakh, including 2.37 lakh on the Purple Line and 1.72 lakh on the Green Line.
