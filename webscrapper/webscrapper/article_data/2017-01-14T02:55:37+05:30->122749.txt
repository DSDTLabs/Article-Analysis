NEW DELHI: Several infrastructure projects that have been stuck because of falling within 100m of a centrally protected monument may finally take off. Archaeological Survey of India ( ) has proposed an amendment to   Act to “make provisions for allowing   work and projects essential for public in prohibited areas”. 

 The proposed amendment, to be called the Ancient   and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMSAR) Amendment Act 2016, is expected to be passed by Parliament at the earliest. 
 
 When AMSAR (Amendment and Validation) Act was passed in 2010, it imposed a blanket ban on any construction within the 100m radius, affecting several projects in Delhi like KG Marg parking or the PWD tunnel near Sunder Nursery. According to the proposal, “Public work means construction work related to infrastructure that is financed and constructed by the central government for public purpose, being essential to public safety at large and its emergent necessity is based upon specific instance of danger to public safety or security to public at large.” 
 
 It also says that while National Monuments Authority (NMA) will be consulted for permission, the final decision will lie with the central government. If the Centre’s decision differs in substance from the opinion and recommendation of NMA, the government will record its reasons. “Upon decision of the central government determining a construction as public work, no permission shall be required from the competent authority,” the proposal points out. 
 
 The amendment is, however, limited to only public work and makes no mention of any relief to residential properties. Delhi has many protected monuments in densely located residential areas like Green Park, Saket, South Ex and Mehrauli.
