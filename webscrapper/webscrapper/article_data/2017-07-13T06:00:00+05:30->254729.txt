Visakhapatnam: Underfed children are not the only ones who are malnourished. Contrary to perception, children living in urban areas, with more access to junk food combined with reduced outdoor activities, are at a greater risk of malnutrition despite appearing overweight, say doctors and nutritionists. 

 In Tier-II cities like Visakhapatnam, obesity among urban schoolchildren is on the rise due to poor nutrition coupled with lack of physical activity. Such children run the high risk of developing various lifestyle disorders when they grow up, warn doctors.
 
 According to doctors, obesity among schoolchildren has gone up by 25% compared to a decade ago. Chubby, overweight kids are not necessarily healthy, 
 
 Dr Triveni Reddy, consultant in general medicine at Care Hospital, says most children who are found to be suffering from hypothyroidism, Type-I diabetes, kidney problems, lower back-ache, knee pain, polycystic ovarian disease and early menarche, metabolic syndrome, lethargy and fatigue are either overweight or obese. Such obese children are highly susceptible to low immunity and depression as well. They grow up into unhealthy adults, with five-ten times more at risk of developing diseases like diabetes, hypertension, PCOD and cardiac complications.
 
 The main reason for obesity is not genetic but faulty food habits and a gadget-oriented lifestyle. Most schools lack playgrounds and children are burdened with academic stress to the extent that it hardly leaves them any time for outdoor activities. In their free time, the children are more likely to be seen fiddling with smartphones, or playing video games and watching television, observe health experts. Healthy food has been replaced with instant, packaged food and aerated beverages containing preservatives or fatty bakery items, says Dr Reddy.
