SURAT: The majority of medical stores and retail outlets in the city still don’t have swipe (point of sale/PoS) machines for cashless payments. This has halted people’s attempts to buy their regular doses of medication, as operations at banks are yet to normalize to a level that allows customers’ to withdraw the full Rs24,000 per week as allowed by the rules. Surat city has more than 4,500 retail and wholesale outlets that sell medicines, and only 10% so far have got swipe machines. 

 Divyesh Thakkar, the owner of   says, “We, and many other shop owners have applied for swipe machines but our banks have not been able to provide them so far. Banks want Rs 15,000 for fitting the machine, which small retailers cannot afford. Banks say the swipe machines will arrive by Uttarayan, and we have started to accept cheques from customers now.”
 
 There are about 2,600 doctors and 1,600 consultants in Surat city and hardly 5% accept fees through swipe machines, the   (IMA) sources said. 
 
 Dr   said, “I applied to the bank for a swipe machine a month ago, but it is yet to come. I take payments by cheques from patients.” 
 
 Dr   said, “We tell patients that they can pay the fees when they have money with them. Many people come and give the dues, without us having to ask them. However, we now also have a swipe machine.”
 
 Banks say swipe machines are in short supply and it will take at least a year for them to meet the surge in demand. A few banks give swipe machines for free, but only to their preferred clients.
