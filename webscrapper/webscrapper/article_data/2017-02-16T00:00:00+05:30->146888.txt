The   held recently by the students of English Department of St Albertâ€™s College in the city was an insightful event. 

 The expo may have been put up by students of Shakespeare and Chaucer, but it did not restrict itself to just literature. Instead, it showcased varied subjects as rocket science and even the otherworldly, among many others. The expo had details of educational programmes from across the country for the students pursuing bachelors and masters at the college. Novel and refreshing ideas such as a pollution absorption technique kept the onlookers hooked to the programme.
