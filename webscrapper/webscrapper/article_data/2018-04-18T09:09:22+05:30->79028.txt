INDORE: Shortage of currency notes in the system and dry ATM's have refreshed memories of notebandi. Though the situation is not that grim, cash flow has significantly dwindled. 

 Remote branches of nationalized banks and off site ATMs are the worst hit as cash flow has reduced significantly. 
 
 A senior bank official from   said, "We are facing acute shortage of currency notes of almost all denominations. There are more withdrawals from branches and ATMs than deposits."
 
 Bankers said deposit of highest denomination of Rs2,000 currency note is almost negligible since past one month. 
 
 MP Bank Employees Association president   said, "Deposit ratio has gone down significantly. People are hoarding money especially Rs2,000 currency notes. After demonetization, cash flow was anyways less but, sharp drop in deposits worsened the situation."
 
 Another official from a private bank said, "We are not getting cash as required from RBI. Instead, we have been asked to divert daily cash collections to remote branches of SBI as withdrawals are high in rural belts."
 
 Bankers said, withdrawals have gone up in rural branches because of the start of kharif or summer sowing season. 
 
 Nitin Singh Bhati, a senior advocate said, "I wanted cash to pay for the medical bills but, I could not manage cash in any of the ATMs and finally had to go to the   branch to withdraw cash." Though a few private banks denying shortage of cash flow said supply of Rs 2,000 is less but sufficient cash is available to feed ATMs and for branch withdrawals.  , senior manager,   said, "Cash is sufficient in our branches. Except notes of Rs2,000, all other currency denominations are available."
 
  State Bank of India's top management has directed officials through an email that every currency chest branch should contact a minimum of 20 banks in their area and request for cash. Each branch should identify customers, who are willing to deposit cash and to follow better cash management.
