The man behind the critically acclaimed love story  ,  , is back this week to get you on the edge of your seat with   — a story based on a gang war. “Former legendary actor Vishnuvardhan has been known as Dada, but while the title is a tribute to him, the story is purely about a gang war. We are lucky to have   in his first ever   film play the title role which had to have a strong persona about him. After Gombegala Love, I was keen on working on a completely different genre in filmmaking. The idea of a gang war came up over time. The story has been weaved together around this commanding word called ‘Hukkum’ that continues to be used in colloquial terms today,” says Santhosh.
 The visuals are said to have captured the true essence of Bengaluru, what with shooting locations mainly centered in busy areas of the city such as KR Market, Wilson Garden and Magadi Road. “There are five songs composed by Anoop Seelin, all of which have been picturized according to the theme of the story. Add to that an interesting cast and a distributor like Jack Manju backing us, we are all set to entertain our audiences from July 21,” says Santhosh.
