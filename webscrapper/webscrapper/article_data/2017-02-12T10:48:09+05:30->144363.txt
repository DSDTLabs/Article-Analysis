BADAUN:   (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi kicked up a controversy while addressing a public meeting for his party's candidate in Badaun on Saturday. Owaisi, who was quoting a report by Amnesty International, revealed the name of a rape survivor who had later turned hostile in court and also of a rape victim. The women had been allegedly raped after the Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013. 

 Addressing a gathering during his campaign for party candidate Khalid Pervez from Badaun Sadar constituency, Owaisi said, "Amnesty International highlighted the plight of seven gang rape survivors of the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots who had moved to Supreme Court for justice."
 
 Narrating the ordeal of a survivor allegedly raped in front of his four-year-old son, Owaisi revealed her name three times. 
 
 "Her son fainted when she was raped. The report says that the accused pointed a gun at her son and threatened to kill the child if she recognised the attackers in court. Due to the threat, the scared woman turned hostile. One of the other survivors' husband told the media that they didn't receive any help," said Owaisi.
 
 The AIMIM leader also revealed the name of another woman who died following rape. "Chief minister Akhilesh Yadav could not serve justice to these women. He has promised pressure cookers and ghee to women of the state, but what is the use of these things when he can't provide security," Owaisi added.
 
 When Owaisi was later asked why he revealed the names of the rape survivor and the victim, he said, "I was reading from an Amnesty International report. I also said that rape cases have gone up by 200% in UP. I said whatever was written in the report and nobody can deny these facts."
