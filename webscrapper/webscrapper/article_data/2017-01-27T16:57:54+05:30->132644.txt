CHENNAI: “Who is Chinnamma?” This question by deputy leader of the opposition S Duraimurugan became the subject of a debate in the   assembly on Friday. Duraimurugan raised the question when an   member referred party general secretary V K   as  . 

 “Respects to Amma (late chief minister J Jayalalithaa), and respects to Chinnamma (Sasikala) as well,” said Kunnam AIADMK MLA R T Ramachandran as he raised a question to know if a textile park would be set up in his constituency.
 
 Immediately, Duraimurugan stood up and asked who the MLA was referring by the name Chinnamma. This angered the ruling party MLAs. But the   leader stood his ground and wanted to know who the MLA was referring to. 
 
 Speaker P Dhanapal intervened saying every political party had the right to mention their leader's name in the assembly and no one could question it. “Every party elects a leader. MLAs have the right to mention name of their party leader in the assembly and nothing wrong in it. If you want, you can also call names of your leaders and there is nothing wrong in it,” said Dhanapal and refused to listen to Duraimurugan.
 
 Chief minister O Panneerselvam was not present in the house when the issue was raised. He returned soon after the House settled down. 
 
 The speaker’s ruling enthused the ruling party MLAs much to the annoyance of DMK MLAs. Later when senior AIADMK MLA K A Sengottaiyan moved the motion to thank the Governor for his address to the assembly, he mentioned ‘Chinnamma’ at the start itself and criticised Duraimurugan for raising this issue. AIADMK MLAs thumped the desks, and Panneerselvam too joined them in doing so.
