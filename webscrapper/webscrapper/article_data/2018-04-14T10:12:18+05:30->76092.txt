INDORE: It's only the start of summer and several localities of the city have started facing water shortage as borewells in these wards have already dried up. Around 40 per cent of Indore's water supply depends on borewells, which are drying up one after another with depletion in ground water level. 

 The number of calls by residents for water tankers at IMC's control room is gradually increasing. Control room officials said that localities from   to   and   are facing acute water shortage these days. Most of these areas do not have Narmada pipeline facility. Among the most affected areas are Nipania, Kanadia, Natya Mundla, Palda, Limbodi, Kailod Kartal, Chhota Bangarda, Talawali Chanda and Bada Bangarda. These localities have no piped supply and have to depend solely on borewells and tankers. 
 
 The residents of localities that have Narmada supply connection also complained that supply of water has reduced. "Normally we used to get water from Narmada pipeline for one hour a day. Now it has also been reduced to 25-30 minutes a day," said  , a resident of  . 
 
 The water crisis in these localities has exposed the tall claims of IMC to ensure adequate water supply. 
 
 As of now, civic body has deployed 175 water tankers in localities that are facing water crisis. 72 of these water tankers are of IMC while remaining 103 are private tankers. These tankers are being used by civic body on demands of corporators and residents. 
 
 Civic body officials however said that the problems are only in city outskirts. "We have adequate supply of water in city. Some of localities in the outskirts have been exposed to water crisis. We are providing supply through water tankers, and if required rounds of tankers for these areas will also be increased," said  , head of IMC's water works department.
