BENGALURU: If all goes according to plan,   on the Hebbal flyover is likely to be a thing of the past.All thanks to a 1.25km flyover that will come up next to the existing flyover to accommodate vehicles coming from the   (KIA) towards  .

 Tbe Benglauru Development Authority (BDA) has issued work orders for the construction of the Rs 80-crore flyover from Hebbal Lake to Baptist Hospital.
 
 “The orders have been issued and the work will commence very shortly. It is a 15month project and work is proceeding as planned,“ said P N Nayak, BDA engineering member associated with the project. The proposed flyover will run parallel to the existing loop that links Hebbal and Esteem Mall.
 
 Earlier, concerns had been raised about fresh construction near the lake. The National Green Tribunal hadsaid that all construction should take place at a distance of at least 75 metres from the the lakebed, which would serve as a buffer zone.
 
 The BDA now claims that there is no need for land acquisition and the construction will not harm the lakebed as it will be outside the buffer zone. According to official sources, the new flyover will circumvent the buffer zone.
 
 The BDA had already widened the loop linking the heart of the city and Esteem Mall by adding a lane towards the airport. While there were three lanes for airport-bound traffic, there are only two lanes for traffic in the return direction. After the controversial steel flyover project was shelved by the government last year in the face of protests, it considered construction of this new flyover at Hebbal to ease traffic movement towards the airport.
 
 The project site includes a strip of railway land where the Hebbal-Banaswadi railway track passes through.The flyover will come up on either side of the tracks and the BDA will have to obtain a no-objection certificate from the railways to commence the work. Construction work will have to be taken up only when the tracks are not in use.
