AHMEDABAD: The process for   in   XI science stream will begin from Tuesday next week. Schools have been asked to put up a maximum of three merit lists. The first merit list will be declared on June 1.

 For reserved category students, however, forms will be available even later as there will be centralised admission. The district education officer (DEO) will declare the programme for reserved category admissions slated to begin from from June 11.
 
 There are 152 science stream schools in Ahmedabad with over 17,000 seats. Sources in the education department said that, last year, 4,500 seats in science schools had remained vacant. Board officials said that each student will be required to fill up forms separately for different schools.
 
 The DEO has made it clear that each school will have to admit 40 students from its own school and the remaining 20 from other schools. Officials said that minority schools can have six more students in each class, but they will have to be their own students.
