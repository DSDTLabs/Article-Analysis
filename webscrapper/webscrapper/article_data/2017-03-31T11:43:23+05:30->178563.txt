NAGPUR:   of   on Thursday directed the government to circulate the minutes of meeings of panel on conservation of   among all petitioners and respondents to the case.

 The panel constituted as per the court’s orders submitted to the court minutes of meeting in which members discussed various issues pertaining to the crater like stopping sewage coming from slums and town, completing chain-link fencing and also erecting gates at approaching roads to stop vehicular movement. All stakeholders were told to come up with their opinions on panel’s recommendations during next hearing scheduled after two weeks.
 
 The court was hearing a PIL by lawyer   along with Govind Khekale and Sudhakar Bugdane from Buldhana, through counsel Anand Parchure, claiming that the   was slowly degrading because of pollution and silting.
 
 During last hearing, the court asked government to release Rs2 crore for tourism development at historic crater.
 
 After neglecting it for years, the government, prodded by the high court, finally woke up to the beauty and scientific value of the lake formed by meteorite impact. The state tourism department had announced spending Rs10 crore to clean the crater and rid it of untreated sewage, and shifting the nearby habitation including farmers residing within 500 metres of the crater. The unplanned growth of human habitation on all sides of the crater has resulted in its degradation while untreated sewage also flows into it.
