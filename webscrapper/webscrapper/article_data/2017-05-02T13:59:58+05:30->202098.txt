Malayalam cinema has been having a purple patch, when it unraveled the realistic narratives with a bunch of fresh talent. Jayasuryaâ€™s film   reverberates with a similar view, as it has a bandwagon of new actors in it. 

 The first look of the film, which is a biopic on former football captain of India V P Sathyan, was recently out, and it sure looks like an intense movie. 
 It is touted to have an authentic picture of football scene in our country, and will have around 75 real-life football players in the movie. 
 
 Captain has Anu Sithara in the female lead, among a line-up of actors such as Siddique, Deepak Parambol, Renji Panicker and Nirmal Palazhy.
