Virudhunagar: A 32-year-old police constable, K Kannan Kumar from Chennai, who was being hunted in connection with a murder case, was arrested in Ilandaiulam village in Virudhunagar district.

 One Ayyanar, 25, from W Pudupatti village near Watrap in Srivilliputhur taluk was murdered by Kumar’s friends on January 24. Police said he was murdered allegedly at the behest of Kumar, who too hails from the same village. 
 
 Police said Ayyanar, a distant relative of the accused, created a fake profile on Facebook pretending to be girl and befriended him. While the policeman ‘fell in love’ with Ayyanar (thinking that he was a woman), the latter made use of the situation and milked some money. When the policeman realised that it was his distant relative, he felt ashamed and attempted suicide by consuming poison. 
 
 His brother Vijayakumar, 21, his friends Tansi, 27, and Tamilarasan, 23, who visited him in the hospital, vowed to murder him. The trio went to the victims’ house and invited him for a reconciliatory pact. But, later he was found murdered. Police picked up the trio and conducted investigation. While they confessed to the murder, Kumar went underground. 
 
 A police team rushed to Chennai to nab Kumar, but he escaped and went to Kerala. He returned to his native on Tuesday, but was arrested the same day and produced before a judicial magistrate and lodged in prison on Wednesday. tnn
