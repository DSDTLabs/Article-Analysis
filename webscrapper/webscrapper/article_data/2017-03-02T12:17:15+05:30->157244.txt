SASARAM: A   unfolded at village Konaki under the Baddi police outpost area of Rohtas district when a   sat on a   outside the house of her “boyfriend” on Wednesday, alleging he was refusing to marry her even though she was pregnant.

 “I could not appear at Class X board examination on Wednesday at   as my admit card is with Ghanshyam,” said Arti (name changed), whose father and a married sister also joined the sit-in. 
 
 Ghanshyam and his father reportedly left the village after knowing about the proposed dharna.
 
 “I will not leave the place. If they don’t accept me, I will commit suicide here,” said Arti, whi hails from a neighbouring village. 
 
 Locals came in support of the girl and offered her food. Arti said their affair was known in the area and, at times, people even taunted her. “On Tuesday, I tried to convince Ghanshyam’s father, but instead of accepting me as his daughter-in-law, he left the house today,” she said.
 
 Arti’s father said he was ready to sell off his ancestral property to give dowry to Ghanshyam’s family, if they so wished.
 
  said police tried to persuade the girl to lodge an FIR against the boy, but she refused to do so.
