 On July 10, 2016, the fashion firm had lodged a police complaint that its office had been burgled and around Rs 1.53 lakh had been stolen from its digital locker. The police arrested the accused and recovered around Rs 1.40 lakh from them in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. The money was with the police as seized property.

The firm approached the high court seeking modification of this condition so that they could deposit it in the bank.
