NEW DELHI: In a consumer friendly move, telecom regulator   has taken steps to drive in transparency in the myriad tariff plans offered by  . Trai on Monday unveiled a beta version of a portal that aims to bring tariffs offered by different operators and in different service areas on one platform.

 “To enable consumers see tariffs of different TSPs ( ) and different LSAs ( ) at a single place, a beta version of portal namely www.tariff.trai.gov.in has been released by Trai,” the regulator said in a statement.
 
 Emphasising that it has a mandate to ensure transparency in the sector, Trai said various tariff plans and other tariff instruments are being provided at its website in a downloadable format, for easy access.
 
 At present, telecom operators offer information on various tariffs on their own websites.
 
 Trai said the new platform would not only benefit consumers but also help other stakeholders, who can now carry out a comparative analysis. As a first step, Trai has made tariff data available for Delhi circle, and sought user feedback. “To get initial feedback on the look and feel of this portal from consumers, beta version of tariff data for Delhi LSA is also made available on Trai website. The details on the website are as reported by the TSPs of Delhi LSA,” it added
