In the latest episode of Tu Sooraj Mai Saanjh Piyaji, Kanak's broter   is fuming with anger and he keeps asking Kanak to return with them to Puhkar and that he won't spare Uma Shankar.
 
  Kanak stops him from doing anything and says that it is only a matter of four days and then they would get the papers of the Kanak Mishthan Bhandar back. Vansh doesn't agree initially, but later he agrees to it and says he will not tell anything to Uma but will come and take her away after four days. Vansh asks Kanak if she falls in love with Uma Shankar one day but to this she says it would never happen.
  
  Later, Kanak gives kachoris to Vansh and asks him to give only one piece to Bhabho. They leave from there after that.
  
  Kanak is later seen looking for Shiv in the market when she can't find him anywhere. She goes around looking for him but can't see him. At last she sees him riding a toy truck. Kanak rushes towards him but he falls down. Suman sees him and asks Kanak to relax and says that Uma would apply some medicine on his hurt.
  
  They go home and Masi sa starts asking Kanak where was she when Shiv fell down. Suman says that she wasn't there but Shiv says that Kanak was around. Masi sa asks him not to speak when elders are speaking. Uma says that Masi sa has raised them like her own kids and has taken good care of them all her life and that she should be more careful.
