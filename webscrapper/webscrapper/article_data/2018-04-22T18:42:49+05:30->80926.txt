MUMBAI: In a relief for Lt Col Prasad   the Supreme Court on Friday observed that a challenge to a prior government sanction for prosecution can be argued at the time of framing of charge before trial commences.

 The trial court and Bombay high court had rejected his pleas so far saying such objections to a sanction granted under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act ( ) could be heard during the trial. Purohit had moved the apex court to challenge a December 2017 judgment of the Bombay high court and special trial court that had paved the way for his trial in the 2008 Malegaon blast in which seven had died.
 
 He has challenged the validity of the prosecution sanction for his trial under the UAPA as an accused in the 2008 Malegaon bomb blast case. The apex court bench of Justice RK Agrawal and Justice AM Sapre after hearing his counsel  , observed that the trial court must examine whether Purohit should face trial or not before trial commences. If the ruling before the trial court goes in his favour, the case against him would fade away, as he would not have to face trial then in the blasts case. On December 18, 2017, the HC had refused to quash a government sanction permitting his prosecution in the terror case. On December 27, 2017, a special trial court had dismissed his plea to drop the case against him and while discharging him partially, had retained terror charges against him.
 
 The SC in its order noted that Salve “submitted that the observations made by this Court in the order deciding the bail application shall not be totally brushed aside but shall be considered during framing of charges and the trial.” The SC said, “We order accordingly”.
