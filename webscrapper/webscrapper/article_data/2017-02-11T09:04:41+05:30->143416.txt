GHAZIABAD: A suspected gang of thieves attempted a daring heist at a branch of   in Muradnagar by digging a five-feet long tunnel right up to its strong room. The robbers, however, could not pull off with the heist as the tunnel was accidentally spotted by a tea stall vendor on Friday. 

 Sanju, a tea stall vendor in Kasba Chowki in Muradnagar, told police that he noticed the tunnel in a vacant plot in the morning. “I opened my shop as usual early morning and scaled the boundary wall of a nearby plot adjoining the Oriental Bank of Commerce to throw garbage,” said Sanju. “While returning, a heap of freshly dug up mud caught my attention. The heap was not there earlier. I then took a closer look and found a tunnel. I immediately informed the owner of the plot, Mohar Singh. He asked me to call the police,” said Sanju.
 
 Senior officers including the   soon reached the spot. The police found the tunnel to be five-feet in length and nearly six feet deep. “There was a clear attempt to commit theft in the bank as the tunnel ended just at the strong room wall of the bank,” said Ashish Srivastava, circle officer, Sadar, Ghaziabad. The wall of the bank, however, was not breached.
 
 “We also found tools used to dig the tunnel. Had this not been found today, the robbers would have gained access to the bank’s strong room,” said Srivastava, adding that the robbers could be from a nearby area as they knew the bank building very well. Later a forensic team collected evidence from the spot.
 
 According to the police, the heist was planned in advance as the robbers knew that the bank would remain closed for three days consecutively and that police presence in the area would be thin due to elections. 
 
 A case has been registered against unidentified persons, the circle officer said. The matter is being investigated and police presence in the area has increased, he added.
