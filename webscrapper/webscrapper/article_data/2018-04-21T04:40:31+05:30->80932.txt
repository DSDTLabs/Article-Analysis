MUMBAI: Three months after being given the boot from the   (RWITC) premises, BJR, which runs fine-dining restau- rant, Gallops, struck back on Friday. It moved Bombay high court to challenge a January 2018 arbitral award which had directed BJR to “never enter or remain” on the Gallops restau- rant premises at Mahalaxmi Race Course.

 Meanwhile, RWITC has also moved court for execution of the arbitral award to get back its premises. Its plea is scheduled to be heard on April 23. But Gallops pre-empted the execution application by applying on Friday for a stay on the arbitra- tor’s decree. Its counsel   along with   sought a stay on enforcing the decree as they contended the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to pass such a decision.
 
 RWITC counsel Aditya Shiralkar issued a statement before justice   that the club would not proceed with execution till the next date. The HC posted the matter for hearing on April 25.
 
 The arbitrator, former chief justice of Allahabad high court,   had passed three awards in an arbitration proceeding in a longstanding feud between the Club and Gallops.
 
 The Club had terminated its 2008 “catering contract" with Gallops prompting a legal battle in Bombay high court. An arbitrator was first appointed in 2011. The arbitrator had awarded the club almost Rs 35 crore to be paid by Gallops.
 
 In September 2017, the arbitrator held the termination was valid and directed the restaurant to pay the club at a rate of Rs 6.3 crore per annum “till it removes itself or is evicted.’
