INDORE: Water supply in western areas of city was affected on Thursday after Narmada supply line developed leakage at Navlakha area on Wednesday.

 
  officials said that supply was affected in Chandan Nagar, Ambikapuri and Khatiwala localities. “A leakage developed in 900mm line of Narmada at Navlakha bus stop on BRTS Corridor due to which direct supply was affected in western part of the city,” a senior officer with IMC’s Narmada project,   said.
 
 “We tried to carry out repairs on Wednesday itself, but due to heavy pressure, exact point of leakage could not be detected,” he said. “This led to shortage of water in west part of the city.”
 
 A minor technical fault at Jalood pumping station on Wednesday also added to the problem. The fault was, however, repaired later. Water was supplied to the affected areas through tankers.
 
 On Thursday morning, IMC shutdown the pipeline to locate the leakage point. “The leakage was at bottom side of the pipeline, owing to which we had to cut off water supply for repair work,” officials said.
 
 “If repair work takes more time, then the supply to eastern parts of city will also be affected on Friday,” they said. The localities that are likely to be affected on Friday include Suvidha Nagar, Khajrana, Scheme 54, 74 & 78, Sukhliya, Bajrang Nagar, Nanda Nagar, Sai Kripa and Rajiv Awas.
 
 Thursday’s leakage also led to water shortage at   temple. The temple management had to arrange water through tankers to meet its requirement.
 
 Entry of vehicles between   and Navlakha was restricted on Thursday evening to allow repair work to continue late in the night.
