Margao: At a meeting held by the South Goa district administration and the Konkan Railway Corporation ( ) at the Matanhy Saldanha Administrative Complex, Margao on Friday, it was decided to construct a rail underbridge (RUB) at Seraulim. 

 The meeting chaired by additional collector, Johnson Fernandes, was attended by senior KRC officials, and Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao, among others. 
 
 A joint inspection of the site would now be held on September 27 by KRC, South Goa district administration, land survey department and public works department (PWD), it was informed. 
 
 The project will be constructed on a 50-50 cost-sharing basis between KRC and the state government. Once the RUB is constructed, the level crossing at Seraulim will be closed. 
 
 The earlier proposal for a rail over bridge (ROB) at the site was objected to by locals as that would have necessitated demolition of a couple of structures in the locality. Alemao had held a meeting with the locals recently over the issued and had asked the KRC to come out with a solution that would prevent demolition of structures for the project.
