KUNERU(Vizianagaram): The   from K Singpur in Odisha to Parvathipuram in   appears to be no one’s child. This “loop line” is neglected and officials do not bother to maintain the railway track. It is feared that poor maintenance may have led to the derailment of   train. The track was electrified about a year ago. But power supply has not yet been provided. Only diesel engines are used to haul the trains now. Waltair divisional   said, “Traction sub-station is not yet ready. Recently, two traction sub-stations were opened. But respective state governments have not provided power connection.”
