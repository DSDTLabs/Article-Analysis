ICHHAPURAM (Srikakulam): The state and central governments should provide proper treatment to patients with kidney disorders in   area failing which the   will resort to widespread public agitations, said Jana Sena president and   star  . There have been a high number of cases of people in Uddanam in Srikakulam suffering with kidney disorders. 

 Addressing   in   town on Tuesday, Kalyan said the state government should allot Rs 100 crore from the medical budget of Rs 6,000 crore to treat these patients. "Setting up dialysis centres is not the solution. The source of the disease should be traced first," he said. 
 
  Kalyan also urged the state government to appoint a special committee to probe the prevalence of kidney disorders in the area and added that he would appoint a 5-man committee on behalf of the Jana Sena which would submit a report within 15 days following which he would meet the chief minister and other people's representatives and discuss the issue.
