Chennai: Actor Rajinikanth’s announcement on Sunday of his plans to launch a political party may not be just a whimsical statement to buy peace with lakhs of his fans with growing aspirations. He had been doing a lot of homework and much more, besides consulting select expert groups for orientation of thoughts. His statement to take the political plunge has come as a surprise to many, given his past dithering and reluctance.

 The basic initiative was getting to know Tamil Nadu’s geo-political and agrarian issues by sending out select teams across the state looking for specific data and solutions. A technology team will then get into action and analyse it adopting the data analytics approach, it is learnt.
 
 “A large number of his die-hard fans are well entrenched abroad, especially in the IT industry in the US. While they have done well for themselves, they are fully backing   in his mission to change the system here. A sizeable funding too will come from there,” a person in the know told TOI on a condition of anonymity.
 
 “They are completely prepared. As and when the political party is launched, it will be one of the strongest technology-backed initiative to hit the political theatre in the state, with complete data support for every constituency and segments within. That is the only way the team thinks Rajinikanth could take on the might of the two Dravidian parties. Success or failure comes next,” said the source.
