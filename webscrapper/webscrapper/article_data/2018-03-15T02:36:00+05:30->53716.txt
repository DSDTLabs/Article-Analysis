Visakhapatnam: A   amount of Rs 75 per day is all that the health workers and volunteers are offered by the government for their door-to-door visits to ensure that every toddler is immunised against polio.

 On an average, a pulse polio employee is given about 150-180 households as daily target in the couple of days following last Sunday’s polio immunisation day.
 
 “Except this Rs 75 we do not get anything. We have to travel on our own to the polio booths too. With what vigour are we supposed to perform this duty with such a meagre allowance? The staff number is also being reduced every year,” said Satyanarayana V, a health supervisor with the   who was on pulse polio duty at Isukathota.
 
 According to GVMC officials, 420 polio booths were set up on Sunday — the second round of polio immunisation this year — with four attendants at each booth which means a total of 1,680 people. There would be another 40-50 supervisory staff.
 
 Since regular health workers like ANMs would not be   for the task, the authorities rope in SHG women and nursing students.
 
 “We agree that it is less but the amount is according to government norms. That is why on the first day at the booths, we had arranged breakfast and lunch for all of them,” said Dr A Hemanth, chief medical and health officer, GVMC.
