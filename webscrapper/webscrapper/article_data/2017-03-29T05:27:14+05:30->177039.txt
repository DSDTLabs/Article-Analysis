PUNE: Hinjewadi Industries Association (HIA) has made a fresh appeal for a   in Phase III of the Rajiv Gandhi  . An official letter was recently handed over to police commissioner  . 

 A meeting between the police and representatives of HIA is likely by the end of this week.
 
 Increasing police presence in Phase III of the IT Park has been a consistent demand of the associatio and it gained momentum after the recent spate of crimes here, including the murder of software professional   at her office.
 
 The third phase is spread over 350 hectares and houses almost a dozen IT firms, including Tech Mahindra, Cognizant and Synechron among others. 
 
 Mayank Gupta, head of the security panel of HIA, said, “A police chowkey or a police ‘madad kendra’ is definitely needed in Hinjewadi Phase III. Given the traffic situation here, we fear it will take a lot of time for Hinjewadi police to reach the spot, if anything untoward occurs.”
 
 Elaborating on the urgency, the safety and security consultant of an IT major said, “It is one of the fastest growing areas of the IT Park and has not only multinational companies employing thousands of professionals but also residential societies and schools. Hinjewadi police station is almost eight kilometres away. The roads are deserted in the evening and anybody can fall easy prey to criminals here.”
 
  Shukla had agreed, in principle, to the demand. We can start a mobile police chowkie for Phase III,” she had said.
