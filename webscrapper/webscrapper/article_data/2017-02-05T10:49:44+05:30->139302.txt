JAIPUR: The state BJP will observe February 11 as   which is also the death anniversary of Deendayal Upadhyaya, one of the founders of the Jana Sangh.

 Samarpan Diwas will be organized at all the districts in the state and the party will also use the occasion to collect contribution from workers and well-wishers towards party fund.
 
 BJP president   said the party fund collection on that day will be fully cashless as part of the saffron party initiative to usher in new culture of transparency in political funding. 
 
 He said, “As per the new provision, political parties can accept contribution in the form of cash up to Rs 2,000 but we are not accepting any cash on the Samarpan Diwas as the party thinks it has to lead from the front in the effort towards cleaning up political funding of black money initiated by Prime Minister.”
 
 “We will not collect any contribution by way of cash on that day. All contribution has to be either in the form of cheque or cashless transactions,” said Parnami to TOI. 
 
 “I have given direction to all the district units not to accept any contribution in cash,” said the state president.
 
 When asked whether it will be a one-time affair he said the party will encourage cashless payment mode in future also. It is only the beginning. However all are not convinced with the BJP initiative.
 
 Congress spokesperson   said, “It is nothing but a publicity stunt. The BJP is doing it to divert attention from the failed demonetization.”
 
 She asked how the party workers in rural areas could pay where such cashless payment options are not available.
