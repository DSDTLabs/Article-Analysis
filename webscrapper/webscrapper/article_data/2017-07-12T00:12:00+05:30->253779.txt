Mumbai:   has come down heavily on   Narendra Modi in the wake of the killing of seven   pilgrims in J&K on Monday.

 Pouring ridicule on the PM’s foreign sojourns, Thackeray wondered if US President Donald Trump would come to provide security to Amarnath pilgrims. Thackeray was addressing a meeting of the city’s Ganesha mandals at a suburban auditorium on Tuesday.
 
 Recalling that the late Balasaheb Thackeray had threatened to stop all flights to Haj following terrorists’ threat to Amarnath pilgrims in 1996, Thackeray warned the Modi regime that the Sena still possessed the power to carry out the late Balasaheb’s threat.
 
 “I am not Balasaheb Thackeray, but Shiv Sainiks have the power to do this,” the Sena president remarked. “Where are all the gau-rakshaks at this critical hour? What are they doing? What would they have done if the terrorists had been carrying beef in their bag?” he asked. His statement is a clear indication that the Sena is set to adopt a tough stance on the Amarnath killings, said observers.
 
 Hitting out at the state government for revoking a string of laws on noise pollution on the eve of Ganeshotsav, Thackeray said those who take objection to it tend to keep silent on loudspeakers installed at mosques. tnn
