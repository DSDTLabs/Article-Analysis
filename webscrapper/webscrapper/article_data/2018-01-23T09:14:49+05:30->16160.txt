PUNE : Three members of “Stop the V ritual” — a group created on a social media to oppose the   ritual for   women on the wedding night and caste panchayat activities — were beaten up by the community members for protesting against the tradition in Pimpri late on Sunday night.

 The members of the group, including Prashant  , Saurabh Machale and Prashant Indrekar, suffered injuries in the attack. “We were thrashed with chairs, kicked and punched,” said Indrekar, who lodged a complaint with the Pimpri police.
 
 Senior inspector Shridhar   said an offence of rioting had been registered. “We have arrested two suspects so far and ascertained the identity of five more. We will take action against the suspects involved in the attack,” Jadhav said.
 
  
 Around 40 educated youths from the Kanjarbhat community have joined hands to protest against the unjust practices of their caste panchayat, such as conducting ‘virginity test’ of the bride on the first night after the wedding. They formed a group, ‘Stop the V Ritual’, on a mobile messaging service app.
 
 Indrekar said the brides failing the ‘virginity test’ were punished according to the laws laid down by the caste panchayat. “We taken up the issue to the public through social media. Some community members are against us because of it,” he said.
 
 He said on Sunday he and his family members were invited to a marriage in Pimpri. “When we were leaving, I noticed some people thrashing my friends — Tamchikar and Machale,” he said.
 
 He said when he rushed to the rescue of the duo, the people started beating him up also for going against the community. Indrekar somehow rescued his friends and rushed them to a hospital.
