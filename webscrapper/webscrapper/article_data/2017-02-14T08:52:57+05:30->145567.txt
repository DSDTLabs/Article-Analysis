CHENNAI: The Andhra government has so far supplied the city nearly two monthsâ€™ supply of drinking water from the  . About 1.7 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) has reached Chennai through the 152km long Kandaleru-Poondi canal since last month.

 Thanks to the inflow, the city currently has 1.5 TMC drinking water stored in its four reservoirs. On Monday, Krishna water was flowing into Poondi   at 327 cusecs (9200 litres per second). A public works department (PWD) official at Poondi said that the flow of water is steady and likely to continue.
 
 However Krishna water released at 1000 cusecs (28,316 litres per second) from the Kandaleru reservoir in Andhra took about two weeks to reach Chennai on January 25. About 360 cusecs (10,200 litres per second) of drinking water was released from the Poondi reservoir for supply to city homes on Monday.
 
 As per an interstate agreement made in 1983, Andhra has to supply 8 TMC of Krishna water between July and October, and another 4 TMC between January and April. Only 1 TMC Krishna water was supplied by Andhra last year.
 
 Krishna water was released to Chennai following a request by chief minister O Panneerselvam to his Andhra counterpart N Chandrababu Naidu on January 12. Panneerselvam met Naidu and pointed out the dire need of water in Tamil Nadu, citing the failure of the northeast monsoon which resulted in a 57% rainfall deficit in Chennai.
 
 In a letter to Naidu, Panneerselvam wrote, "I am given to understand that as on Thursday (January 12), the water level at Kandaleru reservoir was 13.5tmcft (thousand million cubic feet). Therefore, AP appears to be in a position to release water for Chennai city,"
