 In wooing the majority Lingayats, Rs 2 crore has been allocated to establish a Basava Study Centre at the   to propagate the teachings of 12th century social reformer  . “Basavanna heralded social equality and introduced parliamentary system for the first time to the world,’’ he said. Separate allocations have been earmarked for schemes and development programmes for Christians (Rs 200 crore), Jains and Sikhs (Rs 80 crore each).
 
 
 To woo Muslims, Rs 10 crore has been earmarked for construction of the   at Darul-u-lum Sabeel Ur Rehaman Rishad, Arabic College, Bengaluru and Rs 15 crore for modernisation and development of infrastructure for madarasas.
 
 Outstanding dues of medium-term loans up to Rs 50,000 availed of by shepherds from co-operative banks till December 2017 for sheep and goat rearing will be waived. This is a boon for 12,205 shepherds (the community to which Siddaramaiah belongs), and Rs 52 crore will be spent for it.
 
 The budget has a provision for loans at zero percent interest rate to fisherwomen to take up fishing. These loans are currently being given by commercial/ rural regional banks up to Rs 50,000 at 2% interest rate.
