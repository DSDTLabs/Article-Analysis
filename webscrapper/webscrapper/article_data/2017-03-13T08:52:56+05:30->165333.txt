Unhappy that the party failed to cash in on the opportunity to form the government, Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane along with group of MLAs is likely to resign from the party, a senior   man said. 

 He said that Rane (Jr) along with three MLAs are in touch with   and are likely to meet top BJP functionaries on Monday. Sources said Rane is planning to contest on Sattari Yuva Morcha party ticket. AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh said that he was not aware of any such move in the party. “Vishwajit Rane was himself part of the process that elected Babu Kavlekar as the new CLP leader,” he told TOI.
