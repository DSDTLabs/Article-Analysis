GURUGRAM: A parent on Wednesday spoke up on the two separate incidents of students threatening rape and propositioning teachers for sex at a private school in the city. His children study in the same school. 

 In one case, a student wrote an offensive mail to a teacher, asking her out for a candlelight date and sex. She is continuing to teach at the school. On why she was not coming forward, the parent said that she feared losing her job and only source of income. 
 
 When the teacher approached the school management, she was told the boy would be counselled. According to the parent, no action was taken against the boy as the accused’s father had threatened to withdraw his children from the school. 
 
 In the second case, a student threatened to rape a teacher and her daughter in an online message. The girl was so traumatised that she has not returned to school but no action was taken against the boy, the parent said, adding that the teacher is now planning to discuss her resignation with the school on Thursday. 
 
 Both the teachers are wary because the boys’ families belong to influential families, the parent added.
