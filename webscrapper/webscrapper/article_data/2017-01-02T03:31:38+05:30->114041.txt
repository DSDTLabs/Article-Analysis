THANE: A district consumer redressal forum has rapped Thane-based tour operator and ordered it to refund the advance payment of Rs 1.18 lakh to a   resident, along with interest of 6% per annum from 2012. 

 The forum president,  , and members   and ND Kadam also directed   to pay the complainant,  , Rs 10,000 towards legal expenses.
 
 Balani told the forum that he had booked a Thailand trip, starting July 3, 2012, for himself and his wife and paid Rs 1.18 lakh. But due to some problem he could not join the tour and promptly informed the operator and obtained the credit note for the same. Balani said the tour operator agreed to accommodate him and his wife in a tour beginning December 4, 2013, but failed to provide him details of the trip till the eleventh hour. When the complainant enquired, he was shocked to learn the tour had been cancelled.
 
 In his complaint, he said the operator had failed to organize the tour despite taking the entire cost in advance hence, he should get refund with interest as well as Rs 1 lakh compensation.
 
 The tour operator failed to defend itself, the forum noted and ordered it to refund Balani Rs 1.18 lakh, along with interest of 6% a year from 2012 before February-end. If it fails to do so, interest will be increased to 9% per annum, warned the forum.
