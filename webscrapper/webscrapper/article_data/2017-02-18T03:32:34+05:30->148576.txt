 "You don't find 18th or 19th century Urdu anymore, but what we are speaking today, Hindustani, is actually Urdu. It has evolved with time, by absorbing words from other languages. Even in Pakistan, Urdu is influenced by Pashto, Sindhi and Punjabi. 
 
 "While Urdu is expanding its reach, I feel the Urdu script is shrinking and losing its place. And we need to support and preserve it now," he said. 
 
 Talking about his love for Urdu, Gulzar noted that it was the only language that was capable of "turning strangers into friends". 
 
 "If a girl says two words in Urdu, you wish you could marry her," he quipped.
