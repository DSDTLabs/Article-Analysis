Designer Nicole   loves the "amazing" power of make-up to transform and enhance.

 "Make-up has power. You can transform yourself into another being, which I think is really amazing. I know women who feel most like themselves when they have a full face of make-up on and that makes them feel strong about themselves," Richie told people.com.
 
 "We as women have every tool that we need in order to feel our strongest. best self. I don't think that makeup has to hide you. I think it can accentuate what you already have," she added.
 
 Richie said she feels most empowered by fashion and her choice of clothes is very much influenced by her mood.
 
 "My fashion choices are extremely emotional. I am somebody who likes a lot of colour around me. It elevates me. I'm very passionate about colour and I know that it has a direct effect on the energy that I have around me.
 
 "And so when I'm putting something on, that definitely changes the way that I feel and the way that I approach the day."
