Vadodara: Former fine arts student Chandra Mohan, who is in jail for allegedly setting ablaze head office of MS University (MSU), filed his bail application in sessions court on Monday. His plea will come up for hearing before the court on Thursday.

 Chandra Mohan’s advocate Chetan Parmar said that the national award winning artist has sought bail on humanitarian grounds. “Though he must have set the head office ablaze, but he did not have intention of harming anyone. He had asked everybody to vacate the room and before he lit the match-stick, he asked vice-chancellor’s personal assistant too to go out of the room,” said Parmar.
 
 Besides that, Chandra Mohan’s plea also states that his family’s economic condition was not good and he was the only earning member, thus on that ground too, the court should grant him bail. He has also mentioned that he does not have any criminal background and is a scholar of national-level.
 
 Chandra Mohan has been in Vadodara Central Jail since February 5 when his police custody ended. The police had nabbed him from the head office of MSU after he had set the waiting room outside vice-chancellor’s chamber on fire. The artist, who had landed in controversy in 2007 after his art works which were made as part of his final year evaluation were objected by some BJP members, had claimed that he was ‘frustrated’ by the delay in declaration of his final year results for which he has been waiting since 11 years.
