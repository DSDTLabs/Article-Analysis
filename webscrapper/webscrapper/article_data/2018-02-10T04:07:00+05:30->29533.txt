Mangaluru: Karnataka is mulling over amending the law to make a state nod mandatory to open petroleum and  , said minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs U T  .

 He said the act related to food and civil supplies department ( ) will be amended so that all petroleum and LPG dealers have to obtain a separate licence from the state government. Khader hinted that “it is a friendly confrontation” with the central government for taking objection to the state government’s Mukhya Mantri Anila Bhagya Yojane.
 
 “We’ll soon draft rules to make a state government nod mandatory for all petrol bunks and LPG dealerships. At present, petroleum dealers and LPG dealers obtain only a trade licence from their respective local administrations. However, we plan to bring all petroleum and LPG dealers under the state government’s control. Such a law is prevalent in Andhra Pradesh. We’ll study that law and make an amendment to our law,” Khader said.
 
 He said it’s a result of the confrontation between state and central governments with regard to the implementation of a scheme to distribute free LPG connections to the poor. “We want to bring petrol bunks and LPG dealers in the state under our control. The central government objected to the manner in which the Mukhya Mantri Anila Bhagya Scheme is being implemented in the state as it has the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. Beneficiaries under the Anila Bhagya get more benefits that they are eligible to get two free LPG refills too,” Khader said.
