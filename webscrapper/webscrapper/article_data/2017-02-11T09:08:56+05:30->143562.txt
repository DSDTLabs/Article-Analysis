BENGALURU: The state government gave its nod to software giant Oracle to set up its biggest facility outside California, USA, in Bengaluru. 

 Minister for large and medium scale industries R V   told TOI on Friday that the   (SHLCC) headed by chief minister Siddaramaiah cleared the Oracle project, which is pegged at an investment of Rs 2,438 crore.
 
 "The Oracle facility is supposed to be the biggest outside California for the company, with an employment-generation capacity of 10,000 people," said Deshpande.
 
 IT-BT minister Priyank Kharge said Oracle is expanding its existing capacity in the city, with the project set to come up on 13 acres of its own land in Kadubeesanahalli, east Bengaluru.
 
 Apart from Oracle, the SHLCC also cleared two projects of Larsen & Toubro which are likely to come up on their old factory land in Bytarayanapura. One is a residential project with an investment of Rs 1,280 crore, and the other an IT park worth Rs 1,149 crore.
 
 L&T, which bagged the controversial steel flyover project between   and Hebbal flyover, shifted its Bytarayanapura factory outside Bengaluru and is using the land for its mixer project. "Both the projects are scheduled to come up on the same factory land," said Kharge. In other major projects cleared by SHLCC were a tourism one by Cornerstone worth Rs 1,330 crore, and a Bluestone project worth Rs 2,051 crore.
