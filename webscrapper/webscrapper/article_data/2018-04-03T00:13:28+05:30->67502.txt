Pune: Ishanya, the commercial real estate arm of Deepak Fertilisers, is undergoing a major reconfiguring exercise to make it more sustainable and ultimately break into profitability. Ishanya has been rebranded as Creaticity from April 1 this year. 

 After the reboot, the mall expects to see a footfall of half-a-million every year, compared to a little over two lakh now. In the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, the realty arm of the Deepak Fertilisers posted a revenue of Rs 12.33 crore against Rs 7.03 crore a year ago. It is still running into operational losses, though the loss has narrowed over the year-ago period. The mall draws its revenue from a mix of rental income, revenue and margin share.
 
 Beginning April, the overwhelmingly furniture mall will realign itself into a space that provides an almost equal mix of home purchase options, and food and beverages (F&B) and entertainment options. “From about 100% home retail, we will be getting into a mode where home options will occupy 50-55% space in the mall and the rest will be F&B and entertainment,” Mahesh M, CEO, Ishanya, said.
 
 He said as a result of this measure, he expects the occupancy to increase to 80% by March 2019 from about 60-62% now. The entire redesign, which has been in the works for the last one year, comes with a capital expenditure of Rs 10 crore.
