NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation is planning to deploy women guards at its municipal schools to ensure there is no case of sexual harassment on the premises. The move comes after the Delhi government directed all schools not to deploy men guards or sanitation workers in their primary wing.

 “Keeping the recent incidents of rape of a minor girl and brutal killing of a school boy, we are working on the proposal to deploy women guards for our schools,” said a senior official.
 
 The civic body has already floated a tender for installation of   cameras in its schools, which will be monitored by the senior officials through a mobile app. “The installation process will start within a month. Also, we have brought a proposal to recruit people who have worked in defence system to head the security of every school,” added the official.
 
 DoE in its ‘check on safety measures’ guidelines had issued a 117-point checklist for ensuring students safety on the school premises and warned that there would be zero tolerance for any violation.
