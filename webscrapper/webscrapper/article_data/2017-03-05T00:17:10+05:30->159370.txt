MUMBAI: What began as an idea to   the   diversity of Mumbai and Thane regions, has quickly turned into a nationwide movement.   is organizing a butterfly survey throughout India on Sunday.

 Naturalists will lead trails to impart education and awareness about the winged wonders and collect data about species diversity. “A survey like this can give us an indication of the status of butterflies in the Indian region. Their status is an indicator of the health of the environment we are living in, as butterflies are very sensitive to changes in environment and climate. They can warn us ahead of major changes in temperature and rainfall patterns,” says Isaac Kehimkar, deputy director of the   (BNHS).
