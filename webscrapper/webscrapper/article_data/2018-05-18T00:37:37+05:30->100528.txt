Actor  , who will be seen hosting and performing at the upcoming award show, said that he is very nervous when he performs in front of a live audience.

  
  
 "I am very nervous when I dance. When we dance for films there is a camera and there are takes but when you dance for a live audience there is just that one take so you have to give your best. There are no cuts," Ranbir said at the the press conference of the award show held in Delhi.
 
 The 35-year-old actor said he likes to keep practising the dance steps. "I want to rehearse more because I want to better myself," he added.
 
 The 19th edition of the award night is returning back to Bangkok, Thailand after a decade. Ranbir said he was extremely excited for the same as it is where he first won for his debut film 'Saawariya'.
 
 The   actor was joined by filmmaker Karan Johar, actor   and Kartik Aaryan. Ranbir praises Shahid and said that the 'Padmaavat' star is impeccable on stage.
 
 Shahid, who will be performing and seen as a host at the three-day gala, which will be in Bangkok, said he was not sure if his wife   and daughter   would join him.
 
 "I'd definitely be there," he said.
