NAGPUR: While granting relief to a woman, the Additional District   directed   ( ) to pay her Rs2.15 lakh to her towards her stolen truck.

 A division bench comprising president Shekhar Muley and member Nitin Gharde asked NCIL to pay the amount along with 9% interest from complaint date (September 18, 2012) for deficiency in service in not settling the claim. The insurance company was also told to pay additional Rs10,000 as compensation towards mental physical agony caused to the complainant and another Rs5,000 towards litigation cost, within a month.
 
 Complainant Dimple Bawa insured her truck (MH-31/CQ-0751) for Rs12 lakh. After it was stolen on April 15, 2009, she registered an FIR on April 21, 2009. Since the truck was purchased on a private loan, Bawa informed NCIL and financier about the incident. However, NCIL failed to settle the claim for a long time. In the meantime, the financier started pressuring her for repayment of loan. Subsequently, Bawa granted a no-objection to the financier for settling the claim directly with the insurer, but with the condition that remaining amount would be remitted to her after deducting the loan.
 
 To her surprise, she received court summons on the case from the financier for cheque bounce. She rushed to NCIL’s head office at Kolkata to know about settlement status, but came to know that her claim was already settled by the financier with the insurer for Rs9.84 lakh.
 
 When she sought an explanation, no one responded, forcing her to knock   doors. She contended that the insurer adopted unethical trade practices and was deficient in providing services.
 
 NCIL contended that once the complainant granted no-objection, her role ended, as she signed on the discharge voucher for full and final settlement.
 
 The judges however, came to the conclusion that voucher submitted by NCIL was not discharge voucher, as it doesn’t bear the complainant’s signature. “It’s in fact an acknowledgement of payment received from the insurer by financier. We’re unable to accept the contention that complainant signed discharge voucher in full and final settlement of the claim.”
 
 They pointed out that the truck was stolen just two months after taking the policy and hence, there shouldn’t have been too much depreciation in value. “We’re therefore, surprised that the truck sale proceeds were only Rs. 9.84 lakh, a difference of Rs. 2.15 lakh. Since no documentary evidence of discharge voucher with complainant’s signature is produced by the opposite party (NCIL), it can’t be accepted that the payment has been made in full and final settlement of claim,” the forum said, while partly allowing the case.
