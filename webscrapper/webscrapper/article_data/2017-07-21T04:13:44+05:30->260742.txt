KOLKATA: Trinamool block president of   (47), who was arrested on Thursday morning on non-bailable charges for preventing a traffic cop from performing his duties and demanding money from another cop, was let go on interim bail in the afternoon. 

 Basu's multiple violations of law started on Tuesday afternoon when his car tried to take a U-turn illegally in front of   at Salt Lake. "He was supposed to take a round-about from the island opposite Gorkha Bhawan, but he took a short-cut. So, a civic volunteer stopped his car," said a Bidhannagar Police officer. Leaving his car in the middle of the road, Basu stepped out and began arguing with the volunteer. Though Basu dropped Trinamool leaders' names, sub-inspector   fined him Rs 100 for traffic violation. Basu then opened Facebook on his mobile, started recording the incident and uploaded the video. This reportedly continued for 20 minutes, causing snarls.
 
 The next afternoon, he reportedly stopped his car in front of ASI Biplab   at Karunamoyee, and allegedly demanded money from him. When Mandal refused, Basu allegedly threatened to upload his video too. He allegedly abused and even hit Mandal.
 
 Two cases were initiated against Basu, charging him with extortion, hurting a public servant, stopping a public servant from discharging duty and criminal intimidation. "All sections can be tried by a judicial magistrate and his custody isn't needed," said Basu's lawyer Soumyajit Raha.
