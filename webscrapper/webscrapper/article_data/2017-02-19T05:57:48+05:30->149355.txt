JAIPUR: A 30-year-old woman was found murdered near a   in   area of the city on Saturday morning. The cops found the   covered in a bed sheet and with injury marks on her head.

 While the police have yet to establish the identity of the woman, the primary investigation suggests she was murdered somewhere else whereas her body was dumped in Muhana.
 
 “Her head was smashed with a heavy object, there are also injuries on her hand which suggests she had struggled with her assailant,” the police official said.
 
 The cops have ruled out the loot as the motive of the crime as the jewellery on the deceased’s body was still intact. “We have registered a case and probing the matter. We are trying to find the family members of the victim, though, no missing complaint was launched in our police station about any woman,” the police official said.
 
 The FSL team collected samples from the bed sheet and cloths of the victim and sent it for the detailed examination, “We are examining the   footage of the area to know about suspects,” said RK Singh, SHO,  .
 
 Singh added that cause of death would be determined only after the post mortem report, “We have kept her body at a mortuary and medical examination would be conducted once we are able to establish her identity. We have spoken to people who live nearby, our informers have provided us some details and we are working on those clues,” he added.
 
 A large number of people had gathered around the spot where the woman’s body was recovered.
