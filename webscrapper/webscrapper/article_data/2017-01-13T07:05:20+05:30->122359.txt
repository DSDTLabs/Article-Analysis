 After registering the case, police filed a chargesheet against the five accused, including Rambha and the court issued summons to her for appearance. As Rambha was residing at Canada with her family, police failed to serve her with the summons a few times earlier. On January 10 this year, police came to know that Rambha was in the city to attend a film shoot. So they served her with the summons at Padmalaya studios to appear before the court.
