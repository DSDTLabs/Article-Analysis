Nagpur: Independent corporator   has accused L&T Limited of damaging sewage and water network while laying optical fibre cables. She has demanded action against the company and officials of the civic body.

 Pande submitted a memorandum to municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal on Friday about improper planning in laying optical fibre cables. “L&T is laying cables for Smart City Solutions Project. I understand the importance of the project. However, improper planning is causing inconvenience and destroying civic infrastructure. L&T damaged sewage line at Chakna Square in Lalganj area in my ward no. 21 a few days ago. Also, drinking water pipeline was damaged in a couple of areas. Now, L&T is laying cables in Shanti Nagar Ghat Square and dug up two deep pits causing congestion on the road,” she said.
 
 Pande added neither NMC nor the company has given any intimation to her before laying cables. “We should know about works being executed in our ward. We find it difficult when to reply when citizens start complaining. We have good idea about areas and roads in our wards. Therefore, we can minimize problems while laying cables,” she said.
 
 Pande also said restoration of pits and trenches by L&T was also not proper. “L&T is not restoring pits and trenches soon after completing works. Quality of restoration, wherever done, is also not proper. Engineers are not visiting the sites to ensure all rules for laying of cables and restoration are followed,” she said.
 
 L&T is laying 1,200km optical fibre cables across the city under Rs520-crore Smart City Solutions Project launched by the state government in association with NMC and police department. The company has to complete the project within one year.
