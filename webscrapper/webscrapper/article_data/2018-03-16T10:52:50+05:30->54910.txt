 The student, who hails from Nennel mandal in Adilabad, sat on the bench and wrote the first language paper. The headmaster said that Shankar lost his father at an early age and his mother was forcedtowork as a labourer. “There was a phase when the student wanted to quit his studies and support his family by doing domestic work. However, we encouragedhim to pursuehisstudies to support his family in a better way,” he said.
 
 Shankar is the only son of his mother and has two sisters, who are married.
 
 Shankar wants to become independent in life and master some special skills after scoring goods marks in SSC exams. “He is brighter in academics than his classmates and has a resilience to learn. He doesn’t want to be dependent on anyone,” Srinivas added.
