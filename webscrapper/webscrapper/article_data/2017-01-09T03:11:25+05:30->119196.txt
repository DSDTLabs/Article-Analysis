NOIDA: Claiming that he had been struggling to report a case of online fraud against an e-commerce portal, a ‘police mitra’ took to Twitter to reach chief minister   and  . 

 The tweet eventually prompted UP police to take note of the matter.
 
 Deepak Kumar, a law intern and a resident of Sector 22, said that he came across an advertisement offering huge discount on LED TV on Facebook. “The website offered huge discount on the purchase of electronic goods. I booked the TV through the website and paid Rs 6,500 online on November 6, 2016. I also received a message from the e-commerce portal receiving the order but the company did not deliver the TV,” he said.
 
 When he tried to contact the company’s customer care on the number given on the website, it was unreachable. The company officials also did not respond to the repeated email requests. 
 
 “Then I reached the Sector 24 police station to register a case against the web portal, but I was told to contact   (CCCI). When I reached the office of CCCI, the concerned officials asked me to first file a case in the police station that would be forwarded to the cyber centre,” he said. Failing to register the complaint, Deepak expressed his anguish on Twitter. Later, an official from Noida police contacted him and registered a complaint.
 
 “As a ‘Police Mitra’, I have been voluntarily helping the Noida Police in managing crime and traffic. If I am facing problems in registering a complaint, I can understand what the common people go through for the same,” Deepak said.
