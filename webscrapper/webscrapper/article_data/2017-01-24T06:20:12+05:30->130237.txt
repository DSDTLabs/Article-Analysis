AHMEDABAD:   late on Sunday night arrested Bharatsinh Kathiya, an absconding accused in the Rs 270 crore   from  .

 Kathiya was on the run for six months and hid at farmhouses in Padiad, Gadhada and Muli.
 
 Kathiya is thought to be a close associate of Kishoresinh Rathod, the prime accused, nabbed from the Chambal ravines on the Rajasthan-MP border earlier this month.
 
 According to ATS officials, Kathiya worked as a driver for Rathod and was actively involved in the ferrying of ephedrine from Mumbai to Ahmedabad. “An offence for celebratory firing from a licensed revolver was also lodged against Kathiya about a year ago at Paldi police station,” said an ATS official.
 
 SP ATS Himanshu Shukla said Kathiya had driven Rathod and another, person Hemang Seth, to Bhayandar Road in Mumbai from where they had brought about 100kg of ephedrine to process it in at the Ahmedabad factory owned by Narendra Kacha.
 
 “After processing about 70kg of ephedrine, it was delivered to drug lord Vicky Goswami’s men at Mohammed Ali Road in Mumbai,” added Shukla.
 
 ATS sources said Kathiya was also the person who hired a truck of his relative’s, to transport another 1,339kg of ephedrine from Avon Lifesciences in Solapur—owned by Manoj Jain—to Kacha’s factory, to process it to make it colourless.
 
 “The consignment was seized by crime branch and Narendra Kacha was arrested in July 2016 and is in judicial custody,” added a senior ATS official. Soon after that, Solapur police raided   and seized 8,350kg of ephedrine, worth over Rs 2,000 crore. “Kathiya was also named as an accused by Solapur police,” said a police source.
