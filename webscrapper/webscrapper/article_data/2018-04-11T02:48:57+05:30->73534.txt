MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday pulled up the state for inaction and held it responsible for drastic   through unabated   around   and in the  .

 A bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla, while dictating a judgment in a PIL against illegal sand mining in  , said that such illegal excavation has put the danger of a possible collapse “five important bridges” in the area, including Vaitarna bridge. Senior counsel Gayatri Singh, who appeared for local cultivators from Jhaw island in Palghar who had filed the PIL against illegal sand mining in Vaitarna, said the unchecked illegal activity had already led to submergence of small islands in the vicinity. “The   is an important connection for railway route between Mumbai and north India,” said Singh.
 
 The HC said degradation was brought on by “departmental lapses” and non-implementation of various existing laws and rules to prevent and penalize wrongdoers. The HC directed the state must implement the exhaustive set of rules issued in a January 2018 government resolution and penalize offenders by confiscating vehicles, vessels, and any other means of transportation of the illegally excavated sand.
 
 The HC directed the state to seriously consider the plea on demolishing landing sites where sand is illegally stored. The HC also set up vigilance committee, led by the Thane district collector, and told it submit a compliance report in June.
 
 According to the petitioner, Vaitarna Creek in Palghar district is being abused by using suction pumps. The petition does not say whether the people who are using the suction pumps and excavating sand are the same people in whose favour permits to excavate sand was given or not. The HC said the “user of suctions pumps to excavate sand at Vaitarna Creek would definitely affect the environment and geographical territory as contended in the PIL”.
