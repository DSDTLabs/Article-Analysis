AHMEDABAD: The   government has plans to make   language compulsory up to class eight from the academic year 2018, in schools affiliated with different boards in the state including Central Board of Secondary Education.

 This was hinted by chief minister   when speaking at a daylong ‘Chintan Shibir’ held in  . With a view to re-establish the importance of mother-tongue, Rupani hinted that from the next academic year Gujarati language could be made compulsory up to Class VIII regardless of whether the school was under CBSE, ICSE or other boards.
 
 Earlier, at a programme in Ahmedabad, Rupani had expressed concerns at the number of children failing in Gujarati and the number of students not choosing Gujarati as a subject.
 
 Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, the state education minister had said, “Considering the CM’s concerns about the future of the Gujarati language, we have formed an expert committee to advise the government on strengthening it. The government is considering making Gujarati a compulsory subject in all boards for all classes.”
 
 On Thursday, the CM again hinted that the subject would be made compulsory from next academic year.
 
 Rupani also emphasized boosting the quality of education at primary and high school levels in the state. He stated that with proper utilization of resources, allocation of funds and human resources the state government is determined to make government school education at par with that received in private schools and SFI.
 
 The chief minister said education is the base for development. Thus, without attaining higher quality in education, development remains deficient. The state government is allocating Rs. 25,000-crore, approximately, every year for education. More than 80 lakh students from poor, deprived, downtrodden and labour class families were availing education in 34,000 government schools, he said.
