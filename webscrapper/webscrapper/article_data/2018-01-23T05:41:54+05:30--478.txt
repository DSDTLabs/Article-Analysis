 “On Saturday, Patel, her son   and his wife Bhoomika went to the plot at 10.30am. They spotted a group of people working to erect a barbed-wire fence. Present at the spot were Kanubhai Patel, Amrish Patel, Paresh Patel and Hasmukh Patel. Kanubhai is a distant cousin of Patel’s,” said an official.
 
 Patel and her family protested and told them to leave the plot. The group retaliated, staked their own claim on the plot and allegedly started abusing them. When Ashish tried to reason with them, Kanu Patel advamced towards him with a crowbar. Patel tried to intervene when Hasmukh Patel handed over a can of kerosene to Kanu, who poured it on her while Paresh held her.
 
 “Kanu allegedly threw a lit matchstick at her and her clothes caught fire. Ashish and Bhoomika rushed and doused Patel with water from a nearby tank. The group left but threatened Ashish saying that if he came to the spot again, he would also be burnt alive like his mother. Patel was taken to a private hospital on SG Road for treatment,” said an official.
 
 I H Gohil, inspector of Bopal police station, said the dispute started about two months ago and relates to a strip of land kept open because it had a well which also provided water to nearby areas. “The accused fled after the incident and a search for them is under way,” he said.
