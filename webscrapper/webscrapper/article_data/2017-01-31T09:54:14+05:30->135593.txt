JAIPUR: For   between   opposite to it on   the   (JDA) has proposed to construct a 24-meter long  . 

 The width of the underpass will be 10-feet. JDA has prepared an initial design and appointed a Pune-based consulting firm to prepare the final detailed project report (DPR). The firm will submit its report within three months. “After a recent site inspection, JDA officials have proposed a design to construct the underpass. The project is estimated to cost Rs 15 crore,” said a senior JDA official.
 
 As per the initial proposal, it is also proposed to construct 22 shops on either side of the underpass. Provision to construct 3-feet footpath in front of every shop will be included in the underpass. 
 
 Once the long-pending underpass is built, patients and their relatives will not have to jostle in traffic and commuting would be risk-free. Recently, the health minister also urged the construction of underpass for the convenience of patients. 
 
 With the rise in the number of accidents on the road, hospital administration had earlier asked for connectivity between the two premises several times. Moreover, the crossing between two buildings also has heavy traffic congestion.
 
 The underpass is expected to connect the trauma centre and underground parking at SMS. The passageway would be designed in such a way that stretchers can pass through easily.
 
 The project was conceptualised three-and-a-half years ago during the Congress government. However, it was delayed as the hospital fell on Jaipur Metro phase-II route. 
 
 The civic body had also proposed to construct a foot over-bridge at the site. However, it was shelved due to technical reasons. “It was realized that it would be tedious to carry patients on stretcher on the foot-bridge,” said an official.
