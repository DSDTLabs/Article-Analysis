HYDERABAD: Khairatabad-Panjagutta road, one of the busiest stretches within core city limits, has turned into a traffic nightmare for commuters. Reasons: Reconstruction of a temple near the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences ( ) premises coupled with piling up of seized cars outside the   police station and infrequent violations by unruly motorists.

 “The temple that was demolished few months ago, has been rebuilt in the middle of the road. It should be moved out to make way for vehicles. Also, authorities must curb the practice of visitors parking vehicles in front of shops outside Nims. That reduces traffic to a crawl,” said a local.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 There is also the problem of commuters unlawfully removing some barricades, along the   stretch, to cut into the other side of the road. “This has further worsened the situation as vehicles suddenly enter the opposite lane through these gaps. I have had suddenly apply breaks, on multiple occasions, top avoid an accident,” said  , an IT professional who regularly uses the road.
