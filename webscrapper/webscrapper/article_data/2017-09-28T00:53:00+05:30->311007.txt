Coimbatore: The dengue death toll in the city this year went up to nine on Tuesday evening after a seven-year-old child died of the infection at the Coimbatore Government Hospital. Another seven-year-old child died of viral haemorrhagic fever two hours later.

 A seven-year-old girl from Erode, Yazhini V, died of the infection on Tuesday at 4.10pm. “She was brought to the government hospital on September 22,” said a senior official of the GH. ‘This is an unfortunate death as the parents brought in the patient at a late stage of the infection,” the official added. 
 
 It is presumed that the parents neglected the infection after the fever subsided. “We think that two days after the fever subsided, the parents ignored the infection. The child would have played and become tired and weak by the fourth or the fifth day,” said the official. “This is a case of secondary dengue. It becomes difficult to treat the patient in that case,” the official added. 
 
 The other case was of a seven-year-old boy from Erode who died of viral haemorrhagic fever. “Bharath was brought to GH on September 24. He died on Tuesday 6.10pm,” said the official. 
 
 At present 30 cases of dengue are being treated at the government hospital. When asked about the availability of blood and platelets, officials said they have enough of both for treatment. “And, with social media, people are trying to obtain blood if it is not available,” said resident medical officer A Soundaravel.
