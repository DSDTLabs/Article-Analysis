 Mumbai:   of India (LIC) has booked profits of Rs 6,100 crore from selling equities during the first quarter. This is 145% more than the Rs 2,489 crore of equity profits generated in the corresponding period of the previous year. Divulging this,   chairman   said that the corporation plans to hike its investment in the equity market during the current fiscal — compared to Rs 43,000 crore in FY16 — and a portion of that would be in initial public offerings (IPOs). In FY16, LIC’s equity investment had shrunk compared to a record Rs 65,000 crore in FY15. “In FY15, we had made large investments in the offer for sale of ONGC and IOC. Otherwise, our equity investment is in the range of Rs 50,000 crore,” said Sharma.
 
 He said that while the corporation was likely to invest in the forthcoming IPO of GIC Re, the investment committee would take a call on other insurance companies.
 
 Sharma confirmed that the corporation has been asked to bring down its stake in companies where it held over 15% stake by the regulator. “We have said that we cannot disclose the timing for these as they are extremely price-sensitive decisions,” said Sharma. He added that LIC had brought down its stake in some public sector banks. On bad loans, Sharma said that non-performing assets of the corporation amounted to Rs 18,000 crore, of which close to Rs 13,000 crore were advances made as part of a consortium along with banks. “We have made 100% provisions for all NPAs,” said Sharma.
