ROHTAK: Expressing dissatisfaction over the action taken by Haryana government regarding quota for Jats in jobs and admissions to educational institutes, the All India   Arakshan Sangrash Samiti (AIJASS) on Thursday held a meeting at its headquarters in Rohtak and announced to call a mahapanchayat on June 2. 

 Addressing the AIJASS working committee members, its president   blamed that the government was dragging its feet over the demands promised to them and they would call a mahapanchayat to take a decision in this regard. He said the mahapanchayat would be attended by community members from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and it would be held at Jassia village in Rohtak district. Jassia was the epicentre of Jat agitation for reservation that led to violence in many parts of Haryana in February 2016. 
 
 The AIJASS members said the state government had not fulfilled all their demands, including release of Jat youths jailed for the 2016 violence, and it seemed to be in no mood to deliver what it had promised. They further said youths who landed in jail in connection with the arson at the house of Haryana finance minister Captain   in Rohtak have also not been released. Some AIJASS members said an MP of the BJP had been issuing threats to the Jat community and the ruling regime had been ignoring him. The members at the meeting threatened that at a mahapanchayat on June 2, they might decide to kickstart a stir again for an indefinite period.
