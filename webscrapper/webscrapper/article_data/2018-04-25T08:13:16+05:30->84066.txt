KOCHI:   are becoming rampant in the city, said officials at the non-revenue water management (NRWM) unit, a special anti-theft squad of   water authority (KWA). Mohammed S,   assistant executive engineer said that from April 2017 to March 2018, around 450 cases about unauthorized connections and water thefts were registered in the city. 

 "We have also imposed fines on those involved in water thefts and have collected around Rs 70 lakh as fine in this regard. Compared to other cities, water theft is high in Kochi due to the presence of a high number of highrises, commercial firms, hospitals, hotels and restaurants. Incidents of drawing water through hose connections from the distribution line and pump attached to the line as well as tampering of water meters or faulty meters all accounts to water theft," said an official with NRWM unit.
 
 According to officials with KWA, water thefts and huge revenue loss caused by unauthorized connections in the city and its outskirts are posing a headache to KWA. "Around 23,035 million litres of water, which is 40% of the total water supply to the corporation areas goes unaccounted every year. While KWA is supplying 62,050 million litres from its Aluva pump house to the city per year, only 39,015 litres of water is getting billed," said a KWA official.
 
 Meanwhile, there have been unconfirmed reports that the functioning of NRWM unit is only in the name for the past few months. But officials at the NRWM unit dismissed the allegation and stated that they have been conducting intensive raids to crack unauthorized connections at construction sites and commercial establishments.
