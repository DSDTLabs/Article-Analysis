RAIPUR: A day after International Women's Day, hundreds of women took part in an agitation in the state capital to press the demand for total liquor prohibition and to protest against the   government decision to take over retail sale of liquor and to run the liquor shops through a state owned corporation. 

 Two separate agitations were organised by  , a wing of the opposition Congress, and women belonging to  , a new regional party floated by former chief minister Ajit Jogi in June.
 
 Mahila   members marched towards the official residence of chief minister   at Civil Lines, while supporters of Jogi proceeded to gherao the Vidhan Sabha, which was in session. Mahila Congress members were arrested from different points, while the police did not allow other women's groups to proceed towards the state legislative assembly.
 
 Led by its women's wing president Vani Rao, women supporting the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh attended a public meeting held near Mandi Gate from where they proceeded towards the Vidhan Sabha. Addressing the protesters, Congress leaders questioned the state government for its decision to sell liquor through its own outlets, while the government of a welfare state is supposed to take care of its people by providing them basic amenities of health and education. 
 
 Speakers of the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh also slammed the BJP government for its new liquor policy and demanded an immediate prohibition in the state.
