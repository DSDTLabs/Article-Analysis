LUDHIANA: Panic gripped Ghawaddi village late on Tuesday evening when the body of a woman,   Kaur (48), was found on the main Ghawaddi road by some passer-by. The Dehlon police have registered a murder case against an unidentified person, following the complaint of Harpal’s son   Singh (26).

  Harmesh Singh, the investigating officer from Dehlon police station, said that around 9pm, the police got an alert that a woman’s body had been found on the main road. The body had a deep cut on the forehead, and it seemed that the victim was attacked with a sharp-edged weapon and murdered somewhere else, while her body was dumped in Ghawaddi. ASI added that Jarnail had alleged that his mother was having a property dispute with her sister-in-law, and with a local   leader. The property dispute case with the local leader is already in the civil court.
 
 The police have not ruled out the involvement of the sister-in-law after finding discrepancy in her statement. The ASI said: “The sister-in-law gave a statement that she had seen Harpal Kaur going out around 11am. However, her son had given a statement that he saw her going out of the house around 6pm. The police have been investigating all angles in the case.” The body has been sent for post-mortem by Dehlon police.
