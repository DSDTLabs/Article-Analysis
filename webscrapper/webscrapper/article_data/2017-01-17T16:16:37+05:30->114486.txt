Aamir Khan's Christmas release 'Dangal,' which also stars Fatima Sana Sheikh, Sanya Malhotra and Sakshi Tanwar in lead roles, is roaring at the box-office and how! While the sports drama has collected over Rs 270 crore at the domestic box-office, it has fetched a staggering Rs 141.60 crore in the overseas market, taking the worldwide collection to a monumental figure of over Rs 411 crore. 

 
 
 'Dangal,' which tells the story of Indian wrestler and coach Mahavir Singh Phogat and how he trained his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari to become world-class wrestlers, has collected $ 8.91 mn from USA-Canada, $ 5.81 mn from UAE-GCC, $ 2.99 mn from UK and $ 2.01 mn from Australia. What's surprising here is that 'Dangal'- a film with a Haryanvi setting ' has struck a chord with the international audience, which is primarily a market for formulaic Bollywood films. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Nitesh Tiwari film has been smashing all records and has attained yet another feat by clocking Rs 22.72 crore on its second Saturday. Salman Khan's 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' held the record till now with the second Saturday figures of Rs 19 crore. 
 
 
 The film is the second biggest hit of the year, currently lagging behind by Salman Khan starrer 'Sultan'.
