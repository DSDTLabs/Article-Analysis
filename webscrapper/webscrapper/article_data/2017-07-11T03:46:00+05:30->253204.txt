Nagpur: A 2.50 minutes video clip has gone viral after being streamed on ‘Facebook Live’ by Pankaj Doifode, one of the victims of the Vena dam tragedy of Sunday, at 6.50pm from the boat minutes before they sank with it. Amol Dodke, one of the survivors of the tragedy, seemed to be the one who was most enjoying in water but still had his wisdom in place as he can be seen and heard in the clip where he cautioned against taking a joyride in the boat under influence of alcohol. The video is likely to have been shot and posted live on the social media to make another friend, referred as ‘Pakya’, who may have opted out of the trip, jealous. The friends, who are no more now, wanted Pakya to feel that he may have missed out a great opportunity to enjoy the ride in the scenic Vena dam.  ‘Don’t drink and drive in water,’ Amol can be heard saying as the group eight friends were revelling during the joyride. A contradicting emotion can be heard in the voice of Amol’s elder brother Roshan, who states that he felt confident only after gulping down some spirited beverage as he had been feeling nervous at a spot where the water may be 40-feet deep. Amol, seeming to be over enthused among the others, also wanted to play cards and kept on repeating in the video about feeling exhilarated.  Paresh Kathode, among the one who died, seemed to have sensed the danger as he was heard cautioning others. In response to the warning, another victim Rahul Jadhav was heard quipping that Kathode seemed to be unnerved as his marriage is scheduled in coming November (this year).
