KOLKATA: A group of robbers looted cash of more than Rs 14 lakh from the Posta office of a Siliguri-based trader after holding his employee at gunpoint on Saturday evening. 

 The incident took place barely 200 metres from the Posta police station. 
 
  
  
 Shyam Sharma, who works under 41-year-old trader  , was also assaulted by the robbers. The cops said three men had barged in to the office and escaped with cash worth Rs 14,48,000 in a 15-minute operation.

Officers said that though they have received CCTV footages, they were yet to fix the identity of the accused. A number of present and former employees have been asked to record their statements with the police.

 According to a source, Devi Lal’s office is located inside a four-storey trading hub on KK Tagore Street that houses 33 other offices. “Around 6pm, three unidentified persons entered the office room situated on the mezzanine floor (between third and second floors) of premises no 54/A, K K Tagore Street. One of them reportedly pulled out a gun from his pocket, pointed it at Shyam and also physically assaulted him, raining blows and kicks on him when he tried to resist.

The detective department had earlier nabbed a fivemember Jharkhand-based robbers’ gang for their alleged involvement in a robbery in Posta last year where they had tied up staff of a firm and looted Rs 8 lakh on June 2.
