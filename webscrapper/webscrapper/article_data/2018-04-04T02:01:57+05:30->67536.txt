NEW DELHI: The Delhi   has decided to conduct   into a batch of   on  .

 At the end of Tuesday’s hearing a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar fixed April 16 to hear the matter on a daily basis, even as an NGO claiming to represent men’s group maintained that married women have been given adequate protection under the law against sexual violence by their husbands.
 
 During the hearing the bench also posed questions to the men’s association if they are of the opinion a husband has a right to perpetrate sexual offence on his wife and can force sex on his spouse. “A rape is a rape. Is it that if you are married, it is okay but if you are not, then it’s a rape? If an uncle or grandfather sexually assaults a woman or a girl, it is covered under the offence of rape.”
 
 However, opposing the PIL seeking to make marital rape an offence, the NGO Men Welfare Trust claimed that the exception in Section 375 of the IPC, which says intercourse or a sexual act by a man with his wife is not rape, is “not unconstitutional” and setting it aside will create more injustice.
 
 It was opposing petitions filed by NGOs RIT Foundation and the All India Democratic Women’s Association, which have challenged the constitutionality of Section 375 (which defines rape) of the IPC on the ground that it discriminated against married women being sexually assaulted by their husbands. 
 
 The Centre has opposed the petitions saying marital rape cannot be made a criminal offence as it could become a phenomenon which may destabilise the institution of marriage and an easy tool for harassing the husbands.
