Born into a musical family,  , a singer and flautist, started singing when she was just one-and-a-half years old. She began training in   music when she was four and learnt to play the flute under her father’s, renowned Carnatic flautist  , guidance. Varijashree, who has performed with her father and given several solo performances in the past, has now delved into scat   compositions that has earned her praise from many. 

 “Scat is a style of singing used by Jazz singers to improvize. Scat uses gibberish/ syllables without meaning. I have always been amazed by this style of improvization, which has inspired me to try Scat singing using the Indian solfege system, or sargam. After being trained in Carnatic music, I started trying different interpretations of Jazz and other genres, and also began making my own music,” she says.
 
 The young musician tries to imbibe the principles of other music forms that have scope for a crossover. “It allows me to bring together two different forms of music and languages,” she says, adding that she has received positive feedback from people on social media. Varijashree is part of a South Asian contemporary cross-genre quartet called Chakrafonics. She has sung for   films and TV as well. Her unique music has been appreciated and she has been invited for several collaborations from artistes in India and abroad.
