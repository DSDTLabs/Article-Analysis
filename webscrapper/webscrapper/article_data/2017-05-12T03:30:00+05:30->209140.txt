Panaji: Following BJP’s decision to contest the byelections from Panaji constituency, chief minister Manohar Parrikar said Panaji was always on his mind when it came to contesting the byelections. He exuded confidence of winning the Panaji seat with a 30% vote margin. When questioned about his delayed decision, he said “the passing of the GST bill in assembly” was priority and he “never thought of any other place, but Panaji” to contest the byelection. Speaking to reporters, Parrikar thanked the people of Panaji and former Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienker for unanimously offering him the opportunity to contest the byelection from the state capital. He acknowledged MLA Nilesh Cabral, BJP workers in his constituency and the people of Curchorem for also offering him the opportunity to contest from Curchorem.  Parrikar said “both consitutencies will benefit” from having himself and Cabral in the assembly and added that he had promised the people of Curchorem that he would put in equal efforts for development of Curchorem and Panaji. He assured that the development works undertaken by Kuncalienker would be completed, but clarified that the entire state is his constituency and he would look after development in all constituencies. During the February 4 elections, Kuncalienker won the Panaji seat by over 1,000 votes and Parrikar claimed that wasn’t a narrow margin. “It is an 8% margin and that isn’t narrow. I will win by a 30% margin,” he said.   On reports of former St Cruz MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate planning to contest, Parrikar said, “It is a democratic set up and anyone and everyone is free to contest against me.” The former defence minister said the party’s central parliamentary board will decide whether Kuncalienker would be the BJP candidate for Rajya Sabha elections.
