BERHAMPUR: A meeting of the   (BeMC) on Wednesday was marred by corporator of ward 34 tendering his resignation and others staging a dharna. Amid all this, a balance budget of around Rs 286 crore for 2018-19 was passed. 

 B  , the   corporator of ward no. 34 tendered his resignation to the mayor, allegedly because the BeMC authorities neglected his advice to undertake development work. He staged a walkout and was joined by Namitarani Panda, the   corporator of ward 26, who protested against the proposed delimitation of the wards of BeMC. She alleged that the resolution on the proposed delimitation of wards passed during a special meeting of the corporators on February 19 was illegal. 
 
 Some other corporators, including those from BJD, too pressed for a reconsideration of the delimitation of wards in the corporation. 
 
 The corporation has decided to set up a common service centre to redress the grievances of the people through a single widow system. The civic body has also decided to buy two water tankers to transport and supply water in areas without any water connections. Currently, the BeMC has only one such tanker, sources said.
