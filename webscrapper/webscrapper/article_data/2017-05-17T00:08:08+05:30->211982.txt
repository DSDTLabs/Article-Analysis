Hyderabad: Even before the three-day deadline given to the   police by the Hyderabad high court to produce Tummala   ended, the 20-year-old girl was dead. The death has now brought fore the big question: Was it suicide or  ?

 The counsel for Amboji Venkataiah, who had moved a petition in the high court on Monday urging it to direct the police to produce his missing son, made moves to inform the high court of the latest development. The counsel N S Arjun Kumar contact the high court vacation officer and urged him to inform the bench of Swati’s demise and about the need to videograph the post-mortem. 
 
 He also contacted the Telangana state’s special government counsel Sarat Kumar. Arjun Kumar later informed the media that the special counsel had told him that he had already instructed the authorities to videograph the post-mortem. The vacation officer too said that a fresh plea needs to be filed in order to keep the bench informed of the latest developments, he said.
 
 He added that there are several suspicions regarding the alleged suicide of Swati and doubts abound whether it was a case of honour killing because she, as an upper caste Reddy woman, had married a backward class person against the wishes of her father. 
 
 Petitioner Venkataiah has now become more apprehensive of his son’s safety, he said, adding that in the fierce battle waged by a young couple against caste, it was unfortunate that caste had won and the state had failed.
