MUMBAI: The seventh and last body in the Pawan Hans   mishap was recovered and identified as that of ONGC employee V K Bindu Lal Babu on Thursday after an extended search operation about 40.1km (22 nautical miles) north-west from Uttan. 

 The body of the deputy general manager was identified by his wife, Shyni, a doctor, at Cooper Hospital from the clothes he had worn when he left home on Saturday. 
 
 The Coast Guard and the ONGC search team have now officially ended the search operations, said coast guard officials. “With this, mortal remains of all passengers including pilots on board the chopper have been recovered. Most of the aircraft debris, including critical components such as engines, landing gear, cockpit and flight data recorder, main gear box and tail gear box have already been collected by Coast Guard, ONGC and naval ships and handed over for investigation,” said an official.
 
 Babu’s body was in a decomposed condition, with a hand, leg and even his head missing. “The body was beyond recognition. Babu’s family members identified him with the help of the clothes he had last worn,” Santacruz police senior inspector Shantanu Pawar told TOI. 
 
 The family will perform his last rites around noon on Friday in Vasai. 
 
 ONGC remembered Babu as a disciplined and courageous officer. In 2005, while cheating death himself, he had saved many lives when a blaze engulfed an off-shore rig.
 
 The sixth body of pilot, Capt VC Katoch, was recovered on January 15, while the bodies of the other victims were recovered on January 13-14 after the Pawan Hans Dauphin helicopter crashed while flying to   on the morning of January 13.
