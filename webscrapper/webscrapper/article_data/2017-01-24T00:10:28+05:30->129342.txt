Chennai: The city’s   may finally be able to have a dignified way to fill their bellies, without having to scavenge for throwaways or digging dumpsters. A project that focuses squarely on managing wasted fresh-food will soon be handing out out proper meals and setting up open fridges for the homeless. All this, without a single rupee spent on preparing these meals.

 The ‘No Food Waste’ project, a crusade against food-waste that can stave off hunger for several of the state’s homeless inhabitants, will be working with Greater Chennai Corporation to accomplish this. The group will get untouched leftover food from collection points across cities and distribute it to the homeless, with an eye on localities which have quite a few of them. A G Padmanaban, the 23-year-old founder of the ‘No food Waste’ project, has sought the civic body’s support for his endeavour. 
 
 Parallelly, the project will also set up 2 fridges at restaurants/bakeries in its initial run to enable a “public take away” system for the homeless. “To accomplish this, we are currently mapping the city for ‘hunger spots’, areas with several clusters of homeless population,” says Padmanaban, who is looking for not just food donations, but also vehicles and volunteers. The crowd-funded initiative, he says, is also looking to take in donations from corporates and office buildings that account for a large amount of waste. Several IT companies, he reveals, including Zoho Corp, are keen on the tie-up.
 
 The project which was set to take off in 2016 had met with logistics issues “We have developed this model suited to the city’s locales this time, says Padmanaban.
 
 Channelling kilos of untouched leftover food to the needy, the project currently feeds people across Coimbatore, Erode, Salem, Trichy in the state and in Delhi the NCR area.
