MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the   on Monday ordered notice to the stateâ€™s transport and labour secretaries on a plea accusing officials of failing to discharge their duties by not properly checking vehicles which is resulting in more accidents. 

 Secretary of Tamil Nadu Annal Gandhi Driver, Conductor, Constructions non-formal organization, K V Subburaman filed the plea. When it came up for admission, the division bench headed by chief justice   ordered notice. 
 
 According to the petitioner, the owners of private transport companies who operate mini buses, trucks, lorries and tanker lorries have been exploiting their labourers to get maximum profit. 
 
 Many of the owners are not following rules and regulations pertaining to transport. For example, if a transport vehicle has been permitted to transport 16 tonne of load, the owners force the workers to load more than 35 tonne. Besides, the owners operate old obsolete vehicles. Those actions give a huge profit to the owners, but endanger the life and safety of workers which also causes environment pollution. 
 
 The officials are not properly checking the vehicles. They do it for namesake. In case any accident happened, the officials file cases against the drivers only and not against the owners who violated the norms. Authorities should ensure that the vehicles operated on roads do not violate the legal provisions. 
 
 Besides, if any worker refused to operate such vehicle, the owners immediately would remove them from the job and also informed other owners about it. To regulate the condition of the workers and for their welfare, there is Motor Transport Workers Act, as per which the transport company should get registered with the labour department which in turn should ensure that no worker is exploited by the owners. But in practice, it is not followed.
