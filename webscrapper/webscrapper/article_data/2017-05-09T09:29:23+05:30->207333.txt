HYDERABAD: The citizens of Hyderabad and even the high court have repeatedly asked the   over the years to find a solution to the problem of   encroachments, but the corporation says it does not have the staff or resources required to pull it off.

 Speaking to TOI, B  ,   assistant commissioner, Circle 18, said they hardly have any staff to look into the encroachments. “In our circle, it’s just me and a section officer and we have to take care of all the work. We don’t have any equipment — lorries, JCB or labourers. Every time we go on a drive, we have to get our own labour and pay them from our pocket to demolish any unmovable encroachments. When it comes to movable encroachments, hawkers return as soon we move to the next lane,” he said.
 
 He added the government should hire at least four to five section officers and provide them with equipment and labour to solve the issue. “Everyone blames us for footpath encroachments and there are cases against us in courts,   and human rights commission. But no one knows that we are working with very limited resources,” he said, adding that the situation is more or less similar in all the GHMC circles.
 
 When questioned about the encroachments by government bodies, he said, “The state should send strict instructions to prevent various government organizations from using footpaths as parking lots. We can’t do anything as police are the ones who have the responsibility of fining them,” said Reddy.
