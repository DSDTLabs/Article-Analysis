THANE: A suspended police officer from Thane, who had been booked for abetting a woman constable's suicide, was arrested on Friday. Constable   (22), who was attached to Thane police headquarters, allegedly hanged herself in a house in Kalwa on September 6 last year. 

 The accused, assistant commissioner of police  , who was also attached to the Thane police headquarters, had been booked in Subhadra's suicide case. 
 
 A senior police officer said that Nipunge's arrest comes after the   rejected his pre-arrest bail.
 
 Subhadra's brother, constable  , had lodged a complaint against against Nipunge and Subhadra's fiance, constable  . The two were booked for abetting the suicide. Paphale had also been arrested in the case, said a police officer.
 
 A police officer said that according to the complaint, the two had been mentally torturing Subhadra. He said that Nipunge frequently called Subhadra, sparking a tiff between Subhadra and her fiance and ultimately leading to her death. The complaint also stated that Nipunge had promised Subhadra a "good posting if she agreed to meet him," said a police officer.
 
 Initially, the police went slow on the probe, giving Nipunge a chance to move the sessions court for anticipatory bail. After the sessions court rejected the application, he moved the high court, which granted him interim relief. But apprehending arrest, Nipunge moved to the SC, which rejected the plea and asked him to surrender. On Friday, Nipunge 'surrendered' to the Kalwa police. He has been sent to police custody.
