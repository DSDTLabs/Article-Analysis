PANAJI: All India Congress Committee ( ) secretary and Goa desk in-charge A   will arrive in Goa on a two-day visit on Friday to hold closed-door discussions regarding the next Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president. He is expected to recommend around three names to the party high command even as former youth Congress president Girish Chodankar is the frontrunner for the post. 

 While AICC president   is keen on young blood taking leadership,   MLA   has also emerged as a strong contender for the post. 
 
 "I have been in touch with everyone over the last two days. I have to consult all the senior MLAs and leaders to know their views," Chella Kumar said.
 
 Along with Chodankar, Yatish Naik also has a strong shot at the post though Yatish has said he is not keen on taking on the mantle.
 
 The new president will face the challenging task of galvanising the party for the next parliamentary polls, which is just a year way, a political observer said.
 
 "I have to put up a panel of maybe three Congressmen before the party president but how long the decision will take I don't know," Chella Kumar told TOI. "Rahul Gandhi takes a daily update about the situation in Goa and he is concerned about the existing political situation," he added
