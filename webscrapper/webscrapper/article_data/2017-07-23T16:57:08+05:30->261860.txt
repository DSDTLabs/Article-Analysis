 Referring to the probe into the death of Sharath Madivala, he said that the BJP did not have enough confidence in a police investigation. “BJP and pro-Hindu activists are being targeted for the past four years since the Congress government came to power. When the BJP was in power, no Congress worker was attacked or killed. But, in the past four years, 24 pro-Hindu activists have been hacked to death.

 Alleging the involvement of Karnataka forest minister B Ramanath Rai, also the district in-charge minister, in the murder of Madivala, Ashok added, “Rai is visiting places of worship in the name of restoring normalcy.” Charging the CM of engaging in votebank politics, he said, “Members of SDPI and PFI are creating trouble in Dakshina Kannada.”
