Embroidered lehengas and mermaid gowns with ruffles and frills were the highlights on Day 6 of the India Couture Week

 
 
 From unicorns to castles ­designer Gaurav Gupta picked up elements from fairytales for his couture line. With mermaid gowns with frills and ruffles, puffed sleeves and bodycon dresses prepared with a mesh from Italy, Gaurav's collection was more about contemporary haute couture, not Indian bridal wear. There were a few sari drape-inspired gowns, but the designer chose to stay away from the traditional Indian designs and styles. Gaurav used fabrics like chiffon, dupion, tulle, net and laces, which were “prepared in-house from scratch.“ He said, “This collection is like wearable art, as a lot of attention has been paid to structuring and embroidered motifs.“ Actress Aditi Rao Hydari walked the ramp for the designer in a classic off-white gown with a long trail. The actress said, “I think he always saves the best for me. He is some one who has always encouraged me and dressed me the best.“
  
  
  
 
 Apart from the collection, Anita Dongre's show on Day 6 of the India Couture Week was also talked about for its music. Anita's couture line focused on handcrafted techniques and fabrics from India. Anita shared that her collection was a tribute to Rajasthan's Bishnoi tribe, which works to wards conservation of nature. Some of the embroidery was done by artisans from Gujarat. From resham thread embroidery to zardozi and gotapatti work, there was a range of traditional Indian karigari show cased in couture line. Talking about her collection, Anita said, “This reflects my love for Indian craftsmanship.“ Anita's show was the first in the couture week where kids also matched steps with the models on the ramp. “That was just to describe our Indian weddings, where the bride has a group of brides maids who are all dressed in a similar fashion, I just love that,“ said Anita.
