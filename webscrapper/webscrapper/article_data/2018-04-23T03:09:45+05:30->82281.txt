 “People ridiculed me when I decided to go on a hunger strike, saying how could a woman go on a hunger strike. But, today, I can say that a woman can achieve anything,” she said.

We, the people, should be those hands. Laws alone don’t change society,” he said. Among other demands raised by Jaihind were recruitment of police personnel as per UN standards, fixing accountability of police and setting up a high-level committee to review issues related to safety of women in the capital.
