BENGALURU: A second year   (BBM) from Bengaluru was arrested on Monday for posting nude photos on   of his ex-girlfriend for breaking their relationship. Accused Shouvik Bhawan (22) also threatened to make the photos of their intimate moments   at their hometown in Tejpur at Assam if the victim does not continue the relationship. Bhawan has also put the victim's mobile number on Instagram showing her as prostitute and anyone can contact her, said the MIDC police.

 Victim registered the case after learning from her friends about her photos posted on the social media and even received calls from people asking for her rate for a night. Bhawan was arrested a month after the victim who is doing post-graduation in Mumbai-based college lodged complaint with the MIDC police station.
 
 “Bhawan has posted at least 20 nudes photos of the victim on Instagram. He even posted her mobile number showcasing her prostitute and asked to contact her to spend a night,“ said a police officer.
 
 Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone X) Navinchandra Reddy supervised the MIDC police senior inspector Shailesh Pasalwar and team who arrested Bhawan on learning about his visit in Mumbai to meet the victim. “Bhawan has been blackmailing and threatening the victim by posting her nude photos on Instagram. He even threatened to malign her name at their village in Assam if she does not abide him. Youngsters should be aware of the consequences of social media and one should take utmost care and should not share any photos that will backfire them and can be used as a weapon for blackmailing,“ said Pasalwar.
