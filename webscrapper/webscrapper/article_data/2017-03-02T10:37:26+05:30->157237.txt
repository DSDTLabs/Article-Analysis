 The guesthouse, a la the   in New Delhi, is to come up at a 32.76-acre ‘Jagannath Enclave’, which the Odisha government proposes to develop on the Puri-Konark Marine Drive.
 
 The enclave is being developed by the Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Developmen Corporation (IDCO), a nodal agency of the Odisha government for providing industrial infrastructure in the state.
