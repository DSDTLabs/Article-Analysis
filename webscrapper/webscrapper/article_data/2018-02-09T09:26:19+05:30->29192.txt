VIJAYAWADA: The war between TDP and   seems to be intensifying, with the TDP's social media wing going all out to spread the protest online. The media wing has generated images captioned 'Justice for Andhra' to be used as profile pictures by users. 

 The social media wing has also circulated to the party rank and file data on the injustice meted out to the state. Many TDP volunteers have changed their profile pictures and are regularly posting updates and protest posts using 'Justice for Andhra Pradesh' tag. The caption along with profile picture read, 'When   was given so huge funds, why not Vijayawada or   metro?' 
 
 Some TDP volunteers have also started posting videos accusing Prime Minister   of being a liar who has failed to fulfil the promises made to AP. 
 
 "Social media is a free and powerful platform. The speech of Guntur MP   questioning the Union government in Parliament went viral on social media. We want the rest of the states to know what the BJP has done to Andhra Pradesh," an activist said.
