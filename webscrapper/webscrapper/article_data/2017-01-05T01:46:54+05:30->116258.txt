MUMBAI: With a month to go for the BMC elections, chief minister   has decided to allot the four-acre mayor’s   premises in the prime   locality for a Bal Thackeray  .

 The urban development department, headed by the CM, has issued a notification that the land will be leased to the Balasaheb Thackeray Memorial Trust for the next 30 years at a nominal rate of Re 1 per year. “The notification will be published in a day or two,” said a Mantralaya official. Considering that it is a heritage structure, the ground-plus-one bungalow will be converted into a memorial with minor changes.
 
 The opposition has opposed the decision, taken days before the code of conduct for the elections is expected to come into effect. “It’s clear that the decision has been taken with an eye on the BMC polls,” said Sachin Sawant, general secretary, Maharashtra Congress. “We are not against the memorial but why at the mayor’s bungalow? Memories of the late Sena supremo are in Matoshree. Eyeing government land for the memorial is not a good idea,” said Sawant.
 
 A BJP leader said on the condition of anonymity that the decision would help soften Shiv Sainiks towards BJP, in case the saffron allies decide to contest the crucial polls separately. Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had been demanding that the mayor’s bungalow be allotted for his father’s memorial. The state subsequently formed a committee under chief secretary Swadhin Kshatriya, which visited several sites in Mumbai but zeroed in on the mayor’s bungalow for the memorial. Now, an 11-member trust, including Sena leaders Aaditya Thackeray and Subhash Desai, will finalize the design of the memorial. The trust will be controlled by the government though.
