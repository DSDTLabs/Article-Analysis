He is an actor who needs no introduction, for his body of work speaks for itself.   is one personality the   audience have been wanting to see for a long time on   and looks like this desire is about to come true. The multi-lingual star and Kannada’s own son of the soil is set to open Season 3 of the popular show and will grace the iconic red chair on March 25.
 “The show as been a unique experience for me because I looked back on my life — something which I never do otherwise. I’m someone who always looks ahead, so this experience changed it all,” shares Prakash. “I got to see a lot of people right from school, college and theatre days. It was interesting to see how they perceive me now. It is only then that realisation hit me that not only have I grown as a person, but they’ve grown as people, too,” avers Prakash. There were many surprises in store as is the case with each show. “They had managed to trace one of my teachers from primary school and it was interesting to note some of the episodes she mentioned with regard to me,” he tells us.
  Prakash’s mentors GK Govind Rao and HS Venkateshmurthy, who also taught him in college, came on the show as did senior journalist Vijayamma. “They are extremely special because they chiselled me into the person I became. My interest in literature and the arts were further enhanced because of them,” concurs Prakash. Little known aspects like the actor’s avid interest in natural farming also found a mention on the show. “At the end of the day, I’m not just an actor. My life experiences have shaped me in becoming who I am. My interests, too are varied and those include nature, photography, wildlife and social work. I am on a journey and on the show, you will get a glimpse of it,” sums up Prakash.
