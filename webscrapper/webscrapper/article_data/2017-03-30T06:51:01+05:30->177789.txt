AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Wednesday asked   to explain how it could go ahead and preference to its students in admissions to postgraduate (PG) medical courses, when the state government is following the procedure of common counselling rule.

 The HC is hearing petitions filed by two sets of students – one is from GU who opposed the common counselling system on the basis of NEET-PG exam score and insists that GU follow the preference system, while the other are from other universities who support the state government’s decision.
 
 The court told GU that before the MCI guideline on the basis of the   order to follow common counselling system, GU could give preference to students who passed   courses from colleges affiliated to it. But with the introduction of common counselling, if GU continues to adhere to the old practice, students from districts like Kutch and Patan will have no future.
 
 Further hearing is kept on April 3.
