CHANDIGARH: Liquor bottles in Chandigarh start carrying 3-D holograms from next week. The move of UT excise and taxation department aims at putting a check on illegal sale of liquor in Chandigarh.

 UT excise and taxation commissioner Ajit Balaji Joshi said that holograms would be equipped with the tracking facility enabling the department to ascertain the movement of the liquor stock. This will prevent the liquor from being smuggled out of Chandigarh besides ensuring that the duty is paid on the stock in possession of any particular dealer, he further added.
 
 Manipal Technologies Limited, a company having a experience and expertise in design of such holograms has been selected. The firm will be providing these at a price of 8 paise per  .
 
 A team of senior officers of the department comprising of  , additional excise and taxation commissioner, and Ravinder Kaushik, assistant excise and taxation commissioner (AETC), had also visited the manufacturing unit of the company at Manipal to ensure that the best quality 3D holograms are procured for use by the department. The first consignment of the holograms has been received which would now be issued to the licensees for their pasting on every single bottle of liquor.
 
 The department has urged the users to check these holograms on every purchase made by them to ensure its genuineness. The move would help the department in safeguarding its revenue as the sale and purchase of liquor would now be monitored regularly. 
 
 There are a total of 99 vends in the 48 groups spread in different parts of the city.   president   said that the department took the decision without consulting the liquor traders. “Every trader has old stock and they should be allowed to sell it on old pattern,” said Pal.
