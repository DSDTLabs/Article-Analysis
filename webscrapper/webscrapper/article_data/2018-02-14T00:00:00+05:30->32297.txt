Bengaluru-based band   have never shied away from experimenting, and their latest track is proof of that. The   has collaborated with actress Shalini Pandey of   fame for a   pop rock number titled Na Pranamay, which releases today. Speaking about the track, vocalist Tejas Shankar says, “This is our first song in Telugu. It is a romantic number, but has pop-rock elements. The whole emotion is premised on love.”

 What prompted the band to collaborate with Shalini, we ask? “We know her on a personal level. In addition to that, the band has always wanted to experiment, not only with the genre, but also with the artistes that we collaborate with. We came across Shalilni’s social media videos and realized that she is a good singer, in addition to being a good actor. We had written the song and thought she was perfect,” he says. The song has been conceptualized and directed by Kannada cinematographer Karm Chawla; it was recorded in Hyderabad and shot in Bengaluru. “Since the song is about love, we thought that it would be perfect to release it on Valentine’s Day,” Tejas sums up.
