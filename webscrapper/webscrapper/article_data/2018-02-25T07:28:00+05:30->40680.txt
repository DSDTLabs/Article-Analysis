LUDHIANA: Heavy rain in the morning and violent incidents throughout the day kept   to merely 59.08% in the Ludhiana MC elections, almost 4% lesser than that recorded in 2012 elections.

 The maximum voting was recorded in ward number 5 where 73.17% polling was reported and lowest voter turnout (47.73%) was recorded from ward number 30.
 
 Now the fate of 494 candidates, who were in the fray in these elections, will be out on February 27 when results for 95 wards of the city will be declared.
 
 On Saturday, polling for 95 wards of the city started on a slow note as rain and bad weather kept voters away from polling booths.
 
 The voting picked up gradually but it could not cross the figure of previous MC polls. The officials claimed that it was due to bad weather that people did not come out to vote in the beginning, but voting was smooth in the later hours.
 
 Sources said rumours related to booth capturing and clashes also kept the voters away. Voter turnout was only 13.04% at 10am, which increased to 30.54% by 12 noon and then to 46.15% by 2pm. However, when the voting came to end at 4pm, the total poll percentage had gone up to 59.08%.
 
 The district administration however claimed that polling was completed in fair and peaceful manner.
 
 Deputy commissioner-cum-district electoral officer   said polling was peaceful as all arrangements were in place to ensure the same. “The counting will take place and results will be announced on February 27. Till then   machines would be kept under tight security,”   said.
 
 Out of the total voter turnout, 59.70% were male voters, 57.66% were female voters and 4.17% were third gender voters.
 
 Around 63% polling was reported in MC elections in 2012.
