Other major concern is poor drainage system. “When a road is constructed, nobody gives much attention to the need of a proper drainage system,“ he said.

 Kerala water authority ( ), Kerala state electricity board (KSEB), public works department (PWD) and private parties dig roads for laying pipes and cables. “If there is coordination betwe en these agencies, then laying of cables can be done before the road construction starts,“ he said.
