AMRAVATI: The weeklong Chikhaldara Tourism Festival, in which various activities that attract tourists from across Maharashtra, will be held from   12 to 18 this year.

 Earlier, the festival used to be celebrated for three days. However, guardian minister Pravin Pote has instructed the district administration to increase the duration to a week given the fact that it evokes enthusiasm from nature lovers too. The festival was introduced some eight years back by former minister Dr Sunil Deshmukh. However, the organizers stopped holding the festival in later years. The festival was revived last year, keeping in mind the potential it has to general revenue. 
 
 Food festival, adventure sports like parasailing, rappling and trekking, and a picture exhibition on Melghatâ€™s biodiversity will be the special features this year. The festival provides tribals an opportunity to showcase their bamboo art and forms of folk culture. It also helps in employment generation as items made by tribals are sold at the festival.
 
 Melghat MLA Prabhudas Bhilawekar, Chikhaldara municipal president Rajendra Singh Somwanshi, district collector Kiran Gitte, ZP CEO Kiran Kulkarni and other officers were present at a review meeting held at the collectorate. Assuring adequate funds for the festival, Pote insisted on involving local talent and instructed to promote and propagate the festival at the state level. Gitte asked MTDC to rope in tourists with lucrative offers.
