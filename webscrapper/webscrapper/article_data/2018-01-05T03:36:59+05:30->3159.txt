NEW DELHI: “It seems like my daughter has been killed a second time,” said 59-year-old   with tears welling up in her eyes when the judge left the courtroom after commuting the death sentence for two of Jigisha Ghosh’s killers.

 It has been a long battle for the Ghosh family. “We have been praying for justice. These men killed my daughter, the sole earning member of our family, just for fun. She had pleaded with them to let her go and take her money, but they refused to listen and killed her. How can they be let off with just life imprisonment?” asked Sabita.
 
 The family has been running from pillar to post seeking justice for their daughter. Jigisha’s father, Jagannath, is now a neurology patient and had helped police gather evidence. “If it was not for the support by the then DCP (south) and the other police officers, we would not have come this far. The court didn’t consider the evidence and witnesses we gathered while commuting the death sentence. We have no option but to approach a higher court,” said the father.
 
 The distraught family was consoled by the parents of another victim,  , who was killed by the same accused. Her father, MK Vishwanathan, feared that the life sentence of the killers could also be commuted. “They are hardened criminals who can come out on parole even while serving a life sentence. Is there any guarantee that they won’t do such a crime again? There is just one assurance that they will be spending their entire life in jail,” he said.
 
 “I had seen the two accused, Ravi Kapoor and Amit Shukla, after their arrest. They admitted to having killed our daughters. There is evidence and witnesses to back it,” said Vishwanathan. His family is awaiting a date with the trial court for sentencing in Soumya’s  .
