BENGALURU: Two neurosurgeons of Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Whitefield, are under the police scanner for alleged negligence, as a part of the skull of a 25-year-old man they had operated upon, has gone missing.

 Police registered a case against Dr B   and Dr   based on a complaint filed by patient   V’s mother,  , from Chikkamagaluru. Manjunath told TOI he was devastated by the turn of events. With the top right part of the skull bone flap removed, he said the scalp was the only protection for the brain and even scratching his head with a straw could injure it.
 
 However, Dr   told TOI that the patient’s family had not understood the procedures despite being clearly told the part cannot be replaced. The FIR was registered on February 2 under Section 338 (Causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of IPC. “We have sought supporting documents from the complainant about the allegations. We will summon or question the accused once we find a prima facie case against them during our probe,” an officer said.
 
 According to the FIR, a copy of which is with TOI, Manjunath was suffering from headache and was admitted to Vydehi Hospital for treatment on February 2, 2017. The doctors told his family that Manjunath had a blood clot in the brain and he required an immediate surgery to save his life.
 
 The doctors removed a bone flap from Manjunath’s skull during surgery, saying that the brain had swollen and the flap would be replaced later, Rukminiyamma said. When they went back to the hospital later seeking surgery for replacement of the skull flap, Guruprasad and Rajesh told them the part had been thrown into a dustbin, she alleged.
 
 Manjunath has two young daughters and his widowed mother works as a domestic help to support his treatment and the family. “I was the sole earning member of the family. Now, I can’t do any work to frequent headaches and my friends told my mother about it.”
