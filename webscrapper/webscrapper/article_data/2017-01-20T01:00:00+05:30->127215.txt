They are American royalty in terms of actors. I can’t understand how this has happened, I’m shocked and I’m still reeling from it. These are the women because of whom I wanted to do TV in  . They have created a space for themselves. They are forward-thinking, female lead characters who are inspirational for people around the world. They have played such amazing characters and   (Parrish, her character in ' ') is a representation of a modern woman, which is why so many women relate to her. Just being in the same category as these women was a dream come true for me. I didn’t expect to win in this category. I am overwhelmed and grateful to everyone who voted and everyone who loved the show.

 
 I had a concussion and before this, I didn’t know what a concussion was. The doctor told me that I can’t watch TV, read books, or focus my eyes on anything. After three days of sitting at home, I got so bored that I put on my neck brace, which I was supposed to wear, and went back to work. I took it off during the shots. I have been given permission to travel, so I am good now. I just can’t do action and stunts for another week.
 
 
 That’s a good thing, right? I just wanted to wear something springy. I was shooting in   and it was very cold there. But when I came to Los Angeles, I felt like wearing something fun, easy and light. I just wanted to let my hair down, so I chose this outfit. I always have fun on the red carpet, I don’t take it seriously. I wear dresses depending on my mood and that’s what I did.
