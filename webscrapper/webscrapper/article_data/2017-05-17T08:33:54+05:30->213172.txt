MYSURU: The officebearers of the health and sanitation   of   ( ) seized a   which was functioning for many decades allegedly without valid permits, including trade and food licences, here on Tuesday. 

 Following complaints from people, shop owners in the neighbourhood and the pollution control board, the committee, led by president   and MCC health officers Dr   and Dr   and other civic officials visited the mill, much to the chagrin of the mill owner. Initially, he was reluctant to come out and speak to the visiting team. 
 
 The committee members, who were upset with the attitude of the owner, staged a protest in front of the mill. Even after additional police force was summoned to the spot, the owner did not come out. However, he heeded the order only after MCC authorities started seizing food materials kept in the premises.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Dr Nagaraj said: “The flour mill had been running without valid licence for the past many decades. When the pollution control board questioned the owner about the noise pollution because of the mill, its owner approached a court. Because of this, we could not act against the mill. But the unhygienic food supplied from there to public did it in. 
 
 We have seized weighing machines and some food stuff which we have sent for testing. On couple of occasions earlier, we had given notice to the owner to obtain licence, but to no avail. We have seized the mill in the interest of public health.” 
 
 Corporator Prashanth was present during the raid.
