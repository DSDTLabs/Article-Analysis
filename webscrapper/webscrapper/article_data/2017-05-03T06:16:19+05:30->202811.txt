LUCKNOW: The WhatsApp   for complaints regarding streetlights is showing a limited impact in the first few days of its launch. 

 The staff mobilised for this service is only handling individual streetlight complaints while ignoring long  . Officials say they need approval for funds from seniors to install new lampposts and lights. 
 
 While the deadline to repair a single streetlight is 24 hours, there is no such deadline to install new streetlights in a dark area. One can see such dark patches across city like on the road in front of the forest department in Narhi, from Nehru Enclave towards Jugauli, inner roads of  , sectors 14 and 16 of Indiranagar, Dayanidhan Road, the road going from Novelty to Odeon cinema and Church Road of Vikasnagar, among others. 
 
 An official in charge said, “We have permission to repair individual streetlights but cannot handle complaints of long dark patches as we have to seek permission for grant of funds for new lights and poles. We can take three-four days or even more considering the extent of work and/or delay in approval to fix these lights.”
 
 On a daily basis, LMC receives about 12 complaints on   number 9415008409 for streetlights. 
 
 While a damaged streetlight is repaired in a time-bound manner, the attempt is defeated when it comes to addressing issues of dark stretches of roads. 
 
 The service was also initiated to ensure that no streetlight remains switched on beyond 6am. According to LMC, it has received 96 complaints on WhatsApp till now. Of these, seven were pertaining to lights remaining on in broad daylight.
