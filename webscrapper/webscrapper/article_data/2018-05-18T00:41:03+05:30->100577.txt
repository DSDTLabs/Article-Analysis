Jaipur: The high court on Thursday deferred the hearing on fee hike at the Vidyashram School after more parents approached the court seeking a stay on the hike in fees. The single bench of the high court had earlier directed the parents of students studying at Vidyashram School in Pratap Nagar to deposit the fee before the hike while acting on another set of petitions, the high court gave relief to only the petitioners of another branch of the school at K N Munshi Road.

 Citing the previous orders, more parents had approached the high court seeking relief from the hiked fee. The petitioners said the maximum fee hike effected is 48%. The court said the matter would be heard on May 22.
 
 Earlier the state government had cancelled the no objection certificate (NOC) issued by the state government after the school was accused of hiking fee without consulting the fees committee of the school as per the provisions of Rajasthan Fees (Regulation) Rules 2017.
 
 HC reinstates Dausa municipal chairman
 
 Jaipur: The high court on Thursday reinstated the Dausa municipal council chairman Rajkumar Jaiswal who was deposed through a no-confidence motion in January this year. The division bench of Justice M N Bhandari and D C Somani said the no-confidence motion cannot be considered legal as it had not taken into account the ex-officio members votes. The MP and MLA of the area are the ex-officio members of the municipal council.
 
 Council for the petitioner, R B Mathur said two-third of the members had to vote for a motion to remove a chairman of the municipal council. When considering the vote of the ex-officio members, the vote against the chairman falls short of the required two-third majority.
