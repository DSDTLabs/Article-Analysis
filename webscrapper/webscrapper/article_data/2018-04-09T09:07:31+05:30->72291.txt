PATIALA: Two days after camping in the national capital, Craig Doody, father of the 24-year-old Jessica Doody, who is reportedly at a mental age of 14 years, has decided to approach Union minister for external affairs   to seek her help in getting his daughter back.

 Craig said some of his friends in India have already tweeted to the Union minister and he would also tweet her with details of his daughter, who he claimed has landed herself in a “very vulnerable situation.”
 
 The father has already approached the   high commissioner in India, who assured him that they would take up the matter with   police again. His family in New Zealand has also reached out to their government seeking more support.
 
 Jessica’s sister   Doody said, “Jessica was autistic and had dyspraxia, which affected her ability to gauge social situations.” She said the family was afraid that Jessica did not understand the intentions of people as her understanding was limited. “The family was apprehensive that she was not safe in India and if at all she disappeared we would never be able to get back to her”, Sarah said.
 
 She said the family was shocked that Jessica managed to change her name and fly out of New Zealand despite a court order barring her from travelling alone out of the country.
 
 “I had been successful in acquiring a travel ban for Jessica, which is very hard in New Zealand. The ban was recent but before that Jessica got her name changed and flew out of the country. It definitely confirms she was suffering from mental inabilities.”
 
 She said the family had received little help from New Zealand officials as they were not even told in which part Jessica was by the New Zealand police. She said Jessica’s personal security outweighs all other laws."
 
 Meanwhile, Craig said he would not leave the country without Jessica and he is taking help from a few friends in India for this.
