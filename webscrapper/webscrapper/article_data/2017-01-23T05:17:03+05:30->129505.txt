MUMBAI: The state government has come across major irregularities in insurance claims made by farmers in 2015. Most anomalies were reported from Marathwada, the worst affected region in the 26 drought-hit districts that year. The state government had disbursed a record Rs 4,205 crore as insurance.
The state agriculture department is investigating all insurance claims made by farmers after it came to light that in   district alone, Rs 58 crore insurance money that was sanctioned for farmers was claimed illegally.
 
 A report on the incident said over 15,000 farmers from the district had fraudulently claimed insurance for a larger area of cultivation, or for premium paid for crops they had not even sowed.
 
 The episode was investi gated by Beed collector Naval   when it emerged that the cultivated land shown as insured was much higher than the area available for cultivation in the district.
 
 According to norms, a farmer has to get a crop certificate from the local revenue official mentioning the area under cultivation and the crop he will sow to get insured.
 
 The farmer would get a crop-sowing certificate from the land revenue officer. He would later go back saying he would be sowing another crop and hence would need another certificate. The farmer would take these two certificates to two different banks and pay the insurance premium for both crops, but sow only one crop. In these cases, insurance claims were admitted for both crops.
 
  secretary   confirmed the incident and said a probe is on.
