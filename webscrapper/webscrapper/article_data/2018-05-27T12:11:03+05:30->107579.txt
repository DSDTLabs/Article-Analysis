BENGALURU: Former Advocate General of Karnataka   on Saturday said the independence of   in the country is being threatened and urged the Supreme Court to put up a united front to fight this.

 
 
 Speaking at the launch of Anita Gets Bail, authored by journalistturned politician Arun Shourie, Acharya cited the example of the   not approving Justice KM Joseph’s candidature for the post of Chief Justice of India and said: “The Centre didn’t clear his name because of personal grudges, and gave trivial reasons for doing so.”
 
 Arguing that the Centre is disobeying the law, Acharya also said several court orders are not being complied with. “Among all the institutions, it is only the judiciary that helps people. And it has several deficiencies as pointed out in Shourie’s book. It is important that we prevent the falling apart of the institution. The book also has some remedies that may work,” Acharya said.
 
 Former Lokayukta Santosh Hegde, while stating that the problems must be resolved by the institutions themselves, however, said: “But the institutions have failed in doing so.” He added that when the judiciary fails and people lose faith in it, it will lead to the fall of democracy.
 
 Shourie, who has pointed out various issues plaguing the judiciary, said deterioration of societal values has magnified. Quoting Mahatma Gandhi in his speech, Shourie said: “The judiciary is the last institution left and the people of India must wake up to keep it intact.” He said institutions in India are failing because termites from within the country are eating them up and not because of an external blow. Hegde, almost echoing this view, said: “Society is the reason behind the fall of institutions in the country. And the time has come for the judiciary to show to the people of India that they are taking steps to improve the system.”
