HYDERABAD: The recent incident of alleged hate crime in the US, which left   dead, dominated the annual ‘State of the city’ address of  ,  , on Friday.

 Usually, the primary objective of the annual address is to make citizens aware of what has been done for the city and detail future plans. This time, Copeland’s opening remarks were about the incident that occurred at Austin’s Bar and Grill on February 22. “In Olathe, we will not let evil stand. We are going to show goodness and the goodness of the people of Olathe, the goodness of our community. That’s what we want to talk about because that’s who we are,” the Mayor said. He was speaking at the Olathe Conference Centre.
 
 With Olathe being in the news for the wrong reasons, the Mayor took the opportunity to drive home the point that the city should not be judged based on one racial crime. “That event does not represent who Olathe is. What has this tragedy showed us about our community? It reaffirmed who we are. It showed our strength is our different origins, melded into this compassionate, inclusive and united community,” he said. “No act of evil will divide us. We will never allow hatred and bigotry to stand. We remain one Olathe,” the Mayor added.
 
 Wishing Alok Madasani a “speedy recovery”, he also mentioned Ian Grillot, the man who jumped in to help the victims. “Ian stood up for strangers and nearly gave his life for them. We pray that those in mourning will find comfort in the outpouring of love and support across our community,” the Mayor said.
