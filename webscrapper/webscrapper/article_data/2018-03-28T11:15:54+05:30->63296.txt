NAGPUR: “Indian doctors have proven their mantle very well both at home and abroad. They are known worldwide for their accurate diagnosis and treatment. But mostly, all of them are far away from medical research. Research is never a priority for them unlike the doctors in abroad where almost all doctors are engaged in research. There is need for doctors thus to get into research,” said Dr Ashish Satav of Mahan Trust Melghat.

 Dr Satav was speaking at the 71st foundation day programme of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) organized by the college students.
 
 Sharing his experience about Melghat, Dr Satav told all the students to at least devote one year in rural and tribal areas. Giving examples of Bangs and Amtes, he told the students to look for their own role models and dedicate some part of their career for rural patients. 
 
 Dr Satav gave his own example on managing to reduce the infant mortality rate. He clarified that in rural areas remaining restricted to one’s own speciality doesn’t work. Dr Kavita Satav, an ophthalmologist, besides treating eye problems has also been delivering babies and treating them. In Melghat, the Arogya doots organize milk sharing among mothers who have breast milk and those who don’t after delivery and Dr Kavita has managed to guide the Arogya doots to make the experiment work.
 
 A student narrated his experience as a medical officer in Melghat. He said that the doctors were told to manipulate the data and not show deaths due to malnutrition.
 
 Dr A Niswade, the GMCH dean, in his talk told the students to think big. He said that GMCH had produced some of the biggest doctors from the country who were very well placed both in India and abroad. 
 
 Dr Uday Narlawar, Dr Ganesh Dhakle and Dr M Mudeshwar were also present on the occasion.
