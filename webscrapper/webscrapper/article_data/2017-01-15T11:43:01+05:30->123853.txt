MYSURU: While   has been declared the first city in the country to be rid of  , the district stands 17th place in the state in cleanliness,  . By December last year, only two of the 90 gram panchayats scored hundred per cent on this count. 

 The neighouring districts like Mandya, Kolar,   and Chikkamagaluru have achieved huge success, Mysuru has shown little improvement in the programme under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.   statistics reveal that of the 90 gram panchayats and 795 villages in seven taluks in the district, only two GPs and 137 villages achieved 100 per cent success.
 
  The two gram panchayats are in K R Nagar and Periyapatna taluks. The worst performer is Hunsur taluk where of the 435 villages, only 38 villages are open-defecation free and in Mysuru taluk, of 300 villages, just 28 have reached the target. 
 
 ZP social justice standing committee chairman Beerihundi Basavanna said panchayat development officers and executive officers have to work hard. "In my constituency, there's been a success rate of 80 per cent in Mattikyathanahalli, 50 per cent in Beerihundi and Gopalapura and other villages. Officials need to take the lead," he said.
 
  ZP chief executive officer P Shivashankar said the ZP plans to rope in religious leaders to create awareness. "There is a cultural problem in making the programme a success. We plan to involve religious leaders and politicians to spread the word."
 
 There is also a finance crunch. The Centre has agreed to provide Rs 417 lakh but released only Rs 250 lakh. "We have diverted funds from the National Rural Livelihood Mission given to Self-Help Groups towards the construction of toilets. When the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan funds are released, the amount will be repaid to the accounts," he said.
 
  CEO Shivashankar said the ZP has set a target to make all Hunsur taluks 100 cent open defecation free by March-end.
