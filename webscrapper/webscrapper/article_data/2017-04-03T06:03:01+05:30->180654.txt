BENGALURU: From raising internal complaints to writing a letter to the Prime Minister's Office, various attempts by different CISF personnel deployed at   (KIA) notwithstanding, difficult working conditions, poor food, non-payment of allowances and alleged harassment by seniors have forced more than 200 of them to collectively seek legal aid.

 These complaints only reflect the poor treatment of   (CAPF) forces in the country, 344 of whom have committed suicide in the last three years - 15 of them in the first three months of 2017 - according to the ministry of home affairs.
 
 And, 15% or 53 are from CISF. Besides, there have also been 25 cases of fratricide, or, killing or firing at colleagues of which 52% or 13 of them are from CISF. One jawan shot himself at KIA using his service weapon in January, which the CISF and the local police attributed to personal reasons. However, indicating that not everything at KIA is hunky dory, one personnel said: “The standard of food is poor, we have break-less shifts, don't get house rent and transport allowances. There is ill treatment by seniors and even instances of salaries being cut arbitrarily.”
