ALLAHABAD:  ,  , said with the   extending support to its candidates, SP will defeat   Nanda was in Allahabad on Sunday to campaign for  , the SP candidate in fray from Phulpur in the Lok Sabha bypoll.

 Addressing the audience, Nanda said, “I have come to know that BSP chief Mayawati has asked her party workers to work hard to defeat the communal forces in UP byelections.”
 
 Predicting a massive win for his party, Nanda said that BJP was going to lose both the seats in bypolls.
 
 “People are fed up with the fake promises of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath,” said Nanda while claiming that the BJP-led Union and state governments have been exposed.
 
 He clarified that mafia-turned-politician Atiq Ahmad, who is contesting Phulpur bypoll as an Independent, is no longer a member of SP.
 
 “UP, being a secular state, has always been a stronghold of SP and we launched aseries of developmental projects across the state during out regime. BJP won 2017 assembly polls by cheating people, but Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls would determine the right direction for 2019 polls,” he said.
 
 The SP national vice-president said that Modi government was implementing the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh agenda in the country. “Modi government did not impose Goods and Services Tax (GST) on petroleum products as it wanted to ensure profit for some industrialists,” he said.
 
 Criticising the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), Nanda said that the polling in Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya was not impartial.
