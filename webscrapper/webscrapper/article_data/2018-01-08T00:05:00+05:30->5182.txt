Appearing on an inspirational talk show was high on dancer and choreographer Mayuri Upadhya’s bucket list, which she got to do recently. The event doesn’t have any  , but the makers of the TV show that is hosted by   handpicked seven artiste to create an extension of visual interpretation, taking inspiration from the talks. And the Bengaluru hudugi chose to poetically interpret the 100   Pact that was started by fellow Bengalurean Anju Kadam.

 “When the makers asked me create something that would strike a balance between art and TV, I thought about the 100 Sari Pact and the fact that it meant different things to different women. A sari is not just a drape, but a representation for many women. It speaks for their memories; when you read the pact stories, they are emotional and inspiring. The performance explores the relationship of a woman 
 with sari, looking at three stages — childhood, adolescence (womanhood) and motherhood. I had to encapsulate all of that in just three minutes and in under a weeks’ time, with five dancers, which was a tough job. It’s a milestone in my journey of dance,” says Mayuri, adding, “I even wore a traditional Karnataka sari to the show and made sure that I went there not just as a dancer, but as a Bengaluru hudugi as well.”
 
 If being on the show wasn’t exciting enough, and added bonus was getting to interact with the charismatic Shah Rukh Khan. “At the end of the show, I asked him if we could all take a picture with him. He said, ‘Picture nahi, I will take a selfie with each one of you’. We were taken aback when he took the phone and actually took selfies with each one of us,” Mayuri signs off.
