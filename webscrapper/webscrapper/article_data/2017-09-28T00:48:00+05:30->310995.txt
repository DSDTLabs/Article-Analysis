 Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday dismissed the plea of a converted Muslim youth seeking police job. 
 
 One Abdul Rahman from Madurai had sought a direction to the chairman of the Tamil Nadu Uniform Services Recruitment Board to treat him as backward class (Muslim) and to give appointment in the police department. The Tamil Nadu Uniform Services Recruitment Board held a recruitment drive to fill up the post of grade II police constable, grade II jail warden and firemen.
 
 A division bench of justices K Kalyanasundaram and S S Sundar, which heard the plea dismissed it after the government told that the youth did not produce necessary community certificate claiming BC (Muslim) during recruitment process. At the time of submitting his application, the petitioner submitted a community certificate, as per which he belongs to Hindu kallar community that comes under BC category, the government said.
 
 The Supreme Court had held in a case that recruitment should be completed before August this year. Accordingly, the board conducted a written examination in May and physical examination in August. Hence, the petitionerâ€™s claim could not be considered at this juncture, the government said. 
 
 The petitioner told the bench that he gave a gazette notification last year itself and the board issued a notification this year only. Besides, he now obtained the community certificate claiming BC (Muslim). He scored 56 marks in written and physical tests. The cut off mark for BC (Muslim) is 50. Hence, he needed to be treated as BC (Muslim) and given job, the petitioner prayed.
