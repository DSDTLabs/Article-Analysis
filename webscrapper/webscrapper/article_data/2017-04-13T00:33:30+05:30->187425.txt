Gurgaon: Police booked the owner of Jukaso club and his so for allegedly duping the director of an educational society of Rs 75 lakh by leasing their school site in Sector 56. The deal was finalised in 2016, but the victim later realised he had been duped, as the school site was also leased by the accused, which made his further leasing it out illegal. 

 The victim filed a police complaint in January. The FIR was registered against the duo at Civil Lines police station only on Tuesday, after preliminary probe by the economic offences wing (EOW).
 
 According to police, D K Sharma, director of Alpine Progressive Educational Society, which runs Alpine Convent School in Sector 56, lodged a police complaint on January 30 against Rajiv Khanna, chairperson of Jukaso Education Society, and his   Yajush Khanna, who have been running Golden Heights School on site number 4, Sector 56, for 15 years. Sharma said the duo had duped him of Rs 75 lakh by leasing the school site fraudulently.
 
 In his complaint, Sharma said Rajiv and his son Yajush, representing Jukaso Education Society, had claimed they owned primary school site number 4 in Sector 56, and gave him a proposal to take over Golden Height School on rent /lease for 75 years. The deal was finalised at Rs 12 crore. In addition, Rs 1 crore was to be paid to the accused as interest-free refundable security, which Sharma paid on October 1, 2016, at the time of finalisation of the deal at Jukaso Hotel in Sector 14, vide DD number 004010 for Rs 40,00,000, DD number 004020 for Rs 35,00,000 and cheque number 342785 dated August 29, 2016 for Rs 25,00,000. The remainder was to be paid in 90 days.
 
 “Rajiv Khanna was to provide documents, including building completion certificate from competent authority (Huda), certificate of affiliation of the higher secondary section from CISCE, clearance certificate of all loan/bank liability/property tax, government dues or other encumbrances, original allotment letter, possession letter and lease deed of Jukaso Education Society. They had shown and supplied copies of the same and undertaken to supply the originals before the deal was completed, saying the originals had been misplaced. As the school was already running on site, Sharma had no reason to doubt the facts and intention of the accused. However, despite repeated requests, the accused did not show the original documents, instead trying to delay. After a while, Rajiv asked Sharma to stop payment of cheque dated July 29, 2016 for Rs 25,00,000, but DDs amounting to Rs 75 lakh had been encashed. Eventually, an exasperated Sharma contacted Huda, where he found the accused was only a leaseholder, who had also used fabricated document to cheat him,” read the victim’s complaint.
 
 “Finally, I approached cops on January 8,” said Sharma. After preliminary probe, EOW recommended lodging FIR, registered against the duo under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for cheating), 471 (used as genuine as fraud) of IPC, at Civil Lines PS. Rajiv Khanna, who runs the Gurgaon unit of club-bar chain Jukaso, was unavailable for comment.
