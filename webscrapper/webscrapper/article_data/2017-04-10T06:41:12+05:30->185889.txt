VIJAYAWADA: It is high time the 2,000-year-old classical dance form -   - got its due recognition from the  , say the exponents of the  . 

 Kala Ratna awardee Sarada Ramakrishna, who has been teaching the dance form for more than 30 years now, talking about the uniqueness of the art, said, "Andhra Natyam is as old as temples in Andhra and Telangana regions, and is believed to have taken birth during the Satavahana era. It is primarily 'Lasya Narthanam' which expresses the content in a feminine fashion." According to Dr Suvarchala Suresh, the only research scholar on Andhra Natyam in the country, now working at the   (UoH), the artistes practising the dance form took a major blow in 1946, with the legislation of the Devadasi Act. 
 
 Most of the dancers then had to shift to other professions and slowly, the dance form reached an near-extinct stage. "It was revived in the 1970s with the intervention of the  , who visited every Andhra Natya dancer in the combined state and learnt the art. He then took it forward through his disciples and his writings," Suvarchala, one of his students, said. However, the situation is not so rosy in the birthplace of Andhra Natyam, AP. 
 
 "It is sad that the region where the Andhra Natyam took birth is slowly forgetting it. We, the Andhra Natyam dancers in AP have been pressing the government to take steps to revive it in the state. While Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam are getting recognition, it is unfair that Andhra Natyam, is losing strength at its very roots," rued Sarada Ramakrishna.
