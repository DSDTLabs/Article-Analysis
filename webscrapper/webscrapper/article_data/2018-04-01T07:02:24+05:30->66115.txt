PATNA: A day after the   (CBSE) announced the  , schools in Patna on Saturday held a mock exercise for online distribution of question papers after a letter received from the   regional office (  and Jharkhand).

 The mock drill was conducted at 100 examination centres across the state under the supervision of the centre superintendents with the help of computer teachers and computer lab staff.
 
 The CBSE regional office alerted the schools on Saturday that its headquarters would send a URL on the registered email or mobile number of the centre superintendents to download the question papers within limited time. According to sources, the CBSE is trying out multiple ways to conduct free and fair examination. “The CBSE will provide question paper on registered email of the centre superintendents half an hour before the commencement of exams,” the source said.
 
 The principal of a city school said, “According to the CBSE directive, we have set up two computers, printers in a room with a CCTV camera installed there. The question paper had to be downloaded by using the password and distributed among students after taking a printout. The entire process had to be done within half an hour before distributing the question papers to the examinees.”
 
 Another school official said, “We have a duplex printer connected to the computer system. We also have fast internet service. We print 150 copies of question paper within a minute. The school has also sent the report to the CBSE regional office about the mock drill.”
 
 School authorities claimed the online process was tested to see whether retest can be conducted through the new mechanism.
 
 However, when the mock drill was conducted, several centre superintendents claimed the system did not work. “No one can guarantee the speed and availability of internet connectivity. Even today, the mock drill was scheduled at 11am, but due to some technical snag, it was rescheduled for 12.30pm,” said another principal.
