 At present there are 11 startups running in the campus on a trial basis and numbers are expected to grow. The pre-incubation centre was inaugurated in February and budding entrepreneurs are being mentored by 11 faculty members.
 
 Professor DL Sunder,  , said, “A good percentage of students have become entrepreneurs and a lot more will take this route down the line.”
 
 The centre has a well-furnished hall to so that 3 to 4 groups can work simultaneously. The institute has earmarked 10 rooms in the campus for entrepreneurs on a selective basis depending on their business ideas and feasibility.
 
 Sunder said that the students are encouraged to run experiments on campuses.
 
 “A few students running startups on a trial basis in the campus are expanding their experiment to other cities,” said Sunder.
 
 The institute also links budding entrepreneurs with industry mentors for knowledge sharing and experiences. IIM offers a compulsory entrepreneurship orientation course of five sessions for all first year students.
 
 Sunder said, “Our idea is to increase awareness of entrepreneurship as a career option. This will not only help in entrepreneurship but in corporate jobs too.”
 
 Sunder said, “It is not compulsory that every student turns out to be an entrepreneur after completing the course, but through experience and opportunity help them do something on their own.”
