SURAT: For the first time, the Diamond City will be witnessing ‘Puzzle Parking’—an automated parking system—for cars near   junction at Nanpura. This type of parking system is designed to utilizes the upper space by stacking cars one above the other. 

 The puzzle parking system is automatic and the desired car can be brought to the lower level without having to move the bottom car. 
 
 Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( ) has urged   (SMC) to allot around 100 square meter of open space on the side of the junction to create the puzzle parking system. 
 
 In just 100 square meter area, the puzzle parking will accommodate around 33 cars. 
 
 Sources said that parking system is most popular in the metros like Mumbai, where the land is limited and demand for parking space is high. 
 
 The puzzle parking is designed using micro processor based logic controller which brings the desired car to the level where it could be driven off without having to manually remove the car from the lower level. This ensures better safety of the car as the keys can be kept with the owner.
 
 Talking to TOI, president of SGCCI, BS Agarwal said, “We have asked for 100 square meter land at Makkai Pool junction. The cost of setting up puzzle parking will be borne by SGCCI. The estimated cost is pegged at Rs 1.25 crore. The SGCCI will be managing the parking system on its own and that the civic body will allot land at a token price.”
 
 Agarwal added, “SGCCI building, located on the main road at Nanpura, has been facing parking issues from last many years. Due to the increase in city’s traffic, there is an urgent need to set up puzzle parking system for both two-wheelers and four-wheelers. Through this system, we will be able to save the precious land, by creating more space for the vehicle parking.”
