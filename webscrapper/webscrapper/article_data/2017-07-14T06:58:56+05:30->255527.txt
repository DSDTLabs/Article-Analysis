BENGALURU: Scores of junior doctors, medicos, NEET candidates and their parents gathered at   on Thursday to draw the government's attention to the plight of   students who are losing over 1,000 MBBS seats to their counterparts from other states due to the skewed seat matrix in private medical colleges.

 The protesters -members of   and Youth Doctors' Association (KMSYDA), NEET candidates and their parents --said opportunities to puruse MBBS were shrinking for medical aspirants from Karnataka.
 
 Dr Bharath Kumar, president, KMSYDA, said, “The Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) has called for applications to MBBS BDS courses from candidates from across the country . This will result in students from Karnataka losing more than 1,000 MBBSBDS seats to students from other states.“
 
 “When these outstation students become eligible for postgraduate courses (MDMS DMMch), local students will once again be the losers. The government should immediately look into this matter and come out with a solution,“ he added.
 
 When states like  , Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and   are asking only local students to apply for MBBSBDS courses, Karnataka too should follow suit, opined the protesters.
 
 Jaspal Singh, father of a NEET candidate, said: “Kannadigas losing medical seats to outstation students will soon create a dearth of doctors in the state, and residents will have to face the crisis.“
 
 “Non-Kannadiga students can apply for seats in the all-India quota, management quota and NRI quota.We request KEA and the state government to allocate all MBBS seats in the state only to students from Karnataka,“ he added.
