HYDERABAD:   acquisition is proving to be a major hurdle in the development of the 300-km   ( ). The chief minister’s pet project will connect several urban centres outside the Outer Ring Road, including Chandrasekhar Rao’s assembly constituency Gajwel, with the capital city.

 As per the preliminary feasibility study, at least 1,800 acres has to be acquired for a 200-feet wide RRR. If the width of the road has to be 300 feet, the land required will go up to 3,000 acres. A majority of this is privately owned. 
 
 The chief minister had asked officials to speed up the preparation of the detailed project report (DPR) to be submitted to the Union roads transport and highways ministry seeking funds for the project. The central government has agreed to provide the funds, provided the state government manages to pool the land required.
 
 Also, the funding will not come in a single tranche. It will be provided in instalments based on the utilisation certificate submitted by the state government on the use of the funds. The funding process is likely to take over two years and the Telangana government is now seeking money needed in this interim period.
 
 Roads and buildings engineer-in-chief, I  , said the project would need between Rs 6,000 crore and Rs 8,000 crore, depending on whether the width of the road is to be 200 feet or 300 feet. The existing road is less than 40 feet wide in several stretches. Moreover, there is no link from one stretch to another at many places.
 
 The chief minister has given two years as the deadline for the project. The official expressed confidence on finishing the work within two years of the commencement of work on the ground. “We are going to submit a detailed plan along with financial estimates to the Union ministry at the earliest,” he said.
