CHENNAI: Usha Subramanian comes from a family that holds high faith in education and strives to raise children who love academics or become academicians themselves. So, when she walked her son Ramnath into the   on his first day at school, her heart broke a little, knowing he wasn't welcome into the system that she had grown up revering. But to this day, she and her husband   - both bankers -are grateful for their prudence in choosing to educate their son all the way through, when they could've easily succumbed to the prophecy of a doctor that he wouldn't live beyond the age of 18.

 Ramnath who celebrated his 21st birthday on Monday says he loves studying as much as he enjoys watching Ajith films. The family saw its years of fighting naysayers pay off for the first time when Ramnath passed his Class X, with 94% and Class XII with 73%. Right from the year he finished Class IX, Usha spent her evenings getting additional notes from his class mates and taught him once again at home.
 
 Now, since he has started college, she has opted for voluntary retirement and spends time taking lessons for him at home, in addition to what he learns from a private educator. “She is equipped to get a degree in   herself,“ jokes Subramanian.
 
 But this success didn't come easy .“The only person to keep our morale high was Ramnath's educator, Shivakumari, who pushed us to enroll him in a special school, at a time when we could've easily lost heart over the rejection we faced from several mainstream schools. This is pretty much the most crucial point for parents,“ says Usha.
 
 “If more parents of Down's syndrome kids ensure that they finish their education, we can ask the government to give them clerical posts, in banks and in railways. But such change begins at home, with unrelenting parents“ says Subramanian.
