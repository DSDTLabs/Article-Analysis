MUMBAI: A mix of chirpy prattle and friendly woofs filled the air at a modest-sized hall in   on Saturday afternoon where a bunch of kids had assembled to learn about behaviour of dogs. 

 The interaction was aimed at improving interaction between humans and dogs besides eliciting compassion towards the canines. The kids were given a slew of pointers about how to assess canine behaviour. 
 
 ‘Dogs speak to us through body language’ was the message passed on by dog behaviourist Rajeshwari   to the tots who were excitedly patting three trained dogs—a Labrador, a   and a Shih Tzu—that strolled into the hall.  , pet parent of the female Beagle named  , said her dog has undergone basic training. “She has been trained on how to behave in a crowd and obeys basic instructions,” said Vira, adding that she even does a little jig when told to “dance”. The project titled ‘Human- Dog Interaction Project’ aims to familiarize people on how dogs communicate and interact. 
 
 
  
 “Dogs don’t bite because they want, they do so because they’re scared. Statistics show that more kids get bitten by pet dogs than by strays. That’s because most kids keep away from strays, but take liberties with pets,” said Ramachandran. Seven-year-old  , a Chembur resident, said, “I don’t have a pet at home. I am a bit scared of dogs. But now, I’ll try to play a little with them.” 
 
 The Bengaluru-based group, which runs the project, also trains dogs to help employees de-stress at workplace, said Ramachandran also an HR professional.
