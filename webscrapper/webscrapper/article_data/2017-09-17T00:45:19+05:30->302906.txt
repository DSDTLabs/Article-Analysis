This was anything but a friendly. Five bookings, flying tackles and doctors from both the team benches running on to the field.
 
  Fortunately, nobody had to be stretchered out, although the India Under-17 team preparing for the Fifa World Cup next month would have been more hurt after losing 0-1 against FC Goa’s developmental side at the Utorda ground on Saturday.
  
  Isaac Negredo headed home the only goal of the match after a barren first session.
  
  Coach Luis Norton de Matos is using these friendlies to test some of the fringe players, seeing for himself how they react in a match situation. He has just another friendly – likely later this week – to decide but would not have been too pleased with what he saw on Saturday.
  
    started promisingly in the opening half an hour and should have gone ahead through Liston Colaco, had it not been for an excellent save from goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Singh Gill. Another chance went missing as Meldon D’Silva headed wide from close range.
  
  India survived those nervy moments and finished the first half stronger of the two. Aniket Jadhav, in particular, was lively and kept the rival defenders on their toes. He tested the goalkeeper too, and even though Komal Thatal also looked in fine fettle, the duo lacked the finishing touch that translates good moves into goals. Thatal, in fact, hit the crossbar.
  
  FC Goa had more experience and composure. The developmental side surged ahead midway into the second session as India defenders fumbled while clearing a corner and Negredo, lurking nearby, made them pay by heading home.
  
  Matos made swift changes to bring the match under control. India pressed hard for the equaliser but despite a flurry of attempts late in the game, they trooped out with little to show.
