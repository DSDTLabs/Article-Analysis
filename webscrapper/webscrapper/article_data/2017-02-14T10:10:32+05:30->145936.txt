AHMEDABAD: Education Multimedia Research Centre ( ) of the   conducted   for six posts on Monday on very short notice. The applications for these posts were invited in 2009. However, they were not processed and interviews were cancelled.

 Later in 2014, the university once again organized and later cancelled the interviews. Interestingly, the candidates were sent call letters only last week, three days before the date of interviews. 
 
 Since interviews were exceptionally delayed, several candidates who were sent call letters did not happen to qualify as they had crossed the specified age-limit.
 
 Since they received the call letters, they appeared for interviews and were informed by the committee on Monday that they did not qualify. However, the candidates questioned the move stating that they should not have been sent call letters at all in that case. Moreover, candidates also questioned the universityâ€™s abrupt way of conducting interviews. Around 70 candidates were invited for interviews for six posts. Sources said that the interview process appeared to be rigged considering the way they were conducted, especially given that the current vice-chancellor is completing his term on February 20.
