New Delhi: The Delhi high court Wednesday castigated   Students Union (DUSU) poll candidates for defacing the national capital, saying they owe an apology to the city.

 It also ordered the DUSU office holders and candidates to place an action plan within a week on how they propose to clean up the defaced areas in DU and the manner in which future elections should be conducted to avoid such damage. “It is not a joke. This is violence against the city and its people. We shall have a clean Diwali. Come back in a week and show us a clean Delhi University,” the bench directed.
 
 It had earlier asked the 23 candidates who had contested the recently held   to appear before it and issued show cause notices to them to explain why action should not be taken against them for defacing public property.
 
 The court had a poser for NSUI candidate Kunal Sehrawat, who is the vice president. “You are a law faculty student and expected to follow law. Is this the leadership you will provide? During elections you all have defaced public properties, used spray paints, defaced metro stations. Who will clean it? The whole university comes to a standstill during elections,” the bench said, indicating that the candidates may have to bear the cost of cleaning all the defaced public properties. Defacement is an offence having a punishment of 10 years in jail.
 
 The court then issued fresh notices to those candidates who have not been served and listed the matter for October 16. Meanwhile, DMRC, in its status report, told the court that stickers and posters were being removed regularly and in case of defacement by spray paint, white wash is being done.   is hearing a PIL by advocate Prashant Manchanda seeking a complete ban on the alleged defacement of public properties by the DUSU poll candidates.
