HYDERABAD: The railways are spending crores on the interlocking of mid-section manned level crossings, but an analysis of railway accidents reveal that most of the victims are mowed down by trains at these crossings in all the 16 zones, including the  .

 The chief commissioner of railway safety   wrote a letter to the chairman of railway board   on December 26, pointing out that the midsection manned level crossings are being interlocked in a ‘haphazard’ manner as part of the railways’ action plan on safety.
 
 “Total 408 accidents took place at the level crossings since 2011-12. Twenty nine accidents have been reported at the manned level crossings and 14 of them happened at the interlocked level crossings. Thus, the interlocking of midsection level crossings does not improve the safety ,” Shailesh Kumar Pathak said. In SCR, most of the trains, including MMTS, on the routes between   and  , and Lingampally and Hyderabad are stuck for long at these faulty gate signals.
 
 The officials of South Central Railway told TOI that the number of signals has gone up in absolute block system after the introduction of interlocking in level crossings. Each block section has around 12 to 16 signals with three or four interlocked level crossings. Hence, the rise in signal density poses as a challenge to train drivers.
 
 “As the drivers don’t have any technological support, interlocked crossings hinder the position of signal passing on danger (SPAD). It also increases challenges to the signal staff posted at these level crossings as over 20% vacancies of signal manager posts are lying vacant,” said Shailesh Kumar Pathak.
 
 Station masters reap benefits of the operational flexibility in interlinked level crossings because they don’t need confirmation about the closure of such crossings before giving lines clear to trains.
