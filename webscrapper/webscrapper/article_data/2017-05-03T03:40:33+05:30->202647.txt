He owns a flat in Sector 3 of Vasundhara. His criminal antecedents are also being verified. So far we have been able to ascertain that he was once jailed in the past in a case of loot. We are trying to find out more details about his properties,” Yadav said.
 
 The other accused in the case, Sanjeev, who was arrested on Monday has been sent to judicial custody by a local court. Cops are yet to examine in detail the postmortem report of the deceased, Aman Singh Dhillon, which arrived on Tuesday. 
 
 However, the police said the autopsy report makes it clear that Aman died of a single gunshot injury on the left side of his chest.
 
 Prince and Sanjeev had fired indiscriminately at the occupants of a Swift VDi car after it grazed their Honda City late on Sunday night.
