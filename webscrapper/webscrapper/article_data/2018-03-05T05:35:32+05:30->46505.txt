GURUGRAM: The  , which is expected to bridge the gap between school and higher education in the city, will start classes this academic session itself, PWD minister   said on Sunday.

 The minister said two colleges under the university will start functioning this year. In April last year, the   cabinet had approved a Bill to set up a state university in Gurugram, which has been a long-standing demand of students of the area, who have to travel either to Delhi or other cities for higher education.
 
 Although Gurugram boasts of some reputed schools, the city lacks higher education facilities. According to sources, an estimated 60,000 girl students alone commute to Delhi from Gurugram for higher studies.
 
 Officials said it would take another four years for the university to become fully functional, and is expected to cost around Rs 700 crore. Rao Narbir announced that Dr Markanday Ahuja, an eminent eye surgeon, has been appointed vice-chancellor of the university. Dr Ahuja had earlier been posted as the VC in Baba Mastnath University in Rohtak.
 
 “Setting up a university is a really big task. But we are committed to building it for our residents. Classes will begin this academic session itself,” Singh said, adding that tenders had been floated for the elevated highway on Gurugram-Sohna road, with that project expected to get completed in 15 months.
