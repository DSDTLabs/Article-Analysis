Ishita is driving and talking on the phone with Aaliya. Aaliya tells her that Roshni has left for Bhalla house. While talking on the phone, Ishita hits a man. She rushes out and checks on him.
 
  The man is a fraud and fakes his accident with blood to make money out of her. Ishita tells him that she is a doctor and will cure him. She gets shocked to see the man's face. He turns out to be the same man whose face Romi and Adi photoshopped as Roshni's husband.
  
  The man tries to escape thinking he will be caught, but Ishita stops him and asks him to come with him.
  
  
 
  
  Shagun on the other hand, gets to know from her NGO about a woman who was forcefully married to a stranger because her groom got killed by electric shock. Shagun takes interest in the case as she thinks Roshni is the same woman. She thinks of personally taking care of this matter.
  
  Ishita takes the man to Bhalla house and starts scolding him. Roshni, Adi and Romi get shocked to see him. The man is all confused as he doesn't understand what is happening. Ishita asks Roshni to teach him a lesson.
  
  Ishita asks Adi to call the police. The man gets scared and changes his statement saying that yes Roshni is his wife and he has realised his mistake.
  
  Romi grabs the person and takes him out of the house. He then threatens him to leave else he will call the police.
  
  Shagun reaches Khandpur village to buy 'kaliren' for Aaliya. She meets Roshi's mother who sells the same.
