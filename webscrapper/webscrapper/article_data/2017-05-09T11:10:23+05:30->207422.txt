CHANDIGARH: Fuelling speculations on her candidature for the   Lok Sabha seat which has fallen vacant after her husband's demise,   Khanna widow of late Bollywood actor and BJP MP   held a prayer meeting in his memory in front of their family home on Shailee Road on Gurdaspur-Pathankot junction on Monday. She was accompanied by son Sakshi and daughter Shraddha. The late actor's brothers   and Vivek were also present. 

 Singer Anup Jalota led the meeting with soulful songs. Union minister of state Mahesh Sharma and Hoshiarpur BJP MP and union minister for social justice   and Akali Dal supremo Sukhbir Singh Badal also attended the prayer meeting.
 
 Kavita who has been a frequent visitor to the family house was however not available for comment. But Khanna's close aide and Osho disciple Swami Tataghat told TOI that she would be the ideal choice to replace the late actor in the by-poll. "The family would want Vinod's legacy to be alive here and the best way to take it forward is to have his wife contest the elections," said Tataghat.
 
 A win for BJP is crucial to build on the momentum post the electoral triumph in UP, especially after the setback in Punjab. While the party won three out of the 23 seats it contested in Punjab, its alliance partner SAD managed to bag 15 out of the 94 seats it had its candidates in. The BJP has always fought the Gurdaspur seat, which has a significant Hindu population, as part of the alliance with the SAD.
