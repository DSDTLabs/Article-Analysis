MUMBAI: The   on Friday lambasted the state government for not revealing the names of 482 persons getting   besides constitutional entities who are entitled to receive it.

 A bench of   and   heard a   by advocate   on non-recovery of dues from persons given police cover. Through an RTI application, he learnt that Mumbai police provides protection to 242 persons, including builders.
 
 The state’s advocate submitted a list of 792 persons given protection in the rest of Maharashtra. The bench was miffed that under a category where protection is given to those entitled to receive it such as judges, ministers and bureaucrats, it mentioned “482 others” but did not elaborate. Justice Chellur asked, “Who are those persons? Why the secrecy?”
 
 The bench questioned why police protection has been given to certain persons for years despite non-payment. Justice Chellur said,“Are they incapable of paying or are you treating them as VIP?” The judges said political parties must be approached to recover dues payable by their functionaries. They also noted that most cover is given to businessmen. “If necessary, you run a separate agency for them. Don’t put general public at stake,” said Justice Chellur.
 
 “You are not running the department for the rich. The police department is for everyone,” said Justice Chellur. The state’s advocate said police for bandobast are taken from reserved police and not local police. The judges made it clear that they are not against police cover being given to persons. “At the same time, there should be no loss to the public exchequer,” said Justice Kulkarni.
 
 The government has been directed to submit at the next hearing “lists for Mumbai and separately for rest of Maharashtra category-wise indicating occupation or position of persons getting protection”.
