Pune: A multi-disciplinary design company from the city was awarded the prestigious Red Dot distinction for designing a range of disposable tableware.

 The firm, Therefore Design, bagged the distinction for fabricating ‘Chuk’ — the disposable tableware. 
 
 Manufactured using bagasse, an agricultural residue of the sugar industry, the product is extremely relevant today given the recent ban on the use of plastics and thermocol.
 
 After a rigorous evaluation process spanning over several days, Chuk was awarded the ‘Red Dot’ distinction. The Red Dot Award has roots dating back as far as 1955.
 
 In 2018, designers and manufacturers from 59 countries submitted more than 6,300 objects to the competition. A jury comprising roughly around 40 members assessed the products individually, including the level of innovation, functionality, formal quality, ergonomics and durability.
