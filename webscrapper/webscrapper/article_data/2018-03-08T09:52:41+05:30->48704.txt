AHMEDABAD: The   181 helpline, run on public-private partnership (PPP) model by the   and   since 2015, has run into trouble over the last month. Sources privy to the development said that the staff of 120 has not been paid one month’s salary and 12 resource vehicles, from the fleet of 48, are off the road.

 According to EMRI records, the helpline handles about 400 calls a day and dispatches vehicles on 60 to 80 calls, for the issues ranging from prevention of child marriage, rehabilitation of women living on the road, domestic violence, sexual abuse and so on.
 
 A staff member, on condition of anonymity, said that they have been paid salaries for the last month. “The vehicles are leased. About 12 vehicles are not being used for cases and we have to get help from other agencies including the police. If this condition continues, it will be difficult to have an on-the-ground presence in Gujarat, perceived to be a safe state for women,” said the staffer.
 
 Sources said that delayed payments have accumulated and the arrears could be running up to Rs 5 crore. While the budget allocation is not an issue, implementation has scope for improvement, they added.
 
 Milind Torawane, secretary in-charge of the Gujarat government’s ministry of women and child development, said that they are aware of the issue and will devise a way to address it.
