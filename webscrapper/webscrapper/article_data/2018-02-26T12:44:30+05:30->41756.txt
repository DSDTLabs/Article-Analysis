HYDERABAD: Over 2,000 cases from   and   are pending with Forensic Science Lab, of which nearly 900 cases are from Hyderabad. "The   has not been bifurcated yet, so the lab is handling both  , leading to more workload. Also, there is acute shortage of staff. The cops are yet to receive reports in around 900 cases," said N  , scientific officer and head of Clues Team. 

 As per FSL norms, the report should be sent within a month, however, the FSL is taking two to three months to send the reports. "The DNA analysis takes nearly two months. However, sometimes police need the reports faster to investigate cases, so the FSL have to prioritise the work accordingly," he said.
 
 For cases under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, FSL takes over 20 days to give results. Venkanna said that 20 days is a long period for the police to dispose off the case. "The clues team head office is equipped to do minimum analysis. Drug samples are quickly checked using Drugs Broad Screening System. Though, we can't provide specific details on how much percentage of which substances is there, but it helps police make arrests in the case," Venkanna added.
