LUCKNOW:   chief   went back to her drawing board to devise her electoral strategy afresh ahead of the UP elections, which will determine her political fortunes.

 BSP sources said Mayawati, camping in Lucknow, is likely to call on all her MPs, MLAs and zonal coordinators for feedback vis-avis the prevailing situation and chalk out a strategy.
 
 The BSP boss is already learnt to have drafted her tentative campaign schedule, which she may discuss with her zonal coordinators and other key officials. BSP insiders said Mayawati believes that the feud between the camps of   and his uncle Shivpal may still be simmering at the grassroots.
 
 “That still gives   a chance to bank on the uncertainty within the SP file and consolidate Muslim votes,” a senior BSP official told TOI.
 
 Mayawati, who has been trying to drive a wedge in the SP family by claiming division of Yadav vote-bank, surprisingly remained silent when the raging feud between Akhilesh and Shivpal reached a flashpoint resulting in expulsion of the former. A senior BSP functionary said it wouldn't have been proper to comment since the issue pertained to the family.
 
 Party sources said Mayawati has asked BSP functionaries to work quietly in their constituencies and focus on consolidation of Dalits and Muslims which together account for more than 40% of the total electorate.
 
 Mayawati has not only asked her Muslim officials to hasten public meetings in Muslim areas but also concentrate on regions which have sizeable population of non-Yadav OBCs, essentially the Most Backward Castes (MBCs). They are a part of the ongoing Bhaichara committee meetings to mobilise voters of the upper castes.
 
 “Zonal coordinators have been asked to bring in MBC cadres and rake up the issue of their being denied enough share in the reservation bracket under the OBC,” said a senior BSP leader.
