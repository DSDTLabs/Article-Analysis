CHANDIGARH: Fraudulent financial institutions in Punjab robbing gullible people on the pretext of multiplying their money manifold may now end up spending up to 10 years in jail and lose their properties. The Punjab cabinet has made   a non-bailable offence.

 In a step to safeguard depositors’ interests, the council of ministers on Thursday approved ‘The Punjab Protection of Interests of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Bill, 2018’. The state government’s move follows after receipt of several fraud complaints from the people, state government agencies, the Reserve Bank of India and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
 
 As per the new legislation, if a finance company fails to return the deposits on due date or indulges in fraud, company’s promoters, managers and employees would be liable for imprisonment up to 10 years and fine of Rs 1 lakh. The financial establishment will also have to pay a fine ranging between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 1 crore.
 
 Once the new legislation comes into force, all financial establishments would have to submit quarterly business return to the district magistrate or additional district magistrate. In case the company fails to comply with the law, it would be liable to pay fine of Rs1 lakh.
 
 As per section 3 of the legislation, the government can attach properties of the company, its owners, directors and promoters. Sections 16 of the bill states no anticipatory bail would be allowed to promoters, managers and employees of the fraudulent financial institutions.
 
 The   would help in keeping a check on mushrooming financial establishments making unlawful gains by way of receiving money as deposits from public by making commercially non-viable promises.
