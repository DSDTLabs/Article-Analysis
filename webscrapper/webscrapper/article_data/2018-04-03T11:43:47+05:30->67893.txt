MANGALURU:   in the district are having a harrowing time following the government’s decision to mandate identity cards for  .

 A new rule by the government, which is in place since March 1, has made it mandatory for a pregnant woman to furnish any of her identity cards such as  , PAN, driving licence, ration card or Thayi card to undergo scanning. However, only a few women are aware of the rule and most of them are seen going back home without being scanned.
 
 Lack of awareness in the district has hit rural women harder. Women from as far as Belthangady, some 60km from here, too, are being sent home for not being able to produce any proof to ascertain their identity. Since most of the sophisticated scanning centres are located in and around  , the women from distant parts are feeling the heat.
 
 Dr Ramakrishna  , district health and family welfare officer, agreed that the lack of awareness has being causing problems, especially to rural pregnant women. “In the last month, we have been apprised of cases where women were caught unawares of the rule. These are initial hiccups. Awareness is now being built,” he said.
 
 An employee at a scanning centre in the city said they are required to upload the scan details online, and hence, customers are required to furnish identity cards. “Uploading the documents is mandatory to avail various benefits such as Janani Suraksha Yojana and a host of other facilities by the state and the central governments,” he said.
 
 However, those not willing to avail any government benefits, too, are required to furnish identity card. “We need an identity for customary scans so we can document the number of women scanned, the reason for scanning, the location they underwent scanning and so on. Hence, it becomes necessary that all pregnant women furnish their identity cards,” Dr Rao said.
