Gurgaon: Two property broker-brothers, both residents of Kendriya Vihar in Sector 56, were allegedly thrashed by   of the housing society’s security staff during an argument over car parking on Wednesday evening. The two were badly injured and are being treated at a private hospital.

 Police have booked four bouncers for the assault and arrested one of them, the security supervisor.
 
 According to cops, Ankur Sharma and Pankaj Sharma reached home from work around 7.30 pm on Wednesday and parked their car in an open area near their allotted parking space, which was occupied by a neighbour. 
 
 Soon two bouncers came and asked the brothers to remove their car from the open area. Ankur and Pankaj tried to reason with them, but it soon led to an argument and two more bouncers were called in. “The four bouncers suddenly attacked us. They beat us with sticks and also kicked and slapped us many a time,” Pankaj told TOI.
 
 The two were immediately rushed to a private hospital.
 
 “The society has arranged security for protecting the residents from goons, but the bouncers are thrashing the residents. I have sustained a fracture on my left leg and my brother was also seriously injured. We want strict action against the accused bouncers,” Pankaj said.
 
 Cops said they rushed to the society immediately after getting information about the brawl, but on arrival they found that three of the accused bouncers had fled.
 
 On the basis of Pankaj’s complaint, an FIR has been lodged against the four bouncers, including security supervisor Ranjit Singh and Krishan Kumar, under sections 323 (causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC at Sector 56 police station.
 
 “We have arrested the supervisor and are questioning him. We are conducting raids to nab the other accused,” said Charan Singh, the investigating officer.
