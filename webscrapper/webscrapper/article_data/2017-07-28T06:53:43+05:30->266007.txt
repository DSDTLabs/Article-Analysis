BENGALURU: Indian private equity bellwether   has sold entire 13.5% stake in product engineering and IT consulting firm   for $55 million, or Rs 350 crore. ChrysCapital offloaded shares to mutual funds and HNIs through block deals in recent weeks, exiting its bets on the Pune-based company.

 The share sale by ChrysCapital also puts to rest recent speculation about a large new investor entering KPIT, a mid-sized IT services business focused on sectors such as automobile and manufacturing, or the company figuring in an industry consolidation deal. 
 
 Last year, the company had worked with investment bank   to bring in a new investor, raising as much as $150 million, which had drawn the attention of investors like  .
 
 ChrysCapital has booked a profit in selling the stake, but not as stellar as its past exits from Infosys, HCL Technologies, Mphasis and Hexaware. According to past media reports, the fund had invested slightly over Rs 210 crore to build up the stake in the mid-tier IT services company, which was earlier called   Cummins. When contacted, ChrysCapital declined to comment.
 
 However, the share sale helped ChrysCapital to close its $900-million fifth and penultimate fund with an overall twofold return. Last month, the fund exited   for well over $200 million through an IPO, netting a sevenfold gain.
