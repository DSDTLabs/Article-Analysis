SHIMLA: With   elections due next year, the   is going to launch an electoral  , Hisaab De Saansad-Jawaab De Saansad, in which it is going to ask all four BJP MPs in the state about the work they have done since they were elected in 2014. 

 Congress state president Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said here on Monday that 13 senior leaders of the party would question the MPs from February 15 to 17. In the 2014 parliamentary polls, the party had lost from all four Lok Sabha seats in the state. “In 2014, Prime Minister   made tall promises, like expanding rail network, increasing import duty on apple, and taking steps to boost tourism,” he said.
 
 He said BJP MPs were elected on the basis of promises made by Modi. “Now, time has come when MPs will have to tell us what they have done for the state in last four years and how many poll promises have been fulfilled,” he said.
 
 Sukhu said not a single promise made by Modi had been fulfilled. In response to the Congress’s move to launch the campaign, Hamirpur MP Anurag Thakur said the Congress was in power in the state for five years, but it could not start the   Park project it had promised for Hamirpur or establish its other poll promise of setting up a medical college in teh district. “I started the process to connect Hamirpur with a rail line and the survey of Hamirpur-Una rail line has already been completed in record time. Now, work is in progress regarding geological mapping and final location survey,” he said.
