 and Anika reach a garden. While Shivaay is apprehensive about the place and feels it could be dangerous, Anika is ecstatic and begins to have fruits from a nearby tree. She gives them to Shivaay also. Both of them get intoxicated and start laughing. 
 
 They find a home which Shivaay calls Taj Mahal and begin to look around for keys. Shivaay finds them under the door mat. Anika begins to suspect if he has come there before. They enter the house and Anika throws the keys outside. They get locked in the room. 
  
 Since they are intoxicated, they have fun dancing and listening to songs on radio. Soon enough both of them doze off. They miss the important announcement about two thieves who have escaped the jail. 
 
  
  
 When they wake up the next morning, Anika tries to shoo away a bee from Shivaay's face. They get into a funny argument. Shivaay tells Anika he doesn't know for how many days they'd be stuck there as they don't have the keys. 
  
 When Anika compares their situation to Aamir and Juhi's in 'Qayamat se Qayamat Tak', Shivaay tells her it is real life. Anika tells Shivaay he has punctured the romance in the situation. And Shivaay begins to tease her for the same. 
  
 Just then two men come and claim the place as their guest house. Shivaay explains their situation and requests them to arrange for transport. They leave. Pinky tries to reach Shivaay but in vain.
