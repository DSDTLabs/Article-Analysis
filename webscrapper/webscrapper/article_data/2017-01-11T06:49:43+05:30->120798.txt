AHMEDABAD: Greatness being tuned to its finest voice — rasikas witnessed that on Saptak Day 9, Monday. Sarod titan   needed adjustments to the electronic tanpura, and   legend Pandit Rajan Mishra helped. Sitting on the stage’s edge, Panditji worked the knobs till the sound accorded with the cadence of purity valued by both.

  Khan-sahab began by building a grand curvature of notes that enveloped all in warmth and consolation. Aspiring rasikas were stirred by a familiar rhythm. Khan-sahab was playing Khamaaj, the raga on which “Vaishnava jana toh” is based. For aficionados, Khan-sahab’s exposition had a savant’s power to find meaning hidden by enchantments. That power comes from Khan-sahab’s technical mastery, which is as infallible as a yogi’s capacity to control thoughts. These gifts have been honoured by the world. “The first encouragement I received came in the form of the Sarod Samrat title, given by the reputed Prayag Sangit Samiti, Allahabad,” Khan-sahab told TOI. “I was 15 or 16 then.”
 
 Khan-sahab holds people’s affection as his most cherished award. Therefore, he generously shares programme notes for lay listeners’ benefit. “Khamaaj was followed by a composition in Telang and taraana,” he told TOI. “Then I played Atal Ranjini, a new raga I have dedicated to former PM  .” The baithak concluded with Rabindranath Tagore’s “Ekla chalo re” and an Assamese folk tune.
 
 The new raga shows that Khan-sahab’s innovativeness is stoked by pristine classical intuitions. His sons,   and Ayaan Ali Bangash, closed their own recital on Monday by conquering the mighty Malkauns. Connoisseurs noted that their flaming panache and command of the classical cannon made them the ideal heralds of their father.
