PANAJI: Alleging that the ruling BJP-led coalition government was out to defraud farmers and individuals whose land has been acquired for the under-construction international airport at Mopa, the state   on Monday demanded that the Goa government pay the people Rs 6,000 per sq m for the acquired land.

 Addressing reporters,   president   said that the administrative decision taken by the   government to give “three times the primary compensation” should be increased to four times the market value of the land.
 
 “Although approximately 98 lakh sq m of the Mopa land was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, that is before the Right to Fair (Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement) Act, 2013, came into force, the principles mentioned in the 2013 Act should be adopted in the Mopa land acquisition matter,” Naik said.
