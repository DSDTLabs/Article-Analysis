HYDERABAD: Traffic was thrown out of gear on routes leading to Tank Bund, on Saturday, in view of the massive traffic and security restrictions imposed by the city police for seventh anniversary of the 'Million March' planned by  . 

 While the police eventually denied permission for the march, citing law and order issues, the traffic restrictions imposed 11am onwards left office-goers struggling to reach their destinations. The diversions around Tank Bund were in place till 5pm.
 
  
  
 
 As many commuters were unaware of the diversions, situation at various junctions was chaotic with police seen re-routing people to other roads. "I regularly take the Tank Bund road to reach my workplace. Since I was unaware of the traffic restriction, it took me an additional 30 minutes to cover the distance," said  , a commuter.
 
 According to traffic cops, the vehicular movement at Kavadiguda, Marriott Hotel, DBR Mills, Lower Tank Bund, Katta Maisamma junction was slow due to traffic diversion at Tank Bund. The situation was much the same along the   and Domalguda roads during morning hours. 
 
 The traffic diversion also affected the peripheral areas of Tank Bund with slow vehicular movement observed at Yashoda Hospital, Somajiguda towards   (Rajiv Gandhi Statue) on Saturday afternoon. The scene at Telugu Talli flyover was chaotic with many commuters forced to take alternate routes. "The Telugu Talli flyover is the shortest route to reach Domalguda and RTC crossroads. But the traffic at the flyover was choc-a-block, making it extremely difficult to inch forward," said Mohammed Afzal, a commuter.
 
 Police was deployed in large numbers across the city, especially at junctions such as Khairtabad, Lakdi-ka-pul, Necklace road, Somajiguda, Basheerbagh among several other areas. The traffic snarls only improved after the restrictions were lifted.
