RANGA (Gopikandar, Dumka): Unlike previous elections, electorates of Ranga, the native village of deceased former   MLA  , came forward to vent their ire against the JMM by extending their support to the   in the   on Sunday.

 “Why should we support the JMM when Anil’s widow was denied a party ticket to represent us,” 40-year-old Tipu Marandi said, after casting his vote earlier during the day.
 
 Similar sentiments prevailing among a considerable section of the electorates at Ranga, which consists of roughly 150-odd families, was reflected here when locals waved saffron flags even outside the late MLA’s residence. 
 
 Uniki Udora Hansda, Murmu’s first wife who was aspiring to carry forward the political legacy of her late husband, was denied a JMM ticket; her nomination as an independent candidate was also rejected due on technical grounds.
 
 “The JMM leadership, including party supremo Shibu Soren and Hemant Soren, continued assuring Uniki of a party ticket to contest the byelection but finally refused her one by handing over the same to Simon Marandi,” Kinu Hasda, one of the closest aides of the deceased MLA said, adding that he along with majority of Murmu’s supporters will ‘teach JMM a lesson’ by supporting BJP candidate Hemlal Murmu.
