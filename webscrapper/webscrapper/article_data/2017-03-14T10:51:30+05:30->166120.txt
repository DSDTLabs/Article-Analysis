VISAKHAPATNAM: The   authorities have decided to redesign the campus and make it friendly for the  . Vice-chancellor Prof   has promised that the works will begin once the examinations are over and be completed before the next academic year.

 Speaking to TOI, Prof Rao said AU is one of those institutions that was built at a time when the notion of being friendly to disable people did not exist. “Most of the structures were built either during the colonial period or in the decades immediately after. However, we have decided to construct ramps in all the major buildings wherever we can and provide wheel-chair services,” he added.
 
 University registrar   said civil engineering experts have offered certain ideas with the help of which most of the old buildings can be turned into friendly buildings for the challenged. “Our aim should be to make every student feel welcomed in the university. For this we need to add the human touch as well,” he added.
 
 The university authorities said certain experts have been consulted regarding the cost of the project and added that it would be done at the minimum price. They have also decided to rope in organisations such as We The Able who have been working for the benefit of the disable people to generate awareness on this issue
