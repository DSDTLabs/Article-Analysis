New Delhi: Following the release of the rankings of higher educational institutions on Monday, union   minister said that the assessment will be linked to higher funding and  . He said that the rankings alone would not serve the ultimate purpose of bringing in qualitative improvement in higher education. This required, he said, incentives to make the institutions competitive enough to remain on the highest rung or to break into the top  .

 The ministry set up the National Institutional Ranking Framework in 2015 and issued the first rank list in 2016. “The rankings are now a competition for continuous improvement of quality among the institutions,” said Javadekar. Stating that there are “benefits” attached to the rankings, the minister said, “We will support, give more funds and grants, enhanced autonomy and other benefits to the ranked institutions.” He said that policy amendments in this regard would be announced soon.
 
 In 2014, the ministry had linked funding by the University Grants Commission to the accreditation process carried out by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council ( ).
 
 Javadekar had a sarcastic aside about some institutions caught in controversy recently. He said the recognition accorded to universities such as Jawaharlal Nehru University and   was purely for their research and quality work and “not for their ‘pro-Afzal Guru’ slogans or for keeping their vice-chancellor under siege”. JNU was ranked second among universities, while Jadavpur University was in the fifth position.
