Mohali: A devotee at a gurdwara allegedly attacked three others with a ‘khanda’ (a double-edged sword) in Phase VIII on Sunday evening. One of the victims’ right forearm was cut. The other two suffered minor injuries.

 The accused, Balwinder Singh, was arrested on charges of attempt to murder, said Phase VIII station house officer sub-inspector Rajiv Kumar.
 
 The victims are Manjit Singh Bhatia, 60, Bhupinder Singh, and Joginder Singh, all residents of Phase VII in Mohali. Manjit Singh suffered a fracture and a cut on his right forearm.
 
 Rajiv Kumar said all the four had come to pay obeisance at the gurdwara near YPS Mohali and were having tea at a roadside vendor outside the gurdwara when Balwinder also came there. Police said Manjit during conversation with Balwinder urged him to get involved in ‘kar sewa’ (selfless service) at gurdwara instead of other activities.
 
 Balwinder Singh felt offended and allegedly attacked Manjit with the ‘khanda’ he was carrying with him. When Bhupinder and Joginder tried to save Manjit, he attacked them too, police said.
 
 Balwinder has been booked under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal code (IPC) at Phase VII police station. He will be produced in the court on Monday, said SHO Rajiv Kumar.
