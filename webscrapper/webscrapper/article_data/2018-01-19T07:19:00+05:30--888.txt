Gurgaon: Panic gripped residents of Mamlika village in Mewat after a 10-foot-long Indian   was found in the village. The male python, according to a wildlife official, weighs around 20kg, and is nearly three to four years old. 

 The villagers informed the wildlife department and a team from the department immediately reached the spot. “A crowd gathered after the python was spotted in the village. One of the villagers helped in keeping the people away from the serpent. We called up the wildlife department. A team from the department rescued it,” said Mohammad, a resident of the village.
 
 According to wildlife inspector Sunil Kumar, who was part of the rescue operation, the python might have come from the Aravalis. “Rock pythons are found in this area. The serpent might have come from the Aravalis. After observation, it was found to be healthy, so the python was released in its habitat near the village,” he said.
 
 As many as 10 pythons were rescued in and around the city in the past 14 months while only four pythons were rescued in 2016.
 
 The rock python is non-venomous and it can be easily identified by its large size, dark irregular patches, pink-ish head and slow locomotion. 
 
 This year, pythons have been rescued from Patuadi, Sohna, Ghata, Baliyawas, Faridabad, Raisina village and Ghamroj. Indian Rock Python is threatened by habitat loss and poaching and has been listed in the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
