GOLD COAST: If the Phogat sisters are a famous story in Indian wrestling, the Yadav sisters from Varanasi could soon stake the same claim in weightlifting. On Sunday, Punam, the fourth among seven siblings and the second of three weightlifting sisters from ancient city, was climbing to the top of the podium in women's 69 kg here. In doing so, she was helping India win it's fifth gold in lifting at the Games here. Later, adding to that medal haul was   in men's 94kg class.

 
 
 
 
 "The competition was very tough and I had a strong fight with Australia's   and   of Fiji.
 
 The Fiji girl had won the gold in the 2017 Commonwealth meet here where I was second," Yadav told TOI.
 
 Punam who took the bronze in Glasgow four years ago, hoisted a total of 100kg in snatch and 122kg in clean and jerk for a winning haul of 222kg. England's   took silver in 217 (95+122) and Vaivai the bronze in 216 (100+116).
 
 
 
 
 The Fiji girl had also lifted 100 in snatch but she failed with 122 on the bar on her third lift. Training under Vijay Sharma for the last four years, Punam improved her Glasgow total by 22 kg. Asked about gunning for  's record [snatch (110kg) and total (240kgs)] set at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Punam admitted that it was a long way off.
 
 "Those are tough to beat. I was eying the clean and jerk record but today I couldn't lift what I used to do in training," the 22-year-old admitted.
 
 Punam belongs to a family of lifters.
 
 Elder sister Sasi was a state-level competitor who guided Punam to the top. "It was 'didi who took me to the sports hostel in 2010 and from there my career began," Punam told TOI.
 
 "My younger sister Pooja is also a weightlifter and she is the junior national champion in 63kg. Together the three of us have won more than a dozen national medals," the   gold medallist said, adding, "We are five sisters in all, and our two younger brothers are also interested to get into sports."
