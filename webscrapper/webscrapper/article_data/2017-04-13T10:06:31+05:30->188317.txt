COIMBATORE: In what would come as a relief for the   from   along the   to  , the   has acquired a "people and luggage transporter or trolley". The trolley can be borrowed from the station master's room on platforms one and two. While usage of the trolley is free, commuters have to pay the porters who wheel them. 

 "The trolley was given to us to experiment it on a trial basis by engineer Ram Ganeshan who designed it," said a senior Salem division official. "He has given it to us free of cost," he said. 
 
 Ganeshan, a retired engineer, said he has trained the porters in the station on how to use the trolley and wheel it. "So once the elderly climb the flight of stairs and reach the platform, they can immediately request a porter to get a trolley for them. The porter can seat them and place their luggage on the trolley," said Ganeshan. 
 
 "I have requested that only porters be allowed to borrow and wheel the trolley and not passengers," he said. "While passengers do not have to pay for usage of the trolley, they do have to pay the porter for wheeling them," he added.
 
 The Coimbatore Junction, one of the top ranked A1 stations in the country, has always failed to make it to the top 10 position because of its lack of accessibility. All its six platforms have to be reached by climbing a flight of stairs, because the escalators and elevators are usually switched off. Elevators are also not accessible to all forms of disability. 
 
 The Salem division has now decided to fix new elevators to all the six platforms. "Being a senior citizen myself, I have struggled climbing up the stairs and walk on the platform to reach a specific coach," said Ganeshan. 
 
 "I will definitely ask my daughters to get me a trolley next time," said an excited regular train commuter, Shanthamani Y.
