BENGALURU: In a strong rebuttal to Prime Minister Narendra  , who recently questioned the state of Bengaluru’s infrastructure,   president   on Wednesday said that doubting the state capital’s development is an insult to the city and its maker Kempegowda.

 
 “Bengaluru is the pride of India and it developed as the IT capital much before Modi became the PM. The city was not created by his three-minute magic. To ask questions about Bengaluru’s development is to insult Kempegowda who built the city. It is an insult your forefathers (of Bengalureans) who toiled for the development of the city over the years,” Rahul said at a streetside meeting at   in Shivajinagar. He said Bengaluru was generating Rs 3 lakh crore revenue through IT exports and the city became the startup hub without any help from the Modi government at the Centre.
