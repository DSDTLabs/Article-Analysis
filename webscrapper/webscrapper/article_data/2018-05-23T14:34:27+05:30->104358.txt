RAJKOT: Police constable  , who was arrested on Monday for allegedly assaulting cricketer Ravindra Jadeja’s wife Rivaba in Jamnagar, was suspended on Tuesday and a departmental inquiry has been instituted against him. He was released on bail later on Tuesday by a court.

 
 
 Rivaba arrived at her maternal home in Rajkot on Tuesday morning with her mother Prafullaba, still in shock from Monday’s assault by a cop following a collision between her car and a motorbike on Saru Section Road of Jamnagar city. She was driving an SUV with her 11-month-old daughter and mother Prafullaba when her car collided with the motorbike of Karangia on Monday evening.
 
 Jamnagar superintendent of police   on Tuesday said that Karangia has been suspended from duty. “It was a condemnable offence and we have zero tolerance towards this kind of behaviour. A departmental inquiry has been initiated and he might face dismissal if the inquiry indicts him of the offence,” said Sejul. When asked if there was any sexual assault on Rivaba, Sejul said, “There is no specific complaint alleging sexual assault. But as per the law, when any woman is attacked, we impose IPC Section 354.”
 
 Speaking to media persons, Rivaba’s mother Prafullaba, who was with her at the time of the incident and lodged the complaint with Jamnagar B-Division police station, said that Rivaba was still in shock. “The way the constable (Karangia) pulled her hair and banged her head on the car, I swear, I have only seen such behaviour in movies.”
 
 “I was unable to help because the baby was in my arms. But local people helped us in nabbing the constable,” she added. Prafullaba said that she got a call from state home ministry assuring strict action against the accused. She also appreciated cooperation by the Jamnagar police department.
