PATNA: Even after three days of his order to probe into the controversy over former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin’s photographs with tonsured head and trimmed beard and moustache, which went viral on social media, IG (Prison)   is waiting for the report from Siwan district and jail administration on the issue.

 Shahabuddin’s recent photographs were allegedly taken inside the Siwan jail where he is lodged. Following media reports, Kishor, on January 8, had ordered Siwan district magistrate   to inquire into the matter and send him a detailed report at the earliest on the photographs and if they were taken inside the jail. When asked, Kishor said the report was expected to reach him within a couple of days after which the course of action would be decided. He said the DM has constituted a team which is looking into the controversy.
 
 “I have asked the DM to also inform about the present appearance of Shahabuddin inside Siwan district jail,” Kishor said on Wednesday.
 
 Kishor said he would comment only after receiving the report from the district administration. The IG also denied the allegations that the jail administration was working under the Siwan strongman’s pressure.
 
 Meanwhile,   sources from Delhi said they have sent a questionnaire to jail administration on the meeting between Shahabuddin and state minority welfare minister Abdul Ghafoor on the jail premises in March 2016. “The questionnaire was handed over to the jail administration during the course of the ongoing CBI investigation into senior journalist   murder case,” sources said, adding that jail administration has replied on the issue. However, CBI sources refused to reveal any details of the questionnaire and the reply they have received.
