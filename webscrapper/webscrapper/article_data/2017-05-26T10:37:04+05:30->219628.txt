MANALI: Military convoy, local residents and tourists will have to wait for one more week for opening of strategically important Manali-Leh highway as snow clearance is taking time near 16,050ft high Baralacha Pass, 191km from here.

  (BRO) had set a target to open this highway till May 25, but many spells of fresh snowfall, deep snow deposits and damaged road delayed the opening date. Snow has been cleared from 252-km   which is maintained by project Himank of BRO. 222km   highway is maintained under project Deepak of BRO. The officials said they need at least one more week to link the road from Manali to Sarchu.
 
 BRO officer commandant Lieutenant Colonel Vijay Kumar said 192.5 km road from Manali towards Sarchu has been cleared and now they have about 30 km stretch to clear. “We have moved beyond mighty Baralacha Pass. We have now dealt with all difficulties. We hope to reach Keling Sarai in a day or two. Snow will be cleared till Sarchu within a week. We then need two-three more days for minor maintenance before allowing vehicular traffic on this road,” he said.
 
  and Baralacha Passes are the main challenges before BRO. The jawans have moved 1km ahead of Baralacha. “Baralacha has 10 to 20 feet high snow. The remaining stretch till Sarchu is covered under four to five feet of snow. We can now move ahead with a constant speed. We shall allow traffic on Manali-Leh highway in first week of June,” Kumar added.
 
 Manali-Leh highway was officially closed on October 15. Summer snow clearance on the highway had started in March. Thousands of tourists are desperately waiting for opening of this highway. Many tourists who had planned to go to Leh by road from Manali in May end had to cancel or postpone their trip. Soon after opening of the highway, military convoy will start supplying essential commodities to the border areas via this route.
