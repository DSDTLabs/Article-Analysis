PATNA: Former   (JNU) professor Anand   on Wednesday called for drastic reforms in the election and party system in the country.

 Delivering a lecture on ‘Cultural pluralism, social cohesion and development’ to mark the 60th foundation day of A   (ANSISS), the sociologist urged people to “aim for harmonious and sustainable development through cultural pluralism and social cohesion”.
 
 While cultural pluralism occurs when smaller groups maintain their unique cultural identities within a larger society, social cohesion is the willingness of the members of a society to cooperate with each other in order to survive together and prosper.
 
 Talking about the connection between religious harmony and communal strife, Kumar said, “Both Ashoka and Akbar represented cultural pluralism and religious harmony.   and  , on the other hand, were infamous for their religious intolerance and cultural discriminations. The Britishers were also blamed for adopting the policy of divide and rule and conspiring with communal forces for the partition of India.”
 
 India’s civilizational journey has been complex with several twists and turns. Recalling novelist V S Naipaul’s notion of post-independent India, Kumar highlighted three important phases between 1947 and 1990. “The country looked like ‘an area of darkness’ in the first decade after independence and like ‘a wounded civilization’ in the mid-70s or during the Emergency period. During the 90s, there was an atmosphere of ‘million mutinies’,” he said.
 
 Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, state education minister  , ANSISS director   and registrar  , among others, also attended the lecture.
