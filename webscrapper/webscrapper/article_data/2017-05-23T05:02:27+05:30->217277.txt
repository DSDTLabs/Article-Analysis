MUMBAI: The state   (ATS) has initiated a probe to ascertain if   (33), an Indian detained by Pakistan, is the suspect who had allegedly joined   (LeT) in 2006.

 ATS sources said after seeing his photograph in Pakistani media, it appeared he was the same person, who along with LeT suspect,  , crossed over to Pakistan via Jammu & Kashmir in 2006. “There are reports that Imran was injured in firing and Ahmed sneaked into Pakistan. There is no official communication to the Indian government but we have assigned few officers to gather more information,” said an ATS official.
 
 Police said Ahmed’s family had not heard from him since then. 
 
 ATS officials visited Jogeshwari, where he stayed, on Monday. Sharukh Shaikh a local resident, said he used to do zari work around 10 years ago. “I have not seen him since then,” he said. Another resident said, “The family shifted to Jogeshwari (E) in 2008. We remember police frequently visiting his home, asking about Ahmed. His parents used to tell us Ahmed was in Dubai.” Ahmed’s family subsequently shifted to Jogeshwari (W). 
 
 In 2006, after the ATS arrest of an accused in the Aurangabad arms haul case, information obtained by agencies showed that several youths were joining “anti-national forces”. Ahmed’s name had cropped up during the ATS probe then. ATS had seized 30 kg RDX packed in the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer, 10 AK-47 assault rifles and 3,200 bullets. ATS had said 22 accused had procured the arms and ammunition to allegedly target political leaders accused in the 2002 Gujarat riots case.
 
 An ATS official said Pakistan may be using him to get at India over the execution of another Indian, Kulbhushan Jadhav.
