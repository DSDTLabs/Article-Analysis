MANGALURU: The coming together of various   speaking communities during the three-day Konkani Lokostav-2017, which kickstarted on Friday, struck an emotional chord with city’s top cop – a native of Andhra Pradesh.

 Chandra M Sekhar, city police commissioner, said, “Konkani speaking people from different religions and from five states - Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat, have gelled together for a joyful celebration is a matter of great pride. If our people (Telugites) take 10% of your spirit, we can live in unity and peace,” he said, pointing out at the violent protest that took place to divide the state into two, not so long ago.
 
 “Though all Telugites follow traditional customs since past 2,500 years, now they have been divided in two states,” he said.
 
 Observing that a majority of Konkani speaking people have a pleasant personality, Sekhar said he had been witness to the calm nature of Konkanis that rubbed off on others who wanted an altercation. “It is a great quality. In spite of provocation, Konkani speaking people maintain their calm. I do not know how they manage it, maybe it’s in their culture or language. Another best quality I have seen in the Konkanis is that they are highly enterprising. They give their best whatever task it may be. They do not quarrel for petty reasons. Only with such qualities, people can come up in life. Whichever community works hard and maintains such qualities will prosper,” he said, adding that visit of Konkani activist Basti Vaman Shenoy to police office calms the tense atmosphere.
 
 Mayor Harinath, who spoke in Konkani, said that India has unity in diversity and the Konkani speaking people have contributed much to the country. “There is a local saying that ‘If people from the Konkani community plant a sapling at any place, it will bear fruit’, such is their enterprising nature,” he added.
