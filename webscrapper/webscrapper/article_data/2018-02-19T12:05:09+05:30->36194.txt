MARGAO: The   village panchayat constituted it’s mandatory garbage management committee during the gram sabha on Sunday.

 Nuvem deputy sarpanch   said gram sabha members refused to approve the audit report as a part of the funds provided by the Directorate of Science and Technology were not utilised by the previous panchayat body for the purpose they were granted. It was decided that the remaining money would be used to construct bio-toilets for poor villagers. Some members drew our attention to a case pending in this regard before the director of panchayats.”
 
 “Files related to projects like providing pure drinking water to villagers and construction of drains and roads will be kept at the panchayat office for three weeks and villagers are requested to submit their suggestions or objections to these proposals. Nuvem zilla parishad member   was also present for the meeting that was attended by all the panch members,” said Borges.
