THANE: After days of scorching heat, Thaneites got some respite from the heat as the   levels dipped by 5-6 degrees in the mid-week.

 From a maximum   of 44 degree Celsius, the temperatures dropped to 39.1 degrees on Thursday due to the change in the direction of the winds. Meteorologists predict that although the temperatures would be hovering around 36 degree Celsius from the next 24 hours, it would still be three degrees above the normal levels.
 
 The weathermen asserted that the relief from the heat would be short-term, as the skies will be clear and temperatures are likely to soar slightly once again in coming week.
 
 Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at skymet   said, “Because of the easterly winds that come from Telangana, the temperatures in Thane and its neighbouring areas were in the range of 40 degrees. Since the past two days, the winds changed its directions. So, the Konkan belt which include Thane was getting cooler winds from the Arabian sea. Now, it is again likely that the winds will be changing its course, giving rise to higher temperatures. At the same time, the weather won’t be that hot as it was earlier this week.” To brace themselves for the upcoming rise in the mercury levels, Thaneites are seeking alternatives and bringing about some changes in their daily routine.
 
 “Though, we live near to the foothills of the green Yeoor forest area, the heat is unbearable. Hot winds blow inside the house when we open the windows. As we don’t have an air-condition, I have begun sleeping on the other side of the bed directly under the fan. In the afternoons, we have to shut the windows and the curtains, switch the fan on full speed and wait till it stopped circulating hot air. We have also started drinking water from silverware to avail of the naturally cool water, “said Arya Ganesh, a resident of   road No 1.
