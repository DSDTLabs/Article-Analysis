PATNA: IG (Patna zone) Naiyyar Hasnain Khan has ordered departmental proceedings against inspector Sanjeev Shekhar Jha for giving a fake FIR number to one the house of Murari Kumar Srivastava in a burglary case.

 Jha was posted as Pataliputra Colony police station   when thieves broke into Murari’s house at Nehru Nagar and decamped with valuables and jewellery worth several lakhs. Srivastava came to know about the theft on his return from a 10-day trip to Shirdi on February 20. Murari lodged an FIR with the Pataliputra police the same day and received a copy from Jha bearing number 59/17. When Murari inquired about his case after more than three months, it surfaced that the FIR number given to him by Jha was fake. 
 
 Meanwhile, Srivastava, an employee of Power Grid Corporation of India, kept running from pillar to post and ultimately met the IG, who ordered DSP (law and order) Shibli Nomani to investigate the matter and submit a report on the issue. An original FIR (178/17) was lodged on June 6. No one has been arrested yet in the case.
 
 “The DSP, in his investigation report submitted on Tuesday has found complete negligence on the part of Jha,” the IG said, adding that another FIR was lodged on the number given by Jha to Murari.
 
 Even before the matter surfaced, the IG had suspended Jha on May 18 and ordered departmental proceedings against him for delay in lodging an FIR in a child’s sexual exploitation case in which his mother was kept running from pillar to post. Jha, even after the court orders, had not lodged the FIR for 36 days. The FIR was later lodged with Jakkanpur police station.
 
 “Now with the current case, strict action will be taken against Jha for brining disrepute to the police department,” the IG said. He, however, denied that an FIR was also lodged against Jha for forgery in the FIR, which is also a government record.
