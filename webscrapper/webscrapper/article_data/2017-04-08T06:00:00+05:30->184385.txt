The satire poetry meet,   held at   on Tuesday evening turned out to be a laugh riot. Six poets, from different parts of the country —   (MP),   (Chhattisgarh),   (Bhopal), and Hyderabadis  , Raghvandra and Sushma Singh — tickled the audience with their 
witty shayari on issues like note ban, farmer’s deaths and unemployment.
 
 Anil Trivedi in his poem, Kisano ki Soch, spoke on how the farmers are suffering in silence due to famines, while Rajesh recited a humourous couplet that depicted the anguish of the youth, as interviews have become a mockery these days. Sushma Sigh, in her satire depicted how even Vishnu was affected by note ban in the heaven as goddess Lakshmi left him in search of a rich husband in earth, as the Lord turned into a pauper overnight.
 
 Akhilesh, gave a vivid and heart touching reflection of corruption and how the youth are forced to take up arms. The event aimed at sensitising people about the burning issues of the day, using the medium of poetry, said Praveen Kumar Singh, the organiser.
