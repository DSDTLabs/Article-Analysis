MUMBAI: A 47-year-old man from Jaipur, who is believed to be the mastermind behind a racket to defraud a company, was arrested by the   cell on Friday. 

 The accused, Samarsingh Revari, is accused of forging signatures of the company’s directors and submitting bogus ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) details in a bid to change the company’s address and mobile number of authorized signatories in the bank’s records. Revari wanted to gain access to Saf Yeast Company Pvt Ltd’s bank account, which had a balance of Rs 27 crore. 
 
  
 Revari is the fourth person to be arrested in the case, so far one Rajendra Khempal Singh from UP, Anand Pandey and his son Kumar Pandey from Bihar have been taken into custody. “Revari used a forged cheque to transfer Rs 20 lakh from the company’s account to two other accounts. This happened immediately after the KYC papers for change of cellphone numbers and address were submitted, hence it raised suspicions,” said a   officer. The bank’s staffers got in touch with the company’s officials. 
 
  “With the cellphone service provider’s help, we traced the number submitted in the papers. It belonged to Revari after which we picked him up,” said a senior police officer. “We are interrogating Revari to ascertain from where he procured the company’s registration documents, which he had submitted in the bank,” said a police officer. Revari’s advocate Ajay Dubey said, “Someone put my client’s number in the KYC form.”
