JAIPUR: The   ( ) enforcement team that had gone to take action against the illegally constructed buildings on Monday returned empty-handed. 

 Recently, JDA had launched a drive against building owners who illegally carried out construction after their buildings were sealed.

 As per the schedule, the team had to reach around 10 am. But, the drive started at 4.30 pm. As the house owner produced the stay copy received from the court, drive had to be called off. 
 
 “The stay is effective till May. JDA had to demolish the fourth floor and setback of the building, which were illegally constructed,” said the source. 
 
 When questioned, why JDA carried out the drive when the court has stayed the demolition, official said that, “the owner was verbally telling us that there is a court stay. However, he did not show the copy of orders. Once our team reached to demolish the illegal construction, the owner produced the copy of stay.” 
 
 Similarly, the drive in   on plot no. C-9 where the owner has constructed a penthouse illegally on the building was stopped after a crack emerged. The team was to drill the roof of the illegally constructed penthouse with drill machine.
 
 The drive on this building was also started late. “The drive was halted as cracks developed and it was risky for other residents staying in the same building. Now, the drive would be resumed under the experts’ supervision so that other parts are not damaged,” said a zone official.
