MUMBAI: Thousands of commuters were inconvenienced on Sunday as the eight-hour traffic block by Central Railway (CR) between   of foot over-bridge (FOB) girders at   extended by 30 minutes. 

  As crowds increased at Dadar, railway police got into action and monitored commuter movement on platform 1. 
 
  While the army launched the girder at Currey Road, the railways launched nine girders in a row at Parel, said sources. More than 200 people were involved in the launching of the girders at both sites. After the Elphinstone Road FOB stampede on September 29, which had claimed 23 lives, the army was roped in to build FOBs at Elphinstone Road-Parel, Currey Road and Ambivli. 
 
  The three FOBs built by the army, said sources, are expected to be operational by February-end, while the railway is building another FOB at Parel, which is expected to be completed by March 31. "Passengers should bear with us as the FOBs will benefit them in the long run," a CR official said. 
 
 A senior railway official said due to the traffic and power block on the CR main line, commuters were allowed to travel via Harbour route between Kurla and CSMT. "We also ran the regular (daily weekday) timetable so that more services were operated on Harbour line on Sunday," he said.
 
 But for those who opted to travel by road, it was not a pleasant experience due to overcharging by some cabbies and surge pricing by aggregator cabs. The BEST operated 16 additional services, four from Colaba and six each from Backbay and   depots which ran full. 
 
 During the Sunday traffic blocks, six outstation trains on Central Railway were cancelled, eight rescheduled and four regulated, inconviencing long-distance passengers too. 
 
  services were also delayed by up to 30 minutes owing to a megablock between Goregaon and Andheri stations. 
 
 There was some reprieve for Harbour line commuters as there was no megablock on Sunday.
