AMRITSAR: Amritsar police on Thursday cracked the murder mystery of a woman and her daughter following the arrest of two youths, one of whom is a friend of the deceased’s son living in Canada.

 Amritsar commissioner of police S S Srivastava said police had arrested Pankaj (20) and Neeraj (18), both residents of Chhehrata, for allegedly burning   (41) and her daughter Shivnaini (21) to death at their house in   locality here on February 5 night.
 
 Pankaj is a friend of Gagan’s son, who is pursuing studies in Canada, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP)   said. “Pankaj earlier worked in a cloth shop but was currently jobless and in dire need of money. He connived with his friend Neeraj to extort money from Gagan. Since Pankaj knew Gagan and had been to her house earlier, she didn’t suspect them when they came to their residence on that fateful day. The accused were carrying chloroform,” he said.
 
 During investigations, Pankaj revealed that they had first made Gagan unconscious by giving her a high dose of chloroform and tried to rape her. When he noticed that she wasn’t responding or breathing, they wrapped her body in a blanket and went upstairs to where her daughter Shivnaini was watching TV, the officer said.
 
 The accused told Shivnaini that her mother was making tea. “When she got up to go downstairs, they pushed her on to the bed and gave her also a high dose of chloroform, leaving her unconscious,” said ADCP Lakhbir.
 
 “Pankaj tried to rape her too. But realising that she was also not moving or breathing, he called Neeraj to the room and they decided to set both of them on fire. To confirm that Shivnaini had died, the accused strangulated her with a dupatta,” said the ADCP.
 
 Police have recovered a motorcycle, a camera and a tablet from the possession of the accused.
