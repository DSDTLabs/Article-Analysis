UDHAGAMANDALAM: Thousands of tourists, who had   in advance for a memorable   heritage train ride, have been left disappointed over the cancellation of the service for the past six days. Many of them were informed about the cancellation only after they reached Mettupalayam and some, a day before the scheduled journey.

 NMR journey has always been on the top of the list of tourists to the Nilgiris. For the past five years, after booking has been made online for NMR, the trip is always booked in advance for three coaches out of the four. Tickets across the counter are issued for only one coach, say, for around 75 tickets.
 
 “We booked our tickets in advance for a journey between Mettupalayam and Ooty a month ago. As our friends had told us that the mountain train journey is a very different experience, we were eagerly looking forward to it,” said L Krishnan, a tourist from Chennai. “But to our dismay, we came to know last night that the train service has been suspended for Friday due to track maintenance. It is unfortunate,” he told TOI.
 
 He had a tough time after reaching Mettupalayam, Krishnan said. “As we had luggage, we couldn’t take a bus. We ended up paying a hefty sum to a cab driver to reach Ooty,” he said.
 
 L Sureshkumar from Trichy also narrated a similar story. However, he has no intention to abandon a long-cherished dream. “We are planning to take a short trip by train between Ooty and Coonoor on Saturday,” he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, an official with the   said they are concerned about the safety of the passengers. “Cancellation of train service due to rain, landslip and tree fall are common in NMR section,” the official told TOI.
