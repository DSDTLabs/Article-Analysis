GURUGRAM: The unseasonal rain, while giving the city a respite from the heat, brought another bonus - bringing down pollution levels in the city. 

 For the first time this year, PM2.5 was recorded within the national safe standard (60 micrograms per cubic metre). While experts thanked the rain for clearing dust pollution,   (HSPCB) lauded its efforts to implement norms at the three underpass construction sites on the national highway.
 
 According to data, the highest level of PM2.5 was recorded at 57.84 micrograms per cubic metre on Wednesday, while it was 58.95 micrograms per cubic metre on Thursday.
 
 However, the air quality index (AQI) was reported at 105 on Thursday, while it was 110 on Wednesday - both considered 'moderate' which can cause breathing discomfort to people with asthma and lung diseases.
 
 "It is very rare to see PM2.5 within the national standards. I think the major factor was rain on Wednesday. Rain helps in clearing the sky, which ultimately leads to dispersal of particulate matter in the lower atmosphere," said  , a former member of the   ( ). 
 
 Met department also held responsible rain and sudden increase in wind speed for dispersal of particulate matter. 
 
 "Wind speed was nearly 0.78 metre per second on Sunday and it increased to 1.22 metre per second Tuesday onwards. Rain also helps in clearing the sky," said an official from the Met department.
 
 An official of HSPCB, on the other hand, said several measures have been taken by the authorities to prevent dust pollution at the construction sites of the three underpasses.
 
 "The authorities have taken all the required measures such as vacuum cleaning, installation of sprinklers and grass carpets on footpaths to bring down dust pollution in the city. We are glad that the required steps have been taken," said the official.
