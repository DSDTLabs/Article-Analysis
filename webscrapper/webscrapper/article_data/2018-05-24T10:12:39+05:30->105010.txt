 Sources said Singh was into farming when a relative approached him with the offer of a job of cook in Pakistan. He then worked as a domestic help from mid-2015 to September 2017 at the residence of an Indian defence attaché in Pakistan. 
 
 Singh then came in contact with ISI, which offered him money against classified information from the diplomat’s house. The source said that Singh shared a diary and some documents of the diplomat with the ISI.
 
 Anand Kumar, additional director general (law and order), told TOI: “He had bugged the residence of an Indian defence attaché in connivance with Pakistan’s ISI. This compromised the position of the diplomat. Singh later returned to India in 2017 where he settled his debts to the tune of Rs 8 lakh. As of now it is not clear how much money he had received from the ISI.”
