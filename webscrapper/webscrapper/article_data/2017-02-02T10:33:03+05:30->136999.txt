Social activist   slammed Union budget for ignoring  . She claimed that at first glance, it looks like that the government has increased 25% allocation for NREGA in the budget but in reality, it is just 1% over previous year.

 “At first glance, it would seem as if the finance minister's announcement of an allocation of Rs 48,000 crore for MGNREGA is a dramatic increase of nearly 25% over last year's allocation of Rs 38,500 crore. In fact, the increase is a mere 1%, of Rs 500 crore, as two supplementary allocations during the course of the year made the total budget of 2016-17 Rs 47,500 crore,“ said Roy of   (MKSS).
 
 She pointed that regard less of the budget, for MGNREGA to work as legislation, it needs to have adequate resources to be made available for work to be provided on demand. According to MKSS 22 out of 34 states have negative balances.
 
 “As per the ministry's own data, a total of Rs 3,469 crore in pending liabilities have already piled up even as they have spent 93% of the funds available for this financial year. This is likely to dramatically go up over the next two months as traditionally demand for work has peaked during this season,“ noted MKSS in its statement.
