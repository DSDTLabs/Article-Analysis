KANNUR: Police have registered cases against six women employees -- including at least three nuns â€“ of the orphanage run by a congregation under the church in   and   at Koothuparamba here in connection with the rape of a minor girl, allegedly by a Christian priest, at Neendunoki near Kottiyoor in the district.

 Police said the cases had been registered against hospital staff for not informing authorities when the girl gave birth to a boy there and the orphanage staff for their failure to inform authorities when the newborn was illegally shifted there. "As per the information we got, most people involved in efforts to hush up the case are women, involving a few nuns, and we will be arresting them soon as their roles have been clearly established," a police officer said.
 
 Fr Robin Vadakkancheril alias Mathew Vadakkancheril (48) -- who was the parish vicar at St Sebastian Church, Neendunoki near Kottiyoor -- was arrested from Chalakkudy, while trying to flee to Canada, on February 27 evening. He has reportedly confessed that he abused the girl on the church premises in May last.
 
 The priest -- suspended from his post following an uproar -- is in judicial remand at special sub jail here. Iritty DSP Prajesh Thottathil, who is supervising the investigation, said police would conduct a DNA test to prove the case scientifically.
