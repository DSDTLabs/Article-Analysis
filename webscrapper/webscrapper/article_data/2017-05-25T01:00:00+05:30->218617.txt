 Iyer, who played a small role in Kavalai Vendam, will next be seen in Gautham Karthik’s  . She plays the role of Karthik’s sister in the film. The movie also has   playing the lead actress. 

 Talking about her role, Upasana says, “I play an emotional person in the movie. It was quite difficult for me to play the part as it was not the real me. I am a very bubbly girl in real life, unlike my character in the film. In fact, I have a lot of scenes in the movie where I have to cry. The director insisted that I should get into the skin of the character and play the part. So, I was not even allowed to use glycerine while enacting an emotional scene. This is a crucial role and I have no experience in playing such a prominent character. So, I spent a lot of time rehearsing for my scenes ahead of my shoots. It actually helped to perform well on the set.”
 
 However, Upasana is not looking to make movies a full-time affair. She says, “Acting is not my full-time profession. As I liked the script, I agreed to work on it. I will choose my next film only when I really like the story.”
