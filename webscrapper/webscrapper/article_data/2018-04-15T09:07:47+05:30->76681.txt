HYDERABAD: More than 500 residents of Nallagandla and surrounding areas participated in a cleaning drive along with   workers and members of the   (SPF), at  , on Saturday morning. 

 The drive drew scores of residents from apartments located in the vicinity - Aparna Cyberzon, Aparna Sarovar Grandem Ramky One Cosmos and Hima Sai Lake View - along with volunteers from Art Of Living (AOL) group. Serilingampally MLA Arekapudi Gandhi, Serilingampally corporator R Nagendar Yada and Hafeezpet corporator Pujitha Jagdheeshwar Gaud also participated in the event.
 
 Although the state government has already allocated more than 28 crore towards the beautification and cleaning of the Nallagandla Lake, it continues to be polluted and has shrunk significantly over time, said residents of the area. "The aim behind the cleaning drive was to create more awareness about lake protection and the condition of the Nallagandla Lake among residents of the area. A lot of waste from the high-rise apartments in Nallagandla and surrounding areas find its way into the lake. Plastic waste was also found dumped in the lake. We are planning to conduct similar cleaning drives every two or three months. Once this lake is beautified, it can be developed into a recreational spot as well," said Hirdesh Gupta, president of Ramky One Cosmos Owners' welfare association. 
 
 While garbage that was dumped on the lake bed was removed in bags, boats were used to remove hyacinth and garbage from the water. A similar drive was carried out in Nallagandla Cheruvu in April 2016.
 
 According to lake conservation expert Subba Rao, the Nallagandla Lake was formed due to water outflow from two other water bodies -   and Peacock Lake - located in the University of Hyderabad. Over a period of time, because of the boom in the number of high-rise apartments springing up around the lake, the natural flow into the lake has started vanishing, said experts.
