PALANPUR: The Banaskantha superintendent of police (SP) on Friday transferred three cops and ordered an inquiry into allegation against them that they had   a 40-year-old woman when she was in their custody in Bhabhar police station about two months ago.

 “I have ordered an inquiry into the allegation made by the woman and also transferred the three cops — sub-inspector   and constables   and   of Bhabhar police station,” Banaskantha SP   said. 
 
 The action against the cops was taken following the Gujarat high court order.
 
 According to case details, the 40-year-old had approached Bhabhar police some two months back for lodging a complaint against her husband and in-laws alleging mental and physical torture. However, the police refused to record her complaint and made her sit in the police station till late in the evening. She alleged that while in police station, the three cops assaulted and molested her. 
 
 When the local police refused to lodge her complaint against the cops, she approached the HC that ordered Banaskantha SP to take action against the accused cops. On Thursday, the woman called upon the Banaskantha SP with copy of HC’s order, after which the action against the cops was initiated.
 
 One of the accused cops Jaswant Chaudhary, however, refused the allegation. “Two months ago the woman had come to me for registering a complaint against her in-laws and husband. We told her we will entertain the complaint after preliminary inquiry.” 
 
 Refuting the allegation of thrashing and molestation, Jaswant said, “We have cameras set up at all important places in the police station. One can examine the footage for satisfaction. The woman’s allegations are baseless.”
 
 While Jaswant was asked to go on leave transfer leave,   and Soma, who were attached to the Bhabhar police station, were transferred to the district police headquarters on Friday evening.
