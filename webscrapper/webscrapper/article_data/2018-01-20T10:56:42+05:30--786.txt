TRICHY: Extending solidarity with a girl student allegedly   by a staff member of an aided arts and science college, a group of students boycotted classes and trooped to the collector’s office to file a petition seeking action against the accused on Friday.

 The victim, a final year student of the college in the city , said a management staff member abused and threatened her with dire consequence when she questioned him after she was awarded poor internal marks. Nearly 100 students from Urumu Dhanalakshmi College (UDC) met the collector before handing over the petition seeking action against an officer.
 
 Filing the complaint, the students told the collector that issues within the chemistry department had affected regular classes. Many students were similarly victimised whenever they raised their voice against the poor-performing teachers.
 
 “I had approached the principal complaining of poor teaching by a faculty member. But, instead of taking our complaint seriously, I was silenced by awarding poor grades in the internal test,” she said. The situation is so bad that the career of many students is hanging in the balance. A majority of the students in the final year might not get their degree certificates thanks to their poor grades, she added.
