CHENNAI: The Madras   on Friday censured the   department for failing to protect, preserve and maintain  .

 “If the idols are kept locked up without any maintenance, what is the purpose of having such a department,” Justice R Mahadevan asked, adding that the situation is the same in the 1,700 temples that he had visited in the state. The criticism by the judge pertained to the theft of several ancient idols from the state’s temples.
 
 The court made the observation after IG  , chief of idol wing, informed the court that most of the antique idols were not properly maintained by the department.
 
 The judge then directed the additional advocate-general Aravindh Pandian, the commissioner of HR&CE and IG Pon Manickavel to sit and finalise the steps to implement various guidelines issued by the court in connection with the preservation and maintenance of idols.
 
 In a recent hearing, pulling up the Tamil Nadu government for failing to cooperate in investigations connected to idol thefts, the court warned that it would be compelled to order a   probe into the cases, if such attitude of the authorities continued.
 
 The observations were made on two separate pleas moved by R Venkataraman and advocate Elephant G Rajendran seeking transfer of investigation on all the pending cases of idol thefts to the CB-CID.
 
 In July, 2017 the court overruled the transfer of Pon Manickavel out of the idol wing police and directed the officer to head the wing again. The court further ordered transfer of all the cases pending in various courts across the state, prosecuted by the Idol wing, to the file of the additional chief judicial magistrate, Kumbakonam, for speedy disposal on a day-to-day basis.
