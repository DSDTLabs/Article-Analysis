KOLKATA: The first Chinese minister on a diplomatic mission to arrive in India after the resolution of the   impasse reached Kolkata on Tuesday.

 The visit of the Organisation Department head of Yunnan Province and central committee member of the   (CPC), Li Xiaosan, was part of the relationship-building process that was "being strategically started from Bengal because of its proximity to the Yunnan Province", the Chinese consulate here said. The minister will leave for Delhi on Thursday morning with political meetings on his agenda.
 
 The Organisation Department is one of the key departments in the CPC because it's in charge of appointing officials and also conducts their assessments. "Bengal has been identified as an educational and cultural hub of the country and hence we are looking to improve ties through education in this zone," said Chinese consul general Ma Zhanwu. Among the Bengal-based institutions with which exchange programmes have been planned are,   and Visva Bharati University."This is the first ever visit of a Chinese minister to India after the Donglang (Doklam) impasse, which we have overcome now," Zhanwu added.
 
 Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, is only two hours away from Kolkata by flight and the Modi government had earlier announced that Kunming and Kolkata can be two major links in the two countries' bilateral relations.The fact that Bengal is geographically close to Doklam might also be an indicator that China is now keen to promote peace in the region.
 
 Li has arrived with a retinue of senior faculty and administrative officers from colleges and universities of the Yunnan province to meet their counterparts of VBU and JU on Wednesday. He may speak on why education and cultural exchange can be the key to better relationship between the two countries.Apart from the two universities and the School of Chinese Languages, Wednesday's meeting will see the participation of officials from education department, Calcutta University, Rabindra Bharati University and the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries.
