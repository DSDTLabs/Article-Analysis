PANCHKULA: The residents of Sector 20 here continue to wait for smooth traffic and an underpass that Union minister for roads   promised them a year ago.

 The underpasses is a long-pending demand, since traffic jams have become a routine on National Highway-22 that separates Sectors 20 and 21, and police deployment at traffic lights hasn’t helped. S K Jain, president joint action committee, Sector 20, Panchkula, said: “We are happy that the announcement was made by the ministry keeping in view the demands of the residents, but they have to start the work at the earliest so that the residents get the benefit of this project. We have been asking for the underpass since the flyover was constructed, as there are a large number of housing societies in this area and this is the only entry and exit to   and Chandigarh for their residents.”
 
 Ashok Bali, a resident of Sector 20, Panchkula, said: “The announcement was much-awaited. With the construction of an underpass, we will have no need to stand at the traffic lights for a long time.”  , another resident of Sector 20, said: “The worst affected are those who live near the traffic lights. For them, it is struggle to get home during rush hour, as they have to beat a long queue of vehicles that block the road to their societies. After the announcement of an underpass was made, we were hopeful that the authorities concerned will commence the work soon for the convenience of the residents, but all in vain.”
 
 In the dock
