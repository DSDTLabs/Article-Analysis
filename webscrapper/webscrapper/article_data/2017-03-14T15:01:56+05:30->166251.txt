CHENNAI: Flaying former chief minister O   for the “hitches” in the special  ,   food minister R Kamaraj on Tuesday said efforts have been taken to procure dal and palm oil for supply at   outlets.

 The minister’s response comes a day after the opposition DMK held a state-wide protests against the state’s indifference to PDS. 
 
 The minister said a meeting led by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami sanctioned procurement of special PDS commodities on March 2. Orders issued for procurement of 20,000 MT of dal and 15,000MT (1.5 crore litres of palm oil) under the scheme. The commodities were being sent to the outlets for supply to family cardholders, he said.
 
 At a specially convened press meet at AIADMK headquarters, the minister sought to clarify the reason for the disruption in special PDS. The scheme demands extension for every six months. 
 
 “When the last scheme expired in December, Panneerselvam, who succeeded former chief minister Jayalalithaa after her demise, did not extend it,” the minister said. He said he had not raised the issue earlier “to maintain decorum.”
 
 Kamaraj said a meeting was held under the leadership of Panneerselvam on January 2, in which he and cooperative minister Sellur Raju, chief secretary and senior bureaucrats took part to extend the scheme. “But OPS did not extend the scheme keeping something in mind. I repeatedly met and requested him, but he did not give a concrete reply. Panneerselvam’s ulterior motive is the sole reason for the disruption in the scheme,” the minister said.
 
 While the previous Congress-led UPA regime withdrew subsidy to special PDS in June 2012, the state bears the additional expenditure of Rs 1,800 crore to ensure unhindered supply of dal and palm oil.
