NASHIK: All rescued birds and animals will now have to be handed over to the   for immediate care and  .

 Until now, NGOs and activists rescued wildlife and reported it to the forest department. 
 
 Now, the forest department has said that all rescued wildlife will be kept in the premises of the forest conservator’s office for further action and treatment, if needed.
 
 This practice has been introduced to put an end to the fighting between animal lovers, illegal practices of keeping rescued animals in one’s possession and chances of malpractices. From now on, the forest department will keep vigil by providing a separate space for the animals.
 
 “NGOs, activists, environmentalists and animal lovers come to us with so many injured, birds, animals and reptiles. They have lot of infighting as well. They keep the animals with them until they are treated and released. It is wrong to keep a wild animal in one’s custody. The forest department does not have place to keep the rescued animals, so the animal lovers keep them after informing us. But now we have planned to keep the animals at the campus of the chief conservator of forests (CCF),” said deputy conservator of forest, Nashik East Beula Ezhil Mathi. 
 
 She said that the CCF campus now has space to accommodate rescued animals. 
 
 “After rescuing an animal, the activists will have to bring them here. They can come to the campus and take care of the animal. Once the animal is healthy enough, we will release it. As per the Wildlife Protection Act, it is illegal to keep a wild animal in one’s possession, so we have to take precautionary measures,,” said Mathi.
