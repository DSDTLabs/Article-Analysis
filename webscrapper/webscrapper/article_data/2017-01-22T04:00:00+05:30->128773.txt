Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has issued notices to 11 complexes in different areas of the city asking them to ensure that their parking spaces are free of any encroachments and are used only for parking. The civic body has also warned management of other buildings in the city that it will be taking strict action to free parking spaces in the coming days.

 VMC officials said that the notices were issued after a survey of these buildings revealed that the parking spaces were encroached. The buildings include those in the Alkapuri, Akota, Racecourse, Waghodiya Road, Nizampura and Gotri Road areas. Those issued notices include a newly constructed hotel and a prominent restaurant.
 
 Officials added that the complexes would also be asked to ensure that material or garbage was not dumped in their basements. They pointed out that while there was no encroachment in some basements, they were badly maintained and could not be used for parking.
