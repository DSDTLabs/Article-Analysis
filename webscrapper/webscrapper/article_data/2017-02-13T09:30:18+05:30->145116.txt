HYDERABAD: A Swift car, reportedly driven by a woman, crashed into a compound wall of a residential building at Marredpally near St John's Rotary on Sardar Patel Road early on Sunday. Marredpally police, however, did not register any case and by the time they reached the accident site, the vehicle had vanished. It was a rental car from zoomcar.com.

 Around 3 am, the red Maruti Swift sporting a Karnataka registration number swerved and climbed on the footpath at high speed and rammed the compound wall of the house near the rotary. Eight feet of the compound wall collapsed in the impact. Immediately after the accident, the occupants -two women and a man -jumped off the car and fled.   bought from Anu Wines on Road No. 2, Banjara Hills, and a cake were found in the car, hinting at drink-&-dine party inside the speeding vehicle.
 
 The house, though a residential property, is being used as a godown by a prominent textile brand. The building has a private security guard, but he did not alert police. In the morning, a reliever, who came to re place the night watchman, came to know about the mishap, but he too did not call police. Local media personnel, however, rushed to the spot around 7.30 am and clicked photos.
 
 After the accident was aired by television channels, police came to know about the development and the Gopalpuram and Marredpally police were passing the buck, citing jurisdiction issues. The road comes under Gopalpuram police limits, while the footpath and the buildings along the road are ironically in Marredpally police turf. By the time the Marredpally police personnel rushed to the site, the Swift car was towed away with the help of a crane. When contacted,   C Umamaheshwar Rao said since owners of the building had not come forward to lodge a complaint, they too were not interested in registering a case. “We do not have details about the case as none came forward to lodge a complaint,“ was the shocking response of the inspector.
