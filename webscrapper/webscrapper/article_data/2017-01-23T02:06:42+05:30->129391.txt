CHENNAI: While protesters have so far kept a disciplined approach to the pro-jallikattu movement, some   fans of the sport seemed to have got carried away.

 Some youngsters carrying pro-jallikattu posters are out on roads on two-wheelers doing wheelies and other stunts. The youths, mostly raucous and helmetless, are seen riding in small groups with scant regard for  . They resort to jumping signals and rash-driving. Some minor accidents involving these reckless riders were reported in the city on Wednesday. 
 
 Adding to this was the absence of traffic police on many city roads. Lack of enforcement may lead to accidents, warn senior citizens who report instances of hooliganism on bikes. 
 
 On Sunday, Julien, a resident of Perungalathur said when he was on his way to Adyar, he saw several youths riding toward Marina, throwing caution to the wind. In some of the bikes more than two people were seen riding. Generally, a team of police officials checks vehicles, especially two-wheelers, on Thoraippakkam–Pallavaram radial road. But, in the last few days, no cop was found at this point, he said.
 
 Similarly, there were other signals left unmanned at several points through the week, leading to more instances of hooliganism and traffic chaos, which sometimes extends into the wee hours of the night. 
 
 “I saw young boys on bikes performing wheelies and stunts on the road, disturbing residents in the middle of the night,” complained a resident of MRC Nagar. 
 
 Kelambakkam resident Hari Saravanan said only last week he was caught by traffic police at the   junction for not wearing helmet. Now, in the last one week there is no police at the same spot, where he was caught, he says.
 
 Traffic officials contacted by TOI refused to comment.
