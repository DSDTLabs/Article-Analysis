CHANDIGARH:   chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday appointed former MLA

  Sidhu, wife of cabinet minister  , as director and chairperson of the Punjab Warehousing Corporation.
 
 The move has come at a time when three   MLAs have quit party posts after heartburns over cabinet expansion and several other s are waiting to be appointed to boards and corporations.
 
 The chief minister handed the appointment letter to   at his official residence this evening, an official statement said.
 
 The appointment of Navjot Kaur Sidhu, who was accompanied by her husband, local government minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and rural development minister  , will be effective from her date of joining, as per the notification issued in this regard.
 
 Navjot Kaur Sidhu, the then BJP leader, represented the Amritsar-East constituency in the previous SADBJP regime.
 
 However, as the Sidhu couple switched over from the BJP to join the Congress shortly before the 2017 Punjab Assembly polls, Navjot Kaur had to opt out of the race for contesting owing to ‘one-family-one-ticket’ norm, which was strictly enforced by the Congress in Punjab in the previous polls.
 
 Navjot Singh Sidhu had contested from the Amritsar-East Assembly seat and won.
