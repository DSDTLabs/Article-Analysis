Panaji: Former   Nirmala Sawant and four times Carambolim sarpanch   are among the probables for the Congress ticket in Cumbharjua constituency after party MLA   quit to join the   (BJP).

 Sources said Valladares’ name was among the first probables considered for shortlisting for the Congress tickets after speculation about Madkaikar quitting the party gained steam.
 
 As a local Congressman, Valladares had supported Madkaikar in the past elections and both were on good terms. But with the political landscape changing with Madkaikar’s exit, Valladares may cross swords with if he is given the nod by the Congress for the party ticket.
 
 Valadares and Madkaikar started their political careers in contrasting fashion. Madkaikar, then a small time businessman in Carambolim, unsessfully contested panchayat polls in the past. He later succeeded in the zilla panchayat (ZP) polls and his upward mobility was not far off when, in 2002, he contested from Cumbharjua and won on   (MGP) ticket.
 
 Later, the politician, with a stake in real estate in Old Goa, joined the Congress and was re-elected in 2007 and 2012, besides a bye-election in 2005.
 
 Valadares has been a part of village level panchayat politics for two-and-half decades. In his fifth term now, he continues to be a panchayat member. His young daughter, Wanisha, meanwhile, is about to complete a full term as sarpanch. But Valadares lost in the ZP poll and speculations of him contesting at a higher level later faded.
 
 If Sawant bags the ticket for Cumbarjua, she will challenge her arch rival Madkaikar once again.
 
 A meeting of the Congress high command is scheduled to be held in Delhi on January 10 to finalize the list of Congress candidates and decide the issue of alliance with other parties.
