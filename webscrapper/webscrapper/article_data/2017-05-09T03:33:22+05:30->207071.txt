New Delhi: The wait for cheaper airfares from Delhi is proving to be an unending one. 

 That matter of tariff revision, which was due to be resolved on May 13, will now be heard in July by the  .
 
 SC had asked  , which collects 96% higher charges than the prescribed limit, to end the legal-tussle by May 13. However, the airport appellate tribunal has expressed its inability do so.
 
 The tribunal in its May 2 order had said, “We express the inability to decide all the afore-noted appeals… relating to the fixation of tariff for the first control period, by May 13, 2017.” The reasons cited include one of the tribunal members (Justice V K Jain) ending on May 14, and May 13 and 14 being holidays.
 
  (AERA) in December 2015 had slashed Delhi airport charges by 96% for April 1, 2014, to March 31, 2019 (second control period).
 
 While this should have meant a sharp dip in airline charges, and subsequently lower fares, DIAL continues to charge tariff that AERA had approved for April 1, 2009, to March 31, 2014 (first control period).
 
 AERA in its petition to the tribunal said, “Under the second tariff order, the target revenue to be recovered by DIAL is Rs 7,709.61 crore (approximately) and the aeronautical tariff has been fixed on that basis. However, from April 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016, DIAL has already earned Rs 7,257.15 crore (approx), which is about 94.13% of the target revenue for the second control period.”
 
 “By the end of the second control period, there will be a collection of Rs 17,157.15 crore (approx) as against the target of Rs 7,709.61 crore,” AERA petition said. The regulatory agency had warned that it will be impossible to get this excess amount refunded to passengers, thereby creating an “irreversible and uncontrollable situation”.
