CHANDIGARH: The state government has collected Rs 14.98 crore by way of   cess, which was imposed during the previous SAD-BJP regime in 2016, to take care of stray   through 512 cattle shelters in the state.

 
  
 
 As per information procured under Right to Information (RTI) Act by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira, key cities in the state — including Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Patiala, Moga, Mohali, Hoshiarpur and Pathankot — collected Rs 14.54 crore as the cess. These cities have a total of 25 cow shelters.
 
 Other cities like Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Bathinda and Ferozepur collected a total amount of Rs 44.11 lakh as cow cess for 168 cow shelters.
 
 Till January 23, Rs 14.98 crore had been collected as cow cess, said the reply to his RTI application.
 
 Data available with the Punjab Gau Sewa (cow welfare) Commission claims that 3.8 lakh   were being looked after in the 512 gaushalas. Still, there are over 1 lakh cattle roaming the streets in the state.
 
 In a letter to local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, Khaira said that after analyzing the whole data received through RTI, it had come out that the money collected from the tax payers was not being utilized properly. “Hundreds of people die due to the accidents on roads every day and reason behind most of these is the stray cattle roaming on the roads,” he claimed.
 
 The cess was Rs 10 on each bottle of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and Rs 5 on each bottle of beer and country liquor.
 
 The cow cess was first levied in Bathinda in 2009 on experimental basis, while it was imposed in Mohali three months before it was extended to other corporations in May, 2016.
 
 As per rough estimates, more than 1,000 people are killed each year on the roads of Punjab due to accidents because of stray cows.
