Nagpur: The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) issued another notice to private operator   a week ago, who has let out space where restaurants are functioning at Telangkhedi lake. A senior NIT official told TOI that it is the “responsibility of the operator to vacate the area and give possession back to NIT.”

 The NIT had issued four notices to the operator since November 2016. Sell Ads had expressed its inability to do it.
 
 Shailen Mehta, from Sell Ads, said NIT is the authority to remove encroachments. “Restaurants owners are not abiding to terms and conditions of agreement executed with us. Therefore, we went into arbitration against all restaurants. No stay is imposed on the restaurants. Therefore, we sought NIT’s help in removing the restaurants. We even sent a letter to the NIT asking to take possession of the area,” he said.
 
 On November 3 last year, the state’s urban development department had rejected Sell Ads’ appeal seeking extension of agreement. NIT was supposed to remove the restaurants soon after the department’s decision.
 
 The agreement between NIT and operator had come to an end on August 16 last year.
