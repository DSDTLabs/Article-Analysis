Amit Shah's   campaign continued to flounder, with the   chief failing to garland the   statue at Chalukya Circle on Wednesday.

 Scheduled to garland the 12-foot-tall statue of the   icon and social reformer, Shah arrived at the location at 9.30am. The party chief was put on a crane, along with state president  .
 
 However, Basavanna remained out of Shah's reach, prompting him to fling the garland at the statue. The garland, however, slipped off and fell, leading to speculation of it being a "bad omen" for the BJP, which is trying to keep its votebank of the Lingayat community together in the face of Congress government's decision to accord minority status to Lingayats.
 
 Yeddyurappa though saved Shah's day by managing to garland Basavanna with a single fling.
 
 Earlier this month, during his tour of Mumbai-Karnataka region, Shah and Yeddyurappa had gone to garland the statue of Rani Chenamma at Kittur. Shah found it tough to reach the 13-foot-tall statue from atop a crane and SPG commandos had to help him fulfil his mission.
 
 
 
 The misadventure soon gave rise to war of words between the Congress and the BJP. State Congress social media in-charge Srivatsa tweeted: "Guru Basavanna rejects  ! Signs of things to come for the BJP". The BJP reacted: "When one has pure intentions and true devotion, no height is too high to scale."
