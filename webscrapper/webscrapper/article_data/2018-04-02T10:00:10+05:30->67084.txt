BENGALURU: The BJP on Sunday released three chargesheets against the Congress government, alleging that the chief minister has failed to maintain law and order and protect the interests of farmers.

 Union IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who inaugurated the BJP media centre in Malleswaram, released the chargesheets, ‘Law and order situation in Karnataka in a shambles’, ‘The Congress that gave pain to farmers who gave food’, and ‘Harm to Bengaluru from Siddaramaiah government’. “People have lost faith in the Congress because of its misrule and corruption. The Congress has been routed in many parts of the country and will be trounced in Karnataka too,” Prasad said.
