CHANDIGARH: The murder of lawyer   alias   (34) is still a mystery for his family more than 18 months after the incident.

  “From Day One, we alleged that the daughter of a sitting high court judge was involved in the murder case of Sippy Sidhu but police failed to nab her,” said  , the deceased’s brother. “The case is clear but a shoddy investigation by the UT police made it very complex,” he added. 
 
 Sippy Sidhu was shot dead at a park in   on September 20, 2015. Sippy’s family alleged that the reason behind the murder was that he turned down an offer to marry the daughter of a judge of Punjab and Haryana high court.
 
  A special investigative team was constituted, but they failed to get leads in the murder case. The family told the police that before leaving home on the fateful day, Sippy had said he was going to meet a female friend at Sector 27. 
 
 Sippy’s kin staged several protests in Chandigarh and Delhi and also met the Chief Justice of India and Union home minister and told about the involvement of the HC judge’s daughter. 
 
 Then IGP R P Upadhyay admitted that since the culprits were high up in the judiciary, it was difficult for the police to act. The family alleged that while the woman was interrogated, the police didn’t have the courage to arrest her. 
 
 After four months, then UT administrator   transferred the case to the CBI.
