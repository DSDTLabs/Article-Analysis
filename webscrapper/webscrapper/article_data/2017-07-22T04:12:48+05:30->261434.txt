MALDA: Two Class-X students of   village in English Bazaar allegedly killed themselves on Thursday night after their families objected to their affair. 

  (16), a student of Mohanpur  , was allegedly in a relationship with   Ghosh, who was from neighbouring village   and a student of Shovanagar High School. 
 
 Locals claimed the duo went to the same private tutor, where the affair began. Ramkrishna Das, a local from Mohanpur, said: "We all were aware of their relationship. In fact, sometimes the elders rebuked them." Both their families often scolded the two and Megha was reportedly hit by her parents over the issue. 
 
 On Thursday evening, the girl was again rebuked and she left home. The duo allegedly met at night. Their families launched a search for them but couldn't find them. On Friday morning, villagers found the duo hanging from a mango tree. They had used Megha's dupatta to kill themselves. A suicide note claimed that they had killed themselves because of the opposition to their relationship. 
 
 The boy's uncle claimed that the two knew each other, but said he was unaware of an affair between them. Megha's uncle said that they had never tortured the girl over the relationship. 
 
 Sunil Sarkar, headmaster of Nagharia High School, said, "We are shocked. How can a boy take such steps? Can't the parents even scold him? We have taken up a project of counselling adolescent students, apart from introducing yoga and meditation classes to prevent such incidents in the future." 
 
 Shovanagar High School headmaster   said: "She was a brilliant student. We're yet to accept that she took her own life."
