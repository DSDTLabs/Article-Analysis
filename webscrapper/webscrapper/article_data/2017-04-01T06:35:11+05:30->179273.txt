New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Friday wore a deserted look as lawyers answered the Bar Council of India’s call for a  .

 Advocates abstained from work protesting a proposed   that bars them from agitation and makes them liable to compensate litigants if they go on strike.
 
  said that “misconduct” has been defined in a “provocative” manner in the proposed Bill and would make it difficult and risky for a   to accept the brief of any client. Mishra told TOI that he and other office bearers met the Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and are hopeful for a solution.
 
 “Negligence, not showing due diligence, misbehaviour, dishonourable conduct (towards the client or towards the court or anybody) amounts to misconduct under the definition of Law Commission of India,” BCI said, in a release, claiming it will lead to usurping of their right to protest. 
 
 BCI, which is the apex body of lawyers, had called for a countrywide strike, saying the recommendations were against their interests.
 
 Apart from HC, judicial work was also affected in Delhi’s six district courts at Patiala House, Tis Hazari, Saket, Rohini, Karkardooma and Dwarka. Law Commission of India in its recommendation to the government has further proposed to impose a fine, which may extend up to Rs 3 lakh and the cost of proceedings. It has also sought to award compensation of such an amount, subject to a maximum of Rs 5 lakh as it may deem fit, payable to the person aggrieved by the misconduct of the advocate.
 
 Lawyers would also be liable to pay compensation to litigants if they abstain from work even if the client has not paid the advocate. Non-payment of fees either in full or in parts to the advocate shall not be a defence for the lawyer against whom claim for compensation has been made.
