MOHALI: The public health department of   is facing acute shortage of potable water. An increase in turbidity has reduced the production capacity making an adverse impact on production hours revealed public health department officials.

 
 A stark rise in temperature has also increased the water demand by 4 to 5 million gallons ( ) per day in Mohali which further aggravates the issues faced by public health department to meet drinking water needs.
 
 Anil Kumar, executive engineer at public health department, said, “Generally, water demand ranges between 13 to 15 MGD. In order to fulfill this, the department supplies 10 (MGD) from rivers and 3 MGD from tube wells bringing the cumulative supply to 13 MGD. The additional 3 MGD is supplied by GMADA which bring the total to 16 MGD.”
 
 “The requirement of drinking water in Mohali is around 28 MGD. The increasing turbidity in the water leads to reduction in production volume of purified water leading to water shortage,” he added.
 
 He further stated that turbidity increases as the snow melt in the higher ranges thus bringing along eroded mud and sand. “Normally, we get 5 to 8 Nephelometric   (NTU) which rises to 70 to 80   during the season consuming four additional hours a day to clean the turbidity thereby reducing production level,” said Anil.
 
 Manjit Singh, deputy mayor, said that the efforts are being made to meet demand of potable water. “Wastage of water should also be minimized,” he added.
