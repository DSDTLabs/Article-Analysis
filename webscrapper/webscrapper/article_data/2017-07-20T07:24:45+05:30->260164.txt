AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Wednesday denied legal protection to possible arrest of a groom's father who is accused of organizing a  .
Chamnaji Thakor of Ranip has been accused of arranging the marriage of his minor son with a 13-year-old girl from   on March 16.
 
 The marriage was solemnized according to community rites despite protests by the girl, who pointed out to Thakor and his family that she was underage. Yet, Thakor and the girl's family members arranged the marriage and the girl was sent to her matrimonial home.
 
 Upon return to her maternal home in May, she complained about forcible physical relationship on part of her husband. On May 7, when she found out that she would be taken to her matrimonial home again, she called up police control room and sought help.
 
 With police intervention, the girl was spared of the ordeal and four of her in-laws were arrested on charges of abetting rape and under provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). The provisions of Prevention of Child Marriage Act, 2006 have also been invoked in this case. They were released later on bail by   high court.
 
 The groom's father remained absconding since the police complaint. He approached the sessions court for anticipatory bail but his plea was turned down. Public prosecutor   vehemently opposed the bail plea on the grounds that despite the knowledge that the girl was not an adult and her resistance to marriage, Thakor had got his son married and had spoiled the underage bride's life.
 
 After hearing the case, special judge P B Singh rejected Thakor's anticipatory bail application on the grounds that the complaint against him does not appear false and that this case does not merit court's protection against the arrest.
