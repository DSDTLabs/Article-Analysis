CHENNAI: The Directorate of Town and Country Planning's ( ) initiative to speed up the approval process of building plans by sending the facility online has in effect slowed down the process, putting applicants in a fix. Land surveyors are complaining that preparing plans as per the specifications of the   software has become a cumbersome process causing delays in obtaining approvals. 

 Coimbatore-based S Kanagasundaram, ex-president,  , said the online application has 200 colours each indicating various parametres including parking lot and setback area. "In the event of a drawing plan inadvertently using a different shade of the same colour to indicate a boundary line, the software will reject the plan," he said. Options are not available for pre-checking mistakes before submitting it online, he added.
 
 DTCP mandated submission of plans online in September 2016 bringing an end to the manual filing of drawing plans across the state excluding the Chennai Metropolitan Area ( ). Hard copies of documents including patta and No Objection Certificates from various government agencies must be handed over to respective (DTCP) offices only after the drawing plan is processed online. The online facility has several advantages such as checking the status of applications on a realtime basis, no human intervention to process the drawing plan and ensure plans does not have any deviations from building rules. 
 
 But, the time taken to process it is the real challenge, observes A Natarajan, president of Association of Licensed Building Surveyors at Salem. "It is a time consuming process, wherein submission that used to take an hour manually is taking several hours online," he said. The association moved the Madras high court with a plea to direct the government to bring back the manual process till the grievences are addressed.
 
 When contacted, a DTCP official said regular training is provided to surveyors and architects about the online submission process.
