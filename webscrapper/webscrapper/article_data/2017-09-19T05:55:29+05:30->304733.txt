GANDHINAGAR: BJP president   has appealed to the leaders of the state’s cooperative sector to   of the state for achieving party’s target of 150-plus seats in the   

 Addressing a  , he said, “Gujarat’s cooperative sector has emerged as the model for India. The variety seen in Gujarat’s co-operative sector is not seen anywhere, whether it is milk, sugar, fish or agriculture.” 
 
 “Gandhiji’s trusteeship principle has been well implemented by Gujarat’s co-operatives,” Shah said, adding, “The co-operative sector has collapsed in UP, Bihar and Maharashtra while it’s growing here.”
 
 Targeting Congress, Shah said, “Congress will promise everything, like in every election, but will not do anything.”
 
 “Whether Sardar Patel, Morarjibhai or Narendrabhai, they opposed everyone. Congress says the Narmada canal work is incomplete. They can’t see the underground pipelines from their Italian vision,” Shah said.
 
 “Go to villages in other states and compare the situation there with that in Gujarat. Congress lost Maharashtra, Jharkhand, UP, Manipur but still it thinks that it would come to power in Gujarat. When Narendrabhai was CM of Gujarat, BJP had won 128 seats. Now, he is PM, so we will go for 150 seats,” he said.
 
 “We need to be alert against those who want to disturb the peace prevailing here. Don’t remain a spectator. Your responsibility is to set the tone and highlight the development done by BJP among the farmer,” the BJP president urged the co-operative sector leaders.
