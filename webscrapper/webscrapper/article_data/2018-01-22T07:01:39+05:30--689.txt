RAJKOT: Bottleggers in Devbhoomi Dwarka district have found an innovative way to hide their liquor stock. The police had to actually undertake an adventure to seize liquor in Ranpar village of Bhanvad taluka on Saturday night.

 The liquor stock was hidden in a deep cave by the riverside and police had to jostle their way through the cracks to seize the bottles. 
 
 “It was an hour long operation which made us feel like mountaineers or rock climbers. We snaked our way into the cave through cracks and recovered the liquor bottles secreted there,” said an official from Devbhoomi Dwarka local crime branch (LCB). They removed 360 IMFL bottles worth Rs 1.44 lakh. 
 
 Bootleggers—Bogha Samala and Raja Kodiyatar, both residents of Ranpar village—had fled from the spot before the raid. 
 
 Earlier on Friday night, police had raided the same place and confiscated 1,104 bottles worth Rs 2.40 lakh from a car. Bootleggers—Popat Kodiyatar and Balu Kodiyatar—had fled before the raid. Also on the same night, the LCB had raided an orchard on the outskirts of Ranpar and arrested   Kodiyatar. A total of 216 beer cans and 12 bottles of IMFL were seized from him. During his interrogation, Karan said that he had procured the liquor supply from Popat and Balu.
 
 In another operation, Gir Somnath local crime branch (LCB) intercepted a truck and seized 18,575 IMFL bottles worth Rs 9.28 lakh. Afzal Qureshi (26) and   (28), both residents of  , were arrested from the spot.
