Coimbatore: VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan has demanded the state government to form a special investigation committee led by a woman judge to bring out the truth in the assistant professor Nirmala Devi’s case. 

 He added that there was a competition between governor and the state government to know who was powerful. “So, the CB-CID and retired IAS officer Santhanam’s committee inquires could not bring the truth,” he said.
 
 Welcoming the CPM demand to recall the governor, Thirumavalavan said, “The governor activities were challenging the state government and he was acting as an independent. He appointed vice-chancellors without discussing the state government.”
 
 Speaking to reporters at International airport in the city, Thirumavalavan alleged that BJP leader H Raja and S Ve Shekar were trying to divert the people from the Cauvery issue by posting tweets through their twitter accounts. The duo should be arrested by the police for the welfare of the state, he said. “People should focus on the CMB issue and should not fall prey to the BJP’s activities,” he added. He also condemned the attack against MDMK leader Vaiko and demanded action against the people involved in it.
