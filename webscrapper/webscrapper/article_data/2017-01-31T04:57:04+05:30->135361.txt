GURUGRAM: If you think   only ignore people’s grievance calls, this may bring you some comfort.   has slapped a showcause notice on one of its officials for failing to answer phone calls, albeit, from his senior.

 The disciplinary action has been taken against   (survey) S K Rana after he failed to respond to repeated calls from the mobile number of estate officer-II Sanjeev Singhla on January 26. Singhla had made the calls reportedly to get some information sought by Huda head office. 
 
 Though January 26 is a national holiday, senior government officials are supposed to remain available, at least over the phone, for any emergency.
 
 Terming the behaviour as “indiscipline and ignorance” in its notice, the urban development body has asked Rana to explain why action should not be taken against him. “It seems you are not taking interest in official work, which is gross negligence on your part. It causes indiscipline in office and hampers office work,” stated the notice issued to Rana by the estate officer-II.
 
 When contacted, Rana sought to downplay the issue as a “minor internal affair”. “I have given my explanation and the matter is resolved,” he said. However, he refused to comment on the allegations about his indifference towards work.
 
 Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav said officials were here to work for the people. “If there is any issue, we will look into it,” he added.
 
 Residents who have regularly dealt with Huda officials, though, alleged Huda officials are themselves the biggest culprits, notorious for ignoring grievance calls and harassing people for even small pieces of work that need to be done.
