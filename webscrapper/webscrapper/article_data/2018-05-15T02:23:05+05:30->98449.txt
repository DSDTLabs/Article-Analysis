GURUGRAM: Over the years, exit number 6 on the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway (NH-8) has turned into a high-risk accident-prone spot. The reason — many   use the   exit as an entry point to the carriageway going to Jaipur. While coming from DLF 2 or DLF Square, many people tend to drive against the flow of traffic to reach the expressway, as the proper route involves an additional kilometre of driving. When TOI visited the spot, a biker was spotted taking the wrong route every 2-3 minutes, whereas one car in every 10-15 minutes was seen breaking the law.

 “The correct route is much longer, and involves taking a detour through the congested Iffco Chowk, often causing delays, which is why many people tend to take a  , drive against traffic flow, and reach exit number six to enter the highway. Once a cab driver took us down that route, and I remember it being quite scary, since there were vehicles coming at us from all sides,” said Aanchal Chaturvedi, who works at a multinational firm in Cyber Hub.
 
  
 Wrong side driving on this stretch is not merely a traffic violation, but a serious hazard, as it could lead to head-on collisions with vehicles exiting the expressway at speed. Given that a lot of heavy vehicles, such as state road transport buses, exit the highway at this point, the possibility of these accidents turning fatal is very high. 
 
 Besides, during rush hours, such an otherwise small disruption often causes long tailbacks on the highway itself, adding to congestion on the stretch.
