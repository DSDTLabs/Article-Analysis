 VISAKHAPATNAM: In a huge relief for PG   admitted under the management quota, the high court on Thursday temporarily suspended GO 99, freeing them from the mandate of having to work as senior residents for a year in their parent institutions. 
 
 Ever since the GO was issued, students admitted under management quota were up in arms over the new regulations regarding senior residentship and staged protests across the state, demanding a rollback of the order and suspension of the ongoing counselling.
 
 Welcoming the move, the   said the GO was issued with a view to benefit private institutions. The GO mandated students admitted under management quota to work as senior residents for one year in their parent institutions, which was not the case till 2016. 
 
 As per the GO, an honorarium of 28,000 for PG diploma candidates, 33,000 for degree candidates and 41,000 for PG super-speciality candidates will be paid per month for candidates admitted under convenor quota. An honorarium of 50,000 per month for PG diploma and degree candidates will be paid for candidates admitted under management quota by the institute. 
 
 Until 2016, students from private colleges were free to work even in government colleges after completion of education. Under the new regulations, even private colleges were allowed to begin senior residentship programme.
