GURUGRAM: Rising heat has taken a toll on winged pets in Gurugram. In the past 10 days, more than 150 exotic pet birds have been taken to  , the city’s only bird hospital.

 According to the hospital’s ornithologists, pet parents from across the city are visiting to get birds treated as there has been a sudden increase in cases of heat stroke, diarrhoea and chicken pox among exotic species, such as love birds, blue rock pigeon, African grey parrot, Australian bird (also called bazri parrots) and macaw.
 
 While 15 to 20 cases of heat stroke are reported every day, 20 cases of diarrhoea and 15 cases of chicken pox were reported during the last 10 days. “While we have admitted a few birds that need intensive care, most are sent back with medication,” said Dr. Rajkumar, a senior ornithologist at Jain  , Jacobpura.
 
 Kumar added that heat stroke could lead to deaths in many cases. “Birds generally fall off owing to heat stroke and nausea, which can lead to severe injuries and ultimately death. Many times, pet parents don’t understand the symptoms,” he said.
 
 Some ornithologists call it an ‘emergency situation’. “Sudden heat wave leads to shock, especially in   that are not meant to live in this environment. It is an emergency situation and there is need for awareness,” said Dr. Bansi Lal Sharma, an ornithologist at Sushant Lok I.
 
 “Exotic birds are more prone to heat as these are not native Indian species. Special care is required for exotic birds in summers. Keep them in an air conditioned environment or at least in a cool room. Give them cold water mixed with ORS. Most importantly, clean the vessels in which water and food is served as unclean vessels cause severe diarrhoea,” said Dr. Tanvi Marwah, another ornithologist.
 
 As of now, a total of 335 birds are admitted to the charitable hospital.
