Mysuru: In a move which is expected to create controversy,   ( ) vice chancellor D Shivalingaiah issued an order prohibiting the varsity authorities from speaking to media without his permission.

 He has directed them not to work out of their jurisdiction and dispose files according to the previous system.
 
 In a letter to all the section heads of the university, Shivalingaiah stated that a few university authorities were meddling with the works of other departments resulting in autocratic decisions and poor coordination.
 
 “Besides this, various sensitive issues related to the university, including court matters and government letters, were being leaked to the media without the approval of vice chancellor. This has affected the image of the university. Keeping this in mind, the university authorities must take the permission of the vice chancellor before issuing statements related to varsity matters and police cases to the media,” he said in the letter.
 
 “All officers must work within their departments and dispose the files within their jurisdiction, like earlier. Anyone violating the set rules will be held responsible,” he further said.
 
 K S Shivaramu, one of the members of the KSOU Board of Management (BoM), told TOI that after a gap of nearly three years some work was happening at the university. “To ensure that there is no confusion regarding university-related issues the VC would have issued this order. I welcome this move,” he said.
 
 But a few insiders feel that with the state government coming out with stringent actions to clean up the mess created in the KSOU, the   will send mixed signals. “A lot of developments are happening inside the university. These directions will lead to suspicions instead of correcting the system. Instead of issuing an order, the VC should have taken all the authorities into confidence and moved in a right direction,” said an officer who wished to be unnamed.
 
 The VC was not available for comments.
