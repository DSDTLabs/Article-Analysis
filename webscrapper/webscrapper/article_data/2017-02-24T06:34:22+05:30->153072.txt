CHANDIGARH:   has been exporting its   (to the rest of India) in the form of  . This strong statement has come from one of   R S Ghuman in his study titled ‘Water Use Scenario in Punjab beyond the Sutlej–Yamuna Link Canal’.

 The study was published in ‘Economic & Political Weekly’ journal in its January edition and some of its observations are crucial at a time when Punjab and Haryana are eyeball-to-eyeball over the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal.
 
 Ghuman, professor at CRRID, who was earlier heading the economics department of Punjabi University, has pointed out that there is need to address the problem of excessive irrigation for paddy, lesser rainfall and canal water coupled with growing number of tubewells and its result in depleting water table in the state.
 
 Ghuman told TOI, “On the SYL canal, there is need for review of the water supplies of the Beas and Ravi calculated to be 17.17 million acre feet (MAF) as part of the agreement in 1981. The situation in Punjab has changed drastically since then.”
 
 “A serious review, taking into account the current availability of the quantity of water, is of utmost importance. The optimum use of water, especially for paddy irrigation, can save substantial amount of water, thus, reducing the intensity of conflicts over river water sharing. The two states need to give increased attention to sustainable use of water, along with asserting their claims over the river waters,” said Ghuman, who is former vice-president of Indian Society of Labour Economics.
 
 “There is also an urgent need to have a strong policy intervention to reduce the area under paddy or find less water consuming varieties of paddy. Micro irrigation, direct sowing and sowing on raised beds need to be promoted in a big way. Rainwater harvesting, conservation of water and sustainably-informed use of water are necessary routes to save Punjab and Haryana from turning into a desert,” added Ghuman.
 
 PADDY PROBLEM
 
 Traditionally, Punjab has never been a rice producing and consuming region. Paddy accounted for only 6% of the cropped area in 1960-61 which increased to 69% in 2012-13. The share of area under paddy in kharif cereals increased from 33% in 1961 to 96% in 2013.
 
 Paddy has been the main culprit for depleting water table as it needs 22-25 irrigations in a span of four months. The combined evapotranspiration in wheat and paddy is 1,030mm.
 
 The problem of groundwater scarcity started raising its head during the 1980s and was highlighted by the Johl Committee reports on crop diversification. However, the Punjab government responded for the first time in 2004 by constituting a state-level committee on ground- water resources estimation. The committee submitted its report in 2012 without any effective recommendations. The state’s policy of giving free electricity to the farm sector (followed also by Haryana) further hinders crop diversification and results in unsustainable use of water.
 
 LESSER CANAL WATER
 
 At the same time, availability of canal water to the state has been drying up. “Out of the total irrigated area of 20.20 lakh hectares in 1960-61, 58% was under canal irrigation. It declined to 27% in 2014. The area under canal irrigation reached at its plateau (16.60 lakh hectares) in 1990-91, thereafter it started declining.”
 
 TUBEWELL TROUBLE
 
 The result was, says Ghuman, that most of the farmers have already deepened their tubewells six to eight times during 1975-2005. “The number of tubewells in Punjab increased from 1.92 lakh in 1970-71 to 13.85 lakh in 2013-14. The per hectare tubewell intensity, in terms of net sown area, increased from 0.047 in 1970-71 to 0.334 in 2013-14. In 2000-01, the share of tubewell irrigated area increased to 76% (30.74 lakh hectares) and thereafter, its share remained around 73%. Not only the area under irrigation – and that too under tubewell irrigation – increased but irrigation intensity also increased from 54% in 1960-61 to 99% in 2011.” The net deficit of groundwater for irrigation development in Punjab increased from 8.01 million hectare feet in 2004 to 12.02 million hectare feet in 2011.
 
 POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS
 
 “In view of the ensuing assembly elections in Punjab in February 2017, the political atmosphere is highly surcharged over the SYL canal issue. There has been a water war between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over Cauvery water. The SYL canal has similar seeds in its bed,” adds the study.
