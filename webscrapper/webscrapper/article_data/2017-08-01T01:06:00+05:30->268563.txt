Coimbatore: A parotta master was sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment by a Mahila court on Monday for driving his wife to commit suicide about five years ago. On the night of February 28, 2012, Rajesh, 29, had come drunk to his house in Ganapathy Nagar, near Rathinapuri. When his wife, Stella Mary, asked him for money for their household expenses, Rajesh began abusing her mentally and physically. 

 Since this was the situation at their home for several years , Stella Mary, in a state of depression and helplessness, poured kerosene over her body and immolated herself. Hearing the shouts and smelling the smoke, the neighbours rushed inside the house and doused the fire with water. But by the time her body was fully burnt. She was rushed to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, where she was treated before she succumbed to injuries. A few days later, based on a complaint filed by Stella Mary’s father Arulanandham at the Kattoor All Women Police Station, Rajesh was arrested and lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison. The final judgement was delivered by Justice Manimozhi after Rajesh’s role in Stella’s suicide was proved. He would be lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison. tnn
