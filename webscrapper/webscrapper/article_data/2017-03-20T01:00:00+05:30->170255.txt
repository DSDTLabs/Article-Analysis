 The youngster, who is appearing for her XII board exams and is shuttling between Varanasi and Mumbai said, "During the shooting of 'Sapane Suhane Ladakpan Ke', I had to jump in river Ganga to save one of the characters of the show as it was part of the scene. Despite people dissuading me, I went into river Ganga and it was one of the most ethereal experience. Despite so much of activity on the ghats, river Ganga lends a kind of serenity. Recently I had the privilege to witness the Ganga aarti and it was one of the most beautiful experiences that I ever had. In fact, I have enjoyed everything for which Banaras is famous for, which includes lassi and of course, the Banarasi paan."
