NEW DELHI:   on Sunday released evidence to show that   paid Rs 11 lakh to a prominent five-star hotel for the high-priced   of Rs 13,000 per plate for the first anniversary celebration of the   government. 

 Although   has not disputed the amount of Rs 13,000 per plate, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had claimed on Saturday that no payment was made and that a probe had been ordered. 
 
 However, BJP leaders, including spokesperson Sambit Patra and Delhi MLA Vijender Gupta, came out with fresh evidence claiming that no probe was set up and the payment had also been cleared. “Sisodia should either deny our allegations or he should apologise and accept that he has lied and tried to fool people with false claims,” Gupta said.
 
 He said 30 people had lunch on day one and 60 were present the next day. The first day’s charge was Rs 12,500 per plate and it was Rs 16,025 the next day. “Sisodia and Kejriwal should let people of Delhi know what was there on the menu,” added Gupta. 
 
 Gupta alleged that there was no inquiry but Sisodia had mysteriously kept the bill with himself for two months. “Sisodia had summoned the bill related file on June 20 but it reached the special secretary’s office on September 21. The deputy CM should explain why he sat on the file for two months,” he said.
 
 Gupta further asked Sisodia to prove with evidence that he had ordered an inquiry in the case as he had claimed on Saturday. He further urged LG Anil Baijal to set up a judicial inquiry and initiate action against those responsible for squandering taxpayers’ money on high-priced food by politicians who had sought votes promising probity and transparency.
