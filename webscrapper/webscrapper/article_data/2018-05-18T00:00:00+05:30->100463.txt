Sharan's   2 hits the screens today. The actor, who has also produced the film with his friends, is thrilled that he could shoot for some parts of the film in North Karnataka, which is where he hails from. "Shooting in   always is special for me. I come from the region and I ensure that everything is perfect according to the way it is there. This film, unfortunately, didn't require any special dialect or other detailing, but I still ensured we projected the North Karnataka ethos right," says  . 
The actor says that he loves visiting the area and it has a special space in his heart. "Everything about North Karnataka excites me. In fact, the moment I cross Chitradurga, I begin feeling like I'm closer home. This is because I get to see people dressing like the way they do back at home in   and the dialect of the language also sees a small change from how it is in the southern parts of the state," says Sharan.
 The actor, who also likes to sing and has lent his voice to a couple of songs, says that he has never been formally trained in singing. But, he credits his theatre lineage from   for this. "As far as I can remember, everyone at home has been singing. They've been into theatre and singing is a part of traditional theatre. I've had an ear for music since childhood, which has probably helped me as a singer," says Sharan.
