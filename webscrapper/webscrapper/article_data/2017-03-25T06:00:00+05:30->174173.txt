DALTONGANJ: In an incident believed to be a fallout in the war of supremacy between two groups of Maoists, three rebels were on Friday killed in a gun battle in Sitachuan village under Palamu district’s Mohammadganj police station.   have caught an injured rebel and recovered a huge   and ammunition. 

 Police said that one of those killed has been identified as Ajay Yadav, sub zonal commander of the CPI( ). He was carrying a reward of Rs 10 lakh on his head for his role in at least 10 cases of Maoist-related violence. Police had recently named him an accused in the incident of setting afire the house of a dalit para-teacher at Gowasarey village.
 
 DIG (Palamu) Vipul Shukla said, “The Maoists were undone by their own men. The two others have been identified as Surinder Yadav and Dhirender.” 
 
 Police said the death of Yadav will give a huge jolt to the rebels. Ajay’s brother, Amrit Yadav, was an important leader of the outfit and was killed nine years ago. Soon, Ajay stepped into the shoes of his brother and took charge of the group. However, sources said Ajay’s high handedness and casteist leadership had not gone down well with other members of the outfit and he was seen as a thorn in flesh for Maoists of other castes.
 
 Superintendent of police (Palamu) Indrajeet Mahatha said, “The casualties are the result of the rebels’ own fight and struggle.”
 
 “Some of the Maoists have sustained injuries but managed to flee the area. We have registered a case and the bodies were sent for post-mortem,’’ Shukla added. He said that security forces have launched combing operation in the area. 
 
 Police have recovered a cache of arms and ammunition, including an AK 47 rifle, an Insas rifle and 630 live cartridges, 23 magazines and IEDs, from the spot.
