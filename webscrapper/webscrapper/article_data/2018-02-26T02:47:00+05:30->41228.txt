Vijayawada: TDP MLA Bonda Umamaheswara Rao has said that he will   politics if anyone can prove that an inch of   was illegally occupied by him or his family members. Refuting allegations of land grabbing, he said that his opponents are maligning his name as they are unable to compete with him politically. 

 Speaking to reporters here on Sunday, Rao said that a development agreement was signed between Abdul Mastan, the person to whom K Suresh Babu, grandson of   Kesireddy Suryanarayana allegedly sold his land to, and Raviteja Biotech Private Limited, owned by Rao’s wife Bonda Sujata on April 20, last year. He clarified, the land in the agreement is merely 0.7 acres and not 4 acres as alleged in the case. Rao, however, admitted that the deal was brought to him by Maganti Babu, who stands accused in the CID case filed on January 23.
 
 Rao said that the agreement was cancelled on December 4, 2017, after he found out that the ownership of the land is disputed and there were pending court cases over it. He further clarified that the cancellation was done legally through a registered document. “After the cancellation of the agreement neither I nor any of my member were involved in the issue,” he averred. Rao also denied land grabbing allegations in Rajarajeswaripeta and Penamaluru that came to light after the freedom fighter land scam. Interestingly, when Krishna district joint collector K Vijaya Krishnan took up the Rs 40 crore freedom fighter land   case on Saturday and called both the complainant and the accused for a magisterial inquiry, , neither Bonda Sujatha nor MLA Rao appeared before the collector.
