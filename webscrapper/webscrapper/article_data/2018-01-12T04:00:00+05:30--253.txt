Surat: During his address at the Parents Association of Surat’s event, state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma tried to convince the parents that the state government was committed to take all necessary steps to ensure that schools don’t charge high fees. However, his assurance did little to placate the angry parents.  In his speech Chudasma said, “Don’t participate in the school bandh call given by some groups and support government which is fighting for all the parents. Government won the case in high court against the school administrators and the fees regulation will be strictly implemented.” Chudasma announced that a total of 437 schools have informed the fee regulation committee (FRC) that they have decreased their fees. However, the FRC or the district education office were not able to provide details of the schools. Chudamsa also announced that P H Bachkaniwala School has been fined Rs 50,000 for running playgroup without informing the FRC. “Bachkaniwala School did not inform the FRC about the playgroup they were running. They were collecting fees for it. The FRC found the irregularity and fined the school,” said Rupin Pachhigar, a member of FRC, who had informed the minister about the case.
