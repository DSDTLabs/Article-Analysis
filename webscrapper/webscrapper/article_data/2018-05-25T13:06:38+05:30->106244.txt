HYDERABAD: Fearing a repeat of 2017 when incessant bouts of heavy rainfall left them stranded in their houses for days, several residents of Malkajgiri's   have vacated their homes this year - right before the onset of monsoon. 

 
 When TOI visited the locality on Thursday, 'To Let' boards were found adorning the walls of these empty residences. Members of local residential welfare associations confirmed that the inmates had moved to other places, to escape the wrath of rains that had compelled   teams to rush in, in September last year, to rescue trapped residents. 
 
 "September 13 is a dreadful day in the calenders of people living here. With authorities doing nothing to resolve the issue, residents are worried about living the nightmare again this year. So, a lot of people have shifted out," said  , an advocate from the area. 
 
 K Aruna (name changed) own an independent house there. While the family had initially thought of staying put at least until September, they have now decided against it. "After my husband reliably learnt that works related to monsoon preparedness aren't been taken up yet, we decided to lease our home and move to a rented accommodation," said Aruna.
 
 GHMC officials said the work will be set in motion only after land acquisition. "Land acquisition is under process; 18 crore sanctioned for it doesn't cover acquisition cost," said  , superintendent engineer, GHMC (projects departments). Only desilting of nalas has been carried out, another official said.
