 MUMBAI: Two men on a bike, posing as cops, robbed a transport company staff of Rs 1.90 lakh cash.The incident occurred on April 6 around 9 pm. 

 The duo approached the victim while he was talking to a driver at   near the container yard in   and flashed torch on his face, behaving like cops patrolling the area. They then snatched away his polythene bag which contained the cash and fled. 
 
 Acting on a complaint lodged by the victim,  , an FIR has been registered at Uran police station. Inspector (crime)   said, "It is possible that the robbers had kept a watch on Verma's activities and knew that he always carried huge cash to pay drivers for fuel and other expenses."
 
  Pretending to be cops, they even asked him whether he was carrying drugs in the bag. They demanded to check the bag when Verma told them that it contained cash to buy fuel. 
 
 As the biker kept Verma engaged in conversation, his pillion rider snatched the bag and they sped away. 
 
 "As of now, we do not have any leads about the duo. The bike's registration number turned out to be fake. As there is no CCTV surveillance in the area, there is no evidence of the robbery. Hence, we have sought mobile tower data in the locality to zero-in on the suspects who seem to be history-sheeters," added inspector Majage.
