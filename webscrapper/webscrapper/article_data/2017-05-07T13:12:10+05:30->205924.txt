BHUBANESWAR: As many as   took oath as   while four others inducted as minister of state on Sunday as part of the much-hyped reshuffle of the three-year old cabinet in the fourth term of chief minister  .

 Governor S C Jamir administered the oath of office and secrecy to the new ministers at the Abhishek hall in Raj Bhavan here in presence of the chief minister, his colleagues in the cabinet and other dignitaries.
 
 Those who are inducted as cabinet ministers include Digapahandi MLA  , Niranjan Pujari (Sonepur), Pratap Jena (Mahanga), Maheswar Mohanty (Puri), Prafulla Samal (Bhandaripokhari) and Sashi Bhusan Behera (Jayadev).
 
 Similarly, Bhograi MLA Ananta Das, Nrusingha Sahu (Parjang), Susanta Singh (Bhatli) and Chandrasarathi Behera (Cuttack sadar) are included in Naveen’s new team as minister of state.
 
 Portfolios allocations to the new ministers will be done later on Sunday.
 
 “People of Odisha have high hopes from the BJD government and chief minister Naveen Patnaik. We will do everything possible to fulfill their aspirations,” Surya Patra told reporters after taking oath.
 
 “I will work for strengthening party and ensure the state government schemes reach people in Bargarh. Whatever responsibility will be delegated to me, I will carry out the same honestly,” said Susanta Singh, a first-time minister.
 
 As part of the reshuffle, Naveen promoted two of the existing ministers—Prafulla Mallik and Ramesh Majhi to cabinet rank. Initially, they were inducted in 2014 as minister of state with independent charges.
 
 Meanwhile, name of Karanjia MLA Bijay Nayak, supposed to take oath as minister of state, was dropped at the last moment on Saturday night. He was recently in the eye of the storm after a local television channel recently aired a video in which he was caught while allegedly demanding money.
 
 Interestingly, not a single leader from the 10, who were dropped from the cabinet on Saturday, turned up for the swearing-in ceremony.
