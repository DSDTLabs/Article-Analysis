DHANBAD: The two warring factions of Congress's trade union wing   (Intuc), led by former MP   and G  , are awaiting the  's verdict on which group is the original one 

  With the court hearing scheduled for January 20, senior leaders of both factions are camping in the national capital. 
 
  The Union labour ministry had in August 2016 issued an order that Intuc could not be a part of the Joint Bipartite Coal Committee of India (JBCCI) or any national or international committee due to the dispute. Being a central trade union, Intuc earlier represented laboureres at the International Labour Organization (ILO). One faction has 3.35 crore members while the other faction has 3.37 crore members. 
 
  According to the labour ministry order, both the factions cannot enjoy membership of any bipartite or tripartite committee of any ministry. Intuc has more than 13 lakh members across the country. Both the factions have a significant presence in the state's mining belt. 
 
  Chandrashekar Dubey, president of one of the faction, told TOI he had tried to unite the two groups, but the matter went to court. Insisting that his faction is the original one, Dubey said: "We hope the court's decision is in our favour."
