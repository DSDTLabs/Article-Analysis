NEW DELHI: Police on Sunday arrested four   who had allegedly followed union textiles minister  's car on Saturday. They invoked sections 354D (stalking) and 509 (outraging the modesty of a woman) of IPC after Irani filed a complaint late in the night on Saturday. 

 The students — Avinash, Anand, Kunal and Shitanshu — were granted bail later in the day.
 
 In her complaint, Irani claimed that she was returning from   around 5pm. When she reached  , she spotted “four gentlemen” in a white car with a yellow number plate approaching her car in a “potentially obstructive manner”. 
 
 The four men “gesticulated in a lewd fashion” while chasing her car, she said. She asked the driver to put on the siren, but the men “persisted with their intimidation”, she said. 
 
 Irani then dialled 100. Soon, the cops intercepted them near the French embassy. Irani came to   and told cops about the incident. The four youths were medically examined and found to be in “inebriated condition”.
 
 Police sources claimed that, in their statement, the accused said they had consumed alcohol at a friend’s birthday party. After the party, they went out on a ride for fun. In the car, they were making videos to upload on social media. Apologising to the minister, they said any “chase” was unintentional and that they did not know that the minister was in the car.
 
 TOI visited the Basant Gaon residence of two of the youths. Their landlord said the two had not paid rent for two months and were to move out. “We got to know about the incident this morning when police came to our house. The youths have told us that they had gone to a friend’s house after college and were on their way to have ice cream at India Gate when they were arrested,” the landlord said.
