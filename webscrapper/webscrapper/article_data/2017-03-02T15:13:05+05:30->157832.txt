Many attempts are being made lately to de-stigmatize depression. Many people, and even celebrities, are becoming vocal about having gone through or going through depression, but that hasn’t solved the problem enough. Yet, we have people who believe   is only a sad state of mind that can be cured by asking a person about his health twice. For many, still, it is a shame and cannot happen to their kin. And there are some, who still live in denial of its existence.

 There are things that people who face it want us to know. It isn’t easy, it never was, and maybe, we are making it tougher for them. The least we can do is understand at least an edge of what they go through.
 
  
  
 
 "Depression isn’t a bad phase or a bad mood. Neither is it just a bad day. It lives with us every single day and we deal with it as best as we can."
 
 "There may NOT be any reason for our depression. We could be rich, famous, poor, everything or nothing. The fact is – it doesn’t matter."
 
 "We understand you care but you don’t understand certain things. A fun trip or marriage won’t cure us of our depression."
 
 "It is not just in the mind; it also drains us physically. It DOES have  ."
 
 "We may seem cold and distant to you but we need our friends the most now, than ever."
 
 "You may call us ‘Negative Nancies’ behind us but we understand. We sometimes can get too much to deal with but chances are, we are trying our best not to hurt you."
 
 "We may have some days not that sad. We can in fact be happy, feel okay and do things normally. But that doesn’t mean we are ‘over it’."
 
 "Try not to be too hard on us. Most probably, we already are pretty hard on ourselves."
 
 "And finally, remember that being depressed is not a choice. We didn’t choose to be like this."
