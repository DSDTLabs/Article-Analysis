NEW DELHI: Taking justice delivery as high priority, the government has started   with all registrars general of high courts every month to evaluate pendency reduction, infrastructure issues and other matters.

 State governments have been involved in this exercise and have been asked to take part in these conferences through their principal secretary, law. Some of the meetings have already been held with law ministry officials where the emphasis has been laid on state governments and HCs producing utilisation certificates of the expenditure carried out on several central schemes on infrastructure development.
 
 “The idea of these video conferencing is to evaluate the needs of the judiciary and redress them on priority and expedite the  ,” a senior official said. The meetings have been scheduled once a week with at least six HCs and senior officials of the respective states.
 
 There are 24 HCs in the country and a meeting every week completes the cycle of one HC being represented every month in these video conferencing, the official said. The higher judiciary has often raised the issue of lack of court infrastructure as one of the major impediments that has led to huge pendency. At least 2.63 crore cases are pending in lower courts as on January 24, 2018, a quarter of which have been pending for more than five years.
 
 District and subordinate courts, which are under the administrative control of the respective HCs, have more than 6,000 judges’ vacancies. These vacancies are to be filled up over the next few years where state governments need to build more court rooms. The Centre has allocated Rs 3,320 crore for construction of more than 3,100 court rooms in the next three years, in addition to constructing 1,700 new residential accommodation for these judges.
 
 The idea of video conferencing is to “assist the judiciary for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency” by providing better infrastructure and by filling up vacancies.
