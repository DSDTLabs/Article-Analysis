NEW DELHI: Passengers onboard the Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) train 64464 from Panipat to   were in for a shock on Tuesday morning when the train mistakenly   up at Old Delhi railway station due to wrong signalling and route-setting by a railway log operator.

 The train was later sent back to New Delhi railway station with officials saying that operation of other trains was not affected.
 
 
  
 
 The log operator was suspended after the incident and an inquiry was ordered to fix responsibility on other erring staff members. Officials said that confusion resulted in the train being diverted to Old Delhi station. EMU 64464 was running at a slight delay and the operator confused the train with another EMU 640004, which was supposed to go to Old Delhi, said an official.
 
 Railway officials said EMU 64464 generally reaches New Delhi railway station via Sabzi Mandi at around 7.30am. On Tuesday morning, however, the train was running at a slight delay and reached Sabzi Mandi at around 7.38am, the same time that EMU 64004 was scheduled to reach from Sonipat for Old Delhi.
 
 “Due to similarities between the actual arrival time of 64464 and scheduled arrival of 64004 and further, by miscommunication by the log operators, 64464 was sent to Old Delhi, instead of 64004,” said a senior railway official.
 
 The train reached platform 12 of Old Delhi at around 7.50am, by which time some passengers were frantically making calls on the railway helpline number. Officials said the mistake was, however, realised within minutes and the train departed for New Delhi railway station at 7.55am.
 
 “The log operator, Mr Aslam, has been suspended and an inquiry has been initiated into the matter. Track operations were not affected in any way and all passengers reached the correct station,” a railway official said.
