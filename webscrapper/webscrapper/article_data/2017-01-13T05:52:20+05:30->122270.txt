HYDERABAD: Three children and an adult suffered injuries after an unknown chemical used by a goldsmith fell on them at Gansi bazar late on Wednesday. The Charminar police said one-and-half-year-old Arnab and 12-year-old Pritam suffered 15% burns, while two others suffered negligible injuries. 

 Police said Swapan, a goldsmith from Bengal who makes and polishes ornaments, was in the process of shifting his house. He kept a chemical used for polishing ornaments in the balcony. Accidentally, the chemical container, containing about two litres of substance, fell and the liquid flowed into an outlet, which drains water during cleaning. 
 
 "From this outlet, the chemical spilled on Arnab, who was in his sister's arms, and his sister. It also fell on an auto driver and Pritam, who also suffered minor burn injuries," Charminar inspector K Chandrasekhar Reddy told TOI. A case of negligence was registered against Swapan and a probe was on to ascertain the chemical. The injured were shifted to   (OGH), where they were undergoing treatment in the burns ward.
