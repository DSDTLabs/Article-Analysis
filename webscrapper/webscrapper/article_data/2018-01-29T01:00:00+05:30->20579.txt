Varun Sharma, who shot to fame as Choocha in the ' ' series, seems to be on a professional high. He will next be seen in the Kriti Sanon-Diljit Dosanjh- starrer 'Arjun Patiala', which is a buddy-cop film. 

 Varun will play a quirky character, Onida Singh. The film will also mark Varun’s third outing with Kriti, after Dilwale and Raabta. Confirming the news, Varun tells us, “Onida Singh is a character I grew attached to after Choocha. The film is a situational comedy, and it will be a reunion of sorts for Kriti and me, which will be interesting. I am looking forward to having a lot of fun while filming it. Diljit and I will bond over Punjabi. I have been listening to his songs since my college days. I can’t wait to shoot with him and listen to all the Punjabi songs.”
 
 We are sure that the audience is waiting for this one, too.
