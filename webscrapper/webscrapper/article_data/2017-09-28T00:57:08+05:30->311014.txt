A 50-member fishermen team from Tamil Nadu has left for Sri Lanka to salvage seven of the 42 fishing boats released by the island nation.

 A team of fisheries department officials will join the team on Thursday. The entire salvage mission is coordinated with the support of Indian high commission in Jaffna and the Sri Lankan navy, according to state fisheries department.
 
 The team sailing in seven fishing trawlers will tow the seven boats which are anchored at the Karainagar naval base in Sri Lanka.
 
 Since February 2015, Sri Lankan naval agencies have confiscated more than 180 fishing crafts, which sailed from Tamil Nadu and Karaikal, on charges of poaching in the territorial waters of the island nation. In August, Sri Lanka released 42 boats belonging to Tamil Nadu and Karaikal fishermen. On August 17, a nine-member team of fishermen leaders and a boat mechanic along with fisheries department officials travelled to Sri Lanka by flight and visited the jetties where these boats were moored. The team took stock of the condition of the released boats and assessed methods to bring them back.
 
 Out of the 42 boats, 36 could be towed back to the country, said B Jesuraja, a fishermen leader at Rameswaram who was part of nine-member team that visited Sri Lanka in August.
 
 In the first phase, seven boats – six from Rameswaram and one from Mandapam – will be salvaged. “Our team will tie the boats with trawlers and tow them back here. Once they return, we will take out repair works. Each boat may require at least Rs 3 to Rs 4 lakh to be seaworthy again,” Jesuraja stated.
 
 Officials said the team has reached Karainagar on Wednesday evening and will return either on September 29 or 30.
