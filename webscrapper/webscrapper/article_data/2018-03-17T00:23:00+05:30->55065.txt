Cleared/250 Words Kanyakumari: A 24-year-old woman who went missing from a Sri Lankan refugee camp in Kanyakumari was killed in an accident in Delhi on March 13. Police sources said that B Ramya from the refugee camp at Perumalpuram in Kanyakumari district had completed her beautician course and was working in a beauty parlour here. Police quoting her family as saying said that she did not return from work on January 9. A search launched by her relatives went in vain and a police complaint was lodged. While there was no news from her, on March 13 (Tuesday) five people, including Ramya were killed in a road accident in Delhi. Police tried to get in touch with her family based on the contact details found on her identity card. Since it stated that she hailed from Chennai, they sought help from the Chennai city police, who found that the address was incorrect. Further investigations revealed that she was from the refugee camp here and her body was sent to Kanyakumari district. It is now preserved at the Asaripallam Government Medical College and Hospital. Police are trying to figure out the mystery behind her disappearance and how and when she went to Delhi and the reason for her providing a wrong address. Intelligence agencies too are conducting a parallel probe into the incident as inmates of the refugee camp are supposed to inform the Q branch or the local police if they are going elsewhere even in case of an overnight stay.
