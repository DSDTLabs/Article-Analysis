 Addressing among the 5,000 college students, Radhakrishnan said saffron colour is not the symbol for Hindus but the nation. “Sister Nivedita was the best disciple of Swami Vivekanda. She worked for the people for 13 years and worked for women’s education.

 Actor Vivek said former President APJ Abdul Kalam, the superstar of all youths of the nation, accepted Swami Vivekananda as his mentor.

 “Sister Nivedita is known for her social activities. She gave importance to the women’s education and loved India. The younger generation should know about sister Nivedita and the rath yatra will teach them about her,” said Vivek.
