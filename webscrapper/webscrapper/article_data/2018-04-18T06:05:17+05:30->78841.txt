 On Monday afternoon, Saylee Rajput, a resident of Kandivli, was visiting Girgaum Chowpatty with her friend Rashmi. Around 2.45pm, Rashmi called Saylee’s father Arjun to inform him that his daughter had met with an accident while crossing the road near Tarapurwala Aquarium and had been rushed to Nair Hospital. Arjun, who works with a private laboratory in Borivli, rushed to the hospital only to learn that Saylee had died due to severe head injuries. On March 24, Nair Dental Hospital intern Dipali Lahamate had met with a similar accident on the same stretch. She died six days later.
 
 Prasad, who sped away without offering help to Saylee, surrendered before police late on Monday. “Prasad told us that he was not at fault as the signal was not working.

 Police are scanning the CCTV footage of the accident spot, said Vilas Gangawane, senior inspector, Marine Drive police. Prasad, a resident of Mount Mary in Bandra, told cops that he had taken a car out for a test drive to Nariman Point. He was returning to Prabhadevi when the vehicle hit the girl at Marine Drive.
