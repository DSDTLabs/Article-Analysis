BEIJING: China reported another 8 fatalities from   since mid-February, the government said, taking the death toll so far this winter to at least 108 and stirring further concerns about the spread of the deadly virus.

 China reported as many as 79 deaths from the same virus in January, the government said.
 
 The   did not disclose the location of the fatalities or the infection rates.
 
  control experts have warned the public to stay alert for H7N9 avian flu, with the commission saying more than 340 cases of human infection have been reported since October. South Korea and Japan are also battling their own major outbreaks and have culled millions of chickens.
 
 The virus is likely to strike in winter and spring, and farmers have in recent years ramped up measures such as cleaning regimes to prevent the disease. China has confirmed five   outbreaks among poultry this winter, which has led to the culling of more than 1,75,000 birds.
 
 China, the world's third-largest producer of broiler chickens and the second-biggest consumer of poultry, has also closed some live poultry markets after people and chickens were infected by the avian flu strains.
