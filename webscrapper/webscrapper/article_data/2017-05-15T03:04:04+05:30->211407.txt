NAGPUR: Coming to the rescue of a wife, who is now a  , the   asked her 61-year-old husband, to increase her   of from Rs2,000 to Rs3,000, which he pays from his pension.

 The   in 1976 and was separated in 1990. The husband started paying a monthly maintenance of Rs500 since 2002, after the wife moved to the family court. Though she filed petition for grant of maintenance in 1996, it took six years for the family court to decide on it. In the meantime, the husband, who was working with one of ordnance factories, retired.
 
 In 2005, she filed an application for enhancement of maintenance contending that she was unable to maintain herself with the partly maintenance of Rs500 and husband’s salary was also hiked. Partly allowing her plea, the family court directed the man to pay Rs1,500 monthly from April 2009.
 
 She again filed new case in 2011 seeking monthly maintenance of Rs5,000/month, which was partly allowed by the family court on July 10, 2013, asking the husband to pay Rs2,000/month to her. The court, however, rejected her claim for paying Rs25,000 to her for preparing a medical card. 
 
 The wife challenged this decision of July 10, 2013, with same prayers arguing that the prices of essential commodities have skyrocketed. She added that the husband had received arrears after implementation of sixth pay commission. She justified the hike stating that she is an old woman suffering from health problems.
 
 A division bench comprising justices Vasanti Naik and Swapna Joshi observed that the man was working on a petty post and is retired on attaining the age of superannuation. “When the case was being heard by the family court, the respondent was earning Rs9,075 towards monthly pension. Considering the fact that he is also a retired person the lower court directed him to Rs2,000 per month to wife,” they said.
 
 The judges, however, clarified that they wouldn’t like to enhance maintenance from filing date of this appeal (in 2013) or from family court judgment (2011), as the husband is only a pensioner and it wouldn’t be possible for him to clear arrears at Rs3,000/month, as he is already paying Rs2,000/month to the wife.
 
 “Considering the fact that pension amount payable must have been increased during the past three to four years, we would direct the husband to pay Rs3,000/month to wife towards maintenance from January this year and continue to pay it regularly,” the judges said, while partly allowing wife’s plea.
