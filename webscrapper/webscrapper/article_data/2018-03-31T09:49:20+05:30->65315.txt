Jaipur: Twenty-two-year-old Anju Raman, third-year BA student at  , has written to Prime Minister   seeking help as her family has been evicted from the house. She is now forced to study for her examinations, beginning April 16, under open skies in blazing heat.

 “This is a state where the   is in power, and where a woman is chief minister. You yourself often raise the slogan of ‘beti bachao, beti padhao’. I hope you will intervene and allow me to continue my studies without fear,” the young Dalit girl has written in a March 28 letter in Hindi to the prime minister.
 
 Raman, her father Hiralal Bhairwa, her mother and two brothers sit watching over their furniture, which was thrown out on March 12. Bhairwa told TOI, “I started out as a construction labourer in the 1980s. Over time, I became a contractor. I was given some land and told I could live there for three years. Even before this, I was given a plot a little away and constructed a house there. I was told to move from there, with no compensation, and we settled here some years ago. The house was part-payment for my work, and in the time that I have lived here, I have constructed walls and spent over Rs2 lakh on it. Now, even the little money that we had saved has been stolen ever since we were evicted.”
 
 In February, to forcibly evict the family, the landlord, Dhiraj Yadav, a teacher at the   in Tonk district, first got the electricity and water connection cut. He then roughed up one of Bhairwa’s sons, in a bid to terrorize the family. TOI could not reach the accused on phone.
 
 Bhairwa says, “The accused is a Yadav. Even the police personnel in our local police station are all Yadav. They are close-knit and aid each other.”
 
 ACP Desraj Yadav said, “This matter is currently under investigation, and it will be decided in due course.”
