Gurgaon: Buyers of flats in the Universal Aura project in Sector 82 took out a protest on Tuesday against the developer for delay in handing over flats.

 More than 50 people held banners and posters in front of the DTCP office in Sector 14 and shouted slogans against developer   Private Limited. They claimed they have already paid almost 80% of the price, but are yet to get the possession of flats.
 
 The Universal Aura project was launched in 2010. Spread over 11 acres, it is likely to have 596 units across 11 towers, each costing between Rs 53 lakh and Rs 1 crore. The developer had promised to complete it by 2014. But till date, only 50% of the work has been completed.
 
 Buyers alleged work at the site had stopped around two years ago, and the developer had stopped responding to queries. 
 
 “The builder collected 80% of the cost from buyers till June 2014, but stopped construction two years ago. With no progress at the site, we’re unsure when we’ll get possession,” said Dhiraj Kumar, a homebuyer
 
 Buyer’s association general secretary   said: “Licence for the project expired in June 2015, and was not renewed, which is a must to restart construction.”
 
 Assistant town planner (ATP) R S Batth said the developer had been directed to submit tower-wise completion plans and progress report within 10 days. “The department will inspect the site to take stock,” said Batth, adding the department would make efforts to ensure timely completion of the project.
 
 Pooja Sharma, legal head of Universal Buildwell, refuted the allegations, holding the buyers responsible for the delay instead. “Buyers formed an association to put unnecessary pressure on the developer, and even filed a complaint with the national consumer forum, which caused delay,” she said. “We’re ready to pay the delay penalty (at Rs 15/sq ft per month) at the time of handing over possession.”
