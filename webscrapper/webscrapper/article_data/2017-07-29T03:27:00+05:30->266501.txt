Mapusa: A delegation of the Mapusa Merchants Association, led by Ashish Shirodkar, complained to the Mapusa municipality about the slow pace of drainage repair work in the market area on Friday.  Shirodkar said that the municipality had opened up some of the drains in the market for disilting during the monsoon. The market is already suffering from waterlogging. He said that the opened drains and the silt from the drains which has been lying unintended for about three weeks now is emanating a foul smell affecting vendors, merchants and customers.  “The work is being undertaken at the wrong time and moreover it’s being carried out at a snails pace. There are daily incidents of people falling in the open drains because it is very difficult to identify the open drains when the market gets flooded,” association president Shirodkar said.  Sources said that MMC still continues to undertake construction of cross drains and drains in the Mapusa market and has kept drains opened on both sides of the road causing inconvience to people visiting the market. MMC is of the opinion that these new drains will solve the flooding problem in the market. Shirodkar said that the contractor has opened the drains and has also dug up a huge cross drain at the entrance of the market from KTC bus stand. Due to heavy rains the drains are flooded with water.  Sources said that the MMC is spending around Rs 15 lakh for construction of the 110m drains. Shirodkar said that the chief officer has assured the delegation that work will be completed within a week’s time.
