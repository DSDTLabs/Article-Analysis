NASHIK: Minister of state for defence   on Saturday said the government is using every possible means and exerting ‘all kinds of pressure’ on Pakistan to secure the release of  .

 Bhamre maintained that Pakistan is not cooperating with the Indian agencies trying to provide consular access to Jadhav, who has been arrested on charges of spying. “We requested more than 20 times but Pakistan authorities are not allowing consular access to Jadhav. Because they know, if he is given proper assistance and hearing, the truth will come to fore and they will have to release him,” Bhamre said. 
 
 Bhamre was in   to attend a national summit of exservicemen, when he spoke to TOI on important issues related to defence ministry. Bhamre said the stone pelting incidents in Srinagar are part of Pakistan’s proxy war against India. “By misleading some youths in some colleges, Pakistan is trying to disturb peace in the entire Kashmir region. But, we are taking all necessary steps to stop the stone pelting. You will see positive results in next two months or even earlier,” he said. 
 
 According to him, the number of youths involved in stone pelting is very less, while those who want peace and progress of the state is more. “We must understand that some students from some colleges of Srinagar are involved in stone pelting and we are sure that these are also misinformed. I sincerely praise our soldiers posted in Kashmir for their patience,” he said.
