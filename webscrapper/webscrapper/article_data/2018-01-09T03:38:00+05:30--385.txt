Panaji: Animal activists, spearheading the crusade that has led to shortage of beef in the state, said on Monday that the “import of beef into Goa is illegal”. Meat traders are misleading people and the government is citing harassment by gaurakshaks, but the fact is that there is no facility in Belagavi for slaughtering cattle within the legal framework, animal activists said.  “It is false to say that the trade is legal, as there is no slaughter house set up in Belgaum, as per legal requirements. If there is one, please let us know,” said Hanuman Parab, president of Govansh Rakshya Abhiyan, when contacted by TOI.  Parab said that the quality of meat brought into the state is unhygienic and in a few raids they found maggots in it. The meat transported by railway also fails on this count, as it is packed poorly and not kept in refrigerators to preserve it during transit, he said. “Dead cattle are also slaughtered instead of live ones and the consumers are unaware about adverse impacts to their health by consuming such meat.”  Parab alleged that the state has a government-run slaughtering facility at Goa Meat Complex, Usgao, where slaughter “was being done without proper process of quality norms”.
