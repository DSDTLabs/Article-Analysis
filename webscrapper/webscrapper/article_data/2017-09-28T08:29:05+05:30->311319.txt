LUDHIANA: Four days after the mutilated body of an   sepoy was found near Akhara village in Jagraon, Ludhiana (rural) police claimed to have cracked the case with the arrest of his fiancée, her paramour and their associate. 

 The accused have been identified as Satnam Singh’s fiancée Rajwinder Kaur of Aalewal village, Ferozepur, her cousin and paramour Pardeep Singh of Bhamipura village, near Jagraon, and his accomplice, who is a minor. The police have also recovered two sharp-edged weapons and a motorcycle the accused used in the crime. 
 
 Ludhiana range deputy inspector general (DIG)   said, “While Rajwinder plotted the murder, Pardeep and his minor accomplice executed it. Satnam’s call details helped nail the trio, who have confessed to the crime.” 
 
 The police said Satnam got engaged to Rajwinder a few months ago. “But Rajwinder wanted to marry her cousin Pardeep. Rajwinder, along with Pardeep, even tried to break her engagement with Satnam. When all their efforts failed, they decided to eliminate Satnam,” the DIG added. 
 
 On September 23, Pardeep called Satnam to Jagraon, saying he wanted his advice to get recruited in Indian Army. Pardeep and his minor accomplice met Satnam at a juice bar in Jagraon where the former made him drink juice laced with sedatives. After he lost consciousness, the two took Satnam to the banks of Sirhind feeder canal and killed him with sharp-edged weapons, cops added. 
 
 Police said Satnam was brutally murdered. “His right ear was chopped off and there was a deep cut on his head. A blood-stained   and a pair of shoes were recovered from the  . A Chowkiman-to-Moga bus ticket was found in Satnam’s pocket,” a cop added.
 
 The body of Satnam, a resident of Bhagoke village in Ferozepur district, was found on the banks of Abohar branch of Sirhind feeder canal between Akhara and Dalla villages on September 23.
