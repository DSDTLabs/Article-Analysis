VISAKHAPATNAM: Demand for beer has shot up in the port city, thanks to the scorching heat. 

 According to the data compiled by the prohibition and excise department, nearly 7.8 lakh cases of beer were sold from April 2016 to March 2017 in the core city area from the airport to Old Diary Farm in Greater   Municipal Corporation ( ) limits. However, 1,00,045 cases of beer were sold only in April this year. 
 
 Based on the last year’s figures, the officials estimated the average beer sale in a month to be 65,000 cases. “Selling nearly one lakh beer cases in April clearly indicates that beer consumption has shot up in the city. This is due to the severe heat and high humidity levels prevailing in the city,” superintendent of the excise department V Sudhir said, adding that the core city area has nearly 91 bars and restaurants besides 67 wine shops. “The situation is the same this month as well. Nearly two lakh beer cases have been sold from April to May 22, which was nearly 35 per cent more than the average sale,” he added. 
 
 Meanwhile, consumers complain that many shops do not sell premium brands and adhere to the MRP. “I visited several shops in the last one week, but none of them had   beer. As a result, those who keep such brands charge exorbitant prices,” said P Rushikesh, a BPO employee. Speaking to TOI, assistant commissioner of excise SVVN Babji Rao admitted that there is a shortage of premium brands in the city and said it was due to low supply from Telangana.
