The cloud over Eman Ahmed’s discharge from Mumbai’s   failed to lift on Monday.

 The authorities of Saifee Hospital, where Eman — once dubbed the world’s heaviest woman at 500 kg — lost 300 kg after  , said that nobody from VPS Healthcare,  , visited or contacted them to oversee the arrangements to fly the Egyptian national to Burjeel Hospital, where her treatment will continue. Burjeel Hospital is part of the   Group.
 
 In fact, Eman’s doctor Muffazal Lakdawala himself enquired about Eman’s discharge from her sister Shaimaa Selim on Monday. Dr Lakdawala and Shaimaa, who were no longer on talking terms after the spat over Eman’s release turned ugly with the hospital administration even filing a police compliant against her for making Eman drink water, spoke for the first time after 20 days.
 
 Shaimaa, who had accused Dr Lakdawala and Saifee Hospital of abandoning Eman and hastening her release, told Mirror, “I have not received any information from VPS, I am hoping that they will revert to me on Tuesday.”
 
 
  
 
 The doctor has also reportedly requested Shaimaa to see to it that Eman didn’t undergo any further surgery at Burjeel Hospital as it might be risky for her.
 
 Hospital staff, however, said that Dr Lakdawala was left disappointed and sad when Eman refused to greet him when he went to see her and Shaimaa on Monday.
 
 “Eman used to always smile whenever she saw Dr Lakdawala. But today (Monday), she didn’t react on seeing her doctor. Eman just refused to smile. She even turned her face away,” said a hospital staffer.
 
 Eman, who currently weighs 176.6 kg, will fly in business class in a normal flight to Abu Dhabi. Shaimaa had earlier told Mumbai Mirror that Dr. Shamsheer Vayalil, managing director of VPS Healthcare, has offered Eman one-and-a-half-year stay at Burjeel Hospital hospital. She wants Eman’s physiotherapy to continue there as it is closer to home in Alexandria.
