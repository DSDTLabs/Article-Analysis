JAIPUR: The Sisodia Rani Bagh at the Ghat ki Guni on Agra bypass is set to get a music museum. The Department of Archaeology & Museums has floated a tender inviting private participation to open and operate the museum. The   is likely to be inaugurated in a month.

 According to sources, “The palace is a beautiful example of architecture and the addition of the museum should add to its existing charm. More than 50 musical instruments and sculptures will be on display in this one of its kind museum in the state. These will represent the musical culture of   and represent its legacy with instruments like Sarangi, Ektara, Khartal, etc., that would be on display. The museum is likely to be an additional attraction for music lovers showcasing the rich heritage of the state with music, in the coming tourist season”.
 
 The   and Palace derives its name from the queen for whom it was built and is a palace garden located at Ghat ki Guni. It was built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in 1728 and consists of tiered multi-level gardens with fountains, watercourses and painted pavilions. A double-storeyed palace occupies the top terrace of the garden. The palace also has many galleries, pavilions and beautiful murals depicting scenes from the life of Lord Krishna. It is located on the Jaipur-Agra highway.
 
 But the project even before starting has attracted criticism and this is not the first time the idea has been floated.
 
 Proposals to have such a museum were made in the past too, but they never materialized. “Another wonderful property, Sisodia Rani Palace and Garden is being given away by the government to private party to open a musical instruments museum. Government should reconsider its decision. By installing musical instruments, the walls and facade of the palace will be ruined. The palace, which is a fine example of architecture, will be ideal for   to entertain foreign tourists and arrange conferences to boost tourism in the state,” said Rajvir Singh Dundlod.
