 A bench of Justice Sanjay Kumar and Justice Anis, before whom the matter came up for hearing on Monday, sought counters from AP, Telangana and Somesh on the Centre's plea and posted the case to March 6.
 
 Earlier, the CAT had set aside guidelines prepared by the central committee as it was sceptical about the presence of former AP chief secretary P K Mohanty in the committee. The Centre had then argued that if the tribunal allowed petitions of individual officers, it would open a Pandora's box and the gigantic task of cadre division between AP and Telangana would never be completed. But the tribunal brushed aside the argument and had ordered retention of Somesh in Telangana.
