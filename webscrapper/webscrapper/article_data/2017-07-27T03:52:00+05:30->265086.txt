Porvorim: A day after former St Cruz MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate joined Goa Forward Party (GFP), town and country planning (TCP) minister Vijai Sardesai said that his party “will not split the Congress any further”. 

 Trying to ward off allegations that he was trying to bring down the government while Chief minister Manohar Parrikar was out of the country, Sardesai said, “We have faith in each other (with BJP). There is stability in the government. 
 
 “The problem with the Congress is that its leaders are not serious. It’s suffering from policy paralysis,” Sardesai said. Sardesai, who rose to speak on congratulatory motion on Vinay Tendulkar being elected to the Rajya Sabha, took his time to criticize Congress leaders even as opposition leader Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar and Congress leader Pratapsing Rane objected to his behaviour. tnn
