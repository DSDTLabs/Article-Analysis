TIRUPUR: After Chennai, it was the turn of   to table its 2018-19 budget shrouded in secrecy. To start with, the corporation authorities released the budget much ahead of the scheduled time.

 The civic body did not give a copy of the budget book to reporters stating that it did not print enough number of books. They were just given a ‘summary’ with bare minimum details of the financial discipline of the corporation.
 
 While most of the city corporations have presented their budgets, the dollar city corporation presented its own only on Wednesday. Prior to it, its public relations department informed the reporters that the meeting on budget would begin at 1pm. But, the civic body preponed the meeting by one-and-half hours. It was not even informed to some of the mainstream media reporters.
 
 The budget which was presented without the presence of the council for the third straight year was released by the corporation commissioner M Ashokan at his chamber. The event lasted only for few minutes, including his press meet.
 
 The reporters were not provided with budget booklet which the commissioner released, but a couple of white sheets printed with a summary of the budget. It did not contain enough details to analyze the budget.
 
 When reached, a senior official told TOI: “Since there were printing mistakes in the booklets, they could reprint only few booklets. So, they could provide the same only after 10 days.”
