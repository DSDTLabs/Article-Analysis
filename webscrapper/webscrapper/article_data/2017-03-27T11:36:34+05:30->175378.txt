PANAJI:   locals held a morcha in the village to create awareness about the threat to the century-old   and also held a demonstration at the SAG’s Athletic Stadium at  , on Sunday.

 Waving placards, a group of villagers stood outside the stadium as Goa clashed with Bengal in the Santosh trophy final on Sunday evening. “We wanted to create awareness at the national level about our lake, which we have inherited from our ancestors,” local activist Arturo D’Souza said.
 
 A developer has carried out hill-cutting to lay a mud road on a steep gradient in the catchment area of the dam built during the Portuguese regime. Villagers allege that authorities have been lax in initiating action to stop the work.
 
 The villagers interacted with Benaulim   Churchill Alemao at the stadium and informed him about the threat to the lake. 
 
 On Sunday morning, St Cruz villagers held a morcha and called on local MLA Tony Fernandes, urging him to take up the issue with town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai. They also asked the MLA’s wife, Indira Fernandes, who is the sarpanch, to convene a special gram sabha to discuss the issue of the lake.
