VISAKHAPATNAM: The city’s greenery with its  , shrubs, bushes and trees, is definitely soothing for the eyes but a few experts believe that unless the hills are protected and developed into  , Vizag might run out of green space in the next decade.

 Although city and urban area administrators turned the roads and avenues green ahead of the  , Vivek Rathod of MEECONS-Vizag Chapter said, “The problem with Vizag is common to all quick growing cities. Thanks to the hills and valleys, places such as the zoo park, Kambalakonda  , Sita Konda, Animal Rescue Centre and Simhachalam hills provide green avenues. But the fact remains that this space is shrinking chiefly due to encroachments and ‘development’.”
 
 Rathod observed that city planners must first identify spots where they can develop or encourage natural green zones which can provide greater canopy cover. KS Patrudu, who worked for the soil conservation department in South Odisha, Telangana and north coastal AP as a field engineer, said, “The hills of Vizag should be used to develop native green species that help provide a great deal of canopy cover for most of the year and are also less expensive to maintain.”
 
 Patrudu observed that native species such as blueberry (neeredu) combined with margossa, mango, jumbo sapota, jumbo badam, badam, sweet tamarind, soapnut, custard apple, native timber trees, and jackfruit can be used along with jamun, custard apple and citrus trees. 
 
 Rathod said, “Planting native species will help promote and develop the local ecology and draw a number of birds and small animals back into the urban space apart from of course providing ample lungs to the residents of the city.”
