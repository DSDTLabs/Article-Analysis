 ‘Black Day’ observed in Mandya too
 
 Dubbing the JD(S)-Congress alliance an ‘unholy nexus’, BJP activists in Mandya gathered at the Sri Cauvery statue on the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway and raised slogans against leaders of the two parties. Chandagalu Shivanna, a BJP leader who unsuccessfully contested the assembly elections, said that Kumaraswamy assuming office of the CM was a ‘blot’ on democracy.
 
 “Power hungry leaders of the Congress and JD(S) are being condemned by the people, who are fed up with their abhorrent behaviour,” he said. “It is a mockery of democracy when BS Yeddyurappa, whose party has won 104 assembly seats, is forced to resign, and Kumaraswamy of the JD(S), which has won 37 seats, is forming the government with the help of the Congress,” Shivanna added.
 
 The protesters also lashed out at the Congress for ceding the CM’s chair to JD(S), and playing second fiddle. “The party that has 78 MLAs has sacrificed the CM’s post to the JD(S), and this ‘nautanki’ is just to keep BJP out of power. But the BJP received the blessings of the voters,” the protesters said.
