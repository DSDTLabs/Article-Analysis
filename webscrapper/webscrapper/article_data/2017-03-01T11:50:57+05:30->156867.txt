The celebration of the 14-year journey of interdisciplinary artist   at a city art gallery recently saw several known faces from the music, film and dance fraternity in attendance. Presented by Chaitali Dasgupta, the evening began with a performance by artist   from   who had sung for Peter Brook’s Mahabharata earlier. Educator and author   spoke in praise of Sujoy’s work in the area of gender and sexuality. 
Pramita Mallick’s rendition of Rabindrasangeet Aamader khepiye beraye je was especially dedicated to Sujoy for his contributions to art. Poet-lyricist Srijato and actor Arjun Chakraborty also read out their poems. Actress   mesmerised everyone with her reading of Bhaskar Chakraborty’s poem. She said, “It’s difficult to say no to Sujoyda for anything.” 
 Actress Chaiti Ghoshal stuck to Kabita Sinha’s poetry while Kamalika enthralled everyone with an Amrita Pritam poem in Hindi. The other performers for the evening were Jayati Chakraborty, Poulomi Bose, Prabuddha Raha, Paroma Banerjee and many others. Among the guests who came to congratulate Sujoy were Sudarshan Chakravorty, Alokananda Roy, Subodh Sarkar, Indranil Sen and Tulika Bose.
