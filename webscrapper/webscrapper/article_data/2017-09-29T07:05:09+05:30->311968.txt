PANAJI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state leaders, including chief minister  , starting September 26, are engaged in visiting constituencies across Goa, reconnecting with its booth-level karyakartas.

 Party general secretary Sadanand Shet   said the ongoing booth vistarak yojana is being used by state BJP leaders as an opportunity to connect through in person meetings with booth workers, at a time when mobile phones have limited one-on-one contact.
 
 “There are 1,642 booths across Goa, we will cover 100% booths from September 26 to October 31, though Goa has started the programme late due to state general elections, panchayat elections and Panaji bypolls. Our aim is to retain the bonding with the karyakarta. Due to mobile phones, the personal visits have reduced today by state leaders, as compared to the past. This is an opportunity to reconnect,” said Tanavade, who was on an   visit on Thursday.
 
 The programme has been scheduled in a manner where at least one state leader visits one booth on every day during the period of the booth visarak yojana. 
 
 While the CM will visit karyakartas in   and surrounding areas, former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar has been touring Pernem and surrounding regions. 
 
 Nationally, BJP leaders are observing the 100th birth centenary year of party ideologue  , of which the booth vistarak yojana is a part. The exercise is seen as a preparation for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
 
 “We admit that BJP’s biggest strength is the booth-level karyakarta,” he said
