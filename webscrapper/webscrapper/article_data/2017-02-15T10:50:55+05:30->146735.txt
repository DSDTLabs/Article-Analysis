The bureaucracy is once again in a state of flux following the split in the ruling  . While   has been chosen legislature party leader, the camp is divided between caretaker   and the convicted party general secretary V K Sasikala, compounding the crisis further.

 Tuesday's verdict upholding the conviction of Sasikala in the disproportionate assets case, however, brought cheers to much of the administration, after OPS's revolt against Sasikala's leadership put the stability of the government at risk.With none of the ministers backing OPS, save education minister K Pandiarajan, the corridors of power had been looking empty since last week.“The verdict gives clarity for the governor to decide the way forward to ensure political stability, which is a sine qua non for governance. It is a watershed in TN politics and hopefully in governance,“ said a senior IAS officer.
 
 The machinery has been functioning in fits and starts since the 2014 conviction of the then chief minister Jayalalithaa by a Bengaluru special court. A few influential officers at the helm called the shots, pursuing their independent agenda.
 
 “Need to quickly get back to better and honest governance, a caution to all in the executive,“ a senior official said. Panneerselvam did raise expectations with his pro-active governance in the last two months.Bureaucrats said they could get files cleared easily by the CM, and the discussions and review meetings turned out to be always cordial.
 
 “With so much of public support, hope Panneerselvam gets to be the chief minister so that he can aim at clean governance. He had raised the expectations of the people and he should not let them down. Any other proxy by Sasikala would mean her rule from prison.Hope OPS gets necessary support from legislators,“ an IAS officer said.
