PUNE: Windblown  ,   and industrial units are the top three contributors to air pollution, specifically in terms of particulate pollutants PM10 and PM 2.5, in the city. 

 Indian Institute of tropical Meteorology (IITM) experts said construction-related or wind-blown dust was one of the major contributors to pollutant PM10 in the city. “Vehicles contributed close to 42% of PM2.5 emissions in 2015 in the Pune metropolitan region. The share of other sources such as suspended dust is 33%,” an IITM source said.
 
 The IITM’s annual pollution data for Pune showed a 70% rise in terms of PM2.5 concentration in 2017 from what it was five years ago. Fresh data from   revealed that the months of January, February, March, April, October, November and December 2017 saw the highest pollution at Nal Stop and Swargate when the PM 10 levels were taken into account. 
 
 “Primary particulate matter includes wind-blown dust such as road dust, fly ash and soot. PM10 can be formed by physical processes of crushing, grinding and abrasion of surfaces. Mining and agricultural activities are some of the sources of these large sized particles,” said  , sub-regional officer of MPCB, Pune-1.
 
 Shinde said vehicles are the second major source of PM10. “Steps to be taken for ambient RSPM levels are implementation of stricter vehicle emission norms and commensurate fuel quality, use of cleaner fuels and banning of diesel driven vehicles. The reason for the high particulate matter levels could be vehicles, engine gensets, small-scale industries, biomass incineration and commercial and domestic use of fuels,” he said.
