CHENNAI: Southern Railway has placed the on-duty station master and loco pilot who was at the wheel of the  , whose engine and three coaches derailed on Monday morning.

 Preliminary enquiry showed that the loco pilot crossed the signal when it was red and the station master also gave a wrong oral message for the   to proceed, which caused the accident.
 
 Station master doesn't have the powers to give an oral instruction, the source said. However it is also likely that there was a signal failure and the blame might fall on the   (SnT) department after the enquiry was completed, the source said.
 
 The preliminary enquiry also shows that there was a `no route' signal and a gap in the track which led to the derailment.
 
 In layman's terms, the track was not in position to take either right or left curve, despite which the   pilot moved and caused the derailment.
 
 No passengers were injured in the accident.
