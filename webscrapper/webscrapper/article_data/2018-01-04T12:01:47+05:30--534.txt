LUCKNOW: Police teams working on   believe that the   called ‘Pardi’ is behind these incidents.

  is a   originally from Madhya Pradesh. Its members have also settled in other states. The gang is known for targeting houses located near peepal trees.
 
 Police are investigating dacoities in   (Chinhat) of December 25, another dacoity of May 8, and another of May 30 in Gomtinagar. Similarities between them and some dacoities of the past have led to the police’s suspicions.
 
 Gomtinagar circle officer Deepak Kumar Singh said that all the targeted houses were near dense thickets and had a peepal tree in the vicinity.
 
 Pardi gang targets only such houses. Its members come in SUVs and do not kill anybody during a loot.
 
 “They use weapons for breaking gates and windows of houses,” said Singh. The gang leaves the area after a loot and goes back to villages to lie dormant for some months.
 
 Because some Pardi gangs have strong base in Madhya Pradash, a police team will be sent to MP, too, said In September, UP STF had arrested six members of the tribal gang after a robbery in the house of a former Army officer near SGPGI in May.
