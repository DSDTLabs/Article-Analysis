VIZAG:   grins when he is reminded of his debut Test match against Australia in 2013. Dhawan smashed a sensational 187 off 174 balls to announce his arrival at the international level. India went on to drub Australia 4-0 in that series.

 Four years later, Australia are back and have been on top of their game to be on level 1-1 with the deciding Test match going on at Dharamsala.
 
 Dhawan, who struck a hundred on Saturday to signal his return to form at Vizag in the Deodhar Trophy, said he "didnâ€™t expect" Australia to come up with such a performance here in India.
 
 "I didn't expect them to fight like this. I think India must have been a bit surprised with the way the Aussies have fought this series. But they prepared and came back amazingly in the second Test in Bengaluru," Dhawan told TOI.
 
 The 31-year-old southpaw backed the Indian team to clinch the fourth Test and seal the series. "I think India have a good chance to win the match having bowled Australia out for 300 on day one. Aussie batsmen must have been in trouble with  's action. It's not that easy to play that kind of a bowler.
 
 "Pujara and Saha were amazing in Ranchi.  , Ashwin and Jadeja have been doing well. I back our boys to win the series. They know their job pretty well, so they are going to do it," he added.
 
 On his batting, Dhawan said he has been working on his technique. "I knew I was playing good in the domestic season, but just that I wasn't getting big runs. I keep my basics strong and worked on my technique. I spent good time with Laxman bhai taking his guidance and then with the Indian team, I worked with  .
 
 "I just want to perform as much as I can in this tournament, then I have IPL coming up. If I perform, things will automatically change for me. I don't worry much about the combinations. Once I perform, then my place will come automatically. That's how it is. If you keep things simple, then you have the clarity," he added.
