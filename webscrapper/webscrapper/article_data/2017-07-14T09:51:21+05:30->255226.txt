PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The gram panchayat of Maan, located near   in  , will start construction of a new crematorium for Gawarewadi villagers in a month, deputy sarpanch of the village Sandeep   said.

 Sathe said the villagers have performed around 50 cremations on the road for the past three or four years. He added that the state government has allotted six guntha (6,000 sqft) of land for a new crematorium. “However, the original land owners have not been allowing the gram panchayat to construct the facility for the past two and half years.” 
 
 Angry villagers cremated a body on the road near Hinjewadi IT Park on July 7 as they have no crematorium. The land for the old crematorium was acquired by state government for the IT park. Initially, people continued to use the old crematorium for a few years as the IT industries had not come up in that area.
 
 But in the past three years, a large number of industries have developed due to which the villagers are not allowed to cremate bodies at the old spot. 
 
 The   gave actual possession of the plot on Wednesday, he added. Speaking to TOI, an MIDC official, said, “We made the markings and handed over the plot to the gram panchayat. They have to build the crematorium as per their requirement and also bear the expenditure. We have given the compensation to the original land owners three years ago so they must not oppose the construction of the crematorium.”
 
 “The gram panchayat will prepare a design of the crematorium after seeking suggestions from the local people. Later, it will also prepare the estimated cost, invite bids for the crematorium construction and select the contractor. We want to complete this process at the earliest. There will be no dearth of funds for the project,” Sathe said.
