Chennai: The northeast monsoon may have come and gone but, the Met office on Monday said, a weather system over the Bay of Bengal is likely to result in rain in parts of the city from Tuesday through Wednesday.

 It said light to moderate showers are likely across the state on Tuesday.
 
 The city has not received significant rain since November, recording a mere 65mm in December against a monthly average of 180mm.
 
 As per India Meteorological Department (IMD) norms, the October-December is the northeast monsoon season. “But, it is not unusual for the monsoon to extend into January, as this is a La Nina year,” said Pradeep John, a private weather blogger. LA Nina is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that causes the sea surface temperature to fall below normal by 3 degrees C to 5 degrees C. 
 
 The city on average gets less than two days of rail in January, as per the climatological table (1981-2010).
 
 Area Cyclone Warning Centre director S Balachandran, confirming the formation of a low pressure area over southwest Bay of Bengal, said, “The temperature in northern TN, including Chennai, is likely to fall by a degree or two.”
 
 Fishermen have been advised not to venture out to sea as coastal areas are likely to experience gusts of wind at speeds between 45kmph and 55kmph .
 
 Kuzhithurai in Kanyakumari recorded 2cm of rain on Monday; the rest of the state remained dry. 
 
 The city received 5mm of rain in January last year against an average of 25mm. The city in 2008 recorded the most rainfall for the month in the past decade, at 50mm; the all-time record is 244mm (1915). January 2013 was a completely dry month.
 
 Chennai on Monday recorded a maximum temperature of 29.1C (normal) and a minimum of 19.6C (1C below normal).
