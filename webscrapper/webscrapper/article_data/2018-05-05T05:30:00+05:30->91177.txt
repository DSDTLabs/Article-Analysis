Chikkamagaluru: A tweet by Gujarat MLA   around 5.19 pm on Thursday following the registration of an FIR against 18 people including him and actor Prakash Rai for alleged violation of model code of conduct (MCC) resulted in a full-blown war of words between   police and the lawmaker.

 It all started with Chikkamagaluru city police registering the case against 18 people for organizing a meeting between 3.45pm and 6pm on Thursday, though permission for the same had been denied.
 
 Following the FIR, Mevani tweeted, “One more childish attempt to silence our voice. Me and Prakash Rai not allowed to speak at Chikkamagaluru for reasons best known to saffronized police of Karnataka. Fact that they can’t ignore us indicates that BJP is scared of citizens who raise real concrete issue like jobs”.
 
 Making it clear that police had no role in denying permission to his event, SP K Anna Malai regretted that Mevani was questioning the professionalism of Karnataka police and hoped that Mevani would show more maturity in his public reaction.
