GURUGRAM: A 22-year-old street vendor was shot at by three bike-borne men in the outskirts of   on Sunday. Police said they have identified the men and have started probing the matter which appears to have stemmed from a fight between the two parties.

 According to police, Vijay, a resident of Valmiki mohalla, was returning from an alcohol godown carrying 3 crates at around 10.30am when the accused shot at him. He was hit by two bullets in the stomach. Vijay managed to run and hide inside a shop after getting hit in a bid to save himself. 
 
 After he was inside the shop, the accused, two of who were wearing helmets while one had covered his face with a cloth, fled the spot. The shopkeepers in the area took Vijay to a private hospital where he underwent surgery.
 
 An FIR was registered under Section 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (common intent), and sections of the Arms act of the IPC at the Badshapur police station. Cops recorded statements of Vijay’s relatives and several other people of his locality. 
 
 “We have identified two out of the three accused. We will arrest them soon,” said Vishnu Parshad, the SHO of the Badshapur police station.
 
 The cops, however, did not divulge the names of the accused, as the matter is still under probe. Police said that it appeared to be a “routine” shooting, and could be the work of unseasoned criminals.
