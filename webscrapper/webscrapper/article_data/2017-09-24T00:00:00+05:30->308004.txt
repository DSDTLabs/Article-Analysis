 will be acting in a psychological action thriller directed by   of   fame. Nayan will be playing the protagonist in this film, which is set in Chennai.Says Arivazhagan, “I have already done a horror thriller (Eeram), investigative thriller (Aarathu Sinam) and a medical thriller (Kuttram 23). I have always wanted to do a female-centric thriller and I felt that a psychological thriller would be apt to exploit the stardom of Nayanthara and present a different, hitherto unseen facet of her.” While he has let out that this will be a psychological thriller, the director says that there will also be a surprise element, which will be released at the time of the teaser’s release. 

 Nayanthara will have a pair for a portion of the film, but the script did not demand a hero, adds Arivazhagan. The film is being planned as a Tamil-Telugu bilingual with Thaman scoring the music. His regular team of cinematographer KM   and editor VJ Sabu are likely to be on board as well. 
 
 The director informs that he is currently scripting the film and they are yet to finalise the rest of the cast. “The pre-production work will take at least three months. We have planned to have a photo shoot by December. Once Nayanthara gives her exact dates, we might start shooting from December-end or in January 2018. We are planning to wrap up the shoot in 45 days,” he says.
