BENGALURU: Faced with shortage of officials for poll duty, election authorities in Benglauru are scouting for more manpower.

 With the voter-verified paper audit trail ( ) system being deployed at every   this time, Benglauru requires about 55,000 personnel for election duty in its assembly constituencies. During 2013 polls, around 35,000 personnel were put on the job.
 
 BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad, the electoral officer for the city, said as of Monday, participation of 35,000 personnel from the civic body and other government departments has been confirmed. The remaining requirement will be met by roping in employees from public sector undertakings like   and  .
 
 “Public sector employees used to be deployed as microobservers. But this time we will need them at the booths to oversee voting,” said another BBMP official.
 
 Prasad said they’d need one person extra at each polling station because of the VVPAT system. Earlier, a minimum of four people were required at each booth.
 
 VVPAT is a facility where a voter can see a slip generated, recording his/her vote once it’s cast. The system will allow voters to raise queries in case of election fraud.
 
 Following a co-ordination meeting with police and civic officials, Prasad said they were in the process of tabulating staff data. “Apart from public sector undertakings, we will rope in staff from boards and corporations associated with the government. We have directed section heads of government departments to ensure we get a complete list of their employees. If there is any discrepancy in the listing, they will have to face notice,” he added.
