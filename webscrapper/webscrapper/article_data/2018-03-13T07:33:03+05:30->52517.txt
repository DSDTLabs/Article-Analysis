The first comprehensive report on credit to small businesses in India was released on Monday by the   (SIDBI) and Trans-Union Cibil. The report, which analyses repayment behaviour of all five million small businesses that have availed formal loans, shows that micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME’s) have much lower non-performing asset ( ) rates (8-12%) than large (16%) or mid corporates (15%). Specifically, MSMEs with exposure between Rs 10 lakh-5 crore have among the lowest delinquency rates.
 
 “This report has been created to provide data on small industries in a structured form to policymakers and lenders for intervention,” said  , chairman, SIDBI. “There are many states which have a large number of MSMEs, but credit is not available to them. Policy intervention is required because there are still 45 million MSMEs without access to credit,” he added. An interesting insight from the report is that as against Rs 77,000 crore of reported NPAs, there is Rs 8,000 crore of stressed loans and Rs 26,000 crore of loans where borrowers have been irregular in their repayments. This indicates that the stress in the sector is not fully recognised.
 
 “There has been an information asymmetry in this segment. Within the states and industries, quantitative knowledge of what is good and bad is not known to lenders because this kind of data was not hitherto available,” said  , MD & CEO, TU Cibil. Of the overall lending to commercial credit of over Rs 51 lakh crore, micro credit (loans below Rs 1 crore) account for only Rs 3.5 lakh crore, while SME loans (Rs 1-25 crore) add up to Rs 8.2 lakh crore. Within MSMEs, the Rs 10-50 lakh segment is growing at 17.1% and the Rs 50 lakh-1 crore has been growing at 15.6%. According to Pillai, after GST, four-lakh first-time borrowers took loans between July and December 2017. In the preceding six-month, only about 3 lakh new borrowers were added.
