MUMBAI: After rising up to 38.4 degrees   on Monday, maximum temperatures in the city dropped to 35 degrees on Tuesday. Weathermen said that it was the change in the   direction which led to this drop.

 As per the statistics on Tuesday the maximum temperatures recorded by the IMD Santacruz observatory was 35 degrees Celsius which was 1.7 degrees Celsius above normal. Meanwhile the IMD Colaba observatory recorded maximum temperatures of 32.2 degrees which was 0.2 degrees Celsius above normal. “On Monday it was the dry north-westerly winds which caused high temperatures. On Tuesday the wind pattern had changed to northerly,” said V K Rajeev from IMD Mumbai. 
 
 North-westerly winds are known to come from hotter areas like Kutch and Rajasthan.Another reason for the drop in maximum temperatures was also the fact that sea breeze had set in early. The relative humidity levels recorded continued to remain high. The humidity recorded at the IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatory was 89% and 73% respectively. The IMD has forecasted that maximum temperatures would remain around 35 degrees in the next 24 hours.
