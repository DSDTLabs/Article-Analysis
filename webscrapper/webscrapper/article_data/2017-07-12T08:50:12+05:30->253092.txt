HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad   on Tuesday stayed for 10 days the order of the single judge who sentenced Vijayawada sub-collector and municipal commissioner in a  . 

 Following a petition by Sheik Abdul Kalam Azad, the single judge had earlier restrained the authorities from interfering in his property. But the officials had levelled some area, including Azad’s land, for Krishna Pushkar arrangements. When Azad filed a contempt plea, the judge sentenced the commissioner and sub-collector to four weeks in jail. 
 
 On Tuesday, sub-collector Gummalla Srijana filed an appeal. AP’s advocate general Dammalapati Srinivas told the court that she had no role in the episode. In fact, the court order itself was not clear on who was responsible for the non-implementation of the order and the eventual levelling of the area. 
 
 The bench of Acting chief justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice T Rajani sought to know whether there was any dispute on the fact that there was violation of the court order. If you feel the sub-collector is not responsible, then tell us who is responsible, the bench said. 
 
 Upon repeated requests from the AG that the jail order is due for implementation and there was a need to stay it, the bench stayed the arrests for 10 days and asked the government to point out who was responsible.
