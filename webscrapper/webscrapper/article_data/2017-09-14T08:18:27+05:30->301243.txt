CHANDIGARH: In a huge embarrassment for the judiciary , the Punjab and   high court administration has recommended that an FIR be registered against its own registrar who was handling recruitment.

 The court put a harsh spotlight on its own inner functioning after the question paper of a preliminary exam for the recruitment of judicial officers in the   (judicial branch) was allegedly leaked. The high court has also ordered an FIR against two women candidates who were allegedly involved in leaking the paper.
 
 The high court has scrapped the exam held on July 16, 2017 for the selection of 109 subordinate judges in the Haryana judiciary. The decision was taken by the recruitmentpromotioncourt crea tion committee (subordinate judicial services) of the court. The issue reached court after one of the candidates knocked on its doors alleging that the seats for the exam were being sold for Rs 1.5 crore each and that many of the candidates had been selected even before the exam was held.
 
 The committee told the court that registrar (recruitment) Balwinder   and one of the accused  , had exchanged as many as 760 calls and SMSs between them in the past year.
 
 The committee on Wednesday submitted its report to the full bench of the high court, comprising Justice Rajesh Bindal, Justice   and Justice G S Sandhawalia. It recommended that Sharma be transferred out immediately and disciplinary action be initiated against him. The bench ordered the committee to inform the court about the action taken report on Friday .
 
 The bench ordered its registrar (vigilance) to direct service providers of the mobile phones of all those involved in the scam “to preserve the call details, messages exchanged and any further data available with them with reference to those telephones for a period of one year“.
