LUCKNOW: The Yogi government would take forward the previous Akhilesh government’s key project,   in Lucknow.

 The foundation stone for the institute’s radiation oncology block was laid on Thursday in Chak Ganjaria City.
 
 “Sarkar poora sahyog kar rahi hai. Yahan par aane wale marizon ko sab suvidhayen milni chahiye (the government is extending all help. Patients coming to this institute should get all facilities,” said minister for medical education Ashutosh Tandon after performing ‘bhoomi pujan’ for the block.
 
 Former CM   had laid the foundation stone of the project in October 2013. But only a part of the Rs 500-crore project was ready by 2016-end. The OPD services were started in the institute with the help of KGMU in November 2016.
 
 However, the work for the remaining project slowed down after the SP government was voted out in March last year.
 
 Chief medical superintendent of the institute Dr Desh Pal said: “The proposed radiation oncology block would probably be the first of its kind in India. It will have eight radiation bunkers for machines.”
 
 Executive registrar Dr   said the radiation facilities at the institute would be on a par with   in Mumbai.
