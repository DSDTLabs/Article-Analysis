MADURAI: The district police have introduced   which will help people in the nook and cranny of the district to bring their grievance to the notice of higher officers. At present, people from various parts of the district visit the SP office located at   in the city limits for the purpose. At least 200 people visit the office with grievances in a week. 

 While the practice of meeting the SP and airing their grievance in person will continue, the WhatsApp-enabled complaint system would spare people the trouble of travelling to the SP office and still reach the higher officers. 
 
 The new superintendent of police for Madurai district N  , who assumed charge 10 days ago, introduced the complaint facility on Wednesday. People can send complaints through images, videos, texts or speech through the WhatsApp number 77088-06111. District police say that the new system would help people get their complaint redressed with ease. The complaints would be brought to the knowledge of the district SP and tracked till the issue is sorted out. 
 
 Madurai city police have a Whatsapp-assisted system and an SOS app exclusively developed for this purpose. Manivannan said that on an average 40 persons visited his office a day from various places including remote areas. While they could continue to meet him, they need not travel all the way just to check the status of their complaint.
 
  “They can raise the issues through the app. The complaints would be brought to the notice of the officers concerned at the station level and to me as well. Two policemen have been allotted to watch the complaints round-the-clock. We will see that the complaint are redressed at the earliest,” he said.
