Jacqueline Fernandez, who admits she loves taking up challenges, enrolled for horse riding lessons at the Mahalaxmi race course last year. Her trainer, Suresh Tapuriah, is proud of his new student who has been consistently showing up for classes despite her hectic shooting schedules and is close to completing a year under his guidance.

  
  
 "Jacqueline has been busy travelling but whenever she finds time she loves being with the horses. She has enrolled as a member of the club and devotes a lot of time to the sport. She even helps promote it among her colleagues and friends. She usually trains for half an hour a day, twice or thrice a week. We have fixed training periods as the horses get tired after 30 minutes," Suresh told Mirror, recalling when Jackie's 'Reload' co-star   had tagged along for one of the classes. "Sidharth enjoyed the riding lesson but I guess most actors don't have the time to pursue training.  , Saif Ali Khan,   are the few who are members of the club."
 
 According to the ace trainer, Jacqueline's favourite horse is Golondrina, brought down from Argentina. "She is a well-trained horse and perfect for beginners", Tapuriah says. Jackie will skip some classes as she's now in London for a 40-day schedule of  's 'Judwaa 2', also features   and  .
