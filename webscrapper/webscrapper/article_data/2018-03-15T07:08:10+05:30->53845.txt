AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat assembly witnessed a hue and cry over the issue of tabling the Justice DK   report. The Government said the report is under scrutiny and will be tabled after the scrutiny.

 On July 5, 2008, decomposed bodies of Dipesh Vaghela (10) and Abhishek Vaghela (11), who were studying at Asaram's Gurukul, were found in mysterious circumstances on the banks of Sabarmati River, behind the Asaram Ashram in Ahmedabad. 
 
 Following agitation on the issue, the state government had in July 2008 set up the probe panel with retired Gujarat high court judge D K Trivedi as its chairman.
 
 The question on   commission report was raised by Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani. Mevani, during the question hour, said that the commission had submitted its report in July 2013. Minister of state for home, Pradipsinh Jadeja, said, “The government took such act seriously and seven people were also arrested by the police.” 
 
 He said that the commission was appointed in 2008 and the report has been received and is being scrutinized.
 
 When Niranjan Patel sought to know when the report would be tabled, Jadeja said that in the past several reports were not tabled by the Congress including that of the hooch tragedy in 1995, the report on the attack on Rathyatra and even the 1986 reservation stir.
 
 This led to a hue and cry in the house with the Congress protesting against the political statement. Leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani also made a political allegation. However, the speaker did not allow the LOP to raise the question. This political allegation again led to a hue and cry in the house.
