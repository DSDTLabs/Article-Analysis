 Meanwhile, the spokesperson of Aanand L Rai's Colour Yellow Productions stated, “We are currently in talks for the casting of Happy Bhag Jayegi Returns. Discussions are on but nothing has been confirmed so far."
 
 While speaking to Mirror earlier, Mudassar had revealed that he was working on another story when the idea of the sequel struck him last September. “I discussed it with Rai saab, who suggested I work on it some more. By October-end, I had a story which he really liked," he had said, adding that the essence of the film will remain the same, however, they are yet to zero down on the place where Happy will elope to this time. “Besides her runaway act, we also refer to the word `happy' as a state of mind which is not everlasting. I wasn't thinking of a sequel while making the first film, it was the encouraging feedback from the audience that set the ball rolling."
 
 While Mudassar had confirmed that the original cast including   and Piyush Mishra have been roped in for the sequel, Abhay revealed to Mirror that he may not be a part of it.
