VISAKHAPATNAM: All’s not well at the   located behind the office of Visakhapatnam district superintendent of police and   station. 

 Unsanitary conditions, absence of compound walls, lack of proper roads and fear of animals and snakes are common in the area that falls under the   assembly constituency.
 
 Garbage waste including plastic are dumped on the road itself. The roads and pipelines inside the quarters are faulty.
 
 “We have no compound wall in the quarters. Cattle, dogs and snakes enter our quarters. We keep our premises clean, but it will be better if the entire quarters is kept in a good condition with beautiful lawns and proper compound walls,” said a resident of the police quarters behind the SP office.
 
 NVRM Raju, assistant sub-inspector of police at One Town and president of Visakhapatnam City Police Welfare Association, told TOI that nearly 1,500 out of 4,000 police staff below circle inspector rank reside in police quarters. The police housing department has to release funds for maintenance and cleanliness of the quarters.
 
 “But, we are not getting any funds for maintenance for the quarters. The residents themselves collect the money and cleanl the area. Many buildings are in dilapidated conditions,” Raju said.
 
 T Gopal, treasurer of AP Police Welfare Association, said director general of police N   recently took a decision of identifying the quarters which were unfit for residing across the state. Maintenance is the main problem of these quarters faced mainly due to poor fund allocations, he said.
