The ‘Rangoon’ actor who’s pretty active on social media keeps charming his fans with pictures from his very special life. Selfies, pictures of his babygirl or just posts of his wife, 
  always has something for us. 

 This time around,   indulges in a little vanity at what appears to be in front of a make-up mirror. With ruffled hair, suggesting some wind in the air, Shahid captioned the picture, “Reflections”.
 
 
  
  
 Perhaps behind the scenes at a shoot or just enjoying the sun, we don’t know. But we like this view for sure!
 
 Shahid is currently working only on Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘Padmavati’.
