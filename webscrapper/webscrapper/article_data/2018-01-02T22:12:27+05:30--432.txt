 Ali tweeted, "What a trap this triple talaq bill is. Wow... and nobody is consulted? I am not a lawmaker and even I follow the Beebak Collective and other groups. At least discuss. You send the husband into jail by criminalising it. You are back to square one. The family is again abandoned! Not civil."
 
  
  
 The legislation, which has to be cleared by the  , criminalises instant divorce with three years of imprisonment for Muslim husbands. There is a provision for a subsistence allowance from the husband for the livelihood and daily needs of the wife and the dependent children.
