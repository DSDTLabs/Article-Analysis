MUMBAI: To stop unauthorised   activities by   in their clients' accounts, markets regulator   on Tuesday asked brokers to store all records of orders placed by   which are accepted in a court of law. These records include written documents signed by the client, recording of telephone conversations, emails from authorised email IDs, log for online transactions, SMSs or any other form of proof that is legally verifiable.

 “When dispute arises, the burden of proof will be on the broker to produce the above records for disputed trades,“ Sebi said in a notification. The new rules will come into effect on January 1, 2018.
 
 These guidelines have been put in place after Sebi found out that despite some measures taken by it, there were several investor complaints that pointed towards unauthorised trades by brokers. “It has now been decided that all brokers shall execute trades of clients only after keeping evidence of the client placing such order,“ the circular said. Sebi also said that whenever a client gives an instruction for trade on phone, the broker should “mandatorily use telephone recording system to record the instructions and maintain telephone recordings as part of its records“.
 
 At present, a system similar to the one Sebi is putting in place is applicable for trades in the commodity derivative markets.However, no such requirement is there in stocks, stock derivatives and currency derivatives markets. The regulator also asked the stock exchanges to implement these new rules and report compliance to it.
 
 There have been several instances where brokers, often to generate commission for themselves, trade in their clients' accounts without proper authorisation. At times, such trades lead to huge losses for the clients while at the same time generate brokerage fee for the broker. The regulator is trying to stop such practices.
