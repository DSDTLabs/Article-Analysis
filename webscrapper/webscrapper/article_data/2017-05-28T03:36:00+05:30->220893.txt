Panaji: With hardly any showers to provide relief from the summer heat and replenish the water table, the meteorological centre has recorded a shortfall of 59.0mm of rainfall during the summer season so far.

 The three-month summer season ends on Wednesday, May 31. The   has been largely dry for most part of the season with few showers and the total seasonal rainfall recorded is only 19.6mm. A seasonal total of 78.6mm is normal during the period.
 
 “The deficit in rainfall is due to lack of thunderstorm activity during summer,” director, meteorological centre, M L Sahu said.
 
 The met centre has forecast light to moderate rain or thunder showers at isolated places on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, but chances are remote.
 
 Though the mercury did not rise sharply throughout the summer and any surge above 35.0 C was restricted to a few occasions, the lack of occasional showers added to the discomfort.
 
 But, the bad news is that relief from showers is unlikely before the summer ends. “The chances of some showers during the next few days appear remote,” Sahu said. 
 
 The mercury has been hovering just over a degree above the normal range during day time. On Saturday, the meteorological centre at Altinho recorded a maximum temperature of 34.8Celsius, just 1.4 degrees above normal.
 
 But the minimum temperature was slightly higher, as met centre recorded 28.0C, 1.7 degrees above normal, but still in the normal range.
