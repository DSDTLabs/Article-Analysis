RANCHI: The stretch from   to   will be lined with  , clothes, shoes and snacks from 9pm till midnight from next week. 

 Khadi   - an after-dark weekend bazaar - will start on May 20 on a pilot basis in collaboration with Jharkhand State Khadi and  , the district administration and the traffic police department. 
 
 The state capital is trying to follow in the footsteps of like Delhi, Goa, and Rajkot where residents venture out after 9pm to enjoy their weekend. 
 
 Chairman of Jharkhand State Khadi Board, Sanjay Seth said, "Although our city has not fared well in the Swacch Bharat national ranking, we are still trying our best to improve the facilities offered for the benefit of the people. The residents of the city are otherwise unable to move out after 8pm as shop keepers close their shops for security reasons."
 
 "Since this is a new venture, we cannot start it simultaneously on all the streets of the state capital hence we have selected the stretch from Albert Ekka Chowk till Sarjana Chowk where residents can enjoy a bit of night life. 
 
 Vendors and artisans are looking at this project with alot of hope as they will become self-employed and earn some extra income when the Saturday night shopping bazaar comes into existence," Seth added.
 
 Adequate security arrangements have also been made for the safety of the residents who come out for shopping at night. "We have requested SSP Kuldeep Dwivedi and Traffic SP Sanjay Ranjan Singh to help us make our venture successful, so that residents can at least spend a few hours at night on the city streets without any fear," he said.
