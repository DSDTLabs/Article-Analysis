Literary   of all age-groups gathered recently at South Central Zone Cultural Centre to attend   and kavi sammelan titled Yaad â€“E- Mansha. Renowned poet Shams Jalnavi was the guest of honour of the evening that was organised to commemorate 94th birth anniversary of a well-known shayar Dr   Ur Rehman Khan aka Mansha. Audiences enjoyed a beautiful melange of poetry and satire by young and   poets in the old style. Needless to say, the venue reverberated with wah-wahs and thunderous applause.
