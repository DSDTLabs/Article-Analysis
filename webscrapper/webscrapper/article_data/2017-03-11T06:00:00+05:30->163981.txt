Ranchi: The All Churches Committee of Ranchi (ACCR) on Friday came out in support of   and heads of the Catholic Bishop’s Conference who had last week sought a moratorium on the Chhota Nagpur Tenancy (CNT) and Santhal Pargana Tenancy (SNT) Amendment Act.

 This comes in response to the criticism of Cardinal Toppo and other priests by some organizations after they met and placed their demand before Governor  . 
 
 Speaking to the media, ACCR chairman Rev. AK Ekka said, “Before being identified as Christian, bishops are bona fide citizens of the country and enjoy the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression… So condemning their move to meet the Governor and express their concern about the tribal community is unwarranted.” He described as “baseless and unacceptable” the allegations of “religious conversion and land-grabbing” against them.
 
 To drive their point home, ACCR members cited how the Maharashtra government on June 4 last amended Section 36A of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code to stop the purchase of tribal land by non-tribals merely on the basis of the permission from collectors. Such dealings cannot be done without the approval of gram sabhas, they added.
 
  The ACCR members alleged that the Jharkhand government has diluted the CNT and SPT Acts that protected the land rights of the tribals. “This is strange and disappointing that a tribal-dominated state is trying to transfer tribal land to others in the name of development,” Ekka said.
 
 The ACCR members said tribals are closely connected to land, water and forests and any attempt to alienate them from these things would amount to tampering with their life and culture. “If their land becomes a saleable commodity, the coming generations of tribals and original inhabitants will cease to have any claim over residential (local) certificates,” ACCR secretary Sunny Dahanga added.
