I love what I do and I work intensely. At home, I relax by catching up with friends. I seldom watch TV but I often get caught up in cricket no matter what time they are on. I also chill with TV shows like House of Cards or Billions.

 
  On the professional side, I derive great happiness and energy by solving tough business and organisational problems – even taking on tough meetings with customers. I also get energised when I can help others achieve their goals, which is something I prioritise at work, and in the community. In my personal life, I love travelling with my family to countries we’ve never been before, and immersing in new cultures.
 
 
 Work hard and play harder.
 
 
 Passionate and credible personal meetings can move mountains.
 
 
 Compromising our values. Integrity is everything.
 
 
  Be genuine and be bold.

 Success without complacency creates momentum, which breeds a string of other successes. Failure is also an opportunity to grow but failure without lessons learnt leads to dead-ends – less confidence.
