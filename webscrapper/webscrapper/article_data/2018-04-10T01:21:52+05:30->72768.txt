NEW DELHI:  , including three women, who posed as   and   to   many have been  . 

 The gang members — Mohammad  , Sanjay, Satvinder Kaur, Babita and Meenu — knew each other for quite a few years but had recently made this plan to cheat people. 
 
 “One of them used to honeytrap people, another posed as a journalist and one as a policeman,” said a police official.
 
 Kaur used to advertise about a spa that she was apparently running through WhatsApp and other social media platforms. She offered massages and friendship, and also gave her phone number with the message. When people contacted her, she made them get in touch with Meenu, who asked them to come to a particular address. 
 
 Police said before meeting a customer, they used to chat with them on social media. Babita too used to chat introducing herself as a member of the massage parlour. They used to invite the men to a house in   and asked them to take off all their clothes. 
 
 If the customer agreed, a man posing as a journalist and another as a policeman used to “raid” the house and record a video of the victim so they could blackmail him later. 
 
 “Sanjay alias   usually posed as a police officer. Samir Sadiq used to act like a mediaperson and in some cases posed as ACP Vijay Dahiya in front of the victims”, a senior police officer said.
 
 Sleuths from the crime branch busted the racket after they received multiple complaints. The five accused were produced before a magistrate on Sunday. Police said they are going through more complaints to ascertain the role of this gang in other such crimes.
