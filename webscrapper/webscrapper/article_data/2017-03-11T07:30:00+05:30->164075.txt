BENGALURU:   appealed to the   on Friday to intervene by directing the consortium of banks to negotiate with him and agree on an offer of a one-time settlement of all dues. 

 The former liquor baron, who has been residing in the UK since March last year after lenders and investigative authorities closed in on him over his alleged unpaid dues and fund diversion charges, had previously requested the banks for a one-time settlement only to be rebuffed. "Public sector banks have policies for one-time settlements. Hundreds of borrowers have settled. Why should this be denied to us?" Mallya said in a series of tweets in the early hours on Friday.
 
 Mallya, who was asked by United Breweries to step down from the position of non-executive chairman last month following an order from stock market regulator Sebi, said the "substantial offer" made from his side before the apex court was rejected by the banks without consideration. "Am ready to talk settlement on fair basis," he tweeted.
