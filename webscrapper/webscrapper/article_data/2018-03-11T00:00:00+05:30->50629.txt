It’s not only a moment of immense happiness and pride, but also a confidence boost when a debutant director lands his second project even before the first hits screens. That’s the case for director  , whose first film   (IPJ), which he is presenting under his banner, Riona Productions, is slated to release on March 16.
While IPJ explores human  , especially   and parental love, his next,  , deals with the power of human relationships, set against the backdrop of a political set up with a subtle message about the importance of giving back to society.
 Raghavanka explains, “The story revolves around a 35-year-old, simple, taxi driver Dharma, who chances upon a 10-year-old orphan Dhruva. The story captures their journey through all the happenings in society and how they become buddies for life. The film also explores the close bond between two people who are not related by blood.”
 The film, which will be a commercial potboiler, has action and song-and-dance integrated with the emotions that connect all the important characters. To be launched by the end of March or early April, the team plans to formalized casting for this film after the release of IPJ.
 Co-produced by Raghavana’s college buddy and biggest support system,   NK, shooting for Dhruva c/o Dharma is expected to begin in May, and will probably be released by the end of the year.
