AHMEDABAD: Dalits who were the victims of a ‘social’ boycott in Rantej village of   taluka of   district, on Wednesday said people from the   and BJP have been pressuring them to compromise on the issue and withdraw their police complaint.

 Amrut Rathod, the complainant in this case, on Wednesday said: “People from   of RSS and other BJP members have been pressuring them to withdraw their police complaint in the case.”
 
 “People of the upper castes issued a diktat in the village, to not give us milk or vegetables. People are not even ready to give us labour. When the police came to our village two days ago, they then gave us these essential commodities but the boycott continued after than,” Rathod said to reporters at the Ahmedabad district collectorate.
 
 The dalits in Rantej have been facing a social boycott for more than six days, after they refused to remove a dead cow from the village. The dalit community had decided to not dispose of carcasses when they were made to sit and dine separately at a religious feast.
