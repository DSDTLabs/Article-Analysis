HYDERABAD: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) got a backhanded compliment from former Union law minister and well-known   lawyer Kapil Sibal on the verdict given in the   case in Hyderabad.

 Mentioning that nine people were killed and 58 injured in the blast, Sibal on Tuesday tweeted: â€œNIA must be honoured for proving that there was no killer! Task well done! Desh badal chuka hai (The country has changed!)" .
 
 West Bengal chief minister   was also taken aback over the resignation of the special court judge after he delivered the judgment. "NIA judge resigned. What does this mean? Justice is silent. And are the accused golden?" she wondered.
 
 Hyderabad Member of Parliament (MP) and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader  , who had reacted to the acquittal of all the five accused saying that justice had not been done in the case, would speak out on the issue on Thursday.
 
 The MIM is organising a public meeting at Eidgah Dargah Ujale Shah, RH, Saidabad on Thursday at 7pm, where Owaisi might speak on the judgment. Apart from the MP, religious scholars of all sects would address the gathering
