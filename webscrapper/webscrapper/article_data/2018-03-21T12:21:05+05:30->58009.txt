COIMBATORE: The country has been lagging behind Japan and China in progress because of corruption, Tamil Nadu governor   said here on Tuesday.

 Addressing a gathering after inaugurating the   and Meditation Centre at   (KCT), Purohit said that rampant corruption over years have left the country struggling to realise the vision of excellence in all spheres.
 
 At the time of Independence, freedom fighters including Mahatma Gandhi had dreamt of India as a place where everybody was treated equal with no discrimination based on caste and religion, he said. “We got independence after a lot of sacrifice. Gandhiji and other freedom fighters wanted to make the country achieve excellence. But what is our position today? We could not realise that vision,” he said.
 
 Insisting the gathering to lead a honest and simple life, he said that if a person’s character was compromised, then everything would be lost in life. Stating that Tamil Nadu has the highest number of students pursuing higher education in the country, Purohit said that the state has been taking giant steps in higher education. “To make higher education more inclusive, more number of colleges was opened and several schemes were being implemented in the state,” he said.
 
 “In making education inclusive,   plays an important role in producing professionals with high technical knowledge, professional skills and ethical values. But, the students should not restrict themselves to bookish knowledge and examinations, but seek to take part in events that enlarge their vision,” he added.
