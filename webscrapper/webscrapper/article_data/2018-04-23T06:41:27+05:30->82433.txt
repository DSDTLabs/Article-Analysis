BENGALURU: Chief minister   is expected to face his toughest political challenge yet as the   is likely to field B   against him in   constituency in   district of north Karnataka.

 
 The BJP’s move to field Sreeramulu started doing the rounds within hours of the Congress announcing Siddaramaiah as its candidate from Badami, in place of Dr Devraj Patil, on Sunday.
 
 Siddaramaiah, who has filed his nomination from Chamundeshwari in Mysuru district, will file papers in Badami on Tuesday. The CM was believed to have chosen Badami in the face of a stiff challenge from JD(S) candidate GT Devegowda in Chamundeshwari.
 
 A senior BJP functionary said party leaders have held two rounds of talks with Sreeramulu to prepare him for the fight and asked him to be ready to file his nomination papers on Tuesday. Sreeramulu has filed nomination from Molakalmaru segment in Chitradurga district.
 
 Siddaramaiah is banking on the strong presence of Kuruba community in Badami. If Sreeramulu’s candidature becomes a reality, then the BJP will try to woo Lingayats and Valmiki Nayaka community members.
