Panaji: The state-run Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited (KTCL) will be extending its special services in the wake of ESMA for another day. On Friday, KTCL deployed its fleet of buses for citizens and tourists affected by the taxi strike by ferrying passengers to and from the airport and railway stations at Tivim,  , Vasco and Karmali.

 TOI had reported on January 18 that transport minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar had asked KTCL to keep their buses ready as a pre-emptive measure. KTCL authorities promptly instructed the individual depot managers to keep these buses available through the day. Buses from the Panaji, Margao and Vasco depots of KTCL plied buses to the airport, while several other buses plied from Karmali railway station to the Panaji bus stand, Tivim railway station to the Porvorim depot, Margao railway station to Margao bus stand and Vasco railway station to Vasco bus stand.
 
 “There were no problems. We had both shuttle as well as long buses on these routes. Some buses had up to 40 passengers, while one bus had the least number with nine passengers,” a KTCL staffer from the Panaji depot said. A similar response was reported from Margao and Vasco depots. “The passengers had understood the situation that there was a strike and were cooperative with us,” said a   staffer, Hussain Syed.
