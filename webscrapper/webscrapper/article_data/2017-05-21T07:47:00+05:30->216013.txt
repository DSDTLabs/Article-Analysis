GURGAON: One person was killed and another person seriously injured in a   incident in   over getting hit by a car on Saturday morning.

 Mahavir, a registered medical practitioner, who doubled up as a property dealer in Farrukhnagar was   when he had come to look at a property near Balaji Colony.
 
 Pappu Singh, Mahavir’s brother-in-law (wife’s brother), told the police that he had gone to Balaji Colony around 11am on Saturday along with Chhote, his brother-in-law (wife’s brother), his father-in-law Raghubir and Mahavir on two separate motorcycles.
 
 When the four reached Balaji Colony, they saw a white Safari car was parked on the way, and two people were sitting inside the car, Singh told the police. They stopped their bikes on the way, and decided to walk from there as there was no proper road.
 
 When Mahavir reached in front of the car, it suddenly moved and hit him. He fell on the road and suffered minor injuries. An altercation ensued between the two groups.
 
 The car driver, identified as Vikas, was apologetic and told them that he was just learning to drive, but Navin, Vikas’s friend who was in the passenger seat, was allegedly aggressive and got into an altercation with Singh and his relatives. As the argument escalated, Vikas telephoned his brother Ravi, who was in their house nearby. In no time, Ravi came to the spot with a pistol and started shooting at Mahavir. He was shot three times on his head. Navin tried to stop Ravi from behind, which apparently changed the angle of the gun and a bullet hit Vikas, Singh told the police.
 
 Mahavir was declared brought dead at a private hospital in Farrukhnagar. Ravi and Navin took Vikas to a private hospital, from where he was referred to a hospital in Sector 38.
