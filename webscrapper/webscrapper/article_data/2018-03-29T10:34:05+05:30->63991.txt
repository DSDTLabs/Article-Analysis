PATNA: City students opposed the decision of the   ( ) to re-conduct the examinations for economics (Class XII) and Mathematics (Class X), amid reports of an alleged paper leak. The board will, however, announce the dates for re-exams within a week.

 The maths exam was conducted on Wednesday (March 28) and the economics paper was held on March 26. Rumours of paper leak had been doing the rounds since March 5. Handwritten papers were allegedly being circulated on WhatsApp on March 25, a day before the economics exam.
 
 “The Board has taken cognisance of certain happenings in the conduct of certain examinations, as is being reported. With a view to upholding the sanctity of the Board examinations and in the interest of the fairness to the students, the Board has decided to re-conduct the examinations in the subjects,” a CBSE statement said.
 
 The paper leak rumours shocked many. CBSE city coordinator (Patna)   said, “Some negative elements are trying to defame the CBSE which is known to be the biggest and safest board of education.”
 
 Students were equally shocked and disappointed. Notre Dame Academy student  , who wrote the Class X maths exam on Wednesday, told this reporter, “The moment I stepped out of the examination hall, I was so happy and relaxed. But then I heard from teachers and parents that the paper had been cancelled and the CBSE would re-conduct the exam. This is disappointing.”
 
 Another Class X student Vipul Agarwal, who studies at St Michael’s High School, said, “Today’s paper was much easier than previous years’ exams. If there were rumours of the papers being leaked from Delhi, why are we being bothered?” he asked.
