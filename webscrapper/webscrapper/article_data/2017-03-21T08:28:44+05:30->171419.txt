ALLAHABAD: The   (AMC) on Sunday evening sealed a   at Atala after it was found to be functioning illegally for the second time in nine months after being shut. The move was resented by All India   (AIMIM), and the outfit has demanded the   to revoke the order. 

 The slaughter houses at Atala and Idgah were shut by the corporation on May 17, 2016, on the recommendations of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB). UPPCB had, in its report, stated that the slaughter houses are old and unsafe for the residents. It had also stated that they should not be opened till they are revamped.
 
 AMC authorities claimed that on January, 2017, miscreants had illegally opened the slaughter house but it was closed. 
 
 "At that time, too, the slaughter houses were sealed with the help of police. On Saturday and Sunday, we had received a complaint regarding some miscreants having broken the seal of the slaughter house, after which they were closed with the help of police," said AMC veterinary officer Dr Dheeraj Goyal. 
 
 Station house officer (SHO), Kareily, Jitendra Kumar Singh said, "There is nothing true about the state government's intervention or pressure behind closure of slaughter houses. We had provided police protection to AMC veterinary officer, who was there to seal the slaughter house."
 
 Meanwhile, AIMIM city president Afsar Mahmood, in an emergency meeting with the office-bearers, said that the decision has affected the daily wagers.
 
 "As per the UPPCB recommendations, it was decided that daily wagers will be allowed to work and the export of meat will be stopped till AMC comes up with a new building, but on Sunday, all workers were asked to stop work due to which there is a resentment among Muslim community."
 
 It may be mentioned here that Bharatiya Janata Party had in during election rallies promised that the if voted to power, the government would close all slaughter houses.
