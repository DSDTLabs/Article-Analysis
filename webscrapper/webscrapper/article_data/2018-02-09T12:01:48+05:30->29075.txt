PANCHKULA: Despite having the custody of a   accused of murdering his wife for 12 days, the police have failed to find her body. On Thursday, a local court sent the accused, Manmohan, in judicial custody for 14 days, even as police filed a written application seeking his narco analysis and lie detector test.

 The court will decide on giving the permission in the next hearing of the case on February 12. Police said Manmohan has been changing his statements regularly. Police sources said Manmohan is hiding the truth and not telling them where he dumped the body of his wife, Rajni Bala, alias Neetu.
 
 On January 16, Manmohan filed a missing report of his wife. But a few days later, police arrested his lover, Monika and her brother-in-law Sandeep Gill, who, police claimed, have confessed to their crime. 
 
 First, Manmohan told cops that he hired professional criminals from Neemuch village of Madhaya Pradesh to dump his wife’s body, but cops found nothing. He then told police that the body was near the forest in Sector 24. In his third statement, he claimed the body was dumped in the forest area of Morni near Himachal Pradesh.
 
 Police have so far recovered the car used in the crime from Manimajra. The rope used for strangulating Rajni and her sari were recovered from the open drain located at the rear of CTU workshop in Industrial Area.
 
 On the other hand, family members of the victim have lost hope of getting her body. Ramvati, the mother of the victim, said, “With Manmohan being sent to judicial custody, our hopes of getting Neetu’s body have been dashed.”
 
 Legal experts said the victim’s body was the most important evidence in the case. “It does not end the case, but will make it weak. 
 
 “The trial will continue on the behalf of the confession statements given by the co-accused and the rope and sari recovered in the case,” they said.
