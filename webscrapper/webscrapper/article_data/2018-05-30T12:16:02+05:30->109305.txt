PUNE: The   police on Monday arrested   (21), a criminal on police record, and booked his brother Anil for trying to extort money from a civic contractor’s supervisor. The contractor’s men were working on concretisation of a road near   temple at Taravade vasti in Wanowrie around 8pm on Monday when the two brothers approached them. 

 “The Bansode brothers armed with a weapon ordered the supervisor at the site to stop work and demanded money for continuing the same while a team of   officials was carrying out inspection,” said assistant inspector  . The suspects hurled abuses and pelted a stone at the supervisor and trampled on the freshly laid concrete patch, he added. 
 
 The contractor’s supervisor, Hrishikesh Thakar (27), registered a complaint against the Bansodes for demanding money, preventing them from performing their duty and causing grievous hurt, among other charges under IPC.
 
 Shinde said   has five cases registered against him with the Wanowrie and Hadapsar police stations. A police team is on the look out for Anil who is on the run after the incident.
