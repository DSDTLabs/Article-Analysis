NAGPUR: The ruling   in   (NMC) has denied charges of substandard work in construction of cement concrete roads and has said it was ready to get roads tested by any laboratory. "Jan Manch or any other individual or organization can take samples of cement roads. The only condition is an   official should be present there," ruling party leader Sandip Joshi said on Sunday. 

  Joshi said NMC was getting road samples tested by a third party Geotech. "We tested 13,980 samples and cracks were found only in 279. This means only 1.9% samples were defective. Norms state this figure should be less than 5%," he added. 
 
 Social organization Jan Manch had done an inspection of cement roads on May 1. Earlier, media had raised question marks about quality of cement roads. These allegations unnerved the NMC officials and office-bearers.
 
 According to Joshi there were 30 roads under Phase I of which 13 were complete. "Work is in progress on four, five are stuck due to various reasons and work is yet to begin on eight," he said.
 
  There are 58 roads under Phase II of which 18 are complete while work is going on on 33. "Work has not started on three roads while tender of one road has been floated," he further said. 
 
  Chief engineer Ulhas Debadwar admitted citizens were facing inconvenience due to partial closure of roads. He also siad large number of works including  , flyovers, etc were going on in the city causing traffic congestions. 
 
 Standing committee chairman Sandip Jadhav, A M Singare of Geotech and R K Ingle of Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) were also present.
