The city’s traditional chronic flood spot,  , in all probability will get waterlogged on a heavy rain day this monsoon too. 

 This is because the   would be able to complete only 200 metres of a planned 800-metre augmentation of a storm water drain project at the junction, which lies at the intersection of   and Parel. 
 
  
  
 
 Experts say work on the project should have started much earlier so that the augmented pipelines could have been ready by the monsoon. As it happened, the work started only in February. 
 
  
  
 
 The area around   is saucer-shaped, because of which it gets waterlogged every monsoon, creating massive traffic jams in Dadar and Parel, with a ripple effect from much further north all the way down to Fort. Last year, as per a BMC report, Hindmata flooded 10 out of 14 times when Mumbai received heavy rain. Civic officials then blamed narrow drains for delayed rainwater discharge.
 
    corporator and opposition party leader in the BMC Ravi   said the work status of the storm water drain project only shows how apathetical the civic body can be to the city’s problems. “While visiting a few pre-monsoon works undertaken by the BMC a few days ago, I found that storm water drain work had been undertaken at places where it was not required, while there was dillydallying over much-needed upgrades at chronic flood spots. This shows a lack of planning,” Raja said. 
 
 Civic officials said the augmentation work aims at connecting drain lines from Hindmata with the Britannia storm water pumping network. As of now, the junction is the last to be served by the Britannia pump, which is over 6km away.
 
    resident Nikhil Desai said, “Had the Hindmata work been taken up last year right after the monsoon, by now it could have been completed, giving the city relief during the rains this year.” RTI activist Anil Galgali said despite crores being spent to prevent waterlogging in the city, the story remains the same year after year.
