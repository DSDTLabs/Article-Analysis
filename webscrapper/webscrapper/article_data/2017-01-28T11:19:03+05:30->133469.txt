NEW DELHI:   vice-president   will address two public rallies in Punjab's Jalandhar and Sangrur district on Saturday.

 With Punjab going for election on February 4, the political battle escalated in the state on Friday with Prime Minister   and Rahul Gandhi engaging in a war of words. 
 
 In Jalandar, PM Modi addressed an election rally while campaigning for the Akali-BJP coalition. He termed the Congress as a "sinking ship" and "history" and called upon the people not to vote for the opposition party in the coming assembly elections. Earlier, Rahul too had taken a dig at the Prime Minister for standing with "the corrupt   leaders and talking of fighting corruption".
 
 He alleged that Modi was engaging in doublespeak by talking against corruption and still backing the "tainted" Badals. Rahul vowed to go hard against the menace of drugs "with harsh laws" if the Congress was voted to power. 
 
 The Punjab will see a triangular between the ruling BJP-SAD alliance, the Congress, and Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party.
