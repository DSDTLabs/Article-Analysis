GUWAHATI: All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) said the lynching of two youths on charge of cow theft in Nagaon district recently has set a worrying trend in the state, and demanded strong actions against those involved in the killings. AIUDF has also equated the Nagaon incident with the lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq in Uttar Pradesh's Dadri and   in  . 

 "The manner in which two youths were killed by a mob on charge of cow theft is a dangerous trend, and does not augur well for the peaceful coexistence of diverse communities in the state. The recent incident only raised the fear that the state is also catching up with the trend as it happened in Dadri and Rajasthan," AIUDF chief and MP,  , said recently.
 
 Last week, two youths-Aiyazuddin Ali and Abu Hanifa-were beaten to death by a mob at   area of Nagaon district. Members of the mob claimed that the duo was caught red-handed while trying to steal cows from the area. Both of them were in their early 20s. Police said the duo was rushed to the hospital but succumbed to their injuries.
 
 Three persons were arrested by police in Jorhat last month on charge of possessing beef for consumption, following a complaint by a local BJP leader that they offended religious sentiments. Among the three persons, one was a minor. The other two were booked under Section 295 (a) of the IPC and the Assam Cattle Preservation Act, 1950.
 
 "The last incident of killing in Nagaon district is an ominous sign of destruction of the age-old tradition of communal harmony. Such incidents should not go without proper investigation and culprits should be punished," Ajmal said.
