NEW DELHI: Karnataka's Congress chief minister   delivered a stinging comeback to   president   on Twitter today, calling him an "ex-jailbird".

 
 The chief minister was responding to comments made by the BJP president yesterday, who said "Siddaramaiah means corruption and corruption means Siddaramaiah".
 
 The Karnataka CM wasn't going to take Shah's comment about his alleged corruption lightly, so he drew attention to the fact that he thought it was rich that he's being accused by someone who's actually been in jail.
 
 "Says an ex-jail bird who chose another former jail bird to be his party's CM candidate for our Karnataka election. Can he present facts about the so called corruption charges against me or my Govt? Just telling lies wont help. People will not believe his #jumlas", tweeted Siddaramaiah.
 
  
  
 He was referring not just to Shah but also to the man Shah has chosen to be the BJP's CM candidate for the upcoming elections in Karnataka. That man is former BJP CM BS  , who was arrested and jailed for allegedly denotifying land in and around Bangalore illegally, for monetary gains. He was acquitted in 2016.
 
 The BJP president, meanwhile, was Gujarat's home minister when he was arrested and jailed in 2010 for allegedly getting   Sheikh killed in a fake encounter some years earlier. Like Yeddyurappa, Shah, too, was acquitted four years later.
 
 In fact, Shah's acquittal has been in the news lately, as the Supreme Court is hearing a plea on investigating the "suspicious death" of the judge who was hearing the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case. That judge, BH Loya, died midway through the trial. Some people allege that his death during this high-profile trial was no accident and they suspect foul play.
