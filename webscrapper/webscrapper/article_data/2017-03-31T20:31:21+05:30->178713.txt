HYDERABAD: Weeks after a man was forced to bring a toy tricycle after not getting a wheelchair at  , a similar episode unfolded at city's largest children's hospital  .

 On Thursday, a video of a girl child being shifted from the new building to the old building of the hospital went viral online. When asked, authorities said adequate stretchers were not available for patients and that is why the sick girl had to be moved by her own kin.
 
 This is not the first time patients have been left in the lurch.  , an attendant of another patient, recounted how on several occasions, he had to face similar issues. “There is severe shortage of wheelchairs and stretchers. Many times, I had to go and plead with officials to ensure sick children are treated on time,“ he said.
 
 Taking strong exception to  , local Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) joint secretary Syed Mohsin said there were several patients who had complained of lack of facilities in the hospital. He said child patients had been shifted, having been carried in arms, for treatment. “One of the little patients just passed before us with someone carrying an oxygen cylinder,'' Syed Mohsin.
 
 People demanded that the Telangana government ensure better facilities in all government hospitals. “If the ruling party fails to provide better facilities in government hospitals, we will protest," said one person on condition of anonymity .
 
 If the lack of stretchers wasn't enough, severe water shortage and lack of proper washroom facilities have forced relatives of patients to seek such facilities outside. “Even women have to spend the night outside. The government should have some facilities for relatives at night,“ said S Sridhar, a patient's relative.
