CHENNAI: For the thousands of engineering students in the state who don't always get hand-holding at every step of their course-from research to training and networking --a remedy is on the anvil.

 Anna University, which has recently set up a research and training wing, International Centre for Research Facilitation and Training (ICRFT), will act as a nodal point for four other state centres which are likely to be set-up in Coimbatore, Madurai, Tirunelveli and Trichy. These centres will be a bridge between the university's we alth of resources, network and students from all corners of the state.
 
 This would essentially make a student sitting in a town like   pursue a research by getting remotely guided through the nearest ICRFT centre. Besides having a pool of 80 faculty members, the ICRFT will also enable webinars, online consultation from expert faculty and industry players besides being connected online to the university's central library.
 
 The centre is also open to procuring data-on-demand based on student needs, from institutes and market researchers.
 
 J Kumar, director, Centre for Planning and Development, says the centre, which has been set-up at a cost of Rs 50 crore, is not just looking to commercialise ideas and projects that students come out with. Although library resources and journals via portals like   scholar do exist, he says many students don't know how to find appropriate data to bootstrap their projects.
 
 While industry-relations will be one of the main priorities for the centre, he said encouraging research as a habit, especially the “crazy invention“ type is important.
