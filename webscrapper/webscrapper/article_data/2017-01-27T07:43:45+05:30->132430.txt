“Tiger says you better be careful,” says German-born American conservationist   as he stands close to a photograph of a roaring Indian big cat hanging on a wall. In an interview to The Times Of India, the famed mammalogist, biologist and author, who’s on a visit to Karnataka, stresses on the need to act fast to  . He says, “If we don’t protect nature and wildlife now, there will be nothing left.” Excerpts:

 You travelled to   to study Mountain Gorillas when you were just 26. Since then you have been to various parts of the world. What keeps you going as a conservationist at this age?
 
 I’m still 83 years young. And yes, there is too much to do on conservation. If we don’t put efforts now things will only get worse. Love for my work keeps me going.
 
 Sadly, nature conservation is not on the priority list of our governments...
 
 The problem is the world is being run by big corporations of mining, timber mafia and others. Sadly governments and bureaucrats yield to their tactics. Big projects and big money is ruining the nature. Take the river linking project of Bundelkhand which is threatening about 200 sq km of forest cover in Panna Tiger Reserve. Governments just cannot ignore such treasures of nature.
 
 You have worked closely with governments in Asia, Africa, China and South America. How do you educate politicians on the need for nature conservation?
 
 Collecting scientific data plays a key role. You have to sit with key people in the government and make them understand the need for conservation. But that is only one part. Media and local NGOs have a major role in creating awareness among people. Not many understand scientific journals to understand nature. You guys can simplify it for them.
 
 Many new wildlife parks have been established as result of your efforts. What is the secret of your success?
 
 There is a need to look for people who are receptive. Continuous engagement with local communities can work wonders. But the real challenge is managing these parks. I have been working with the governments of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and China for developing a ‘Peace Park’ that would spread over 32,000 km. The aim is to protect the Marco Polo sheep endangered because of their spiral horns. There are some good developments but a lot still needs to be done.
 
 Man-animal conflict has become a major worry for India...
 
 The nature of conflict differs from place to place and it needs to be dealt with differently. Taking affected communities into confidence is the key. An NGO in Andhra Pradesh is educating villagers on how to behave in a tiger area. Simple things such as urging villagers to walk in group in the night, talk loudly so that the big cat finds its own way out are being taught. All these things matter a lot.
 
 Your take on the Western Ghats and related threats...
 
 Road projects are a threat to places like Western Ghats. I’m working in Iran where Asiatic Cheetahs are facing a major threat due to road projects since the past several years. Even if you are building roads, there needs to be speed breakers at regular intervals and an underpass or overpass for wild animals to pass. I could see a lot of roads humps in Bengaluru. Wish the government builds more of them in the roads that cut through wildlife sanctuaries. Controlled tourism is another key issue. And an eco-tourism project should share the profit with local communities. Otherwise, there won’t be a balance.
