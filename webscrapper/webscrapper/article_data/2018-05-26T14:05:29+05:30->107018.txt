It was a typical peak-hour evening Metro, packed to the capacity. I had boarded the last compartment of the AC train from   station. Within a few minutes, this man in yellow half-sleeve sweater stood behind me and started pressing himself against me.
 
 
 I moved a bit but this man kept following me around and even touched my private parts. I started shouting, alerting people around me about what he was doing but none came to my help and the man smirked and moved away.
 
 
  
 
 I felt humiliated and insulted and got down at Sovabazar station, went up to an RPF jawan and pointed out the man to him. But to my surprise, the RPF jawan rubbished my claims and told me not to bother him and go away. I called other officers roaming on the platform and some co-passengers as the train left the station. The other RPF personnel, too, began blaming me for creating a scene and one of them even told me I was making it up.
 
 I was, however, resolved and went up to the office of the station superintendent with the RPF personnel and demanded my complaint be accepted. He made me write a complaint on a   suggestion-cumcomplaint book about the incident and said they would forward the complaint to the police.
 
 But four months have passed and there has been no development, apart from a formatted reply from   in March, where they said they “thanked me” for the suggestions made in the book. The letter even asked me to reach out to RPF personnel in future in case of any trouble during   travel. But the reply had no mention on the development of the case I had registered.
