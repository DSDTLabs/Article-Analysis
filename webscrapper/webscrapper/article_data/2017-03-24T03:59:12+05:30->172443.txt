NEW DELHI: Come May and Delhi could become the first city to have a common transport   in the country. The Delhi   is all set to be used in DTC and cluster buses too. 

 K K Dahiya, special commissioner (transport), said, “The work on the project is mostly completed; we are waiting for the model code of conduct to be removed before we can announce a launch date.” 
 
 The common card, which will be redesigned by the government, will work the same way for the commuter on all modes of public transport —just swipe the card and you’re ready to go. According to Dahiya, recently installed electronic ticket machines on DTC and cluster buses would be compatible with the card. 
 
 “Success is dependent on the ETMs. We have tested them in around 1,700 cluster buses and all the DTC buses,” added Dahiya. While ETM usage is 100% in cluster buses and around 70% in DTC buses, the transport official said conductors were being trained. 
 
 Delhi   data suggests there are 27-30 lakh Metro commuters of whom 70% use   cards. Dahiya said existing smart card users will be able to use them for DTC and cluster buses while new users can get them from select DTC pass counters and other locations. DTC buses are taken by 35 lakh people daily, while cluster buses ferry 10 lakh. 
 
 Several names are being considered for the common card, with suggestions like Yaatri doing the rounds.
 
 The revenue from the card will be deposited in an escrow account, common to Delhi Metro, DTC and DIMTS. The revenue will be divided based on real-time data from the ETMs, added Dahiya.
 
 The common card project has been in the works for several years now, with the ministry of urban development coming out with an integrated card called More some years ago. That card was supposed to integrate all forms of transport, including autorickshaws and taxis. But it failed to take off and has been in use in the Delhi Metro network only.
