GANDHINAGAR:   Dr Maya  , who has been acquitted by the   high court in the 2002   massacre case, said here on Monday that she would resume her practise as a gynaecologist soon. 

 Terming the verdict as the victory of truth, Kodnani said she doesn’t want to recall the bad experience she had undergone in the past few year. “One thing I have learnt from this episode — live in present. There is no point discussing the past. I am happy with my present and will resume my normal life as a doctor soon,” she told TOI. 
 
 When asked about her plan to rejoin active politics, Kodnani said she had always remained a loyal BJP worker. 
 
 “I have not given thought to returning to active politics. It’s been only three-four days since the verdict has been delivered. I have been meeting those who stood by me and prayed for me. I also went to some religious places. Before I resume my normal work, I need some time to relax,” said Kodnani who was earlier awarded 28 years in jail by a special fast track court.
 
 She said it was only because of the support she got from her husband, Dr  , and other family members that she could endure the stressful 10 years. 
 
 “My husband backed me at every difficult moment. The family was like the backbone for me all these years. I could survive this ordeal only because of them,” said Kodnani at her husband’s hospital near Saijpur Tower, barely 1km from Naroda Patia. 
 
 “I don’t blame anyone for the hard times I underwent. Several BJP leaders and workers have met me or called me to expresses their good wishes,” she said.
 
 When asked where she see herself in the party, she said, “I am a BJP worker. A worker cannot be active or inactive. I have always tried to give my best to whatever assignment given to me by the party. I will follow this in future too.”
