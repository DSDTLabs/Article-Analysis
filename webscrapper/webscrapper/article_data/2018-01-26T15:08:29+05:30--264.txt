GURUGRAM: The National Green Tribunal ( ) has show-caused the state government, forest department, pollution control board and MCG in response to a petition, seeking a stay on construction of a   transfer station at Sikanderpur Ghosi village near DLF 1.

 Green tribunal has also sought reply from private agency, which has been hired by MCG to run the station for segregating and compressing waste before transferring remaining trash to Bandhwari landfills.
 
 All the   by February 27, the next date of hearing in the matter.
 
 Filed on Friday by four residents’ associations from DLF 1 area, the petition suggests that the waste transfer site has been planned on a plot that comes under the Aravali Notification of the Supreme Court — a blatant violation of environmental norms. The petition, a copy of which is with TOI, further states that the site falls in the catchment area of Nathupur drain, which receives rainwater from the Aravali hills and residential areas of DLF 1 and is protected under a state forest department notification.
 
 RS Rathee, the president of Gurugram Citizens’ Council, one of the four associations that have moved NGT on the issue, alleged that the waste transfer centre had been planned without obtaining approvals from the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF), pollution control board and state-level environment impact assessment authority. “We have been requesting the municipal corporation to prepare a solid waste management plan as per the state policy but in vain. Instead of addressing our concerns, the corporation is carrying out the construction for the waste transfer centre. We, therefore, had no other option but to move the green tribunal to stop the construction work,” Rathee added.
 
 When contacted, an MCG official said, “The matter is in the NGT and we will make a statement only after going through the notice, if any.”
