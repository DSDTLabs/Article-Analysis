Whenever a pizza delivery boy fails to show up on time, your pizza is free. To ensure that you do pay for your pizza, delivery boys often break traffic rules to reach on time by jumping red lights, speeding and driving in the wrong lane, etc.

 Road accidents related to food deliveries have caught the police’s attention, so when the Delhi Traffic Police organised the Road Safety Week earlier this month, they ensured that delivery boys were part of the awareness programme.
 
 
 
  
  To spread traffic awareness, a bike rally was organised at India Gate (BCCL)
 
 
 
 When asked if they follow traffic rules, a delivery boy said that it’s difficult to drive safely when you have limited time to deliver. Another delivery boy emphasized on the need of being alert while driving, and following traffic rules. He said, "Over 45 delivery boys were part of this event, and almost one boy from each pizza chain is here."

 To spread traffic awareness, a bike rally was organised at India Gate, and the police distributed free helmets. Police officials told us that the focus of this drive was on helmets.  , Special Commissioner, Delhi Police, who was the chief guest, said, "It won’t be appropriate to call this a celebration of road safety, unless the number of road accidents comes down to zero." BK Singh, additional CP, Traffic, told us, "Traffic legislation, driver education and police enforcement have to keep pace. We organize these programmes throughout the year to educate commuters about traffic rules, it’s not restricted to just a week."
