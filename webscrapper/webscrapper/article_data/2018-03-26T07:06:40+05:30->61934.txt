KANPUR: In Sunday’s episode of `Mann Ki Baat’, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appreciated the efforts of a city doctor   for giving   to poor patients at his makeshift clinic at a footpath near   in the city. The PM while addressing the nation in his monthly radio programme--’Mann ki Baat’, lauded Dr Ajit Mohan Chaudhary for his great service to humanity.

 "When I heard the story of Kanpur based doctor Ajit Mohan Choudhary that how he consults the underprivileged at a footpath and offers free medicines to them, it gives one an opportunity to feel the sense of brotherhood that prevails in the country," the PM said.
 
 
 When asked how he feels when his name was mentioned by PM Narendra Modi, Dr Chaudhary expressed his happiness for being recognised for his work. "I am deeply touched by the PM’s gesture. At the same time, I expect other people, who have expertise in various fields, to offer their services to the poor and the needy," said Dr Chaudhary while talking to TOI.
 
 The PM also gave example of a cab driver from Kolkata, Saidul Laskar, who due to delay in medical treatment, lost his sister 13 years ago. Thereafter, he vowed to construct a hospital in order to ensure that no poor or downtrodden faced a similar fate due to lack of medical aid. Modi said Saidul sold off his family jewellery and raised funds through charity. His cab passengers too contributed whole-heartedly. 
 
 A young engineer girl donated her first salary for this noble cause. This way, after mobilizing funds for twelve long years, Saidul’s hard work paid and today, a 30-bedded hospital has finally come up at Punri Village near Kolkata, the PM said. "This is the power of New India", he added.
 
 A few days ago, PMO had sought details of Dr Ajit Mohan Chaudhary, who examines and attend patients every day for one hour (from 8 am to 9 am) free of charge at his makeshift clinic at   near Chetna Crossing near collectorate.
