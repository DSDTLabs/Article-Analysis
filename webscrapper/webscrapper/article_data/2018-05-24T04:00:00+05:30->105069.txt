The Ramco Cements has reported a 14.9% year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in profit after tax (PAT) on a consolidated basis to Rs 563.8 crore during 2017-18. 

 Net revenues, however, increased 11.2% y-o-y to Rs 4,456.5 crore on a consolidated basis during the year. 
 
 The company’s board has recommended a dividend of Rs 3 per share for the year.
 
 The sale of cement stood at 93.12 lakh tonnes, a 12% y-o-y gain, in 2017-18. 
 
  Cement sales crossed the 90 lakh mark for the first time ever. 
 
 “Due to sluggishness in economic development in Tamil Nadu, the company could not improve its sales, compared to the previous year,” Ramco said. “Scarcity of sand also contributed to the lack of growth,” it said.
 
 The company said it has grown strongly in the eastern market during the year. 
 
 “This had contributed to the significant growth in the overall sales of the company for the year,” Ramco stated. The average diesel price increased by 8% during the year, which resulted in an increase in the transportation cost of raw materials and finished goods, it said.
