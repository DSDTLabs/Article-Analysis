PATNA: A day after CM   said that the  , initially proposed to be developed on the bank of Ganga at  , might be shifted to Bhagalpur owing to land acquistion issues, the varsity administration on Wednesday offered to make available the land for the purpose at the earliest.

 PU vice-chancellor   said the university received a letter from the state government recently with a request to provide land on its campus. The letter says if the government does not get a favourable response from PU, the proposed centre would be shifted to Bhagalpur.
 
 A multi-storey building is proposed to be constructed on two acres of PU land in front of Patna Law College for housing the centre. One floor of the building will be given to PU for its academic activities and the PU VC will be the ex-officio working director of the centre. This centre doesn’t need to be registered as an “autonomus” institution under the Societies’ Registration Act, the VC said.
 
 Earlier in January 2015, the PU syndicate had rejected a government’s proposal for leasing out two acres of university’s land to it for setting up the proposed centre. The syndicate, at its meeting held under the chairmanship of then vice-chancellor Y C Simhadri, had observed that the university could not lease out its land to any “foreign” institution.
 
 Now that it is clarified that the dolphin research centre would not be an autonomous institution, the VC hoped, the PU syndicate should not deny its nod for land for it. Singh said it would be in the academic interest of the university to have the centre in PU. 
 
 The idea of setting up Asia’s first dolphin research centre in Patna was mooted when   deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia visited Patna on February 18, 2012 and watched dolphins in the Ganga. Subsequently, the state government sent a proposal to the Centre which okayed it and sanctioned necessary funds for the same. But the proposal got stuck up following PU’s “no” to the request for land.
