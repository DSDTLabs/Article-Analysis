She might have dabbled in various film industries, and learnt the languages during the course, but   is fiercely protective about her state, and her mother tongue. The actress, who recently released a   song that elaborated the significance of the language and its rich culture on a video-sharing site to ring in International Mother Language Day, has now released a poem in   online. 

 Neetu says, “The poem has been written and directed by my brother  , along with actor Vikash Kumar. The crux of the poem is that Hindi is important, but how can you ignore your mother tongue? This has been done in an effort to create awareness about the various Bihari languages and their rich culture. There are five languages in   — Bhojpuri, Maithili, Magahi, Aangika and Bajjika — and they are totally different from each other. Magahi has been spoken since the Magadha dynasty ruled in India. I want to make films, videos and documentaries in these languages so that we can make natives feel proud of their roots.”
