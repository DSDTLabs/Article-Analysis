KOLKATA: Netaji Bhavan   station celebrated Women’s Day by becoming the first in the city to be run by an all-women team. From managing ticket counters to to housekeeping, a group of over 25 women will be managing the operations at the station from now on.

 Station superintendent  , the senior-most member of the squad, took over the affairs of the Metro station at 4.30pm on Thursday evening, accompanied by her team. The change found immediate resonance with regulars who cheered and clapped when the news was announced on the public address system.
 
 Ghosh, who was busy chalking out a blueprint for smoother functioning, said her priorities will include providing hassle-free journey and laying more stress on women’s safety.
 
 “We have a young team of women who will be working very hard to fulfil the expectations our seniors have from us. The responsibility has motivated us in going out of our way to help our passengers and work round-the-clock to make the Metro journey more comfortable,” said Ghosh, adding: “My girls are fully equipped to tackle surge of passengers or handle people in distress. It is a great initiative and I hope it will inspire many more such initiatives.”
 
 Netaji Bhavan was chosen for the unique legacy it enjoys. “Not only is Netaji Bhavan the first Metro station in the country — it started in October 1984 — but it is also the station from where the first Metro train started its journey. So when we were giving shape to the idea of creating the first Metro station to be run by an all-women team, Netaji Bhavan was our first choice,” said Indrani Banerjee, chief  .
 
 The decision found support among women passengers. “Many days I take the last Metro back to Bhowanipore. The station is deserted at that time and that makes me feel a little scared. But the next time I am late and the platform is deserted, I know I have no reason to worry because there are so many women working here for our safety,” said  , who works in a   in Girish Park.
