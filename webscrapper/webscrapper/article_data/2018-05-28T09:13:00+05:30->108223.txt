LUCKNOW: More than 150 industrial units in   and   that have been told by   that their expired 90-year land lease would not be renewed again now plan to move court against the decision. Since LDA decided to stop lease renewal, these units have to look for industrial land elsewhere or buy the same plot in auction. 

 Owners of most units said that they don't have the money to buy the land in auction. 
 
 LDA intends to build housing and commercial projects on the land. When TOI contacted proprietors of these units, they unanimously were in favour of filing a case against LDA in high court for delaying their lease renewals.
 
 The most prominent unit,  , has already filed a case. A company official told TOI, "Renewal of our lease is pending since 2016. We completed all formalities and submitted fee within the deadline of 90 days before lease expiry but LDA babus kept delaying the renewal. They wanted monetary favours. So we approached HC for intervention. We will not leave our land."
 
 Pramod Agarwal, owner of a plastic manufacturing unit, said, "Where would we get money to buy land? Most units have already stopped because of unfavourable policies and heavy taxes. Those still operating are struggling."  , owner of a cable firm, said LDA decision would lead to closure of units and hit employees.
