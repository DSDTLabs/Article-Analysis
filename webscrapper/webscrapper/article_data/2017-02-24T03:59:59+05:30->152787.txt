NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Thursday directed the AAP government to give a “pin-pointed” action plan for cleaning an open drain near   Inter State Bus Terminus (ISBT) in east Delhi.

 After the Delhi government and east corporation informed the court about the steps taken to implement HC’s last directions on removing debris and better traffic management in the area to reduce air pollution, the court decided to focus on cleaning up the open drain next to residential areas.
 
 The direction by a bench of justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Ashutosh Kumar came when it felt that the action plan placed before it by the Delhi government’s irrigation department is “vague” and “wishy-washy” as it gave no time schedule for cleaning up the drain.
 
 The court insisted on a deadline to ensure that the Delhi government and other stakeholders finish work in a time-bound manner. The court asked all agencies, including ISBT, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, Public Works Department and East Delhi Municipal Corporation, to file their status reports on action taken to implement the court’s February 16 order, directing them to clean up the area and regulate the traffic to reduce air pollution, caused by flying dust and vehicle emissions.
 
 The court separately directed Delhi Metro to “make green” the vacant land of railways adjoining   station and also immediately remove construction-related debris from the area under its control.
 
 Delhi Metro and railways assured the court that steps will be taken to clear garbage and debris and make it a green area.
 
 The court, hearing a PIL initiated by it on air pollution in the capital, sought status reports before the next date of hearing on March 2. HC is currently monitoring the Anand Vihar area as it has the worst air quality in the city.
 
 The court had on the last date observed that lack of coordination among local authorities was the reason for half of the city’s problems.
