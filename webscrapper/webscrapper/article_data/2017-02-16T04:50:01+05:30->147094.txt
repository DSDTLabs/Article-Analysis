CHENNAI: A metropolitan magistrate's court in George Town on Wednesday sentenced an MTC bus driver to one year of imprisonment for running over a man in an accident on March 2016. 

 The Royapuram traffic police told the court that 40-year-old Sivarajan, an electrician, was on his way to work from his house in Tondiarpet when an MTC bus plying between Washermenpet and Thiruvottiyur knocked him down. He died on the spot.
 
 Police arrested bus driver Bhagyaraj, now 35, and charged him under IPC Section 304A (rash or negligent action causing death). A court convicted him but granted him bail and the case was pending before the George Town courts.
 
 During cross-examination in a metropolitan magistrate's court, police officers maintained that Bhagyaraj was travelling at high speed on a crowded road when he lost control of the vehicle and knocked down Sivarajan.
 
 They said Sivarajan was riding a motorcycle on the extreme left of the road and Bhagyaraj, after overtaking other vehicles, had driven the bus into Sivarajan's path. Bhagyaraj tried to avoid Sivarajan but the bus hit the electrician all the same.
 
 After hearing both sides cross, the judge, Mohammed Farooq, sentenced Bhagyaraj to one year of imprisonment. Justice Farooq also fined him 6,000. He said Bhagyaraj would have to serve an additional month in jail if he failed to pay the fine.
