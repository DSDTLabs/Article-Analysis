Mumbai:   has said that a board panel has approved an   of its subsidiary   Insurance by offering the public 10% of the company’s share. The Arundhati Bhattacharya-led bank said it was looking at diluting its stake by 8% through the IPO.

 Given that SBI Life was valued at Rs 46,000 crore following a private placement in December 2016, a 10% stake sale could generate Rs 4,600 crore for the bank. 
 
 In December, the country’s largest bank sold a 3.9% stake to private equity investors   and Temasek Holdings at Rs 460 a share. The deal valued SBI Life at 3.5 times its embedded value of Rs 13,000 crore for 2016-17. Embedded value is a measure of a company’s worth which factors in future earnings from policies that have already been sold.
 
 This year, SBI Life has grown its business at 45% as against an industry growth of 22%. SBI Life’s proposed IPO will have enough room for foreign institutional investors as its joint venture partner Cardif (owned by French lender  ) has decided against hiking the stake up to the permissible 49%. 
 
 The SBI had however taken a call that it would decide to hold over 50% in all its subsidiaries in order to ensure management control.
 
 SBI Life managing director Arjit Basu had recently said that the company does not require additional capital until 2019 given that it has a paid up net worth of Rs 5,000 crore as against its capital of Rs 1,000 crore.
