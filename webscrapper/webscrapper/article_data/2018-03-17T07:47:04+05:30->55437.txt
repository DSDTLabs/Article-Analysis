PUNE: The state government may finally be able to consider decreasing   (RR) rates following the amendment to the Bombay Stamp Rules, 1995. 

 Earlier, the rules only had mention of the word "increase". 
 
 The amendment to the rules will allow the government to either increase or decrease the   (RR) to be announced on April 1. 
  
  
 Last week, a government-appointed sub-committee had suggested that there be no increase in this year's   in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). Credai, the apex body of the builders, wanted the same policy across the state to boost the ailing   sector.
