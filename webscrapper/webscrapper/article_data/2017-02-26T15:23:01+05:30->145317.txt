 and Rakul Preet starrer   has released its trailer finally after much ado. 

  The trailer does look promising as a commercial entertainer with peppy numbers by   and grand visuals. However, it quite frankly doesn't look like it has anything new to offer considering the boy-meets-girl love track, hero butting heads with the villain and the punch dialogues. The only intriguing factor about the trailer is the recurring mention of horse races. 
 
  Incidentally the talk is that the film's trailer was delayed and postponed from the originally scheduled date because of the missing disclaimer that said, 'No animals were harmed' The makers finally released the poster after putting that disclaimer in place. 
 
  The film is directed by Gopichand Malineni and will hit the screens soon. 
 Check out the trailer
