MAPUSA: The police on Friday said one of the two Russian pimps who was arrested at   on Wednesday, was a book author and claimed to be an expert in ‘psychedelic culture’. 

 Sources also disclosed that  , 44, had settled in Goa in 2004 and used to run a restaurant. Both, Karavaev and  , 36, have been remanded in five days police custody by a local court. 
 
 Anjuna PI   told TOI that Karavaev had been arrested in 2009 by the anti-narcotics cell (ANC) in a psychotropic drugs case and his passport attached. The case is pending trial before the court.
 
 Morozli was caught red-handed on Wednesday after he arrived at Anjuna with a woman meant for a decoy customer. 
 
 During interrogation, he told the police that he and an accomplice ran the sex racket from a rented apartment at Siolim. The police subsequently raided the apartment and arrested his accomplice, Karavaev. While the women in the racket were all foreigners, a majority of them comprised Russians and Ukrainians. 
 
 Patil said the accused visited Goa regularly and managed to stay off the police’s radar because they’d rent flats in upscale residential complexesowned mostly by non-Goansfor their customers, all of whom were foreign nationals only. No hotels were used in the racket, the PI said. 
 
 Sources in the police force also told TOI that the duo would contact potential customers over the phone or internet after having sold them books on the beach.
