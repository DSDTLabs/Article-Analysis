NAGPUR: The city today took its first official step towards heralding in the online Centralized Admission Procedure (CAP) for Std XI admissions with a meeting between principals and education department going off smoothly.  , assistant director of education (Nagpur division) said proper arrangements will be made to ensure guidance for   and other board students well. “State board students from city will apply for CAP through their schools while those from other boards and from outside city can seek guidance at the six zonal centres,” said Patve. 

 The process will be started soon after the information booklets are available. Patve said, “Balbharti will be publishing the information booklets and after that students can start applying. Application has to be made in two parts. The first part, also called Part-A, will be where student enters his or her information online and that has to be verified by the principal.” The verification by principal will ensure that important details like reservation category, birth date etc are entered in the online database correctly. Patve said, “After this the Part-B online form can be filled by the student in which choice of colleges can be given. Of course, seat allocation will be based on merit ranking of student.”
 
 Another change in   will be that there won’t be any counselling sessions for admissions. Students will get to see their allocated college online and decide the further course of action. Patve said, “If a student sees that he has not got admission in the college of his choice then there will be an ‘auto-updation’ button that can be clicked which will offer the next available college.” After the process is complete students can simply take a printout of the college allocation and complete the admission formalities. 
 
 Patve agreed that by going online the education department will save countless man-hours apart from increasing transparency.
