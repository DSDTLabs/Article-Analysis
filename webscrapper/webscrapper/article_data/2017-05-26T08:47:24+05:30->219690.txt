CHENNAI: With illegal sub-letting of space rampant in the Koyambedu wholesale market complex, effective measures to tackle the menace will be key in determining whether the   (CMDA) succeeds in retaining control of the market, when a PIL related to lack of amenities in the complex comes up for hearing in June.

 According to the advocate commissioner's report tabled before the Madras HC, about four feet of space at the front of most shops in all three markets operating in the complex has been encroached upon, blocking free access to the public.
 
 "Unlicensed vendors pay an illegal rent to the owners of shops in front of which they are allowed to sell. At some shops, the owners themselves employ such unlicensed persons to sell various commodities," the report noted.
 
 Speaking to TOI, B  , the chief administrative officer ( ), Market Management Committee ( ), said it was difficult for his administration to take action due to unruly behaviour exhibited by people accused of encroachment.
 
 Junior engineer  , who assists the CAO in the MMC administration, said that recently a shop owner in the market, who was slapped with an encroachment removal notice, tried attacking MMC officers with a knife. "We filed a complaint and an FIR was registered," he said. 
 
 "We take steps to remove encroachments once or twice a month and issue notices before doing so. But the staff under MMC are nowhere near enough to handle this issue for the whole market complex," Balasubramanian said.
