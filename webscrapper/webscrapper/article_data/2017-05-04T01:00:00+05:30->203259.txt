Priyanka Chopra, on her whirlwind trip to the city in April, played a gracious host a couple of times. On one such occasion, she invited a bunch of friends to her Juhu pad for a get-together.

 On the guest-list were several A-list celebrities, including  , Sidharth Malhotra,   and Arpita Khan-Sharma. While Alia and Sidharth arrived with mentor  , Arpita came with husband Aayush Sharma. Arjun too turned up for the bash, with his sister Anshula in tow. Now, the actor has a history with both the girls — he had dated Arpita for a while and was linked up with Alia during the making of 2 States.
 
 We hear, Arpita didn’t even acknowledge his presence at the bash. And it seems Alia also didn’t go beyond a casual ‘hello’ and chose to stick around with Sidharth and her other friends. While Arjun mingled with others, we’re told that he left earlier than most guests at the party.
