BENGALURU: Citing the strike call issued by a section of its employees, the Bangalore   Rail Corporation Limited ( ) approached the Karnataka high court, seeking the vacation of an interim order passed last year which stayed a notification bringing Metro services under the   (ESMA) Act 2013. 

 The corporation apprehends that employees, who have threatened to go on strike if their demands are not met by March 22, may stop Metro services. 
 
 "The proposed strike will cripple public transport in Bengaluru, resulting in huge distress to commuters. The strike is not in the interest of the city," the BMRCL claimed in its interlocutory application.
 
 According to the corporation, the BMRCL Employees Union, the petitioner which issued the strike call, has not been recognized and is not engaged in any discussion with the management. It also claimed that many issues raised by the union are pending before labour officers and going on strike only amounts to an illegality. 
 
 Further, the corporation stated that as per the memorandum of understanding signed in 2010, the Karnataka government is entitled to appoint five directors, including the MD to BMRCL, and the corporation is actually a state government body. 
 
 Referring to last year's snap strike by Metro workers, BMRCL claimed that employees left stations unmanned, compromising the safety of commuters.
 
 Meanwhile, Justice L Narayanaswamy asked the union to submit its response to the IA while adjourning the hearing to March 20. The interim order passed by the court is extended till then.
 
 ESMA was extended to BMRCL employees after a flash strike in July first week brought trains to halt for seven hours, leaving thousands of commuters stranded. A tussle between Metro staff and   personnel had triggered the strike.
