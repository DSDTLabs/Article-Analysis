INDORE: While the civic body has planned to construct many smart buildings in the   area,   police station which comes under the Area Based Development (ABD) initiative will also get smarter.

 IMC officials said the old police station will be removed from the area and a new police station will be constructed nearby. Around Rs 1.3 crore will be spent on the project.
 
 “The new police station will be equipped with all modern facilities to meet requirements. It will be constructed keeping in mind the average footfall at the station as well as making it comfortable for officials working here,” said  , commissioner, Indore Municipal Corporation.
 
 Singh said apart from modern facilities, the design will ensure that natural light and proper ventilation enter the building.
 
 Mayor Malini Gaud, Manish Singh and DIG Harinayanchari Mishra on Monday conducted an inspection of the police station. IMC officials shared a detailed proposed plan of the police station and the DIG said he was satisfied with it.
 
 The present police station comes in the way of the civic body’s plan to widen roads under the Smart City project. Officials said the present structure will be demolished and a temporary one will be constructed to ensure work is not obstructed.
 
 Officials said they have surveyed the area and will come up with the temporary arrangement soon. Tenders will then be floated for the construction of a new police station.
