Mohali: The killer Airport Road claimed another life when a Hyundai Verna car jumped a divider, crossed over to the other side and collided head-on with a truck around 10.30pm on Tuesday.

 Car driver Puneet Sabharwal, 26, a resident of Morinda, died on the spot, said the police. Such was the impact that the two airbags in car burst after inflating and the spare tyre fell off through the backseat. The car engine was completely smashed and the undercarriage of the truck was also damaged.
 
 The accident occurred when Puneet, a businessman, was negotiating the S-turn opposite a shrine. GMADA has failed to construct a straight road on the spot. The police said the truck driver was not at fault as he was going in the right direction and it was the car that jumped the divider.
 
 Mataur SHO inspector Jarnail Singh said, “We have inspected the spot and prima facie the car driver lost control due to the sharp S-turn, jumped the divider, went to the other side of the road and ran into the truck. The truck driver fled the spot, fearing arrest. We will initiate inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPC. The body has been sent to Phase VI civil hospital for a post-mortem examination, which will be conducted on Thursday.”
 
 Police said the car driver was coming from Zirakpur side of the Airport Road.
