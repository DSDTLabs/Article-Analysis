Mysuru: The   youth who attempted suicide after allegedly being harassed by police succumbed to his injuries on Tuesday. 

 Dhananjaya, 20, had attempted suicide twelve days ago.
 
 Though Saligrama police have booked his tormentor Sandeep and three others for abetting suicide, his relatives are demanding to book two police constables who allegedly harassed Dhananjaya, prompting him to take the extreme step.
 
 Dhananjaya of Saligrama in KR Nagar taluk had consumed some toxic liquid while sitting on his three-wheel bicycle near a college in Saligrama on January 18, a day after Saligrama police summoned him twice and questioned him in connection with a theft. A police personnel also attacked him with a lathi, the video of which has gone viral.
 
 Sandeep and his accomplices, who run a garage in Saligrama, had unofficially complained about the theft on January 17. Though there was no formal complaint or petition against Dhananjaya, he was harassed. Moreover, the entire questioning was recorded on a mobile phone and then circulated through social media leading him to end his life.
 
 Dhananjaya slipped into depression following humiliation at the police station and then is said to have attempted suicide.
 
 Dhananjaya’s relative Pandu told TOI: “Though we have complained against two police personnel, their names have been dropped from the FIR. We had planned a dharna with the body in front of the police station demanding justice, but owing to lunar eclipse, we went ahead with the funeral.”
 
 Pandu said that he will be meeting the SP on Thursday demanding to initiate action against the cops who, too, were responsible for Dhananjaya’s death.
 
 Dhananjaya died around 7.30pm on Tuesday. He was laid to rest at his native on Wednesday.
