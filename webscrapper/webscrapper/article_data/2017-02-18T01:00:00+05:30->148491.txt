Filmmaker   works doubly hard to add shine and complexity to every personality he constructs on paper. His Casablanca-like love story, ' ', set against the backdrop of World War II, is not any different.

 Take   for instance, who plays Nawab Mallik, a soldier in the British Army. This is the third time that heâ€™s teamed up with Vishal. Each character that has been written for him so far has been diametrically different from the others. Shahid played twin roles in 'Kaminey', the affable Guddu and the gangster Charlie, and the title role in 'Haider' which was bore shades of grey. 
 
 This time too, Vishal ensured that Shahid gets a challenging part to play, which is the reason he was cast as the man the fiery Miss   falls head-over-heels in love with. 
 
 'Rangoon', presented by Viacom18 Motion Pictures, Vishal Bhardwaj Pictures and Sajid Nadiadwala, releases February 24.
