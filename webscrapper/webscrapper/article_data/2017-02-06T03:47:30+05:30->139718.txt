KOHIMA: In the wake of violence over 33% reservation of seats for women in urban local bodies (ULBs), the   cabinet decided on Saturday to approach the Centre to keep the state out of the purview of Part IXA of the Constitution which deals with municipalities and their composition.

 The T R Zeliang government, in an emergency Cabinet meeting attended by legislators of all tribes, decided to submit a memorandum to PM   seeking a Constitution amendment “through an ordinance”.
 
 Part IXA has for long been opposed by tribal Hohos for going “against the customary and traditional practices of the Nagas”. Many believe that Part IXA clashes with Article 371 (A) of the Constitution which guarantees special rights to the state of Nagaland. Under the article, customary laws, social practices, beliefs of the people and the resources of the state are safeguarded from intervention by the Centre and its policies unless the   decides so by a resolution. While provision 243(T) of Part IXA grants reservation to women in municipalities, Naga social groups have said this goes against their customary laws as protected by Article 371(A).
 
 The decision, however, failed to impress the Nagaland Tribes Action Committee which has been at the forefront of the agitation against women’s reservation. “This move of by the Cabinet mocks the powers of the Assembly and provisions of Article 371 (A)” it said in a statement.
