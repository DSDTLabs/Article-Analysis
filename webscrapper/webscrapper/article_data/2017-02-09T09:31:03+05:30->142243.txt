NEW DELHI: For ex-players, having an IPL contract along with a job in any other team -national or state -gives rise to a few questions. However, the coaching staff of the Indian team, both U-19 and senior team, has gone about it smartly, trying to evade any conflict of interest, at least on paper.

 It is learnt that the likes of   (India ` A' and U-19 coach),   (assistant coach of the senior team) and   (former bowling coach) all have had contracts which didn't overlap with their contracts with respective franchises.
 
 While Bangar is no more with the   and Arun has been relieved of his duties with the Indian team last year, Dravid is the only person now who works with   and the national teams.
 
 Dravid's contract with Daredevils is actually for two months and his BCCI contract gets over in March, a month before he officially takes charge of the IPL team. “This is very well thought-out ploy. It first came to light when Bangar cleared it in front of BCCI ombudsman AP Shah. His BCCI contract, in the last two years, began after May once the IPL got over and concluded in March when the national team got free to play the IPL,” a source close to the development told TOI. “Dravid's is believed to be a similar case,“ the source added.
 
 Interestingly , Daredevils's assistant coach Pravin Amre had to relinquish his job as a managing committee member of the Mumbai Cricket Association as the ombudsman ruled it as a conflict-of-interest. Amre now has contract with Daredevils whereby he works around the year with the franchise.
 
 Vijay Dahiya, too, was accused when he was the coach of Delhi team and assistant coach of the Kolkata Knight Riders. However, he was released by KKR by the time the ombudsman summoned him.
