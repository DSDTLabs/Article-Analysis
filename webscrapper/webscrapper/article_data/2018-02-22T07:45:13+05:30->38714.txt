HYDERABAD:   and stalked on social media have become rampant in the city. In the past one year, SHE Teams arrested over 1,500 people for harassing women in the city.

 “Out all the   we’ve caught for harassment, about 30% were found stalking women. We get frequent complaints of stalking on social media, stalking and harassment over phone,” said ACP, SHE Teams, D Kavitha. What’s shocking is that 10% of the offenders were minors. “Most of the minors caught were unaware of stalking being a crime and just did it for fun. Only after counselling, they realised that it was an offence,” the ACP added.
 
  
 Women rights activists said many movies and online shows showed stalking as romantic persistence.
 
 “In many movies or songs the lead actors stalk the actress to express love. When the youth is exposed to such content, it impacts their behaviour,” said Jameela Nishat, founder of Shaheen Women’s Resource and Welfare Association, a citybased NGO that works for the welfare of women.
 
 Nishat added that so far they have received 100 harassment complaints from women, especially from Old City. “Some women are scared to go to the police. So, they come to the NGO and complain. There have been several cases where the boy has continued to stalk the girl, even when she had said ‘no’ to the proposal. If that didn’t work, some boys harass girls by calling them continuously,” said Nishat.
 
 “In social media harassment cases, not many women file an FIR. Most of them just give a verbal complaint or petition. We receive nearly 10 to 15 petitions every month,” said a cop from the cyber crime cell.
