VELLORE: The   of the   police picked up 15 people, including 13 men from Jawadhu Hills in Tamil Nadu, from an eatery at Tirumala on Sunday morning.

 Acting on a tip off, a task force team led by reserve sub-inspector M Vasu swarmed the eatery near the famous Venkateswara Temple around 7am. They arrested 13 men, aged between 25 and 40 years, who were having food at the eatery, and waiting for their handlers Munusamy and Ayyappan, residents of Tirupati, to take them to the designated spot in Seshachalam Reserve Forest.
 
 Devotees, who were having food at the eatery, panicked when police personnel in plainclothes started picking up some men without any explanation.
 
 “We spotted Munusamy and Ayyappan when we were patrolling from Garuda Circle to Cherlopalli in Tirupati around 6.30am. They were moving in a suspicious manner. Since they were involved in red sanders smuggling early and had many cases against them, we picked them for inquiry,” said Vasu.
 
 On interrogation, they spilled the beans and divulged that they were on their way to Tirumala to hand over food items and groceries to the   from Jawadhu Hills, who had reached Tirumala earlier, and take them into the forest to fell trees. “The two have also revealed that Srinivasa Reddy, a notorious smuggler based in Tirupati, had engaged the tribals,” said RSASTF sub-inspector of police G Ashok Kumar.
 
 The police have been questioning the 13 men from Jawadhu Hills. Since they were arrested outside the forest area, the police invoked Section 41 of CrPC. “We will produce them before the executive magistrate and bind over them. They will be released later,” added the police official.
 
 Recently, the task force secured over 80 tribal men Vellore and Tiruvannamalai. However, they released after the task force bounded them over.
