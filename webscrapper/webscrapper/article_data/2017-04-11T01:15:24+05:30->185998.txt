Noida: Having decided to adopt the state’s town vending policy, the   on Monday directed its planning department to identify major commercial areas in the city within three days to create vending zones. The move comes in the wake of large-scale anti-encroachment drives being undertaken by the Authority and complaints from the vendors that their livelihood was being affected.

 “Noida Authority had forwarded its proposal for the town vending policy to the state government last year, but received a letter from the government asking it to instead adopt the state government’s policy,” Saumya Srivastava, deputy CEO, Noida Authority, told TOI. “With the basic parameters of the policy being the same, we informed the government that we had no objections to their suggestion. The state government had then asked us to submit a list of earmarked vending zones,” he said.
 
 “However, our planning department has pointed out that these vending spaces need to be located in commercial areas. I have asked the planning department to provide me with a list of major commercial areas in the cityin the next three days,” Srivastava said. Key features of the policy will include declaring roads as no-hawker zones besides charging vendors for carrying out business.
