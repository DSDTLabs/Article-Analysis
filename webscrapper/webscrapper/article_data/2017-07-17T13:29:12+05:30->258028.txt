AHMEDABAD: A city which is already on the edge with three of the four   cases reported in the country cannot afford to be careless with its vector control programme. The recent rains and sewage spills have led to formation of large stagnant pools, which are now turning into active breeding ground for mosquitoes and can, if ignored, act as pacemakers for malaria, dengue, chikungunya and now Zika. These vector-borne diseases can spread rapidly within a population, especially among those living in poor neighbourhoods.

 A large open ground on   road has collected water over past two weeks and residents here have already started complaining of increasing mosquitoes. 
 
 “Such breeding grounds can affect a large population and can even infect residents of Prahladnagar, Anandnagar and Vejalpur areas nearby. The health teams are yet to respond,” said a senior AMC zonal official. 
 
 A similar situation is witnessed near   in   area where an open field has collected water. The stagnant pool has already started to emanate a foul stench. 
 
 In Vatva area just besides the Kharicut canal, a chawl cluster stays exposed to stagnant water which is posing a major health risk for residents here. “The engineering department has to co-operate to ensure ways of draining such water out in each zone,” said a state health department official. “Such stagnant pools are huge health risks, especially when vector borne disease are concerned. Worldwide studies show Zika spreads rapidly in poor neighbourhoods,” he added.
