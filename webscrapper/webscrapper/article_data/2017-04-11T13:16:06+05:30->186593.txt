SURAT: With a plan to maintain law and order in the Diamond City prior to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit next week, police have started a drive to nab around 2,700 habitual offenders as a preventive measure. City police commissioner Satish Sharma has ordered that offenders arrested twice or more in the past three years for any crime be arrested.

 As part of the drive that has been launched from Monday, a total of 530 people with criminal history have been already arrested. Police will catch only those who have been arrested twice or more in the past three years under section 151 of Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 
 At least 350 habitual offenders who were arrested for serious crimes in the past will be sent to jail under the Prevention of Anti-social Activities Act (PASA). This action of the police will help keep criminals away from the city when the Prime Minister will be touring and also ensure that they don’t have a free run anymore. 
 
 “People with criminal background who had committed serious crimes will be sent to jail under PASA. At least 350 people with criminal record who had carried out serious crimes will be externed from the city,” Satish Sharma said.
 
 “We will round up offenders who had been arrested twice in the past three years. They will be arrested under section 151 of Code of Criminal Procedure. All police stations in the city have been instructed to take action to control crime and maintain law and order prior to the VIP visit,” Sharma added.
