As Team Gujarat’s tailender Pradeep Sanwan’s stumps went flying of a Mohammed Siraj’s slower ball, the Internet brimmed with celebratory memes and comments about the Hyderabadi fast bowler’s first Man of the Match feat in the on-going IPL on Saturday. It seems everybody knew this was coming — Siraj will castle Sangwan and we will post everything we have prepared till date online! And they did. #Mohammed Siraj began to trend, as opinions, comments and memes started pouring in lauding the 23-year-old’s match-winning show that helped Team Hyderabad storm into the playoffs. “I liked my 4th wicket the most. The wicket was a bit slow so I cut down the pace to prevent runs. Bowling with Bhuvi ( ) and Siddarth Kaul helped a lot. Bhuvi keeps advising on where to bowl to which batsman,” said a visibly jubilant Siraj after the match.
