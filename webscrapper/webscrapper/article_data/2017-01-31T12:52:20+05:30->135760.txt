VISAKHAPATNAM: The 69th death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi was observed across the city on Monday. Members of various political parties paid glowing tributes to the father of the Nation and a two-minute silence was observed in all government offices and educational institutions in the district.

  vice-chancellor Prof G Nageswara Rao was the chief guest at a meet organised by the Gandhi Studies Centre. Speaking on the occasion, he said Gandhi’s philosophy and idealism still held true in the 21st century at a time when people across the world were closing doors on each other. Later, a book titled ‘Gandhi Vision’ was released by guests present at the venue.
 
 Earlier in the morning, Gayatri   and MLBT Trust held a special programme on   where freedom fighter VR Maya Devi addressed the gathering. Speaking on the occasion, Maya Devi said, “Gandhi’s philosophy and views on peace and brotherhood would help the present generation take the right path.” She noted that by upholding Gandhian philosophy, the youth will help build not just a stronger and a more vibrant nation but also help in making the world a better and above all a more humane place to live.
 
 K Susi, son of Gandhian KS Gupta, said “Gandhi and his followers who built modern India were so strong and humane that they built a secular India with a secular constitution at a time when India was almost torn to shreds.”
