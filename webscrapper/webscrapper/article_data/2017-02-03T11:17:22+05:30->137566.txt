VADODARA: The   ( ) issued missives to owners of private properties on the Alkapuri side of the railway station to acquire land there for widening of the road. 

 The civic body will be compensating the owners of the property only with additional floor-space index ( ) and not monetarily. The VMC had recently taken up the initiative to clear the road line on the Alkapuri side of the railway station. 
 
 In coordination with the officials of the Vadodara division of the   conducted a measurement of the road line. The railways properties also fall within the road line and a notice was issued in this regard to the Vadodara division. The notice is only a formality as the railways has already agreed to raze parts of its properties within the 30meter road line.
 
 A major bone of contention for the road widening, however, was that of compensation to owners of properties on the other side of the road. The properties include lands of bungalows as well as a commercial complex there. A portion of one of the bungalows’ façade also falls within the road line.
 
 VMC officials said that the owners of the properties were insisting on monetary compensation. But the civic body has decided to compensate them only with FSI. “We have sent letters to the four property owners regarding our intention to open the road line. No money will be paid as compensation,” said VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao. He added that in case of a dispute regarding the ownership of the property, the FSI will be given only conditionally.
 
 In all, VMC will be acquiring around 1.2 lakh square feet of land here. “It makes no sense for people to go to the Sayajigunj side to catch auto-rickshaws or taxis. Such facilities should be available on the Alkapuri side too. The road widening will provide sufficient space for this,” said Rao.
