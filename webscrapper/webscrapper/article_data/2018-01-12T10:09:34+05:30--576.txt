AGRA: To reduce peak-hour congestion in the city, administration and the   police will together impart   to bus   and conductors about rules and safety measures. According to officials, most transport members forget the rules which are taught at the time of training, due to which they don't follow them often causing traffic mismanagement in the city. 
 
  In an attempt to ease traffic bottlenecks, the management of   National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) has planned to train their   staff with the help of traffic police.
  
  Talking to TOI, assistant regional manager of JNNURM Arvind Kumar Pandey said, â€œWe instruct our drivers and conductors to follow traffic rules. This time, we are trying to take help from traffic officials who can guide them better."
