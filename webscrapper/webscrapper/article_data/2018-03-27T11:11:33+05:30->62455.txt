GAYA: In a harsh warning, the   has cautioned the   against  . 

 The warning came during the hearing on March 22 of an MJC (1515/2015), regarding the removal of encroachments/illegal constructions from Gaya’s Gandhi Maidan.
 
 It was in 2012 that Pratingya, a local citizens’ group, filed a PIL in the HC, praying that the Maidan be freed from encroachments as it was the only big chunk of open space in Gaya town and, as such, had come to be regarded as the town's lungs, where quality oxygen was available. On account of encroachments and illegal constructions, however, the lung was getting choked.
 
 Pratingya filed the PIL through its president Brajnandan Pathak. A year later, the court directed the chief secretary to address the issue. 
 
 Instead of getting the encroachments removed, the government made an attempt to regularise the encroachments. The petitioner then filed a contempt petition, which is now being heard by Justice Ajay Kumar Tripathi and Justice Nilu Agrawal.
 
 In their order dated March 22, the judges said, “The court expects honesty in the affidavit which is filed on behalf of the district administration. ... If variance is found between what has been stated before this court and the actual work done, then obviously all the officials will be taken to task for perjury. The district magistrate must keep it in mind.”
 
 In legal terms, ‘perjury’ is the offence of wilfully telling an untruth or making a misrepresentation under oath. The offence of perjury has been defined in Section 191 of the IPC as a false declaration made during a judicial proceeding or under any other legal obligation. Section 193 provides for imprisonment for such an offence for up to seven years in the case of former and three years in the case of latter.
