New Delhi: Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president   on Friday said that the high court relief to the 20   MLAs was only “partial” and that   had not disputed the merit of the case. “The high court has only sent the case back to EC for a final hearing and not set aside the President’s order as such. This is a limited order,” Maken said.

 He said the high court decision to give the   another hearing was based on the “principle of natural justice” . He added: “The 20 MLAs can enjoy a reprieve for two more months. The   will fight the case again and put pressure on EC to arrive at a decision in a time-bound manner.” 
 
 Maken claimed that the MLAs couldn’t escape disqualification. “The high court has not denied the fact that lakhs and crores of rupees were spent on these MLAs, who call themselves ‘aam admi’, on perks like cars, offices and other facilities,” he said.
 
 He claimed that if elections were held for the 20 assembly seats, AAP would lose all of them. tnn
