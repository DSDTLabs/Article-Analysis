 “We got a call from a resident of Kaliawas about a black cobra in his house. It was difficult to believe as black cobra is very rare in this area. However, we immediately rushed to the spot. The snake was hiding behind a cupboard. We first put all the stuff in the house out and then rescued the snake,” said Anil Gandas, wildlife conservationist and founder president of NGO Environment and Wildlife Society.

They seldom bite but people sometimes get bitten when they step on the snake or try to catch it,” he said.
 
 According to Gandas, he has rescued only 10 black-coloured Indian cobras in the region in the past eight years. “Generally, spectacled cobra are found in the area,” he said.
