GURUGRAM: The   in Patel Nagar and nearby areas of   have been supplying   water for the past week, giving rise to health concerns among residents. 

 Residents alleged that despite repeated complaints to MCG and  , no action has been taken to fix the contaminated water supply. They have now stopped using tap water and are relying on private tankers to meet their daily needs. 
 
 A resident of Patel Nagar, Surendra Yadav, said, “The water is not even fit for washing clothes, let alone drink or cook with.” 
 
 “Initially, we thought it would be temporary, and decided to let the water flow for some time, hoping clean water would flow out after some time. But the colour of water never changed. There’s sewage mixed with drinking water supplied to our homes,” said Brajesh Singh, another resident. 
 
 One Prashant Yadav alleged that condition of water supply has worsened after MCG took over the supply in internal areas. “There is no one to take care of our grievances. Earlier we could approach certain people who then had our problems addressed, but now there’s no one to hear our issues,” said Yadav, adding that now Huda says they are not responsible, while MCG officials are clueless about facilities and issues. 
 
 An MCG official said the corporation will soon send a team to inspect the area.
