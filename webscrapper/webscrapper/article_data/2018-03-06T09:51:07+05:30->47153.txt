PATNA: A young boy was forced to do sit-ups and his wife made to lick her spit in full public view at   village in   district for marrying after elopement.

 The incident took place on March 1, but a video of the the meeting went viral on Monday.
 
  SP (Supaul) Mrityunjay Kumar Chaudhary said the girl’s grandmother has lodged an   against 11 people in this connection. The FIR says the village elders’ meeting ruled for the ‘punishment’ even though their parents, who were earlier opposed to the relationship, had approved the marriage.
 
 The couple eloped on February 16 and tied the knot in a temple. “After the newlyweds returned to their village, their parents accepted their marriage. However, certain villagers opposed it, and a meeting of villagers was convened,” the SP told TOI over the phone.
 
 Supaul DM   said police were investigating the matter and the culprits would be prosecuted.
 
 In October last year, a 54-year-old man in   district was made to spit and lick his own saliva and also beaten with slippers as per the ‘judgement’ of a villagers’ meeting for allegedly trespassing into the house of an affluent villager.
