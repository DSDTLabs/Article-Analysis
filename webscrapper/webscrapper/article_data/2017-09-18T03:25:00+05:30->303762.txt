Calangute: Deputy speaker Michael Lobo has said that anyone found dumping garbage in the open will soon have to pay a fine of Rs 5,000. Speaking to TOI, Lobo, who is among the directors of the Solid Waste Management Corporation (SWMC), said the corporation is in the process of drafting a challan book to collect the fines. There would be more stringent punishment for repeat offenders. The Calangute MLA said in Calangute-Candolim, the two village panchayats have started a door-to-door collection of garbage and bins have been placed all over. In Parra and Arpora-Nagoa, garbage bins have also been placed at regular intervals, Lobo said, adding that this would be replicated all over the state. TNN
