BHOPAL/JABALPUR: With contractual health workers on strike and the state-run medical network stretched thin, a tribal woman delivered a baby at the locked gates of a state-run health centre in   on Saturday. 

  There was no caregiver, let alone a doctor, to handle the delivery. The 25-year-old woman and newborn lay on a bedsheet spread out on the floor for a couple of hours. After the mother could get up, the family took them home. Both of them are out of danger. 
 
 Sources said that Bandana Kol, a resident of Masandha village in Katni, began having labour pain in the morning and was taken to the delivery centre at Bakal, at 8am. They were dismayed to see the gates locked. By then, it was impossible to take her anywhere else and Bandana gave birth to a girl.
 
 Katni's chief medical and health officer, Dr Ashok Awadhia, said, "There is scarcity of staff due to the ongoing strike, but a nurse has been posted at Bakal. When the patient arrived, the nurse was at the health centre, some distance away from the delivery centre. She is responsible for both. After getting information about the delivery, she went there and looked after the patient."
