MUMBAI:   arrested   Shivkumar Rameshchandra (35) for allegedly allowing two passengers to fly to   without the protector of emigrants’ clearance. He was released on bail on Monday. Police are looking for his aide, also an immigration officer. 

 Sources claimed he got Rs 10,000 for clearing each person. 
 
 The racket came to light on December 29, when Rameshchandra stamped the tourist visas of Arun Kumar Yadav (25) from UP and Mohuddin Berguya (24) from Assam and they were detained on suspicion. The duo confessed they were travelling on tourist visa to Saudi Arabia without showing their work visa. “They led us to agents Abdul Chaudhari (30), Yunus Mirza (50), and   (35), who were arrested in February,” an officer said. “The role of the two officers emerged during examination of the agents’ phones. Rameshchandra was arrested on March 6.” —V Narayan
