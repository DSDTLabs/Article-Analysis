LUCKNOW: Within a month of the deployment of e-rickshaws as feeders for   trains, Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation (LMRC) has witnessed a sharp hike in the number of   taking the Metro.

 While earlier, 7,000-8,000 passengers took the Metro every day, now, the number is 10,000-11,000 every day. This means that good connectivity will bring good footfall to Metro services. Encouraged by the increase, LMRC predicts that in 2019, when the entire 23km-long corridor begins, the daily number of passengers would touch 3 lakh per day.
 
 These feeder e-rickshaws will ferry Metro passengers from their homes to the stations.
 
 TOI was the first to report that LMRC has chosen erickshaws as feeder service to Metro because of its benefits to the environment and traffic decongestion. A Punebased company was roped in and the full service will begin by July. However, the company has already begun services on pilot basis early this month and deployed 19 erickshaws across eight Metro stations on the 8.5km-long priority section from Charbagh to Transportnagar.
 
 The e-rickshaws carry passengers to and from inner colonies of Metro route with charges on a par with other erickshaws (within Rs 10 for a ride). One can distinguish these vehicles from others by the green colour and logo of ‘Metro Mitra’ on the panel.
 
 LMRC plans to enable these vehicles with global positioning system, so that fares can be charged as per distance travelled by the passenger.
