PANAJI: The South West Port Limited ( ), on Friday withdrew its petition filed before the high court of Bombay at Goa, challenging the Goa State Pollution Control Board’s (GSPCB) order revoking consent to operate granted for coal handling at Mormugao Port Trust (MPT).

 Following the petitioner’s plea to withdraw and approach an appropriate authority against the GSPCB order, the high court disposed of the petition. The appellate authority for SWPL is the National Green Tribunal (NGT) under the Water Act and Administrative Tribunal under the Air Act. 
 
 During the hearing of the case, senior counsel  , who appeared for the petitioner, submitted to the court that his client is withdrawing the case to approach the appropriate authority.
 
 Kantak also told the bench of justices Shantanu Kemkar and   Sardessai that the alleged excess handling of coal had not caused pollution as made out by the government authority and that the petitioner should not have been stopped from operating.
 
 The board had issued the order on January 9 alleging that SWPL had failed to prove that it had handled coking coal/coke within permissible limits for the period 2016-17.
 
 The petitioner had sought a stay on the order.
