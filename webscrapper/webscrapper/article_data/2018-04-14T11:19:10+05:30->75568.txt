PUNE: Nearly 100 villagers from   have signed a petition opposing the township project and sought a separate hearing from   on the scheme.

 The villagers on Friday said legal recourse would be their option in the absece of the hearing. 
 
 The Mhalunge township has been showcased as a model project and allocated Rs 152 crore in the annual budget. It is slated to get Rs 629 crore from various financial institutions. Covering 700 acre and 6,500 landowners, the project will be based on the land pooling policy. This will enable landowners to get 50% of the plots after being developed by the   (PMRDA).
 
 The villagers opposed the plan claimed that they would not only be deprived of 50% of their land but were also not getting any benefit for parting with their plots. “Despite a letter to PMRDA in December, its chief, Kiran Gitte, has not held any discussion with the villagers,” said Ninad Padale, an affected villager said. 
 
 Padale, who has signed the petition along with 91 villagers, said, “The draft Development Plan (DP) for the town planning scheme was prepared despite stiff opposition from nearly 80% villagers of Mhalunge.” 
 
 Gitte, however, met the villagers on Friday and accepted their demands. He said despite publishing the draft DP of   village on March 24, they would accept any issues pertaining to the scheme. 
 
 “The draft DP was prepared in consultation with the villages. The amenities and final plotting were completed with the villagers’ name after taking them into confidence . The written complaint of the villagers has been accepted and we will look into it,” he said.
 
 In their letter, the villagers opposed the 50% ownership and said they were not ready with the present FSI announcement. It is unclear whether the FSI would be announced on 50% land or the whole plot of a land owner, a villager said. 
 
 The villagers claimed that it was impossible for PMRDA to complete the scheme within two years as its has stated.
