DEHRADUN: The state unit of the BJP claimed that the rousing response to the rally by PM Modi in the state capital on December 27 had “intimidated Congress vice- president   so much” that he decided to have his pre-poll meet not in Dehradun but in Rishikesh. “The venue has been deliberately kept in Rishikesh because in Dehradun it would have been impossible to match the numbers of the PM’s rally,” said BJP leader Jyoti Prasad Gairola.
 
  Gairola, also a member of the election campaigning team of the saffron party, claimed that all the parties like Congress, SP and   had to “rethink their strategies while planning rallies for their leaders.” “The choice of deciding the venue for star election campaigners of a party has become a delicate issue now, because the comparison of the turn-out and the response of voters with the PM’s rally will become inevitable.”
  
  On the party’s preparation for the forthcoming polls, he claimed that campaigning was going on in over 10,000 booths across the state.
