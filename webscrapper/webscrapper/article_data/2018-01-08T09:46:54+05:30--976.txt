MUMBAI: In the end, it all turned into a farce. As expected,   ( ) didn’t turn up for Day Two of their   semifinal against   (Bandra) at the Elphinstone pitch in Azad Maidan, which meant that the latter was awarded a walkover over the same opponents for the second time in a week.

 Rizvi Springfield will now play   (Matunga) in the final at the Wankhede Stadium from Monday. On Saturday night, SVIS had already expressed their unwillingness to play at the Elphinstone, citing poor ground conditions after they had originally failed to turn up for the second day’s play when the match was played at the Police Gynmkhana on account of Maharashtra Bandh on Wednesday.
 
 “After waiting for SVIS from 9.45am to around 11am, both the umpires, the scorer and match observer, deputed by the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA), took the decision to award a walkover to Rizvi Springfield,” said Mumbai School Sports Association (MSSA) cricket secretary Nadim Memon, who too was present at the ground.
 
 Memon cited precedence in this case. “In 1974, Bal Mohan Vidyamandir, who were led by former India batsman Sandeep Patil, were given a walkover in the Giles Shield final after Anjuman-I-Islam had refused to play them at the Shivaji Park. As per the by-laws, the decision on the venues for the matches has to be taken only by the MSSA,” said Memon.
 
 He hinted that the MSSA could take action against SVIS coach Dinesh Lad for speaking out in the media against the association. “As per our by-laws, if a coach speaks out against MSSA to the media, we can debar the coach and the school,” he said.
 
 Lad, however, defended his school’s action. “We had informed them we won’t appear for the game. In such cases, you always order a replay. Our point is technically right,” the coach justified.
