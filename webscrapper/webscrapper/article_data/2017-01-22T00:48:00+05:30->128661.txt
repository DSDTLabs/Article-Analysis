Jaisalmer: RSS, Bajrang Dal and Seemajan Kalyan Samiti along with other Hindu organizations and large number of BJP workers took out a resentment rally in Jaisalmer on Friday over BJP’s appeasement polices and working style of the district administration. Around 5,000 swayam sevaks and workers took out a rally and later organized a meeting at Hanuman Choraha.  In the presence of sangh pracharaks, saints and other leaders and workers, speakers appealed to Hindus to stay united and spoke about the double standards developing among Hindus and rising influence of minority community. Surjan Das Maharaj of Ramdwara ashram in Pali, RSS pracharak Ishwar, Bajrang Dal regional convener Indrajeet Singh and Sangh’s Bhagwan Das and others addressed the Hindu meeting. Few communities protested against the rally which created slight tension. After the tension, SP Gaurav Yadav, deputy SP Narendra Dave and STF reached the spot and controlled the situation.  On the call of RSS, Hindu Aakrosh Rally was taken out protesting against the government and administration at Jaisalmer. Large number of people from various parts of the state attended the rally that started from Mukteshwar Mahadev temple and reached Hanuman Choraha. In the meeting, speakers condemned the behaviour of administration with hindu community. BJP Pokaran MLA Shaitan Singh, Jaisalmer MLA Chotu Singh Bhati along with other BJP members were present among others. Hindu aakrosh rally samiti district convener Sharad Vyas said issues like cow slaughter, theft from temples, illegal possession of pasture lands, illegal construction of religious places from international border to city’s main road, open support to anti-religious elements to harassing workers demanding justice for hindu community were hurting Hindu sentiments. If all such acts are not protested now, the western Rajasthan border will become violent like Kashmir and northeast states.
