THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader   and former chief minister   have flayed the attack on the public meeting attended by CPM state secretary   the other day in Kannur.

 Achuthanandan said the RSS and the BJP were deliberately creating tension in various parts of the society to destabilize the harmony and peace prevailing in the state. All the democratic for ces should unite against the political violence unleashed by the BJP and the RSS, he said. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said that the Sangh Parivar had made clear its intentions in the state by unleashing violence even on the public meetings.
 
 When there is a need for bringing peace in Kannur the situation is turning more volatile day by day . The Sangh Parivar should adopt a peaceful and decent working style in a democra tic set up, said Ramesh Chennithala.
 
 Meanwhile, the alleged RSSBJP attack on the CPM public meeting has further worsened the CPM-BJP relation in Kannur.“The RSS hurled bombs when Kodiyeri Balakrishnan was addressing the meeting in memory of K P Jijesh, who was killed by the RSS workers and they defecated at the memorial,“ said CPM district secretary  , addressing a press conference he re on Friday . In the wake of recent incidents, the CPM would organize a campaign in the district, as part of which, public gatherings will be organized in 206 places in the district on February 3 evening, he added.
 
 However, the BJP district president   and party leader K Ranjith said the bomb attack story was a big lie concocted by the CPM. A leader of the DYFI from Thalassery was behind it, and the drama was created to save the party's face as it had been on the defensive following the murder of RSS worker Santhosh, they said. The BJP also alleged that there was rift within the CPM following the murder of Santhosh, and this gimmick was to divert the attention of the people.
