Ranchi:   in   are not too keen to offer voluntary healthcare service to children and mothers in far-flung areas of the state though under the Union health ministry’s Pradhan Mantri Matritya Suraksha Abhiyaan (PMMSA), they are expected to sign up for the programme. The scheme was launched in November last year in New Delhi. 

 The state chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), an umbrella body of registered private and government doctors, accused the state health, health education and family welfare department of not encouraging them to enrol for the programme. It has also said that they are not being motivated because of the Raghubar Das government’s reluctance to implement the medical protection Act (MPA) despite the growing violence against doctors. 
 
 “The MPA is not being implemented despite repeated requests and protests. Why should we think of the government? We are already doing our duty,” said Pradeep Kumar, secretary of the state IMA. “We had forwarded the instructions to all the district IMA branches. But who will take up responsibility if the doctors are beaten up?” Kumar asked. 
 
 Launched with the objective of supplementing the shortage of government doctors in rural health centres and providing better diagnostics, the   launched a national portal and a mobile application where the doctors could register themselves and visit rural health centres on the 9th of every month. This came at a time when states like Jharkhand had high maternal mortality rates, low institutional delivery and high under-five mortality rate among children. 
 
 The state government was entrusted as the nodal agency for monitoring the programme and IMA, the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecological Societies of India (FOGSI) and the World Health Organization (WHO) were taken on board to encourage doctor participation. However, four months later, the health department did not have an updated state level database to record the participations of doctors.
