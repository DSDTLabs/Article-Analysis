LUDHIANA: Alarm bells were raised at Mother and   inside Lord Mahavira   (MCH) when a lady delivered her baby in the porch on Friday at around 11am. The mother and baby are fine, but a scene was created at the Civil Hospital, and doctors were on their toes, taking care of both. The woman had come to the hospital for check-up along with her husband.

 The 26-year-old woman, Seema, who was pregnant with her second baby, had come to MCH for a routine check, along with her husband Sanjay, in a rickshaw. While she was walking towards MCH, she started suffering labour pains. She sat outside the building, and a security guard went inside to call doctors to attend to her.
 
 As soon as doctors came to know about the patient’s condition, they rushed towards the entrance, but by that time, Seema had already delivered her baby in the porch itself. She was immediately taken inside the labour room, where the placenta and umbilical cord were removed, and the baby was taken to a nursery for check-up. The doctors informed that the mother and newborn were fine.
 
 Senior medical officer at the hospital, Dr Geeta, shared that Seema had come from Jassian village, and she was registered at the primary health centre at Salem Tabri. She said usually during the second or third pregnancy, it happens that women fail to understand the urgency of the situation, and keep bearing labour pains. She said they consider labour pain as ‘normal’, and in such condition, deliveries also take place quickly.
