RANCHI: The   on Friday granted a provisional bail of six weeks to   president   on medical grounds. He got the bail for treatment of his illnesses related to the heart and kidneys at specialised medical centres in the country.

 
 "The provisional bail will be effective from the time when Lalu is released," said Prabhat Kumar, the former   CM's lawyer.

He was granted a three-day parole by the state government on Thursday to attend his son's marriage in Patna on Saturday.
 
 Granting the bail, Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh said life was important for any person, whether a convict or a common citizen. Prasad's medical reports showed that the conditions of his kidneys and heart were 'critical'. In such circumstances, Prasad needed specialised treatment, the judge said.
