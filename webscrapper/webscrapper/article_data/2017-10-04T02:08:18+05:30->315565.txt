NEW DELHI: Over 1,800  ,  ,   and filmmakers from across the country have signed a petition in support of JNU   Nivedita Menon, who has been facing   from the university authorities. The petition has been accompanied by a letter to the President of India, the chancellor and the vice-chancellor of the Jawaharlal Nehru University.

 The petition, initiated by Professor Judith Butler of the University of California, Berkeley and Columbia University’s Partha Chatterjee, recognises Menon for her academic work and her contributions in the fields of political theory, gender studies and social movements.
 
 The petitioners, which include names like Abha Dev Habib, Nandini Sundar and Achin Vanaik, claim that they are worried about the “hostile atmosphere created by the university administration,” which they say would harm Menon’s ability to teach, carry out her research and pursue intellectual collaborations.
 
 The letter claimed that Menon was removed as the chairperson of her Centre without being given prior information about it or even an opportunity to explain her position.
