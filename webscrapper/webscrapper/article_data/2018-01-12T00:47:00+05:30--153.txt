Salem: A gang of robbers decamped with   jewels and Rs 22 lakh in cash from a house at ATC Nagar in Alagapuram here on Thursday evening. 

 The house belonged to Ashok Kumar, 55, a senior manager in the MIOT hospital.
 
 On Thursday, Ashok Kumar went to Coimbatore to bring his daughter home from her college, where she is pursuing a bachelor degree. His wife, Jaisy, 49, who is a headmistress in a government school in Thalavaipatty, went to the school.
 
 When Jaisy returned home on Thursday evening, she found the front door of the house was open. She immediately checked the almirah and found gold and cash worth Rs 72 lakh were missing.
 
 She alerted the Alagapuram police. They reached the spot and started the probe. Salem city deputy commissioner of police (crime and traffic) P Thangadurai also rushed to the spot and inspected it. He also questioned Ashok Kumar and Jaisy. “Four special teams are formed to nab the burglars at the earliest,” he said. A case was registered and further investigation is on.
