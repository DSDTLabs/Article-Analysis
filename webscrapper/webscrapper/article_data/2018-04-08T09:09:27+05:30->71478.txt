 Traffic police don’t have night vision speed guns to shoot down over speeding vehicles during night hours. Recently, traffic police had installed an automatic speedo meter on trial basis to catch the overspeeding vehicles at the dividing road of sector 9/10 duting day as well as night. 
 
 This speedo radar came installed with a digital meter to show the speed on display board of vehicle that passed through the road and sent the picture of speeding vehicle at traffic line. After seeing the picture, police can send the challans to the addresses of the overspeeding drivers.
 
 Yash Pal Vinayak, DSP (traffic), said police have just held a trial of automatic speedo meter and if senior officers will find everything right, police will buy two to three of these to monitor the speed limit of vehicles at vulnerable points in city at night hours too.
