VADODARA: Panchmahal local crime branch (LCB) raided a hideout of burglars in a forest area near   of Ghoghamba taluka in the district on   and arrested four gang members.

 Several complaints of dacoities and house break-ins had come from Dhanpur and Garbada talukas in the last one week. Police had received a tip-off that the gang was hiding in the forest area near Ruparel village. Teams of LCB, special operations group (SOG), Rajgadh and Damavav police stations were deployed in the area.
 
 “On the basis of the information, we had cordoned off the area. Nine people were hiding in the forest and preparing to carry out another dacoity,” said Panchmahal LCB police inspector D J Chavda.
 
 On seeing the police, the burglars tried to run away. “We tried our best to catch all the thieves, but due to chaos and darkness, five people managed to escape from there. However, we have arrested four thieves,” Chavda said.
 
 The police recovered a country-made gun, live cartridges and sharp-edged weapons from Bharta Mohaniya, Ramesh Katara, Chhatrasinh Minama and Gursinh alias Guro Bhabhor. 
 
 They are residents of Dahod. The burglars admitted during their interrogation to the police that they were involved in burglaries in areas under Rajgadh and Damavav police stations limits.
