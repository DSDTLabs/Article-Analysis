Language is no barrier when it comes to cinema and our Sandalwood stars have been pulling out all stops to prove it. On Wednesday, this effort went a notch higher with Hattrick hero   making his presence felt at the muhurta of a   flick, Katpady Kattappa, in  . “I have been hearing of the remarkable achievements that the industry, which in spite of being so niche, has been making. So, when choreographer Rajesh Brahmavar told me about his new film and asked me to grace the occasion, I felt there couldn’t be a better opportunity to pledge my support to the Tulu industry,” says Shivarajkumar, who was felicitated on the occasion.
“I want to star in a Tulu film soon. I am told that sensible   is popular in this belt. So I’ve asked my friends to pen a comedy and bring it to me. While it will definitely cater to their taste, the film will also have a message. I’m eagerly awaiting that day — it is my dedication to the people of Mangaluru and beyond,” he sums up.
