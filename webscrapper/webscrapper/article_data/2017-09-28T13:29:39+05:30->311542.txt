RANCHI: Thousands of revellers came out on streets to visit the grand pandals across the city on   on Wednesday. 

 Usually the rush of revellers is seen only after sundown but this year pandal hoppers were seen thronging different puja pandals since afternoon. Even the dark clouds and a downpour in the afternoon couldn’t deter the visitors decked up in new clothes. 
 
 Visitors from other districts too came to the city to take part in the grand festivities. Sheela Kujur, who came from   said, “I have come to stay at my brother’s place for four days during which I will visit each and every pandal of the city and leave only after watching  .”
 
  The pandals at Bakri Bazaar, Ratu Road (made of coconut cover) and   (decorated by 3000 terracotta idols) attracted maximum footfall on the second day of the Durga Puja. The revellers did not miss any chance of enjoying a variety of street food — from local pani puri to Gujarati dabeli — being sold on numerous pushcarts near every pandal. 
 
 “There is no fun in pandal hopping if you do not taste the variety of street food on your way,” said Sanket Kumar, a pandal hopper. However, Durga Puja is not a carnival time for numerous police personnel entrusted with the arduous task of controlling the flow of traffic and maintaining order. The downpour in the afternoon kept the traffic cops on their toes.
