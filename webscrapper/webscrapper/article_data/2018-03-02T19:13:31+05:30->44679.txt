Model-Actress Gilu Jospeh has been in the eye of the storm ever since her   came as the cover photo of a popular magazine. As the discussions progress on her posture and on the ethics of modelling for a breast feeding campaign without her being a real mother, two cases have been filed against the actress.

 A criminal complaint has been filed in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kollam, by Advocate Vinod Mathew Wilson. It is alleged in the complaint that the picture is lascivious in nature, appealing to prurient interests and tends to degrade the image of woman.
 The complaint alleges commission of offences punishable under Sections 3 and 4 of the Indecent Representation of Women(Prohibition) Act, 1986. 
 
 According to Section 2(c) of the Act. another advocate, Jiyas Jamal from Aluva, has filed a complaint with the State Child Rights Commission against Gilu, the publishers of the magazine and the parents of the baby who was featured. According to the complaint, the babyâ€™s health and rights have been exploited.
