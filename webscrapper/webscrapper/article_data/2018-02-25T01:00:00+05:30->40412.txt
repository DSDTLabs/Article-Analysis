Don’t look now, but employee engagement in Mumbai is changing as you read this. Those blue sky meetings, office yoga gatherings and workplace laughter sessions are passé. The new action is in getting office-goers to roll up their sleeves and battle it, in a fun way. In a bid to boost employee bonding, bust stress and boost productivity, work places are adapting combat and skill-based games into the work week, where employees break into teams and try to outdo each other in fun ways. From ice sculpting to human foosball, bouldering and other games, here’s what the ‘official fun’ is all about... 

 
 
 Always wanted to pelt your boss or that annoying colleague near you? Quite a few corporates in the city are getting their staff to vent it out via laser tag. “It helps bust a lot of workload stress,” says  , an employee of an integrated marketing agency based in Andheri. “We find that playing games on the premises helps the team to bond. In fact, the theme for the year in our company is fitness. We started a cricket and badminton league and invited reflexologists to the office. The idea was to provide the team incentives to lead a healthier life. But of all the plans, it was the laser tag battle that had people having the most fun after working hours. There were four teams with guns, which fired infrared beams at infrared sensitive target jackets. It really was a blast, pun intended,” he quips. 
 Adds  , who works in a mobile marketing firm based in Goregaon, “The laser tag battle was introduced as an impromptu surprise for the company annual day in January. We used carton boxes to give it a feel of a bunker in a war zone, which made it easier to hide and shoot. We also dimmed the lights. Eighty employees were divided into teams, each having four members. We had 20 rounds. It was over in an hour. Our employees had been playing other games, but the game of laser tag at the workstation injected so much fun into the whole space. Everyone wants to play this again.” 
 
  
  
 
 
 Employees of a shipping and logistics firm at Chembur went the whole hog with their version of Olympic Games. Informs Meghna Sudarshan, manager with the firm, “We decided to have  , which turned out to be a day-long sport extravaganza. We had track events on a large ground, with a 100-metre sprint, hula hoop race, kho-kho, sack race and even dog-and-the-bone, which reminded everyone of the game of their school days.” The highlight of the event was the five-legged race. “We decided to get adventurous with the three-legged race and made it a five-legged one with five people together. It was excitement from the word go and encouraged bonhomie among the company members. I would definitely recommend it to other corporates, too.”
 For some, it was a chance to re-build focus. Snehashish Mitra, who works in a startup in Andheri, shares the team bonding activity in his workplace, “We are around 100 people working in the company, where it’s not possible to know each and every employee working there. So, we recently played a game where employees stood in a queue and passed around a bamboo stick with marble, from one to another. It was a new take on the good ol’ lemon-and-spoon race, but focus, strategy and team spirit was in full display.” 
 
  
  
 
 There are several advantages to having gaming activity in and around the workplace. Says organiser  , “Doing unconventional things together opens up corridors in the brain for a connection, within oneself and with others. It creates an opportunity to bond and explore hidden sides to each other. Fun and laughter triggers the right brain, which usually takes a backseat in a typical corporate job. A stimulated day of adventure, fun and bonding brings life back into the team, which in turn benefits the organisation with better productivity.”
