For the pre-party, she tried a grunge look. Her never-seen-before avatar was definitely new for us! She tried an ashy lip colour, smokey eyes and a high ponytail with partly braided hair. We must say that we loved her shimmery bronzed look!

 
 
 
 
  
  
 While at the Oscars, her make-up was more on the subtle side. Unlike before, she didnâ€™t for her favourite dark lip colour. She tried a girlie pink lip colour. Her make-up was light and more natural, she sported silver shadow to go with her structural white gown. She complimented this minimal make-up look with poker straight hair!
