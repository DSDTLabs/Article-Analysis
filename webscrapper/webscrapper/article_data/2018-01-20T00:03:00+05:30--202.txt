Chennai: Sixty-eight-year-old Gopal looked around the Vadapalani Murugan temple frantically searching for his son whom he had accompanied to the temple on Wednesday night in a car. His son, Subramanian, had told him that he would be “back in two minutes”, but till midnight he did not return having left with a friend on a scooter.

 Gopal, a Mylapore resident, was rescued by Vadapalani police inspector G Chandru, who was on night patrol, around midnight, two hours after his son had abandoned him. 
 
 Flower vendors in the vicinity told police that Gopal was brought in a cab by a middle-aged man who made him sit outside the temple. Pretending to accompany the elderly man for a while, the man left on a scooter with someone else. “Subramanian had left a food parcel for Gopal,” police said.
 
 After making inquiries, police found that Subramanian worked for a share-trading firm in Manali. He had moved out of his father’s house three years ago.
 
 Gopal, who used to be a two-wheeler mechanic, told police that he reached his son’s office on Wednesday but Subramanian did not allow him inside because of his shabby appearance. He made Gopal wait for a while and then took him to the temple, police said.
 
 “We are looking at the CCTV footage in the area to join the sequence of events. After rescuing Gopal, the police team called for an ambulance and took him to Government Royapettah Hospital. After giving him treatment, the elderly man was shifted to a shelter near Mangadu,” said Chandru.
 
 Police have launched a hunt for Subramanian. “The man might have abandoned his father thinking he was a burden. We are looking for him. He may be booked under Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act,” said a police officer.
