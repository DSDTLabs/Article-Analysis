PUNE: Former chiefs of air staff A Y Tipnis and P V Naik have described Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa’s personal   to air force   as a “prudent move”, stressing that the   needs to be prepared for any eventuality and make maximum utilisation of its current holdings. 

 Dhanoa’s letter asked air force officers “to be prepared for operations with the force’s present holdings at a very short notice.”
 
 Both Tipnis and Naik also said that the presence of the security forces in Kashmir was paramount to bringing the situation under control.
 
 In a telephonic conversation with TOI on Tuesday, Tipnis, who commanded the   during the Kargil conflict, said, “Sometimes, the chief only prefers to address fighting commanders. But in this case, the current IAF chief has written a personal letter to each serving officer, which is a prudent move as he wants to convey his message to serving officers.”
 
 Tipnis said, “The IAF needs to be prepared and make maximum utilisation of its current holdings. The current situation in Kashmir is volatile and a national threat for us. Security personnel getting killed is unfortunate and therefore, any person who throws a stone at security persons becomes an enemy of the state and needs to be treated harshly.”
 
 Comparing the current situation with the one in Kashmir in 1999, Tipnis said, “In 1999, the infiltrators had crossed the border and were present in the valley. Now, they are trying to infiltrate their men into Kashmir. Therefore, the presence of security personnel is paramount to tackle the issue.”
 
 Air Chief Marshal P V Naik (retd) said, “The incumbent IAF chief has highlighted some pertinent issues like favouritism; social networking, which need to be addressed.”
