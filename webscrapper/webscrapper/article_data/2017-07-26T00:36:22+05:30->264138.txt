NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from south and east corporations, the   has also decided to give   in all hotels and restaurants under its jurisdiction. 

 There are about 270 hotels and restaurants in different locations that come under the   corporation, said mayor Preety Agarwal. At present, talks are on with the hotel owners and restaurant associations. 
 
 The south corporation is the first civic body to allow women and children to use over 4,000 toilets in hotels and restaurants. 
 
 “We are in talks with the associations and soon, this facility will be made available,” the mayor said. 
 
 Agarwal said the decision would be implemented in 47 restaurants/hotels in Karol Bagh zone, 12 in Narela zone, 72 in Rohini zone, 34 in Sadar Paharganj zone and 14 restaurants/hotels in the city zone. 
 
 “This will be in addition to the existing facilities offered by the corporation. Stickers will be pasted in front of restaurants/hotels to inform people about this facility,” she added. 
 
 Meanwhile, the condition of public toilets managed by the civic bodies remains pathetic despite all efforts. Many of them lack basic infrastructure and do not have either sewer connection or water supply. 
 
 The three municipal corporations are also planning to construct public toilets at petrol pumps in their areas. The south corporation has already initiated the work and the other two will announce the move shortly.
 
 “The work has already been initiated for developing public toilets at petrol pumps. Besides, we have issued a circular announcing a fine of Rs 50 if anyone is found urinating in public,” said a senior official from the south corporation.
