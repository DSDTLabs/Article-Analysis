VADODARA: City-based   which had issued suspension letters to over 15 students on the grounds of non-payment of fees, on Monday withdrew the suspension letters after a meeting with members of the   ( ).

 The parents were agitated after the school last week had issued the suspension letters to the students stating that the admission of the students will remain suspended till the time their parents clear the dues of last academic year and pay provisional fees of the next academic year. 
 
 “We had a healthy discussion with the main trustee of the school Mahendra Shah and principal of the school. We are happy that the school has withdrawn the suspension letters unconditionally,” said VPA spokesperson advocate Kishore Pillai. 
 
 “Also, as proposed by the school management, we have agreed that any future dispute will be resolved amicably,” he said, adding that the parents’ body has taken the responsibility of ensuring that all the parents will pay the fees whenever the fee structure gets approved by competent authorities like the   or the Fee Regulatory Committee. 
 
 After the success that it received on Monday in resolving the dispute, VPA has appealed all the schools in the city to take a cue from the episode instead of taking harsh steps of withholding results of students or issuing suspension letters or leaving certificates.
