Noida: The   (BSA) of Gautam Budh Nagar has issued notices to 16 private schools for refusing to give   to students of economically weaker sections who were chosen through a lucky draw by the   office.

 These schools had   to obey the order to give admission to students under the   quota and are charging admission fee, building fee and other heads from the parents, officials said.
 
 According to the BSA office, under Section 12 (1) of the Right to Compulsory Education Act, 2009, the private schools are required to admit 25% students from the weaker sections of the society.
 
 “As directed by the DM, we have issued notices to 16 private schools which are not following the rule. There are 1,493 children who have been selected for admission in private schools through a lucky draw,” basic shiksha adhikari, M P Verma, said.
 
 They were selected after thousands of parents applied to get their child admitted to private schools through an online and offline process which began in May and ended in June.
 
 Some 16 schools are not admitting these kids for the want of admission fee, building fee and other charges, he said.
 
 Kamini Bhasin, president, Unaided Recognised Public Schools Association (URPSA), did not reply to queries from TOI.
