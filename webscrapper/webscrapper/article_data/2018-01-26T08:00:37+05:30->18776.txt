NEW DELHI: Congress president   came down hard on BJP after a school bus in Gurgaon was attacked by Karni Sena supporters over the release of ‘Padmaavat’ and said the saffron party’s “politics of hatred was setting the nation on fire”. 

 “There will never be a cause big enough to justify violence against children. Violence and hatred are the weapons of the weak,” Rahul tweeted. “The BJP’s use of hatred and violence is setting our entire country on fire,” the Congress chief said after a video of scared children crouching in the school bus targeted by hooligans protesting the Sanjay Leela Bhansali movie prompted nationwide outrage. 
 
 While Rahul abstained from commenting on the movie, two ‘Thakur’ leaders of the party from Madhya Pradesh came out in support of Rajputs protesting against the film. Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh said, “History should never be distorted.” Halfway through his 3,300-km Narmada padyatra, Singh added, “Any film that hurts religious or caste sentiments should not be made.”
 
 Another prominent Rajput leader of Congress Ajay Singh said, “Filmmakers should take care that the sentiment of a community is not hurt by what they depict in a film.” 
 
 Senior party leader P Chidambaram took a swipe at PM Modi for his attempts to woo investors in Davos, saying on the day the PM invited world business to India, Ahmedabad was hit by mob violence.
