Panaji:   have completed the signing of   midfielder   who will reunite with his former coach Sergio Lobera.
 
  Lobera coached Boumous at Moroccan top-tier club Moghreb Tetouan last season and was keen that the midfielder join him at FC Goa for the business end of the  .
  
  Boumous, 22, will replace Spanish winger Manuel  , who has now secured a loan move to another   team Delhi Dynamos. Interestingly, FC Goa are still to face   in the second leg of the ISL, and even though Goa recorded their biggest victory this season with a 5-1 demolition of Delhi, the visitors could still pose a problem or two when they come calling on February 21.
  
  “Boumous has already applied for his visa and should be here anytime soon. He was doing his pre-season in Turkey and is ready to help us,” said one official from FC Goa.
  
  Boumous is likely to be available for next week’s away clash against Bengaluru FC.
  
  Lobera’s decision to part ways with Arana, according to sources, comes from the Spanish winger’s desire to have more game time. Lobera is also understood to have been in favour of a foreign cover for Edu Bedia and Ahmed Jahouh in central midfield. And it helps that Boumous can easily slot in as defensive or attacking midfielder.
  
  FC Goa are currently placed fourth on the ISL table with 19 points from 11 matches and have a tricky run of matches before they can seal their place among the top four. FC Goa next play NorthEast United FC at home on Sunday.
