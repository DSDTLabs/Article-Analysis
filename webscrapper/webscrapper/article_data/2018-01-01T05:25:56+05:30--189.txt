MUMBAI: The fire brigade team investigating Friday's rooftop blaze in   said on Sunday that while the flames prima facie appeared to have erupted from the 1Above restaurant, they had not ruled out the possibility of the fire having started from the next-door Mojo's Bistro. 

 The fire that began in the small hours and caused 14 people to choke to death also reduced to ashes the two restaurants that operated with just a partition between them on the roof.
 
 The fire brigade said the picture would be clearer once the fire investigation report was out. The investigation is expected to take at least a week. Statement of numerous eye-witnesses - those who managed to escape unhurt and the restaurant staff, including the bouncers - would be recorded.
 
 "At the incident site, looking at the damage, it appeared that the intensity of the flames was the highest at 1Above restaurant," a fire official said, requesting anonymity. "Especially in the bar area, where all the spirits were stored. This could also be because spirits cause fire to spread much faster. We are also looking into whether the fire source was Mojo's Bistro and if it could have come and spread into 1Above. All possible angles are being probed into."
 
 In a representation to the PM, the CM and various other authorities, the 1Above management claimed that the fire started from Mojo's Bistro. 
 
 The two restaurants had been served notices by the local ward office of the BMC on September 18 for violation of licence conditions and serving hookah in an eating house without necessary permission, which it was said was dangerous to life and health of the general public and likely to create a nuisance.
