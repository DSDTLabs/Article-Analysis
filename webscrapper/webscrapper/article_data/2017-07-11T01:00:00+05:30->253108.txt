Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who has made a mark for himself in   as well as off-beat cinema, doesn’t watch his films once they hit the screens.
The actor, who plays a gangster keen to learn dance from   in ' ', says, “Once a   releases, I move on to prepping for my next role. If I keep watching my own films, it will either lead to self-indulgence or self-praise; in some cases, I might even spot some mistakes that will bother me. I avoid self-indulgence of any kind; it doesn’t let you approach a new role from scratch because there is baggage.”
 Nawaz also adds that in  , actors often glorify themselves, something which he shies away from. “If you sit with some actors, they start talking about the work they have done years ago, but I’ve never glorified myself. I prefer people talking about my work. What’s the point if I have to talk about it?” he signs off.
