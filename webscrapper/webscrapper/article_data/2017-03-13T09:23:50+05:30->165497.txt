HYDERABAD: Say goodbye to hopes of a bountiful monsoon and hello to a torrid summer. Following predictions by international   monitoring agencies of an El Nino-like event in the monsoon months of July to September, experts have predicted a hotter than usual summer followed by scanty rainfall in the city.

 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of USA recently predicted a 55% chance of   coming into play later this year. El Nino is characterised by an abnormal warming of the ocean surface in central and eastern equatorial Pacific, which has an impact on global weather patterns.
 
 According to officials from the  , there is a borderline or weak La Nina condition over the   since July 2016. Latest forecasts indicate that it is weakening further. “If there is a weak La Nina, there are chances of El Nino. In our country, this is usually associated with a weak monsoon and has usually led to drought-like situations,” a senior scientist from   said. The last four El Nino events in 2015, 2009, 2004 and 2002 had led to poor monsoons.
 
 According to experts from Skymet, a weather forecasting agency, the Pacific Ocean has shown a warming trend since 2014. “Going by statistics, the rainfall pattern in the city has changed. Unlike the monsoon three decades ago when it used to rain throughout the day, the rains have now become prominent during evenings,” Dr Umamahesh N V, a weather expert and author of ‘Changes in   and IOD effects on the extreme rainfall of Hyderabad’, told TOI. 
 
 There are chances of extreme rainfall this year too, but it would be restrained to a few days. “The summer temperature would rise astronomically and the chances of a bountiful monsoon seems far fetched,” Umamahesh said.
