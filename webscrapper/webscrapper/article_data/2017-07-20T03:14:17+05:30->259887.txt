GREATER NOIDA: The family of a scrap dealer murdered in May in an ambush this way on the Jewar-Bulandshahr road, in which four women were also allegedly raped, took to the streets in protest with black bands around their arms. 

 They accused police of conducting a shoddy investigation that has resulted in no arrests even after almost two months. 
 
 The family members, and local residents who joined them, marched from the village to Jewar police station in the morning, demanding the the arrest of the accused.
 
 About 200 locals, who were part of the silent protest march, visited the police station. They alleged the police officers have not yet given the forensic medical report to the family yet which indicated there was something fishy.
 
 The district administration and police had said the preliminary medical report did not indicate that the women had been raped. The police said they were yet to receive the forensic report from Lucknow.
 
 “My family members (eight of us — four men and four women) were going from Jewar to   when they were attacked by a group of criminals in the early hours of May 25. Four women members were gang-raped and my uncle was shot dead when he tried to save them,” said a family member, who was on the scene.
 
 “The police officers sought time for thorough investigation. Now we feel that the police have failed to get any concrete leads and they seem to have put the files in cold storage,” the family member said. Jagat Ram Joshi, CO-Jewar, said investigation was almost complete. “The police picked up several suspects. But we have not arrested the accused so far. We hope the criminals will be arrested soon,” he said.
 
 On June 16, UP Police chief   had said during his first visit to Noida that the Jewar murder-gang rape case would be cracked soon as investigations in the case were close to their conclusion. Singh did not share the details of the investigation.
