Kolhapur: In a bid to increase the state's share in UPSC, banking, staff selection commission and other competitive exams, the state government has announced to set up one coaching and guidance centre in every district for which Rs 50 crore has been allocated.  When TOI interacted with a few of the competitive exam aspirants from Kolhapur, many of them expressed their satisfaction with the announcement. However, there were also a few who had doubts over its implementation. Changdeo Patil, from Barshi, Solapur, is studying in Kolhapur for the past 3 years. He said, “The announcement sounds good but it should be implemented properly. So many projects are already pending for years. God knows, how many years will this take.” Patil said students need expert guidance. They need proper strategy when appearing for the competitive exams. “There are lakhs of students who appear for competitive exams every year. If we do not have access to proper guidance, coaching, infrastructure, books, we are just wasting our time. The coaching centres poposed by the state government might be a great reprieve for aspirants,” he said.  Sunil Dalvi, from Radhanagari taluka of the district, said that he has been appearing for competitive exams from the past two years. “This announcement, if implemented properly, will encourage thousands from nearby regions to sit for competitive exams,” said Dalvi. Due to financial constraints, many aspirants cannot afford coaching classes and hence do not appear for exams. “It is not their fault. They or their parents cannot afford it. The government should accept this reality at the earliest and work out a way,” he said. Amar Jagdale, another aspirant said, for success in the competitive exams, one needs patience, perseverance and proper guidance. “Hope the government keeps its promise and it works in our favour,” he said.
