JAMMU: Cross-LoC bus services on the   route between   & Kashmir and Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) remained suspended for the fourth consecutive week in the wake of ceasefire violations by Pakistan, an official said on Monday.

 A total of 116 PoK residents, who travelled on the Paigam-e-Aman bus service to visit their relatives in the state, have been held up here for the three weeks.
 
 The cross-LoC bus service was suspended on July 10 due to heavy firing and shelling from the Pakistani side. 
 
 However, there were no reports of firing and shelling by Pakistan troops in the Poonch sector since July 21. 
 
 Last week, the travellers from PoK had held a protest in Poonch town demanding the resumption of service “We have taken up the matter with the officials on the other side and the matter will hopefully be resolved soon,” a district official said.
