  Nitin Yadav, one of the cyclists, said, "Though we haven’t prepared much for this event, our habit of frequently participating in long-distance   events will help us set this record. Being a working professional, it does get difficult to follow a strict fitness regime, but we try to do our best. I use to cycle every day from 4am to 8am and that helped me build my stamina."

 Another cyclist, Yogender Singh added, "I’m a regular rider and have participated in various  , including LEL (London Edinburgh London). I’m participating in this ride as it’s the first such ride being organised in India. Cycling for 1500km in six days sounds like a big deal, but it’s just another ride for me!"
