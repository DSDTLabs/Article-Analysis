AHMEDABAD: They were young, motivated individuals associated with different organizations but working for the same social cause – human rights issues and upliftment of socio-economically backward communities. 

 For   (33) marriage or even a relationship was never on her priority list. “If I find someone who understands the cause I’m addressing, I may go ahead; else, there’s no hurry,” said Salve.
 
 Later in 2007, Salve met   (36) during a workshop in Ahmedabad. Two weeks later, Solanki asked Salve out. But she denied. Then they met after a year in Hyderabad and she reciprocated with her feelings thinking she finally found someone with whom she could not just spend her life with but even work for the same cause. Six months later Salve and Solanki got married on September 15, 2008.
 
 Unlike a traditional marriage, Salve and Solanki opted for a court marriage and decided to invest money for their cause rather than for mere rituals. Being outspoken about discrimination against Dalits and other backward communities, Salve and Solanki faced wrath of people in  , where they used to work, and at times, were even forced to vacate house. 
 
 “We work for an NGO that does not have an office here. We generally operate out of home and when people from backward communities visit us or we hold a meeting with them, we were asked to vacate our house,” said Salve.
 
 “It is often difficult, especially with our six-year-old daughter. But we’re committed to making a difference and as long as we’re together, we’re sure we’ll figure it out,” she added.
