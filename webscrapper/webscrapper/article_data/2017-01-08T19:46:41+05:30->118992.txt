CHENNAI: The Madras high court has quashed a   seeking directions to the   government to quash an order ( ) and reconstitute the search committee for selecting the vice-chancellor of Madurai Kamraj University ( ).

 A Narayanan of an NGO, Change India, filed the PIL to set aside the GO dated December 20, 2016 by the higher education secretary of the state government pertaining to the process followed in nomination of the search committee members.
 
 The PIL said M Ramaswamy, elected as the member of the search committee, had resigned after highlighting the irregularities in functioning of another committee member C Murukadas. It also said Murukadas was close to the beleaguered former chief secretary Rama Mohana Rao. So the selection process could be flawed, it said.
 
 “We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at length. In the midst of the selection process, we are not inclined to interfere merely because one of the members of the search committee has resigned. The tenor of the letter sent by the person who has resigned as a member of the search committee seems to suggest that his working equation problems with the chairperson rather than anything substantive. In the aforesaid circumstances the petition is dismissed,” said the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice M Sundar.
