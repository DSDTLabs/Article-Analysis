Umesh Shukla’s ‘102 Not Out’ brought the epic jodi of   and   back on the silver screen after about 27-years. The film, which takes the audience on a fun ride, collected about Rs 5.25 crore on its second day on Saturday, according to the report in BoxofficeIndia.com.

 The film is based on a Gujarati play by the same name, written by Saumya Joshi. The story, which revolves around a quirky father-son duo, Dattatreya and Babulal, essayed by Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor, is a slice-of-life comedy-drama with a universal connect. Apart from their age, what makes Dattatreya and Babulal stand out is their different outlook towards life. At 102, daddy cool wants to break the record of the oldest man alive — a 118-year-old Chinese —while his 75-year-old son has resigned to a life of drudgery and boredom.
 
 Speaking about the film, director Umesh reportedly asked the audience to celebrate life, no matter how old or how young you are, because these moments will never come back. According to the filmmaker, the audience will be reminded of the loved ones in their life — parents, siblings, children, uncles and aunts. Perhaps, they will understand and love them even more for all their idiosyncrasies. As for Dattatreya and Babulal, after the film is over, he feels the viewers will want to take them home.
 
 ‘102 Not Out’, presented and distributed worldwide by Sony Pictures Releasing International, and produced by SPE Films India, Treetop Entertainment and Umesh Shukla’s Benchmark Pictures, released on May 4.
