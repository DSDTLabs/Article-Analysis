 They claimed they came to know about the repeated assaults on Friday when she revealed everything after the driver tried to contact her again.
 
 The girl told police though she had been in touch with Aman initially, she stopped taking his calls last year. But he had been blackmailing and intimidating her constantly for meeting again, she alleged. Based on her father’s complaint, police took the girl to Civil Hospital for a medical examination that confirmed  . 
 
 Later, an FIR was filed against Aman under Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC at Women’s police station in Sector 52. Aman was picked up from his home on Saturday morning and produced in court that sent him to judicial custody.
 
 “We have arrested the driver and he has confessed to his crime,” said sub-inspector Manjusha, the investigating officer.
 
 Police said Aman, who owns a cab, had shared his mobile number with the girl in 2016. Though he started with friendly chats, eventually he insisted on meeting her. During one such meeting, he allegedly raped her. Later, he allegedly started blackmailing her, asking her to meet him again and again.
 
 “All these started around mid of 2016 when he lured my daughter and gave her his mobile number when she was returning from school. My daughter was trapped in the net. The driver lived near our home. Last year, she had stopped talking to him and started avoiding him. But he kept calling her, asking her to meet. When she refused, he threatened to kill her and other family members,” the father said in his complaint.
