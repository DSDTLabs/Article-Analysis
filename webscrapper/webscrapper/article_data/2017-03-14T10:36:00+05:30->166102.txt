HYDERABAD: With cash dispensing machines (ATMs) running dry even four months after the Modi government introduced demonetisation, many banks across the city witnessed chaos and longer queues on Monday as people jostled to withdraw money from the branches. 

 "The crowd is going on increasing for the last six days. It is three times more than what we saw before," said the manager of a public sector bank in Ashoknagar. People who resumed their work on Monday began queuing up early in the day, he added. 
 
 "I don't work on Saturday. So, I reached the nearest branch early thinking that I can take cash quickly. To my surprise, I saw that 30 people were already in the queue before me. The ATM attached to the bank did not have any cash. The crowd was just getting bigger by the minute," said Kumar Chandra (26), an IT professional, who stays in Hi-Tec City. Bankers said that people were questioning why they were being charged more for withdrawing cash from ATMs. 
 
 "Many customers are objecting to ATM charges and therefore, preferring taking cash from banks," said another banker.
 
 "I am a pension account holder of   and used my debit card in an   ATM to withdraw Rs 10,000. I got charged Rs 200 for that transaction. I was shocked as banks don't understand the problems of middle class people like us," Sanath Kumar, a retired employee from Dilsukhngar, said. Bankers say that the situation will worsen if people save money for future and only opt for digital transaction.
