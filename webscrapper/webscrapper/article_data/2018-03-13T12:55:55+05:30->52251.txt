PATNA:The city may soon get its third laser show venue with the state art, culture and youth affairs department planning to introduce the facility at Shaheed   near R Block. As of now, laser shows are held at Golghar and Buddha Smriti Park in the city.

 Light and sound shows will also commence at Babu Veer   at Jagdishpur in Bhojpur district. These initiatives are being taken to mark the 160th anniversary of Sepoy Mutiny, also known as Indiaâ€™s First War of Independence, which was led by Veer Kunwar Singh. The state government will also organize a three-day state function from April 23 to 25 this year to mark the occasion.
 
 According to historical texts, sepoys of three regiments stationed at the major cantonment at Danapur revolted and joined Veer   at Shahbad (now Buxar) and slaughtered over 200 British soldiers at Ara. Veer Kunwar Singh was then widely considered as the leader of the revolt against the British rule in the region.
 
 The stories in laser and light and sound shows at   and Ara will be based on life of Veer Kunwar Singh and events related to the Sepoy Mutiny. The narration of the stories will be in Hindi and English.
 
 The art, culture and youth affairs department has initiated the process of roping in private firm to run the shows. The department has set the target of April 15 for installation of the equipment at both locations.
