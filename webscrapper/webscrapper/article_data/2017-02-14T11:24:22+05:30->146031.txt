The MPs belonging to   faction on Monday sent a letter to Election Commission of India, urging the panel to reject the claim of V K   that she was general secretary of the party as her appointment was in violation of the party bylaws.

 The petition submitted by eight MPs pointed to Rule 20 (2) of the bylaw that states that the general secretary shall be elected by the primary members of the party units of Tamil Nadu, and members of other states and Union territories like Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. “Rule 43 states that the general council will have powers to frame, amend and delete any of the rules of the party constitution. The rule that general secretary should be elected only by all the primary members cannot be changed or amended since it forms the basic structure of the party,“ the MPs said.
 
 The bylaws also mandate that a candidate should be a member for five continuous years to become general secretary of the party, but Sasikala lacked this qualification, the petition said.
