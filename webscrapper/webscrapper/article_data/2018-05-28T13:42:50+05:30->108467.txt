In a recent initiative by Indian Railways, speed restrictions of 30kmph to 50kmph have been imposed along several stretches of tracks in the Northeast to treat a jumbo-sized problem — speeding trains crashing into elephants. The stretches where trains will slow down include 62 identified elephant corridors. Elephants are migratory by nature and move from one forest to another for food through these corridors, but trains hurtling down tracks that cut through such habitats have become a rising threat for them.

  
  
 
 Railway data shows that 70 elephants have died after being hit by trains since 2013. Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) and the forest department records say train-hits killed 16 elephants in 2016, and at least a dozen last year. Four elephants were killed when a passenger train hit a herd crossing the tracks in central   this February, the worst tragedy after five elephants, including a pregnant female, died in similar circumstances last December.
 
  
 
 Appreciating the initiative by Indian Railways,  , who plays an animal loving vet who is set out to uncover a deadly poaching racket in his upcoming film ‘Junglee’, took to Twitter to laud the efforts to protect the elephants.
  
 
 He wrote, “Congratulations to everyone behind this initiative, thank you @RailMinIndia @RailNf & @PiyushGoyal ji for being so thoughtful about the lives of our ELEPHANTS! This sure will help us save the mighty giants from tragedies in future”
 
  
 ‘Junglee’ is a family adventure film which revolves around the unique friendship between a man and elephant, adds Vidyut. Directed by Hollywood filmmaker   and produced by  , the film is set to release on October 19, 2018.
