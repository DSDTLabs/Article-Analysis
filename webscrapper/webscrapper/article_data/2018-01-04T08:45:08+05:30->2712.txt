UJJAIN: The RSS on Wednesday distanced itself from the violence during the Dalit agitation in   and said it was the handiwork of people who divide society for political gains. 

 RSS issued a statement late Wednesday night, calling for peace. "The recent incidents at Koregaon, Pune and various other places in Maharashtra are very sad and painful. RSS strongly condemns such violence and feels it is despicable," says the statement, adding that some forces are trying to create hatred and animosity among communities. "People shouldn't fall prey to such nefarious tactics. RSS appeals to the public to maintain unity and harmony." 
 
  "RSS believes in uniting society and the nation. There is no question that the Sangh did it (incite violence)," RSS prachar pramukh   told reporters in Ujjain, where RSS is holding a two-day coordination meeting with BJP, ABVP, Bhartiya Kisan Sangh and Swadesh Jagaran Manch. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat is attending the meet.
