 “On Thursday afternoon, when his wife went out, he apparently strangulated her two daughters Meenakshi (6) and Deeksha (4), hanged them from the ceiling and then hanged himself from the ceiling fan,” SHO said.
 
 He said that earlier it appeared that he hanged his daughters and then himself. But later on preliminary observations, it was noticed that he first killed his daughters and then hanged them.
 
 The reason behind this gruesome incident is not yet known, which has become a talking point for the neighbours also. One of the neighbours, not willing to be named, said that there was no tension or any altercation in the family, which could lead Devi Singh to take such an extreme step.
