MUMBAI: When Brazil is playing a football match, they may not always win, but they will definitely entertain. And the boys in yellow showed glimpses of what's in store at the U-17 World Cup by beating New Zealand 2-1 in a practice match at the   on Thursday. Wanting spectators to come in large numbers, the organisers of the tournament kept the matches non-ticketed, but perhaps having a 5pm kickoff on a weekday didn't help their cause as the stadium was largely empty. That didn't stop the Brazilians from giving a true exhibition of football though.

 Brazil started with a largely second-string side, but they had the New Zealanders on the ropes from the word go. Despite missing their star man Vinicius Junior (joining the team on Saturday) and resting another top-rated player Paulinho (ankle niggle), the Brazilians had no trouble in completely dominating their opponents.
 
 Striker   was the star of the show, scoring two exceptional goals in the second half to give Brazil the win. Brenner, who plays for Sao Paulo in the Brazilian league, put his team ahead just at the start of the second half.
 
 After receiving a through ball in the box, Brenner controlled it with his left foot, waited and drilled in a low volley with the same foot. The goalkeeper could only look at the ball go past him. The striker doubled his tally and Brazil's lead late in the second half with a well-executed move.
