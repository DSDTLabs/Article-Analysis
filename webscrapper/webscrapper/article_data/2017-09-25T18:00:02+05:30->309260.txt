 said although she would want to be a fun mother, the actor knows she is going to be a dork at the new job. 

  
  
 The 38-year-old star, who is expecting a baby girl, said she is a little anxious about motherhood. "Right now, I just feel so anxious. But I'd like to be the fun mom. I know I'm gonna be the dorky mom. So it could be kind of fun, too. I think that would be nice,"   said.
 
 The actor joked she cannot wait to be a mother as it will be the perfect excuse to blame people for bad parenting. "It's so easy to criticise parenting until you're a parent, so one of the nice things about becoming a parent is that I'll be able to openly criticise other(s') parenting because I will have a child," she said. 
 
 Kaling also talked about her mother, who passed away in 2012 due to pancreatic cancer, saying she would want to share a similar relationship with her child. "My mom was incredibly fierce and so devoted to us, just loved us and really wanted us to be happy no matter what we did." 
 
 "My career choice was not something that she was familiar with and she was just so supportive of that. And if I could give that to my child, just that open-mindedness, I'd be so happy." Kaling's pregnancy news broke in July.
