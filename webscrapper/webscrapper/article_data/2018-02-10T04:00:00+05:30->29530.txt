Chennai: After the Centre’s announcement of capital infusion for Central Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank, ratings agency Moody’s has upgraded its outlook on the banks to ‘positive’ from ‘stable,’ sending their shares up on the bourses. 

 After the Centre said that the Central Bank of India will receive Rs 5,160 crore and IOB Rs 4,690 crore in new capital, Moody’s revised its outlook. 
 
 “The positive outlook reflects the upward pressure that could develop on these banks’ long-term ratings, if their credit fundamentals — namely their capital positions —continue to improve over the next 12-18 months due to capital infusions from the Indian government (Baa2 stable),” Moody’s said in a release. Earlier, the RBI has placed the two banks on prompt corrective action (PCA) for decline in asset quality, bad loans, low capital and negative return on assets. tnn
