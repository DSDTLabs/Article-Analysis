NEW DELHI: Irked by the lack of response to steps being taken to curb child porn and rape videos on social media networks, the Supreme Court imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh each on Yahoo, Facebook Ireland, Facebook India, Google India, Google Inc, Microsoft and WhatsApp. 

  Making a determined effort to coax the Union government to make an online network for filing of anonymous complaints against circulation of offensive videos operational, a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Uday Umesh Lalit had on April 16 ordered these internet giants to file affidavits detailing steps taken to curb circulation of violent sex videos as well as child pornography content. 
 
 "None of these entities has filed anything to show us the progress nor any of these entities is ready with any response pursuant to our April 16 order," the bench said on Friday and directed them to file their responses by June 15. 
 
 The bench said, "The registry will accept affidavits filed by these entities along with cost of Rs 1 lakh each which will be kept in a fixed deposit for a short-term period immediately upon receipt."
 
 The proceedings had started on a letter written by NGO 'Prajwala' to the then CJI complaining about rampant circulation of offensive videos on social networking sites. The court had taken up the issue suo motu and appointed advocate Aparna Bhat as amicus curiae.
 
  Additional solicitor general Maninder Singh filed a status report on behalf of the government about the work done so far to make the online complaint filing mechanism operational and linking it with cyber police units in every state for prompt action against those circulating child porn content or rape videos. 
 
 The court found that substantial work remained to be done to make the system functional. "It has been stated that the beta version of online cyber crime reporting portal has been set up and the portal in its final form will be launched on or before July 15," it said.
