AGRA: The city came to a grinding halt on Friday as Congress vice-president   and Samajwadi Party president   took out their 12-kmlong road show to demonstrate their strength from Dayal Bagh, a BJP stronghold under the Agra North constituency, amid chants of “Ye hui na baat bhaiya“ and “UP ko ye saath pasand hai”.

 Targeting opponents, especially BJP, the UP CM said, “They cheated the country and country’s politics. Whenever BJP leaders speak, they spew venom.
 
 I and Rahulji want to defeat this politics of hate through path of development. Congress and SP will form the government. Our coalition will change the direction of the country’s politics. I thank Rahulji for boosting our morale.”
 
 Gandhi promised to throw BJP and RSS out of the state. “I want to talk of brotherhood. BJP only spreads hatred, tries to divide people. Congress and SP work for bringing people together. We will throw BJP and RSS out of UP.”
 
 The two leaders stressed that their coalition would not remain limited to the state level, but would only grow in the coming elections.
 
 Adding to this, Rahul said, “Today, I and Akhileshji, two youths, have come to change UP for the better. We will do so much development that after five years you will not be able to recognize it and think whether it is the same state. Akhileshji has done good job, he worked straight from his heart for UP. There are still works left to do and we will do that after forming the government.”
