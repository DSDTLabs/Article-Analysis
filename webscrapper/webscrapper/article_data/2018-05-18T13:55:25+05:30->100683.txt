PANAJI: Starting June this year, over 6,500 students at the Cujira school complex were to receive midday   prepared by Akshaya Patra, the non-profit wing of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon). However, details of the arrangement are awaiting the nod of chief minister and education minister Manohar Parrikar, who is currently undergoing treatment in the US. 

 “The arrangement will be finalised once the CM is back,” said director of education GP Bhat. “Land has already been identified in Bambolim to set up a community kitchen, where the   meals can be cooked.” 
 
 The state plans to supply a sumptious new midday meal menu to students of six schools at the Cujira complex on a pilot basis in Goa from the academic year 2018-19. Akshay Patra of Iskcon has received international attention for the nutritious and hygeinic meals it serves under the midday meal scheme to schools in Bengaluru.
 
 As of now, when the new academic year opens from June 4, the 110 women’s self-help groups engaged by the state will continue their supply of midday meals to all schools in Goa.
