INDORE: Getting a new electricity connection from Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra   Ltd (MPPKVVCL) will soon become a phone call away.   plans to announce a door-step service that would allow consumers to get this option on its 24x7 complaint centre number.

 “A consumer, under this new service, can apply for new connection without leaving their home. All they have to do is to call ‘1912’ and share detail and requirement. Their request will be immediately forwarded to zone office,” discom superintendent engineer Subroto Roy told TOI. 
 
 Subsequent to a consumer’s request, a representative from the concerned zone office of the company would visit their residence at a mutually convenient time and help the consumer complete the required commercial formalities like request form, affidavit and bonds etc. He will collect the requested documentation within a stipulated timeline. 
 
 After this, interim status or final status of the application could be tracked on the company’s website or by speaking to the customer service representative on the given number. The whole process, if completed properly, would take hardly around three days. 
 
 On an average the company receives around 50-100 requests for new connection, and around 1500 new power connections are issued every month. 
 
 The company has also launched a mobile application called ‘URJAS’ for domestic consumers to digitalize its services. Since, not all consumers are aware of the application, officials decided to provide a separate helpline number for its consumers. Moreover, it has also introduced offline windows at its zone offices for services like new connection, name transfer, meter replacement among others.
