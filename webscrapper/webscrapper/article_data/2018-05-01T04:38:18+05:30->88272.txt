MUMBAI:   has told the   it will not immediately take possession of a portion of open space belonging to eight residential buildings abutting   in Dahisar (east) for construction of a road over-bridge for   2A. 

 The 2A route connects Dahisar to DN Nagar and has 17 stations. The housing societies and a nursing home have challenged MMRDA's March 8 notices, issued to landowners of the plots, stating that a portion of the open spaces was going to be "affected for bridge alignment". 
 
 The petition says that the sanctioned plan for their plots shows the distance between each building, with Link Road and also the available motorable path for a fire engine or ambulance. If part of the open space is taken away, then less than 5ft would be left and an ambulance or a fire engine would not have access, it says. 
 
 "During emergency, hardship and trouble will be caused to the members of the societies as well as the patients at the nursing home," it states. 
 
 Before a bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla on April 27, the petitioners' advocate, Mehul Shah, said there are 3,000 residents in the societies and no clearance has been obtained from the fire brigade for the bridge. Asked by the judges by when possession is likely to be taken, MMRDA's advocate said, "We are not taking possession immediately.'' The judges posted the matter on June 11 and said till then "further action on the impugned notices" for taking possession shall not be taken. They also said that "MMRDA must satisfy if road line has been fixed".
