PANAJI: The Goa police  , which enables citizens to lodge complaints, hasn’t seen much response since its launch on December 19 last year. Speaking to TOI, crime branch superintendent of   Karthik Kashyap said they’ve hardly received 50 complaints so far, and most of them are related to traffic violations. 

 Chief minister Manohar Parrikar, who launched the website, had also launched the crime and criminal tracking network system (CCTNS), which helps police access criminal records quickly and also monitor investigations online.
 
 Police said that the idea behind the website was to have an online interference with the public and also to reduce the hardship of the public, who usually have to visit police stations to lodge complaints. Despite its lack of use for filing complaints, Kashyap said that the website is being used proficiently to obtain police clearance certificates, employee/servant verifications, etc. 
 
 Under the CCTNS project, the central government had allotted Rs 7 crore for Goa and the state has spent Rs 6.5 crore. The CCTNS project connects Goa police with the rest of the country and helps in easy access of all information related to criminals and their tracking. The digitisation of data is also expected to help in reducing the use of paper, as all data is now entered online and accessed digitally. 
 
 The citizens’ portal on the website contains information on Goa police like its organisational structure, details of stations, etc. The website also has information about FIRs registered at all police stations. In addition, the website also provides services like various clearance and verification certificates.
