NEW DELHI:   promoter   and his brother   were arrested by the economic offences wing of   early Saturday.

 Both the promoters of the real estate giant will be produced before the court at around 2pm today. 
 
 The Delhi Police had earlier filed an FIR against Chandra on the complaint of home buyers. Chandra is accused of duping buyers who had booked flats in his   residential project. The buyers alleged that Unitech had not completed the project on time and also did not refund their money along with interest.

 According to police, 91 people invested Rs 35 crores in the project but never got their flats.
 
 "The investigation of this case is being monitored by trial court. The investors had also approached the Delhi High Court," said a senior police officer.
 
 In January, a Delhi court had ordered a 1-day judicial custody for Chandra and other promoters of Unitech.
