SITAPUR: The mood was sombre in Talgaon on Sunday morning but fear was still palpable as just 24 hours ago, nine-year-old Qasim was killed by a pack of stray dogs. It was around 8.30am when the prevailing silence was again broken by loud screams, barking of dogs and wails of children who started crying in fear.

 
 Villagers, on alert round the clock, rushed out wielding lathis and guns. Minutes later, the ferocious dog was dead in the fields of nearby   village of   tehsil in   district, about 80km from Lucknow. The villagers were satisfied that the kids were safe and one dog had been done to death, but three others had escaped.
 
 The children were going to the fields when a pack of four dogs had attacked them.
 
 Dasauli is dominated by Sikhs from Jalandhar. Sardar Mahendra Singh said his hand automatically rushes to pick up his licensed doublebarrel if he hears loud barks.
 
 Another villager,  , says a pack of dogs had entered one house around 11.30pm on Saturday. “We all rushed and opened fire, which scared the dogs away. We have formed a team to guard our homes,” he said.
 
 Even after several combing operations, the threat looms large. Since November 2017, dogs have killed 12 children but the administration has no answers. The situation is similar in Govindsarai, Gurpaliya, Tikariya, Newada, Saraiya, Rahimababd and Badri Kheda. Children have stopped going to school, neither do they go out to play.
 
 Sitapur city magistrate Harsh   said 30 dogs had been captured so far by a team from Mathura that is being paid Rs 600 a day.
