BIJNOR: The crucial rail link between Najibabad and Kotdwar has been re-established with the construction of a new railway bridge that became operational on Saturday. The previous bridge had broken due to   during the previous monsoon in July last year. Almost half a dozen trains had to halt their journey and were not able to enter Uttarakhand since.
 
  On July 23, a pillar of the railway bridge, built on  , had fallen down. After a watchman informed the railway authorities, officials had stopped the movement of the trains passing through the bridge. About five passenger trains and   which pass through the bridge had not been operating since then. As a result, thousands of train commuters travelling from Najibabad to Kotdwar were facing difficulties.
  
  Divisional railway manager, Moradabad, Pramod Kumar said, “We have opened the bridge for all trains plying to Kotdwar.”
  
  According to officials, new bridge, which has been constructed at a cost of Rs 2.75 crore, is stronger than the earlier one and with a deeper foundation.
  
  The opening of the railway bridge is a huge relief for local commuters. KT Mani, a daily passenger between Bijnor and Kotdwar, told TOI, “I used to go to Kotdwar from Bijnor for some work. But for the past eight months, trains were not operating on the route, leaving us with the option of buses which are costlier and irregular.
  
  The passengers who travel from Delhi to Kotdwar were also facing a lot of problems. They could reach only up to Najibabad by train. From there, they had to hire a cab and travel to Kotdwar.
