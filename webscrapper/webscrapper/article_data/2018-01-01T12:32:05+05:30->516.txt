MUMBAI: Police personnels and railway officers were better prepared as the first Air Conditioned train made its first journey from   on Monday morning.

 The train scheduled to leave at 10.22 am left three minutes late from platform 4. Regular commutes of the Virar-Churchgate fast train leaving at 10.22 am were caught unaware as they waited on the platform to jump into the train.
 
 The train left the platform empty. The New Year added to the lack of rush on the platform and train.
 
 Gayatri   (62), a retried school teacher from Virar was among the first to buy an AC ticket. She paid Rs 205 for a ticket to Churchgate. A first class pass holder Nagpal said that she wants to experience the cool ride. “If the timing suits me I will buy an AC pass,” said Nagpal who commutes daily to   where she teaches dance.
 
  (RPF) personnel were posted inside the coaches. They went around telling commuters that only valid ticket holders could take the train.
 
 Three women commuters who travel daily to work to Marine Lines were among those who purchased the AC ticket. “We bought the ticket for experience. The timing of the AC train won’t suit us otherwise,” said  , a Virar resident.
 
 Commuters said that it was unfair to replace a peak fast train with a AC train that will run below its capacity.
