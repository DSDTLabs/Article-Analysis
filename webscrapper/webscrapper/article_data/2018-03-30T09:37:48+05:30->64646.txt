COIMBATORE: A businessman from the city did not know that a photograph he took of a   would help him record a new species for the first time in the country.

 Balaji P B, who was on a birdwatching trip to  , took the picture of the butterfly that was later identified as Erynnis pelias (commonly known as frosted duskywing). It was first discovered by John Henry Leech in 1891. 
 
  
  
 
 “I was in Arunachal Pradesh from February 17 to 25 with a bird watching group and visited Kibithu in   district. Around 9.50am, after hours of bird watching, I observed a skipper butterfly (from the Hesperiidae family) which was fluttering from rock to rock while periodically resting. I did not know the species but I was curious and clicked a photograph of it,” said Balaji.
 
  
  
 
 After returning from the trip, he tried to identify the butterfly using various field guides including BNHS Field Guides-Butterflies of India by Isaac Kehimkar, and a naturalist’s guide to the Butterflies of India by Peter Smetacek, and online forums. 
 
  
  
 
 “However, I could not match it with any recorded species. Then I referred it to a few experts. While the initial suggestion was that the butterfly belonged to Erynnis genus, exact identification was not possible. I then posted it to butterflies of   forum for further identification and it then turned out to be a new addition to the checklist of India,” he said.
 
  
  
 
 “When I clicked a photograph, I took a picture only out of curiosity. I am more into birds but I should say this is beginner’s luck. I am very happy that I could find something for the country,” said Balaji. 
 
 Appavu Pavendhan of Tamil Nadu Butterfly Society said, “The butterfly is recorded in southeast Tibet to west China. But very little is known of the species. This is a very good find, and it is the first time that an Indian butterfly watcher has recorded it.”
