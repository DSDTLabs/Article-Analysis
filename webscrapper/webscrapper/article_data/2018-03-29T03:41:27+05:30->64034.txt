MUMBAI: The shorter and more affordable regimen to treat the dreaded   ( ) will finally be offered to patients at treatment centres in the city. The therapy that got the   nod in 2016 will cut down treatment time from two years to nine-11 months, but there will be stringent criteria for patient selection, the BMC said on Wednesday. 

 On Thursday, a patient enrolled in Govandi's   will become one of the first few in the country to be started on the shorter regimen, commonly known as the  . This drug combination that is currently being tried in 14 countries grappling with drug-resistant TB will slash the pill load-patients on conventional treatment take around 14,600 pills in 24 months-by nearly half, doctors say. Patients also have to take injectibles for shorter duration of about four to six weeks instead of the minimum six months in the conventional treatment course.
 
 "The shorter regimen will be offered to patients who are not in the pre-extensively or extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR) stage, or rather have not been exposed to the second line drugs," said Dr Daksha Shah, Mumbai's TB Control Officer. In simpler terms, non-complicated MDR-TB cases, where the patients are resistant to first line drugs rifampicin and isoniazid, will be mainly considered.
 
 At the state level, a patient in Chandrapur has been started on the short course. Nearly 5,000 MDR-TB cases were identified in Mumbai in 2017.
