PATNA: Chief minister   will inaugurate the state’s first   –   ( ) – at a function to be held at Gyan Bhawan here on May 3. The institute has been set up on a 15-acre land on the outskirts of Aurangabad with an expenditure of Rs 25 crore.

 “IDTR has been established on public-private partnership (PPP) mode with Maruti Suzuki, which will look after its day-to-day maintenance,” transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said.
 
 The institute will accommodate 240 trainees and 10 instructors will conduct the training sessions. Women can also be accommodated in a separate batch. A hostel with a capacity to accommodate 100 students has also been set up. All the classrooms are equipped with audio-visual facility. The school also boasts of two virtual simulators – one for light motor vehicle (LMV) and another for heavy motor vehicles (HMV) – and a library.
 
 Different tracks, such as blind turn, S-shaped, V-shaped, H-shaped and eight-shaped tracks for LMVs and HMVs have been set up on the campus. A person wishing to learn driving will have to undergo 21-day training. Drivers wishing to acquire business driving licence, on the other hand, will have to undergo a one-day refresher course.
 
 Refresher courses for HMVs will also be conducted. “It will now become easy for drivers to acquire business driving licence. They used to visit neighbouring states, such as Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand, for the same,” Agarwal said.
 
 The transport secretary added that the department is also planning to conduct road safety workshop for students. “We will train unemployed youths in the Maoist-affected areas, such as Rohtas, Gaya and Aurangabad. It will create a job opportunity for them,” Agarwal said.
