LUDHIANA: The   branch of the National Federation of Blind which is hosting the 3-day national athletics meet for the visually impaired after a gap of six years, has appealed to prominent educational institutes of the city to send their students to the   to cheer for the state athletes. More than 800 visually impaired athletes will participate in the 3-day national athletics meet for the blind to be held at the Guru Nanak Stadium between January 13 and 15. 

 Around 114 events will be held during the meet in which players will be divided into three categories- B1 for totally blind players; B2 for players who can see upto 3 metres: B3 for the ones who can see upto 6 metres. 
 
 Balwinder  , general secretary of the Punjab branch, said, “We appealed to schools and colleges of city to bring their school staff to the stadium as it would be a learning experience for them to develop the confidence to fight all odds despite adversities.” 
 
 “I am sure once a student sees the enthusiasm of the players he will get emboldened to strive for excellence in every field,” he added.
 
 And Singh is of the view that it is the best platform for students who are low on confidence. “It’s best platform for the students who are short of confidence and are desperately seeking inspiration from the national level players. This meet will engage more than 800 national level blind athletes from 22 states,” he said.
 
 The Punjab branch has already made all arrangements for the players, he added. “We have sent a letter to the local administration and the health department for their support to the tournament matches and we have been assured of full cooperation,” he said.
 
 However, the track in the stadium is a point of concern for the athletes since the authorities have failed to renovate the track making the participants vulnerable to injuries as was evident in a recent tournament at the Guru Nanak Stadium.
