GURGAON: The owner of a city-based software firm, who was accused of assaulting one of his ex-employees earlier this year, has filed a complaint of   and cheating against him and his ‘accomplice’.

 In his police complaint, Puneet Kumar, the owner of TGS IT Solutions, alleged that Romen Arambam and Rajeev Vohra had used the company data to contact customers of a US-based client and lured them away. TGS IT Solutions sells software and services in collaboration with CTIC Global Inc ( ).
 
 Interestingly, Puneet is out on bail in a case of   and criminal intimidation filed against him, along with seven others, for allegedly assaulting Romen in January.
 
 Rajeev, of Delhi, had joined Puneet’s firm in October 2016 as a quality analyst, who allegedly had access to company data, including customer’s names and phone numbers among others. Romen, who hails form Manipur, was apparently hired in November 11 last year on Vohra’s recommendation. 
 
 “My company started getting a large number of complaints from our customers. My client also started complaining that their customers called and demanded refunds, which caused huge losses,” Puneet told the police.
 
 He claimed that during an internal investigation, it was found that their customers were getting calls from a certain number, diverting them to another website, www.softconesolutions.com, which is registered in Rajeev’s name and address.
 
 Based on Puneet’s complaint, an FIR has been filed under sections 66 and 66B of the IT Act at Udyog Vihar police station. Investigating officer SHO Arjun Dev could not be contacted for comments despite repeated attempts.
 
 Rubbishing Puneet’s allegation, Romen said this complaint of data theft was filed at a time when the police were about to file the charge sheet in the assault case. “They are just trying to mislead the investigation,” he added.
