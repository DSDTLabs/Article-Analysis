The trailer of   starrer comedy flick ‘Carry On Jatta 2’ is finally out. Just like the first installment, the sequel is high on confusion, comic timing and madness.

 The trailer will tickle your funny bone right from the opening scene, wherein Gurpreet Ghuggi and Gippy Grewal enter a place disguised as buffalos.
 
 Though the basic storyline seems to be the same, the roles of some characters have changed. In the first installment Ghuggi was Gippy’s partner in crime, but this time it’s  . However, one thing that remains in place is the amazing pairing of   and Binnu Dhillon. Stepping into the father-son role, the pair steals the show with their amazing comic timing. Also, with   on board this time, the glam quotient in the film has also notched up a few bars. And not to forget the famous dialogue, “Gandi aulaad na maja na sawad”, neither the movie nor the trailer could have been complete without it. 
 
 The trailer also gives a glimpse of the movie’s music. Must say, some peppy numbers are on the way.
 
 Scheduled to release on June 1, 2018, the movie will bring the madhouse back on screen.
