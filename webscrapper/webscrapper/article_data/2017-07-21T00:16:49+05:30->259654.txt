Hyderabad: Justice A Ramalingeswar Rao of the Hyderabad   pulled up officers of the AP government for not preferring an appeal to protect a 12-acre tank in Chittoor district. Referring to the extinction of Eguvacheruvu in Kasiraopeta in Madanapalli mandal, the judge said that private people could establish legal rights over this land by 1990 itself due to the state’s failure.

 The collector did prefer an appeal after 13 years in 2003, but the apathy of law officers continued and no record was produced in court. The judge found fault in this and dismissed the writ petition filed by Chittoor collector who preferred this appeal leisurely after a delay of 13 years. 
 
 The judge lamented that the tank cannot be revived now. “This court, in spite of its anxiety to do justice, cannot go to that extent in the name of extraordinary jurisdiction. This court could only do postmortem, it could not give life to the dead tank. The cause of death is known. The killers are left scot free. The beneficiaries have the last laugh. This writ petition shows the sorry state of affairs reflecting the conduct of state machinery and its law officers,” the judge said.
