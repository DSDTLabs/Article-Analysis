Coimbatore: The school education department has issued show-cause notices to 57 playschools in the district, which have not obtained permission to function. Schools that fail to respond to the notice will be shut down, an official from the district elementary education office said. The officials had identified 80 playschools that conduct pre-KG, LKG and UKG classes in the district. “Of the 80 schools, only eight had obtained prior permission from us to function. After we issued show-cause notices to the remaining 72 schools, only 15 had replied. So we have issued second notices to the remaining 57 schools,” said the official. If the schools don’t give a written reply for the second show-cause notices, they would take action to close the facilities, the officials said. As per the Tamil Nadu Draft Code of Regulations for Play Schools 2015, only if the schools met set criteria as prescribed in the draft rules, they would be recognised by the department. The rules say the playschools should function in a concrete building and the classrooms should be on the ground floor. Each child should have a minimum space of 10sqft.
