CHANDIGARH: In a far reaching verdict, especially for those rejected on medical shortcomings for joining  , the   has made it clear that "armed forces are best judge of its own needs as to who should be   to guard the frontiers". 

 The court further held that, "Government civil doctors may not be the best judges to opine on the subject matter or what a medical condition may mean in the most trying and toughest circumstances the forces encounter every day in unfriendly terrain and high altitudes."
 
 Justice   of the HC has passed these orders while dismissing a petition filed by Rohtak district resident Roop Singh (27), whose candidature for the post of constable in the ITBP was declared unfit due to presence of gynecomastia (enlargement of man's breast) and a surgical scar over the right forearm.
 
 According to medical literature, the disorder is caused by an imbalance of hormones, estrogen and testosterone.
 
 "When it comes to   of a constable, then only the fittest should be selected. The highest standards of physical fitness are expected due to arduous nature of duties. It is not for the court to enter disputed medical issues and apply the civil point of view on such cases," Justice Raina held in its orders released on Monday. Roop after qualifying all steps of selectio was declared unfit by the force in July 2016. 
 
 Later, he got himself examined at the PGIMS Rohtak. After conducting ultra-sonography, the PGIMS authorities opined that testis and epididmys (highly convoluted duct behind testis) were found to be normal and no focal lesian was seen in the left breast. The PGIMS also found all other organs of petitioner normal. His main contentions was that since a reputed civil medical authority had found no infirmities in his medical conditions, then the ITBP authorities could not reject him.
 
 The HC, however, dismissed the plea.
