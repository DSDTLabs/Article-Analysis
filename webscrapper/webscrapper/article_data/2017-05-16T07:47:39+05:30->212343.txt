KOLKATA: Vehicles on the road leading to Chandni Market from   came to a grinding halt for several minutes on Monday afternoon, when around 50 eunuchs laid siege to the   traffic guard outpost on Esplanade Row (East), demanding they be allowed to beg unhindered in the   area and cop high-handedness be stopped. 

 The Kolkata Police headquarters traffic guard has reportedly been asking the eunuchs to stop begging near Raj Bhavan and the K C Dass crossing, which apparently hindered traffic flow. "On receiving complaints, we had called some of them and told them we would not accept such a behaviour that hindered traffic movement," said a senior officer. One of the complaints, claimed Lalbazar sources, was from a senior government functionary.
 
 But what followed was beyond the police's comprehension. "Around 1.30pm, several of them sat down on the road. Some stopped taxis and buses, while others simply sat down in front of vehicles," said Sumit Haldar, a banker, who was crossing the area in an app cab. The police did try to disperse them but apparently did not "take strong action".
 
 The eunuchs TOI spoke to said they were driven to desperation. "We are threatened every day and some cops demand a portion of our income. How dare they harass us like this?" said Champa, one of the protesters. 
 
 While several motorists do apparently consider eunuchs begging at their windows "a nuisance", many believe this was one of the few ways they could earn a living. "There was an attempt to include them as civic volunteers but they refused, saying what they earned was much higher than the remuneration offered," claimed a senior Lalbazar officer.
