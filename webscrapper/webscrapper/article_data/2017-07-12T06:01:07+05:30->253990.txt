NEW DELHI: Signalling return of happy hours for tipplers on highways within city limits, the   on Tuesday paved the way for states to denotify highways passing through municipal limits to allow liquor vends to resume business. 

 The bench dismissed a petition challenging a March 30 order of the   and   high court, which had upheld the Chandigarh administration's decision to denotify stretches of highways passing through the city so as to permit liquor vends to resume sale. 
 
 The court recognised that there was no attempt to revive vends except those in city limits.
 
 On Tuesday, the bench said it never meant to ban sale of liquor on roads passing through cities.
