After investment companies, the government has decided to limit the number of subsidiaries of all   to two layers in its latest attempt to lift the corporate veil.

 While the government had planned to remove the cap through amendments to the Companies Act 2013 after intense lobbying by the corporate sector, it subsequently dropped the plan and has now tightened the norms at a time when it is trying to crack down on shell companies, which exist largely on paper and are often used for tax evasion and money laundering.
 
 Sources told TOI that the ministry of corporate affairs is set to notify rules to extend the cap on the number of subsidiaries to all companies, and the move goes beyond investment companies. The only excep tion that has been allowed is in case of a wholly-owned subsidiary. So, at best there can be three layers, explained a source. There is also a relaxation for foreign companies, which are being acquired. “But that does not mean that you keep floating overseas subsidiaries.“
 
 The sources said there is plan to allow for grandfathering of existing subsidiaries to avoid inconvenience to companies. Companies which have subsidiaries beyond restricted layers, will be required to file a statement before the prescribed date, which will be notified by the ministry.
 
 The issue of restriction of subsidiaries was seen as undue intrusion into operations by the corporate sector but the government is unwilling to change its stance. Sources said there is a very small proportion of companies that go beyond two layers.
 
 The issue of restricting the number of companies was included in the law after the   as   kept stumbling upon cases where companies routed and re-routed   through various entities and it often became difficult to identify the ultimate  .
