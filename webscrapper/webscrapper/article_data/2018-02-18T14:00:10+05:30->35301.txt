TRICHY: Continuing its crackdown against encroachments marring the architectural beauty of the 156-acre Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in  , Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR&CE) department has sealed as many as 15 shops that were functioning within the eight temple towers (gopurams). 

 With this, HR&CE said that all the encroachments on the temple premises covering 21 gopurams have been removed.
 
 After completing the drive on Saturday, officials added that similar action would be taken against shops that encroached temple’s space in 16 pillar mandapam and four-pillar mandapams situated in front of the Rajagopuram.
 
 According to the HR&CE sources, the department had been repeatedly instructing shopkeepers to vacate the encroached spaces where stalls, based on an agreement with the temple administration, were operated within the entrances of eight towers dotting the main temple complex.
 
 The shops were reportedly paying rents to the temple administration for a long time now. 
 
 However, ahead of the consecration ceremony of the temple in 2015, foreseeing the need to remove the shops that cause frequent bottlenecks, HR&CE in 2014 issued a termination notice indicating that the agreement between the temple management and the shops stands cancelled.
 
 Ever after the shops were served with termination notice, HR&CE said that the traders, mostly operating tailoring units and fancy stores were reluctant in relocating. 
 
 “Visitors to the shops established within the passage of towers around the temple were causing inconvenience to the pilgrims. Despite several warnings, the shopkeepers failed to respond, so we locked and sealed the shops,” joint commissioner of HR&CE, Srirangam, P   said.
