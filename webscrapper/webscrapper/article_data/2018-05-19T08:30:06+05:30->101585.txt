JAIPUR:   ( ) has passed the tender of Rs 108.74 crore for the Jhotwara elevated   on Friday. The construction of the road will start soon from Jaipur-Kalwara to ease the heavy traffic and a letter of acceptance will be issued to Messrs T.R.G. Pvt. ltd.

 In the budget of 2016-2017 the Jhotwara elevated road was announced to tackle the traffic problems in Phalnaâ€™s Jhotwara region. Hence, parallel to the Jhotwara bridge three lane elevated road of 2260 metres will be constructed. The road will cross Amababadi three lane from Panchayat Bhavan and will meet the bridge on Dravyavati river.
 
 The project is expected to benefit around five lakh people living in 1100 colonies in the area. This project also includes the expansion of the existing railways over bridge. However, hundreds of people will be displaced and 576 structures will be demolished for the project. This also includes six temples and four schools.
 
 At present to travel from Kalawar to Jaipur or vice-aversa public has to take Jhotwara bridge which is always full of traffic due to less width. After the construction of elevated road there will be direct connectivity for the public.
