CHENNAI:Three days after a single judge of the Madras high court refused to stall the release of Tamil movie ‘Thaanaa Serndha Koottam’ starring actor Suriya, film production house   – owned by actor Prashanth’s mother   has moved an appeal.

In August 2014, Staar Movies signed an agreement valid for three years with the makers of the movie Viacom 18, who also owned the copyright of the film, and obtained the rights to remake the movie in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and  .
 
 In September 2016, Staar Movies assigned the right to remake the film in Tamil to   Film Factory for a consideration of Rs 1.5 crore. But RPP failed to produce the remake within the stipulated one year time.
 
 Subsequently, Staar Movies came to know that Studio Green is making the Tamil version of the movie with Suriya in the lead role. Alleging that the remake is being made without their consent, Staar approached the high court. But noting that they petitioner has approached in the eleventh hour seeking an injunction against the release, a single judge dismissed the application seeking the interim relief.
 
 Now assailing the single judge’s dismissal order   has moved an appeal before the division bench headed by Chief Justice  .
 
 After recording the contentions of both the parties, the bench posted the appeal to January 10 for passing orders.
