AHMEDABAD: For   in Ahmedabad, and indeed around the world, January 1 is a climax rather than a beginning. The crescendo of expectation reaches the apotheosis at the very start of the New Year, the traditional opening day of   -  . The 2017 edition, being held at  , was inaugurated on Sunday. 

 In its concertina folds, the Saptak ticket preserves the names of legends. This year, performers will include Vidushi Shubha Mudgal, Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty, Ustad Shujaat Khan, Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, Vidushi N Rajam, and Ustad Amjad Ali Khan.
 
 Sitarist Vidushi Manju Mehta, the guardian of the Saptak spirit, is also scheduled to give a recital.
 
 A salient feature of the festival is that it lets young stars share the stage with stalwarts. As always, students of Saptak will show that the Indian classical legacy has plenty of deserving inheritors in Ahmedabad and other Gujarat cities.
 
 The festival, which will end on January 13, has always been a forum for exchange of cultural notes. Between performances, it is common to hear the polyphony of ideas and counterpoints in the forecourt of the venue. 
 
 It is orchestrated by conversations between readers and writers, singers and thinkers, students and gurus, and artists and their engaged disputants. The hum of intelligence is italicized by music streaming in from the hall. Of course, music dominates conversations - the rumble of a note taking a raga to, say, the lava pit of a lover's despair will freeze all other talk.
