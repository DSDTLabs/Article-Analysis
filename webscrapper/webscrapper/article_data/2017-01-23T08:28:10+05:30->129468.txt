PANAJI: Those who speak of curbs on   in the country should think of the Emergency imposed in 1975 by then-Congress government and vote for the BJP, Union minister   said on Sunday in Goa, reacting to the Church’s guidelines that speak of lack of freedom of expression in the country.

 “That is the Church’s view. The country’s view is different. I am happy when anyone talks of freedom of expression. People should use any mention of freedom of expression to think of the curbs imposed under Emergency from June 26, 1975, onwards and vote for the BJP,” Naidu said.
 
 Speaking about the breakaway group of RSS in Goa, Naidu said that it is wrong to think that a large number of swayam sevaks are part of this group. 
 
 “Swayam sevaks know what is in the interest of the country. There was some momentary reaction. But they realise what is good for the state,” said Naidu.
 
 On fellow Union cabinet minsiter Nitin Gadkari’s comments that led to speculations in Goa of Manohar Parrikar’s return as the Goa CM, Naidu said that one should not try to read too much into the statement.
 
 He said that the people of Goa should vote for the development of the country and for cooperation between the state and Centre. “The development initiatives in the state are visible,” he said.
