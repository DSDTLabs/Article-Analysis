Fake   begins to execute his plan of replacing the jewellery bought for Priyanka's marriage with fake one. He goes to Pinky's room and takes all the ornaments. 
 
 Just when he is coming out of the room Soumya spots him. She finds it odd for Shivaay to come out of Pinky's room, when he should be in the kitchen. Meanwhile, real Shivaay tries to break free from the room he is put in. 
 
  
  
 Anika finds Shivaay elsewhere and not in the kitchen. She asks him where he was, he tells her that he got an important call. He gets upset with the fact that Anika always has too many questions. Anika apologizes to him and tells him that she will make the french toast but fake Shivaay tells him that he will make it himself. This is because all the jewellery is kept in the apron.
  
 When Soumya comes to the table, she is told that Shivaay is making french toast for them. She finds it strange as she had spotted him outside Pinky's room.
  
 Real Shivaay is furious as he is not able to be with his family. He pours out his frustration on a woman, who finally gets him a phone. He calls on the landline, and Anika picks up the call.
