CHENNAI: The   registration department has brought about changes in the procedure for marriage registrations exempting the requirement of the presence of the couple's parents, which has been replaced by witnesses. The development comes in the wake of a section of sub-registrar offices demanding the presence of parents at the time of marriage registration citing a related circular issued in September 2017. 

 In a new circular on Wednesday, inspector general of registration   said marriages must be registered at the sub-registrar office based on the documents furnished by the couple to be married and witnesses, besides verification of names and address in the application form.
 
 The presence of parents as mentioned in the previous cicular drew objections. "But, none of the circulars in the past had said parental presence was mandatory. Some sub-registrars could have misconstrued it and sought the presence of parents during marriage registration which led to the confusion. The fresh circular was meant to clear the ambiguity," a registration department official said.
 
 The circular on Wednesday also clarified that   was not mandatory for marriage registrations. It specified that Aadhaar Card could be used as a document of identity but not as a mandatory document for registering marriages. The inspector general of registration further said death certificate, in case a parent was dead, should not be demanded at the time of marriage registration. "Instead, 'late' can be used as a prefix to the name of the deceased," the circular mentioned. Earlier, sub-registrars could register marriages only after verifying the original death certificate of a deceased parent. 
 
 Official sources said the circular on September 2017 was issued to stress on error free wedding registration, after complaints that errors in names and details were found on marriage certificates. But the circular seems to have added to the woes of the newly married couples.
