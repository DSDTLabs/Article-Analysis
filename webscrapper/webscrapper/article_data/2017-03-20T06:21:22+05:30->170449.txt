 Universities will have to provide details of the department, name of supervisor, the mode of PhD (part-time or full-time) along with the topic and likely date of completion. These details will have to be verified by the university authorities and made public. The UGC will maintain a list of defaulting universities who fail to undertake this exercise, the circular stated.

For instance, a candidate doing a PhD in Chennai can check if the same topic is being researched by someone in Madurai," said Professor  , head of the department of Indian history at the  .
 
 No state universities now has details of research output online. The finished thesis should also be uploaded so that duplication or plagiarism charges can be contested, a senior professor said.

 "Well connected people seem to get PhDs very easily. Uploading these details will make the process transparent," the professor said.
