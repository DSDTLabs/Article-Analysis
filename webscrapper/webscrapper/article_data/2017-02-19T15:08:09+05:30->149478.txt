 â€œParvathy was first put on daily peritoneal dialysis when she was four months old. The dialysis lasted for nearly 20 hours each day. After a year, she had to be put on ventilator and needed daily hemodialysis. But soon doctors said that transplant was the only option," Parvathy's mother Saritha said.
 
 While the adult kidney is nine and half to 11cm, that of a child is 4cm. Almost half a litre of blood flows in the adult kidney in an hour, which is equal to the entire amount in a child's body.
 
 "The solution was to remove her damaged right kidney and place the new kidney. We increased the blood volume in her kidney by specialised techniques," said consultant liver and abdominal multiorgan transplant surgeon Dr Mathew Jacob. 
 
 "I told my son and daughter-in-law that I had to do this for my granddaughter," said Parvathy's grandmother Sathi Raghavan, whose kidney gave Parvathy a new lease of life.
