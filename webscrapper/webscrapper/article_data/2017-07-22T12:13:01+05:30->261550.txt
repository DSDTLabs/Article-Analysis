NEW DELHI: India extended their medal tally to three during the   2017 with discus-thrower   claiming a Bronze medal. In the Women's F55 category, Dalal, at the last moment, managed a throw of 19.02m, just overtaking Baharain's Alomari Roba, who managed 19.01m.

 Dalal's throw was her best of the season. Though she was initially declared fourth, Chinese Yang Liwan's post-event disqualification resulted in Karamjyoti being deemed the bronze medallist, making her India's third medal-winner of the competition.
 
 
 
 
 Last year at the Rio Paralympics, Dalal didn't have the best of outings. After three unsuccessful throws, she wasn't able to get off the mark. However, the 30-year-old roared back to form during the Fazaa International IPC International Athletics Grand Prix in Dubai earlier in March where she clinched gold in the same category.
 
 Earlier,   opened India's account at the World   by clinching gold in the men's javelin throw event. Two days later,   added to the tally when he clinched silver medal in the club throw event in the F-51 category.
 
 Originally a part of the national Kabaddi setup, Dalal had to give up the sport after she took a fall from her terrace, that resulted in her losing her motor sensations for a year. But since taking up   in 2014, in two years Dalal has gone from being unranked to the top-10 in the world. 
 
 Currently ranked World No.8, Dalal secured a fourth-place finish at the IPC Para-athletics championships in 2015. With no support from the government, Dalal funding herself to the 2014 Asian Games in Beijing and won two bronze medals. She is supported by Anglian medal hunt.
