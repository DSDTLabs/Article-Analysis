MUMBAI: The state government on Saturday sanctioned Rs 7.83 crore for setting up 250-metre   at 50   (RTOs) across the state. This will include new test tracks to be built at Tardeo, Andheri, Borivli and Wadala RTOs in the city.

 This could be good news for citizens as the tracks will ensure only fit vehicles are allowed to operate and those not "road worthy" are taken off the streets. The test tracks will be used to check the fitness of commercial vehicles such as autorickshaws, taxis, school buses, tourist buses and heavy goods vehicles, officials said. This is being done as per directives of the  .
 
 A V Shenoy of the   said: “The funds should be utilised for proper technical testing of vehicles. I have been complaining in the past that RTOs do not have a foolproof mechanism for annual inspection of vehicles”
 
 Officials from Tardeo RTO welcomed the move, but said there were some “hurdles” in acquiring land for the test track. "Apart from sanctioning the money, the government should also assist us in getting adequate space to set up the infrastructure,” an official said.
