Kolkata: Bangladesh is going to relax norms for movie co-productions with India so that filmmakers from the two countries can work together keeping in mind the 35 crore Bengali population spread across the world, said Bangladesh information minister Hasanul Haq Inu.

 During an interactive session, Inu said he had already relaxed some rules to help co-productions where instead of two directors from the two countries, only one can produce the film. Now a film could be shot in a third country depending on the storyline. Inu said he would release policy guideline on co-productions on Friday while inaugurating the Bangladesh film festival. Both investors in a joint venture needed to invest equally and artistes from the two countries should be equally represented, he added. 
 
 \“We are trying to work out all hurdles in the way of joint ventures. There will be an appeal committee to hear complaints and all films will be released by the committee within 30 days,” he said. Inu felt telecast fee for foreign channels fixed by India was too high. 
 
 Filmmaker Gautam Ghose, who had made three co-productions with Bangladesh, proposed an escrow account where an Indian financier can contribute in dollars. “But it is difficult to strike a balance of locations between the two countries. I want to shoot a film in Bangladesh only. Moreover, investment cannot always be equal from the two sides,” he said.
