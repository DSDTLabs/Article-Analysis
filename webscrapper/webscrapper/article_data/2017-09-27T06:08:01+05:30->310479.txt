NEW DELHI: The home ministry may not yet have launched its `Twitter seva' - a forum for citizens to air their grievances on matters relating to the ministry followed by their redressal - but home minister   has made a small beginning by restoring family   to a freedom fighter's 102-year-old widow who had tweeted to him after it was stopped by the bank. 

 The   pension was sanctioned to Mohini Devi, wife of Man Singh and resident of Uttarakhand's   district, way back in 1981 but was stopped in 2011 due to non-submission of her life certificate.   had initially written to the home ministry, but it was adrdressed after a tweet tagging @HMOIndia on August 18.
