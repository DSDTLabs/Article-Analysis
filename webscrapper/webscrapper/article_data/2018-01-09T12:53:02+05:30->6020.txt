Days after the Union ministry of urban affairs told Parliament that Tamil Nadu has spent just 1% of funds sanctioned for the smart city mission, state municipal administration minister SP   said all the smart city projects are well on track.

 The minister, who held a review meeting on Monday in Chennai to assess the progress under smart city and Amrut projects, said three of the schemes under the smart city mission have been completed in Tamil Nadu at a cost of Rs 3.65 crore. “Out of the 173 schemes implemented under smart city mission, three have been completed. Tenders would be invited shortly for 37 schemes worth Rs 1,795.9 crore while work is on for preparation of detailed project reports for 119 schemes to be implemented at an outlay of Rs 11,134 crore,’’ the minister said, according to a statement issued by the state government. The review meeting was held in the backdrop of the report by union urban affairs ministry submitted in the Rajya Sabha a week ago. According to the report, Tamil Nadu lagged behind several other states in implementing the smart city projects. The report said Coimbatore city municipal corporation has spent a meagre Rs 7.27cr of the total Rs 500cr sanctioned so far and Greater Chennai corporation has spent just Rs 3.82cr. Madurai, Salem, Tanjavur and Vellore have spent Rs 82 lakh, Rs 5 lakh, Rs 19 lakh and Rs 6 lakh respectively out of the total Rs 277cr sanctioned for them.
 
 In an apparent move to defend the delay in implementing the projects, Velumani said the work was progressing in the right pace. “Schemes which are in the stage of DPR preparation, the work should be completed before March 31 and tenders will be called for. For those schemes that have reached the tender stage, bids should be invited for implementation by January 31,” Velumani told the officials at the meeting.
