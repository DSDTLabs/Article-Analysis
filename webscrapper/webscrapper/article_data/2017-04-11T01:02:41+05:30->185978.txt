Gurgaon: A fake   was booked on Sunday, nearly two months after an   was allegedly duped by it.

 Dr Charu Dutt Arora, a resident of Park View City, who recently shifted base from the US, had contacted a maid placement agency through an advertisement on Sulekha.com in January.
 
 Arora was coordinating with a certain Shiv of a ‘Seema Domestic Help Beoro (sic)’, which he later realised was a fake one. On January 26, the maid came with a certain Aryan, whom Arora paid Rs 17,000 in advance, promising to pay the remainder Rs 9,000 next day.
 
 However, the maid was found missing from the house after a couple of hours. Arora reported the matter to the police, who according to him, refused to lodge an FIR on various pretexts. Arora later posted the matter on social media, where he found that two other people had been duped in a similar fashion.
 
 Arora kept contacting Shiv Kumar who would receive the calls on occasions and but refused to return the money.
 
 On Sunday, an FIR was filed against the agency under sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC. ASI Krishan Kumar of Badshahpur police station said the verification process took time.
 
 On April 5, TOI had reported a similar incident which took place in Sector 9A when a doctor was similarly duped of Rs. 31,000 and jewellery by a similar fake agency.
