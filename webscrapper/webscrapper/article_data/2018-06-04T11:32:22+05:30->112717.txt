' ', starring   and   in lead roles, has been hailed for the performance by its principal cast, the tight screenplay, written by Meghna and Bhavani Iyer and Meghna's direction. The   and Dharma Productions’ film collected Rs 2.30 crore on Sunday, taking its grand total collection to Rs 114.89 crore.

 Meghna, who is the woman behind the grand success of the film, reportedly said that only when the film was completed, edited and ready, was she able to gauge the sort of impact it would create. She said that as a director, since she was so close to the process of making the film, she wasn’t able to see it in its entirety or have a more detached perspective. However, when she watched it for the first time, she was more than satisfied and in turn, it overwhelmed her. She was able to understand the impact of the tiny details and nuances of the film. It was saying a lot more than just being the story of a girl who was sent as a spy.
 
  
 Having seen a lukewarm response to her films such as her debut film 'Filhaal' and 'Just Married', Meghna said she realised that for a director to be able to make the film that he or she wants to, box-office success matters a lot.
 
 According to the director, "Unfortunately, there are two parts to every filmmaker's performance- creative part and business part, because ultimately for people, who are funding your film, it's a business.
 
 Elaborating further, she added, "They (producers) may want to reduce the risk, they may want to make as much money but nobody is going to put in money. Because that's what happened with me until 'Talvar' released. It was difficult to put together a film when my movies were not selling well at the box-office.”
