Jaipur: In a relief to former chairman of Waqf Board Abubekar Naqvi, the Rajasthan High Court on Friday directed the state government not to make any appointment to the post of waqf board chairman till an appeal against the single bench order is decided.

 The division bench of Justice K S Jhaveri and V K Vyas gave the direction in an appeal against the quashing of his appointment by the high court on December 4 last year.
 
 The single bench of the court had quashed the notification of March 3, 2016 nominating three members to the Rajasthan Waqf Board including its president Abubekar Naqvi on the violation of conditions of nomination. The other members were cancelled are Nida khan and Sayid Arforz Zaidi on a petition by Sayid Naseer Hussain. 
 
 The division bench accepted the appeal on the ground that the petitioner had no locus standi in the case.
 
 The petitioner had alleged that all the three nominations had violated the criteria for nomination. According to the Waqf Act 1995 there are certain criteria for nomination. However the government not kept in mind these facts while nominating these three members.
 
 Abubekar has been nominated to the board to the post earmarked for person from the field of social service and businessman under section 14(1(C).
 
 According to the bio data filed by Abubekar says he was a Physical Training Instructor (PTI) till he took voluntary retirement from Service (VRS) in February 6 20016. He has also mentioned that since 2004 he has been a BJP worker campaigning for the chief minister. The petitioners said this is a violation of the Rajasthan Civil Service Conduct Rules 1971 which bans a government servant from working for any political party.
 
 The other two membersâ€™ posts are for religious scholars from Sunni and Shia sects as per section 14(1) (D) of Wakf Act. However those who were nominated are simple graduate and post graduate.
