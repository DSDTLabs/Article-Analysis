BHUBANESWAR: Priyabati Naik, 21, of Ucchabahali village in   district was worried about the financial condition of her father. She became more worried after it became a hurdle in her marriage. Finding no solution, she wrote a letter to Prime Minister   and requested him to help her.

 Priyabati, second daughter of a class-IV employee of   government, surprised after she got a reply from Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) about her issue. The   had sent a letter to chief secretary of Odisha. Later the state government asked Boudh district collector to help the family.
 
 A government official visited Priyabati’s home recently and told her that a bank has approved a loan of Rs 3.44 lakh in her father’s name. She became happy and invited the Prime Minister to attend her marriage on April 24. “I am grateful to   Modi sir. Because of him, my marriage date is finalized,” she added.
 
 Priyabati in her letter apprised the PM about her family’s bad financial condition. “We are leading a financially poor lifestyle along with the burden of loans. In between this situation, my family managed to find a groom for me. But money has become an obstacle. There is no cash available in my father’s account,” said the bride, a matriculate. 
 
 Her father Sadananda works in the revenue department with a meager salary of Rs 12,000 a month. Besides the poor financial condition, he has a loan burden of Rs 1.8 lakh. So he was not in a position to get his daughter married off.
 
 “I’m glad that Prime Minister took note of my daughter’s letter and helped us. Now the loan has been approved for the marriage. We can’t forget his help ever,” said Sadananda.
