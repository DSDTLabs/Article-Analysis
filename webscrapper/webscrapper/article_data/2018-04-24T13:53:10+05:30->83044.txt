PANAJI: Less than a week after INSV  , the Indian Navy’s yacht docked at Port Louis, Mauritius, for emergency repairs, the vessel and its crew of six women officers of the Indian Navy are ready to complete their circumnavigation expedition. The expedition will culminate at  , bringing to an end a 21,600 nautical mile journey that began on September 10, 2017.

 “The steering gear defect on INSV Tarini has been rectified and the sailing sloop has completed sea trials,” an Indian Navy official said. “The all-women crew shall resume the final leg of the circumnavigation expedition in a few days.” 
 
 The yacht altered its course and docked at Port Louis, Mauritius, on April 18 after its steering system was damaged due to rough seas. The vessel was 112 nautical miles off the Mauritian coast when the steering gear began to malfunction, prompting the crew to proceed for repairs.
 
 “Heading back (to the harbour) post sea trials, all seems fine and in place,” one of the crew members said. “We are hoping to start the journey back home soon.” 
 
 Due to the damage to the steering system, the speed of the vessel was hampered and the crew had to use the smallest sail and other innovative methods to bring the vessel in for repairs.
 
 INSV Tarini is skippered by lieutenant commander  . The crew comprises lieutenant commanders Pratibha Jamwal and P  , and lieutenants S Vijaya Devi, Aishwarya Boddapati and Payal Gupta.
 
 The vessel departed Cape Town on March 15 and was expected to reach Goa in the last week of April. Now sources estimate that INSV Tarini could arrive only in mid-May or later, and may encounter rough weather due to the arrival of the southwest monsoon.
