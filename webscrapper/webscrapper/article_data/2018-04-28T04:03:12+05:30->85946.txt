NEW DELHI: A Special   court on Friday convicted   Limited (GIL) and its director Ashok Daga on charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating in a coal block allocation case. The sentence is likely to be given on May 1.

 
 The court said GIL and Daga tried to deceive Union ministry of Coal, Union ministry of Steel and the government of Maharashtra on multiple occasions in order to procure a coal block in Maharashtra.
 
 "Between 2000 and 2011 at Maharashtra, Delhi and other places, both of you entered into a criminal conspiracy. The object was to cheat the ministry of coal, ministry of steel, governments of India and Maharashtra for procuring allocation of 'Majra coal block' situated at   district of Maharashtra in favour of M/s Gondwana Ispat Ltd," held the CBI judge, Bharat Parashar.
 
 According to the court, the accused showed M/s Gondwana Ispat as a limited company and made false claims about its financial preparedness for an "undue financial gain".
 
 The CBI alleged that in 2000, Daga, as the company's director, wrote to the ministry of coal for the allocation of a coal block by falsely claiming that Gondwana Ispat was a "ltd. Company".
 
 
 To procure the allocation of the coal block, the convicts made a false representation before the 18th Screening Committee about a tie-up with financial institutions and a tie-up for supply of Iron Ore from Orissa. In the same year, a similar representation was made before the 20th Screening Committee.
