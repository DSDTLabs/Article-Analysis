NEW DELHI: With terror outfits like Islamic State, al-Qaida, Lashker-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad actively egging on Muslims in the Indian subcontinent to avenge alleged ‘atrocities’ against their Rohingya ‘brothers’ by Buddhists in  , the issue of heightened threat to Buddhist religious sites in India was discussed at the meeting of police chiefs held in Tekanpur earlier this month.

 Union home minister   himself raised the issue in his speech, cautioning that with nearly 40,000 illegal Rohingya immigrants settled in India, there is a need to be alert to attempts by jihadi outfits to reach out to them and set up a terrorist nexus with them. 
 
 He mentioned that there were many Buddhist sites and settlements in India and called for heightened vigil there.
 
 A series of bomb blasts took place at   pilgrimage site in 2013, which were later found to be the handiwork of Ranchi module of the Indian Mujahideen, an indigenous group of terrorists backed by Lashker e Taiba-ISI network. On Friday, two bombs were found again at Bodh Gaya shrine.
 
 During subsequent discussions in the DGP conference, it was agreed that Rohingya settlers in the country need to be monitored for signs of radicalisation and any links with terrorist groups. Stress was laid on preventing further infiltration of Rohingyas from Myanmar and Bangladesh, apart from cracking down on existing ‘immigration tout networks’ who facilitate their entry and settlement in India.
 
 Though the home ministry advised the states to identify Rohingya immigrants for possible deportation in August last year, its implementation is not seen as easy given the human rights issues involved. Rohingyas continue to face hostility and threat of persecution in their home province of Rakhine in Myanmar.
