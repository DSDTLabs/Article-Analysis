Lucknow: A man was duped of  ,000 in an online fraud on the promise of a job. Dubagga resident Manu Kumar had applied for an engineer’s job in a private company via a job portal in January.

 On January 2, he was asked to deposit a registration fee of Rs 10,000 which was refundable and then another Rs 15,000 for interview. “I paid the registration amount online through a gateway of the company and then paid Rs 15,000 for appearing in interview,” Kumar told media. After the telephonic interview, Kumar reportedly received a job confirmation mail from the company.
 
 However, another email from the company asked him to deposit Rs 5,000 for opening a bank account. “Need for a job made me deposit more money, but I sensed foul play when the company’s website crashed and the job portal also could not help me out.” 
 
 Kumar couldn’t trace the culprits from the telephone number on which his interview was held. Sub-inspector, cyber-cell, Vijay Sirohi said they would crack the case soon.
