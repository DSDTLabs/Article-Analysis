Mumbai: Three years after being accused of strangling her two-week-old  , a sessions   has   a 60-year-old woman.   had spent a year in jail before being granted bail in 2014. Her son and daughter-in-law, the infant’s parents, on whose suspicion cops arrested her, left the house soon after and have remained untraceable. 

 Defence advocate Prakash Wagh said the woman had been arrested on mere suspicion, with no other evidence. “We will move the Bombay high court to seek compensation,” Wagh said. 
 
 The prosecution had said that the woman lived with her three sons at their   home. Her son, Arvind, married Kajal and the accused was believed to be unhappy as it was without her consent. The prosecution said that on December 4, 2013, Kajal delivered the baby. Arvind had alleged that since it was a female, the accused was angry with Kajal and harassed her. He alleged that the accused used to slap the baby, Varsha, repeatedly press her nose and even threatened to kill her. Arvind claimed that at 3.45 am on December 16, 2013, when Kajal went to check on the baby, she found that she was strangled with a piece of cloth. He stated that the window was open. Arvind said the cops were immediately called and the infant was taken to Rajawadi hospital, where she was declared dead. Arvind and Kajal suspected the accused murdered their baby. 
 
 Wagh said that despite the cop’s repeated efforts, Arvind and Kajal could not be traced. “The other son of the accused denied the allegations. He told the court that his mother did not mistreat her daughter in law and was very fond of the infant,” he said. He said that there was no evidence to show that she was responsible for the baby’s death.
