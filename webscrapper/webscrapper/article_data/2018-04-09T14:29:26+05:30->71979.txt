MADURAI: District authorities are searching for a suitable site to establish bus ports, following the announcement made by the chief minister Eddapadi K Palaniswami on March 30 that, state-of-the-art bus ports would be established in Madurai, Salem and Coimbatore.

 The chief minister announced the project and added that the work will commence soon while he was in the city recently to conduct mass wedding for 120 couples as part of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s 70th birth anniversary.
 
 As much as 50 acres would be required for setting up this facility, which will be on the lines of an airport, with upgraded facilities for the benefit of travelers. A team of officials including minister R B Udayakumar and   collector K Veera Raghava Rao inspected some sites in Madurai on Saturday. It included a 22.70 hectare (56.08 acres) site in   village, on the   –   road, in Thirumangalam constituency. Another site in Melakuyilkudi village which is situated 11 kms away from the Periyar bus stand, with 22.14 hectares (54.69 acres) under the Thiruparankundram assembly constituency and also a site near the MGR bus stand in Madurai north constituency.
 
 Though the estimate for the bus port is yet to be announced, sources say that it would be a state of art structure, which would have WiFi connectivity, escalators and dedicated bus bays and many passenger amenities like air-conditioned waiting halls.
 
 A list of the selected places will be sent to the central government, and a technical committee would come and review each site and finalise the place, following which the bus port would be constructed on it said minister Udayakumar, who inspected three sites.
