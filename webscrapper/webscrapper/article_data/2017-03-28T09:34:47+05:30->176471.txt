NEW DELHI: Two youths were killed and two injured when their   spun out of control, hit a divider and then flipped in the air on the Mukundpur   in   early on Monday. The victims were returning home after attending a party, said the police. 

 A passerby informed the police about the accident around 2.30am. A team soon reached the spot and pulled all four out of the badly damaged car with the help of locals. The victims were taken to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital, where Ankit (27) and Nayan (28) were declared brought dead while Ashish (29) and Saurav (30) are said to be out of danger. 
 
 The police said the youths were returning home at Mukarba Chowk. Two brothers, Ankit and Ashish, shifted to Delhi a year ago from Uttar Pradesh’s Badaun area and used to stay together. Cops said Saurav, also from Badaun, and Nayan, who was from Burari’s Satya Vihar, also stayed in the same area. All of them were business partners. 
 
 The police are trying to find out who won the white Honda City, which has a Uttarakhand numberplate. The doctors have still not declared Ashish and Saurav fit to give statements. “Both were trapped at the back seat of the car,” said a senior officer. 
 
 The police are waiting for medical reports to determine if the youths were drunk. The bodies were handed over to the families in the afternoon after the postmortem.
