HYDERABAD: AIMIM leader and   Asaduddin Owaisi said a third front comprising non-BJP and non-Congress parties was the need of the hour for the 2019 elections and TRS leader   could make this happen. “Though we opposed K Chandrasekhar Rao, we have seen that he has achieved Telangana state. We realize that he has the political sagacity to bring together all regional parties to play a crucial role in the next government formation at the centre,” he said.

  
  
 Reacting to the statement of K Chandrasekhar Rao made on March 3 that there was a political vacuum in the country, Owasi said this vacuum could appropriately be filled by the initiative that the Telangana chief minister should take in bringing all regional parties together.
 
 “It will certainly be a important role both pre-election and post-election,” he said. Asked at a press conference on Sunday whether K Chandrasekhar Rao would be a  ,   said the talk had just begun about all regional parties coming together and that is a question that should not arise now.
 
 Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday had made a strong statement that he would play a role in national politics. “What prevents us? Are we not capable?” he had said. He also added: “Can’t I speak English and Hindi like they do? I will make all of you proud,” he told reporters.
 
 Asaduddin Owaisi chose to highlight the role that Chandrasekhar Rao could definitely play in national politics. “I am like a Twinkle Twinkle Little star, so don’t talk about how big a role I can play. Through his qualitative governance, KCR has shown that can be done. He definitely has our support and he can make the third front happen. He has proved all pessimists wrong with the qualitative rule that he has provided,” he said.
 
 In reply to a question, Asadudin Owaisi chose not to immediately say if the   would also be part of the coalition of regional parties. “KCR is bold and far sighted. He should go ahead and bring all regional parties together on to a platform,” he said.
