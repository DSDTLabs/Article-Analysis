GURUGRAM: The city is likely to witness dust storms and thunderstorms on Sunday due to a western disturbance which has hit Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand. It is also expected to bring drizzles in Punjab. According to officials of Regional Weather Forecasting Station, the dust storms would arrest the steady rise in mercury. 

 On Saturday, maximum   was 31 degrees Celcius and the air was humid. Officials said it was because of heavy cloud cover which trapped solar radiations in the earth’s atmosphere. The temperatures on Sunday would be within a pleasant range due to north-westerly winds set to enter   from Punjab and J&K. “On Sunday, maximum temperatures might drop to 27-28 degrees Celsius,” said an official, adding, “From Monday, the clear skies will prompt a slight rise in temperature but it won’t be unusually warm.” 
 
 Officials said there might be mild, sporadic rainfall at isolated places in NCR. “For the rest of the week, temperatures would stay at 30-31 degrees Celcius,” said an official.
