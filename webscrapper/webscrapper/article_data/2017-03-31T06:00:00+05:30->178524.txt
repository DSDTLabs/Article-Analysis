The three-day   celebrations at   ended with an enthralling   performance by Smitha Madhav’s students on Wednesday. The city danseuse was definitely a crowd-puller on the concluding day — the audience reached the venue hours before the recital. However, many were disheartened to learn that the dancer 
wouldn’t be performing as she was mourning the loss of a family member. 
 Smitha, however, put her students up on the stage to perform the recital titled ‘Ruthu Shobha’. The thirty-minute production composed specifically for the occasion encompassed various facets of Ugadi. It began with a group of girls and boys depicting a rustic scene that had girls preparing for the festive season and how the village folk welcome the New Year. This was followed by a segment that celebrated the beginning of spring and welcomed the new year paying an ode to mother nature. The sun god was brought on stage on a palanquin, as the dancers paid homage by depicting the sun rise over the hills and impersonating cuckoos singing. 
 Dressed in bright orange, red, blue and green the girls wove themselves into varying formations drawing loud applause from the audience. As a final piece, the troupe performed the   about Lord Rama, which is one of the few songs were Rama is described as a toddler learning to walk, eliciting a thunderous applause.
