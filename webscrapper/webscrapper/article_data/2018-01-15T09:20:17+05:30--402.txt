MELBOURNE: Midway through the second set   broke free. The 25-year-old started mixing-up solid baseline play with forays into the net. Down a set, he won four straight games in the second against Canada's   to push the final qualifying match of the Australian Open into a deciding third set, where he displayed a smart and slick end game.

 The Delhi-based Bhambri rallied to score a 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 win in just under 2 hours to make the main draw of the opening Slam of the year for the third time. The other Indian in the day's schedule, 23-year-old Ramkumar Ramanathan, however, went down fighting to the fifth seed in the qualifying competition   of Canada 4-6, 6-4, 4-6.
 
 "I was nervous at the start of the match, and then in the second set I thought there was nothing else to do but to swing and to try and put a few more balls on the court," the 25-year-old said. "I started thinking a bit more, playing with more thought."
 
 Bhambri, ranked 121, came through the qualifiers at   in 2015 and made the cut in the 2016. "I don't want to sound arrogant, but anything less than qualifying would have been a poor tournament for me," he said. "Now I am looking at doing some damage, winning a couple of rounds in the main draw. That's where a year like last year comes in, when you work so hard and get the results on the tour, it does a lot for your confidence."
 
 Bhambri shrugged off the weight of expectation that comes with being the only Indian in the field. "I don't feel any extra pressure, I'm not thinking of being the only Indian or that there was another Indian in the final round of qualifying. I am just trying to do the best I can."
 
 On Monday, in the first round of the main draw, Bhambri will go up against the 32-year-old Cypriot  . The two have never met. "I hope I can carry this form into the main draw. Anything is possible, I have just got to play well."
