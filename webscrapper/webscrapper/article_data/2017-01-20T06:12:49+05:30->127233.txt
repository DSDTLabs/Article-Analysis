LUCKNOW: Mafia-turned-politician   and  , who is in jail for the alleged murder of his wife Sara, are unlikely to get ticket in the final list of the   candidates. The SP is expected to announce its first list on Friday. 

 Apparently aware that his name has been dropped from the list, Atiq said he was willing to sacrifice anything to ensure that Akhilesh Yadav’s clean image was not challenged. “I will not contest the elections and instead work to ensure that the secular votes do not get divided,” Atiq told reporters on Thursday. Hinting that he may stake claim for SP ticket in the next Lok Sabha elections, Atiq said he will prepare for the “bigger electoral battle” after the assembly elections. 
 
 Earlier, Atiq and Amanmani’s names had figured in the list of candidates that   had released in December. But their names were missing from the parallel list of candidates issued by   a day later. However, the final list, sources said, includes the name of erstwhile Qaumi Ekta Dal MLA Sibghatullah Ansari, who is brother of mafia don and sitting MLA Mukhtar Ansari.
