LUCKNOW: Chief minister   has assured employees of TCS ( )’s Lucknow unit that he would speak to the top management of the IT firm and ask them not to shift operations from UP to other states. Sources in the chief minister’s camp office said a group of 15 engineers and associates from TCS met Yogi in the   at his residence on Saturday and added that he has assured them help in the matter. 

 After operating in the city for the last 33 years, TCS announced it would shift Lucknow’s IT development centre to Noida, Indore and Pune to consolidate its operations. At the same time, it maintained there will be no lay-off. But the decision didn’t go down well with around 2,000 employees of the company, who cited family reasons for not wanting to be transferred. Besides expressing their reservations on social media, they had staged a protest at the TCS office in Vibhuti Khand, Gomtinagar on Friday with placards carrying messages like ‘Save TCS Lucknow’. 
 
 Requesting not to be name, an employee said, “The management has told us verbally to wind up projects by September and shift to centres like Noida, Indore and Pune by November.” 
 
 “Aiming to create IT City and IT Park in UP, the government would be at a loss if the company that is contemplating a BPO in Varanasi leaves the state capital, so the chief minister said he will make sure the employees don’t have to shift base,” said another employee who was part of the delegation that met Yogi.
