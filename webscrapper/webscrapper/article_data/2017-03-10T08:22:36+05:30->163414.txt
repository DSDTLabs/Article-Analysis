HYDERABAD: A group of people sitting under a tent   and   on the road between   and   had been a regular sight for any resident of Domalguda, Ashok Nagar and Chikkadpally areas. However, the space, known as  , appeared deserted on Thursday as police have decided not to permit any public meetings or dharnas at 'Dharna Chowk'. 

 "For the past few days, we are not permitting any protests or dharnas at Indira Park as local people are frequently complaining about the problems they are facing due to daily protests. At the same time, in order to give space to democratic dissent, we are advising the applicants to organise protests and meetings at locations on the outskirts," Hyderabad police commissioner M Mahendar Reddy said.
 
 The recent group to stage a protest at Dharna Chowk was the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP) workers. Domalguda resident A Kiran Kumar, who works at a BPO in Gachibowli, said he was fed up of regular protests and resultant traffic problems at Dharna Chowk. "Often, protesters stage rasta rokos and police have to intervene," Kiran Kumar said.
 
 TDP MLA R Krishnaiah said not allowing protests at Dharna Chowk "is unconstitutional". "When the Union government allows protesters close to Parliament at Jantar Mantar, how can the Telangana government, which came to power through mass movement, strangle democratic dissent?," Krishnaniah told TOI.
