AHMEDABAD: More than 14 people were injured in a clash between workers of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s cattle nuisance control department (CNCD) and locals of the   area in   on Friday afternoon. 

  
 Local residents said that the police party accompanying the CNCD team lathi charged innocent people, in which some children were also injured.
 
 Local residents said a local traders’ association gave a call for an ‘Asarwa bandh’ on Saturday. Police said they have deployed adequate forces to ensure that the law and order situation is not disturbed.
 
    police registered a case under section 307 of the IPC (attempt to murder), against a group of people and have detained several persons for questioning.
 
 According to local sources, a CNCD team came to the area to catch stray cows. “Locals objected when the team and the police entered the open space in front of the temple to catch cows. The police carried out a lathi-charge, which snowballed into mobs coming on to the roads. The mobs pelted the CNCD team and police with stones,” said a local source.
 
 Senior police officials said some locals had confronted the team when they were trying to catch stray cows that were hindering traffic. “Several policemen and members of the CNCD team were injured. We have registered an offence against the mob,” a police official said.
 
 Locals said they have not approached police to lodge a complaint because they fear more police action if they do so.
