PATNA: In a shocking incident, one Vishambhar Paswan (20) killed his sister-in-law Durgavati Devi (34), her six-year-old son Amit Paswan and one-year-old daughter Ragini Kumari at village Baswar under   area in  , around 120km from here, on Saturday midnight.

 Brahmpur   Dayanand Singh said on Sunday that Vishambhar stabbed them with a heavy iron rod (khanti) several times when they were sleeping in their house. “Vishambhar knocked the door of the room in which Durgavati was sleeping with her husband Hiralal Paswan (41) and the two children. Vishambhar said he had to charge his cellphone. Soon after Hiralal opened the door and went out to relieve himself, Vishambhar locked the room from inside and attacked the woman and the children,” the SHO said. The family members soon started knocking the door, but Vishambhar did not open it. Later, they broke open the door. But, before they could understand anything, Vishambhar fled from the spot.
 
 The SHO said Hiralal told police that his younger brother wanted to marry his wife. Quoting Hiralal, he said, “Vishambhar, who worked at a factory in Bhilwara in Rajasthan, had returned a week back. Vishambhar had good relation with my wife and used to give her all the money he earned whenever he visited the village.” The SHO said, “It would be too early to jump to any conclusion but it may be a case of illicit relation between the victim and the accused.” Durgavati’s father-in-law Rajkishore Paswan (62) has lodged an FIR against his younger son.
