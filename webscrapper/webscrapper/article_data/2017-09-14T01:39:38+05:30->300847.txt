NEW DELHI:   for the 10th edition of the Airtel   (ADHM) were opened on Wednesday in the capital. This year’s marathon will be held on November 19 with a prize money of $ 275,000.

 Over 34,000 participants are expected to take part in this year’s edition and run alongside 40 international athletes from over 12 countries. Last year’s edition had seen the presence of Eliud Kipchoge — the reigning Olympic champion, sprinter Asafa Powell and Olympic medalist Patrick Sang.
 
 The ADHM this year has also received the merit of a   race — a rare distinction from the   (IAAF), classifying the   as one of the ‘leading road races around the world’.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Ravindra Singh Negi, CEO-Delhi NCR for Bharti Airtel said “Airtel began its journey in Delhi, and we are both proud and excited to motivate Delhiites to come together and run for their loved city. This year is also special for us as we complete 10 years of our association with India's most prestigious half marathon.”
 
 The registrations for the half marathon will start will remain open till October 3 and can also be done online. Registrations for the Great Delhi Run, Senior Citizens’ Run and the Champions with Disability Run will remain open till Friday, October 13.
 
 The ADHM 2017 will also see the introduction of a 10K timed run to give fillip to the emerging runner community. Participants above the age of 15 years who want to make a difference by running for charity can take part. Over 100 NGOs are expected to use the platform to raise funds and awareness for their cause. 
 
 “This edition marks a glorious legacy as we set foot into the 10th edition of the Airtel Delhi Half Marathon. ADMH has been at the forefront of change and has transcended beyond boundaries of sport, into a movement with a social conscience,” said Vivek Singh, Joint MD, Procam International.
