Eli had become her middle name after  's debut film Anuraga Karikkin Vellam hit the screens, thanks to the role that made an everlasting impression in the minds of audience. However, the actress was determined that in her next movie, she would only pick a character that has no traits of the vibrant Eli. In her next film,  , Rajisha plays an aspiring nun named Merlin and the actress says that the shooting experience was fun.

 'Merlin is born into a rich family, but wants to embrace the ascetic life of a nun. All her actions are channelled towards preparing herself for that lifestyle. That's when  's character enters her life. The rest you can watch on screen,' says Rajisha.
 Interestingly, the actress has been picking up some 'essential skills' on the sets. 'While shooting for Anuraga Karikkin Vellam, after many trials and errors, I learnt how to handle a cinematic slap. In Georgettan's Pooram, I had a scene in which I have to fall down, as I see Dileepettan's character. And what's more, it had to appear as spontaneous as possible,' she says.
 
 Rajisha began her falling spree, but the first set of attempts didn't look authentic. 'Finally, Dileepettan stepped in and showed me how to make it look authentic. So, once we were done capturing the scene from all the angles, I guess I have become an expert in it,' Rajisha laughs. 
 
 The actress has also signed Oru Cinemakkaran, in which she plays Vineeth Sreenivasan's wife. While many actresses have recently been foraying into other film industries, Rajisha says she's not keen to do films in other languages at the moment.
