AHMEDABAD: Leading   from across India debated how ‘sugar might be the new cholesterol’ for people at risk of  , as any excess amount consumed is converted to fat! Dr  , a senior cardiologist from Hinduja Hospital, said that while people are mindful of the fact that consuming high-fat food may increase   levels, there is little awareness about the adverse impact of eating excess sugar. “Sugar is still associated with diabetes but it gets directly converted to fat. There needs to be awareness about consuming   in moderation,” Kane said.

 Sugar and many other controversial factors affecting heart health and cardiac disease treatment were discussed by experts at ‘national debate’ 2017 which revived a similar exercise undertaken by leading physicians of Gujarat — Dr Harshad Gandhi, Dr Jyotindra Bhatt, and Dr Premal Thakore — in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The debate was revived by course co-ordinators, cardiologists Dr Sameer Dani, Dr Sunil Thanvi, and Dr Rashmit Pandya.
 
 Dr  , a senior cardiologist of KEM Hospital, Mumbai, said that while incidence of cardiac disease is declining in the West, it is rising in India. “This is alarming as cardiologists across India are routinely getting patients in their 40s, 30s and often even in their 20s,” Kerkar said. Dani said that comprehensive research was needed across multiple hospitals in India to determine why heart disease is assuming epidemic proportions.
 
  “Vegetables and fruits we eat, and even the air we breathe, is likely to be more polluted,” Dani said. “Moreover, Indians do not exercise. They have imported the love for junk food from the West while not imbibing their penchant for physical activity.”
 
 Thanvi said a research suggesting that cholesterol might not be the villain had gone viral recently. “Diet cholesterol forms only 30% of blood cholesterol. Moderation is the key. No research gives license to throw caution to the wind,” he said.
