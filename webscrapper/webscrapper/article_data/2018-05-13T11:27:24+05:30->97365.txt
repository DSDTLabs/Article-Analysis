KOCHI: The traffic regulations imposed by the police on   road has brought down accidents to a certain extent, shows data of past two years.

 64. The number of accidents came down to 40 and the number of deaths to one in 2017. In 2018, a total of 10 accidents happened, resulting in one death and injuries to seven people. Police said the support of local bodies and district administration helped them strictly implement the rules. Parts of containers abandoned on roadsides were also removed.
 
 “We banned parking of container trucks on right side of container road where travellers take U-turn. Container operators were asked to paste reflecting stickers on vehicles while parked. Besides, we conduct regular patrolling on the road. This has helped us to bring down accidents,” said K A  , ACP traffic east.
 
 Strict traffic guidelines were implemented after a string of incidents involving parked container trucks.
 
 But abandoned parts of containers trucks can still be found on roadsides covered with grass and bushes. A trailer was found lying upside down on roadside near   junction.
 
 Container truck drivers say the accidents occur due to careless driving of small vehicles on Container Road. “We park on Container Road where traffic movement of small vehicles is minimal compared to other roads. Parking of containers do not pose any threat to travellers or residents. The accidents can be brought down if drivers of other vehicles drive carefully. Have you ever heard container trucks ramming into each other on Container Road?” asks Shaji C V, a container truck driver.
 
 “It is easy for us to park and take it on road if we park containers on roadsides. If we park in the parking facility, it will be difficult to take the vehicle out to the road,” says Rajesh, another container driver.
