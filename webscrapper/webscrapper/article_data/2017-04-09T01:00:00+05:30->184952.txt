 believes in pulling out all stops to look every bit the character she takes on. The actress, who has gone de-glam for her role as Sanjay Dutt’s daughter in ' ', elaborates, “I’m not wearing any make-up in the film, not even mascara. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with directors and cinematographers who don’t want me to use make-up. And I have no reservations about it because that’s how I am off screen.”
While Aditi enjoys the liberating experience of going easy on the pancake on screen, she maintains that she will do whatever the role demands of her. “Sometimes you need to be made up, sometimes you need freckles, sometimes you need a mole, sometimes you need prosthetic. Being true to the character is important, otherwise it will look like any other role and that’s boring,” she concludes.
