  Similarly, on Saturday morning,   village became tense when Dalits found piles of cow dung cakes they had stored to be used as domestic fuel set on fire. Similar attempts were made Khajoori village where such piles of cow dung cakes belonging to both Dalit and Thakur families were found burnt.

  “These posters will showcase these trouble mongers in the ‘state of action’. We have developed these posters after thorough screening of the CCTV footages and newspapers clippings of the incident. We will arrest these people of the basis of these proofs,” he said.
