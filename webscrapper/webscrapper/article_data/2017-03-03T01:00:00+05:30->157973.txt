It’s only been two weeks since the   ( ) scripted history after launching 104 satellites in one go. Being the head of the organisation,  , is in the limelight now. He was in the city on Wednesday evening for the seventh convocation of   in Pallavaram. We managed to have a quick chat with him. Excerpts.

 Tell us about ISRO’s latest feat...
 By putting 104 satellites into orbit in go, we’ve demonstrated the capability of our Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. We’ve been progressively improving its ability to do different activities. Last year, we had 20 satellites launched and then we had put satellites into different orbits and now this one.
 
 And Chandrayaan-2...
 Chandrayaan-2 will have a controlled descent on to the surface of the moon. For that we’ve to develop an engine which is throttleable. The tests are in progress for that. And we are planning to have Chandrayaan-2 launch in the first quarter of 2018.
 
 Can you recollect any incident that first got you interested in space when you were a teenager? 
 When I was in school, like any other teenager, space fascinated me as well. 
 I was exposed to a 3D view master in school and that is one incident that kind of intrigued my interest in space as a teenager. And incidentally, during my career, I worked on Cartosat-1, one of the world’s best 3D stereo imaging system. 
 
 What makes you proud working for ISRO?
 ISRO makes use of the space technologies to provide solutions to various problems we have in the society. That’s the prime aim of the organisation. Starting from providing accurate information about formation of cyclones and other sudden climatic changes to warning fishermen about impending dangers while they’re are in the sea, ISRO is able to improve the lives of many people. And that’s a really motivating factor working for the organisation.
