BHOPAL: Khajuraho, famous the world over for its  , is losing its charm, thanks to the bumpy ride to the temple town that is about 369 km from Bhopal. In the last four years, the number of tourists has plummeted by a shocking 32%.

 While demonetisation did have some impact in the past couple of months —   — the real problem lies with connectivity. The downhill trend became evident in 2012 but the government did nothing even as roads crumbled and the bad word about bone-jarring rides spread. Backpackers — the backbone of   — disappeared because they travel on a shoestring budget, severely limiting their travel options to the  .
 
 There is only one train,  , connecting with Delhi and there is none from Kolkata, Mumbai or Ahmedabad, say travel agents. Few would be willing to take the back-breaking road trips from Delhi (660km), Agra (440km) Indore (560km) or even Gwalior (300km). 
 
 Balbeer Gautam, president of the guides association in Khajuraho, said, “All the roads leading to Khajuraho are in very poor condition for many years. Flights are very costly. A 45-minute flight from Varanasi to Khajuraho costs anywhere between Rs 18,000 and Rs 36,000.” There is no direct flight from Delhi or Mumbai, the two most important arrival points for foreigners.
 
 Built between 950 AD and 1050 AD by the Chandela dynasty, the temples in Chattarpur district of Madhya Pradesh have long been a must-visit for foreigners but the government never gave enough importance to ensuring that the infrastructure, too, feels welcoming. 
 
 Ashok Mehta, senior conservation assistant of ASI at Khajuraho said that the number of foreigners visiting Khajuraho dropped from 97,724 in 2012 to 65,982 in 2016. In fact, 2016 was a better year after the rock-bottom drop to 65,034 in 2015. No surprise, the tourism industry is in jeopardy. Thousands of livelihoods are on the line.
 
 “Backpackers from abroad have vanished from Khajuraho,” said Anurag Shukla, president of Dharohar guide association, pointing out that they are budget travellers who prefer road and train. “In fact, primary tourist agents in New Delhi and Jaipur have started dropping Khajuraho from their itinerary because visiting this place ‘disturbs the budget of tourists’,” Shukla said. 
 
 Mohammad Zaved, director of Khajuraho Journey, pointed out that the international tourist destination is connected with Air India flights from Varansi only thrice a week. Jet airways operates only during peak season and that too at very high rates. What’s more, domestic travellers from surrounding states also give Khajuraho a miss because of poor train connectivity, he said, adding that the less said about roads the better.
 
 “The road from Satna (100km from Khajuraho) is full of potholes for the last 10 years. This road reaches Khajuraho via Panna. The road from Jhansi (175km away) is not in good shape, either,” Zaved said. Last month, the Centre launched a project to build a road from Jhansi to Khajuraho. Will it enough to throw a lifeline?
