MYSURU: The threat posed by   virus in Kerala appears to have disrupted the itinerary of many  . Many visitors to the city, whose next stop was Kerala, are extending their sojourn in Mysuru and avoiding popular tourist destinations in the neighbouring state.

 Tourists who flock Mysuru generally head to Ooty and Kerala later. However, with more than 10 people having lost their life to the virus in Kerala, visitors have been forced to change their schedule. Consequently, hotels and resorts in the city are seeing 70 to 80% occupancy.
 
 Deputy director of the   department Janardhan confirmed to TOI that visitors to the city were prolonging their stay in the city and enjoying the many attractions it had to offer. “Many tourists have cancelled their trip to Kerala, and are staying in Mysuru. We are also trying to create awareness about Nipah virus. We have displayed a list of Dos and Don’ts at prominent tourist places including the zoo, Mysuru Palace and Chamundi Hills,” he said.
 
 President of the Hotel Owners’ Association Narayana Gowda said, “Hotels have recorded good business in the past few days with tourists are staying in Mysuru instead of going to other places.”
