Madurai: Corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar inspected the renovation works being carried out to the tune of Rs 95 lakh at the Eco Park in Madurai on Friday.

 Eco Park was started on the 5.5 acres land adjoining the main building of the Madurai Corporation, ‘Anna Maaligai’ in the year 2000, when the land was prepared and many trees were planted. It is rich in its diversity of flora, including 124 varieties of herbal trees.
 
 With over 500 varieties of trees both big and small, it is one of the greenest places in the city, providing lungs to the northern part of the city. Walkers also come in large numbers to utilise the 2.5 kms of walking track. 
 
 But, in recent times the park maintenance had gone down and even the plants were not tended to properly. 
 
 An allocation of Rs 95 lakh was made under the Atal Mission for Rejuvanation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme, under which various works have been undertaken to give this park a facelift.
 
 Iron railings are to be installed to maintain the aesthetic aspects of this park. Grass will be grown and more trees will also be planted. Musical fountains are to be renovated at a cost of Rs 9.2 lakh, while micro compositing and manure pits are to be established at a cost of Rs 3 lakh. 
 
 Corporation commissioner who inspected the works, urged the workers to expedite the pace. 
 
 Subramanian, a regular patron, said that in less than 20 years since its formation, the park had lost its greenery and also things including benches got damaged as the corporation did not maintain it properly.
 
  “If maintenance work was carried out regularly, it would save the civic body a lot of money,” he said.
