Veteran actor-filmmaker   collaborated with   on his 50th film  . He says that he never knew till the time of his death that Kashinath was unwell. Dwarakish recounts his memories of Kashinath. “It came as a shocking news this morning when I got to know Kashinath was unwell. I always recall him as a very regular and simple person, who had no ego or starry tantrums. His humility was what always appealed to me. I’ve seen him over the years in different shoots and he has always remained a down-to-earth person. He was a very good artiste and, over the years, he became his own independent army. He was a producer,  ,   and what not. He had his own style which appealed to people across different sections. We wanted Kashinath particularly for our 50th film Chowka. I’d say he has given his best performance of his career, because it was unlike what people had seen of him on the big screen before. We wanted to always cast him for this role and he agreed, to our good luck. His role was widely appreciated and he was also delighted about the same. This is very unfornunate that we’ve lost a maverick like him in our industry,” says Dwarakish.
