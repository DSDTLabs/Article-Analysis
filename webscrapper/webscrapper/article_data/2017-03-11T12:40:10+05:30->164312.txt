NEW DELHI: When BJP leader   thought of ribbing RJD chief  , he should have braced himself for the mischievous comeback.

 In the backdrop of BJP sweeping both   and   with a clear majority in the state assembly election, former deputy chief minister of   Sushil Modi launched a snide attack on Lalu, who had thrown his weight behind the SP-Congress alliance in UP.
 
 "Kya haal hai? (How are you doing now?)" Modi enquired of Lalu in a tweet on Saturday.
 
  
 
 
 The former chief minister, who is known for his dry sense of humour, quicly caught on to the meaning behind Modi's seemingly solicitous words. Then, Lalu updated Modi on his well-being and also delivered a well-aimed jibe.
 
 "I'm fine. Not letting you enter Uttar Pradesh has worked to the BJP's benefit," Lalu quipped.
 
 
 
 
 This isn't the first time Sushil Modi has laid into Lalu. At the time of the bitter feuding between  's Akhilesh and Mulayam Singh Yadav, Sushil had mocked Lalu, saying he must be scared of his sons now.
 
 It may be recalled that Sushil Modi's bid for the   came to naught, owing to alleged rival forces in the BJP who were against his nomination.
 
 On his part, Lalu is famous for his hilarious comparisons of political rivals and witty repartee. In the past, he has targeted PM Modi and compared him to Jerome K Jerome's querulous character Uncle Podger from the book 'Three Men in a Boat.'
