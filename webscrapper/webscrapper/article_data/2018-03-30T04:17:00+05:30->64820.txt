Ahmedabad: A joint team of 181 Abhayam helpline personnel, the district child marriage prevention officer and child protection officer prevented seven weddings of children at a mass wedding ceremony organized at Bakrol near Anand on Friday. Of the 18 brides and grooms, 14 were found to be below the legal age for marriage.

 According to officials, working on information received by the Abhayam helpline, teams reached the venue of the mass wedding organized by the Thakor community and asked for documents to confirm the ages of the would-be brides and grooms.
 
 “The girls were between 16 and 18 years old and the boys were in the 17-20 years age group. Community elders were called and told about that under-age marriages are illegal. The organizers and the parents of the minors involved assured us that they would hold the weddings only after the brides and grooms were of legal age,” said a team member.
 
 Officials said it is not uncommon to have more than one under-age bride or groom at such mass weddings and they remain vigilant about every such programme organized. tnn
