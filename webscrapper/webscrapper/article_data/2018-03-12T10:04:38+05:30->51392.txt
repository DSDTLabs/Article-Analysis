NEW DELHI: The Bureau of Indian Standards ( ) has received nearly a dozen complaints against manufacturers and sellers of   for using ISI   without certification and poor quality of approved headgear in the past three years.

 All the complaints relating to the misuse of the   mark were reported in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh and one of the complaints was against an online shopping portal, BIS said. 
 
 “We carry out discreet visit after receiving complaints and raids are also conducted to unearth fraudulent practices. The penalty, including fine and jail term, have been increased substantially under the new BIS Act to put greater check on fraudsters. Since ISI mark is accepted by people blindly, we have greater responsibility to ensure no one uses the mark without getting certification and those who have got the approval ensure that products comply with the norms,” a BIS official said.
 
 The official added that in most cases, complaints were lodged by genuine manufacturers who feared losing business to those who did not have ISI certification.
 
 Road safety experts and helmet manufacturers have been demanding a crackdown on manufacturing and sale of non-ISI helmets, saying that such headgear poses greater danger to two-wheeler riders.
