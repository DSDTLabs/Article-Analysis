TALWANDI SABO (BATHINDA): In the company of Thunderbolts and Yamahas, Baljinder Kaur, 31, albeit with her head covered in dupatta, looks fiery as she heads off her campaign. After all this well-built Sikh girl, has opened her second bid to be the only woman candidate in Punjab to be elected from any Takht site of Punjab ever.

 Kaur, who is an MPhil in English from Punjabi University, Patiala, is contesting from Talwandi Sabo. Previously, Shiromani Akali Dal's Harsimrat Kaur Badal from Bathinda and Ambika Soni from Anandpur Sahib had fought elections for MP. Badal, in fact, had won her parliamentary seat twice.
 
 For this young Kaur, marriage isn’t any immediate attraction. “First I will break the jathedar culture of AKali Dal and then anything else,” she tells voters.
 
 She insists that even some regular Sikh clergies at the the Takht site or neighbourhood gurdwaras, managed by Badal-backed SGPC, have begun to admit that jathedar has spoiled the reputation of men here.
 
 As she goes from one public address to another, she doesn’t hesitate to sing folk song, drawing huge applause from the locals.
 
 From Gurdas Mann’s ‘Challa’ to Manmohan Warris’ ‘Jaari Jang Rakheyo’ and Ranjit Bawa’s ‘Sher Maarna’, her favourites are high-pitch songs.
 
 “That's the way to bust the male-dominated bastions, you see,” she laughs. One of Kaur's opponents is a veteran Jeet Mohinder Sidhu of Akali Dal and other is a debutant Khushbaj Singh Jatana from the Congress.
 
 In her addresses, she focuses on facilities for sports like basketball and hockey camps for women, and anti-drug camps for the rural men folk.
 
 “Besides, since we are primarily farmers, we will increase the compensation from Rs 8,000 to Rs 20,000 and training and job employment to masters and bachelors in agriculture,” says Kaur
 
 In her neighbourhood, another 25-year-old woman candidate Rupinder Kaur, too has modelled herself on her. Rupinder is fighting from Bathinda Rural seat.
