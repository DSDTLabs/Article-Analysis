 It is believed that Shaikh told Nayak that he would receive good salary in the ‘soon-to-open’ hotel in Dubai, but will have to shell out some money as processing fees.
 
 Unsuspecting Shaikh’s motive, Nayak told his friends about the offer, who also got lured by the offer and shelled out money, collectively amounting to Rs 2.36 lakh. The victims were given fake appointment letters, immigration letters, visas and even air tickets which were downloaded from the internet with their photographs pasted on them, added the officer. 
 
 Realising something was amiss, Nayak found that the documents were fake and registered a case with the Vartak Nagar police. 
 
 “We are trying to find out who else is involved in the racket,” said the cop.
