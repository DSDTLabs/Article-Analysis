After 'Pink' and 'Baby' in Bollywood, actress Taapsee Pannu has become quite a name to reckon in the entertainment industry for the experimental kind of cinema. The actress is now hitting the screens as 'Nene Shabana', which is touted to be a prequel to 'Baby', which is released earlier to critical acclaim. 

 Directed by Shivam Nair, this action spy thriller has Akshay Kumar, Anupam Kher and Malayali actor Pruthviraj Sukumar in prominent roles. Putting up the poster of the movie's Telugu version, the petite actress wrote on her Instagram handle 'And how could I forget my Telugu gang! Here is Shabana for u in "Nene Shabana" 
  this release will be incomplete without u all!', (sic). 
 
 The movie is produced and written by Neeraj Pandey (A Wednesday and Special 26 fame) and the movie will hit the screens on March 31.
