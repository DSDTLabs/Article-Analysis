Palanpur: The state government on Tuesday issued land allotment orders to two Dalit families in Dudhkha village of Patan district. With Dalit fury raging in north Gujarat and Ahmedabad following the self-immolation of 65-year-old activist Bhanubhai Vankar, the government wasted no time in sticking to its promise. According to the demand of applicants, the land allotment order were given through Indu Vankar, the widow of Bhanubhai, in Unjha town. “Besides giving away the land allotment documents to applicants Hema Vankar and Ramji Vankar of Dudkha village, a cheque of Rs 4 lakh was handed by the social justice department to Indu Vankar,” said Anand Patel, collector of Patan district. Vankar, a former talati, had been fighting for regularizing the land of landless labourers in Dudhka and had immolated himself over the issue last week. He succumbed to burn injuries at a private hospital in Ahmedabad last Friday.
