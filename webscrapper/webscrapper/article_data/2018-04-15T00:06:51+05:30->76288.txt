NAVI MUMBAI: Peeved by the filth and unkempt condition of the   mini seashore, over 20 residents have decided to clean the pond every week starting from Sunday. 

 “The holding pond is one of the most important picnicking spots of the city. It is also an ideal spot for morning and evening walkers. Despite this the pond is in a complete mess,” said Rohit Malhotra, resident of Rohini CHS, Sector 9A.
 
 Malhotra has initiated the campaign at his own expense to prompt residents to take up the responsibility for the upkeep of city's infrastructure. He belives that once the pond is cleaned thoroughly, citizens will automatically refrain from throwing garbage. “Since the pond is already dirty, citizens think it is okay to throw more waste here. My understanding is that if the area is cleaned, then there will be some thought given before dumping garbage,” he said.
 
 The pond is in poor condition, owing to dumping of garbage and ceremonial waste. “The natural biodiversity pond, which has been developed into a recreational spot faces the biggest challenge due to the callous attitude of citizens. Shores and mangroves are clogged with filth that are essentially ceremonial waste and even tidal waves bring along waste from the creekside,” said  , urban planner and Vashi resident. 
 
 The activity is open for everyone. Those who are keen must arrive at the pond at 8am on Sunday. “We will start the process by clearing the shores of the pond. Since we have already informed the   about the activity, the civic body has planned to provide us with basic equipment required for cleaning as well as some manpower,” added Malhotra.
