Visakhapatnam: Demanding an increase in their wages, contract sanitation workers of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) staged a protest in front of HRD minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao’s residence in MVP Colony on Wednesday. 

 The protesters also demanded scrapping of GO 279 issued on December 31, 2015. They said that the GO will benefit only contractors at the cost of permanent workers.
 
 GVMC sanitation workers under AITUC and CITU also went on a strike for the second consecutive day on Wednesday after a statewide strike was called on Tuesday. Protests were staged in all the six civic zones and most of the contract and outsourcing employees from their respective zones participated in it. Apart from the 5,000 sanitary staff in Visakhapatnam, sanitary wings of Anakapalle and Bheemili also participated in the strike.
 
 The sanitation staff also plan to stage a protest on Thursday. However, GVMC officials made alternative arrangements by deploying permanent staff. Civic chief M Hari Narayanan said, “We are taking all measures to ensure that sanitation is maintained across the city. We hope that the issue will be resolved by the state government soon and outsourcing employees will return to work.”
