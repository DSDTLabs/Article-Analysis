These girls are provided with free education, food, residential accommodation and all other facilitates. The school in Amaria has 100 girls on its rolls from class VI to VIII.
  
  When TOI met them, the girls alleged that that they were forced to clean class rooms. They felt insecure at night as no woman teacher was present on the premises, though it is mandatory. The warden, they claimed, always projected 100% attendance whereas most girls went home for days. The school management did not maintain a record of such students, Sarvar said.
