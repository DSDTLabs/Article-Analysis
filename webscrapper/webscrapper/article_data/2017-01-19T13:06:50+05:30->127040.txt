KOLKATA: For those who still believe in the stereotype of the  , number-crunching  , the   Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) prepared by the NGO, Pratham, may come as a rude shock.

 Government school students in Bengal have poor mathematical skills and lag way behind their counterparts in other states when it comes to playing with numbers, the survey -released on Wednesday -has revealed. A little less than one in four (or 24%) of Bengal's Class-I students cannot even recognise the digits 1 to 9. The corresponding figures for Kerala and Arunachal Pradesh are only 10.8% and 13.1%, respectively, though Bengal fares better than the national average of 39.9%. Perhaps more worryingly , things seem to have gone downhill over time. In 2010, 45.1% of Class-III students in the state's government schools could do subtraction; in 2016, that number slid to only 35.4%. In 2010, 38.1% of government school students of Class-V could divide; in 2016, that number came down to 28.5%. The biggest slide, howe ver, comes in class-VIII.
 
 In 2010, 67.7% of these students could do division; in 2016, this dipped drastically to 32.1%. Bengal, though, can draw cold comfort from the fact that states like Kerala, Maharashtra and Karnataka, too, have shown similar trends.
 
 The gloomy scene continues in language skills as well. 17.7% of rural Bengal students (all districts except Kolkata) of class-III could not read upper-case English letters and 14.5% could read the upper case but not lower-case letters. More than one in five (or 22.6%) could read the lower case but not words or sentences, 26.6% could read words but not sentences and 18.7% could read simple sen tences.
 
 Another worrying trend is the increasing dependence on private tuition. The percentage of Bengal's government school students of classes VI to VIII going for private tuition has increased from 76.2 in 2014 to 77.6 in 2016. The trend is repeated in other classes as well: 58.4% students of classes I to V took private tuition in 2014; it rose to 60.3% in 2016.This contrasts with the trend in Gujarat and Arunachal Pradesh, where the percentage of students going for private tuition has actually come down.
 
 State Syllabus Committee chairman Avik Mazumdar said: “A structural change is required if one goes by the report. Students should be given some more time to adjust to the new syllabus and curriculum, which are now in place.“
