AHMEDABAD: There is a growing chorus to introduce the teaching of English as a subject from class I in primary schools across the state.

 Educationists say that this demand is rising as even parents from the lower middle class now aspire having their children study in English medium schools.
 
 The aspiration to enrol wards in English medium schools is apparent from the fact that every year, an average of 50 Gujarati medium schools are forced to shut down in the state even as 300 new English medium primary schools start operations. 
 
 In the ‘Chintan Shibir’ held in Gandhinagar last week to deliberate improvement of the quality education, the introduction of English from class I was one of the primary recommendations.
 
 “Many educationists batted for the early introduction of English to primary students even in villages, as it would remove the disadvantage they face later for delayed exposure to the language. Not just educationists, even ordinary parents in rural areas insist on their children being exposed to English early on, to brighten their chances at academics and in life in general,” said  , former director of primary education.
 
 Sources say the   government early in 2002 had decided to introduce English in class I and even got textbooks printed, but the decision was reversed following protests by right-wing organizations.
 
 Director of  ,   (GCERT) M I Joshi said that children are presently introduced to English in class III. Officials said if English is introduced earlier, it will earn the faith of parents and help retain their wards in government schools, as they admit them to private schools mainly for the English advantage.
