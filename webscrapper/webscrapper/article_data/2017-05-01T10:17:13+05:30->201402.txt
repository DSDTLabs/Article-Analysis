COIMBATORE: Strewing vegetables on the Erode-Sathyamangalam highway, about 100 vegetable hawkers from   traffic and protested on Sunday against the   department officials who asked them to remove shops set up along the road. 

 Officials of the national   of India (NHAI) had visited the roadside   near   on the highway around 7.15am. Erode police rushed to the spot after 30 minutes and removed the protesters from the road.
 
 "The NHAI officials intervened after receiving a complaint stating that the vegetable market was a hindrance for smooth flow of traffic on the national highway. The vegetable hawkers have been doing business along the stretch since last two years. They have been doing brisk business from six months, particularly on Sundays, thanks to nearby residential colonies," a police officer said.
 
 Police officers blamed the national highways department for not taking action against the hawkers earlier. "NHAI should have acted earlier to avoid such a situation. As the hawkers have been selling vegetables at the place regularly, asking them to evict from the place at short notice is not fair," an officer told TOI. 
 
 Senior police officers, who held talks with the hawkers, allowed them to continue the sale for the day. "We have asked them to meet the district collector on Monday to find a solution," an officer said.
