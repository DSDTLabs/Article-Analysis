NEW DELHI: Countering the opposition’s allegation that the Centre’s   ( ) formula would fail to ease the burden of the farmer, the PM   on Saturday said many people were “spreading confusion and creating atmosphere of despair” regarding the government’s decision and assured farmers that all major costs incurred would be taken into account to fix the support price as promised in the budget.

 
 “It’s (government’s decision to fix MSP at minimum one-and-a-half-times the  ) is an important step related to income of hard-working farmers. We have been working with the state governments so that farmers can be benefited from it”, said Modi while addressing gathering of farmers and agriculture scientists. 
 
 He said the cost of production would include elements such as  , expenses on farmers’ own or rented machinery as well as livestock, cost of seeds and fertilisers, expenses on irrigation, revenue being given to state government, interest on working capital and rent of leased land among others.
 
 “It will also include labour put by farmers and their family members,” Modi said, referring to what is called A2+FL (actual paid out cost plus imputed value of unpaid family labour) formula of calculating cost of production.
