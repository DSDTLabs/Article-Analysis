MUMBAI: The highest-ever voter turnout for Tuesday's   election was in Bhandup, with the average turnout being 64.76% compared to 46.96% in 2012. And it seems to have had an impact on the results: the sitting MNS suffered amajor setback, the   regained lost ground and the   made inroads.

 The BJP winning two constituencies in Bhandup surprised many. “Bhandup is known for its slum population. But in the past five years, there has been a real estate boom,“ said  , who has been staying in Bhandup for over three decades. “Middle class and upper middle class voters have increased. Also, a good number of Gujaratis and Jains have settled here in recent years,“ he added.
 
 The BJP had campaigned aggressively, appealing to those in the highrises to come out and vote. This, coupled with intensive social media campaigning, pushed up the turnout in two wards (111and 112) close to Bhandup station area, and BJP won them with comfortable margins.
 
 The Sena had worked hard to regain goodwill over the past few years in several slum pockets by providing civic amenities like toilets and health facilities, good drainage system, drinking water pipelines, buildingrepairing internal roads. “Sena ruled the corporation and it expedited the sanction of funds for repairs and development in the Bhandup slums,“ said local activist  . “The MNS influence dwindled over time as the Sena went door to door helping the locals,“ he said.
 
 Sources said the slum population of Bhandup had also increased in the past few years, with many migrants settling there. This seems to have favoured the  , which won one seat in Bhandup.
