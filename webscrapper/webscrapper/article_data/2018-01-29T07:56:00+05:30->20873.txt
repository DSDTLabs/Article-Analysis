GURUGRAM: The concentration of   rose by about 20% on Sunday over Saturday, as   continued to engulf the city. While the highest level of PM2.5 on Sunday stood at 167.98 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³), it was 127 µg/m³ on Saturday, when it had shot up by 52% over Friday, after a week when PM2.5 concentration had continuously hovered below 100 µg/m³.

 According to the Met department, the situation will persist on Monday, but is expected to improve by Tuesday. “We are expecting western disturbances in the next two days. The temperature might increase, which is expected to cause a slight fall in the concentration of particulate matter in the lower atmosphere,” said a Met department official.
 
 Meanwhile, officials at Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) again blamed high levels of moisture in the air for the rise in concentration of particulate matter. 
 
 “Weather conditions such as fog and fall in wind speed are responsible for the rise in concentration of particulate matter. Particulate matter sticks to water droplets in the air due to presence of fog, and because low wind speed doesn’t disperse the particulate matter,” said a HSPCB official.
 
  He assured that all anti-pollution measures corresponding to the graded response action plan ( ) for the ‘poor’ category, have been taken. 
 
 But residents blamed authorities for not taking adequate measures to combat air pollution.
 
  “We don’t see any measure authorities claim to have taken. Roads were sprinkled, but only during November and December, when pollution levels were extremely high. Burning and dumping of waste in the open, at unauthorised locations, goes on unnoticed everywhere in the city. We’ve filed several complaints with MCG against waste burning, but no action has been taken,” said Siddharth Gupta, a Sector 51 resident.
 
 The average maximum and minimum temperatures on Sunday were 21°C and 7°C respectively, both a notch below Saturday’s averages.
