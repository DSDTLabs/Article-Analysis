BALARAMPUR: Police have sought call detail records (CDR) from the service providers of two SIM cards found in the mobile phone of Trilochan Mahato, the 20-year-old BJP Yuva Morcha member found murdered on Wednesday.

 The mobile was found near the third-year college student’s body recovered from a forest barely a kilometre from his home in Supurdi village of Balarampur,  .
 
 Police have also asked for the tower locations of the SIM cards to ascertain the movements of the youth. They have further sought the tower dump of the spot where the body was found and its vicinity to trace other mobile users nearby. A tower dump comprises incoming and outgoing calls related to a particular tower within its operational radius. 
 
 No arrest has been made so far but a four-member probe team has been set up. A   officer said: “We will wait for the CDR as these will help take our investigation forward.” 
 
 Trilochan’s father, Hariram Mahato, had named six Trinamool activists, including Balarampur panchayat samity karmadakhya Nabakishore Mahato, in his complaint to the local police station on Wednesday. A senior officer said: “We will question the six. We will also speak to the victim’s college friends and neighbours. We will further probe if he had an affair.”
 
 A BJP team, led by national secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and Mukul Roy, approached   on Thursday. The team apprised it of the violence unleashed during the panchayat poll and after across West  , and submitted a list of party workers who were victims. “The commission has noted our allegations,” Roy said. 
 
 “Trilochan Mahato was involved with the party since 2013 and was a secretary of the mandal yuva morcha,” said Subrata Chatterjee, general secretary (organisation) of Bengal BJP. “His parents are not in a state to talk to us.” On Thursday, Roy conveyed his condolence to Trilochan’s brother Shibnath.
 
 During the day, shops and buses were inaccessible during the 12-hour Balarampur bandh called by BJP
