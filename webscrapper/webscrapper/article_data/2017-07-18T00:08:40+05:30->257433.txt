Trichy: Issues over sand quarry took another twist as   owners are now demanding a sand quarry be allotted to them in the Cauvery River. Lamenting about their inability to repay crop loans owing to drought for the last two years, they requested the district collector to permit them to take sand from southern bank of Cauvery, here on Monday. 

 Farmers from Vengur, Natarajapuram, Koothaippaar, Arasankudi, Thiruverumbur, Mullaikudi and Puthavaram villages in Thiruverumbur taluk in the district appealed the district administration to save them from adversities which were caused by the drought. 
 
 “Like other areas in delta districts, the villages in Thiruverumbur also have to bear the brunt of severe drought. Agriculture, the livelihood of these people, failed here. Several of them bought bullock carts by taking loan from cooperative societies. The drought prevented them from replaying the loan and also even running their family,” said Siva Suriyan, district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam Ayilai, before submitting the petition to the collector at the district collector office on Monday. 
 
 The villagers said that they had an idea of running the show by taking sand from Cauvery with the permission from the government. But, they alleged, the police prevented them from taking sand. Hence, they decided to knock at the doors of the district administration to obtain special permission. 
 
 “Around 500 families with 200 bullock carts are left in the lurch without any business for survival. Our repeated appeals to the PWD officials concerned for   has been in vain. They were not bothered about the livelihood of the people. Hence, we appeal the district collector to allow them to take sand on the southern bank of Cauvery in Vengur area,” said M Subramainan, district president of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam. 
 
 They were also specific that the place should be reserved for only for bullock carts.
