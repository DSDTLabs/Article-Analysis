NEW  : Lieutenant governor   on Saturday said that he had not received the file related to the draft notification of the   from the social welfare department. 

 A statement from the lieutenant governor’s office said: “The Social Welfare Department has confirmed that the file is still under process in the department and has not been submitted to the   Secretariat.”
 
 On Friday, social welfare minister Rajender Pal Gautam had said that Delhi Government could not notify the   directly as the Act had not elaborated on the definition of ‘state’. 
 
 The file would therefore have to be referred to the lieutenant governor and through him to the ministry of home affairs which would in turn authorise the lieutenant governor to take suitable action.
