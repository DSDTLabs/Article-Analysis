 MUMBAI: A 400m-long mangrove stretch has been encroached upon, as debris, dumped by miscreants, has been disposed right inside the marine green cover by the civic contractor who is building a nodal road behind the residential area in sector 50E, located between the   ( ) headquarters and   station in Nerul. 

 When TOI approached the mangrove cell, a round officer was sent to take stock of the situation. “This part of the mangrove area has not been included in the notified forest. We have not come across any such complaints. However, we have instructed our round officer to check,” said range forest officer  .. After conducting an inspection of the area P R Gaikwad, round officer of forest department said, “The contractor has brutally killed the mangroves by shifting the debris. I will draft and submit a detailed report to our seniors for action against the contractor and NMMC as well.” 
 
 Environmentalists and activists are peeved over the destruction of the green cover and the lack of by surveillance by the civic officials as well as the local mangrove cell. Environmentalist and head of   and Navi Mumbai Existence, Sukumar Killedar, said, “This is yet another example of butchering of mangroves in the city.”
 
  A safety wall built at the creek side while constructing the internal road. But the already dumped debris was shifted further inside the creek. NMMC is oblivious to the activities of its contractor who used bulldozers to shift the debris into the mangrove area, alleged locals. “There was no supervisor from NMMC to monitor the work. We remained a mere spectator when the mangroves were destroyed. The culprit should be penalised,” said a resident, Amey More. Deputy commissioner of Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (Zone-I), Dadasaheb Chabukswar said, “I have no idea about such development. I will send concerned engineers to see whether such an attempt was made to destroy mangroves by the said civic contractor.”
