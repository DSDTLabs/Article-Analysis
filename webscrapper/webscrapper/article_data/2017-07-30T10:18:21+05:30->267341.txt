Singer Pushpavathy, who has many out-of-the-box songs to her credit, mostly composer by  , teams up with the music director yet again for a unique song.

  
  
 
 In the upcoming movie 'Thrissivaperoor Kliptham,' she has sung a fun song that goes 'Thrissooru Muzhuvanum Roundaanu,' a track that would be a perfect tribute to Kerala's cultural capital. The song progresses painting musical imageries of all things Thrissur, through it's lovable dialect and peculiar words like gadyanu, davanu and the like.
 
 The song is penned by P S Rafeeque and the movie is directed by Ratheish Kumar.
