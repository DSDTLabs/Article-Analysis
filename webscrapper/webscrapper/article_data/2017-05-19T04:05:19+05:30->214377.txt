NEW DELHI:   welcomed the   order on Thursday and said it vindicated the   government’s decision to take Pakistan to the UN court. Stating that it marked a big relief to Jadhav’s family and the nation as a whole, party chief   praised Centre for “quick and effective measures on the matter”. 

 “India, under the decisive leadership of PM Modi, stands firmly for the safety of each and every citizen of our country,” Shah tweeted later in the day while praising lawyer Harish Salve who argued India’s case at the ICJ.
 
 The court’s decision came on a day when the party and the government were grieving because of the suddening death of environment minister Anil Dave. However, the ICJ decision, which came just after a meeting of the Cabinet convened specifically to condole Dave’s death, lifted spirits, with praise flowing for the PM for taking the unprecedented decision to approach the ICJ to thwart Pakistan from executing an Indian citizen.
 
 The decision, a first, had raised eyebrows because many felt it might not achieve much and carried the risk of derailing India’s consistent stand that India-Pakistan disputes should be sorted out bilaterally.
 
 Congress had publicly expressed reservations, raising the government’s stakes in a successful outcome.
 
 However, those in the government believe going to ICJ has certainly staved off the risk of   meeting the same fate as Sarabjeet Singh. Held guilty of espionage and terror, he was on death row when he was killed by jail inmates in puzzling circumstances.
 
 BJP leaders refrained from publicly criticising Congress for what one of them called “propensity to rush to judgments for partisan ends”, but emphasised that the success at the Hague had again underscored the Modi government’s readiness to explore “out-of-the-box” solutions as well as the rewards that such risk-taking could fetch.
