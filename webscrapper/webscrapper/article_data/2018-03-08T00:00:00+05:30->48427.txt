Actress   has been choosing her roles with great care. And her next film   goes on to prove just that. 
An experimental film in the true sense, Sindhu points out, "The run time of this film and the run time of the story it is unravelling, is the same - two and a half hours. For this, we have also shot all our scenes over 15 days in just those two and a half hours in the morning. We shot everyday between 6 am and 8.30 am."
 The biggest challenge for Sindhu, who plays the central character here, was the fact that there were no cuts during the scenes. "There is a lot of preparation that goes into being able to achieve something like this. What you see on screen is a story about this one girl who wants to chase her dreams. And this particular day, the two and a half morning hours is possibly her last chance to be able to reach her goals. So for me to enact this character, I not only need to know my dialogues thoroughly, I also need to know the dialogues of the other people I am sharing screen space with so that I am ready with my counter dialogue, with expressions et al. Most of the shots are close ups, so there is no way you cannot be perfect with what you are trying to say."
 While the team shot for 15 days, Sindhu tells us, "We shot only in the morning, but the rest of the day was filled with intense rehearsals. We spent the entire day preparing for the next day's shoot so that we are able to deliver these scenes in just that one single take. And it feels great to have been part of something that was so challenging," says Sindhu. 
 The film is expected to release shortly.
