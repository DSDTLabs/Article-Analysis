THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A   has filed a   in the  , demanding a   monitored by the court into the alleged lapses on the part of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Union governments in dealing with   and its aftermath.

 The petition filed by Fr Laberin Yesudhas of St Pius X Church Kumarapuram has arraigned National Disaster Management Authority, National Disaster Response Force and India Meteorological Department as co-accused. 
 
 The petitioner, whose relatives are also in the list of missing fishermen, is secretary of Latin Catholic Fishermen Educational Society.
 
 “As per government records, the total number of missing persons when   cyclone lashed the southern coasts is 462, whereas Fr Vicar Forane of Thoothoor vicariate states that the total number of missing fishermen from Thoothoor area alone is 376,” the petitioner pointed out. It also alleged that the government of Kerala had no clarity on the total number of missing fishermen. Latin Archdiocese of Trivandrum (Kerala), on the basis of statistics by Trivandrum Social Service Society, claimed that the total number was 241, which the state government neither approves nor rebuts, the petition said.
 
 Fr Yesudhas alleged lack of preparedness by the authorities for the large number of causalities. “The early warning system failed or authorities ignored the information and failed to give warning to the fishermen. The lapses need to be investigated preferably under the supervision of this court and responsibilities have to be fixed,” he said.
 
 The controversy over the bid to divert disaster management fund for paying rent of helicopter chartered by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan was also mentioned by the petitioner. “The helicopter was chartered for the chief minister, WHO was at a party meeting in Thirssur, to meet the central team that arrived to assess the damages caused by Ockhi. When it triggered a row, the order was cancelled,” he alleged.
