BHOPAL: A 33-year-old man — relative of Vyapam-accused former minister Laxmikant Sharma — was found hanging from a ceiling fan in the bungalow of ex-MLA Girja Shanker Sharma in the posh   on Tuesday. No suicide note was found.

 Police identified the victim as   Dubey, a resident of Sironj town in  . He deleted all his call details, mobile data and some Facebook posts before committing suicide, said a police source.
 
 Dubey lived in the same locality as Laxmikant in Sironj. In Bhopal, Dubey lived in the bungalow of Girja Shanker, which is next to Laxmikant’s. Police say Dubey came to   nine years ago and did a journalism course here. He worked as an ad hoc teacher at a journalism institute in Bhopal but quit around the time the Vyapam scam was exposed. He was working for a Doordarshan show of late, say sources.
 
 He was a calm and composed man but seemed to be depressed because he didn’t have a proper job, say police. On Tuesday, he had lunch with a friend around 2.30pm after which the friend left. Around 5pm, his servant   went to call him for tea but Dubey didn’t open the door. Kurmi thought he was sleeping. He went back at 7.30pm and was worried when he still got no answer. He called neighbours and peeped inside to find him hanging. 
 
 “The reason for his suicide is unknown. The body was sent for post-mortem,”   SP Siddharth Bahuguna said. Senior FSL scientist Dinesh Sharma, who examined the scene, said it was a clear case of suicide. Vibhor’s bed was full of medicines and some were even kept under the table, he said.
