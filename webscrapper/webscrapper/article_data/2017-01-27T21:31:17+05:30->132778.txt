KOZHIKODE: The   ( ) has reinstated the recognition of the   to offer open and distance learning (ODL) programmes.

 The apex higher education regulator on Friday granted recognition to the varsity to offer 26 courses under the School of Distance Education (SDE) for the academic year 2017- 18 and 2018- 19.
 
 The UGC had, in September 2015, withdrawn the recognition of the ODL courses offered by the varsity for the academic year 2015-16 citing varsityâ€™s failure to comply with the UGC guidelines. The apex higher education regulator had taken strong exception to the varsity operating off- campus counselling centres outside its territorial jurisdiction, including in the Gulf.
 
 A four member UGC delegation had conducted an inspection visit of the varsity earlier this month to assess the facilities of SDE. During the inspection, the varsity was made to submit an undertaking that it would comply with the UGC directives governing the conduct of ODL programmes.
 
 The varsity had shut down over 200 counselling and programme centres and had converted the registration of tens of thousands of students of school of distance education (SDE) to private registration to comply with the UGC order. As many as 1.8 lakh students were enrolled under the SDE when the UGC cancelled its recognition in 2015.
 
 "It is definitely a great relief for the varsity and we will start fresh admissions from the next academic year. However the two current batches we had admitted under the private registration mode will continue in that mode," SDE director, Dr. V M Kannan said.
