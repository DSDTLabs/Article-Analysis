PATNA: A day after the Patna traffic police and the Bihar State   flagged off the road safety weak with an aim to create awareness about traffic rules, hundreds of   workers were seen riding bikes without helmets on city roads to welcome the party’s national president  .

 “At least 50 BJP supporters stopped near the Income tax roundabout and began bursting crackers. This led to a lot of chaos and traffic movement was disrupted,” a passer-by, who was on his way to the Patna airport, told TOI.
 
 Almost a week ago, RJD workers going to receive health minister Tej Pratap Yadav at the airport also overlooked traffic rules and were criticised by BJP functionary Mangal Pandey for their carelessness. Carrying party flags in hands, they rode bikes without helmets and left their vehicles inside a ‘no-parking zone’.
 
 Taking a dig at the BJP workers after Tuesday’s incident, RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said, “The saffron party does not adhere to any rules. Its supporters were riding bikes without the mandatory helmets and bursting crackers on a busy road. This shows their true colours.”
 
 State   chief and education minister Ashok Kumar Choudhary also criticised the BJP workers and said senior leaders should not allow the supporters to violate rules as they set a poor example to everyone.
