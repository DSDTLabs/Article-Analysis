NEW DELHI: The Delhi unit of BJP on Friday accused city health minister   of “financial irregularities“ in land deals and demanded chief minister   sack him and respond to the charges.

 The party accused Jain of indulging in “dubious land deals“ by resorting to “irregular means“, the char ges the minister refuted and sug gested they are part of a political conspiracy.
 
 “People today want a firm statement from the CM on the allegations on Jain, including of dubious land deals,“ Delhi BJP chief   said.
 
 Responding to the allegations, Jain accused the I-T department of “selectively leaking“ information on him.
 
 “I am working on   elections where I am a star campaigner. Things like this will give boost to my face value. It's an exercise for Punjab elections.We are not scared,“ Jain said when asked about an I-T notice to him last year.
 
 The I-T department had in September issued summons to Jain asking him to appear before it in connection with a tax evasion probe against certain Kolkata-based firms.
 
 Officials had said the department had recovered documents relating to some transactions made by at least three firms and that they had links to Jain. Jain, however, said he had gone to the I-T department as witness in October, reiterating he is no longer associated with the three companies. He said he had declared his income in 2013 and 2015 to the Election Commission.
