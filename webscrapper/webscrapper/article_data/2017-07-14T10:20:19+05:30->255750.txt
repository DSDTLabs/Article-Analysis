Recently, we had spoken to director   on the 25th anniversary of Annamalai. While discussing the film, we couldn't stop asking the director, who has worked with both   and  , about how different the two icons are when it comes to their approach towards acting.

 Talking about Kamal, whom he has been working with since his days assisting K Balachander, Suresh Krissna says, “He is a very methodical performer. He has to internalise the whole shot, rehearse, ensure his co-actors (even the junior artistes) are doing it right before shooting it. He appreciates if someone does things differently and asks the director to use that in the shot. He also sees to it that the shot is set up properly . For him, the whole ambience has to be perfect. He knows each and every department and wants to get involved to ensure that every frame is perfect. This is why he does not hesitate to rehearse 10 to 15 times; similarly, he doesn't mind if he has to do 20 takes. That is why there is an allround perfection in his scenes. Being a writer and director himself, his love for cinema makes him approach a shot this way .“
 
 But,  , he says, is the exact opposite. “Rajini sir blindly trusts the director. He will rehearse to get the timing right with his co-stars, but once it's done, that's it. And he needs to get the spark on the spot.He will do some unexpected things during the shot, which will add spontaneity to his performance. He thinks only about what his audience will want in that instant in a particular scene. If it has a mass ele ment and works, he will leave the rest to the director. He will say, `Unagalukku OK-na OK.' He will not worry over the framing or the movement of the camera because he doesn't see that as his job on the set,“ says reveals.
