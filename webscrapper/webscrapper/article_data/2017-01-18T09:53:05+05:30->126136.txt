 Though she didn't name Sasikala, she said: "I cannot accept anyone apart from   and Puratchi Thalaivi Amma...I don't see anyone (else) in her (Jayalalithaa's) place." Deepa denied she had any personal issues with Sasikala. "My views are based on only what people want," she said.
 
 Explaining her next move, Deepa said: "There are two options - one to join the AIADMK and the other, to launch a new party. I will decide on it after speaking to my supporters." She said would announce her decision on Jayalalithaa's birth anniversary, which falls on February 24.
