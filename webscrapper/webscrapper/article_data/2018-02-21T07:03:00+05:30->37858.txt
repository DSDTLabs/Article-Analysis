Ludhiana: Issuing a strict warning to Congress workers indulging in anti-party activities by working against the party’s official candidates, District Congress president Gurpreet Gogi has said such workers will be permanently expelled from the party. The development comes in the wake of recent complaints lodged by some Congress candidates with Gogi, about workers of some wards conspiring against them.

 Speaking to TOI, Gogi said: “Congress is a very disciplined party, and everyone — regardless of his rank or designation — has to abide by the rules and regulations of the party, and the decisions of the high command should be acceptable to all. For Ludhiana MC elections, the party has allotted tickets to 95 candidates, and it is now everyone’s duty to ensure these candidates emerge winners with a huge margin, and we have a Congress mayor of Ludhiana city, which is the dream of our chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Sunil Jakhar.”
 
 Gogi added: “It has come to my notice that in some wards, our own workers are indulging in anti-party activities, and also working against our official candidates, which is a serious breach of trust and discipline. So, such people need to be dealt with seriously, and anyone is found guilty of doing such acts will be stripped off all his/her designations, and expelled from the party permanently.”
