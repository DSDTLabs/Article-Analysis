Trichy: Terming the Supreme Court’s directive to the Karnataka government to release 4 TMC of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu as too little and too late, farmers in the Cauvery delta region of Tamil Nadu on Thursday said they are losing their faith in the judiciary. They said they had already lost their faith in the central and state governments. The farmers associations alleged that the Centre was intentionally delaying its duty to come out with a scheme for water sharing, as directed by the Supreme Court earlier. The associations said they are planning to hold a massive protest after May 8 targeting central government establishments to convey their displeasure. State president of the farmers wing of the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) Puliyur A Nagarajan said, “The BJP government that is eyeing the Karnataka assembly election has been intentionally postponing its responsibility to frame a scheme that enables Tamil Nadu to get its share of the Cauvery water. It seems the Supreme Court prefers to remain a mute spectator in watching the central government’s indifferent attitude towards the lower riparian state.” “The AIADMK-led Tamil Nadu government has failed to protect the interest of the farming community…. With uncertainty continuing, kuruvai and samba cultivation is in jeopardy. Potable water supply in at least 13 districts is also in jeopardy,” said M P Chinnadurai, district president of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam.
