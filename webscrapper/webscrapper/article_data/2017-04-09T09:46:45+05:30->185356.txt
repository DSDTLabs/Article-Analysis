GUWAHATI: BJP and Congress are locked in a tough   as the   constituency goes to the bypoll on Saturday. 

 Altogether, 2,19,751 people will decide whether BJP will retain the Dhemaji (ST) constituency seat or the opposition Congress grabs power after suffering a series of electoral debacles since the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.
 
 The Dhemaji seat, located on the northern part of the state, fell vacant after incumbent BJP legislator Pradan Baruah won from the Lakhimpur parliamentary seat last year. BJP led a pitched campaign in the run up to the bypoll to retain the seat. Voting will be held in 273 polling stations. Counting will take place on April 13.
 
 BJP's Ranoj Pegu, Congress's Babul Sonowal, CPM's Jadu Hazarika, Hem Kanta Miri and Independent Rajkumar Doley are in the fray. But the ground report says the main fight will be between BJP and Congress.
 
 Chief minister   and health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma took part in more than 10 election rallies in Dhemaji, highlighting the achievements of the state government. They also promised a slew of development projects and accused Congress of misrule when it was in power.
 
 Congress has claimed that voters in Dhemaji are turning away from the ruling party. The party alleged that the BJP-led government in Dispur was unable to deliver good governance in the last 10 months. Congress state president  , Congress Legislature Party leader Debabrata Saikia, former Union minister Paban Singh Ghatowar and former state Congress minister   had campaigned for the bypoll. 
 
 Assam governor Banwarilal Purohit had earlier declared a local holiday in Dhemaji district on Sunday in connection with the byelection.
