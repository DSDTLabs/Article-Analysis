PUNE: The metro corporation, along with the   (PMPML), will carry out a route rationalisation of   across the city. Buses, which are working on the metro route now as "main service", will be converted to "feeder services." 

 The Union cabinet on December 7 approved the first phase of the   rail project covering a distance of 31.254km over two corridors - Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation to Swargate covering 16.6km and Vanaz to Ramwadi covering 14.7km. 
 
 The project will be implemented by the   (Maha Metro), which will be a 50:50 jointly owned company of the Central and Maharashtra governments.
 
 "The PMPML is currently operating bus services parallel to the metro route. We would like to make some changes in this bus system. The buses should change their routes and provide connectivity towards the metro route," said Brijesh Dixit, managing director of Maha Metro.
 
 As per PMPML officials, the route changes will have an impact on areas like Karve Road, Paud Road, FC Road, J M Road, Satara Road and the Peth areas.
 
 The Metro project, to be built at a cost of Rs 11,420 crore, will benefit around 50 lakh people in the Pune metropolitan area. The project is expected to be completed in five years.
