PATNA: The Patna bench of   (CAT) on Friday issued show-cause notices to state chief secretary   and home department principal secretary Amir Subhani, asking them to explain why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them for not complying with a previous order of the tribunal.

 The CAT had quashed departmental proceedings against former IPS officer   on July 20 this year and asked the authorities concerned to provide him retiral benefits. However, Ahmad is yet to get superannuation benefits. Union home secretary Rajiv Mehrishi and   ( ) chairman David R Syiemlieh have also been served show-cause notices by the tribunal on the same issue. The order was issued by tribunal’s bench of judicial member Jayesh V Bhairavia and administrative member A K Upadhyay.
 
 The officer had retired on November 30 last year. The departmental proceeding was initiated against him on a complaint that he had encroached some part of a road at Sangam Vihar in Digha. Later, the officer was suspended on April 21, 2016 on charges of indiscipline and insubordination.
 
 “Even after quashing of departmental proceeding against the retired IPS officer, the government is yet to provide him retiral benefits,” Ahmad’s counsel Jayant Kumar Karn said, adding Ahmad was not promoted to DIG rank due to the departmental proceeding against him.
