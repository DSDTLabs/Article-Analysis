Mapusa: Mapusa municipality late Monday evening demolished the dilapidated structure of beef and pork stalls which were declared unsafe. Beef and pork stall owners from the Mapusa market were shifted to mutton stalls in the same building as a temporary measure after the structure was declared unsafe.  Beef and pork stalls were in a dangerous position after the foundation of the building was exposed because of the ongoing work of the nullah by the WRD. The demolition was carried out using machinery in the presence of Mapusa municipality chairperson Rohan Kavlekar, chief officer Clen Madeira, administrative officer Bhanudas Naik, municipal engineer Hussain Shah Mujzar, municipal engineer Venkatesh Sawant and other municipal staff. The area was vacated by municipal staff under the supervision of municipal engineer Tayo Gadekar before the demolition. Kavlekar said that the building was in a dangerous condition and with the monsoon fast-approaching, the danger of the collapse was imminent. He said that the matter was put before the council last Friday and it was resolved to demolish the structure.
