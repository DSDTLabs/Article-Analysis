MARGAO: Former Nuvem MLA Francisco Xavier   on Saturday demanded that the vigilance department conduct a thorough investigation into assets of senior police officials. He alleged they receive haftas (bribes) as their share in all illegal activities, especially matka activities occurring across the state.

 Pacheco said he has photographic evidence of illegal godgoddo gambling taking place within the government premises at Margao’s Old Market, with some matka bookies openly taking bets within 500 metres of the   district police headquarters.
 
 Denying Pacheco’s ‘wild allegations’, SP South   said the police conducted regular raids on those involved in gambling activities.
