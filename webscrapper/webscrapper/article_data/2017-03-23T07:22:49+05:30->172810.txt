CHENNAI: The   government on Wednesday appointed retired Madras high court judge Justice   as chairman of the Private Schools Fee Determination Committee. 

 "The term of the office of chairman is for a period of three years from the date of nomination," said an official statement. The appointment comes after a lapse of 15 months since the tenure of last chairman   ended.
 
 The state government enacted the TN Schools (Regulation of Collection of Fee) Act in 2009, under which a committee led by a retired high court judge is constituted for the purpose of determination of the fee for admission to any standard or course of study in private schools.
 
 The committee has the powers to determine the fee to be collected by private schools and hear complaints with regard to collection of fee in excess of the fee determined by it or fixed by the government, as the case may be.
