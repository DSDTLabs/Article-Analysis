BHUBANESWAR: With less than a year to go for the forthcoming general and assembly elections due in 2019, BJD president and chief minister   on Sunday said his party is seriously considering finalising the names of candidates for the polls scheduled to be held simultaneously. 

 While responding to a media query on the party's strategy in the wake of   announcing to finalise its candidates early,   said, "We will look seriously into the matter and make a decision within the party soon." He was talking to reporters at his residence here on his return from a six-day tour of New Delhi. 
 
 The chief minister's statement assumes significance amid his recent review of the party's organizational strength in the districts. Speculation is rife that the party is looking for fresh candidates in many constituencies where the sitting parliamentarians and legislators are facing anti-incumbency. Though the win-ability will be the biggest factor in finalising the names of candidates, issues like multiple aspirants from a single constituency, infighting, allegations against the sitting MLAs and age are will be kept in mind while retaining or removing existing legislators. 
 
 "The party has its own way of candidate selection. It will take the right decision at the right time," said a senior BJD leader requesting anonymity.
 
 Political analysts believe election management will be the biggest challenge for the ruling party despite a huge support base. "Unlike previous elections, there are at least three to four aspirants in every constituency with almost similar clout. If the party were to finalise one of them, the remaining aspirants may play spoilsport. Hopefully, the party has been looking into the matter," said an election analyst.
