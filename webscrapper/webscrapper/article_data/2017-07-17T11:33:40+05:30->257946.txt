VISAKHAPATNAM: The district unit of YSRC, which has been demanding a CBI inquiry into the alleged land scam in Visakhapatnam area, has decided to stay away from representing their views and voices before the   (SIT).
 
 Even though the deadline for the general public to approach the SIT ended on July 15 itself, political parties can make their representations and submit evidence till July 20. The state government had in June constituted the three-member SIT, headed by Vineet Brijlal (DIG-Greyhounds), to probe the land scam after it caused a furore in the political circles and put the ruling party in the dock.
 
 The alleged scam has provided a shot in the arm of main Opposition YSRC to continue their scathing attack on the ruling TDP. From party Supremo YS   staging a mega protest in Vizag on June 22 to all-party leaders visiting the lands in question on June 13, the scam constantly hit headlines ever since it surfaced a few months ago.
 
 Alleging that the SIT inquiry has been orchestrated by the state government to just divert the attention of the general public, the YSRC has been demanding a CBI probe into the scam. Now, the party has taken a stand to skip the SIT inquiry. However, the party has been instrumental in motivating the victims, following which the SIT was flooded with complaints.
 
 Senior YSRC leader and official spokesperson   said that they didn’t want to represent their views before the SIT. “A CBI inquiry can only serve justice to the victims.   minister Ch Ayyanna Patrudu himself has claimed that about 1,700 acres were encroached upon. The SIT has received complaints from 2,500 people pertaining to lands of about 20,000 acres. As the scope of the SIT has now been widened, the scam will be more than 1-lakh acres,” he said.
 
 It is learnt that the YSRC has sourced through RTI details of ownership and other information pertaining to 1,000 acres of land in question. The party says this info is enough to prove the role of   in the scam.
