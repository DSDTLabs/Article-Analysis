NEW DELHI:   will hold a   at   on April 29 against the environment of “distrust and intolerance” in the country.

  general secretary   said after four years of NDA rule in the country, “people of every section of society is feeling suffocated”.
 
 “There is an environment of fear, distrust, and intolerance everywhere,” he said.
 
 The decision to hold the rally comes a day after Congress decided to hold a fast across all districts on April 9 for the cause of “social harmony”. The party stated that violence perpetrated on Dalits during the April 2 “Bharat Bandh” called to protest the Supreme Court order on Prevention of Atrocities Act posed a threat to social amity.
 
 Gehlot said Congress president   believes in democracy based on love and compassion while Modi government is “weakening” the democratic culture of India. “After the NDA came to power, only false promises were made and in the last four years, nobody felt ache din aa gaye hain,” added Gehlot.
