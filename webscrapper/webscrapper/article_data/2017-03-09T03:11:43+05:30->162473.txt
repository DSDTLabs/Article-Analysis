NEW DELHI: The   has given the go ahead to   (NHAI) to award the work of widening Delhi-UP Border to Dasna stretch of   24. 

 This is the most congested section of the highway that connects Delhi with Uttar Pradesh and traffic snarl is a regular feature. This portion will be expanded to 14 lanes. 
 
 Sources in the highways authority said they have already started the process of getting approval of NHAI Board, an inter-ministerial body, so that work can start quickly on this 19.3 km stretch. It has already selected the best bidder. “We are getting it approved by circulating it among the members of NHAI Board rather than waiting for the Board to take it up in a formal meeting. The project has already been delayed because of the court case,” said an NHAI official.
 
 One of the bidders for the Rs 1,600 crore project, which was disqualified by NHAI during technical bidding process, had challenged the decision in the Delhi High Court. This had held up work on this stretch, which passes through densely populated residential and commercial areas such as Indirapuram and Sector-62, Noida. 
 
 Already work is in full swing on the other two sections of this project – Nizamuddin to Delhi-UP Border and Dasna to Hapur.
 
 NHAI officials said land is already available with them for widening of Delhi-UP Border to Dasna stretch and even tree cutting is almost completed. “Since the project is being executed though public private partnership, the selected bidder will get six months to tie up finances for this stretch,” said an official.
 
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a December 2018 deadline for completing the project. NHAI sources said while they are hopeful of meeting the deadline for the two stretches where work is already in full swing, they would take more time for the third section.
