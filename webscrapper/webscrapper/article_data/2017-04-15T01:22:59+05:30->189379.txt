NEW DELHI: The   has upheld New Delhi Municipal Council’s move to summarily   and seal shops from the controversial   premises in central Delhi.

 The civic agency had shut down the hotel over non-payment of license fee last year after court’s nod and had also ended car parking leases and sealed the small shops being run from its premises. The owner of the hotel is currently facing criminal prosecution for alleged involvement in the death of NDMC’s legal advisor.
 
 A bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal recently dismissed the petitions filed by the evicted shopkeepers/tenants reminding them that they had no right to retain the sealed premise after the license was cancelled by NDMC.
 
 The court observed that “a sub-licensee has no greater right than the head licensee.” 
 
 The shop and parking contractors had moved court arguing that NDMC had no right to evict them since they had a valid lease agreement with Prominent Hotel Ltd, the company running Hotel Connaught. 
 
 The petitioners argued that NDMC could either send their dispute to arbitration or file eviction cases instead of sealing their rented shops.
 
 They also complained to HC that in May 2016, NDMC sealed the shops without permitting them to remove their articles and when they sought a fresh deal with the civic agency it refused. On its part the NDMC pointed out to the court that the license deed granted in favour of Prominent Hotels Ltd. was terminated several years ago by it, due to violation of the terms and conditions of the deal.
