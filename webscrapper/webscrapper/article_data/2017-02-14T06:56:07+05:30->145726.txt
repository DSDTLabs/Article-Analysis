The statement said that around 92% of the refunds were below Rs 50,000 due to the high priority given to expeditious issue of refunds to small taxpayers. Only 2% of refunds of under Rs 50,000 are yet to be issued with a majority of these cases relating to recently-filed returns or where a response from taxpayers is awaited.

Recently, the   government had accused the   of holding back refunds to show a healthier fiscal situation.

Over 4 crore ITRs were e-filed till February 10, 2017, which is an increase of 20% over the previous year. Also, more than 60 lakh other online forms were filed, showing a rise of nearly 41%.
