BENGALURU: Sarjapur residents have raised Rs 3 lakh via crowdfunding to translocate four trees that were due to be cut to widen a road. 

 The residents' association began the process of translocating the four trees by   to the roots on Friday and will complete the process by Sunday.
 
  The residents collected Rs 3 lakh to translocate the trees and more than 4,000 families living in apartments, gated communities and villages supported the cause. 
 
  While three trees will be planted in Inventure School, the fourth will be replanted in a Kristal Villa community in Sarjapura. One neem and three peepal trees are very old. Joy V R, secretary of Sarjapura Residents' Welfare Association ( ), said, "On Friday, the trees were pruned and root bowling happened. Jeyam Landscape, a Chennai-based company that has done similar work in Tamil Nadu is applying medicines to the roots and trunks free of cost. By Saturday night, we will have these trees moved to their new homes and by Sunday night, they will be replanted and medicines applied again. We want to set an example - the government and citizens can save trees if there is a will. We convinced police, Bescom and the forest department that it was important to save these 100-year-old trees." 
 
 Vijay Nishant, Bengaluru's tree doctor, supervised the translocation.
