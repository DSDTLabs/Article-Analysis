ROHTAK:   DC   has put a ban on the spending of   and other members of the panchayat for extending wishes to public on occasions like Diwali, Holi, Dussehra, Baisakhi, Makar Sakranti, Ram Navmi, Republic Day and Independence Day.

 In a letter issued on Wednesday, the DC directed the district development and panchayat officer ( ) and block development and panchayat officers (BDPOs) to keep a tab on panchayats that spend money on newspapers using village development fund. The letter reads, “It is a sheer wastage of public money, which can be avoided as the funds are meant for public use.”
 
 The DC observed that the spending in name of greetings by elected panchayats was not in sync with the laid down norms and it also served no public interest. The panchayat department officials have been directed to keep a tab on these and strict action would be taken against erring persons. Confirming the development, Sirsa DDPO Preet Pal Singh said action was taken as elected panchayat members resort to competing with each other by getting big advertisements printed using development funds. “According to development and panchayat norms, they can spend only Rs 500 for the purpose of highlighting their development achievements and anything beyond was illegal,” he maintained.
 
 Ram Singh Sheoran, sarpanch of Bani village, dubbed the DC’s decision as a diktat to impose his authority on them. “We don’t waste panchayat funds by giving advertisements of greetings on special occasions three or four times in a year but it was a way to connect with the people,” he said.
