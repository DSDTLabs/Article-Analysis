AURANGABAD: A half-day   called in support of Shiv Sena MP   threw life out of gear in  , his home town in Osmanabad district, on Monday. Businessmen downed shutters in the morning in response to the bandh and no untoward incidents were reported during the day.

 Members of Shiv Sena had given the bandh call in support of Gaikwad, who is in the news for assaulting Air India staffer in Delhi. Gaikwad was expected to arrive in Umarga on Monday, but didn’t make it to the town with a population of about 40,000.
 
 Except for Umarga town, the bandh call received lukewarm response in other parts of the district. In Umarga too, the traders participated in the bandh reluctantly and that too for a half-day.
 
 “The Shiv Sena had made a representation to the Umarga Vyapari Mahasangh, requesting traders to down shutters. However, we agreed to do so till 3pm in the wake of Padwa festival on Tuesday,” said  , president of Umarga Vyapari Mahasangh.
 
 The association has 600 members in the town. “We had made it clear to them that we could not afford to keep the shops shut for entire day. So, they agreed and we responded by observing a half-day bandh till 3pm,” he said.
 
 Shiv Sena MLA from Umarga Dnyanraj Chougule and other party functionaries also submitted a memorandum to the tehsildar demanding action against the AI staffer, who allegedly misbehaved with the MP. 
 
 “The bandh was limited to Umarga, where his supporters had given the bandh call. It had no impact in other parts of the district,”  , president of Osmanabad district unit of Shiv Sena told TOI.
 
 The police said the bandh was total force till afternoon and then, all the business establishments started working normally.
