THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala has turned out to be a murder ground under the LDF regime, alleged KPCC president V M Sudheeran. 

 "In addition to murders committed by   and   workers, quotation gangs too engage themselves in committing murders. Recent murder at Karuvatta is an example. Some days ago, there was another murder in that area," said Sudheeran in a statement here. 
 
 He alleged that the police were a total failure in booking culprits and bringing them before the law in murder cases. 
 
 "Though they work overtime to suppress agitations against the government, they surrender meekly before goons and quotation gangs," alleged Sudheeran. 
 
 He said that the home department was a total failure as it could not lead the police in the proper direction. 
 
 "Life of common people will become miserable if the police don't initiate steps to book miscreants," he said. 
 
 The UDF will launch a campaign against the LDF government by organizing five regional rallies starting on Sunday. 
 
 Three of the five rallies will begin on Sunday, while Kannur-Wayanad rally will begin on Monday and Kottayam-Idukki rally will begin on Tuesday. 
 
 The formal inauguration of the rallies -- that will also bring alleged wrong policies of the Union government before the attention of the people -- will be done by opposition leader   at Charummoodu near Kayamkulam at 5pm on Sunday. 
 
 KPCC vice-president V D Satheesan will be the captain of this rally, which will tour Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Thrissur districts. 
 
 Sudheeran will inaugurate the southern region rally led by MP   at Gandhi Park here at 5pm on Sunday.
