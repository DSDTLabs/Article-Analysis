HYDERABAD: Justice M   of the Hyderabad High Court on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by   (VHP) seeking permission for its proposed Sri Rama Rath Yatra to be carried out all over Telangana.

 VHPâ€™s Telangana secretary M   filed this plea challenging the denial of permission to them by the police. Agreeing with the version of the state and police, the judge dismissed the VHP plea saying that it was not possible for the police to provide security to the yatra through out the state. The yatra was to be held from Ugadi till Hanuman Jayanti touching all important temples in the state, from Basara to   in   of Secunderabad.
 
 The judge said the court cannot brush aside the views of the police, particularly when they raised concerns about law and order and adequacy of forces. It also said that organisers had not kept in place a plan for night halts and were planning to hold a continuous yatra from March 18 to 31.
 
 Noting that on festival days, there is bound to be more crowd at temples and a yatra of this nature may make things difficult for police, Justice Murti also agreed with contentions of Telangana special counsel   who said that Telangana is a fast growing economy and that authorities cannot afford to allow any injury to the process.
 
 Any untoward incident during such yatras may result in an unwanted dent to the image of the state, Telangana special counsel Sarat Kumar said. The judge then dismissed the plea.
