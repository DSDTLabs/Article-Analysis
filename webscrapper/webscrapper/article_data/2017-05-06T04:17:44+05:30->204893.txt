BENGALURU: The   is not only a gift to India's neighbours but will augment the country's communications sector. It'll join 13 other communication satellites in orbit, allowing India to offer a series of applications to its citizens. Adding to over 200 transponders   owns, the 12 transponders which will be shared with its South Asian neighbours will add to India's communication infrastructure. 

 Isro chairman AS Kiran  , in September 2016, had conceded that India was "significantly short in space". India currently has a 36-satellite constellation spread across observation, communication, navigation and space science.
 
 According to estimates, one third of the 286 satellite transponders India uses were non-Indian with more than 90 hired transponders used specifically for direct-to-home broadcasting, and the severe shortage - with a growing population and increasing number of phone and internet users - had prompted Isro to issue a request for a proposal seeking to lease out some more transponders in December 2016.
 
 "We need to at least double the number of satellites to be able to give reasonable service to the nation," Kumar said, adding that for this, the space agency must also enhance launch capability and reduce satellite-building time.
 
 "Isro is now reaching a stage where we can launch one satellite a month, but that must be increased to at least 1.5 or two launches a month," he said.
 
 While the launch of GSAT-09 will not completely solve this problem, four other launches Isro has lined up for this year is seen to be providing a major boost to areas such as telephone, broadcasting and Internet service, among other things.
