NAINITAL:   high court lawyers called off the boycott of sitting judge Justice   after a meeting convened by Justice   of the court on Saturday. The lawyers agreed to call off strike after the judge assured them no personal remarks will be made on them.
 
   , president of Uttarakhand High Court bar Association said, “Honorable justice assured us of co-operation and appreciation of the courts. We as practitioners of law are flexible and we have reached an understanding.”
  
  Earlier, on Thursday, the Uttarakhand High Court Bar Association announced that it is boycotting the court of a sitting judge Lokpal Singh because he had “misbehaved with lawyers.” At present, around 800 lawyers are members of the association.
  
  The lawyers’ body in its general body meeting on Thursday announced the decision although it did not spell out details of the alleged misbehaviour by the judge.
  
  The association also suspended seven lawyers from membership of the body and served them with notices as they did not agree to the boycott resolution.
