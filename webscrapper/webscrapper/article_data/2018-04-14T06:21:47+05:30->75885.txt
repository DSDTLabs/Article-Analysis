KOCHI: Speedy winds accompanied by heavy rains sent the city into a spin disrupting traffic and leading to waterlogging of many roads in the city and suburbs.

 Ernakulam has received an excess of 48% rains this summer. Officials with disaster emergency operations centre said that a control room has been opened in the district in the wake of summer showers in the city on Friday.
 
 The strong winds resulted in power outages at various parts of the city, including Thrikkakara, Kakkanad, MG Road,   bus stand and parts of SA Road, said an official with district disaster management authority.
 
 Fire and rescue service personnel had a tough time as heavy rain uprooted several trees and huge branches brought down electric posts across the district.
 
 The fire station at   was flooded with calls after trees were uprooted at several parts of the city including Panampilly Nagar, Vyttila, Kadavanthra market, Kacheripady. Since the fire and rescue stations could not handle all the cases, they sought help of other stations like Eloor to clear the trees that fell on roads.
 
 Vehicles parked on roadsides were also damaged when trees fell over it. Fallen trees and electric posts created hardships for people at Nadukani area of Kothamangalam and Mattancherry areas.
