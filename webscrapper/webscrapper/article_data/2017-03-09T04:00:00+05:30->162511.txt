Chennai: PayTM on Wednesday said it has blocked credit cards of nationalised and private banks after it realised that financially savvy merchants and bank staff were exploiting their discount to rotate cash for free credit and loyalty points.

 PayTM in a lengthy blog post described how users started funding their Paytm wallet with their credit cards and transferring it to their bank accounts for free. "They were not only getting free loyalty points, which is in effect free cash but also access to free credit. We were really shocked and disgusted, when we realised what was happening. And we have blocked the cards of users, who were using this loophole in the system to their advantage," said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, CEO, PayTM to TOI over phone.
 
 "It was so uncanny, when we realised bank executives were doing this with the help of their friends and family. A normal merchant - say a chaiwallah - who is dealing with payments of Rs 50-Rs 200 would never think of this. But it takes a member of the banking fraternity to figure out that you can make an interest on Rs 10,000 swiped off your credit card," said Sharma.
 
 The problem arose, when PayTM launched a new payment platform for small merchants at 0% fee in November. "Since millions of merchants accept Paytm at shops/establishments and prefer to move money to their bank accounts -- to democratize payments, we made transfer to bank fee at 0%. This was later extended to all users," said PayTM.
 
 This 0% transfer to bank fee left the opportunity for misuse, when users funded their Paytm wallet with credit cards and transferred it to their bank account for free -- in effect getting loyalty points/cash and free credit.
