PUNE: A sessions court here has convicted and sentenced an   to three years imprisonment for attempting to murder a man by firing a round from his double bore rifle at Wagholi in October 2013. 

 The incident was a fallout of a property dispute between victim   of   in Wagholi and his brother, Anil, who allegedly occupied a plot jointly owned by their mother and sister. Their sister had initiated a civil suit against Anil and the same is pending.
 
 Accused  , who is a friend of Anil, stays in the neighbourhood of Rajesh’s house. He nursed a grudge against Rajesh for helping his sister in the civil suit and was after Rajesh to get her withdraw the suit. 
 
 Around 10.30pm on October 28, 2013, Minhas was on the terrace of his house and called Rajesh, asking the latter to come to his house. 
 
 When Rajesh started heading for the house, Minhas fired a round at him. Luckily, the round missed Rajesh and a complaint of murder attempt was later registered against Minhas with the Lonikand police station. 
 
 In a ruling on Thursday, additional sessions judge N G Gimekar found the accused Minhas guilty of an offence punishable under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code. 
 
 “The court sentenced Minhas to three years imprisonment and a fine of Rs 3,000. In case of the convict failing to pay the fine, he will have to undergo an additional three months imprisonment,” additional public prosecutor Vilas Ghogare-Patil told TOI. 
 
 Ghogare-Patil examined a total of six witnesses in support of the prosecution’s case. “The evidence recorded by Rajesh, his wife, Laxmibai, and the ballistic experts who examined the weapon and the live rounds seized from Minhas, proved crucial in the conviction of the accused,” the prosecutor said.
