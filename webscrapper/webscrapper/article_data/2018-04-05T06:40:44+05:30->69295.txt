KOLKATA: The   station in Eastern Railway’s (ER) Sealdah-Ranaghat section turned into a   on Wednesday morning after hundreds of agitators clashed with the cops and pelted stones on passing trains against an alleged wrong announcement over the public address system.

 Hundreds of office-goers, including HS examinees had a harrowing time as train services remaining suspended for nearly two hours from 9.53am. The   cabin, a ticket counter and several stalls on the platform were also ransacked by the mob. ER cancelled 15 pairs of local trains while 21others were detained at various stations.
 
  (ER), however, said there was no wrong announcement and the demonstration was against the delay in train running due to noninterlocking work at Halisahar. “We had already informed people through newspaper advertisements that trains will be delayed due to this vital work at Halisahar,” an ER spokesperson said.
 
 But people who were part of the agitation claimed that many could have got run over as a ‘through’ train passed the station without any announcement. “An announcement was made about a local train and as people were crossing the tracks to reach the platform when the through train arrived,” one of them said.
 
 10 passengers were injured after demonstrators pelted stones on local trains stranded at the station. Signal equipment and office furniture, including computers were damaged. The agitators were dispersed after a large contingent, including   personnel were deployed.
