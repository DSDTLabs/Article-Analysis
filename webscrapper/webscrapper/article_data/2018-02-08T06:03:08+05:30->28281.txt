MUMBAI: State government on Wednesday told Bombay high court   housed in its homes did not undergo any rehabilitation and ended up spending their entire lives there. 

 "There is no rehabilitation," the government's advocate Abhay   told a bench of justices Naresh Patil and Nitin Sambre in response to their query on the age limit for keeping such inmates in the home.
 
 He said the inmates have been "left or abandoned" by their families and continue living in the homes for life. "It is impracticable to keep them in open society,'' added Patki. There are over 1,500 inmates in shelters run by the Children's Aid Society in the city. Out of these, nearly 350 mentally challenged inmates are housed in the Mankhurd shelter. The oldest inmate is 76 years old, the court was told.
 
 The court heard a PIL based on TOI's report on the New Year's eve party on December 31, 2012 where champagne was consumed and money showered on dancers at the Mankhurd shelter. Twenty-six mentally challenged female inmates were made to attend the party which went on till 3.15 am. At a previous hearing, the court had sought an update on corrective steps taken to ensure such an incident did not recur.
 
 The government's affidavit was submitted to the court. Patki said the seven shelters in Mumbai run by the Children's Aid Society have infrastructure and space problems. There is shortage of staff with one attendant and two cooks per shelter. Also, there is just one attendant to look after the mentally challenged inmates. This prompted justice Sambre to remark, "They have just been left to the mercy of God?"
 
 The government was directed to fill up the 76 vacant posts. They also directed a committee from the   to inspect the homes and submit a report. 
 
 They directed the government to identify land for construction of more shelters and said the "issue of overcrowding and space constraints need to be taken up on priority."
