VADODARA: A non-teaching staff union of M S University has threatened to stage hunger strike at the university campus on Monday. The Gujarat Rajya Pachhatwarg-Baxipunch Karmachari Mandal has said that temporary staffers will sit on a hunger strike protest at the university campus to press for their long pending demands. 

 “We have time and again made representations before   vice-chancellor   and in-charge registrar Dr   to resolve the long pending demands of temporary staffers. But neither the state government nor the university authorities have resolved our problems. Hence, we have decided to go on hunger strike,” said mandal’s president Thakore Solanki. He added that several representations have been made in the past to make temporary staffers permanent in the university system. “There are 600 staffers who are suffering because the issue has not been resolved,” he said.
