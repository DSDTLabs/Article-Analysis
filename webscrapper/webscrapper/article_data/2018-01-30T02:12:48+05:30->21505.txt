NEW DELHI:   Jaswir Singh Chana caught a lucky break after leaving his   in a metro train on   while heading towards IGI from where he was to board a flight to United Kingdom. His bag, which contained currency and   worth lakhs, was returned to him within minutes by   personnel. The passenger was tracked using CCTV surveillance.

 CISF officers said that 5-10 such cases are reported daily and they have devised a swift mechanism to track passengers soon after finding their unattended bags. “We check the bag for its contents and keep it safely so that it can be given back to the owner. In most cases, however, we track the passenger immediately and use CCTV footage to return the bag. A similar procedure was used on Monday when the passenger was still at the platform when we located him,” said a senior CISF officer.
 
 Officers said, in most cases, passengers are in a hurry and forget their bags at the scanning machine. CISF personnel have been asked to keep a check on any bag being left unattended. “If a bag is found unattended for more than 5-10 minutes, it is isolated and the bomb squad is alerted. After clearing the test, CCTV footage is checked to track the passenger, which in some cases is still at the station,” said the CISF officer.
 
 If a passenger loses or forgets their bag, it would in most cases be lying at the station control room, the officer added. The bag returned on Monday contained 900 pounds, a camera, an i-Phone, passport and travelling documents, among other valuables, officials said.
