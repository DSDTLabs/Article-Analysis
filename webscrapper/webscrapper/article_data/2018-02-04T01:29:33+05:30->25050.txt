NEW DELHI:   Anil Baijal on Saturday inaugurated the   in south Delhi with   VC, Udai Pratap Singh, and other DDA officials by planting saplings of bael. The LG also released a booklet on   Valley that the visitors can refer to at the park.

 Located near Sainik Farms and Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, one can have a panoramic view of the Aravali range from the   park. Tilpat Valley was also mentioned in Mahabharata, being one of the five villages Pandavas demanded from Kauravas if they wanted peace. DDA has been developing the biodiversity park since 2015 and it spreads out over an area of nearly 70 hectares, officials said.
 
 Baijal said that biodiversity parks such as Tilpat Valley will play a key role in fighting air pollution as well as recharging the groundwater table of the area, asking DDA officials to bring back the native Aravalli biological communities. He also said three-storey vegetation strips, once developed at the park, will help control air pollution locally. The landscape at the park also consists of savannas, harbour stream woodlands, grasslands and montane forest communities.
 
 Asking officials to promote community participation, the LG said they should facilitate cultural and recreational activities at the biodiversity park. He added that the wealth of medicinal plants at Tilpat Valley should be used for product development by pharmaceutical companies.
