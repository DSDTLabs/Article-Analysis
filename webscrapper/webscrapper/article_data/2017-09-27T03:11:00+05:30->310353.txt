Nagpur: With an aim to bridge the gap between   and army personals a book ‘The Soldier’ was released on Saturday at Scientific Society Hall by Air Vice Marshal Suryakant Chafekar. 

 The book is written by Anuradha Prabhudesai to present the devoted life and mindset of soldiers for protecting the nation. 
 
 Retired defence personnel — Group Captain Dinkar Deshpande, Colonel Abhay Patwardhan, Captain Milind Hastak and Squadron Leader Dr Ravi Wankhede — were felicitated for their extra-ordinary contribution.
 
 The book release function was held by Rajhans Prakashan and Madhur Dahake Smruti Pratishthan.
 
 Writer of the book Prabhudesai, while sharing her experiences from her meetings with soldiers, said, “I have visited many posts of Indian Army in different parts of country. I have seen love in the eyes of every soldier for the country, uniform they wear, honour for the battalion they belong. I have seen soldiers putting civilian’s life before their own.”
 
 “People who enjoy freedom from the comfort of home cannot empathize a soldier’s effort. It is because a soldier is paying it with his blood and life at the borders. Civilians must never forget price of freedom they enjoy” added Prabhudesai.
 
 Speaking about the soldiers in Indian Army, Chafekar said, “Discipline, honour, patriotism, nationalism, bravery, dedication are the real qualities in a soldier, but it not necessary that only soldiers should follow them. When a soldier is guarding the nation, we must show our support to him and his family.”
 
 Talking about the book, the air vice marshal said, “While reading the book I relived the experience I had while serving as a soldier. The book is written from heart which depicts an emotional mindset of soldiers.” 
 
 The writer in the book says that parents must encourage their children to serve in army for at least 5 years.”
