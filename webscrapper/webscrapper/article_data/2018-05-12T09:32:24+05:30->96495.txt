CHANDIGARH: To tackle the problem of paddy straw burning, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed on Friday for setting up of   and bio-CNG plants in the state. The daily capacity of each plant will be around 100 MT of paddy straw.

 The MoU has been signed with Rika Biofuels Development Limited, UK, by the   Bureau of Industrial Promotion (PBIP) and the Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA). The Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB) will facilitate regulatory clearances and incentives by the state government.
 
 The state government will facilitate identification of land parcels in various locations of the state for setting up the plants, and also ensure incentives and benefits as applicable for such plants under the State Industrial and Business Development Policy-2017 and the State NRSE Policy-2012.
 
 The plants will be based on a newly-patented Anerobic Digester concept and straw extruding technology. As many as 10 bio-CNG plants will be set up with an investment of $100-150 million, creating up to 1,000 jobs across the whole operation and supply chain. The aim is to make the first plant operational in 2019.
