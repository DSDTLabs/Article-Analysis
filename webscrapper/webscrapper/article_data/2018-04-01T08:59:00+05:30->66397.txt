Chandigarh: The Haryana government has justified the implementation of   project, saying the new system would improve transparency, help check corruption and make people repose greater faith in panchayati raj institutions.

 Principal secretary (development and panchayats department) Anurag Rastogi said e-panchayat project had been started as part of the transparent governance agenda of the state government. “All related parties must support the noble deed. If any sarpanch or gram sachiv has any doubt or misconception, he/ she can come to discuss things any time,” Rastogi said.
 
 Rastogi added that the project aimed at providing overall benefit to villagers. “That being said, sarpanchs can decide on whether they want to participate in e-panchayat. If any gram panchayat does not want to switch over to e-panchayat, there is no need to protest. Such a request, if any, should come by way of a resolution of the gram panchayat, fully endorsed by the gram sabha,” Rastogi said.
 
 He clarified that the project would not be forcibly imposed on any gram panchayat. Such gram sabhas that decide not to participate would have their financial powers kept at the same level of Rs 10 lakh as before the recent enhancement. Participating gram panchayats would continue to have financial powers of Rs 20 lakh, said the principal secretary.
