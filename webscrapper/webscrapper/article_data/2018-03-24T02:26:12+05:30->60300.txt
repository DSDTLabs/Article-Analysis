GHAZIABAD: The Dilshad Garden-New Bus Stand   project could still meet its June deadline, officials of the   hope, as an impasse over a patch of land required for the fire exits at two stations has been resolved. 

 “At the Mohan Nagar and New Bus Stand metro stations, we needed over 100sqm to build the fire escape routes. The land was owned by two private parties — RED Mall and Mohan Meakin Limited — who were not willing to part with it at the price offered. The matter has now been resolved,” GDA vice-chairperson Ritu Maheshwari said. 
 
 Officials said the GDA had offered Rs 65,000 per sqm for the land.
 
 The DMRC, which is implementing the project, is also striving to meet the deadline. “Construction work on the   metro project is almost complete. As of now, we are working on the signalling and electrification. We hope to complete well in time,” said a   spokesperson. 
 
 “Infrastructure work on 12 of the 14 buildings in the eight metro stations on the route has been done. The remaining two — at Arthala and New Bus Stand station — is in the last stage,” the spokesperson added.
 
 While the GDA has released Rs 695 crore, the housing board has given Rs 201 crore and the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation Rs 43 crore until now.
 
 The Centre, however, is yet to release its share of Rs 402 crore. The GDA hopes the matter would resolved at the earliest.
 
 “The project has not been approved by the Union urban development ministry, because of which the central funds are stuck. However, we have requested the state government in a recent meeting to prevail upon the ministry to grant its permission. We have been assured it would be done soon,” Maheshwari said.
 
 The 9.41-km metro extension is proposed to have eight stations in Ghaziabad - Shaheed Nagar, Raj Bagh, Rajendra Nagar, Shyam Park, Mohan Nagar, Arthala, river Hindon and New bus stand.
