KOLKATA: Union junior power minister R K Singh called up Bengal power minister   on Tuesday over the Rs 1,200 crore Power Grid Corporation of India project that has lurched into uncertainty over the   stalemate. 

 Singh sought a status update on the project and urged Chattopadhyay to push for its completion. Once completed, the project will transmit power from West Bengal to Purnia in Bihar. The Union minister also said he would take up the issue with chief minister   once she returns from her   tour. 
 
 Under an apolitical banner, villagers have been staging protests in Bhangor since January 2017 after two locals were killed in a police-agitators stand-off.
 
 Chattopadhyay later told reporters he assured Singh of the issue gradually getting settled. He said those leading the protests were losing support of locals. He further said he had received letters from landowners who at one point had backed the movement. 
 
 “They have told us that they now understand it was a politically motivated movement by outsiders and they were being misguided. The villagers are directly meeting me...I have also informed the Union minister about the unscientific rumours that were being systematically spread,” Chattopadhyay said.
 
 The Bengal minister, however, made it clear the CM had said no land would be taken over forcefully unless legal landholders willingly handed over the plot for the stalled project. 
 
 He pointed out that among the 293 landowners who need to give up plots for the project, almost 95% have agreed and received compensation. “We are trying to convince the others. Also, earlier Rs 15 crore was distributed as compensation and now another Rs 4.6 crore has been given out among land-losers proportionately. It is only because four or five land poles could not be erected after the project entered North 24 Parganas that it has been stalled since 2017,” Chattopadhyay said.
