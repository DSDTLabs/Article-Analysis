Nagpur: A Hindi play, ‘Ujjbak Raja Teen Dacoits’, which depicts the lopsided system of our country, was presented by Rangrasiya Theatre at Shri Sai Sabhagruha, Shankar Nagar on Sunday evening. The story was written by Alakhnandan while Sandeep Daberao directed it.

 The play begins with the story of a useless and stupid king who cares for nothing but wearing good clothes. He doesn’t associate himself with the affairs of his state. The beauty of the play lay in the deep beliefs which shine through the commonplace situations and conversations. 
 
 The story progresses when three fraudsters meet the king posing as international tailors to prepare a new dress for him. They assure the king that they will prepare magical suits which will be intriguing, eye-catching but invisible to silly people. 
 
 Subsequently the king wears what he thinks are new clothes and parades in his village. But seeing him, the villagers make fun of him but the king, remembering what he had been told by the fraudsters, considers the villagers stupid who cannot see his magical suit. But, when a passer-by cackles at him and pours water on him, the king realizes that he has been made a fool of and that he was not wearing any dress.
 
 He also goes to meet another king who tells him he too had been duped by the fraudsters. Both the kings realize how the ‘dacoits’ made fool out of them and made a lot of money. 
 
 The packed   reciprocated to the wonderful presentation of the play with appreciative hoots and loud laughs.
 
 “The idea behind the play is to depict what happens to the state of affairs in the society when the throne is owned by an imprudent king. It only results in the suffering of innocent people,” said Daberao.
 
 “The play had us laughing from beginning to end. The actors too played their parts very well and now we are waiting for the next dhamaka,” said Samiksha Rokade from the audience.
