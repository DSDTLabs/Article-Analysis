Surat: Body of a 13-year-old schoolboy was found near the railway crossing in Limbayat area of the city on Saturday.   revealed that the boy, missing since Friday, had died after his face was crushed with a stone by someone.

 Family members alleged police inaction at Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER) and did not allow post-mortem (PM) to be conducted on the body of   found near   village. Senior police officials eventually calmed their anger and they allowed post-mortem to be conducted on the body. However, family members wanted action against police officers who did not take interest in the investigation of the case about the missing boy after a complaint was registered at Limbayat police station. The family members alleged that the police took their complaint but instructed them to search for him on their own and to come on Saturday. 
 
 Police are questioning locals to find out if they had noticed anyone in the area with the teenager. They are exploring if some known person had taken the boy away since no one saw the child being kidnapped.
