NEW DELHI: A week after he was sworn in, lieutenant governor   will hit the streets on Sunday morning to take   officials to Saket for a cleanliness check drive. 

 This is the beginning of an attempt to get civic bodies and other departments in charge of sanitation to keep the city clean. 
 
 This field visit is significant, as it comes in the backdrop of an ongoing strike by   staff who are protesting against the non-payment of salaries. 
 
 Baijal’s visit is not an impromtu inspection but a planned exercise. It is to take a round of the area around Saket to address the complaints and to make way for improvements. 
 
 He may visit the Saket court and its vicinity. Baijal will be continue to make frequent field trips in the future. 
 
 Meanwhile, Baijal’s first week saw him take to twitter, hold meetings with government officers,   top brass and give approval to nursery admission guidelines for schools on public land.
