CHENNAI: Communist Party of India (Marxist) state unit secretary   has demanded legal action against Pallikaranai policemen for beating party cadres and making sexual remarks against women members of allied unions during a demonstration against demonetisation held on   on Saturday. A photojournalist belonging to a Tamil newspaper 'Theekathir' who photographed the beatings was attacked and the photographs were deleted from his camera. 

 In a statement, Ramakrishnan said, "Police assaulted members of the   (DYFI) when they questioned them for making sexual remarks at women protestors. When other members protested they were locked up in a marriage hall nearby and beaten." Ramakrishnan also alleged that CPI(M) members who went to the marriage hall to question the brutality were lathicharged and chased away. Many including CPI(M) south Chennai executive committee member G Selva who were injured at various points had to be taken to the Rajiv Gandhi government hospital,   government hospital and private clinics. 
 
 According to Ramakrishnan, women members locked inside the marriage hall were sexually abused and men mercilessly beaten. "CPI(M)'s human rights wing had recently exposed the killing of a prisoner inside the jail at   police station. We suspect that the police acted in vengeance," Ramakrishnan said.
