AHMEDABAD: A consumer court here has asked   to deposit Rs 25,000 with the consumer welfare fund and to pay Rs 6,000 to a customer for selling biscuit packets having less weight than the value printed on the packet. 

 The court imposed   on the company with observation that people in general have been at loss and this is like exploiting the consumers.
 
 In this case, Naranpura resident Laljibhai Patel purchased six packets of Marie Gold biscuits in July 2012. The net quantity printed on the packets was 122.5 gram. He suspected a little variance in quantity and got it verified with an ISO 9001 laboratory at   to find out that four packets contained less quantity of biscuits than 122.5g with one packet weighing only 104g.
 
 As Patel sued the company with the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Ahmedabad (city), the company replied that it has got sophisticated manufacturing plant to maintain international standard quality. It submitted that biscuits are manufactured and packaged by automated machine and the product is made as per provisions of Rule 22 of Legal Metrology (packaged commodity) Rules, 2011. Variation in weight is possible due to weather and transportation. If the packet had a lower quantity, it must be an inadvertent error. Britannia also said that it manufactures and markets bakery products for 90 years and is an established brand name.
 
 The consumer argued that reduction in weight of the product is nearly 7-8%, and hence it does not fall in the exception of the metrology rules. The court obtained second report in April 2017, and found little difference from the first report. 
 
 However, all four packets weighed less than the printed value, and one sample was found to be of 107.7g.
 
 The court said that permissible error for weight variance is 117g and there was only one packet found to be below this level. This is not a negligible difference and it is more than the maximum permissible error.
