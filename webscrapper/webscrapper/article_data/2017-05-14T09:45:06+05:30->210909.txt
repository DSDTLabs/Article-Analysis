It's a struggle for 16-year-old   to hold, and flip through the pages of a book.But that didn't stop this determined young lad from scoring 82% in the 2017 SSLC examination. All of seven when he was afflicted by his disorder, Kanhaiya has been bound to a wheelchair since. However, never once has he thought of giving up on his dreams because of his disability.

 “I always ask my mother's help to hold a book, and she never denies me. She's like an extension of my own body,“ said Kanhaiya. His mother Shree Lakshmi is immensely proud of her son. “He's scored 82%, but I couldn't be happier if he had scored 100%. The board gave him an additional hour to write the exam, and allotted a scribe. I am proud of him, not because he's my son, but because he never allowed his disability to become a handicap,“ said Shree Lakshmi. 
 
 A   student, science is Kanhaiya's favourite subject, said his mother. “He wants to continue his education, and help those suffering from disorders similar to his. I want my son to be an inspiration for the world.What more can a mother expect from her son?“ asked Shree Lakshmi.
 
 “I want to become a scientist and serve my nation,“ said Kanhaiya.
