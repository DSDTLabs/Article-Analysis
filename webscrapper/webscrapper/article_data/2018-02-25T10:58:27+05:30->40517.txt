MARGAO: It has been nearly a week that litres and litres of water is flowing freely into the nullah near  , located opposite the   ( ) building.

 The issue was raised by a MMC councillor during the council meeting held on Monday. MMC officials conducted a site inspection on the following day. However, the problem persists. When contacted, PWD assistant engineer (AE) Vijay Kudchadkar told STOI that the water is “nullah water”. But local motorcycle taxi riders (‘pilots’) who have their taxi stand situated nearby point out that if it were indeed sewerage water, there would have been a terrible stink. “The authorities must inspect where this leakage is originating from and plug it immediately. Sewerage water cannot be released into open drains as it poses a health hazard,” said the motorcycle taxi rider.
 
  resident Nevil Furtado claims the authorities are confusing the media claiming that the water is sewerage water. He blames the MMC for its failure to act against the shop keepers in the Margao New Market who have illegally built their shops over the Portuguese era storm water drains, thus, blocking these drains. “The MMC is aware that these are storm water drains. In 2011 they cleared out the plastic bottles that were blocking these drains. The MMC is in connivance with the culprits of the illegalities as they do not wish to open the storm water drains,” said Furtado.
 
 While the MMC chairperson Babita Angle Prabhudessai is presently out of station, MMC vice chairperson Tito Cardozo was not available for comments.
