 Speaking with TOI over phone, Bukhari, who had openly supported the SP even sharing the dais with Mulayam Singh Yadav during the 2012 polls, said, “They cheated Muslims and supported the BJP in forming a government at the Centre. Only five MPs from Mulayam Singh Yadav's family were sent to the Lok Sabha back then. SP leaders have failed to address the issues related to Muslims which they promised in 2012.“
