NEW DELHI: The death of   happened ironically when he was on duty to   indulging in speeding. The   have been conducting raids to nab speeding truck drivers who try to leave the city before the restriction hours kick in. Kumar’s colleagues said that he was a specialist in flagging down vehicles.

 “Many cases of traffic rule violations were being reported from Geeta Colony flyover. To curb such incidents, a special team with an interceptor vehicle was deployed there,” a traffic police officer said.
 
 On Saturday, Kumar was posted with the interceptor team. Each cop gets deployed with the team on a fortnightly basis. Kumar’s two-hour shift, which started at 5am was scheduled to end at 7am. A new team was supposed to take over and was on its way. At 6:50am, Kumar was hit by the truck.
 
 Kumar, from Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, had joined   in 2010 and was deputed to the traffic department. He is survived by his parents, two brothers, a wife and a three-year-old daughter who stay in his hometown.
 
 ASI Kanhaiya Lal, who was with Kumar at the time of the incident said, Kumar had also completed his post-graduation alongside his job. He was one of the few PG degree holders of the batch.
 
 “He was very happy with the job and was always upbeat about it. We were working together for the past four-and-a-half-months. The accident happened just before we were about to leave,” he said.
 
 Preliminary autopsy suggests that an injury at the back of the head led to his death. The team took Kumar to a hospital where he remained unconscious and later died of internal bleeding. The body was handed over to the family members and was taken to Aligarh on Saturday evening after the postmortem.
 
 Family members told his colleagues that Kumar had been saving money to build a house near a school in Aligarh where he intended to admit his daughter.
