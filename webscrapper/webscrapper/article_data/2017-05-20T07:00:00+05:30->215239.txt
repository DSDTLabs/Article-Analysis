 Arya claimed a threat to his life and liberty due to the stand taken by him on certain political issues and excesses committed by the dominant and largest community in the state. In his petition, Arya (a resident of  ) submitted that being president of ‘Sarvjan’ party, he had to visit places across Haryana, and had submitted a representation to the state government on February 1, 2017, seeking security cover. He has claimed that the state government was not providing him any security, apprehending a reaction from the state’s dominant community.
 
 Accusing former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh   for playing Jat politics in the state, Arya also claimed he had clandestinely helped community members build up an agitation for reservation. Arya was a member of the Haryana assembly from the erstwhile   seat from 1982 to 1987. He has also been chairman of Haryana Seed Development Corporation (HSDC) from 2006 to 2008. A former Congress leader, Arya joined   before the last state assembly polls.
 
 At present, he is facing several criminal cases due to his alleged inflammatory speeches against the Jat community, and had also remained behind bars. He is also facing a case of cheating, related to grant of CLU (change of land use) licence during the Hooda regime.
