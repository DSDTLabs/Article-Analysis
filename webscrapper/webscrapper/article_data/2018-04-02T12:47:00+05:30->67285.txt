Actress-model   seems to have drawn her husband   to the modelling side as she posed alongside him in a set of images for her latest   line.

 
  
 According to a report, flaunting the latest looks from her label Inamorata swimwear, the 26-year-old   looked hot as she lapped up the sun, as her husband looked on.
 
 Clad in a red pair of sweats, her partner looked on as Ratajkowski gave the typical sultry swimwear, closed-eye gaze.
