PUNE: A   in the city has directed a travel and tour operator and an insurance company to jointly pay Rs 28.93 lakh compensation to a 31-year-old youth who was rendered physically disabled after a road accident in December 2013.
 
 Victim Rahul Sheshrao Kulkarni, a resident of Dalvinagar in Chinchwad, had set out on a tour of Kerala and Kanyakumari along with his friends and relatives in the last week of December 2013. They had hired a Tavera car from Channamalleshwar tours and travels in Chinchwad. The car was insured by Cholamandalam MS,   located in Pune Camp.
 
 According to the victim, the car driver was driving the vehicle at a high speed and in a rash and negligent manner and despite repeated warnings by the occupants, the driver did not pay heed to their request to drive in a controlled manner.
  
 On January 2, 2014 while they were proceeding from Tirunelvelli to Kanyakumari, the car dashed against a truck on the Kanyakumari bypass near ISRO. This resulted in grievous injuries to Rahul who was rushed to the government hospital in Kanyakumari. The victim has since been certified by medical authorities as rendered 85% disabled and unable to do his private work.
  
 Rahul had filed an accident claim petition before MACT chairman Prithviraj Chavan in Pune and the same was settled recently. The tribunal held that the tour and travel operator and the insurance company can not escape liability for causing physical disability to the victim and must pay compensation to the victim for the same.
