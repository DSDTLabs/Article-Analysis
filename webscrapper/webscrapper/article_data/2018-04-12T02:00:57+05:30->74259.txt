GURUGRAM: Green activists in the city have written to the  , asking them to fill up   in the  , after a carcass of a   was discovered in the   area of the forested hill tracts.

 The activists alleged that most watering holes in the area, originally dug up by the forest department, are drying up fast due to rising temperatures, and there is no regular mechanism in place to transport water to these holes. 
 
 “The nilgai which collapsed and died close to a drying, muddy watering hole near Kadarpur, is proof that water holes are drying up due to rising temperatures, with authorities not doing their bit and filling up these holes. It is disheartening to see precious wildlife dying due to lack of upkeep,” said environmentalist Vaishali Rana Chandra.
 
 Shivani Sharma, honorary animal welfare officer appointed by the   (AWBI), said, “As the nilgai has died so close to the muddy watering hole, it is evident the animal didn’t get water. Most watering holes dug for wild animals by the forest department in the Aravalis have started drying up. Authorities should have filled up th-ese watering holes well ahead. There is now an urgent need to revive all these watering holes.” 
 
 Vinod Kumar, chief conservator of forests (wildlife, Gurugram circle), told TOI, “We have an agreement with a non governmental organisation to fill up nine of the watering holes in the Aravalis, but there is a delay from their end this year. However, we assure you we will get all the watering holes filled soon. We have already borrowed a tanker from the territorial wing of the department to carry out the task.”
 
 There are over 20 watering holes in various areas adjoining the city, including Bandhwari, Sohna, Raisina hills, Faridabad and Gwalpahari. In the last four months alone, there have been 11 leopard sightings and four successful leopard rescue operations in and around Gurugram.
