Ahmedabad: Gujarat ATS on Saturday arrested one Javed alias Ziauddin Chauhan of Chhota Udepur for allegedly providing seven small firearms in three consignments to the co-accused to avenge the death of Muslims in the post-Godhra riots.

 ATS officials said a case was registered in 2003 at the city crime branch. This case came to be known as the ISI conspiracy case. “Javed’s name had surfaced during interrogation of the co-accused,” an ATS official said. “Javed, who used to shuttle between Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, had been absconding for 14 years.” 
 
 It may be noted that 22 accused were convicted and 22 acquitted by the Pota court in 2010 in the ISI conspiracy case. The investigators had alleged that Pakistan’s intelligence agency, ISI, had hatched a conspiracy with Pak-based terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba to provided terror training to some Gujarat youths to avenge the death of Muslims during the post-Godhra riots.Sources in the ATS claimed that the money to procure arms and explosives were routed to India through Mumbai-based Abdul Latif money transfer agency and by illegal hawala operators. ACP Ramesh Faldu of ATS said it was alleged that with this money Javed had travelled to Madhya Pradesh several times and bought a total of seven firearms, including pistols and revolvers. “The arms were delivered to some of the co-accused in three consignments,” Faldu said.
 
 ATS officials said they had handed over the accused to the city crime branch for further investigation. 
 
 Incidentally, underworld don Dawood Ibrahim is the key absconding accused in the case. Murder of former BJP minister Haren Pandya was part of the same conspiracy, says the chargesheet submitted by the city crime branch in the court. ATS sleuths are tracking the source of the weapons procured by Javed from Madhya Pradesh. “We will be sending a team to Madhya Pradesh to track down the person who sold weapons to Javed,” ATS official said.
