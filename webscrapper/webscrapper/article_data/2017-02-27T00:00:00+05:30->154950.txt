Benglauru band Swarathma’s latest video, Beta Sweater Peheno, sees the bandmates revisit their schooldays. They are dressed in school uniforms, with   sporting a girl’s uniform and two ponytails. Speaking about the idea behind the song,   says, “We have used ‘sweater’ as a metaphor for the safe path. What is common among all generations of parents is that somewhere they believe that they know what’s better for their kids. Vasu, who has directed the video as well, came up with visual metaphor of the school, which is used to denote the pressure.”
Vasu says, “We wanted to bring out the feeling of seclusion and not being in a natural environment. The five characters in the video are all alone in an empty space — even if they are in a classroom or a playground, it is just these five guys and no one else.” Seeing five grown men in school uniforms is bound to attract stares. “I was cautious about not portraying myself as a girl.  , I am dressed as a girl, but if my mannerisms are too feminine, then it’s making a mockery of women and girls,” says Vasu. 
 The band’s aim with this video is to look at what really is happening to children. And while any song or art form may not be able to change everything that’s happening around us,   feels that it can definitely start a conversation. “We keep that in mind when we present our work. We are not being preachy or rebels. We are also victims of this pressure. But we don’t want to make it look like a sad story since we have also reaped the benefits of the pressure. But, we need to go back and think about the impact,” Vasu sums up.
