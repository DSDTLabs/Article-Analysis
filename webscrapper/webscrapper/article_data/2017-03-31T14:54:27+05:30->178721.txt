NEW DELHI: With the goods and services tax (GST) Bill in the final stage of receiving parliamentary nod — the Upper House takes it up next week after the Lower House passed four   legislations on Wednesday — Prime Minister   wants   MPs to take the message on this big reform to the people.
 
  The   will brief ruling party MPs on GST, senior officials told ET. These officials spoke off record.
  
  Also, all state units and MLAs of Bharatiya Janata Party have been asked to spread the message on GST during the week April 6-14 — April 6 is the party's foundation day and April 14 is BR Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
  
  A senior government official told ET that the prime minister wanted the "GST message to travel to the people" so that full information on "the tax reform's architecture" is understood widely.
  
  "The aim will be to explain the   simply, without economic jargon. It is a big decision and the PM wants people to have a clear idea of GST, its implications and how they stand to gain from it," the official quoted earlier said.
  
  There will also be interactions-cum-workshops for journalists, academics and opinion-makers. Senior ministers may host live sessions on Facebook.
  
  "The PM's directives are to use every platform, including social media, to take the GST message home before the rollout happens from July 1," said another senior official.
  
  As part of reach-out efforts during April 6-14, BJP office-bearers will also make efforts to communicate the benefits of the PM’s less-cash economy drive, with particular focus on getting as many people on board as possible on using digital payments apps like BHIM.
