BENGALURU: Pink balloons and women staff with pink dupattas welcomed voters at   in   ward,   assembly constituency. It was one of the 100 Pink polling stations, with all-woman staff. While some women at these booths were initially irritated on finding men in the line, they later realised that the booths were open for men too.

 Archana Bharadwaj, a young mother, was all praise for the initiative. “It’s a sign of women’s empowerment,” she said.
 
 However, at a pink booth in Kumaraswamy Layout in Padmanabhanagar constituency, a woman was upset with the staff as her private ID card was not accepted as valid ID proof. “I got my voter ID card, but they said my photo didn’t match my face. I kept arguing with them and they finally let me vote,” she said.
 
 In a pink booth at Jnana Jyothi School, Yelahanka, women agents of parties clad in pink saris were seen assisting women and escorting senior citizens.
 
 In Mysuru, the   booths set up by the EC to encourage women voters received a thumbs up from many women even as some said it was humbug.
 
 For  , the pink booth didn’t make any difference as she had to brave the queue like in previous elections.
