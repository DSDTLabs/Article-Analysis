Vadodara: The bodies of soldiers Sunil Patel and Deva Parmar, who could not survive an avalanche that hit the line of control (LOC) in Jammu and Kashmir, were brought to the city on Tuesday.

 Several army men and district authority officials reached SSG Hospital late in the evening to receive the bodies of the martyred soldiers. Their bodies were to be airlifted to their hometowns in Godhra and Bhavnagar on Tuesday. But, since the bodies reached late to the city, these will now be airlifted on Wednesday.
 
 Sources at the SSG Hospital said that the bodies have been kept in the cold storage and their families have also been informed about it.
 
 Shopkeepers in Godhra have voluntarily decided to keep their shops closed on Wednesday to mourn Patelâ€™s death. District authorities of Panchmahals have also made preparations for his funeral.
