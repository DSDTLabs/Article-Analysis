MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena is seething after   Devendra Fadnavis failed to   party chief   Thackeray at Vidhan Bhavan, as scheduled on Wednesday, even after the latter waited for two hours. 

 A senior Sena functionary said that to add insult to injury, Fadnavis met Narayan Rane, Sena’s bete noir, while Thackeray waited at Shivalay, the party office, a stone’s throw from Vidhan Bhavan. “This is how BJP treats its ally,” hissed the functionary.
 
 However, the CM later had a long conversation with Uddhav. He assured Uddhav that the issues raised in his letter would be resolved.
 
 Though the meeting had been fixed for Wednesday, they could not meet as the CM was   in the legislature. Thackeray had sought an appointment with Fadnavis early this week to discuss judicious allocation of MLA funds and other “urgent issues”, he said. Uddhav arrived at Shivalay at the appointed hour but the CM’s office requested him to wait for half an hour as Fadnavis was busy in the assembly, replying to a crucial discussion.
 
 Meanwhile, Rane entered the Vidhan Bhavan to meet Fadnavis. On learning of this, Thackeray chose to bide his time at Shivalay, even as Sena ministers were trying to get the CM to meet Thackeray.
 
 Fadnavis was on his feet in the assembly, while Rane plonked himself in the CM’s office. Rane wanted the CM to use his good offices and seek Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appointment for the inauguration of a hospital in the coastal Konkan region, Rane’s one-time bastion.
 
 The Sena is furious that Fadnavis should squeeze in time for Rane but could not get to roll out the red carpet for Thackeray for a pre-scheduled ‘chai pe charcha’.
 
 Having cooled his heels for over two hours at Shivalay, Thackeray informed the CMO that he was leaving for his next appointment. “There surely was some misunderstanding in the CMO. Devendraji will never treat Sena president in an impolite manner,” said a BJP minister.
