Bhopal: The Dalit Kamal Singh Uikey, resident of Sewania Goud, finally can look forward to a permanent toilet at his residence.

 Revenue minister and Bhopal (South) MLA Umashankar Gupta, helped dig a pit to lay the foundation for construction of toilet at the house of Uike on Sunday. The move coincided with state BJP celebrating Prime Minister Narendra Modi birthday as 'Seva Diwas'.
 
 BJP president Amit Shah’s visit to Uikey’s house for lunch, during his visit of August 20 led to a major embarrassment for the state government when it was found that the house does not have a toilet. Bhopal district has been declared open defecation free (ODF).
 
 After the embarrassment a temporary toilet was set up at his home the very next day by the district administration.
 
 Sewania Goud area was abuzz with activity since morning. Land for the toilet was given corporator Santosh Singh Uikey. A total of 1,164 toilets have been constructed in Sewania Goud, he said. An amount of Rs 13,600 was sanctioned for each of the individual toilets, he said.
 
 Gupta said that community toilets will be constructed for people where toilets could not be constructed in their houses.
 
 In 2017, Bhopal was one of the first cities in the state to be declared ODF free in MP. In 2016, Uikey family, that includes seven people, had applied for construction of an individual toilet to the BMC. However, the beneficiary did not pay the required contributory amount of Rs 1,375 and hence the construction was not approved.
 
 Meanwhile, under the Sewa Diwas programmes finance minister Jayant Malaiya participated in “Swachhta Hi Sewa” campaign at Panchsheel Nagar ward -47 of Bhopal today. He began the campaign by digging a pit at the residence of Dinesh Chawriya.
 
 A press release from BMC said a total of 400 new toilets have been constructed in Panchsheel Nagar. Construction work of 200 toilets will be completed in the area by October end.
