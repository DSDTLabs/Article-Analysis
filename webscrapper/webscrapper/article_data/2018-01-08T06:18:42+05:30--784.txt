BENGALURU: Though construction activities are rampant in the city, there is a clear lack of an action plan to treat debris. Thousands of tonnes of construction debris generated every day is dumped by roadsides, on vacant stretches of land and lakebeds on the city’s outskirts.

 In an attempt to ensure that debris finds a sustainable end, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is coming up with a project to process it and produce tiles and bricks.   commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad said the government is coming up with a plant to process construction debris at Bellahalli quarry, 25km north of Bengaluru. He was speaking at The Times of India-sponsored event, conducted in   on Saturday.
 
 The plant is coming up at a cost of Rs 2.5crore, which will be borne by the agency.
 
 Citizens will have to shell out Rs 130 per tonne of construction waste produced at their premises, to be collected by a transportation agency. The BBMP is yet to call tenders for the transportation agency that will ferry the debris from the construction site to the processing unit. While the project has been approved by the BBMP health standing committee, the council’s approval has been sought.
 
 He was responding to a query raised by residents on the increasing problem of construction waste that ends up by roadsides.   from   pointed out that the debris can be reused. “The question is about who produces the debris and who wants the debris. Debris can be used in the construction,” said Suchitra, an architect. Currently, contractors who collect debris dump it in Bellahalli quarry without removing the metal components, which have a high recyclable value.
