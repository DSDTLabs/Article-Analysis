CHENNAI: Opposition parties have criticised the state government's silence on Andhra Pradesh going ahead with   across the Palar river.

 DMK working president  , in a statement on Saturday, lashed out at chief minister  , asking him to look into the issues confronting the state instead of concentrating on the turf war within his party. The   has also criticised the government's silence on the Palar issue.
 
 “The chief minister recently told the assembly that the state government had filed a case in the   against the AP decision and till the court delivered its verdict, check dam would not be constructed. But the works undertaken in the Kuppam constituency , represented by Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandra babu Naidu, are contrary to Panneerselvam's claims,“ said Stalin. Stalin also said the chief minister must see to it that his orders alone were implemented by the government, in an apparent reference to the alleged interference of Sasikala and her family members.
 
 Meanwhile, the PMK also expressed similar views. “ As usual, the government must have sought reports from the officials concerned.Before the reports are submitted, the works undertaken by the AP government will be completed. The government must come out of its slumber and act fast,“ said PMK founder S Ramadoss in a statement.
 
 The state government filed a petition in the Supreme Court in July last year. But it failed to get any order from the court. “Had Tamil Nadu got an order from the SC, AP would not have gone ahead with the works across Palar,“ Ramadoss said.
