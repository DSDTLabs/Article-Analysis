BENGALURU: CM   will present his last budget of his current tenure on February 15 with an outlay pegged at around Rs 2.1 lakh crore. With   due in April-May, the state budget is likely to be full of sops and preparations will begin with the first pre-budget meeting on Thursday.

 While the budget might be big on ambition, it will be tempered by the government’s underachievement in terms of budgeted estimates for this fiscal. Records show that the total expenditure barely crossed the halfway mark and 23 departments have not even spent 50% of their funds. Against its estimated expenditure of Rs 1,78,385 crore by March 31 this year, the government spent only Rs 99,774 crore till the end of December. And of the estimated capital expenditure of Rs 33,640 crore, only Rs 14,585 crore has been spent so far.
 
 While independent analysts accuse the government of “sleeping through the year”, officials say spending has picked up since December.
