GURUGRAM: Academic activities at five   in Gurgaon has taken a beating with about 250 ‘extension lecturers’ going on an indefinite strike to press for better remuneration. 

 Agitating under the banner of All   Extension Lecturers’ Association that launched a state-level strike on Monday, the lecturers alleged that the government had failed to implement the Punjab and Haryana High Court’s directive (dated May 5, 2016) to pay   as per UCG norms. 
 
 Currently, an extension lecturer draws Rs 250 per lecture, with a cap of Rs 18, 000 per month.“This is unfair. If I take four classes a day and work for at least 20 days a month, I should ideally get Rs 20,000. But the cap ensures we don’t get more than Rs 18,000,” an extension lecturer, who teaches at Government College in Sector 14, said on condition of anonymity. 
 
 A rough estimate suggests there are almost 2,500 extension lecturers in the state, as against the regular staff count of 1,800. “We make up for over 50 % of the teaching staff across government colleges in Haryana. With more and more permanent lecturers nearing their retirement age, the ratio is going to increase in coming days. Yet, we are meted out a stepmotherly treatment,” another extension lecturer rued.
 
 Sharma, also an extension lecturer, who only revealed his surname, said there was no post of “extension lecturer” at the first place. “There are just two posts: permanent and ad-hoc. But the government had come up with this ‘extension lecturer’ concept to run government colleges without any hitch. We carry over 50% of the workload, but do not get paid for it,” he added.
 
 “The strike will continue till the government agrees to meet our demands,” said Sumer Siwach, spoksperson, All Haryana Extension Lecturers’ Association. “Our main demand is fixed salary.”
