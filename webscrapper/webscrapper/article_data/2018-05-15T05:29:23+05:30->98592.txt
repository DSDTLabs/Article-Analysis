AHMEDABAD: As part of the ongoing drive to plug the multi-crore business of illegal   in  , state DGP   on Monday sent a letter to all police units, ordering a high-level probe in every case of illegal   seizure above Rs 5 lakh.

 According to the notification, every such case will be directly supervised by additional or joint commissioner of police in city areas and deputy inspector general of police or inspector general of police in police ranges. Such cases will be reviewed in monthly crime conferences, the letter says.
 
 The letter directed the officials to investigate such factors as which distillery the seized stock came from, who purchased the stock and who made the payment, who owned the vehicle or vehicles that ferried the liquor, and who was meant to be the receiver of the stock in Gujarat. Officials will also have to determine why a particular route was chosen for ferrying the stock and whether any police official was involved in the chain.
 
 Experts said that the notification can have the double-edged effect. “It will surely put pressure on police officials to conduct a thorough investigation and find common links if the stock is procured from a specific location or person repeatedly,” said an official on the condition of anonymity. “Major routes, especially from the border areas to specific spots, will also be identified. But it might also lead to situations where the stock’s value is shown to be lower than Rs 5 lakh to avoid the procedure. The figures of the first month will reveal the trend.” 
 
 According to the figures tabled in the state legislative assembly, Gujarat reported the seizures of 554 litres of   per hour in 2017.
