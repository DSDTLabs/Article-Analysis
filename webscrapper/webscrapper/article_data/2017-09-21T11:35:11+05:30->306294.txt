MOHALI: The open spaces in dividers have passed the police and Greater   Area Development Authority ( ) checks and are now posing a major threat, risking the lives of everyday commuters who tend to cross road in the middle of sectorial intersections.

 There are many such illegal crossings on major roads of the city. Moreover, police has no data of challans issued to violators illegally jumping dividers on various roads in city.
 
 On Tuesday night, a Verna car collided head on with a truck after it jumped the divider from an illegal cut and rammed on the other side of the lane. The police believes that the car driver might have survived the crash in the presence of a proper divider and had the railings been there in place.
 
 The most dangerous of the cuts is the one made in a separator near s-turning on airport road near the controversial   where commuters make blind u-turns posing a threat to their lives and that of the others.
 
 It is one of the busiest roads of the city with thousands of vehicles speeding from the spot during day.
 
 Police officials told that they have several times approached and written to GMADA to mend such illegal openings as the 200-feet airport road falls under their jurisdiction. Mohali SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “I will ask the superintendent of police (SP traffic) to take immediate action and challan such violators. We will send another reminder to GMADA to close these unruly overtures.”
 
 Another such illegal cut can be seen opposite aero city, opposite to Sector 82 on the partition of Sector 67/79, and near Balongi T-point.
 
 There are many other such spots on the roads in city where residents have been violating the rules which have more or less gone unchecked by the police.
