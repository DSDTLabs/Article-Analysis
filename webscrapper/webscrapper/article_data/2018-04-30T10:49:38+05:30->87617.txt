CHANDIGARH: With the government running out of space to store procured foodgrain, the   market committee in   district is using a cremation ground in a village for stocking wheat bought this season. Farmers from a cluster of 25 villages are forced to store their produce in the cremation ground adjacent to the procurement centre in Kathura village. 

 Gohana market committee officials said around 7,000 tonnes of wheat arrived at the Kathura procurement centre. A visit to the cremation ground reveals several tractor-trailers lined up and sacks of grains piled up at the site. Fearing damage to wheat due to rains, some of the farmers have stocked their produce in the sheds meant for the cremation of the bodies.
 
 “This is not a major issue. Since, cremation ground shares boundary with the procurement centre,   there. Also, I am relieved from that area and new officer is taking care of this issue,” said Savita Jain, secretary of market committee of Gohana.
 
 Swaroop Singh, a farmer from Kathura, dismissed her claim. “The government should have asked some farmers to offer their lands to facilitate the wheat growers. The only issue is money, which the government doesn’t want pay. We too feel bad but are helpless,” he said.
 
 Another farmer Satyawan said that the panchayat had offered five acres of land for setting up the procurement centre in Kathura. “But for the reasons best know to them, the mandi officials took just one acre adjacent to the cremation ground and the village pond. Farmers are at the risk of losing the produce during rains as the village pond overflows,” he added.
