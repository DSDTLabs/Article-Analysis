Surat: The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), apex body of the diamond and jewellery sector, made a presentation on GST (goods and service tax) issues and demanded export exemptions. The council has suggested a slew of exemptions and relief for the sector in the import of rough diamonds and coloured gemstones, exemption to all domestic transactions in rough as well as polished diamonds to name a few. 

 Chairman of GJEPC, Praveen Shanker Pandya, recently made a presentation on the GST issue at the conclave organized by Maharashtra government in the presence of Union finance minister Arun Jaitley. 
 
 The issues and suggestions made by the GJEPC on GST were focused on the export sector. The relief sought includes nil rating on import of rough diamonds and coloured gemstones, exemption to all domestic transactions in rough as well as polished diamonds and coloured gemstones prior to their exports, and exemption to precious metals procured for manufacture and export of jewellery, in terms of existing schemes.
 
 The GJEPC also made some key points including that the government reconsider whether taxes applicable in the export value chain should be neutralized through refund or exemption, reiterating tax rates under GST to be kept closer to the current tax rates, etc. 
 
 It has also made representation to the special committee on GST constituted for the purpose. “We have presented details regarding the unique nature of the gem and jewellery industry, and how specific aspects of its working means that imposing the refund mechanism could affect livelihoods of millions of workers,” said a GJEPC official.
