 and   are all set to tie the holy knot today at St. George’s Chapel. The happy couple has always stayed in the news for their charitable works and philanthropic moves. A few weeks ago, a spokesperson for the Kensington Palace reportedly announced that the couple had asked for donations to charity instead of wedding gifts, and had selected seven organisations as their preferred beneficiaries.

 While most of these are UK-based charities, but Mumbai's Govandi-based   too was in the list.  , a young 23-year-old woman who owns the trust revealed that it caught Meghan’s attention at an event in New York. Jalota, who was studying economics and global health at Duke University at the time, said that Meghan was intrigued by their work, and had said, then, that she wanted to make a trip to India as this was an area she wanted to lend her support to. 
 
 Jalota went on to profess that after she visited them in January last year, she said she wanted to position the organisation well so as to maximise the impact. The organisation aims at employing women who live in slums to run door-to-door awareness programmes about menstrual hygiene and women's health issues. Employment is also provided by training women to manufacture sanitary napkins, and the website claims that the foundation provides work-from-home opportunities too.
