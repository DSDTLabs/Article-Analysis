Pune: A 30-year-old man from Junnar was arrested late on Thursday night for allegedly creating a fake profile of senior BJP leader Girish   on social networking site Facebook and uploading obscene pictures on it. 

 The action was initiated after Bapat’s media adviser lodged a complaint with the cyber cell last month, leading to a first information report (FIR) against the suspect with the Bund Garden police on Thursday.
 
 Investigations by the cyber crime cell of the Pune police have revealed that the suspect, identified as Ruturaj Savkar Nalawade of Dholwad village in Junnar taluka, had created Bapat’s fake profile on Facebook in May.
 
 “Nalawade claims that he created the fake profile out of his affection for the leader. He also claims to have keen interest in politics with his wife, a school teacher, interested in contesting elections for graduates’ constituency,” Radhika Phadke, inspector of the cyber crime cell, said.
 
  Nalawade, who was arrested under section 500 (Punishment for defamation) of the Indian Penal Code and the section 66 (C) of the Information and Technology Act, was produced before a court on Friday and was released on bail. 
 
 Bapat’s media adviser Sunil Mane told TOI that Bapat already owns a profile on Facebook. “Last month, we found one more profile in the name of “Namdar Girish Bapat’. Some people even started following it believing it to be the Bapat’s new profile page,” he said.
 
 Mane said there were a few photographs of Bapat that were uploaded on the fake profile. “We were shocked to see some obscene pictures also tagged in the fake profile,” the media adviser said.
 
 Police are investigating if the suspect created fake profile of any other public figures on social networking sites.
