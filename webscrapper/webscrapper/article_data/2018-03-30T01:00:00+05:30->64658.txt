A social club of Kanpur recently hosted a ‘Sassy Spring’ theme party for its lady members. "We all are really excited about this get-together, as it has added some fun in our lives," said  , one of the key organisers of the party.
Going by the party theme, the venue was beautifully decorated with flowers. The members also chose to be dressed in floral western dresses so that they perfectly gel with the party theme. We spotted Rashmi, Sangeeta, Neha, Mona, Neeti, Monika, Geeta and Nisha having an entertaining time at the do.
