BARABANKI: A day after a suspected terrorist was shot down at Kakori in Lucknow,   police conducted mass combing in all the sensitive areas of the city. Hundreds of police personnel marched into the Deva   which sparked a rumor on social networking sites about a terrorist operation under way by the ATS but SP Barabanki later clarified that it was a routine checking drive.

 Personnel from six police stations along with two circle officers, ASP (north) conducted checking drives at all important hotels and shops and verified their identities. All landlords in the city who give rooms on rent have been given strict directions for submitting their verification at the nearest police station.
 
 Giving details of the operation, superintendent of police (Barabanki) Vaibhav Krishna told TOI that it was a routine drive in the aftermath of terrorist hideout in Lucknow. He also said we had conducted a survey of   shrine with the help of local state intelligent unit. “It happens to be a sensitive place as it is a major tourist attraction and many foreigners visit regularly,” said Krishna. Police teams were dispatched to all important markets, banks and ATMs of the city for checking.
 
 Akram, a local said at 5.30pm, huge police force suddenly entered our guest house located near   and started asking for the register of guests who were staying inside the house and for how long. “It scared us but police co-operated,” he told TOI.
