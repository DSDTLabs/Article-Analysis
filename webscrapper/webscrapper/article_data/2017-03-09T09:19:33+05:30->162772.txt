AHMEDABAD: The final board exams for class 12 students of   (CBSE) are set to begin from Thursday. The board exams for class 10 will begin a day later on Friday. The board had earlier decided to hold the exams with effect from March 1. However, due to the state elections in Uttar Pradesh, the dates were postponed by over a week. The exams for class 10 and 12 students will run up to April 10.

 For class 12 students, the physics paper will be on March 15, the one for Mathematics will be on March 20, Chemistry paper will be for March 25 while Biology will be on April 5. Similarly, for class 10 students, Hindi, Science, English, Maths and Social Studies exams will be held on March 10, 22, 30, and April 3 and April 8, respectively.
 
 This time around, 3,600 students are appearing for class 10 exams from Ahmedabad while 2,700 students will take the class 12 exams. Against this, 21,700 students will appear for the exams from class 10 while 13,600 students will take class 12 exams from across the state.
 
 The board exams will be conducted across 29 centres in the state. Generally, students don’t get their own schools allocated as their exam centres. Last year, around 20,000 students took class 10 board exams and 11,800 students took class 12 board exams from across the state. Well-placed sources said that surprise inspection is likely to be held in certain schools. Sources also confirmed that the final exams for other classes are complete across all the CBSE-affiliated schools in the state.
 
 While students are gearing up for the exams, even parents are ready for their kids’ board exams. In fact, some of them have adjusted their work timings or have even asked for leave. “My husband took leave in January so that our son, Varun, can be comfortable at home and study in a conducive atmosphere. I was to take leave earlier, but it did not get sanctioned. However, I have asked for a half working day for the first paper and March 13 onwards I would be on leave to take care of him at home,” said Geeta Nair, a resident of Gota, whose son will take the class 12 board exams on Thursday.
