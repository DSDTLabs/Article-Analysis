 had announced his directorial venture,  , with Vishal, Karthi and Sayyeshaa in lead roles a few days ago. Touted to be a romantic thriller, the film marks the dancing sensation’s return to direction after six years. Harris  , who had composed music for Prabhudheva’s Engeyum Kaadhal, has been roped in as the music director again. 

 Now, the grapevine has it that   will also be a part of the project. A source tells us, “Yes, Arya is likely to be in the cast though the details about his role are yet to be worked out.” When we contacted Arya, the actor said that he’s yet to get any intimation from the film’s crew. He says, “I haven’t received any information from the team. However, as this project is aimed at the benefit of Nadigar Sangam, I might be approached. I don’t know.” 
 It has to be noted that Arya was earlier supposed to play the baddie opposite Vishal in Irumbu Thirai, which didn’t materialise.
