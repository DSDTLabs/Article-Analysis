VIJAYAWADA: Hoping to see a book festival in Amaravati on par with the one in New York, former city mayor   urged the state government to spare at least 800 acres to  . He said the book exhibition could be turned into an international event, if the government allocates land in Amaravati. 

 Addressing a meeting of the book exhibition society here on Thursday, Sankar said reading helps develop culture. "One will read, only it he spends on buying a book. Books distributed for free are not taken seriously," said Sankar. He praised the book exhibition society for holding annual books festivals.
 
 He said mega book festivals like the ones held in developed cities like New York are possible because the state allocates enough land. Former chief secretary of undivided AP Mohan Kanda's book 'Trekking on the pebbles' was released at the function by district collector Babu Ahmed.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Babu recalled the beginning of his career as a trainee collector, under the leadership of Kanda. He said 'Trekking on the pebbles' would be a guide for young officers. Kanda said the book was released by vice-president Ansari in New Delhi and governor ESL Narasimhan in Hyderabad. He said the book was written using his personal experiences in public service.
 
 Book exhibition society president P Babjee, veteran journalist Valleswar, senior journalist K Ramachandra Murthy were also present.
