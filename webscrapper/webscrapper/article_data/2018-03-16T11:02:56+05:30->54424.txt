BAMBOLIM: A centralised   system with a capacity to wash 6,000 items a day was commissioned at   and Hospital ( ) on Thursday.

 Outsourced to   and Solutions, the facility will cater to government hospitals and health centres. Until now, only laundry from the district hospitals was sent to the GMC.
 
 Heath minister   told reporters the new facility would put an end to complaints of the lack of bed linen in the hospital.
 
 Managing director of Ecoclean, Roy Vas, said around 2,500 pieces of linen are presently being handled and that the system would run to its full capacity once laundry from other health centres started pouring in. “We will know the exact cost (of washing each item) may be two months after running the facility. We estimate the amount to be Rs 11 per item,” he said.
 
 The company is also likely to begin handing out equivalent amounts of fresh laundry to any hospital that brings its linen in, so that it need not wait till its own soiled items are cleaned.
 
 Although the company has begun discarding torn sheets, Vas said such sheets couldn’t be done away with completely until there is sufficient fresh stock. “An order has been placed for fresh linen,” he said.
 
 The Ecoclean MD also said nurses and other staff would soon be trained to ensure that blood-stained bedsheets and clothes are segregated before being sent to the laundry. “Linen is currently being segregated at the facility. Stained items that have stains should not be mixed with other laundry. They should first be dipped in a particular liquid before being washed or mixed with other laundry,” he said.
