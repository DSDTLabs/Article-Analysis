LUCKNOW: In a chilling reminder of the murder of a class II student in a Gurgaon school last year, a class I student was stabbed in his school toilet in Lucknow on Tuesday. The seven-year-old, who was allegedly attacked by a senior girl student, is battling for life at the trauma centre of King George’s   ( ).

 The incident happened at   school in Triveninagar on Tuesday but came to light only after the KGMU authorities revealed about it to the media. The school had informed the boy’s parents that he had met with an accident.
 
 The school officials informed the police in writing only after reporters reached the trauma centre. The district inspector of schools has issued a showcause notice to the school for not informing the police about the incident in time.
 
 The police are now questioning an 11-year-old class VI girl student of the same school.
 
 The victim, Hrithik Sharma, was stabbed in the chest and abdomen and locked inside the toilet by the girl. His cries were heard by teacher Amit Singh Chauhan, the designated discipline head, who found him in a pool of blood and his mouth stuffed with a cloth. He was rushed to a hospital, where doctors referred him to KGMU.
