AHMEDABAD:   consumers in Ahmedabad and Vadodara will now have shell out more for the gas they consume as   (AGL) has increased the prices of   (PNG) and   (CNG) for different segments including domestic, commercial and industrial.

 For residential (domestic) consumers, retail PNG price has been hiked by Rs 1.20 per standard cubic meter (SCM) to Rs 21.36 per SCM from Rs 20.16 per SCM (exclusive of all taxes). The company has raised CNG price by Rs 1.85/kg to Rs 47.80 per kg from Rs 45.95 per kg (inclusive of all taxes). These revised prices are effective from January 2, 2018. AGL serves about 240,000 households and approximately 150,000 CNG users in Ahmedabad and Vadodara.
 
 According to the company website, as far as commercial and industrial segments are concerned, AGL has increased PNG prices (with minimum guaranteed off-take) for industrial consumers to Rs 31.81 per SCM, while the rates have been hiked to Rs 45.17 per SCM for commercial customers. Both these rates are exclusive of all taxes and are effective from January 1, 2018.
 
 Last year, ahead of assembly elections AGL had raised the prices of CNG and PNG (domestic) in the month of October but rolled back the hike on its own. Several city gas distribution (CGD) companies have increased natural gas prices after the central governmentâ€™s move to raise domestic natural gas prices from October 1, 2017. In December, Gujarat Gas Limited (GGL), another CGD company, increased the prices of natural gas for industrial consumers.
