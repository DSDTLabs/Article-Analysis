KOLKATA: The I-League has been under scrutiny ever since the Indian Super League (ISL) was launched in 2014. There were heated debates at start of the current season over how things would pan out with the I-League and ISL being held simultaneously. There is still no clarity over the future of the country’s top football league next season. Yet, I-League has defied all expectations to throw up riveting contests, culminating in a grand finale that will see four teams vying for the title on the final day. It is an unprecedented scenario in the history of Indian football.

 
 
 
 The stakes are high and the permutations and combinations involving  ,  , Mohun Bagan and   all make for a 'Thrilling Thursday'. The three mouth-watering contests, which will kick-off at 3 pm simultaneously in Kolkata, Kozikhode and Panchkula, have caught the imagination of India’s football fanatics. Social media is abuzz with anticipation as supporters of the teams engage in a ‘virtual’ war of words ahead of the final round.
 
 No one, least of all the officials of the federation, would have dreamt of such an intriguing finish to the I-League that has been largely played under the shadow of the ISL. With most top Indian players preferring the ISL riches to club loyalty, the I-League became the last refuge for the country’s second string players - both Indian as well as foreigners. Ironically, I-League’s severe limitations have turned out to be a boon in disguise.
 
 The absence of top-notch Indian players meant the qualitative difference between the so-called Big Teams and other outfits was reduced to a minimal. East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, the perennial favourites in Indian club football, found their ‘exalted’ status strongly challenged by newbies. The quality of football has not always been top notch, but matches between evenly-matched sides produced keenly-contested games that have been lapped up by spectators, resulting in higher footfalls at stadiums.
 
 With four teams in contention, it promises to be a dramatic final day in the title race. Minerva FC are in pole position, but Neroca FC, Mohun Bagan or East Bengal can pip them.
 
 The possibilities for the contenders...
 
 
  
 
 
 
 • Irrespective of other results, Minerva will be champions if they beat Churchill. A win will take Minerva to 35 points — out of bounds for the other three — and relegate Churchill to the second division.
 
 • In case of a draw, Minerva will top the table, provided the other two matches also end indecisively. Minerva will then end with 33 pts, Neroca 32, East Bengal and Bagan 31 each.
 
 • In case of a loss, Minerva can still triumph, provided the other two matches are drawn. Then, Minerva and Neroca will end with 32 pts each (Minerva win on a better head-to-head) while Bagan and EB will tally 31 each.
 
 
 
 • For Neroca to take the title, they have to beat East Bengal and hope that Minerva Punjab will drop points against Churchill.
 
 
 
 • Mohun Bagan will be champions if they beat Gokulam Kerala FC and hope that Minerva lose and Neroca drop points.
 
 • Bagan can also claim victory if Minerva draw with Churchill and both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan win. Three teams will then finish with 33 points each. Bagan will top as rules state that the winner will be decided by maximum number of points obtained in matches among the teams concerned. Bagan will then have 7 points from 4 matches (1-1 & 1-2 vs Minerva; 1-0 & 2-0 vs East Bengal), Minerva 5 points (1-1 & 2-1 vs Bagan; 2-2 & 0-1 vs East Bengal) and East Bengal 4 points (0-1 & 0-2 vs Bagan; 2-2 & 1-0 vs Minerva).
 
 
 
 • Destiny is no longer in East Bengal’s hands.
 
 They can only take the title if they beat Neroca at home and both Minerva and Mohun Bagan drop points.
