 "Courteney says she can't stand being apart from Johnny so much and the long distance has been causing some tense rows. " "While she can't move to the UK permanently because of Coco, she's vowed to compromise and spend much more time here. She's currently taking a work break and he's so busy with the studio, which makes it almost impossible for him to leave," a source said.
