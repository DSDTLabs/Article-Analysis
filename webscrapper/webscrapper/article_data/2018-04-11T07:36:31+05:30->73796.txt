LUCKNOW: Commuters often avoid crossing railway underpasses in the city when trains pass through them. This is done to escape filth that trickles down from the railway tacks and train toilets. 

 Moreover, as commuters wiat for the trains to pass, it leads to traffic jams near the underpasses. 
 
 After mayor Sanyukta Bhatia raised this issue with DRM   Satish Kumar, railways has decided to fix the problem by covering the underpasses with   soon. Kumar said the roof of   underpasses has been covered with iron sheet and the same would be done on other underpasses as well. The main railways underpasses in the city are Mawaiya, Daliganj, Hathi Park and Aishbagh. 
 
 But the   says that iron sheets are not helpful in checking filth because they get rusted soon and cannot stop trickling of liquid flow through the roofs.   has asked the NR to instead use turf sheets (a kind of plastic) which can easily be moulded as per the shape of the roof. 
 
 Mayor said, "The turf sheets can be moulded into drain like structure on sides of the underpass so that any filth can trickle down the sides and flow into the drains of roads below. This will prevent the filth falling from the roofs." DRM North-Eastern Railway Vijay Lakshmi Kaushik said if iron sheets are effective then they will be used in NER underpasses too.
