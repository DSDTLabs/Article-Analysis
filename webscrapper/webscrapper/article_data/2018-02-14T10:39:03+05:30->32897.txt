JAIPUR: The   of up to Rs 50,000 announced by chief minister   in the last Budget of her current term failed to satisfy farmer leaders who said on Tuesday they would continue with their proposed agitation.

 All India Kisan Sabha national president and former CPI (M) MLA Amraram said that the farm loan waiver was only partial and that they would “go ahead with their agitation on February 22 to gherao the assembly”.
 
 
 The government actually agreed to waive loans after the Kisan Sabha had launched an agitation in Sikar last year.
 
 He said padyatras had kicked off from Jhunjhunu and Kota and these would culminate in the state capital on February 22 after covering major parts of the state.
 
 Amraram said the Budget only considered loans given to farmers by cooperative banks but farmers’ loans from other banks, private and public, also needed to be considered.
 
 The government seems to be working to break farmers’ unity by dividing them into various categories, like small, marginal, and others, Amaram said, adding the relief announced was only for a small fraction of them.
 
 The Budget announcement spoke of “a one-time loan waiver of Rs 50,000 for small and marginal farmers in the overdue and outstanding category of short-term crop loans provided by cooperative banks”.
 
 The Budget has also proposed a permanent mechanism to address farmers’ debt by constituting a “Rajasthan State Farmers Debt Relief Commission” along the lines of the Kerala model.
 
 “The commission would consider petitions by debt-ridden farmers to recommend genuine cases needing relief to the government. So this is part of a continuous process to provide relief to famers,” said a government official.
 
 Amraram said, “Our demand was for agriculture loans of all farmers. This kind of piecemeal approach will not address the agrarian crisis and farmer suicides,” he told TOI over the phone.
