Amritsar: Alleging that the ruling SAD had asked its supporters to vote for Congress to damage AAP’s chances, SGPC former general secretary Sukhdev Singh Bhaur and former member Jaswinder Singh Advocate have appealed to voters in Punjab to “vote with their conscience”.

 The duo had joined AAP recently. Talking to TOI on Friday, Jaswinder said, “We left SAD only after party leaders cornered Panthic principles for personal gains. Congress can’t be an alternative party for any Sikh since it ordered the Army to storm the Golden Temple. AAP has shown a ray of hope, so why not support and vote for the party?”
 
 He claimed that fearing defeat, Akali leaders were asking voters to vote for the Congress only to prevent AAP from coming to power. SADs Amritsar district (urban ) president, Gurpartap Singh, denied the allegations. “They are trying to mislead gullible Sikhs for electoral gains. I appeal to the masses to not give ear to such statements,” he said.
 
 Saying that he had always stood by Panthic principles, Bhaur said, “I appeal to the people of Punjab — be it labourers, businessmen, farmers or working class families — who have been voting for Akalis in the past to be careful about their last-minute, political conspiracies and make a change in the state.”
 
 Bhaur and Jaswinder said they had been Akalis, but when party leaders didn’t listen to them and kept on violating ‘maryada’ (traditions), they had to think of other ways to bring about a change.
 
 Jaswinder claimed that with Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda extending support to SAD-BJP, he held a series of meetings and came to know that its followers were largely divided over the “edict”. “For all these years, dera followers were targeted by Akalis who left no opportunity to demean them. And now, all of a sudden they were asked to vote for Akalis,” Jaswinder said.
