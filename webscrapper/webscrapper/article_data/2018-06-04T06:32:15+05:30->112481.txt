HYDERABAD: Around 10 houses have been razed in   in   ward of GHMC to build homes under the Telangana government’s  .

 
 An affected family was seen crying for help when authorities bulldozed their house on Sunday. Sitting near demolished walls, amid scattered household items, family members ran towards approaching politicians and the media in the hope that they would help.
 
 The families whose houses were razed alleged that authorities had not given prior notice and barged into their homes with revenue officials and cops.
 
 “Around 30 cops along with women police personnel were deployed to vacate our house. At the end, it was not the cops, but revenue officials who barged in and misbehaved with us,” said T Venkatesham, 66, owner of one of the houses.
 
 T Shamanta, Venkatesham’s wife, said that they had purchased the house for Rs 30 lakh. The family makes ends meet by selling milk.
 
 “We mortgaged gold, took loans and purchased the house. Now we don’t know where to go. Even if we rent out a home our source of earning has also been snatched. Authorities razed the room attached to our home where we sell milk,” said Shamanta.
 
 Former MLA of the area (LB Nagar constituency ) D  , who has also worked as   (HUDA) chairman, was spotted near the demolition site. He alleged that when he took the affected persons to the collector of Medchal, M V Reddy, the latter misbehaved with him and turned a blind eye towards people’s grievances. “I took people whose houses were razed to the collector. Instead of solving their grievance he was rude to me,” he said.
 
 Another resident  , whose house was demolished, also expresses anger over the demolition.
 
 Revenue department officials did not respond to calls when 
  contacted them. Ginnaram Vittal Reddy, GHMC corporator of Chaitaynapuri ward, said documents of the house razed on Sunday were not completely genuine. “The government is trying to accommodate 66 families here,” he said.
