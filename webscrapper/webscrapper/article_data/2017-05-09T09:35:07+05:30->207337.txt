WEST MIDNAPORE
 Seldom would you hear of a fairy-tale end to a love story- inside a rescue centre. An eventuality of the kind would call for much celebration. And it did as one such rare marriage was made in the worldly settings of   here on Monday .

 The bride is 19-year-old Rani Murao, who had fled her Uttar Pradesh home and rescued by the GRP at   in 2009. The groom is Mahendra Bhaskar (25) from Behrampore, Murshidabad. The two tied the knot in the sweltering summer afternoon, with officials of   Balika Bhavan and the local panchayat participating enthusiastically .
 
  struck a few years ago when Rani was living in a government home in Nadia. Mahendra, who works in a courier firm, would come to deliver letters. "I fell in love with Rani and told my parents that if I were to marry ever, it would have to be her," Mahendra said. But Rani was shifted to Vidyasagar Balika Bhavan in West Midnapore in 2012. "Since my son would only marry Rani, we contacted the home officials. Talks were on for the last one year, and finally the marriage is taking place," Rani's father-in-law Mahadeb said.
 
 Draped in Banarasi, Rani, who had fled home when her father remarried and sent her to her aunt, said, "I want to start a new life." Additional DM (panchayat)   gave the bride away (kanyadaan), while West Midnapore zilla parishad sabhadhipati Uttara Singha Hazra supervised the same. Susthiti Tewari, superintendent of Vidyasagar Balika Bhavan, said, "Rani has studied till Class-VIII and trained in nursing. We are trying to get her a nurse's job in Murshidabad."
