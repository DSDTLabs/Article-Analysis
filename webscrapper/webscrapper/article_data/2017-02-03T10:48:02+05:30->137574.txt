SURAT: Two female leopard cubs were found dead on the river bed near   town of Tapi district on Wednesday. The post mortem revealed that the cubs, which were around one year old, died of natural causes as no sign of injury or poisoning was found. The cubs are suspected to have died three days ago. 

 “The cubs could have died for want of enough food,” said Puneet Nayyar, deputy conservator of forest, Surat. Forest officials believe the cubs might have separated from their mother recently and starved to death. In recent past, bodies of young leopards have been found from Surat, Navsari and   districts. In some cases, injury marks were found on bodies but forest officials couldn’t find out exact cause of their deaths
 
 Meanwhile, forest officials suspect a female leopard found dead near Valod on Monday was the mother of these two cubs. She had died of pneumonia and head injury.
