CHENNAI:   inflow into the city has stopped, as the water level in the Kandaleru reservoir in Andhra Pradesh has dropped drastically.

 The city will have to fend for itself by extracting water from alternate sources such as farm wells and abandoned quarry sites identified by Metrowater.
 
 The city has got nearly 3 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) of water since January after former chief minister   requested his Andhra Pradesh counterpart to release water from the Kandaleru reservoir to meet the city's drinking needs after a failed northeast monsoon.
 
 Krishna water had been flowing into the Poondi reservoir at the rate of 400 cusecs (11,200 litres per second) in February and dropped to 100 cusecs (2800 litres per second) in March first week.On Wednesday, the rate of flow dropped to 4 cusecs (112 litres per second).
 
 The four city reservoirs now hold just 1.4 TMC, a me re 13% of their capacity, compared to 65% last year.The current storage in the reservoirs is likely to last until April, when loss due to evaporation is accounted.
 
 A public works department (PWD) engineer at Poondi said, “As the level Kandaleru has dropped, Andhra Pradesh has stopped Krishna water supply.“
 
 As the reservoirs approach dead storage with the approaching summer, Metrowater plans to extract water from farm wells in Tiruvallur, Neyveli basin, Paravanor and   and bring it to the city through the Veeranam pipeline.
 
 Additionally, water from city lakes and quarry sites will be tapped to ensure the regular supply of 550 million litres a day.
