Mumbai: Repair work and overall poor   conditions on LBS Marg in Bhandup inconvenienced students on their way to their   exam centres on Tuesday. Students complained that some of them required over an hour to cover a distance that otherwise takes only 10 minutes.

 Karuna Shah, a student whose centre was at Bright High School in Bhandup, reached the centre only a few minutes before 11 am. 
 
 “It is a distance which requires about 15 minutes by foot but as it was her exam she decided to take a rickshaw and it took an hour. By the time she found her exam hall and seat, she had missed about 10 mintues of the exam,” said a relative.
