NEW DELHI: That   and   are a great middle-order association should need no reiterating, but for those who may have forgotten what the two World Cup winners can conjure when batting together in ODIs, Thursday’s second match was a surreal example. 

 The pair scored centuries - Yuvraj for the first time since 2011, Dhoni since 2013 - while reviving India from 25/3 to 281/4 in the second ODI against England in Cuttack, thus paving the way for victory that gave Virat Kohli’s team an unassailable 2-0 lead with a match to go. This rollocking stand of 256 in 38.2 overs helped India make 381/6 and put Dhoni and Yuvraj as India’s seventh most prolific batting pair in ODIs, with a total of 3051 runs in 64 innings at an average of 53.52, with 10 century stands. 
 
 Following their excellent revival act at the Barabati Stadium, here’s a recap of their most important partnerships in ODI wins. 
 
 
 
 
 Game six of the Videocon Triangular Series in Harare saw India chase 251 from the depths of 91/5 thanks to a century from Yuvraj (120 off 124 balls) and Dhoni’s unbeaten 67 off 83 balls. This was only the fourth time they were batting together, and their time together produced a second successive century stand. The pair added 158 in 140 balls to put India on course for victory, pacing themselves well before the definitive late burst. An alliance that would win India many matches was up and running. 
 
 
 
 
 In the third match of their tour of Pakistan, India were chasing 289 to take a lead in the series. Sachin Tendulkar (95) and Mohammad Kaif (0) had just been dismissed in succession and Yuvraj, batting on 53 from 54 balls, needed support with the bowlers to follow. Shoring up a chunk of the pressure, Dhoni punched fours and ran doubles to keep up with an asking rate of 6.50, which soon lessened with his pugnacious innings. In the time it took Yuvraj to move from 53 to 79, Dhoni clattered 13 fours in his 46-ball unbeaten 72. That was, according to Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, the turning point in the chase. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 Rahul Dravid’s team had wrapped up the series by the time that fifth ODI began at Karachi’s iconic National Stadium, but there was one more Yuvraj-Dhoni special to wow the spectators (which included Pakistan’s Prime Minister, General Parvez Musharraf). The target for India was 287, and they were 141/2 in the 31st over when Dhoni strode out at No 4 to join Yuvraj, batting on 46 from 50 deliveries. What played out was another excellent association between the two batsmen, with Pakistan’s bowlers left clueless. Runs flowed at 8.84 an over and India won by eight wickets with 19 deliveries remaining. Yuvraj ended on 107 off 93 balls, Dhoni on 77 off 56, having clubbed six fours and four sixes. This was India’s 13th successive ODI run chase in victory, putting them within a game of equaling the record set by West Indies in the 1980s. 
 
 
 
 
 This five-ODI series began with India beating Pakistan by five wickets with three overs remaining, thanks in no small part to good work from the captain and vice-captain in the middle order. From 113/3 the pair took the score to 218/4 before Yuvraj mistimed a slog-sweep and was caught for 58. Moments later, Dhoni fell for 63 off 77 balls, but there were no further hiccups. 
 
 
 
 
 Two matches later, the reliable duo was back in business - this time when India were batting first - to pile on pain for Pakistan once again. Shoaib Malik’s team had hit back in the game to pull India back from 82/1 to 129/3 after 28 overs, only for Yuvraj and Dhoni to score their runs at 6.59 per over. Dhoni made 49 off 52 balls to Yuvraj’s 39 during this stand, which was the pair’s fourth century alliance against Pakistan in seven innings. Yuvraj hung on longer to score 77 from 95 balls, a knock which, coupled with a run out and the wicket of Malik later on, fetched him the Man-of-the-Match award. 
 
 
 
 
 In the third ODI of this best-of-seven series, with the scores locked at 1-1, Dhoni and Yuvraj forged the alliance that won India the game. Chasing 230, the home team went from 37 without loss to 53/3 with the wickets of Virender Sehwag, Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir. Just 16 runs had been scored in 6.4 overs as these wickets fell. Australia’s next success came at 201/4 once Yuvraj had made 78 off 96 balls and put India 29 runs away from victory with six overs in hand. This was, once again, a partnership based on smart running between the wickets and both players’ abilities to hit the bad balls for boundaries. Thanks to Yuvraj and Dhoni’s mastery at stealing sharp singles and converting ones into twos, the asking rate was never a concern. Yuvraj fell before the finish line, but Dhoni completed the job with 71 off 95 deliveries. 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 After the pain of 1996, the heartbreak of 2003 and the humiliation of 2007, India surged to their second World Cup title success on the back of Gambhir's knock and his alliance with Dhoni which shut Sri Lanka out of the contest after they had reduced the favourites to 114/3 chasing 275. But it was fitting that the pair to finish a historic chase were the successful pair of Yuvraj and Dhoni. 
 
 Dhoni had walked in ahead of Yuvraj once India lost Kohli for 35 at 114/3, and found himself joined by his favorite partner following Gambhir’s exit for a superb 97. After Gambhir departed, Dhoni cut six over backward point and despite a few nervy moments between the wickets with Yuvraj the end came rather comfortably amid a flurry of boundaries from Dhoni. The winning hit came via a monstrous six, cuing absolute pandemonium in the ground, and Yuvraj (21* off 24 balls) embraced his captain in a moment that will remain indelible from Indian cricket history.
