NEW DELHI:   chief minister Virbhadra Singh has been given a week’s time by the Enforcement Directorate to appear before investigating officers after he failed to come for the recording of his statement on Thursday at the agency’s headquarters in Delhi.

 Singh along with his wife and son have been facing a money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). A preliminary investigation has been completed and the agency has already questioned his son and wife earlier in the case.
 
 In a fresh summon, the ED has asked the Himachal CM to appear for questioning on April 20. A money laundering probe was initiated against Singh after the   had filed a disproportionate assets case against him and his family members in 2015. The CBI has recently filed a chargesheet against them.
 
 Earlier this month, ED had attached a Delhi farmhouse worth over Rs 27 crore owned by the family members of Singh. This was the second attachment order after a similar provisional attachment of properties belonging to Singh and family members worth over Rs 8 crore in Delhi and at other places last year.
 
 Singh has denied all charges and called the ED and CBI actions as politically motivated. The issue found mention in Parliament on Monday last when the Upper House was briefly adjourned after Congress alleged that the government was unleashing the ED and CBI to target chief ministers of opposition ruled states.
