BHUBANESWAR:   on Tuesday moved the Election Commission of India ( ) seeking disqualification of   chief minister and   president   as an MLA. 

 The saffron party also demanded that Naveen be barred from contesting elections for three years for submitting wrong poll expenditure accounts to the EC.
 
 In a memorandum submitted to chief electoral officer D N Gupta, BJP said Naveen failed to provide the correct information on his election expenses while contesting as an MLA from Hinjili, in Ganjam district, in 2014. 
 
 “Naveen’s statement said he received Rs 13.10 lakh through RTGS... towards poll expenses. The BJD’s statment... said the party paid Rs 16.48 lakh to Naveen by two separate cheques in March and June that year,” BJP state vice-president S Mohanty said. 
 
 BJD dismissed BJP’s allegations and said the saffron outfit is trying to mislead people. 
 
 The Orissa high court is likely to decide on a plea filed by Prem Chand Choudhury, district election officer, on the issue of Naveen’s expenses, on Thursday.
