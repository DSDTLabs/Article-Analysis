 She said, 'We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It is important for me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty, so that they can grow up in a world where they look into a mirror, first to their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House and the Grammys. And see themselves with no doubt that they are beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race. And I feel that it is vital that we learn from the past and recognize opportunities to learn from our mistakes. Thank you again for honouring 'Lemonade'.'
