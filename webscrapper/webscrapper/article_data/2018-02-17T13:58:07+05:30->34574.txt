Coimbatore: Two new police stations, to be inaugurated at Sulthanpet and   next week, are expected not only to lessen burden on the existing stations but also help the police in enforcement of law and order. Sixty police personnel will be appointed at the stations.

 “We have identified private buildings in Sulthanpet and Thadagam to open the new stations and have selected 60 police personnel. The new facilities will function as circle police stations under sub-inspectors,” superintendent of police   told TOI.
 
 “Thadagam village falls under the Thudiyalur police station limit and the station covers more than 30km area. People from tribal settlements at Thoomanur, Sembukkarai and Anaikatti are forced to travel at least 30km to reach Thudiyalur to lodge complaints. Also, police personnel have to travel for long distances for investigation. The Thadagam station will cover Anaikatti and a few tribal settlements and make it easy for people to approach us,” Moorthy said.
 
 Chief minister   had announced about opening the stations in the assembly a few months ago. As the government has not yet provided the required staff for the new facilities, 60 officers working in rural police stations have been deputed to work there.
 
 “A batch of police personnel, who are undergoing training, will be appointed at the new facilities after they complete the training,” said Moorthy.
 
 Municipal administration minister SP Velumani, Sulur AIADMK MLA Kanagaraj and Kavundampalayam MLA VC Arukutty are expected to open the new facilities. 
 
 The Coimbatore rural police have 33 police stations. A new one, exclusively for maintaining traffic, was opened in Pollachi recently.
