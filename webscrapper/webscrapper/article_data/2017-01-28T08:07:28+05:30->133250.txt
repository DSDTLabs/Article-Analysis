KOLKATA: The owner and an employee of an eatery at   were   for   on a   following a dispute. 

 After their routine morning walk, the group of 12 stopped at Sharma Tea at CF Block and ordered tea when a man, selling idli in a cart, approached. Some from the group bought idli from him and started to have it, sitting on the tea stall’s chairs. Seeing the crowd around the food cart, the eatery owner raised an objection and told the vendor to move away. As an argument broke out, an employee of Sharma’s Tea Stall pushed the food cart, which escalated the fight, with him allegedly snatching the vendor’s containers.
 
 When the morning-walkers raised an objection, the employee threw   at them. “The oil fell on some of us, scalding us. Three of us sustained severe injuries on the neck and back and had to be taken to hospital,” Salt Lake BD Block resident Vinay Dubey mentioned in the police complaint.
 
 Following the attack, more people gathered near the shop, broke the glass panes and had a scuffle with the employees till the police reached the spot.
 
 Based on the morning-walkers’ complaint at the Bidhannagar North police station, shop owner Prakash Jalan and waiter Bhola Kumar were arrested in the afternoon for causing grievous hurt and causing grievous hurt by dangerous means or weapons. If found guilty, they could be in jail for up to 10 years.
 
 TOI found the shop operating as usual in Friday. “There was a miscommunication between customers and our employees and we are sorry for what happened. We have sorted out the matter and we don’t want to discuss it,” said one of the owners.
