BENGALURU: The recent statement by law minister   that the intake of   causing   among the   has raised an alarm. Questions have been raised whether the polished rice, which reportedly lacks nutrients, supplied through the public distribution system to BPL families in the state is edible at all. However, food and civil supplies minister   defended the scheme and said the reports by private medical institutes cannot be considered as a final verdict. 

 
 
 
 I don’t think the law minister meant to say the rice supplied under the Anna Bhagya scheme was faulty. He may have only meant that the government is trying to balance the diet of people by adding tur dal under the scheme.
 
 
 
 
 No. But I will be speaking to the law minister in this regard and cross-check the matter.
 
 
 
 
 The rice is provided to us by the central government via the Food Corporation of India (FCI). Till now, all reports suggest that people are healthy and fine.
 
 
 
 
 We cannot take all reports by private medical institutes at face value. We have to also look at under what context they have prepared the reports. Today, one report may suggest that the rice is good and the next day, another may say it’s bad for health. Some doctors claim wheat is good for diabetes, others say rice is better. So who will you believe? The reports must be authentic.
 
 
 
 
 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an individual must consume foods like rice that are rich in carbohydrates to the tune of 14 kg per month. We are providing half of that which is 7 kg per month. We cannot reduce it further. Moreover, we are balancing the diet as per the staple foodgrain in each region like jowar in north Karnataka and ragi in southern parts of the state.
