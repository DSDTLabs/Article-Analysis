Mangaluru: Crab meat ghee roast, pomfret butter fry, steamed pomfret, tava pomfret, seer pepper, lady fish masala fry, steamed prawns… These dishes are on the menu for AICC president Rahul Gandhi’s dinner on Tuesday night.

 Rahul loves his fish which is why an array of sea-food specialties has been lined up when he visits the city. The menu includes local specialties and some delicacies from Kerala. Rahul will have about 35 VVIPs accompanying him.
 
 Keeping in mind his love for local cuisine, local leaders have zeroed in on a non-descript, but popular fish eatery in the Bendooe area. Although the caterer has been sounded out, the location is still undecided. The food will be prepared by the popular, Fish Market, a sea food restaurant tucked into a corner of a residential area in Bendoor. The joint, owned Ismail Ullal, who lives broad, is managed by Zakaria Ahmed, Mohammed Rafiq and Mohammed Haneef. The menu was decided from Delhi.
 
 Zakaria confirmed they had received a call from RG’s office a week ago and finalized the menu. “We will supply the food, but whether Rahul will have food here or elsewhere is not known,” he said.
 
 The area, with narrow bylanes and several residential buildings, is a security nightmare. The SPG has been scouting the place for the past two days and is likely to thumb down the location. It is likely to ask for the food to be supplied at another location.
 
 So what makes this restaurant popular? Perhaps word of mouth, says the management. “We serve fresh food. We do not marinate fish in advance. Only after a customer makes his choice, will we start cooking,” says Zakaria.
