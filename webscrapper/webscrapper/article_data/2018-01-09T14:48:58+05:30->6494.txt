The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( ) asked the state association of Baroda not to pick former Indian international   for the recently concluded Ranji Trophy season, after the allrounder was tested positive for a banned substance Terbutaline during the tournament last year. 

 According to a report published in a leading daily, Pathan, who played just one Ranji Trophy game for Baroda last season, “consumed a medicine named Brozeet which has Terbutaline in it. While Terbutaline is a banned substance, a player is allowed to take it if he has taken prior permission, neither Pathan nor the team doctor took prior permission,” says the report. 
 
 The report further adds that after the test returned positive, BCCI asked Baroda not to pick Pathan for the reminder of the tournament. Pathan has not played any form of cricket since October last year. Pathan is now the second Indian cricketer to be tested positive after Delhi bowler Pradeep Sangwan was handed an 18-month ban after he was tested positive for banned substances during 2012 IPL.
 
 Interestingly, BCCI has been under pressure from Indian government's anti-doping watchdog, National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada) to conduct the tests on Indian cricketers, but the board had made it clear that it will not budge from its anti-doping policies and will not allow   to conduct the tests on Indian cricketers. 
 
 In November last year, BCCI CEO,  , in a letter sent to World Anti-Doping Agency ( ), Nada and the sports secretary Rahul Bhatnagar on November 8, pointed out the technical points which suggest Nada has no jurisdiction over Indian cricketers. Johri made it clear that there is no requirement for Nada to tests its cricketers because the board is not a National Sports Federation (NSF). He insisted that its present anti-doping system is robust enough. Johri also cited that BCCI's response has been framed under the instructions of Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA).
