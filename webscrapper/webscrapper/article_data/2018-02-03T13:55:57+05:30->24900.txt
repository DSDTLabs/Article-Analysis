BHOPAL: The   (SAI), Bhopal on Friday stopped around a dozen athletes from training on charges of misconduct. While SAI officials alleged misconduct, the athletes retorted saying that the officials were autocratic. 

 Around 10-12 athletes have raised red flag against the management after they were stopped from training. Incidentally, majority of them are the national athletes. Athletes alleged that   is making its own rules. "Nowhere in the country day-boarders are stopped from taking part in training. Officials in Bhopal are making their own rule," said an athlete, who was stopped from training.
 
 Sources said these athletes were thrown out of the hostel on the grounds of indiscipline and misconduct. "It is nothing but to save the athletics coaches. There are different rules for athletes and coaches. We only want to continue our training," said an athlete. Athletes also alleged that the coaches were creating trouble for them. "Athletics coach Nimai Bose and his team have been troubling athletes," they said.
 
 They said that even roaming with a female athlete on the campus is a problem for the officials. "Is it indiscipline? But, officials sent athletes out of the campus for this reason," said an athlete.
 
 When contacted, assistant director, Pratapendra Ray told TOI that athletes were lying. "Despite several incidents of misconduct on part of the athletes, they were allowed to continue. But, these athletes went on committing such mistakes, which is unpardonable," said Ray.
 
  He, however, said that SAI has given them forms to fill if they want to resume their training. "None of them wants to fill it as they know that their mistake would be caught. We have been following rules and regulations under which these athletes were found not fit so they were asked to move out. If they fill the forms given to them with proper details they can be allowed to start training," said Ray. Athletes said they would fill the form as nothing wrong is done on their part.
