CHANDIGARH: Haryana police have arrested the daughter-in-law and domestic help of the 80-year-old woman who was found brutally murdered in   
 . The accused  , 33, and  , 36, confessed to killing the victim to cover up their illicit relationship.

 The two had inserted a plastic bottle of a toilet cleaner into the victim’s anal cavity and let her bleed to death. The brutality had shocked doctors who performed the post-mortem, as it reminded them of the infamous Nirbhaya case of December 2012.
 
 Police said forensic experts had suspected the role of family member, as there had been no forced entry into the house on the day of the crime.
 
 Some neighbours told police that Satwanti and Mandal, who were suspected to be in a relationship, could possibly be the murderers. During police interrogation, the suspects confessed to have killed the victim 
  night. The body was recovered in blood-soaked quilts 
  morning.
 
 “
 , the victim found him getting intimate with Satwanti, and threatened to tell her son everything, following which, the duo murdered her,” said investigating officer  .
 
 Initially, they tried to strangulate her, but when that didn’t help, Satwanti gave Mandal the plastic bottle who forcibly inserted it into her private part, Singh added. The family had employed Mandal two years ago to milk the cattle and tend the farm.
