LUCKNOW: A woman was arrested on Friday from Ujariyaon in Gomtinagar on charges of stealing and kidnapping a newborn baby from Mahila Bal Chikitsalaya in Indiranagar on Wednesday. 

 After arrest, Aarti was produced before mediapersons but she did not reply to queries and kept crying. ASP (trans-Gomti) Durgesh Kumar said Aarti had confessed during her interrogation that her family was very upset with her for not having had children despite being married for five years. Six months ago, doctors told her that she could never bear children due to some medical complication. Since her family continued to pester her, Aarti decided to steal a baby. 
 
 On Wednesday, Aarti called her husband Lavkush, a painter by profession, who was out for work and told him that she was pregnant and will get herself admitted on her own in the hospital. Lavkush told police that he did not believe Aarti and thought that she was acting odd due to mental stress caused by childlessness. However, Aarti went to   in Indiranagar and picked up a baby from the ward for newborns. She put the baby in a basket and took an auto for Polytechnique crossing from where she informed her husband that she had delivered a baby and was going home. 
 
 The husband also rushed home. He told police that he did not believe Aarti, but was in two minds whether to keep the child or report to the police. On Thursday evening, Ghazipur inspector   said an informer told them about the development in Lavkushâ€™s family. Cops traced the house and recovered the child.
