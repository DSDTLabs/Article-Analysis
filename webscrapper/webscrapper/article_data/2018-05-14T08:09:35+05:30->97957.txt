HYDERABAD: Hyderabad continues to drive recklessly with traffic violations such as overspeeding, triple riding and   jumping still rampant within city limits.

 In this year alone, till April 27, traffic police have booked a total of 78,615 vehicles for speeding, 17,689 vehicles for triple riding and 6,060 for signal jumping. Meanwhile, 3,340 cases of dangerous driving and 730 cases of reckless driving have been booked this year as well.
 
 Road safety experts point to the lack of discipline among commuters as the primary reason for the high number of road mishaps recorded every year.
 
 “Even after the penalty point system was introduced, the number of traffic violators is not dipping. Despite many driving licenses being suspended for various traffic offences this year, rules are being flouted rampantly as awareness level among commuters continues to be low. Signal jumping and wrong-side driving are all practices that can endanger the lives of the driver as well as others on the road,” said  , CEO of the Indian Federation of Road Safety (IFROS).
 
 Commuters meanwhile identified traffic violations as a major cause of worsening traffic snarls and congestion in the city. Till April 27 of this year, 3,125 vehicles have been booked for violating the oneway rule while 1,945 have been booked for obstruction of ‘free left’ at junctions. 575 people have also been booked for ‘disobeying’ the traffic signal. Data available with traffic cops shows how cases pertaining to ‘obstruction of free left’ at traffic signals grew by 124.4 % in 2017, when compared with the previous year.
 
 “Signal jumping, obstruction of free left and wrong-side driving are very rampant in parts of Hyderabad. Such offences create a nuisance for other road users and it also holds up the traffic,” said   S, a commuter.
