PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   has demanded that the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation ( ) should first seek permission from the state irrigation department to draw water from the Bhama Askhed and Andra dams before it starts work on laying of pipelines from the two dams and other civil projects. 

 Yogesh Babar, recently appointed the president of the Shiv Sena’s Pimpri Chinchwad unit, told reporters on Wednesday that he has sent a letter to municipal chief   asking him to reduce leakage of water from the current 38% to 15% as per government norms and a scheme be prepared for equitable distribution of water.
 
 Babar has pointed out in the letter that 337.5 million litres a day (MLD) water is needed for a population of 25 lakh in Pimpri Chinchwad at the rate of 135 litres per person per day, but the civic body draws 520 MLD water from the Pavana dam. Moreover, there is a lot of uncertainty over drawing more water from the two dams.
 
 Earlier, the   had purchased pipelines worth Rs 200 crore and then tried to acquire land from farmers to lay a pipeline from the Pavana dam to Nigdi. The project was stalled later and the expenditure has now gone waste. 
 
 Sena corporators had demanded that the Nationalist   should pay the stipulated amount to the irrigation department to draw water from Bhama Askhed and Andra dams, but the   failed to do so. 
 
 Now, the civic body will have to pay Rs 230 crore for getting an allocation of 300 million litres of water a day from these two dams.
 
 Babar’s letter states that the civic administration must not misuse any public money by purchasing pipelines, allotting contracts for construction of water tanks and other civil works before it receives proper permission from the necessary authorities to lift water from the two dams.
