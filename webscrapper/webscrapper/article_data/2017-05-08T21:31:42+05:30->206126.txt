Bhopal: Harsh sun and hot winds coupled with clouds in the afternoon turned the City of Lakes into an oven on Sunday making it the hottest day of the season as temperature rose to 43.3 degrees Celsius. What’s more, the temperature is likely to touch the 44 degrees mark in the city soon according to Met officials.

 The day temperature recorded in Bhopal on Sunday was a searing 2 degrees above the normal mark. Before this, the highest temperature in the city was recorded on April 17 at 42.7 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature, too, remained two degrees higher than normal at 26.7 degrees, which means the night was uncomfortable too. Hot winds blew all day.
 
 The evening brought little rain and dust storms in the city that offered no respite from the dry hot weather.
 
 According to the Met department, Bhopal circle the rise in temperature is due to the weakening of various systems over the state. The trough line and upper air cyclonic circulation over the central parts of Madhya Pradesh has weakened — resulting in less clouds which is leading to an increase in the mercury levels.
 
 A similar trend was observed in the cities across the state. Khajuraho recorded the highest temperature in Madhya Pradesh at 45.6 degree Celsius, Gwalior was close behind at 45.5 degree Celsius.
 
 In the forecast for Bhopal on Monday the sky will be clear with some chances of clouds and thunder storms in the evening. Average wind speed would be around 14 to 16 kmph and day and night temperatures will be 43 and 27 degree Celsius respectively.
 
 For the state, the weatherman predicts a likely chance of light rain or thunder shower at isolated areas over Jabalpur, Hoshangabad, Raisen, Sehore, Khargone, Khandwa, Burhanpur, Dindori, Anuppur, Neemuch and Mandsaur. The rest of the state can expect dust and thunder storms.
