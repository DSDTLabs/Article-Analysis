Vadodara: Major ruckus took place in the Fatehpura with residents there staging protests on the road and blocking traffic as they had not been supplied water by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) since four days. Officials of the city police as well as the VMC rushed to the spot to control the situation.

 The residents of Hathikhana, Mahavat Falia, Genda Falia, Ranavas, Panjrigar Mohalla, Hujrat Paga, Chauhan Society and other surrounding areas had been struggling to get water despite the fact that the city is not facing any major water crisis presently. Residents claim that the civic body has not been able to resolve the issue despite repeated representations.
 
 According to local corporator Farid Lakhajiwala from the opposition Congress party, “The problem is because of an old pump that is not being replaced despite repeated requests. A proposal for changing the pump was even put before the standing committee of the civic body, but was sent back.”
 
 The pump develops snags repeatedly and water supply gets affected time and again. “Once it breaks down, there is no water in the area for a couple of days. The residents were at their wits end and hence took to the streets on Thursday,” said Lakhajiwala.
 
 After the traffic movement was stalled for quite some time in the afternoon, VMC officials rushed to the spot and assured the residents that water supply would begin soon. “But repairing the pump will only be a temporary solution,” said Lakhajiwala.
