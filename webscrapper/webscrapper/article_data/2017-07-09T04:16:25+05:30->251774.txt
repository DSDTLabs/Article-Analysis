GURUGRAM: The Metro link proposed between   and Gurgaon railway station is gaining momentum. 

 Chief minister   has asked urban development officials to submit a detailed project report (DPR) at the earliest.
 
 The discussions took place at a meeting on Friday attended by the chief minister and Union minister Rao Inderjit Singh, who is also the Gurugram MP. Several senior officials from various government departments also attended the meet. The officials briefed the ministers about the project and alternative route options.
 
 “The chief minister has asked the officials to work on the DPR for the Metro link, connecting  . When functional, it will be a huge relief for the people living in the old city,” said Singh. He, however, did not assign a timeline for the submission of the DPR.
 
 The   is proposed to start from Huda City Centre and then run through Subhash Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk and Sector 9 before connecting to Railway Road in Old Gurgaon on the way to the railway station. 
 
 According to the feasibility report prepared by DMRC, the route between Huda City Centre and the railway station is 17.11km . The project is estimated to cost Rs 3,739 crore.
 
 The Dwarka to Iffco Chowk Metro link, hanging fire for years, was also discussed at the meeting. 
 
 Talking about the plan to connect the old city with  , officials also discussed the route from Udyog Vihar to Mahavir Chowk. Khattar has asked the officials to start the work on the DPR for this route parallely.
 
 TOI had reported in May this year that the plan to connect Dwarka and Iffco Chowk through Metro was in the final stages. The proposal submitted to the state government by DMRC has been awaiting approval for several years now.
 
 The project has been delayed as Khattar had earlier expressed his reservation about approving the DMRC’s plan as he felt that the route would not attract enough commuters and the project would become economically unviable.
