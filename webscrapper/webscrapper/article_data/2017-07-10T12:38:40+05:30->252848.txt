JAIPUR: In what will come as a relief to homebuyers, the urban development and housing (UDH) department has finally started the process to establish a full-fledged   (RERA) in the state. 

 The UDH has forwarded a proposal to the   department to appoint a staff of 49 members for the regulatory authority. It is expected that the staff will be appointed in a month's time. As per the proposal, the authority will comprise members from legal, planning, finance, administration and informative technology (IT) fields. 
 
 At present, the regulatory authority comprises only two members - the registrar and the head of regulatory authority. In February, the   government had appointed additional chief secretary ( ) of UDH department as the regulatory authority. Till the time other members of regulatory authority are appointed, the department staff of two members is deployed temporarily. 
 
 According to reports, as per the mandatory provision, the developers have started registering themselves on RERA website. Once details of all ongoing projects are uploaded on the website, the aggrieved consumers can register their complaints at RERA office. 
 
 There are more than 300 under-constructed and 1,000 constructed projects in the state. However, the registration work of projects and agents is going on at a snail's pace in the state.
 
 As per the new rules, developers, projects and agents have 90 days to register after the RERA Act came into effect on May 1. The new regulatory authority is expected to end many troubles of homebuyers as it brings transparency in the existing system.
 
 Officials believe that the number of registration will increase now as the department has resolved the problems which developers were facing in registering with the RERA.
