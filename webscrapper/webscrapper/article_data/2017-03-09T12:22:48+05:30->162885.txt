Third in the ‘Thor’ franchise, ‘Thor: Ragnarok’ called for revamping Chris Hemsworth’s look. Director   is in for making it big and it started with chopping off Hemsworth’s locks and giving him shorter hair.

 
  
 But that wasn’t what took us by surprise. The social media is going gaga over Jeff Goldblum’s look as he portrays the Grandmaster, who is one of the oldest living beings in the universe. Spiky gray hair, blue kohl and the intense look has increased the hype around the character.
 
  
  
 The character of Grandmaster is that of a hedonist and pleasure-seeker. 
 Meanwhile, Hemsworth is ecstatic with his new look given that he doesn’t have to spend hours in the make-up room. He sees this as a rebirth for him not just as an actor but also his character. Isn’t this movie worth the wait?
