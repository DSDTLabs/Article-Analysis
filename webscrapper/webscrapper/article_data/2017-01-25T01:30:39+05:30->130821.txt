MUMBAI: From February, expect two new   buses to travel between Thane and Colaba and Mira Road and Churchgate/CST. The buses will be provided to the BEST ‘free of cost’ for three months before the undertaking takes a decision on purchasing more such buses, officials said.

 The fuel-efficient Volvo UD, which has a tie-up with a Japanese firm, will have minimum breakdowns compared to other AC buses, including Cerita buses, BEST officials claimed.
 
 At Tuesday’s committee meeting, BEST deputy general manager R R Deshpande said besides getting two AC Volvo buses on trial basis, the undertaking was also expediting the process of procuring 300   by March end. “A prototype of the non-AC bus will be inspected on January 27, and the first bus could hit the road in February,” he said.
 
 But the committee members were not happy with these announcements. “The need of the hour is to ensure that commuters don’t have to wait for 30 minutes at bus stops,” said Shiv Sena member Ranjan Chaudhari, referring to bunching of buses on any given route. Committee member Ravi Raja said for the past several months, the administration has been giving “high hopes” of procuring the new buses. “But till date, not a single bus has arrived. Also, we need to have good quality buses and not those that end up as white elephants,” he said, referring to the Cerita AC buses.
 
 Kedar Hombalkar from MNS said the bus body should be strong and resistant to the humidity and other weather conditions. Suhas Samant from Shiv Sena demanded an inquiry into the alleged corruption in scrapping old buses for rates lower than the reserve price, while fellow member Sandesh Kondwilkar sought an FIR to be lodged against the errant officials.
