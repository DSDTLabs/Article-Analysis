PUNE: Former Central Information Commissioner Shailesh Gandhi pointed out in a letter to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis the dismal rate of disposal of Right to Information   with just seven   in the state.

 The former Central Information Commissioner (CIC) demanded in the letter appointment of four commissioners — preferably   activists having a   understanding of the act — to help dispose of the cases. Nearly 40,000 cases are   before the State Information Commission.
 
 Gandhi stated that with the present State Information Commissioner, Ratnakar Gaikwad, set to retire soon, the state should appoint a commissioner immediately. Gaikwad’s term will end on May 31.
 
 Gandhi told TOI the act stated 11 information commissioners could be appointed and it was time that the state followed it. He said there were seven RTI commissioners in the state at Mumbai, Konkan, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Nagpur and Amravati. Having three more in the other parts of the state or in the same division would help clear the  , he said.
 
 In his letter to the CM he stated that there was a huge crisis in the implementation of RTI presently owing to huge backlogs in these benches and not appointing information commissioners in a timely manner by the government since 2005.
 
 “The seriousness of RTI should be taken up by the state. It has been increasingly seen that RTI activists are not given the replies by passing the buck to different departments in the first place and not providing convincing answers in the appeals too,” he added.
 
 As a long-term proposal, Gandhi requested for reviewing the requirements of the commissioners every six months.
