PANAJI: Science is one of the most lucrative and versatile careers to be in, said   vice-chancellor,   at the inauguration of the second edition of Science Film Festival of India (SCI-FFI) which opened on Tuesday.

 “Today, science repays you even in the monetary sense. We need to urge students to stay in science, a decision that will yield huge benefits for the country,” he said.
 
 Conceptualized by Vidnyan Parishad, SCI-FFI’s objective is to popularize science among the student community.“Science communication is often abstract. Through the medium of films, SCI-FFI is an attempt to help students understand scientific principles which in turn will attract them to pursue a career in science and technology,” said   president Suhas Godse.
 
 Attending the festival, lecturer at Sangolda-based  , Anjali Shetkar, said, “A festival like this gives an opportunity to watch movies from the scientific point of view. As a student, it tends to build interest in science because fiction is based on fact.”
 
 The four-day-long extravaganza will have a range of blockbuster science-fiction films, interactions by experts and scientists from January 17-20. The festival will focus on four distinct themes: mathematics, genetics, futuristic and space that will enthral the audience.
