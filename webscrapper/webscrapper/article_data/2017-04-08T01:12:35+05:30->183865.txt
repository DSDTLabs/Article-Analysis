Jewar: The residents of  , a sleepy   of Greater  , 75km from New Delhi, have been thrown into a state of excitement after chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath gave his go-ahead for an international   in the area.

 The Jewar tehsil comprises 92 villages with each village having a population between 5,000 and 10,000. On Friday, the prevailing mood was that of anticipation: of an overall environment of development, of jobs that the new airport will create and compensation for land that will be acquired for the project. If all goes as per plan, nearly a dozen of these villages could give way to a sprawling hub for international aviation, complete with swanky infrastructure.
 
 As per the proposal, the airport will come up along the 165-km Yamuna expressway from Greater Noida to Jewar, largely on land that is currently under cultivation. Nearly 5,000 hectares of land has been put aside for the project in the area. Speaking to farmers in some villages earmarked for the project by the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority, TOI gathered that most farmers in the tehsil were looking forward to giving up their land to the government. “We are not opposed to acquisition of our land by the government. But we want adequate compensation,” said 75-year-old Vijay Shankar Sharma of Neemka village. Ajay Singh, a 66-year-old  , echoed the sentiment: “Most of us have small landholdings, just between five and 15 bighas. Most are poor farmers, who cannot make two ends meet and under severe debt owning money to the farmers with larger land lots as every harvest pushes us deeper into debt,” he said. “For us, it will be a boon to have an airport here as it will definitely boost development,” he added.
 
 The willingness of farmers to sell their land could stem from the poor state of  . Residents of Thora village said they hope to get favourable terms for their land.
