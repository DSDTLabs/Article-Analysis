He has witnessed lives of people going for a toss and the wave of intolerance. Moved by the experience, writer and director Zaigham Imam’s latest film ‘Alif’ puts forth a message — ‘Ladna nahi, padhna zaroori hai’.

 Imam’s new film is about a Muslim father who wants his son to be a doctor. For this, his son who is studying in an orthodox seminary education is admitted to a regular school.

 He promotes his movie as an unbelievable true story of a Muslim boy. “It narrates the conflicts of being a Muslim. I aspire for a secular education for all,” he said. The film had a world premiere at Indian International Film Festival of Queensland, Australia last November.
 
 It also includes IPS officer Simala Prasad in a key role. The officer from the 2011 batch and who belongs to the Madhya Pradesh cadre is at present serving as SP in Dindori district.
