PATNA: The   (AIIMS-P) students said on Monday the rustication of a final year male student for walking semi-naked in the girls’ hostel on February 27 was a decision taken in haste and demanded review of the order. They also blamed the institute management for security lapses leading to such an embarrassing situation. 

 The student in question belonged to the 2014 batch of MBBS and hails from  . Sources said he had entered the girls’ nursing hostel instead of the boys’ hostel under the influence of ‘bhang’ (cannabis), which he had consumed at a pre-Holi celebration that day. They said his ‘lungi’ fell off when he ran into the girls’ hostel.
 
 “The main issue is of security. There should be a boundary wall around both the hostels. The student in question never had ‘bhang’ in his life earlier and lost senses under its impact,” an MBBS student said.
 
 “With no boundary wall or any barricading around, anybody can enter the hostels. There are only two security guards near the entrance of each hostel,” another student said. 
 
 AIIMS-P medical superintendent Dr   said a wall would be erected soon between the girls and boys’ hostels.
 
 A senior AIIMS-P official said initially the student who entered the girls’ hostel was rusticated for one year, but the period was increased to three years under pressure from girl students. “The boy had a clean record as far as I know. We are worried as to how this might affect his future,” he said.
