CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu’s second most watched politically important case — the PILs to disqualify deputy chief minister   and 10 other   loyal to him for having defied the AIADMK party whip in February 2017 — is ripe for judgment, as   reserved its orders on Tuesday. The cases, filed both by DMK and legislators from TTV Dhinakaran faction, would decide the fate of the 11 MLAs and decide whether they should be disqualified for having defied an AIADMK whip and voted against a vote of confidence moved by Chief Minister   in February 2017.

 Concluding the hearing, the first bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Abdul Quddhose directed the parties to file their respective written arguments by March 5.
 
 Earlier, senior counsel Kapil Sibal, representing the DMK, submitted that the speaker of TN assembly had failed in his constitutional responsibility by not initiating   proceedings against Paneerselvam and 10 other MLAs who voted against the motion. Therefore, it is for the court to fulfil its obligation by directing such an action, he said.
 
 Senior counsel P S Raman, representing the TTV Dhinakaran loyalists, submitted that when a no confidence motion was moved against the government it was the duty of all members of the ruling party to vote in favour of the government.
 
 “Similarly, when a motion of confidence is moved by the chief minister it is the bounden duty of all the party legislators to vote in favour of such motion. There is no question of whip in such circumstances. Voting against the motion amounts to voting against the government,” Raman said.
 
 Recently, assembly secretary K Boopathy, who was also a party to the pleas, caught everyone by surprise by stating that he had no submission to make in pleas seeking disqualification of Panneerselvam and 10 other MLAs.
