KOZHIKODE: There should be a policy for forming political alliances, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Different political and peopleâ€™s groups should be unified to fight against the threats raised by the   forces based on this policy,   stressed while speaking at National seminar against Communal Fascism, here on Saturday. Addressing the seminar, Pinarayi Vijayan urged the need to merge all sections of people across the country to fight against communalization and globalization.

 The Indian National   is not a substitute for the BJP, alleged Pinarayi saying that it was the anti-people policies of the Congress that helped the   to come into power. Though some political moves were made in Uttar Pradesh and   with the support of the Congress, the efforts failed to derive any result, Pinarayi Vijayan added. The Samajwadi Party suffered defeat in the UP where as a major alley of the   in Bihar left the alliance and joined the BJP camp, Pinarayi Vijayan said blaming Congress incapable of fighting the BJP.
 
 It is the Left Democratic Front that has been fighting tooth and nail against communalism and globalization, claimed Pinarayi Vijayan during the seminar organized by a CPM- think tank, Keluettan Centre for Study and Research.
