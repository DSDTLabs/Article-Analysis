SHAHJAHANPUR: Fakirelal Bhojwal, a social worker here, has announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh to anyone who provides information leading to Honeypreet’s arrest.   said he was very upset with how Gurmeet   Singh and his adopted daughter have given a bad name to “father-daughter relationship”. 

 On Thursday, posters declaring   “wanted” were pasted on the walls of the collectorate and nearby areas. Bhojwal, who had earlier demanded self-styled godman Asaram’s arrest in 2013, sat on a dharna outside the collectorate and demanded Honeypreet’s arrest. He threatened to launch a hunger strike in case she is not arrested within a week.
 
 “India is a country known for its saints like Guru Nanak, Sant Kabir and Tulsidas. However, today, people like   and Asaram are giving a bad name to our great country. I am happy that the government has started identifying such cheats and action is being taken against them. The truth behind the relationship between Ram Rahim and his daughter is disgraceful. I have been having sleepless nights ever since I came to know about it. I will get peace only when she is arrested,” Bhojwal said.
 
 Meanwhile, city magistrate Vinay Srivastava said that the social worker’s dharna was peaceful and they hadn’t received any memorandum from him.
