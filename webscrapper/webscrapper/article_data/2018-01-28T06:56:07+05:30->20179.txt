LUCKNOW: The Vishwa Hindu Parisahd (VHP) is once again planning to galvanise support and build a tempo for  . With the Modi government already in its fourth year and   elections slated to be held in 2019, VHP is shoring up its efforts to connect with masses by organising a Ram Mahotsava in March.

 VHP will be organising special puja in temples in villages and towns to build sentiment in favour of Ram Temple during the 15-day Ram Mahotsava. Over 150 representatives from various saffron outfits, including VHP,   and  , assembled at Ayodhya on Saturday to work out a strategy to connect with people and drum up support.
 
 It was decided that recitation of ‘Ramcharitmanas’ will be held at ‘maths’ and temples and special pujas will be organised from March 18 to give momentum to Ram Temple movement. The mahotsava will conclude on March 31, which also happens to be ‘Hanuman Jayanti’. “It’s a religious event and district-level workers of VHP will ensure maximum participation of people in it,” said VHP spokesperson  . Funds will also be arranged by district workers, he added.
 
 Ram Temple has been on the agenda of every VHP meet of late. The ‘Dharma Sansad’ held in Karnataka in November proposed construction of the temple in a time-bound manner. The meeting of VHP central management committee in Bhubaneswar in December also approved mobilisation of masses in favour of temple.
 
 “Not only Hindus, but followers of other faiths have also extended support to us. Sikhs will hold ‘paath’ of Guru Granth Sahib and Jains will also perform puja,” said Sharma.
 
 VHP had kept its temple agenda low key since Modi government came to power because   did not have majority in the Upper House, said a VHP leader. But, with Lok Sabha elections a year away and the case pending in Supreme Court, VHP has started giving a push to its agenda again. “We should be prepared to construct the temple whenever the verdict comes,” said a VHP worker.
