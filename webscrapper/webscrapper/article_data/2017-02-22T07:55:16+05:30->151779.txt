BENGALURU: The hand that wields the scalpel could be as adroit with the painting brush as well. Twenty-five artistically inclined doctors proved as much at an exhibition of their works at  . 

 The four-day Drs@ART show put together by Sameeksha Art, Research and Media concluded on Tuesday. "I've been painting with watercolours for a very long time, but once I started working I didn't have as much time to paint as I used to, so I switched to painting on my iPad. I usually paint human figures and subjects in motion. I would recommend using the painting and drawing apps on tablets to those leading busy lives," said Dr Rakesh S Ramesh, 42, a surgical oncologist at St.Johns Hospital.
 
 Dr  , 51, was first exposed to encaustic art 10 years ago, and that experience left her fascinated by both the colours and the technique. "I paint with beeswax; the tools I use are also different from regular art tools, as they include items like hot plate for a palate, hot air guns and gas torches," she said. "Very few of us in India practise this style, because we have to make our own paints and mediums," she added . 
 
  It is fitting then that this artist and doctor practices and provides counselling at the   of Art, Design and Technology. 
 
  Dr Sangeetha B is one of the youngest artists at the event, having completed her MBBS recently. She is one month away from finishing her internship at the   and Hospital. She exhibited two of her pen-and-ink sketches. "It was inspiring to see so many accomplished doctors as well as painters. It was great and inspiring to know that, as it showed me that going forward, I too could continue in the same way," she said.
