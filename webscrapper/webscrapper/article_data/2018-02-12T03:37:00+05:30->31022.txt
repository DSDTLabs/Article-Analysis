Vijayawada: Thick fog on Sunday morning delayed in-flight services at the Gannavaram Airport. Hundreds of passengers waited as flights were delayed by almost an hour disrupting the operations of the airports.

 Air India flight from Delhi to Vijayawada was delayed by almost 35 minutes, which also affected the return journey. N Sanjya, a passenger, said: “Delay in flights has become common at the Gannavaram airport, and this is the third time in past two months. Airport officials simply change arrival times, without giving more information. There is all the likelihood that we will miss the connecting flight.” 
 
 Poor visibility affected the operations of True Jet service from Hyderabad. SpiceJet’ Bangalore-Hyderabad flight arrived 20 minutes late, and passengers waited for more than an hour after check-in. 
 
 “Thick fog delaying flight operations is a common problem during winters,” said Srinivas K, passenger from Bangalore. “We missed an important meeting because of the delay.” Airline operators, however, try to convince passengers that these are natural and unavoidable conditions, and that flight safety cannot be compromised. 
 
 Mastan Valli, terminal manager at the airport, said the fog has been interrupting landings for past three weeks. “We try to clear the runway for landing in shortest possible time. It was not our mistake. Fog is dangerous for aircraft that are landing. Poor visibility affects landing, and we cannot take the risk,” he said. “We try to cover the delays by completing checks on time.”
