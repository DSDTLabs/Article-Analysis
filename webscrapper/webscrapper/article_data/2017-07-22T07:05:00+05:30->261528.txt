Dharamshala: Continuing with his broadside against chief minister   Singh, former minister and senior Congress leader Major Vijai Singh Mankotia on Friday said that the CM and his family on bail are criminalizing politics in the state. At a press conference today, he also urged the governor to put Himachal Pradesh under President’s rule. 

 Mankotia was ousted as vice-chairman of tourism development board this month for his differences with the CM. “Virbhadra is solely responsible for the outrage over the rape and murder of a minor girl,” he said. 
 
 Elaborating on media reports on the statement of the wife of an accused who died in police custody, he said that if arresting the Nepali man was a deal then there is Jungle Raj in the state like in Bihar. “If it is true, than Virbhadra Singh has broken the records of Lalu Prasad Yadav,” he added. Suraj Singh’s (29) wife was quoted by sections of the media alleging that her late husband’s arrest was a deal. 
 
 Mankotia also took on Sudhir Sharma, a close aide of the CM Sudhir Sharma who was holding charge of the urban development ministry. “There has been a scandal under the paragliding world cup at Bir-Billing. It was an NGO of Baijanth which benefited from this. Exorbitant amount of money was sanctioned for this without considering the lawful facts” added Mankotia.
 
 He said that the Chairman of Airport Authority of India was sacked for sponsoring this event. The CM has announced an additional financial package for the event because of the involvement of his close aide, Mankotia alleged. “I had objected to it, so did many officers,” he said.
