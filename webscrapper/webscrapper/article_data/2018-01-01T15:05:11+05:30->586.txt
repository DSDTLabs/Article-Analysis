After the first look of Dr   was released previously,   and  's first look of ‘Gayatri’ was released today.

    posted the first look poster on his social media, captioning it, “One of the most challenging roles I played so far. And one of my career best song in #Gayatri. Hope you all like the my first look from #Gayatri” (sic) The first look features Vishnu Manchu and Shriya Saran. While Vishnu Manchu has usually always been seen in action or comedic roles, the first look hints at a softer role this time around. Besides, Vishnu and Shriya who are sharing the screen for the first time, look adorable in the first look. 
 
  In the poster, he can be seen braiding a visibly pregnant Shriya Saran’s hair. In fact, it’s not just Vishnu who believes in his role; even Director   believes that Vishnu’s role in ‘Gayatri’ will be attention-grabbing. Apart from Vishnu Manchu, it is Dr Mohan Babu who has been creating a buzz for the film so far. In ‘Gayatri’ the veteran actor is touted to play double roles – that of both a hero and a villain. While Dr Mohan Babu was well-known for his negative role in the 80s, he had since turned to positive characters. But now, it would be refreshing to see the star do what he does best. 
 
  ‘Gayatri’ that also stars Brahmanandam and Anasuya Bharadwaj is slated for release on February 9, 2018 and the film will feature music by  . Apart from ‘Gayatri’, Vishnu is working on ‘Acharya America Yatra’, the bi-lingual ‘Voter’ and ‘Kural388’ in Tamil.
