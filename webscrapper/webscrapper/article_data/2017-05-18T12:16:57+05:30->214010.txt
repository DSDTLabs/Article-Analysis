 While talking about her relationship status, Shraddha said, “I am happy being single and focussing on my work. Agar boyfriend hota toh main distract ho jaati. Right now I don’t feel it's necessary. Yes, sometimes it's difficult to give time to a relationship. But I don't believe it's impossible. If you want to have a relationship, you will manage to balance it with work. My definition and understanding of love keeps evolving. My current understanding of love is that when it happens you cannot deny it; you can't help it, no matter what you do. I view love as a necessity. Pyar har insaan ki zindagi me bahut zaroori hai. I was, but I don't want to be a possessive girlfriend anymore. I want to give space to that person. Allow them to do what they want.”
