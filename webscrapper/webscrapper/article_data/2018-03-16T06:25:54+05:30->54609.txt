KOLKATA: The initial post-mortem report of the unusual death of 72-year-old   — a resident of a threestorey building in the heart of   at   — has revealed that she might have died at least 48 hours before the death was reported. “This suggests that the youngest son was alone with his dead mother for around two days,” an investigating officer said.

 Two of Vandana’s sons, who lived with her, are psychiatric patients. However, the other sibling had left the Bansdroni home a week before his her death. “The eldest son,  , said he would take care of his youngest brother at his Garia residence,” the officer said.
 
 “The other son had left about a week ago, probably realizing that his mother was dying. This wouldn’t be the first time that he has done so,” he added.
