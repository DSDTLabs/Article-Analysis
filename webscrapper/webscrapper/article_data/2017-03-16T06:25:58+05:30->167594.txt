BENGALURU: Stayzilla CEO   said he was being treated unfairly by police and was charged with a false criminal case, when it was only a civil one. In a blog post, which was published by his wife and fellow cofounder   a few hours after his arrest on Tuesday, Vasupal gave a detailed account of events that transpired in the past two months between the company and the advertising agency that made the police complaint.

 On March 9, he said, the Bengaluru police came to his house in the city , without a warrant, over a case filed against the company in Chennai.“I don't personally owe anybody money,“ Vasupal said.
 
 He said the company had paid over 80%, or Rs 6.5 crore, of the money owed over a period of three years. "...we have repeatedly asked the other party to go to court if they felt there was any wrong," Vasupal wrote. He added that the advertising company, in response, started intimidating family members. He alleged that co-founder  's family was threatened by sending a package containing the picture of Singhi's son attached to a voodoo doll.
 
 Earlier last month, the company also had a run-in with their landlord over delay in rent payment.
