AMRITSAR: Walkers at   in Amritsar were surpirsed to find cricketer-turned-politician   among them on Sunday morning. It was not something new for them as Sidhu, during his previous elections, used to campaign among morning walkers. 

 The only difference this time was that the former Indian opener was batting for the  , not for the BJP. Sidhu is the Amritsar East candiate of the Congress. 
 
 Interacting with morning walkers of all age groups, Sidhu tried to make them understand what had made him disenchanted with the ruling SAD-BJP alliance in Punjab.
 
 Accompanied by Congress candidates   (Amritsar West) and   (Amritsar North), Sidhu showered praise on them for supporting him. “I have come to Punjab to make it free of debt and drugs; this is my only dream in life now,” he said. 
 
 Pointing toward his cricket and TV show fans, Sidhu said he had played cricket for 20 years and had been part of various TV shows, but now Punjab was his top priority.
 
 Playing an economist, Sidhu said he would tell Punjabis that the state was under a debt of Rs 1.88 lakh thousand crore. He once again reiterated to expose deeds of the ruling SAD-BJP alliance at a press conference. 
 
 A few BJP workers were also seen at the venue to hear Sidhu swearing by the name of Congress leaders whom he had been censuring at the same venue a couple of years ago. Attacking the Badal family, he said, “I will tell how the people’s government was made a family’s government.”
 
 There were many who, on hearing Sidhu, just laughed away and continued with their morning routine. 
 
 Later, he went to a local tea stall and interacted with morning walkers having a cup of tea. He also shook hands with passers-by and motorists.
