British actress   wore all-black at the 75th   in solidarity with the movement against the epidemic of sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and beyond.

  The 27-year-old actress, who brought a gender activist as her date for the ceremony, said, "We are wearing black in solidarity. It makes me really emotional thinking about the fact that this movement that we have put together is across industries, across communities, across faces."
 
  
  
 "This issue does not really affect women in  . This issue is affecting women everywhere, every country around the world. It is global and we all are doing it together," she added.
 
  Speaking on the same note, filmmaker   and actress  , who also donned black attire, said that the step is taken to stand 'with other like-minded people.'
 
  "It's like standing side-by-side with other like-minded people, who believe in justice and dignity for all. Its simple. It's not a solution. I'm with it," DuVernay said.
 
  Janney added, "I'm wearing black to stand with every man and women out here in Hollywood to stand-up for people, mostly women, who have been sexually abused, assaulted or harassed and made them feel unsafe at workplace and who have been held back because of their sex. We want equality to be there."
 
  The colour black was chosen as a way for the film and TV industry to make a statement against the pervasive culture of misconduct brought to light by the downfall of shamed movie mogul  .
