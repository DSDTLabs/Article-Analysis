Surat: Currently, Namita Ganjawala is Gujarat’s only practicing woman  .

 A young daughter of a mill worker from a lower middle class family of Ganchi community, living in a 10x10 ft room 15 years ago, she stood fourth in class X board exams.
 
 Helpful souls from this city of angels came forward and supported her till she became a doctor and completed masters in psychiatry. 
 
 She took up sexology along with psychiatry as many of her patients suffered from problems related to sex. Today at 32, she treats at least 30 patients on a daily basis, and has already made a name for herself.
 
 From Surat Municipal School to Ambaba Girls High School to Bhulka Bhavan in class XI and XII, Namita’s journey has been a memorable one. 
 
 “I took up psychiatry because my father Navinchandra suffered from severe psychiatric disorder,” said Ganjawala, adding, “His troubles aggravated after my class X result as he was worried about finding a way to foot my education bills and other things.”
 
 She recalls, “When we didn’t have anything to eat, suddenly people came offering me totally free education and started taking care of me.”
 
 “I was at a crossroads of my life and I had to succeed for them,” she said.
 
 Ganjawala received a shocker during her first MBBS, when she was rejected for her poor social and financial status. 
 
 “I decided on that day to fight the world and fight hard to succeed,” Namita said.
 
 After becoming a doctor and psychiatrist – sexologist, she joined Dr Mukul Choksi, and started working with him. 
 
 In a span of seven years, she now has her own car, a house where her parents live comfortably with her, and she has seen her elder brother Kalpesh settled. 
 
 However, age-old prejudices are yet to leave her alone. “My male patients are shocked initially, but when I tell them you can speak freely, they become comfortable,” she adds.
