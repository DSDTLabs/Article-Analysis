While a bevy of   beauties are slated to walk the Cannes red carpet this year, all eyes will be on  , who joins Cannes queen   and fashionista   as the global ambassador of a cosmetic giant. If you thought there could be sparks flying on the red carpet, you are mistaken. Sources confirm that there won’t be any clash as the actresses will make appearances on different days and are unlikely to even bump into each other. 

 “Deepika Padukone will walk the red carpet on May 17-18, Aishwarya on May 19-20, and Sonam on May 21-22,” revealed a spokesperson for the brand. When asked about sharing the platform with Aishwarya, Deepika was all praise for her. She added, “Our dates are different but if our paths cross, I will definitely catch up with her. She is someone who has represented not just the brand but India so beautifully for years. I know her otherwise as well and I’ve always admired the way she conducts herself.”
