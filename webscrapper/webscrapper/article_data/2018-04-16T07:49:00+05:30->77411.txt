Ludhiana: Imran, a one-and-a-half-year-old baby boy of the nomad community went missing from a roadside shanty around Jalandhar Byepass on Saturday night. This comes amid outrage over the rape and murder of a nomad girl in Kathua of Jammu and Kashmir. Police have registered a kidnapping case against unidentified accused into the matter.

 Imran’s father Shahdin — a nomad who is into raising buffaloes — told police that he and his wife Nijja were sleeping in their makeshift hut on the roadside on Jalandhar Byepass on Saturday night, and his two children had gone to their maternal grandparents place in Machiwara.
 
 Shahdin said at around 2.30am on Sunday, a migrant worker living in quarters in the area started raising an alarm about his bag being stolen. He added that they got up because of the noise in the area, and were shocked to see their youngest child Imran missing from there. Shahdin said initially they searched for him in the area, but after they could not find him, they informed the police.
 
 On being informed, cops from Saleem Tabri police station reached the spot and started investigation into the matter. Station house officer (SHO) of Saleem Tabri police station, inspector Vijay Kumar, said the child belonged to a nomadic community who would move from one place to another for cattle raising. He added they were registering a kidnapping case under Section 363 (punishment for kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against unidentified accused in the matter. “We are making efforts to recover the child,” he said.
 
 Police officials said they were scanning CCTV footage of the area to find out some clues about the kidnapper. They added that because it was a Sunday, not many factories had their CCTVs switched on in the area. “Also, the place where the incident took place is a secluded spot with not much human activity, while the family lives on the roadside,” said a police officer. Cops said the police had flashed the message about the missing child with his picture in various police stations, so that they could get some information about him.
 
 Police sources said Imran’s family had links with nomads in Jammu and Kashmir, and they had been living in Punjab for several years.
