Tiger Shroff, we hear, has performed some high-octane action scenes in director Ahmed Khan’s ' '. While the actor pulled off the sequences with relative ease, BT has it that shooting for the scenes wasn’t easy for the makers. Helicopters were crucial for a lot of action sequences, which were shot in the jungles of Krabi Island,  . We hear that the makers had to wait for months to seek permission for the shoot. Also, one of the key scenes required two helicopters to fly dangerously close to each other and setting it up required plenty of planning since it involved a lot of risk. Tiger practised for the sequence for many days to perfect his timing and shot the sequence without any hiccups. For those who have come in late, '  2' also features Tiger's rumoured girlfriend Disha Patani as his leading lady. The first outing in the 'Baaghi' series released almost two years ago and was directed by Sabbir Khan, who had also helmed 'Heropanti' with Tiger.
