BENAGLURU: The   (SIT) probing journalist-activist Gauri Lankesh’s murder has taken four men arrested for allegedly hatching a plot to kill   into its custody.

 The accused were produced before the III Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court on Thursday afternoon. While the SIT sought their custody for 15 days, the court granted only 10 days, directing the cops to produce them before it again on June 9.
 
 With the four accused landing in  , the number of accused arrested in Gauri murder case rose to five. Gunrunner from Maddur K T Naveen Kumar alias Hotte Manja is in judicial custody.
 
 While Naveen was arrested in February, second accused   from Shikaripura in Shivamogga was arrested on May 9. The other three accused — Amol Kale from Pune, Amit Degvekar alias Manohar Degvekar from Maharashtra and Manohar Edave from Vijayapura— were arrested on May 21. 
 
 All the five accused wanted to kill Bhagawan for his anti-religion views and had named their mission as ‘Death For The Irreligious’, SIT sources said.
 
 “Naveen met Sujit at a religious conference held in Goa in June 2017. In his speech, Naveen had fumed that anti-religion persons should be shot dead. Encouraged by his speech, Sujit became close to Naveen. In October 2017, Sujit arranged a meeting at Gundyal dam, Kollegal, where the five prepared a blue print on Bhagawan’s murder,” sources said.
 
 They never used mobile phones or addressed each other with their real names, sources said. “They would converse using coin box phones. While receiving or calling, they used different names. Sujit was called as Dada, Amol Bai Saab, Edave Chote and Degvekar Oil. Naveen was Anna,” they added.
