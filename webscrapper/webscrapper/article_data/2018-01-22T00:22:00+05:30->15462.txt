Not silhouette shots or pixelated video clips, a new initiative in Bengaluru is placing an ear in the city through a radio. A handbag, equipped with audio devices, is currently making the rounds of college campuses in town, recording stories of  ,  , stereotyping,  ,  , risk, desire and other experiences that students would like to talk about. Called 
 , this unique project strives to create a safe space for young individuals to interact, reflect and organize through the “beautiful anonymity” that audio provides. It is initiated by   — a city-based media and arts collective. 

  “Right now, we are in the stage of listening to stories in and around educational premises. Although sexual harassment remains our prime focus, other issues such as bullying and peer pressure are also being covered. We intend to keep the entire exercise informal and relaxed, so that the students are at ease and spontaneous. Whether or not they want to disclose their identity will be up to them. Stories collected via this drive will later be put together and broadcast at various listening rooms across the city. These makeshift booths may pop up at   or Lalbagh; a café or bookstore; or a terrace. Modelled on the old community radio setup, the basic idea is to trigger talking points on these issues, hoping the exercise will eventually lead to a dialogue and possible solutions,” explains  , Co-Founder at Maraa. 
 
  These listening booths will be further used as research tools for a larger impact, involving individuals, collectives and lawyers working on these issues. “The objective is also to delve into the wide canvas of discrimination on campuses, the culture of silence and shame that breed violence, as well as the backlash that students face when they decide to speak up,” she sums up.
