PATNA: The Bihar BJP led by deputy CM   (SuMo) on Thursday assailed former Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha, albeit without naming him, for his criticism of the country’s economy under the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. 

 Sinha wrote an article titled, ‘I need to speak up now’, in a newspaper, noting that the country’s economy was in a mess and its GDP has fallen consistently for six quarters. 
 
 In a tweet, SuMo said, “People are inconvenienced even when roads and bridges are constructed, but ultimately people are benefited. Same with DeMo & GST.”
 
 SuMo, who also holds the finance portfolio, has presented the state budget seven times between 2007 to 2013. The Manmohan Singh led-UPA government with P Chidambaram as finance minister had made SuMo chairman of the empowered committee of states’ finance ministers to negotiate the GST with respective state governments. The move, however, faced rough weather as the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi and a few other BJP-ruled states opposed the UPA’s version of GST.
 
 State BJP spokesman and former MLA Rajib Ranjan said the GST and ‘notebandi’ would prove to be a game changer for the country’s economy. “They should know that no economy is assessed on the basis of the GDP of one quarter,” Ranjan added.
 
 Another Bihar BJP spokesman Suresh Rungta sounded more acerbic as he said, “Certain leaders have resorted to criticising economic policies of the Narendra Modi government. They are only venting out their ‘kuntha (frustration)’ and ‘bhadas (suppressed anger)’.”
