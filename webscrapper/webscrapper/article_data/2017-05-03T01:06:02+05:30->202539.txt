Pune: The Public Concern for Governance Trust on Tuesday demanded prosecution of every individual responsible for accidents caused by   speed breakers, including officers of the Pune Municipal Corporation, responsible for their construction and maintenance.

 A delegation of the Public Concern for Governance Trust on Tuesday met police commissioner Rashmi Shukla. The members handed Shukla a memorandum requesting the police to ensure that speed breakers proliferating across the city are made strictly as per the prescribed guidelines issued by the Indian Roads Congress and upheld in a Bombay High Court judgement in 2005.
 
 The trust members, including A. V. Krishnan, D. V. R. Rao and P. M. Dhakephalkar, cited recent examples of accidents that involved faulty speed beakers, including the case of the man booked for the death of his mother that resulted from his bike skidding over a faulty speed breaker.
 
 The memorandum, submitted by the trust members, said, “In every single case, only the driver has been booked for rash and negligent driving. However, such accidents take place not only because of negligence on the part of the driver but also because of faulty speed breakers”.
 
 The members urged the police commissioner to initiate steps to ensure accountability of relevant municipal staff members for such accidents in future. They furtherwent on to urge her to register cases against them for negligence to ensure their conviction.
 
 They also highlighted the inadequate markings on the speed breakers as well as lack of street lighting, thus making them invisible for drivers at night.
