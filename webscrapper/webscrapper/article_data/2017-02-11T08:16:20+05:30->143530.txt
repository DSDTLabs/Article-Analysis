NEW DELHI: Two national and international-level  , both minors, have alleged   at the hands of their coach during their training days a few years ago.

 The girls told the police that this was not the first time that they tried to raise the issue. They said the man threatened to circulate their objectionable pictures and obscene videos made by him if they told anyone about the incident.
 
 They alleged that they were being tortured for the past seven-eight years, but it’s only now that they gathered courage to make their trauma public despite constant threats given by the accused.
 
 One of the girls, a Class IX student, told the police that she was sexually assaulted by one of her teachers. She called up the coach and he asked her not to talk about such things on phone and visit him at his house. When she reached there, he spiked her drink with a sedative and raped her after she fell unconscious. When she confronted him, he showed her objectionable pictures clicked by him and threatened her that he would circulate them if she said anything to anyone.
 
 The other girl also said that the man had mixed something in her food and after she fell unconscious, he raped her.
 
 The incident took place in Jharkhand, but the girls filed a case at Kamala Market police station as they knew that faster action will be taken by Delhi Police. “We were sure that   will take swift action in the case,” said one of the victims.
 
 “We have filed a zero FIR and have referred the case to Dhanbad police for further investigations,” said Mandeep Randhawa, DCP (central).
 
 The accused, however, had denied the charges claiming innocence. He has, in fact, blamed the charges on political rivalry.
