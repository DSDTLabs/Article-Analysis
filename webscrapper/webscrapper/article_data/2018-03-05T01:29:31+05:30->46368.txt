NEW DELHI: A 50-year-old man has been arrested for killing his 70-year-old mother and burning her body. The man had disposed of the body in a jungle and then registered a missing persons’ complaint at the police station.

 Police said that they received a PCR call from a man on Thursday, stating that he had found a woman’s body near his house, soon after which a police team took the body to a mortuary.
 
 On Wednesday, the woman’s son Anil had registered a missing complaint at the Shahbad Dairy police station. He had told the cops that his mother went out for a stroll and did not return. When she did not get back, he searched for her everywhere and approached the cops when his efforts were in vain.
 
 A picture of the woman’s charred body was circulated by the cops. Since a missing complaint was registered by Anil in the same area, the cops called his sister to identify the body as possibly their mother’s. The woman recognised the body and said it was her mother Jamna Devi as she recognised her rings.
 
 When questioned, the woman told the cops that her brother often used to quarrel with her mother on property matters and even threatened her if she did not transfer the property to him.
 
 Police said on sustained questioning, Anil confessed of killing his mother. He was arrested and a case under sections of the IPC for murder and destroying evidences was registered at the Shahbad Dairy police station.
