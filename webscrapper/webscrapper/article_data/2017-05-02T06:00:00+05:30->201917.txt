Visakhapatnam: The TDP coordination committee for the  , the annual plenary of the party, has shortlisted the Andhra University Engineering College grounds as the venue for the three-day conclave that will be conducted from May 27 to 29. At least, 15 committees would be set up to look after various issues like registrations, accommodation, transport and food. 

 After checking five areas in the city — vacant land at Old Dairy Farm,   ground, land in Steel Plant area, Mudasarlova and Rajiv Gandhi Indoor stadium — the committee had finalised the AU grounds. Though some politicians favoured the Old Dairy Farm land, which was convenient for parking and traffic, the TDP leaders chose Andhra University grounds as there are expecting a huge gathering of 20,000 cadres, including 5,000 from Telangana. The coordination committee’s meeting, chaired by AP TDP president and energy minister Kala Venkata Rao, was held here on Monday. Various issues including financial aspects of the Mahanadu were discussed at the meeting. Speaking to mediapersons, Kala Venkata Rao said the Mahanadu would take key decisions regarding the welfare of the poor people and development of the state. Venkata Rao said they chose AU grounds as the venue after analysing all aspects. When asked why the government was violating its own rule to avoid using educational institutions grounds for political purpose, he tried to justify the move by saying the ground is in the centre of the city and even the Nizam College ground in Hyderabad was used by various political parties. He said the Mahanadu would be conducted for a good cause as the decisions taken in the conclave would benefit the people of the state. The R&B minister Ch Ayyanna Patrudu said there is no hard and fast rule about conducting a meeting in educational institutions. Besides, the party is conducting the meeting for a good cause. HRD minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao and Anakapalli MP M Srinivasa Rao were present at the meeting.
