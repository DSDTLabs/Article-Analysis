PANAJI: While state tourism authorities blamed the director general for civil aviation as the reason why the seaplane service failed to take off in the state, Union ministry of civil aviation claimed that no proposal had come to them for commercial seaplane operations. The Union minister for civil aviation   on Saturday said that only after applications were received would the clearances be given.

 “This is news to me. In the civil aviation policy we have explicitly made provisions for seaplanes and we would be very happy to have seaplanes come forward so I would like to know which is the party that has applied and it is an open invitation to parties to come and apply,” Union secretary for civil aviation   said, while speaking to reporters in South Goa.
 
 “We would be very happy to give approvals. I will have to check up, but I must confess, immediately I am not aware of such a proposal,” he added.
 
 The much-awaited seaplane services, which were set to commence in Goa last year failed to take off with Goa Tourism officials claiming that the due permissions required to start the operations were not given by  , which reports to the Union ministry of civil aviation. 
 
 The delay had been caused as DGCA had delayed the inspection of the identified landing sites. Seaplane operator MehAir wanted to capitalize its tourism industry, but had to put its plans on hold due to the pending DGCA inspection.
 
 But, the latest remarks made by the Union ministry of civil aviation officials raises more questions.
 
 When asked why the necessary approvals had not been given, Raju said, “We will give the approvals when the party applies to the DGCA.”
 
 “DGCA has to clear the aircraft. I can assure you that once DGCA clears the aircraft for safely flying in India, we have no objections to give the licenses ,” Raju added.
