CENTURION: South Africa’s Test captain Faf du Plessis will start batting in the nets from Wednesday to be ready in time for the Test matches against Australia. Wicketkeeper batsman Quinton de Kock already did the same on Tuesday when he joined the T20 team which will take on India here at the SuperSport Park. Dale Steyn is busy targeting one of the four-day domestic matches for Titans so as to be match-ready for Australia. Temba Bavuma has a club game planned in Soweto the coming Sunday. AB de Villiers is expected to make a full recovery in time for the same.

 
 
 
 The injury-ridden South African team, one that couldn’t put together its best eleven in the ODIs against India and have assembled an altogether different unit for the T20s, are racing against time to be fit for the four-Test series against Australia.
 
 The question is, will the   take a cue from such a scenario and give the Indian cricketers the much-needed rest between now and the Indian Premier League ( )?
 
 Following the two months of IPL, India are scheduled to tour England for five Test matches, three ODIs and three T20Is. Before the IPL, India are expected to play five T20 matches (if they make the final) in a tri-series involving Sri Lanka and Bangladesh this March to commemorate 70th anniversary of Sri Lanka’s independence. The BCCI could clearly give senior cricketers some much-required rest knowing the challenges ahead. In doing so, players like  ,  , Mayank Agarwal and some others could be given an opportunity.
