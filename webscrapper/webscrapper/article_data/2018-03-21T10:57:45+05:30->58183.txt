PANAJI: A letter   has been filed before the high court of   at Goa seeking imposition of compensatory costs on organisers of the demonstration by mining dependants in   on Monday.

 The petition stated that, in accordance with the 1998 directions of the  , organisers of the protest meeting held in Panaji be made to pay compensatory costs for the massive police force deployed and for the loss, destruction and damage caused to property.
 
 Advocate  , in his letter petition, has urged the court to take suo motu cognisance of the events of March 19. The petition has sought a direction to chief secretary, North Goa collector and director general of police (DGP) to explain as to how such mockery of the law and holding of the state to ransom was permitted. Stating that the events that unfolded in Panaji would make it one of the darkest days in Goaâ€™s history, Rodrigues in his petition stated that despite prohibitory orders under Section 144 being in place, law enforcement authorities chose to be mere bystanders, while thousands of innocent citizens were stranded for hours together and, more importantly, hundreds of school students were left in the lurch. 
 
 Pointing out that it was a clear case of total collapse of the administration with governance having gone for a toss, Rodrigues stated that the entire capital city was brought to a grinding halt with nothing done to prevent the blockade while the city was held to ransom. Rodrigues alleged that the chief secretary, North Goa collector and DGP were responsible for the fiasco as they were fully aware that such a situation was likely to arise, but took no preventive measures to block the protesters from travelling into Panaji. 
 
 Thousands of students, tourists, office-goers and others were all inconvenienced, the petition stated.
