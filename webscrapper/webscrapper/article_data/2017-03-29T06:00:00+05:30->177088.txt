Vaisakham’s music that was launched in the city has already garnered rave reviews from fans and critics alike, thanks to N Vasanth Kumar’s refreshing tunes. Vasanth, who has scored for films like Sudigadu, Speedunnodu and Gunturodu, admits that his approach for   was a bit unique. “I completely focussed on getting the songs to resonate with the story of the film, which, as I see it, is a romance with a subtle social message. So the songs and background music also reflect that mixture of melody as well as intensity,” explains Vasanth. 
His personal favourite among all tracks, however, is the title track. 
 He shares, “My favourite is the title track because it has a haunting melody. In fact, that’s the reason the hook of the song is used many times throughout the film.”
 Although Vasanth’s repertoire has largely been on the beat-heavy side, it was the film that required the composer to explore the melodious side. The director of the film   elaborates, “I strongly believe that songs should match the story of the film. And Vasanth was understanding of that and has created a beautiful album. He added melody to his beats, and created unique sounds. I think the outcome has been great.”
