Jaipur: The city was surprised by a flash mob on Monday as college students came together at Gaurav Tower as part of a series of events planned to evoke a sense of giving and spreading the smile.

 Students from various colleges gathered at the venue and on cue stood frozen in a position, attracting a crowd.
 
 Earlier in the day, the artists’ community from different fields performed at slums, old age homes and other children’s organizations to sensitize those neglected by the society towards art forms.
 
 Among other activities held was ‘Gift A Frame’ by photographers who clicked family portraits of people living in various slums.
 
 “The frames were gifted to families. This is a luxury which they can’t afford. This was followed by a day of smiling selfies where volunteers from Kalaa Kartavya clicked selfies with strangers spreading smiles in the world of technology where we are generally trapped in the zone of emotionless emoticons and meaningless LOLs,” said Vishvajeet Singh, director, Kalaa Kartavya, which organised the event.
 
 They also gifted sandwiches made by volunteers of different organizations to cops, ATM guards and sweepers with the aim of communicating with people from all walks of life.
