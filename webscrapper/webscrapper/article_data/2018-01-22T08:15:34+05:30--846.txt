PANAJI: Goan   and a few forest officials tramping around the bigger wetlands in North Goa on their annual water fowl count have something to rejoice after a long time – the sighting of rarely seen black-legged Kittiwake.

 This seabird species from the gull is not a regular visitor to India and hardly eight sightings have been reported so far. During the last few days, the little gull has been spotted by some birders at the Morjim sandbank.
 
 “A few persons have seen it,” a source from Goa   Conservation Network ( ) said, but declined to provide more details.
 
 
  
 
 A group of birders on their annual water fowl count to Carambolim, Navelim and other water bodies also visited Morjim, but the rare visitor could not be spotted on Sunday, sources said.
 
 Though there is speculation that this may be the first record of the kittiwake, Abhishek Jamalabad, an independent marine biologist said it had been spotted in the past in Goa.
 
 “Goa, however, has seen a kittiwake for three consecutive years now with this sighting, and additionally, it is possible that a number of older ‘little gull’ records could actually have been kittiwakes,” Jamalabad stated in his post on  .
 
 GBCN has been involved in the annual exercise in wetlands and often new records have livened up the count.
 
  On February 13, 2016, three local birders Justino Rebello, Manoj Sankav and Mangrish Dharwardkar had a cause for celebration, as they had sighted and photographed a Falcated Duck, in Ambulor lake, Verna.
 
 Sighting of unusual and rare sightings happen randomly, but for some time, the birders had nothing much to be excited about. Many birders would be keen to spot the kittiwake in Morjim.
 
 “As one might guess from its appearance, the kittiwake is a kind of gull. Like many of its cousins, it is an amusing bird to watch, its short legs giving it a funny waddling gait at which I laughed out rudely,” he said in his post.
