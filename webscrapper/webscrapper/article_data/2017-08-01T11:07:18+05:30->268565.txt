COIMBATORE: NGOs and environmentalists heaved a sigh of relief as the Coimbatore corporation cancelled the contract for the model road project to save the trees on D B Road at R S Puram. With more than 200 trees facing the axe and NGOs up in arms against the move, a decision has been taken to save trees. 

 “We have given 45 days to the architects to plan and hire various consultants to resolve issues in departments such as plumbing, telecommunication cables and to save the trees,” said corporation commissioner  . Other smart roads such as Race Course Road and   are also being designed, he added. “We will call for tenders for these projects also together.” 
 
 The ambitious smart road project, estimated to cost Rs 5.5crore, was already stuck in a limbo for more than six months due to design disagreements with   and other departments. Later, when those issues were resolved, environmentalists objected to the fact that more than 200 trees were to be cut for the project. As per a survey done by  , there were 133 trees on TV   Road and 92 trees on DB Road. Of these, three trees have already been felled when the trenches were dug.
 
 Environmentalists from NGOs such as Osai said they welcomed the decision. “While we welcome developmental works, we do not want to lose fully grown trees. Moreover, these trees are an identity for the D B Road and T V Samy road. The roads are wide enough and trees should not be cut down. We are happy that the corporation has taken the decision to save the trees,” said Syed of Osai.
 
 The officials said the street design had to be improved and the architects will employ specified consultants for various aspects such as plumbing, electrical cables and telecommunication cables. “We will complete the design on NSR Road, Masakkali Palayam, Sanganoor Road and Race Course Circle and start the tender process together,” added the official.
