 Chairman of the BBMP standing committee on taxation and finance,   told TOI that   would be penalised heavily. “Starting next week, we will take up total station survey – carried out with electronic equipment – and manual inspection of properties across the city.

 On December 14, 2016, BBMP issued a notification wherein the body gave owners a month’s time to submit the exact details of their property, and subsequently pay the right amount of tax. Taking cognisance of discrepancies in the information provided by owners under the self-assessment scheme, BBMP gave residents a window to come forward and file revised returns. But very few owners appear to have utilised this facility.
 
 Gunashekar said, “Violations include getting the property tax zone wrong, erroneous entries pertaining to the extent of built-up area such as number of floors, among others. There are also cases of some commercial properties that are equipped with aircondition facility – property tax is greater for these – that have declared themselves as non-AC properties.”
 
 The BBMP is likely to resurvey nearly 75 tech parks, besides malls and 5,000 industries first, sources in the civic body said. “We have learnt that many big establishments have furnished false information to reduce the value of property tax. Independent houses and smaller commercial establishments will be dealt with later,” a senior official with the BBMP’s revenue wing said.
