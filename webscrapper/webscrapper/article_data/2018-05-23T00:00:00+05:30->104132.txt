It was recently announced that   will be playing the lead in Muthaiya’s next, titled  . The director tells us that the film will be set in Madurai and feature the folk art form predominantly.

 The director says, “The script is nearing completion and we hope to start shooting by mid-June. Devarattam is a traditional folk art, and is very popular in villages. While the film is not about devarattam, the folk art is intrinsic to the script.”
 
 While   is known for his rural subjects, like Kutti Puli, Komban, Marudhu and Kodiveeran, this film marks Gautham’s return to the genre, after Muthuramalingam. “I wanted to do a city-based film, but the producers thought I should do another ‘nativity’ film. We have a strong team — cinematographer Sakthi Saravanan, composer  , editor Pradeep and art director Veeramani. While Soori is on board, we are finalising the rest of the cast, including the heroine,” Muthaiya signs off.
