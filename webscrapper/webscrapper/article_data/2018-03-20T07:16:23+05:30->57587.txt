LUCKNOW: Taking a jibe at BJP’s claims of setting new benchmarks in the first year of Yogi government’s rule,   on Monday accused the state government of only misleading people by re-inaugurating projects that were already inaugurated in the previous regime led by   as chief minister.

 The party said that the first year of BJP government has been a total failure on all fronts. “BJP government in the state re-inaugurated Lucknow-Agra Expressway that our government had built in record time. 
  
 
 They showcased it as their project ahead of the Investors’ Summit to lure investments which are still on paper,” said former CM and   Akhilesh Yadav. “We launched free ambulance service for the poor and needy, Dial 100 for police intervention and crime control, we connected all district headquarters with four-lane roads,” he said while adding that the present government cannot boast of a single scheme or project that they have had launched for the welfare of people.
 
 “They promised to double farmers’ income but had not prepared a roadmap for it. They promised farm loan waiver for 86 lakh farmers but allocated small fund for it,” said Akhilesh, adding that unemployed youths are still looking for jobs while Samajwadi government had created 10 lakh jobs in five years.
 
 Akhilesh posted a tweet saying, “People have got together and given a befitting reply to those who promoted ‘vaimanasya’ (animosity) instead of ‘vikas’ (development),” apparently referring to the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok   loss of BJP.
