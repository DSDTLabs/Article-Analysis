Panaji: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s diktat to his party colleagues asking them not to publicly speak out about the drug menace offered the Congress an opportunity to attack Parrikar. Expressing surprise over Parrikar’s move, Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president Shantaram Naik alleged on Wednesday that Parrikar was trying to censor his own party MLAs.

 “The chief minister writing the letter is yet another example of fascism that BJP government in Goa seeks to implement through the back door,” Naik said.
 
 The Congress leader said that policemen should be encouraged to raid the dens of drug peddlers as they are a menace to the society but wondered why Parrikar was restraining his party MLAs from criticizing police for their inability to curb drugs trade.
 
 The former MP’s views found an echo in Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginald Lourenco who said that Parrikar’s letter showed that the intelligence wing of the Goa police had completely failed. “The chief minister’s letter to the MLAs has shown that there is complete failure on the part of the police intelligence on drugs. Now, the onus is on the police to come out and state whether they are made completely incompetent by the BJP-led government or whether the police has failed,” Lourenco said. “Will know who is lying”, he added
 
 The Congress said that when he used to slam the police in the past, Parrikar had no concern for the morale of Goa police force for whom he is now shedding crocodile tears. He said perhaps the trigger for the CM to write the letter is WRD minister Vinod Palyekar’s statement that he was receiving threats from drug mafia for trying to clear Siolim constituency of drugs. 
 
 “If you are sincere, launch a war against drugs. Why should you put restrictions on the MLAs and ministers,” Lourenco said.
