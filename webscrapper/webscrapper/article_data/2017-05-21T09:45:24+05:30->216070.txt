HYDERABAD: The Telangana State Women's Commission has sought a pre-nuptial agreement in the case of   marriages. The agreement says that the couple will abide by the Indian laws in case of a marital dispute. As complaints of   being deserted and divorced by men employed overseas are increasing by the day , the Commission has come up with several suggestions to bind over unscrupulous husbands.Women's Commission chairperson   said that many women are being forcibly sent back by their husbands or held to ransom for dowry .Many men are taking advantage of lenient laws in other nations to obtain exparte divorces from overseas court and deny maintenance to women they have deserted in India. “Though pre-nuptial agreement may not have any place in legislations of other nations, women can benefit from the agreement in local courts,“ she said.

 The Commission also wanted treaties to be made at international level between nations so that exploited women are not rendered helpless due to local legislations.
 
 It recommended that the re should be a provision that passports of married men should have all the details like address and the name of spouse. Many men are also escaping by false information. This will be useful as many victims complained that they have found that their husbands were either already married in a foreign country or gave false information about their jobs and immigration status.
 
 There are also several cases where women weren't picked up at the airport upon arrival in a foreign country .“In a particular case, a man obtained divorce from his wife whom he deserted in India, using the local laws in US. He also made sure that his wife pay 70 dollars for taking care of children. He obtained the custody of the children,“ she said.
 
 The complaints are received mostly from Indian women married to men residing in countries like the USA, the UK, Australia, Thailand and UAE.
