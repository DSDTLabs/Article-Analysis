VISAKHAPATNAM: The   (VMR) is likely to have as many as 98 coaches against Vijayawada’s 54, official sources in the   Corporation Limited (AMRC) said. 

 With a length of 22 metres and width of 2.9 metres, each coach will have a maximum passenger carrying capacity of 275 people. Each train will have three such coaches. The VMR will have one station per kilometre. Each train will move from one station to another within a minute, according to the   and estimates of the VMR project.
 
 According to the sources, the metro train coaches are likely to be procured from one of the three proposed coach   — Sri City in Chittoor, Salvi in Gujarat and  .
 
 “Procurement of bogies is not the direct job of AMRC in the case of Vizag Metro Rail as it is a public private partnership (PPP) project. Our role is to provide land for the project to the private partner who can take care of the procurement of the coaches. AMRC will oversee the project on behalf of the government. However, it is too early to talk on the coaches as the project is still waiting for an official confirmation from the Union government,” the sources told TOI.
 
 Meanwhile, existing transport stakeholders like APSRTC said the metro rail would eat into the revenue of the RTC, but will decongest public transportation. Ch Appalanarayana, deputy traffic manager for APSRTC at Dwaraka Bus Station, said each metro is equal to nearly six city buses. Each city bus can carry a maximum of 60 passengers.
 
 “Our city bus takes nearly two and half minutes to cover one kilometre in the city limits whereas the metro train can cover it within one minute. So, the metro train is far better than the RTC buses in services, but we have our own passengers who will not be able to avail the services of the metro,” Appalanarayana told TOI.
