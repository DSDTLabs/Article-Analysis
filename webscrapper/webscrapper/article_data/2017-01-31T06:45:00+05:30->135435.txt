BHATINDA: A day after SAD chief   claimed that AAP supremo   spent the night at the residence of a “former terrorist”, the Delhi CM’s party colleague Sanjay Singh on Monday said the man who the Punjab deputy CM had called a terrorist was a citizen of the UK and had been acquitted in a case registered against him falsely.

 He termed the Punjab deputy CM’s allegations as “imaginary, false, and motivated”. Sukhbir had said on Sunday that Kejriwal spent Saturday night at the residence of former terrorist Gurinder Singh in Teacher Colony, Moga. Sanjay, who is AAP’s Punjab affairs in charge, said in Moga that Sukhbir had found an “easy escape route from his misdeeds” by naming everybody who questioned him as a terrorist or a supporter of radicals and anti-national elements.
 
 Sanjay said a local station house officer (SHO) and a joint commissioner of Moga municipal corporation were already staying in the same house. “The house is in the name of Karanjit Kaur, wife of Gurinder, a citizen of UK. He was falsely booked in a case when he was not even in India. He was later acquitted by court,” he said.
 
 He said Kejriwal had stayed at the house on the request of an NRI, Tarsem Singh, who had come to Punjab to campaign in favour of AAP. “The minute-to-minute programme of Kejriwal, including his night stay were sent to Punjab Police and its intelligence wing beforehand; this is a set procedure for the visit of a chief minister,” said Sanjay.
 
 Sanjay said Sukhbir had earlier alleged that Kejriwal had met R P Singh, head of Akhand Kirtani Jatha, which in his eyes was a terror outfit. He said Punjab CM   had held official meeting with   to discuss Sikh issues. “Let Sukhbir register an FIR against his father for maintaining relations with terrorists. Even declassified files of US agency CIA had exposed Badal’s links with extremists during the dark days of militancy in Punjab,” he said.
