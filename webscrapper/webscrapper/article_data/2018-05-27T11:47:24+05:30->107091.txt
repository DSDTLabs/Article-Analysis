PUNE: The next time you visit a   shop, better buy a water bottle and the essential snacks from elsewhere.

 The excise department has banned liquor stores from selling accompaniments to liquor, including soft drinks, water bottles and packets of snacks. An excise department official told TOI that according to the old Bombay Foreign Liquor Rules, 1953, liquor stores can sell nothing except alcohol, but the shops were still selling them.
 
 “After the ban on liquor brands’ advertisements at stores, the authorities decided to implement the rule prohibiting the sale of anything at the licensed premise except liquor,” the official said.
 
 A liquor shop owner said accompaniments were sold to customers as an add-on service to make the proposition of buying liquor more service-oriented. “ Now customers will have to go from one shop to another to collect the items they need. Earlier, they would get everything required from one shop,” he said.
 
 “Water has been sold alongside liquor for years — it is something that naturally goes with liquor. However, the age-old rules say that nothing else can be sold at the licensed premise except liquor, which the excise department has now decided to implement,” another liquor store owner said.
 
 “The rules were framed in the 1970s, when drinking was a social taboo. If these and many other redundant rules are not amended or scrapped, then days are not far when one will have to apply in writing to buy liquor,” he added.
