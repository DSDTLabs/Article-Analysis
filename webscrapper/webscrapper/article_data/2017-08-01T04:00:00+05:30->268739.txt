Vadodara: Just days after a man allegedly stalked a girl student of M S Universityâ€™s Institute of Fashion Technology for nearly one kilometre, another incident has brought to forth the need of stricter vigilance at the campus. 

 Sources suggest that despite ban on entry of males inside the girls hostel premises, a youth recently managed to enter the girls hostel at the time of roll call. 
 
 The youth entered the girls hostel premises under the pretext that he was brother of a girl student. Later, when girls denied that they had any relation with the youth, the youth entered into heated arguments with the warden of the hall and also the security personnel, present at the spot. 
 
 Sources suggest that the youth, who is a student of the Faculty of Family and Community Sciences, even started claiming that he is close to registrar Neerja Jaiswal, who is head of the Department of Family and Community Resource Management. 
 
 Officials however ruled out any relation of the youth with Jaiswal. After security personnel nabbed him, he tendered apology and was allowed to go. TNN
