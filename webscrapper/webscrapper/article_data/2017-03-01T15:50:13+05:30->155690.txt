Pune:   launched its 4G services in the city on Tuesday.

 “Vodafone is expanding its (4G) services to Pune and will roll out (services) in other important locations by March 2017,” Ashish Chandra, business head, Maharashtra and Goa circle,   India, said. In a presentation, he said, the company aims to offer 4G in 2,400 towns across the country by March this year.
 
 The move follows its rival   announcing roll out of its 4G services in 400 towns in Maharashtra and Goa circle about a fortnight ago. New entrant Reliance Jio had also launched its pan   4G service in September last year and to acquire more customers, the company offered its services free for three months, which was extended to a further three-month period.
 
 Vodafone India said it has invested Rs 248 crore in the first half of financial year 2017-18 (till September 30, 2016) to “expand network (towers and fibre optic networks) in Maharashtra and Goa circle.”
 
 Vodafone said it will be offering its 4G service in the 2,100 MHz spectrum band. Earlier Airtel had said it will offer the same in 1,800 MHz spectrum band. Both players claim that respective bands are best suited to offer high quality data and voice services.
 
 “We are offering small data packs to make it lucrative for the rural consumer to use data,” Chandra said. The company has designed a miniaturised data pack that will offer 30MB of data for as low as Rs 8.
 
 Despite the 4G launch (which is suppose to offer high data speeds), the average data speed remains quite low at sub 10MBPS for all operators.
 
 Asked, why the companies do not commit to a minimum data speed despite the huge investments in network and spectrum, Chandra said, “It is difficult as the speed depends on a lot of factors like tele-density, congestion, among other things. Fresh investments in the network expansion should help improve speeds.”
