LUCKNOW: Prepare to face blocked roundabouts in city till March 20 as Lucknow Municipal Corporation has denied to remove burnt wood of the   from roads for next eight days citing religious reasons. To add to the woes, many of LMC’s sanitary staff have gone on long   reducing hope of residents to see heaps of ash and burnt wood removed from crossings this week. 

 LMC’s health officer P K Singh said, “It is the general belief that   is observed for eight days past Holi and before that we can’t remove the half burnt logs and people should pass by them carefully.” On Tuesday, commuters at many places faced problem at several crossings. 
 
 Mahanagar resident Ginni Dixit said, “Large wooden logs are lying right in the middle of the road near the busy Sant Market, between Wireless and Chhannilal crossings. The roadsides have already been dug up for laying interlocking tiles. This leaves virtually no space for commuters to cross the road. I somehow managed to cross that point but was blocked again by heaps of construction material lying on the sides.”
 
 Apart from causing inconvenience, the burnt wood is also obstructing vision causing people to bump into each other’s vehicles. A resident, Radha said, “There was a huge jam in Aminabad market as the wooden logs had occupied most space. I saw bikes bumping into each other and cyclists getting hurt while crossing the area.” 
 
 Wooden planks and logs have occupied the entire crossing area leaving no space for people to move at several places like Gokhale Marg crossing, various spots in Janakipuram Phase-I, Vikasnagar trisection, Capper Road near Lalbagh, Kaiserbagh, Dalibagh crossing near DGP office, etc. 
 
 Ritu Singh of Kaiserbagh said LMC should at least try to remove blockage from centre and keep it on sides so that people don’t face problems for next one week. LMC, however, refused to do so claiming that location of burnt woods should not be changed.
