BATHINDA:   have withdrawn their 12-day strike on Sunday after a case under the SC/ST (prevention of atrocities) act was registered against RTI activist   of Moga on Saturday following investigations for over two months. A complaint against Sood was made by sanitation workers of Moga municipal corporation on February 16 for alleged casteist remarks. 

 “We were sitting in the Moga municipal corporation office on February 16 when Suresh Sood entered the office and allegedly used some casteist remarks against us and also abused us. We filed a complaint with the police but nothing was done for long time. We started a strike 12 days ago and held protest against the police and only after that the case has been registered. We are satisfied and have decided to resume work,” said municipal employees federation president Satpal Anjan and safai sewak union president Satpal Chavria. Meanwhile, Sood too had filed a complaint with the police against alleged employees’ misbehaviour with him.
 
 Sood had been in the eye of storm for putting up a lot of queries regarding sanitation workers and development works of the MC through RTI. Perturbed over this, sanitation workers a few months ago had dumped garbage in front of Sood’s residence and he had approached the Punjab and Haryana high court in this regard. A case for causing nuisance was registered against 36 sanitation workers.
 
 Sources said the corporation employees had been facing heat due to score of queries being put forward by Sood to extract various types of information and employees did not want this to be provided to him and took up the matter with sanitation workers, who went ahead with garbage dumping near his home. Sood said that he would approach court against the case registered against him. 
 
 Moga DSP city   said that, “The case under SC/ST prevention of atrocities act has been registered against Suresh Sood and police will investigate the matter before making any arrest.”
