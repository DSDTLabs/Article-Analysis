NEW DELHI: The Army is stepping up its synergy in operational logistics with the Indian Railways to ensure it can swiftly mobilize as well as switch forces between the western front with Pakistan and the eastern one with China much faster than what is possible now.

 The railways is already building infrastructure for military requirements at different places in the country. This includes construction of concrete ramps for loading of tanks, howitzers and infantry combat vehicles on special trains in areas like Bhalukpong in Arunachal Pradesh, Dimapur in Nagaland, Silapathar, Missamari and Murkongselek in Assam, with an eye firmly on China.
 
 “Concurrently, there is an increased focus on significantly enhancing the speed at which the special military trains run… trial runs are in progress. This will help in faster mobilization,” said an officer.
 
  
  
 
 One of the harsh lessons learnt during the 10-month forward troop deployment along the western front under ‘Operation Parakram’, launched after the Parliament attack in December 2001, was that slow mobilisation would not do.
 
 India had taken over a month to mobilize its forces for  , which had given enough time to the US-led international community to intervene as well as Pakistan to shore up its defences.
 
 Since then, the Army has adopted its  , also called the ‘Cold Start’ doctrine, to practice swift mobilization for multiple offensives into enemy territory.
 
  
  
 
 The Army, incidentally, uses 750-800 trains to relocate its battalions as well as move tanks, artillery, ammunition and other loads for exercises every year. “The Army pays railways around Rs 2,000 crore per year for this. For infrastructure development, the railways in some places in also using its own budget,” said another officer.
 
 The Army is also “tagging into” the railways’ online monitoring system to keep track of the 5,000 train wagons it owns.
