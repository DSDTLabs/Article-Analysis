Gurgaon: Two persons were arrested for allegedly duping a Sector 57 resident of over Rs 11 lakh on the pretext of promotion of a website. Neeraj Kumar and Naresh Kumar were produced in a city court, which remanded them in a two-day police custody on Wednesday. They posed as telecallers to dupe Lalit Sharma, the complainant.

 In his complaint lodged at Sector 57 police station in April, Lalit Sharma said he had received a call in January from a caller who identified himself as an employee of an online shopping website. He claimed that Lalit was chosen through a lucky draw and was entitled to a gift hamper that the company would be sending him shortly. Lalit was asked to pay Rs 2,499 on receiving the hamper that would contain a headphone, sunglasses and a wallet. 
 
 “When he got the items, he paid Rs 2,499. After a few days, Lalit received a call from one Niharika, who also claimed to be from the same company, informing him that another lucky draw was scheduled and if he participated, he could win a Baleno car, gold worth Rs 3.5 lakh, a Hunk motorcycle, an LED TV, a Laptop and a Samsung mobile,” Lalit told the police.
 
 He was asked to deposit Rs 20,000 to participate in the lucky draw. As it was a lucrative offer, Lalit deposited the amount. The demand did not stop here, Lalit received a number of calls from different ‘employees’ asking him to deposit money on some pretext or the other. Lalit ended up paying another Rs 11,00,000 in instalments. As time passed by, Lalit grew suspicious. When he tried to call the ‘employees’, they gave excuses over the delay and later switched off their phones.
