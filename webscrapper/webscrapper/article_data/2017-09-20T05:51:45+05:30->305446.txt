NOIDA: Licence-related work remained suspended at the   office in   as all the 21 clerks continued their strike for the second consecutive day on Tuesday in protest against an FIR lodged against three employees of the   office earlier this month.

 The employees, agitating under the banner of UP Parivahan Karamchari Sangh, however, called off the strike later in the evening and promised to resume work on Wednesday, providing a relief to commoners who had to face inconvenience for the last two days.
 
 The employees of the transport department had gone on the strike after a journalist filed a police complaint against three of their colleagues in Lucknow for allegedly beating him up.
 
 But the employees’ union, who had threatened to continue the strike for a week, decided “to suspend the protest” for a week following a meeting with the principal secretary (home) in Lucknow in the evening. The union members claimed that the principal secretary had promised that the three employees would not face any harassment and that the “fake” case would be withdrawn if found untrue.
 
 “The principal secretary (home) has told union’s regional president Hari Kishore Tiwari and regional general secretary Shivbaran Yadav that no employee will be harassed and fake cases will be withdrawn. Transport commissioner G Guru Prasad and additional transport commissioner (administration) Mangala Prasad Singh have also promised that no such action will be taken that may tantamount to harassment of any employee,” a letter from union’s general secretary Jaydeep Chaudhary to all the district-level units read.
 
 Employees at Lucknow and Kanpur had also been on strike for the last six days, demanding withdrawing of the FIR.
