LUCKNOW: Policemen should first wear helmets themselves and then check us, said   at a petrol pump near Koneshwar crossing in Chowk on Tuesday. He had come to refill his motorcycle, when TOI asked him if he was asked for a helmet by the fuel station workers or policemen. He wasn’t. 

 On Saturday, there were no policemen at many of the fuel stations that TOI visited to enforce the ‘no helmet no fuel’ campaign. When workers saw TOI lensmen clicking pictures, they started lending helmets to their customers.
 
 The ‘no helmet no fuel’ drive was initiated by Lucknow police on May 22. It has come to a halt within a week. Many people are not even aware of the rule. Fuel station workers say they are not authorised to enforce the law. 
 
 At 1pm, people at a gas station on MG Marg were easily getting fuel without helmets. Jai Kishan, a customer, said, “Why should I wear a helmet if I am not able to speed because of traffic.”
 
 Ashish, a worker said, “It’s not our job to bar our customers from taking fuel.”
 
 Meanwhile, a person getting fuel at the same petrol pump without helmet threatened TOI lensman for clicking his photograph.
 
 The same happened at a petrol pump on   at 1.30pm. Workers started giving helmets from the pump office to their customers.  , an advocate, said, “My helmet has been stolen. If police get me the one, I will wear it.” There was no policeman at the fuel station.
 
 Around 3pm at the petrol pump near 1090 crossing, TOI asked workers on what they were doing to enforce the ‘no helmet no petrol’ rule. “We are not authorised to deny any customer or educate them for helmet or any law,” said Sanjay, a worker. 
 
 At this pump too, there was no policeman.
