MUMBAI: The government has decided to redevelop 13   transport (ST) bus depots to give them a new look and make them passenger friendly.

He will have to maintain the depot for 30 years. Tenders for the development of 9 depots have been floated. “Thecondition of depots today is very bad, we want to make them passenger friendly with all the facilities under one roof,” said transport minister Diwakar Raote.
 
 Shashi Prabhu and associates has been named as the architect for the project. 
 
 In Panvel, there will be a skywalk connecting the depot to the railway station. Facilities like parking lots, food courts, dedicated auto and taxi stands are also being planned,” an official said.
