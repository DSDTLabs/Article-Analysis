JAMSHEDPUR: A 39-year-old entrepreneur poisoned his 35-year-old wife and six-year-old son before hanging himself from the ceiling fan in   in Baridih under   on Tuesday. 

 In his suicide note, Nishant Vaibhav, proprietor of Taranand Engineering Services, has held no one responsible. "The victim has mentioned that he is fed up with his life and is hence ending it. He has also written that life has become painful for him," said Birsanagar police station in-charge U N Singh.
 
 Police said there's no clue as to why Nishant poisoned his wife and son and ended his life abruptly. The cops have also recovered a piece of chocolate found at the spot for forensic examination to know whether it contained any poisonous substance. Nishant's mother stays with her elder son in a separate flat in the same building and like everyday, on Tuesday she visited her younger son's house in the early hours but was shocked to find the doors open. On entering, she found her daughter in-law and grandson lying unconscious and his son hanging from a fan in a separate room. She raised an alarm, following which, other members of the family arrived and later police were informed.
 
 Ironically, the tragic end of the three-member family comes on a day when Nishant and Purnima were to celebrate their 8th marriage anniversary. The locals have told the police that the family was friendly and courteous and never did they show signs of any trouble in their life.
