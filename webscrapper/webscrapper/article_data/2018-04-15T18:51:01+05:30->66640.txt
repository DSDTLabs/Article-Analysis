 and   starrer ‘
 ’ got off to a super start on Friday with an opening collection of Rs 25 crore. The film continued its momentum by registering a massive Rs 20.5 crore on Saturday, reported BoxOfficeIndia.com. This takes its two day total to Rs 45.50 crore and it is already the second highest grossing weekend of 2018 for a film in just two days after ‘Padmaavat’.

 
  
 ‘Baaghi 2’ witnessed a slight drop from its Friday collections, but the slide can be directly attributed to the fact that the first day was a national holiday as opposed to Saturday. The film can easily make up this drop and more on Sunday if the audience turn-out is like that of the first day.
 
 In some cinemas in the regions of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, ‘Baaghi 2’ has reportedly set all-time records and this includes beating the collection of ‘Baahubali 2: The Conclusion’ which shows how well the film has performed in these places initially.
 
 
 
 The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ‘Baaghi’ and is a remake of 2016 Telugu movie ‘Kshanam’. More than a month before the release of ‘Baaghi 2’, on 19 February 2018, the third installment of the film was announced under the title of ‘Baaghi 3’. The sequel will retain the trio of producer  , director  , and Tiger Shroff starring in the lead role. The team will start shooting in December 2018.
 
 
 
 Along with Tiger and Disha, ‘Baaghi 2’ also stars Manoj Bajpayee, Prateik Babbar, Randeep Hooda and   in a cameo appearance in the remake of Madhuri Dixit’s hit number ‘Ek Do Teen’. The film also features the rehashed version of the world-famous Punjabi song ‘Mundiyan To Bach Ke Rahi’.
