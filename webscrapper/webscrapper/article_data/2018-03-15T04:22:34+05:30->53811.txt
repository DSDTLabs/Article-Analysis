MUMBAI: The state is in the process of setting up its own MH   agency which will play a role in quelling rumours on social media, minister of state for home Ranjit Patil told the state council on Wednesday.

 This will be similar to the Centre’s   Emergency Response   (CERT). “Currently we have to get in touch with CERT to block rumours on social media. Soon we will be able to do this from within the state,” Patil said. A sum of Rs 650 crore has been allocated for the project, he said. Price Waterhouse Coopers has been appointed consultant for it, said Patil.
 
 He said the Maharashtra   Security project was being set up. Under it, 47 cyber labs were being set up in districts and 138 officials had been trained.
 
 Patil admitted that the conviction rate for cyber offences was low. In 2017, 4,035 cases had been registered, of which 1,037 had been detected, a conviction rate of 16.67%.
