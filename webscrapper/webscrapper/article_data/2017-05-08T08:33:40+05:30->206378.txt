JAIPUR:   of   on Sunday   to protest against the killing of two youths who were shot down by three   on Saturday night. 

 A senior official of the district police said that Mukesh Gujar, resident of Haryana, and Jaipal, were shot dead by three assailants when they were standing near a busy market in Singhana area of Jhunjhunu. 
 
 "Mukesh was a resident of neighbouring Naya village in Haryana and had come to meet his relative in Rajasthan. Late on Saturday night three bike-borne assailants fired at the duo from close range, Mukesh and Jaipal were rushed to the hospital where they were declared brought dead by the doctors," a police official said.
 
 "The location of the attack was Damoli village, preliminary investigation suggests that attackers had been following the movement of Mukesh since long time. As soon as Mukesh entered the village, the trio fired shots at him," the police official said, adding that assailants had come to kill Mukesh, but a bullet missed the target and hit Jaipal's head.
