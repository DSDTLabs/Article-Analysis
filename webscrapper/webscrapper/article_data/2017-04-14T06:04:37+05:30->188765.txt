THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a bid to give more teeth to the   of the government, the   (SJD) plans to set up full-fledged five   (OSCs) on an immediate basis. It also plans to constitute emergency response teams in all districts for distressed children and women. 

 Social justice minister   said the Centre has given the nod to set up nine more OSCs in nine districts. This is in addition to the previously-approved five OSCs.
 
 According to an SJD official, the existing one-stop crisis management centres (OCMC) under the health department were crisis-ridden, due to shortage of counsellors, doctors and proper legal support. "Even on March 8 (Women's Day), a teen rape survivor had to face insensitive remarks of doctor and paramedics at an OCMC attached to a hospital," the official, who expressed hope that the newly-proposed cells would be survivor-friendly. SJD director TV Anupama said the five OSCs would be set up with Rs 44 lakh central fund in Thiruvananthapuram, Malappuram, Kannur, Thrissur and Wayanad. 
 
 The work has begun, she confirmed adding that, "Now that we received the approval to set up nine more cells, we have to send a detailed proposal on the land allotted with other details as per the central guidelines to get the funds."
 
 The OSCs will also have temporary rehabilitation shelters for survivors. On the emergency response teams, she said a committee -with an SJD official, child protection official, police, medical, legal and administrative officers as its members -would be constituted in each district.
 
  As per the Union ministry of women and child development guidelines, the OSCs will be housed in a two-storeyed building of 300 sqm and carpet area of 132 sqm.
