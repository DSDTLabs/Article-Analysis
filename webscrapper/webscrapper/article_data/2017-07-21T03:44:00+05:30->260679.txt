Panaji: Grounded casino vessel MV Lucky Seven at Miramar beach is leading up to a River Princess-like fiasco, activists and citizens said on Wednesday, even as they demanded that those responsible for it should be penalised to prevent the recurrence of such episodes.

 Citizens’ group Aaam Aurat Admi Against Gambling (AAAAG), blamed the government for endangering the environment by permitting the casino vessel’s entry into River Mandovi when it was clearly prohibited.
 
 The group appealed to the high court of Bombay at Goa to take suo motu cognisance of the grounded vessel, which, it said, threatened to damage public property and the environment, and risk lives.
 
 “Crores of public money was spent to remove River Princess, which eroded the (Candolim) beach and caused huge environmental damage,” the group stated.
 
 Srinivas Kamat, a citizen, alleged that the removal of 12,000 litres of fuel from the ship during inclement weather could raise risks of an oil spill on Miramar beach.
