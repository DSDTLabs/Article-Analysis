 2, starring   in the lead as a khaki-clad cop, and produced by Shankar Gowda, Vinod Gowda and  , goes on floors this week. Interestingly, it will see producer   in the director’s chair. “Initially, we thought that adman   would direct the film, but he’s working on another one of our projects. Considering that this film is based on my script, we thought that it is only apt that I direct, as I am the best person to bring my vision to the big screen,” says Shankar.
The film will also introduce Mumbai-based debutante   to   cinema. “We auditioned close to 100 girls for the lead role in Kempegowda 2. Niva came to us through a casting co-ordinator and during her screen test, which included her enacting scenes to depict three different emotions and a bit of dance, she really impressed us, and that’s how we decided to cast her,” explains the director, adding that the actress is currently learning Kannada in preparation for the role.
 Model-turned-actress Niva, meanwhile, says that the production house’s track record and the script of Kempegowda 2 is what drew her to Sandalwood. “I am quite excited to be making my filmi debut with this project. I play a modern girl from an ultra-rich family, who comes in contact with the hero, Komal, owing to certain circumstances. How he goes about solving that forms a part of the story,” she says.
