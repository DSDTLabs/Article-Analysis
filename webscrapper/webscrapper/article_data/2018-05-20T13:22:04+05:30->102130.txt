RAJKOT: In yet another incident, a rabid fox attacked three persons in   village of Una taluka in Gir-Somnath district on Saturday. This is the second such incident in three days. On Wednesday, a fox had attacked five persons, including a minor, in the same village and later died.

 Forest officials suspect that some of the foxes in the area have been infected with some virus that they might have got through food. This was the reason why they were turning rabid.
 
 The fox attacked the three persons when they visited their orchard in   area of Sankhada village in the wee hours of Saturday. Forest officials said that the fox bit the victims on their limbs and back. 
 
 The victims are identified as   (80), Sajuben Surabhai Darbar (30) and Janakben Surabhai Darbar (20). They were taken to Una government hospital but as the hospital didn’t have stock of the rabies vaccine the injured were shifted to   civil hospital.
 
 Jasadhar Range Forest Officer (RFO) J G   said, “Generally, fox don’t attack humans but this one was rabid and seems to have been infected with some virus. That is the reason they are attacking humans.”
 
 Pandya said that the same fox had attacked five buffaloes owned by Popatbhai Bhupatbhai Gohil in the village. 
 
 According to sources, a buffalo carcass was buried outside the village a few days ago. Some foxes and dogs had preyed on the dead buffalo which could have caused the infection in foxes, added sources.
