HYDERABAD: Telangana   ( ) vice-president   on Friday alleged that chief minister   is pushing “revenue surplus“ Telangana into a deficit state.

 He warned that if the state government did not mend its ways, Telangana will soon join the rank of `Bimaaru sta tes'. Addressing media here, Ravi said the state government had borrowed `1,20,000 crore. “It needs to spend `7,700 crore this year on debt servicing alone. The state was surplus in revenue, but KCR had pushed it into a debt trap by resorting to borrowings,“ Ravi alleged. He said the state is faced with a severe financial crisis. “The financial pro blems are due to wrong planning and ill-conceived programmes,“ he said. In a separate press conference, TDP working president A Revanth Reddy pointed that while 17 chief ministers had raised 60,000 crore loan over a period of 20 years, the TRS government under the leadership of KCR had raised the same loan amount in just two years.
