DHARAMSHALA: BJP leader   hit out at   minister Sudhir Sharma, also a close aide of chief minister   on his frequent foreign trips in the name of   projects and making fake announcements about mono rail, IT Park and   

 Kapoor at a press conference in party office alleged while the town was struggling to settle municipal issues, the minister was busy making fake announcements. “There are major issues related to water and garbage to be sorted out. Rather than settling those, the minister is making announcements. It has been five years now. Where is the mono rail, central university and IT park as promised during elections by minister?” he said.
 
 Lashing out at the minister for building a new house in Khaniayara area he said that it was the only project that materialized in the last five years. “Not even a single brick has been installed for the rope way project so far. And the government has failed to deposit Rs 186 crore for the smart city project,” he said. According to him, no progress had been made on the central university which was an election plank for the Congress. “Rather the minister has unnecessarily shifted the central university from Dharamshala to Jadrangal,” he said.
