KOCHI: The high court has restrained   for widening of the national highway on the  , without obtaining a mining permit. 

 A single bench of the court issued the order after considering a petition filed by Basheer Muhammed of Kallidukku near Pattikkad in Thrissur and two others who are residing near the work site. It was alleged by them that blasting operations for constructing the six-lane highway are shaking the very foundations of their houses, which are situated about 50 metres away.
 
 National Highways Authority of India ( ) had submitted to the court that blasting operations are permitted as per specifications issued by the Union ministry of shipping, road, transport, and highways. The pollution control board ( ) had submitted that its consent is required only for quarry operations.
 
 However, the court held that a mining permit is required as land is quarried and the subsoil and minerals are removed and permission from PCB is required in view of the effects of blasting. National development is of prime concern but it cannot be advanced by flouting the standards prescribed by various laws and putting the life and property of citizens at peril, the judgment stated.
