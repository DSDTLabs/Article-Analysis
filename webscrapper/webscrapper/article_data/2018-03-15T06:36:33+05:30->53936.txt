NEW DELHI: Since the Lok Sabha elections of 2014, there have been a total of 19 by-elections to Lok Sabha seats. In 12 of these, the party that won in the general elections retained the seat in the bypolls too. Thus, there have only been seven cases where the incumbent has lost. Alarmingly for the  , it has been the loser in six of these contests.

 
 
  
 
 The six seats that have gone out of the BJP’s tally over these nearly four years include   in Punjab, Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh, Ajmer and Alwar in Rajasthan — all lost to the Congress — and now the two seats in   lost to the SP.
 
 The only other party to have lost out in these by-elections has been the PDP, which lost the Srinagar seat to Farooq Abdullah of the National Conference, another case of the NDA suffering a loss.
 
 From the BJP’s point of view, it was the incumbent party in eight of the 19 contests. Of those, it managed to retain only two — Shahdol in MP and Vadodara, the prime minister’s seat, in  . Thus, it has lost three-fourths of the Lok Sabha bypolls in which the sitting MP belonged to the party.
 
 Apart from these losses, the BJP’s strength in the Lok Sabha — excluding nominated members but including the Speaker — has come down from 282 after the 2014 elections to 273 today, also because three of the five constituencies that remain vacant, Kairana in UP as well as Bhandara-Gondiya and Palghar in Maharashtra, had sitting BJP members. The bypolls to these are yet to be held.
