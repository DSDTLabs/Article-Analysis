NEW DELHI:   chief coach   today said the country's fast-improving cricket team is ready for Test status and will become a top-six side in another 2-3 years' time.

 "...Afghanistan is ready for   and our performances have shown it as we are winning consistently after I have taken over as head coach. We are waiting for the   meeting which will be held in April," Rajput told PTI.
 
 "We are all hopeful that Afghanistan get the Test status as we are ready for it. Afghanistan will become a force in Test cricket in the years to come. The way they are progressing, I believe they will come in the top-six in 2-3 years' time," he added.
 
 Afghanistan have come a long way since making their World T20 debut in 2010, having qualified for the last 50-over World Cup in Australia.
 
 They recently hammered   across the three formats (ODIs, T20 Internationals, First-Class) in a series played at their adopted home ground in Greater Noida.
 
 Rajput, who was manager of the Indian team when it won the inaugural World T20 in 2007, has been Afghanistan's head coach since June last year and considers the job his toughest challenge yet.
 
 "...and that is exactly the reason why I took it up. It is a life-changing experience for me as well, to work with guys who have risen after a lot of struggle and are committed to improve with every game."
 
 Rajput had replaced Pakistan great Inzamam-Ul-Haq for the coach's position. The 55-year-old knows that he has big shoes to fill but feels the journey has been satisfying so far.
