On Tuesday, the equity markets opened on a flat note as it looks to recover from the grasp of bearish sentiments which saw   lose more than 700 points in the two previous sessions.

 The 30-share BSE Sensex opened on 31,685.81, 59.18 points above the previous closing while the broader 50-share NSE   gained a minor 2.65 points to open on 9,875.25.
 
 However within 15 minutes of trading, both the benchmark indices had slipped into the red.
 
 At 12pm, Sensex was 129.39 points or 0.41 per cent down to 31,499.84 and Nifty was down 39.20 points or 0.40 per cent to 9,834.45.
 
 The markets have been in doldrums since last Monday as it saw the indices closing on lower levels for five consecutive sessions.
 
 Geopolitical tensions, a poor shape of macroeconomic data and an outflow of funds by Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) have together led to the slump in the markets.
 
 ONGC, IndiaBulls,   and PowerGrid were gaining the most in early trade while Asian Paints,   and Dr. Reddy's were the major losers.
