DUBAI: India's   and Poland's   rallied spiritedly in the super tie-break, winning eight of the last nine points, to make the title round of the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships on Friday. Bopanna, who started the season with a title at the Chennai Open and Matkowski, came through 6-3, 3-6, 10-6 against India's Leander Paes and Spain's   in 68-minutes.

 The Indo-Polish pairing started strongly, breaking the 43-year-old Kolkatan's serve in the fourth game on the deciding point with Bopanna's backhand doing the job for his team. Paes and Garcia-Lopez returned the favour in the second set, breaking Matkowski at 15 in the eighth game to push the match into the super tie-break.
 
 Paes, still a dominant figure at the net, helped his side take a 4-1 lead, getting ahead with two mini-breaks on Matkowski's serve. The Spaniard slammed a forehand down-the-line winner of a 151 kmph second serve on the fourth point and the Indian followed it up with a chipped return that left their opponents stranded on the fifth.
 
 Matkowski's lob on Paes' serve then stirred the turnaround for his side. The only point the Indo-Spanish pairing won after they levelled at fiveall was when the 36-year-old from Warsaw erred on his forehand. Bopanna then closed out the match on their second match point.
