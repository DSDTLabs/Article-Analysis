Chennai: Cadres, who thronged the AIADMK headquarters, were a disappointed lot to see an apology for a statue of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa being unveiled on her 70th birthday. Many cadres felt the statue does not look like Jayalalithaa and social media was flooded with comments on the statue, prompting fisheries minister D Jayakumar to slam the critics.

 The bronze statue of Jayalalithaa is slightly taller and wider than her mentor MG Ramachandran’s, located nearby.
 
 “Amma was fair in colour and had chubby cheeks. We were eagerly looking forward to see her statue. But this one has disappointed us. The face does not look like Amma’s at all,” said M Nagamani from Villupuram. With a grin, she threw flowers on the road and left in a huff.
 
 Ismail, a cab driver from North Chennai was more muted in his response. “It could have been better. It does not resemble her,” he said. A hashtag #Jayalalithaa statue in twitter evoked caustic comments about the statue. Memes circulated in Whatsapp too about the poor work of art.
