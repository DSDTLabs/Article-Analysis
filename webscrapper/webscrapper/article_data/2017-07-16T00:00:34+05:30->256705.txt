Kolhapur: The University Grants Commission ( ) on July 14, asked universities across the country to set up a National Academic Depository ( ) cell as soon as possible.

 The president of India launched NAD at a national convention â€” Digital Initiatives for Higher Education on July 9. The UGC has asked colleges and universities to establish a NAD cell and enter into service-level agreement with the depositories. 
 
 NAD will provide a digital or printed copy of the degree or academic award with security features to students or other authorised users. It will also verify academic awards online on the same day of request initiated by any authorised user.
 
 The depository will register educational institutions, boards or any eligibility assessment bodies, students and other users as well as verify entities like banks, employer companies, government agencies and academic institutions.
 
 NAD will maintain the authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of its database. It will also train and facilitate academic institutions, boards or eligibility assessment bodies to efficiently lodge academic awards in the database.
 
 Earlier this year, the Shivaji University, Kolhapur (SUK) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL) to set up the NAD cell.
 
 According to an SUK official, NAD would be an online storehouse of academic awards lodged by the academic institutions, boards or eligibility assessment bodies in a digital format. It will be available 24x7 online and shall help validate the authenticity of academic awards, their safe storage and easy retrieval.
 
 The UGC in an effort to create awareness of the NAD among the educational institutions had launched a series of country-wide awareness programs last month.
