TIRUNELVELI: The district administration has come up with a novel initiative to make the   more effective by sending the messages to the people, in the 125 vulnerable areas in the district, to their mobile phones. Those who have installed the ' ' app launched by the district administration will get an alert on it, while others will get an  . 

 "The alert mechanisms have got shape. We are in the process of feeding mobile numbers of people living in vulnerable areas in the system. We are also in the process of developing an outbound voice call in Tamil to alert those who cannot read SMS," said district collector Sandeep Nanduri. He told TOI that this alert mechanism will be fully ready to alert nearly 2.5 lakh people in these areas before the onset of the southwest Monsoon in July.
 
 Traditionally, alerts on disaster such as flooding was passed on by the meteorology department or agencies concerned with the district collector and district disaster management agency. From here the message is then passed to the local revenue authorities and announced to people in the low lying areas through tom-tom criers or speakers tied to vehicles. As this was time consuming, it did not reach every nook and corner.
 
 Last year the district administration initiated 'First Responder' in which 10 youths were identified in each of the 125 vulnerable areas. These 1,250 persons will get a call from the district disaster management control room and they in turn will alert people about the possibility of flooding or other natural disasters.
