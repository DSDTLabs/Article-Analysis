 (RAICHUR): Mirchi bajji and soosla made a spicy combination for the posse of   leaders, who stopped by a roadside tea stall in Kalmala village in Raichur district on Monday. AICC president   savoured the soosla, a local delicacy made of puffed rice.

 After addressing a public rally in the village as part of his Janashirvaad Yatra, Rahul, CM Siddaramaiah, party leaders Mallikarjun M Kharge, G Parameshwara, K C Venugopal and   stopped for the snacks, served on a piece of newspaper. Rahul was all smiles as he handed over crisp hot bajjis to all the leaders, calling out to Mallikarjun M Kharge, who was standing a distance away.
 
 The break at the tea stall also lent some hilarious moments. Taking a jibe at PM Narendra Modi’s statement that those selling pakodas are also employed, one of the leaders said: “Give us pakodas”, and was corrected that these were bajjis.
 
 When Rahul was served tea in a steel tumbler, he passed it on to others, preferring to have it in a paper cup. CM Siddaramaiah called tea stall owner Paramma and asked what her daily turnover was. To her reply of around Rs 2,000, he said: “Yeh do note do hazaar ke hain. Mera naam kya hai?’’ As Paramma accepted the money, Shivakumar took a Rs 2,000 note from his wallet and slipped it into Rahul’s pocket. Rahul offered the money to Paramma, but she returned it, saying he was a guest and she couldn’t take money from him.
