BATHINDA: Activists of   BKU ( ) held a dharna outside the Bathinda deputy commissioner’s office on Tuesday to protest against the distress   at Rs 200 per quintal. They said the tuber was being sold at a loss despite the government assurance of buying it at Rs 500 per quintal from fields.

 Demanding that the purchase of potatoes be started at the earliest, they handed over a memorandum to the officials.
 
 “Last week, the state government had announced to purchase potatoes from the fields at Rs 500 per quintal. No purchase has started yet and the potato growers are forced to either sell their produce at rock-bottom prices or keep it in cold stores. We want the purchase of potatoes to be started at the earliest to save farmers from suffering losses,” said BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) Bathinda unit chief  .
 
 The crop has been sown over 6,500 hectares in Bathinda. 
 
 In another protest staged in Mansa, farmers said water was not reaching the villages at the tail-end of canals in Boha area. They demanded that steps be taken by the authorities concerned at the earliest in this regard.
