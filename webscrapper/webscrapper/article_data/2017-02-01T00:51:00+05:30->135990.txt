Pune: Motorcycle maker   on Tuesday posted a 4.73% drop in its third quarter   as combined sales of its two-wheelers and commercial vehicles fell by about a lakh in the three-month period ended December 31, 2016. 

 The city-based automaker posted a   net profit of Rs 925 crore against Rs 971 crore in the same period the previous year.
 
 The firm said it sold 8,51,645 vehicles in the three months between October and December of 2016 compared to 9,51,498 vehicles in the same period a year ago. In the domestic market, the company’s sales of motorcycles and commercial vehicles fell by 5.18% and its exports fell more sharply by 17.49%.
 
 While expecting good growth in the motorcycle segment owing to good monsoon and 7th Pay commission, the firm said due to the demonetisation the domestic industry for motorcycles and commercial vehicles recorded a dip of 16% and 32%, respectively. “The fall in sales of entry level motorcycles was more severe than in premium motorcycles segment in the quarter,” Kevin D’Sa, president (finance) & CFO, Bajaj Auto, said.
