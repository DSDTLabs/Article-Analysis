BHOPAL: It already looks like an ominous year for tigers in  . A fullgrown tigress was found dead under mysterious circumstances in   area of   (STR) on Thursday night, taking this month’s till to three.

 Thirty-one tigers — about 10% of the tiger population in MP — have died in the last 13 months. The tigress found dead on Thursday was translocated from   in March 2015. Officials said it was radio-collared but they were not getting signals for the last one and a half months. “We were trying to locate it to change the radio collar. It was last clicked in camera traps on January 13. We are yet to identify cause of death,” STR field director   told TOI. The collar of another tiger was replaced recently, he added.
 
 Officials have ruled out any poaching attempt. “All its body parts are intact. It doesn’t appear to be a poaching case. Electrocution is also not possible as there is no live wire in the region,” said the officer.
 
 
 
 
 Investigators have also found remains of a spotted deer around 1km from the spot where tigress was found dead.
 
 Samples have been collected to see if it was poisoned. People in Malini village, which is close to Churna range, are being questioned, said officials.
 
 On January 13, a tigress was killed by poachers in the Barghat jungles of   district, and another died in apparent territorial fight.
 
 The state is losing more tigers to witchcraft these days than smuggling for Chinese medicines.
 
 “In almost all the recent incidents, we found that sorcerers coaxed villagers to kill tigers, promising that they could make money ‘rain from the sky’.
 
 More than 50 people have been arrested in recent years,” said an officer.
