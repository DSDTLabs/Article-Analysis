 On Thursday, around 8 am, Deepa left her house for college and was walking towards the bus stop. “He was apparently following her from the moment she stepped out of her house.

 Police said Selvaraj admitted to have stabbed Deepa. He told police that he had been asking Deepa to marry him and when she refused he stabbed her in a fit of rage. “He had planned it well in advance to attack her,” police said.
