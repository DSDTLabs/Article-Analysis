DAVANAGERE: It was a day of embarrassment for  , with its national president   and Dharwad MP Prahlad Joshi making inadvertent gaffes in public, handing   setting off a gleeful deluge on Twitter. 

  Interacting with the media during a tour of Lingayat and Dalit mutts in central  , Shah began making allegations against the   government. "Recently, a retired Supreme Court judge said if ever there was a competition for the most corrupt government, then the   government will get number one..." he said, shocking Yeddyurappa who was seated near him. 
 
  Party MP Pralhad Joshi immediately leaned over to whisper into Shah's ear: "Siddaramaiah government." A stunned Yeddyurappa also reminded Shah that he should have said "Siddaramaiah government was number one in corruption". 
 
 Realising his gaffe, Shah corrected himself in seconds, " Arre re...Siddaramaiah government is number one in corruption." 
 
 After Shah, it was the turn of Joshi who ended up wrongly translating Shah's speech from Hindi into Kannada. After Shah launched a attack against CM Siddaramaiah for not doing anything for the SC and ST communities in the state, Joshi translated it as: "PM Modi did not do anything for the SC/STs." 
 
 Congress was quick to leap on to Shah's faux pas, with Rahul Gandhi tweetting: "Now that the BJP IT cell has announced Karnataka polls, time for a sneak preview of our top secret campaign video! Gifted to us by the BJP President, our campaign in Karnataka is off to a fabulous start. He says Yeddyurappa ran the most corrupt Govt ever... True".
