BENGALURU: A day after 30-year-old homemaker Neha Varma and her 4-year-old son Param were found charred to death in their car parked at the basement of their apartment in  , Forensic Science Laboratory experts visited the spot on Saturday.

 Preliminary investigation indicate that both may have died of suffocation inside the  , FSL sources said. Security guard   had told police the car entered the gate at 3.25pm and went towards the parking bay in the basement. He heard a loud noise and saw the car in flames.
 
 "There was thick smoke from the car a couple of seconds before the flames. The smoke, mostly mixed with carbon dioxide, may have instantly killed the mother and son," FSL sources said, adding, "The fire was so quick that it melted the electrical circuits, jamming the doors. We suspect they tried to open the doors but in vain."
 
 Investigation revealed that they had returned home after lunch at a restaurant around 1.5km from the apartment. "One of Neha's relative who lives nearby said she had called her around 12.20pm to say she was taking her son for lunch," police said.
 
 The bodies were handed over to the family after postmortem at Vydehi Hospital in Whitefield.
 
 On Saturday, police took statements from Neha's husband   Ghatanatti and uncle Madhur Varma. "The couple seemed to be quite happy. Their only child Param would come down to the parking bay in the evening to play with other kids," Saroja K, a neighbour said.
 
 Madhur Varma, who came from Pune on Saturday morning, told police the couple had no differences. "It was a happy family. Neha and Rajesh fell in love while doing their Masters degree in Mysuru. They married around six years ago," he told police.
 
 After spending a year in Mysuru, Rajesh and Neha shifted to Bengaluru and settled in Whitefield, police said. Rajesh, who belongs to Belagavi, runs Road Trip Platform Highway Delite, a startup at Diamond District, Old Airport Road.
