NEW DELHI: Jordan's  , who arrived in India on Tuesday, will meet Prime Minister   at Hyderabad House today.

 
 The key areas of discussion between the two leaders will include defence, security and investments.
 
 King Abdullah, who is known to be against Islamic extremism, could be of great help to India in counter-terror operations.
 
 The visit could also expedite the negotiation of a defence framework agreement between India and Jordan.
 
 In fact, with Abdullah's support, India can deepen security ties with Jordan to leverage its unique strategic location in the Levant, with access to the Red Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.
 
 PM Modi and the king are also likely to explore ways to deepen bilateral trade ties, which are especially significant as twenty textile industries from India have invested around $300 million in Jordan.
 
 Both sides are also expected to expand cooperation in several key sectors including healthcare, IT and customs.
 
 Yesterday, King Abdullah visited the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi to explore collaboration with Jordanian technical institutes.
 
 The king's visit comes soon after Modi's visit to Jordan earlier this month - the first by an Indian PM in 30 years.
