BENGALURU: Two months after second-year PU examination results were announced, the department of pre-university education (DPUE) is yet to hand over original markscards to students.

 On Thursday, several students thronged the PU board office in the city, seeking the original markscards as they had to submit them to the institutions where they had secured admission. But the PU department contested this claim, saying the procedure followed year after year is to hand over provisional marksheets to students -which are equivalent to the original -to avoid delay in admissions.
 
 M Srikant  , father of CET topper Pratheek, who has bagged a seat at IIT-Guwahati, was at the office to check the status of his son's markscard. "Next week, I ha ve to go to Guwahati for his admission, but we have not received the original marksheet yet. The authorities at   specifically mentioned that they need the original markscard and not a provisional one," he said.
 
 "After a long wait, the PU department gave me a letter saying they certify my son as a student who has passed the examination under the board and his provisional marksheet can be considered official," Nayak added.
 
 Many like Nayak waited for hours to get the original markscard. Another parent, Kavita Ranjan, said, "My daughter has secured a seat in a US university. And they insist on submitting the original markscard first. But the PU board says it will take one more month for it to be delivered.We are scheduled to leave on August 3 and the board is not even ready to post the markscard. Other boards have already released marksheets."
