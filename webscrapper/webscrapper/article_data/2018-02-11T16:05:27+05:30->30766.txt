 has slammed her   co-star  , calling her a 'hypocrite' after she expressed her condolences following the death of the  's brother. 

 Earlier this week, Kim's brother,  , was found dead, a day after the actor believed he went missing. 
 
  
  
 Kim vented her ire towards Sarah on   where she shared a text photo, that read "I don't need your love or support at this tragic time Sarah Jessica Parker". 
 
 "My Mom asked me today 'When will that Sarah Jessica Parker, that hypocrite, leave you alone?' Your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now," Kim posted along side the photo. 
 
 "Let me make this very clear. (If I haven't already) You are not my family. You are not my friend. So I'm writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your 'nice girl' persona," she added. 
 
  
  
 Kim also included a link to an article that claimed there had been tension between her and Sarah during the filming of the 'Sex and the City' movies. 
 
 Sarah has not yet responded to Kim's comments. 
 
 Last October, the actor had reportedly said that things would have been better on the sets of the film based on the hit HBO series, if Sarah had been 'nicer'. 
 
 After Sarah said she was 'disappointed' the third movie never materialised, many speculated the project had fallen apart because of Kim, who reportedly made "outrageous demands" to appear. 
 
 "The only 'DEMAND' I ever made was that I didn't want to do a third film... And that was back in 2016," Kim had tweeted in response to the reports.
