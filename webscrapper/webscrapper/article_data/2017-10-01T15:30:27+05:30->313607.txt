For the past few months,  's Ravan-makers have been busy crafting the ten-headed demon effigies. Today as we celebrate   with much pomp and fare, we speak to some of the effigy-makers in the city who have toiled away day and night to make   effigies.

 Gautam, an artisan who works in  , tells us that his family has been in the business of making effigies in Bareilly for the last three generations. He says, "It takes nearly a month to prepare the effigies of Ravan, Meghnad and Kumbhakaran for Dussehra. Our effigies have been in demand not only in Bareilly, but also in adjoining places like Budaun, Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur. This year, we have made huge effigies on bamboo frames with lots of newspapers and glazed paper. The moustache has been given an upward twirl. We have used sparkles, glitter paints to decorate face, body and head structures to add a festive look." Sonu, another artisan from Subhash Nagar, tells us, "I have been into effigy-making for the past ten years. I learnt this art from my father. This work gives me immense pleasure. The best part about my profession is the appreciation that one gets for this work. Everybody notices Ravan and a month before Dussehra is the peak business season for us." He adds, "This year, I've used glitter sheets and colourful cut-outs to decorate the effigies instead of plain sheets."
 Sonu adds, "Pichle kuch dino se tez baarish ki wajah se inn effigies ko store karna mushkil ho gaya tha as we did not have proper space."
