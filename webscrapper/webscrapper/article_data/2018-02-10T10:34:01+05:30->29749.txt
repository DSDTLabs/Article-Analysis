BATHINDA: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday alleged that 'goonda tax' being imposed on businesses in the region by henchmen of the Congress leaders was affecting the industry and trade and had even endangered the very existence of the Bathinda refinery. 

 Addressing a rally at   village in   assembly segment of Bathinda, Sukhbir said the Congress MLAs of the district were not only collecting 'goonda tax' but were also smuggling liquor from Haryana for sale.
