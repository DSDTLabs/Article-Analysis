CHIPLUN: Darshan Tukrul, the 10-year-old who died in Friday’s mishap, was a student of Raje Shivaji Vidyalay in Dadar. He was travelling in the ill-fated luxury bus along with 12 family members and relatives to attend a wedding at Kharepatan in Sindhudurg district.

 “Darshan was a quiet and intelligent boy. His elder sister Puja (13), mother Sakshi (45), and aunt Sheetal Masurkar (48) are also injured and admitted to the local hospital,” said the boy’s father, Shashikant Tukrul, who lives near Sandhurst Road.
 
 Shashikant was being helped by other relatives to complete various hospital formalities on Friday. A close relative, Pradip Masurkar, who works as a pharmacist in Mumbai, said, “Darshan’s sister, Puja, has suffered a spine injury, so her condition is bad. Since this is a private hospital, the medical bills have come up to Rs 70,000. We are trying to shift the other patients to Mumbai’s JJ Hospital.”
 
 Masurkar said that Darshan was a cheerful youngster who excelled in academics and sports. “This is a very big tragedy for our entire family, only because of the foolishness and reckless driving of one man. We don’t know how to deal with this,” he added.
 
 Ashok Gurav, assistant inspector of Dahisar police station, said, “I was also in the bus with my colleague and friend, Dilip Parab, who is injured. Many passengers were complaining about the manner in which the driver was speeding.” Mahesh Shinde, a relative of an injured passenger, said, “At one point, the luggage on top of the rack fell down due to speeding and reckless driving. Yet the driver did not slow down.” Experts say the Mumbai-Goa highway is accident-prone and most mishaps take place due to overtaking or lane-cutting. Locals have held demonstrations to urge the authorities to widen the motorway.
