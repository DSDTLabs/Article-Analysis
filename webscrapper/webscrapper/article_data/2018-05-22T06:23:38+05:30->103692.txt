MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Monday directed a medical board of   to examine two women who have moved the court to terminate their pregnancies. One has a daughter who is mentally challenged and does not want the same fate for her second child.

 
 A vacation bench of Justices   and   heard a petition by the women, through their advocate,  , as they are barred by law from the medical termination of pregnancy beyond 20 weeks. They are residents of Thane and   and in their 25th week.
 
 In the 37-year-old Thane resident’s case, during routine screening for structural defects, the foetus was detected with intracranial abnormalities. An MRI confirmed the diagnosis of a porencephalic cyst. The doctor felt the baby will have neurological problems like cerebral palsy, hearing and visual defects.
 
 “It was also noted that the petitioner’s two-year-old daughter has similar brain anomalies and that she has global development delay, she cannot see well and has uncontrollable epilepsy,’’ her petition said. On learning of the foetal abnormality and prognosis, she moved HC. Her petition said that “continuation of the pregnancy had led the petitioner to undergo severe psychological, physical and emotional trauma”.
 
 The 25-year-old Bandra resident’s foetus was detected with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The doctor felt foetal MRI indicated “poor prognosis of survival and there is a chance the baby may not survive after birth in spite of best efforts”.
 
 The judges directed constitution of a medical board headed by the dean and with heads of gynaecology, radiology and psychiatry, a pediatric/cardiac surgeon and any other expert if required. The board will examine both women on Tuesday and submit its reports on Wednesday “setting out whether in their view it will be advisable to terminate the pregnancy.”
 
 The HC had in April permitted a minor victim of rape to terminate her 24-week pregnancy.
