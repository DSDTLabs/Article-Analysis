BENGALURU: A 34-year-old scooterist, who was hit by a truck on Tuesday morning, lay at   on   with one leg crushed and another fractured for 20 minutes. Passersby were busy clicking videos on their mobile phones instead of helping him take to hospital.

 Finally, Somasundar, a police constable attached with Byatarayanapura traffic police, who was deployed near the junction, rushed to the injured man’s rescue, flagged down a car and took him to Fortis Hospital in Nagarabhavi. Doctors had to amputate the left leg of Madan Lal, a resident of   near  , and employee of a hardware shop. He may lose his other leg too, doctors said. Madan Lal was on his way to work on his scooter when a truck hit him at 9.30am.
 
  Madan Lal fell and both his legs came under the truck’s wheels. But the truck driver sped away. 
 
 “None came forward to help him. They were busy videographing the incident as he was writhing in pain,” a police officer said.
 
 A case has been registered against the truck driver, who is absconding. “Doctors said he may lose his right leg too as its main nerves have been damaged. We have requested them to wait for 24 hours to see if his condition improves,” said Uday Ram, Madan Lal’s relative.
