MUMBAI: A group of students from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences ( ) held a condolence meeting on Tuesday for   scholar Muthu Krishnan, who committed suicide in Delhi. The students are planning to write to the President seeking an independent inquiry into the death of the M Phil student, terming it another case of an ‘institutional murder’. Muthu Krishnan was an alumnus of the Hyderabad Central University, where late Rohith Vemula was a student.

 “We want to tell the authorities that Rohith’s case was not isolated. These are clear cases of ‘institutional murders’. Some of the students who know Muthu Krishnan told us that he has been trying to get into JNU for last five years. Finally he got a seat in the institute in the sixth year and he committed suicide. But the authorities’ claim that he was frustrated due to personal issues,” said a TISS student. The informal gathering was organized by the Ambedkarite Students’ Association at the institute. The students are planning to get in touch with their friends from JNU to find out more about the student. 
 
 Around 60 students attended the gathering.
