KOLKATA: A BA first-year student of Loreto College was found hanging in the bathroom of a YWCA hostel on   late on Monday. Police sources think 19-year-old Riya  , who hailed from  , killed herself because she was disappointed with her exam marks. 

 Around 8pm on Monday, some of her hostelmates who went looking for her in her room - 21 C - on the second floor found the bathroom locked from the inside. After several knocks on the door evoked no response, they alerted hostel authorities and the nearby   police station. The cops broke open the door and found the girl hanging from a dupatta.
 
 "Her friends said she was worried about studies. She had gone to the college and taken her economics examination on Monday," said an officer. She also received her Hindi marks on Monday, where she reportedly scored 19 out of 50. She was visibly upset with her score, said sources. Though cops haven't found any suicide note, they believe this might have caused her to take her own life. "There is no indication of foul play. The body has been sent for autopsy and her parents have been informed," said a source. 
 
 About a month ago, another 19-year-old - Parna Dutta, a student at  , had taken her own life after failing her college examination.
