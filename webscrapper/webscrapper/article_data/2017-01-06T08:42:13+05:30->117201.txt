VARANASI: While Varanasi managed to improve its ranking with   downloads crossing over 13,500 mark, the other two cities from UP, Aligarh and Ghaziabad, which featured among the top 100, witnessed a slump in positions after the   ended on Tuesday midnight. 

 The download count that was 8,500 till Monday midnight reached 13,587 within 24 hours, courtesy the   by the Varanasi Municipal Corporation (VMC) as part of its initiative to propagate the app among general public. 
 
 It was a result of the last few days’ war-footing efforts by the civic body officials who held camps, visited public areas including ghats, city markets especially mobile outlets and got maximum people to download the MoUD’s Swachhata App on their android as well as OS-operating smartphones. The city’s ranking, that slipped down from 14th to 16th position on Tuesday morning, shot up to 12th position before the deadline ended at midnight. 
 
 It is to be mentioned here that Varanasi is the only city from UP that is in top 20 where as Aligarh and Ghaziabad slipped from 60th to 64th and 81st to 85th spot, respectively. However, the two cities succeeded in figuring among the top 100 cities. 
 
 Though the civic body was targeting to garner a minimum of 14,500 downloads against the targeted 25,000 to secure some marks of the allocated 300 marks (of a total 2,000 marks on survey), it was still short of a 1,000 downloads when the deadline ended. “Had we managed to cross 14,500 downloads, we would have succeeded in scoring 20 marks at least. But, still we gave a tough fight and did not give up till the end,” said municipal commissioner  .
 
 He further said, “The game has just begun and now we are focusing on resolution of the complaints by the denizens who downloaded the app and showed their faith in us. We are sure that its outcome would reflect in the citizen feedback pointer on the survey.” He further added that they will claim for 55 marks for the previous efforts for getting 3,000 downloads on Swachh Kashi App, launched on August 15 last year under the aegis of MoUD.
