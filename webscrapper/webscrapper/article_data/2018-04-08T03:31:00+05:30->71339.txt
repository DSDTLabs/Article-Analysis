Panaji: After the state cabinet approved the Goa State Incentives To Encourage Investments Scheme, 2017, for industries, the industries department has notified the amended scheme also called the Umbrella Scheme.  Once implemented, it will provide financial assistance to industries that set up in the state. The amended Goa State Incentives to Encourage Investments Scheme, 2017, will replace the Umbrella Scheme notified on October 12, 2017. As per the notification, the state will subsidise the salary paid to Goan employees, offering to reimburse up to Rs 7,000 per Goan employed by companies that set up or expand operations in Goa. Only new companies, or those that began after the year 2007 but did not avail of benefits, can apply for it, provided 80% of their staff is Goan. As such, the department of industries, trade and commerce will have to release payment to the beneficiary within 15 days of receiving the sanction order. The scheme comprises seven target schemes for industries and lists out the timeline for industries to apply for incentives and for disbursement of funds.  Incentives of up to Rs 10 lakh can be sanctioned by the director of Industries, trade and commerce, while for amounts between Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh, the approval of the secretary for industries will have to be sought.
