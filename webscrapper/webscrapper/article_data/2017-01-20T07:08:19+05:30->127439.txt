AMRITSAR: While BJP is trying to woo voters for the   and   together, its alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal is seeking support for its own symbol `takri' (weighing scales) without mentioning `kamal' (lotus)--symbol of the saffron party. Voting for both the polls is on the same day --February 4.

 `Hath khade kar ke kaho tusi vote takri nu paogay (raise your hands and say you will vote for takri),“ is how Akali leaders in Amritsar district talk at their rallies, with no mention of the Lok Sabha bypoll where   is contesting. The situation is same in all nine assembly constituencies falling under the  .
 
 “How can I talk about pressing button of `takri' and `kamal' both on the electronic voting machines (EVMs) from the same stage and to the same audience? They will be utterly confused. First, I need to talk about myself,“ said an Akali candidate who didn't wish to be named.
 
 During a rally of Chhina, al so attended by Akalis, BJP leaders and workers are seen persuading the prospective voters to press button of lotus on EVMs. “I don't think there is any confusion. We ask voters to press `kamal' for `upparlay' (higher) and `takri' for `nichlay' (lower) elections. Voters are very intelligent and they understand everything,“ said Chhina.
 
 However, SAD sources said that the situation was especially difficult in rural constituencies having low percentage of literate voters. “We even try to avoid accompanying Lok Sabha candidate to his election campaign to the same voters. They recognize us well and many have shown their confusion saying `last time you asked to vote for the scales and now you are saying to vote for lotus,“ said another Akali leader.
