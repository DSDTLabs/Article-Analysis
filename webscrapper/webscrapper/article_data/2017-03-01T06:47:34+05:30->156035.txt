Gurgaon: Two men were arrested in Dwarka, Delhi, on Tuesday for their alleged role in the last week’s double murder in Farrukhanagar.

 Ved Saini (48) and   (52) are accused of shooting two property dealers   and Ramavtar and injuring Sunil, after allegedly duping them in a property deal. Several other suspects — including a retired armyman named Rajesh who reportedly owns the SUV used by the accused to escape after the murders — are still at large.
 
 Police said Saini and Jagbir were trying to escape from the city when they were arrested. “The duo have confessed to their crime. Another accused will be arrested soon,” said Gurgaon DCP (crime) Sumit Kuhar. 
 
 Saini and Jagbir have told police that they did not shoot the victims, blaming three fellow suspects instead. Police said they are verifying the claim.
 
 In his statement, Sunil, who remains hospitalised, said they had purchased a plot in Farrukhnagar through Saini. But later it was found that the plot had already been sold to someone else, resulting in a bitter dispute.
