BENGALURU: There seems to be no end to  's rocky relationship with  's diehard West Block fans. At the   stadium on Sunday, the   coach trudged off amidst a torrent of abuses from the frenzied supporters, who were celebrating the Blues' hardfought 1-0 win over the I-League title contenders.

 Two seasons ago, Jamil, then   coach, had collapsed in his dugout claiming that he had been hit by a bottle thrown from the stands. He then sported a bandaged forehead. On Sunday, the Blues were not ready to forgive his 'theatrics'. Leading Bengaluru's charge was skipper  , who got into a heated argument with Jamil during the first half. Minutes later, Chhetri came and stood in front of the Aizawl dugout and demanded his medical staff to attend to him. He then resumed the match, cheekily sporting a huge bandage covering the small cut on his forehead and Jamil probably would have got the message.
 
 After a bruising battle, Chhetri - who floated in the free-kick that saw Serbian Marjan Jugovic head in the winner in the 94th minute - ran towards the Aizawl dugout and celebrated with his arms outstretched in front of Jamil. The fans too joined in as the stands resonated with non-stop abuses till Jamil finally walked off the pitch, the injury-time goal having dented their race for the title.
 
 Aizawl are on top of the league with 30 points from 15 matches and Bengaluru are fifth with 21 points from the same number of games.
