GURUGRAM: The MCG started the   in its areas and   on Tuesday, and claimed that it would complete the work by June-end. In all, 31 areas have been identified and the maximum number of roads that need to be repaired are in zone-2. While in zone 1, 11 major roads will be repaired, 12 will be repaired in zone 2 and four roads each will be repaired in in zone 3 and 4. 

 The authorities have uploaded the entire schedule on its website with the cost of each road that is going to be repaired. “The primary reason for uploading the details on the website is because we want the residents to know when roads in their areas will be repaired. Also, local politicians put pressure on us to give preference to the roads in their locality on priority and repair them. However, now that the work schedule is in public domain, they cannot pressure us,” a senior   said.
 
 CM Manohar Lal Khattar had inaugurated the   during his visit to the city on Tuesday. The entire project will cost MCG Rs 102.499 crore. 
 
 “The scope of work includes two types of roads — bituminous and concrete roads. Although the work is to be completed in a year as per the contract, keeping in mind monsoon, we have asked the contractor to complete the work by June 30. Work will be carried out at multiple locations simultaneously,” the official said.
