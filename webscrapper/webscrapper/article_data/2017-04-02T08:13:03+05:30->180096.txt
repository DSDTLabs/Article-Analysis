MADURAI: The   in   has achieved 100%   for a record fifth consecutive year. 

 Municipal commissioner Mohammed Mohideen had directed his staff to meet the tax collection targets by the deadline of March 31 and the 10 bill collectors and two revenue inspectors complied with it. From the month of October, these officers launched their tax collection drive. 
 
 They went on door-to-door campaigns and also distributed pamphlets on tax dues. People too played their part by paying taxes on time. 
 
 One reason behind this achievement, said revenue inspector Venkat Mani, is that since its inception, the municipality has had the prestige of being headed by an officer of the ICS ( ) cadre, and now an IAS. In 2012, the municipality celebrated 50 years of 100% tax collection in a grand manner. A total property tax of 194 lakh was collected from 28,600 buildings in the municipality. TNN
