 One of the best things about 'Poorna'’s album is the fact that it does not have a single remix. The film, based on the real-life story of the 13-year-old girl who climbed  , is definitely an inspirational one. The first track, ' ', conveys that emotion in a warm, albeit subtle way. Arijit Singh’s melodious vocals along with the combo of Amitabh Bhattacharya’s lyrics and Salim-Sulaiman’s music, makes this lilting pop song easily one of the best picks. The lyrics resonate with the story and the contemporary background chorus of chants is noteworthy.
 
 The ‘Intimate version’ of 'Kuch Parbat Hilaayein' is an acoustic cover that gives a new take to the melody we are already familiar with. Salim’s poignant performance gets a breezy vibe, thanks to the soft guitars strings in the background. The melody in 'Poori Qaaynaat' — a semi-classical track that has a solid pop, soft-rock base — is rendered by  . Right from the aalap to the antaras, he showcases his skill in the vocal department. Vishal Dadlani’s powerful support vocals add to the number.
 
 ' ' is sombre and almost melancholic. Arijit scores with his unmistakable classical nuances in this track that leaves you slow clapping at his range as a trained vocalist.
