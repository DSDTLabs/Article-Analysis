PANAJI: The Corporation of the City of Panaji’s use of innovative methods to address cleanliness and solid waste management has helped the state capital bag the ‘Best State Capital Award for Innovation & Best Practices’ in the   Surveksan-2018.

 
  
 
 “The Union ministry is happy with   city especially with the innovation of using fewer resources to manage higher quantum of garbage,” said chief executive of Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Pvt Ltd Swayandipta Pal Chaudhuri.
 
 The innovation in the capital is an efficient door-to-door garbage collection system, said Chaudhuri. “Panaji has been able to handle solid waste without a landfill site,” he said.
 
 The city-wise ranking was not released by late Wednesday evening but the Union ministry for housing & urban affairs said Indore had once again emerged as the cleanest city in the country. Incidentally, Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Pvt Ltd and CCP tried to take cues from Indore on how to make Panaji cleaner.
 
 As part of Swachh Survekshan-2018, 223 locals were interviewed by an independent agency in Panaji, while 289 inputs were given through the   for Panaji itself.
 
 “We have got time till October 2018 to make Goa open defecation free but it could be one of the areas where Goa missed out on getting a better rank. Somehow, Goa has not been able to meet the parameters set under the mission programme,” said minister for urban development Francis D’Souza.
