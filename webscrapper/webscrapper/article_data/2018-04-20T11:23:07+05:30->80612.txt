HYDERABAD: Character artiste   Thursday lodged a complaint at the Raidurgam police station against actress  , who has been vocal about the casting couch in Tollywood.   the complaint for alleged objectionable comments made against actor-turned-politician  , who is the chief of Jana Sena Party.

 In his complaint, Siva Balaji said Sri Reddy had ‘abused’ his role model Pawan Kalyan using filthy language. “I was shocked and asked for details about the incident and found that Sri Reddy was politically motivated by some groups and passed comments abusing Jana Sena Party and its chief Pawan Kalyan, thereby provoking his fans and party workers breaking public peace.’’ Being an associate of Pawan Kalyan, Siva Balaji claimed his sentiments were hurt due to Sri Reddy’s comments.
 
 Raidurgam inspector M Ram Babu said since this was a non-cognizable offence, court permission was sought and, once they get the nod, they would register a case.
 
 “Even if a case is registered at the Raidurgam police station, it will be transferred to   police station as a case on the same issue was already registered there,” police said.
