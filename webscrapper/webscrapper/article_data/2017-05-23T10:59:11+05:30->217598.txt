COIMBATORE:  , near  , has plenty of government  . What it lacks is a  . Though 20 lakh was allotted through the MLA fund almost six months ago, it has not materialised due to opposition from caste Hindus, say villagers. 

  Kaliappagoundanpudur has a population of around 1,500, half of them dalits and scheduled tribes forced to host functions in homes or on the road. The village has three temples, run by a committee.
 
 At the collectorate on Monday,  , a petitioner, said, "They sanctioned 20 lakh for the hall and promised more funds once the construction began." "A poromboke plot was identified." 
 
 But some temple committee members opposed the project. "The Nallayan temple shares a compound wall with the proposed community hall. Younger committee members feel that once the community hall comes up many lower caste people will start hosting functions there and this will make the premises impure," said committee president K V Varadharaj, who is supporting the project.
