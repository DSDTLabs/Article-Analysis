NEW DELHI: The high court has decided to examine the steps required to ensure quality education in schools controlled or owned by government and  .

 A bench of Chief Justice   and Justice   said the present provision under Right to Education Act to monitor quality of schools appears insufficient, while hearing a petition that schools owned or controlled by government or local authorities should obtain a recognition certificate similar to private schools.
 
 “Though certain details have been furnished in the additional counter affidavit (filed by the Centre) it appears to us that the existing regulatory mecha nism is not sufficient to ensure quality education in schools owned or controlled by the government or local authorities,“ the bench said, adding that “we are also of the view that in the absence of a suitable amendment to section 18 (1) of RTE Act, the object of the RTE Act, more particularly Article 21-A of the Constitution of India, may not be achieved in letter and spirit.“
 
 In its May 17 order last year, HC had directed the government to file an affidavit furnishing details of the mechanism in place for regulating standards in government schools.
 
 HC observed that the Centre is silent on certain issues and the matter requires further consideration, posting the matter for further hearing in March.
 
 The order came on a PIL filed by an NGO, Independent Thought, which alleged that exclusion of the government-run schools under Section 18(1) of RTE Act from obtaining a recognition certificate violated the Constitution.
