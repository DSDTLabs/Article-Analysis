For years,   has been complaining of a dearth of local Telugu-speaking actresses. The inflow of heroines from other states in the industry is so huge that it is tough to find local girls. Though, a slew of Telugu girls with the likes of Ritu Varma, Eesha Rebba, Anisha Ambrose, Shivani Rajasekhar and Priyanka Jawalkar are foraying into Tollywood, but is that enough?

 Aspiring Telugu actor   has been making headlines for the past couple of weeks for making controversial statements on Tollywood biggies in connection with casting couch, had alleged that the producers and directors were importing heroines from other states, denying roles to the non-native female actors despite their talent. 
 
 When Kannada actress  , who is one movie old in Tollywood and is gearing up for the release of her next Telugu project ‘Krishnarjuna Yuddham’ was asked about the same, she said that she was never asked where she was from when she was offered the roles. She also said that she believes that Tollywood ‘is too loving to not give opportunities to local talent’, because at the end, ‘it is talent that they choose’. When asked whether she had a brush with casting couch, the actor said that she had heard about such incidents, but they are more of rumours than first-person experience.
