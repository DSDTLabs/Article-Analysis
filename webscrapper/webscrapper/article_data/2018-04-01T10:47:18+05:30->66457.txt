 -   starrer 'Aravindante Athidhikal's' teaser has just been released and the video showcases an interesting moment with the dad - son actors Vineeth and Sreenivasan.
  In conversation about an old lodge, they discuss how it can be renovated and the various facilities that can be incorporated, so that they can charge more rent for its rooms. The chat ends when Vineeth uses the age-old   dialogue from 'Akkare Akkare Akkare,' 'Enthu Manoharamaayam Nadakkaatha Swapnam' (How beautifully unrealistic dream). Vineeth plays the eponymous character of the film, which has music by Shaan Rahman.

 Aravindan is a lodge manager in the movie and it's a feel good entertainer. It discusses what transpires between a few of his guests and him, at one point of time. The director had earlier told us that the story mostly unfolds in Karnataka. Nikhila plays a character named Varada, who would also be one of the guests at the lodge. Rajesh Raghavan has penned the film's script.
