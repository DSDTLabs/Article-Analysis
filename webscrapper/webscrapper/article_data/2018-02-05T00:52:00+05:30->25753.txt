Tirupur: District collector K S Palanisamy has urged eight government departments - revenue, police, rural development, fire and rescue services, public works department, public medicine and animal husbandry - to work together to ensure proper conduct of the district’s first jallikattu at Alagumalai on February 18. “For most officials the event will be new unless they had worked in southern districts where the bull taming sport is traditional. We could take cue from our counterparts there,” said a senior police officer, adding that the organisers were yet to finalise the plans for the event.  At a coordination meeting held at the collectorate on Friday, Palanisamy had warned the organisers to cancel the event if they failed to complete the works 24 hours prior to the event.  The collector directed the organisers and the officials to stick to the guidelines issued for conducting the sport. “The organisers should ensure that all the bulls and tamers are registered in advance, and no bull owners should be allowed to give any enhancement drugs or irritants to the bulls,” he said .  On Sunday, state animal husbandry minister Udumalai K Radhakrishnan inaugurated the works for erecting ‘Vadivasal’ for the event.
