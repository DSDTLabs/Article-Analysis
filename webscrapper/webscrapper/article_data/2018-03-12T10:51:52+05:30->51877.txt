In obese individuals and Type 2 diabetes patients, the excess amount of fat especially abdominal fat (tummy fat) causes resistance to the action of insulin secreted by pancreas and hampers its activity. In return, the body produces more insulin from pancreas to keep the blood sugar under control. This excess amount of insulin secreted by the body promotes skin cell growth which leads to acanthosis nigricans.

At this stage diabetes can be prevented by simple lifestyle modification and moderate weight loss. Keeping in mind that complications caused by diabetes on damaging retina, kidney, nerves, heart, vascular system and financial burden caused by treatment, it is important to STOP DIABETES here.
