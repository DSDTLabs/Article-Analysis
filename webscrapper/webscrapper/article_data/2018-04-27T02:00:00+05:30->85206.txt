PATNA: Former Union minister   on Thursday suggested the Centre to bring petrol and diesel under the ambit of goods and services tax (GST) to provide relief to common people.

 Expressing concern over the recent rise in prices of petroleum products in many parts of the country, Yadav said in a statement that though the international prices of petrol and diesel are less than half as compared to the prices 4 years ago, the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre is not passing on the benefit to the consumers because it is filling up its kitty through excise duty and other taxes which should have been avoided.
 
 “This (Modi) government has intentionally not included petrol and diesel under the ambit of GST due to which prices have not stabilized. Unless petrol and diesel are brought under the ambit of GST, people will continue to bear the brunt of high prices of petroleum products,” Yadav, a known critic of PM Modi, said.
 
 Yadav, who vehemently opposed JD (U) president and CM Nitish Kumar for breaking away from the Grand Alliance and realigning with the BJP to form a new coalition government in the state in July last year, said the prices of petrol and diesel were being hiked daily in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and other parts of the country. “While the diesel price has touched the record high in Delhi, petrol price is at the highest level since September 2013. Hike in petrol and diesel prices leads to increase in prices of essential commodities and affects the common people,” Yadav said.
 
 He said since the ruling party at the Centre was busy in Hindu-Muslim division, no concrete development was taking place in the country. “Almost all citizens are crying, whether they are students, servicemen, businessmen or people from deprived sections of society under the present regime,” he said.
