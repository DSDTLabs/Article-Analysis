NEW DELHI: Mining baron G Janardhana   will not be able to campaign for his brother who is fighting assembly elections in   in his home turf as the   refused his plea for relaxation in bail conditions to allow him to enter   district. 

 
 While granting him bail, the SC had directed Reddy not to visit his home town of Ballari, besides Ananthapur and Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh to ensure free and fair probe against him for alleged involvement in illegal mining. 
 
 As his younger brother and   party candidate G Somashekhar Reddy is contesting assembly election, Reddy approached the apex court seeking its permission to visit Ballari district for a week for campaigning. 
 
 A bench of Justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan, however, dismissed his plea
