NEW DELHI: External affairs minister   Swaraj’s visit to Nepal will be the first opportunity in the new year to reset relations with Kathmandu, which have been strained for some time, and particularly after the recent elections.

 On Thursday and Friday, Swaraj will meet all the top political leaders — Sher Bahadur Deuba, KP Oli and   — as well as calling on president Bidya Bhandari. Her visit comes days before the Left alliance is scheduled to form its government.
 
 Swaraj will be the first senior Indian minister to visit Nepal after the conclusion of elections to local bodies, provincial assemblies and Parliament.
 
 India-Nepal ties have been in poor shape, compounded by a recent controversy of boundary pillars and encroachment on the no-man’s land between the two countries. It was only a few weeks ago that India and Nepal agreed to resolve differences on reconstructing damaged pillars along the mutual border. It was one more of the thorny issues between the two sides.
