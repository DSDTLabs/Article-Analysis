CHENNAI: Chennaiite Vinodh Kumar Ramu has made it to the finals of  ' (PETA) 2017 'Cutest Vegetarian Next Door Contest', beating hundreds of other contestants from across India. He is one of the top 20 finalists.   will ultimately crown two winners -- one man and one woman - next week.

 "This is the fifth year we are conducting the contest. It's a fun way to reach out to people and spread more awareness as to why one should turn vegetarian and why it is a healthier option," says Sachin Bangera, associate director of celebrity and public relations,  .
 
 Entries are invited during August and September every year. "People aged 15 to 29 can then send in their photos as well as stories of why they turned vegetarian," says Bangera.
 
 Ramu, for instance, has been a vegetarian since birth and vegan for four months. "I witnessed the cruelty behind dairy and decided to quit eating it. I strongly believe it's immoral to exploit any species," he says.
 
 Twenty finalists are picked - 10 men and 10 women - based on their stories as well as looks. People can vote for their favourite finalists by logging on to www.petaindia.com. Voting will be open to the public until September 29. 
 
 "The winners get a certificate, sash, PETA T-shirt and a book," says Bangera, adding that winners will be announced on October 3.
