LUCKNOW: Two days ahead of the seventh and last phase of UP assembly elections, BSP chief   attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not constituting Lokpal as it would hit the BJP government first.

 “The reason BJP government speaks of taking action against corrupt politicians and babus but doesn't constitute the Lokpal is that it would hit their own people,“ said Mayawati, speaking to reporters in Lucknow, on Monday. Mayawati also accused the PM of gaining “sadistic pleasure“ out of his demonetisation scheme which affected the poor.
