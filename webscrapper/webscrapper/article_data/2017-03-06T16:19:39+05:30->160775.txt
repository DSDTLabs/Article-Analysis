If you were impressed by   Gupta’s powerful performance in ‘Jolly LLB 2’, she has another surprise in store for you. The 31-year-old actress will reportedly be seen as a 14-year-old girl in Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif-starrer ‘Jagga Jasoos’. Sayani plays the role of Ranbir’s friend in the adventure comedy. 

 Turns out, it was director Anurag Basu who thought she would be a perfect fit for the role of a 14-year-old. Sayani even cut off her mane during the audition itself to look convincing as a teenager. After being zeroed in for the role, Sayani insisted that she sport a short bob for her role – an idea that the film’s lead actor Ranbir agreed upon. Not just that, it was reportedly Ranbir’s hairstylist who chopped off her locks and gave her a short bob for ‘Jagga Jasoos’.
