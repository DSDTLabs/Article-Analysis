 Nora Fatehi, who participated in the ninth season of ' ' and ' ', will make her debut as a host with the show, 'Dating In The Dark'. Based on an international format, the show features men and women, who are introduced to each other with the prospect of finding love, but with a catch — they need to get to know each other in the dark. The reason for doing that is to highlight the ultimate question — do looks really matter?

She’ll be seen playing Bitti’s (Prakruti Mishra) mother on the show. The actress informs, “It’s a cameo and my death will bring about a drastic change in the life of the protagonist.

 Launched in January this year, TV show 'Jai Kanhaiya Lal Ki' ('JKLK'), which features   and Sweta Bhattacharya as the lead couple, will end on May 26. Vishal says, “'JKLK' is a remake of a popular Bengali show and we stuck to the original script initially. The makers soon realised that the Hindi-viewing audience is different from Bengali and made some alterations because of which the ratings saw a rise. However, in a couple of days, we learnt that the show is wrapping up. The reasons for pulling it off air are still unclear, but as actors, we don’t have a say in such matters.”
 The new show titled Musakaan, featuring Sonakshi Save and Arina Dev, will occupy the slot.
