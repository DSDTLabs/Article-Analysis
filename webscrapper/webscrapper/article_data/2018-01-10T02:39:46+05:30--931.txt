GURGAON: The   (MCG) sealed seven illegal   in Rajiv Chowk, Basai and   village on Tuesday.

 According to an MCG official, most meat shops in the city are illegal. 
 
 In March, 2017 the civic agency had shut down many of these   shops after the government had asked all municipal bodies in the state to provide information on the number of authorised slaughterhouses.
 
 “Most of these meat shops in the city do not have the requisite permission to operate as they do not have the mandatory health license. The condition in which these meat shops operate are extremely unhygienic and none of them follow the required guidelines. This is the reason we have decided to take strict action against these shops,” said the MCG official.
 
 MCG’s plan to have a modern abattoir has been hanging since it was first proposed in 2012. It had then proposed to construct a multi-level modern slaughterhouse in Sector 37, similar to the one in   in Delhi. However, it was forced to alter its plan under pressure from local residents, who did not wish to have a slaughterhouse in their backyard. After dropping its plan, the MCG is now planning to construct one slaughterhouse outside the limits of the city and approached the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructural Development Corporation (HSIIDC) for the purpose.
 
 The HSIIDC has agreed to provide two acres of land for the slaughterhouse in IMT Sohna and informed MCG about the same. However, the exact location is yet to be finalised.
