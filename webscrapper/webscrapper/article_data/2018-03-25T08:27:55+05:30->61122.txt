However, it was misunderstood as for all passengers. So we will be issuing a new guideline regarding security arrangements for the devotees going from Gujarat. We are working out a security plan with assistance of government of India to ensure saftey of devotees going for Amarnath."
 
 Earlier, transport commissioner RM Jadhav, had told TOI: “The guideline to have bulletproof jackets was given by the home department. It is for the safety of the passengers. The circular has been issued as several people from Gujarat died in the terrorist attack during Amarnath tour last year.”
