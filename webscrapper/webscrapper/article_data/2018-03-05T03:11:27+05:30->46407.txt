MUMBAI: Is rising heat taking a toll on wildlife? A severely dehydrated male   was found partly unconscious on the slope of a hillock between Malad and   on Sunday morning.

 Its left side was badly bruised, possibly after it fell off the hillock, said Ankit Vyas, a volunteer with Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, who was part of the rescue operation. The adult sambar was given water to drink and some buckets were splashed over it.
 
 As word of it being spotted spread in the area, residents of  , that abuts the national park, gathered at the spot. The 200kg sambar was tranquilized, said Sanjay Gandhi National Park veterinary officer, Dr Shailesh Pethe. “At least 20 people lugged the bulky sambar through the narrow, congested lanes where our vehicle could not reach,” said Dr Pethe. “The dehydrated and stressed sambar has multiple lacerations on its body. It was administered intravenous dextrose saline.” It has been admitted to the national park’s wildlife rescue centre.
 
 Vyas said watering holes generally run dry as the heat rises. “Such instances are an annual phenomenon in forests around summer,” Vyas added.
 
 Wildlife conservationist Vidya Venkatesh said a temperature rise could cause heat stroke or   in wild animals. “But it is rather unusual for sambars to be found around human habitations. Maybe this one strayed out and could not find water,” Venkatesh added.
 
 National park authorities said the water level at the park has not dipped. “The level is the same as it is every year. The reason for this sambar could be different. Possibly due to an injury or immobility,” said Anwar Ahmed, director and chief conservator of forests,  .
