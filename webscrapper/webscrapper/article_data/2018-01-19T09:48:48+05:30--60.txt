 "We will gather tomorrow at 9.30am in Maruti Park opposite the school and march down to the CM's office to speak up against the school administration," said  , a parent whose child is friends with the injured student. 
 
 "The school's behaviour towards students is highly shameful and we condemn it. We will take it up with the CM," said Kumar. "The school has been evading responsibility and has failed to maintain security on all floors. It also did not inform the police. There should be a special investigation team for this case," said Singh.
 
 The school's management remained unavailable for comments despite several attempts. Its discipline in charge   said some students were checked by the school authorities but he did not know the details because he had been designated to look after the victim at KGMU from Tuesday.
