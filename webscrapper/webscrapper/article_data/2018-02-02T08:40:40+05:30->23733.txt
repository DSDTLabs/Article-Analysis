After she died, Sunita herself consumed the tablets when other family members had gone out on Wednesday afternoon. When family members came home, they found Aarvi dead and Sunita lying unconscious.

 During preliminary investigations, family members told Sarthana police that Sunita was extremely short-tempered and stubborn. There was no suicide note and police are yet to question them and Sunita’s parents in detail to ascertain the cause of such a ghastly step.
 
 Family members also told police that there was no serious dispute between Sunita and her husband Jignesh, who works at a textile embroidery unit. However, there used to be altercations due to her temperament and stubborn nature. 
 
 Police will also question the neighbours to find out more about the couple’s relationship.
