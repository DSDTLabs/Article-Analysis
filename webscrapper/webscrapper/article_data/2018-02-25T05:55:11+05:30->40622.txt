HYDERABAD:   was a picture of empty streets and locked doors on Friday after the twin fires and explosions forced nearly 200 people to vacate their houses. The lane behind   wore a haunted look. Three lanes behind the pharma unit, people were seen sitting on streets alongside water tanks to stave off an emergency. 

 "We are labourers. How can we lock doors and quit? We have to live here to earn and feed our family even if we live in fear of death," said Mohammed Azam.
 
 Residents said fire officials have asked them to take precautionary measures and move out from the accident area. "My daughter-in-law was washing dishes and we were about to go to bed when we heard another explosion at 11pm. We ran out and since then we are sleeping in the open. We are even scared to enter our homes," said Shaik Mohammed, another resident.
 
 Gampala Basti area has over 200 chemical and pharma factories, of which three units are close to their houses, said locals. They also claimed that every two months, at least one fire erupts in the factories.
 
 "These factories have been polluting groundwater, air and the streets by dumping industrial waste. Most of us suffer from breathing trouble due to 24x7 emissions from factories. Now, the area has become more dangerous," said  , another resident.
 
 Moving out of the area is not an option for these poor people. Most stay in rented houses and if they move out, they have to pay more rent. To ensure safety of children, some have sent family members to their friends' houses, 3km away.
 
 "We earn hardly Rs 200 per day and pay nearly Rs 1000 as rent. If we move out from here, we have to cough up at least Rs 3000 to 5000. We cannot afford that. We have no choice but to grovel in danger," said Rihana Begum, who sells utensils.
