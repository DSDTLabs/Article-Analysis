KOCHI: A leading lawyer recently sought the help of psychiatrist to admit a relative who is a schizophrenic for treatment. But the doctor refused saying that under the new mental healthcare bill, the patient would have to give permission to be treated. When the legal expert asked how it was possible, the doctor said, “Well, this is the new law.“

 One of the tricky chapters in the bill is the clause which states that a person can specify how he/she wished to be cared for and treated for a mental illness. The person can also give it in writing. Doctors say while this is understandable in cases of depression or anxiety, it is troubling in case of serious mental illnesses. “How can you a person with schizophrenia and psychotic disorder decide on whether he/she should be treated and how?,“ Dr  , chief psy chiatrist, Kusumagiri   Centre, Kakkanad.
 
 In a state, where most mentally-ill persons are looked after by the family.
 
 “Most often we are depend ent on the family to support us in managing the patient.
 
 Unlike in the West, our in-patient system relies on the by stander for care-giving. In case of mentally-ill patients, it is very important to ensure that they have medication regularly,“ said K P Jayaprakashan, secretary,   . Yet another cause of concern is the absence of clauses that deal with management of assets and properties of such persons. “It is very important because such persons are often cheated and thrown out of homes. Their rights are protected sometimes because the property is in their name too,“ said  , secretary, Kanivu an NGO that works with destitutes.
 
 The decision of decriminalisation of suicides is also problematic. “This should not give out a message that a homicide could be converted into a suicide. This can happen especially in cases of domestic violence or dowry torture which forces a person to suicide.So the states must insist on mental health treatment as a follow-up for attempted suicides,“ said Dr C J John, senior psychiatrist.
