New Delhi: “If A K Walia quits, it will be a big loss for the party,” former CM Sheila Dikshit said, acknowledging his seniority in Congress as well his contributions to her cabinet. 

 “What can I say? He has said it all. I can only say one thing that he has worked with me as a minister and he was good. If he leaves the party, it will be a big loss,” Dikshit said on Monday after Walia threatened to quit the party following disagreement with the leadership over ticket distribution for the municipal polls. 
 
 On being asked if she had experienced the same indifference from the party leadership, Dikshit chose to be cautious. “People can come and people can go in a party, but for me, Congress is the most important. As far as ticket distribution goes, they must have done what they thought was best,” she added.
 
 The former CM has not been projected at the forefront in Delhi politics by the party ever since Congress, led by Dikshit, lost in 2012 assembly elections. After the 2015 rout, Ajay Maken took charge of DPCC and the party seemed to be keeping Dikshit out of its revival strategy.
 
 Besides Diskhit, another former minister, Arvinder Singh Lovely, too came forward to speak in support of Walia. Lovely was the DPCC chief before Maken took over, after the 2015 assembly polls. 
 
 He said, “I agree tickets cannot be given to everyone, but if Dr Walia has felt the need to explore such an extreme step and spell out his thoughts, then certainly it reflects that his self-esteem has been hurt...As a Congressman, I would like to apologise to Dr Walia and would like to appeal to him that he is very important for the party. He has played a very important role in building the party in Delhi.”
