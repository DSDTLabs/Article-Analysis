MOHALI: A 72-year-old woman was approached to meet her relatives sitting in a car, pushed into the vehicle and robbed of her   bangles in Phase XI on Sunday. 

 Two out of the three accused are women. 
 
  Devi, a resident of Sector 43, Chandigarh, had gone to attend a religious meet organised by her relatives at   temple. The woman was accompanied by her family members. After the function, Shanti was standing outside the temple, when a woman asked her to come with her across the road to meet one of her relatives sitting in the car.
 
 A little hesitant, Shanti, however, decided to go along. But when she found the woman sitting in the car was not known to her, she tried to walk back. However, the accused woman pushed her inside and the man at the wheel started driving the vehicle. 
 
 When   resisted, they stopped at a distance from the temple, dumped her and sped away. 
 
 The victim realised that her gold bangles were missing and told her family members. 
 
 Police have registered a case under Section 379-B (punishment for theft) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
