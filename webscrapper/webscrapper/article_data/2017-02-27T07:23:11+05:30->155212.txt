NASHIK: The   could not swing the votes in the tribal areas in its favour in the  . 

 Eight of Nashik's 15 talukas are completely tribal areas and count for 34 seats (about 47%) in the 73-member ZP. Tribal development minister Vishnu Savra had camped in Igatpuri, Trimbakeshwar and   of the district, but could hardly make the voters shift their loyalties. 
 
 The BJP could improve its tally by just one seat here over its past performance. Its strong presence in Baglan taluka has ensured that the voters here always vote for the BJP. Apart from the four seats in Baglan, the only addition BJP could make was in Surgana.
 
 "We knew the time was ripe for the BJP. Hence, we ensured that we gave candidature to our workers on every seat in all talukas. We did try to make most of the situation but that did not happen. Instead of being dejected over the results, we are happy that we could reach every house in the belt with our symbol," Savra told TOI.
 
 Dada Jadhav, the BJP district unit president, said it was for the first time that the party was able to canvass for its candidates and this was just the beginning.
 
 "Nashik, Igatpuri and Trimbakeshwar fall in Nashik   constituency, and so the assembly seats, are contested by the Shiv Sena. Dindori assembly seat, though it falls in Dindori Lok Sabha contested by BJP, is also contested by the Shiv Sena. BJP had only Kalwan and Surgana talukas in its hand. We were never accessible to citizens with our party symbol. This was the first time when we took our symbol to all citizens," he said.
