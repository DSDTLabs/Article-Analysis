LUCKNOW: This Independence Day will spell a new kind of freedom for farmers in Uttar Pradesh. 

 On Thursday, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma announced in the Vidhan Parishad that the state government would get all farmer loans waived by August 15. The announcement came two days after the government allocated a budget of Rs 36,000 crore to pay off loans of   to Rs 1 lakh taken by small and marginal farmers. 
 
  A   for farmers, which is expected to benefit around 86 lakh people, was one of BJP's major promises during the campaign for the assembly elections, held earlier this year. Sharma said the verification of farmers' bank accounts would be completed by July 22, after which the process of money transfer would begin. He said farmers who had got their Aadhaar cards linked to their bank accounts would benefit in the first two phases. 
 
 "The case of the rest of the farmers would be taken up thereafter," he said. The deputy CM added that the state government had asked banks not to issue notice or take any action against farmers who defaulted on loans. 
 
 The loan waiver issue was raised in the legislative assembly after Congress legislator Dhruv Kumar Tripathi said the amount allocated in the budget was far from sufficient. 
 
 He claimed that the budget requirement for the purpose was no less than Rs 93,000 crore.
 
  The government has also decided to create a corporation for supplying medicines to government hospitals in the state. Health minister   said the decision was taken in view of drug shortage at some hospitals.
