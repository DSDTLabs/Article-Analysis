Panaji: The National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai, is likely conduct ‘ground truthing’ in October. 

 ‘Ground truthing’, which involves the physical verification of demarcated high tide lines and ecologically sensitive areas to prepare the coastal zone management plan, is likely to be completed in 45 days, after which the plan will be put in the public domain.
 
 The institute had submitted the new draft of the coastal zone management plan to the state government on May 9. The NCSCM, along with officials of the directorate of settlement and land records and of the forest, fisheries, agriculture and TCP departments, will carry out ‘ground truthing’. It was earlier executed through satellite maps, the accuracy of which will be physically verified. 
 
 The institute has informed the government that field verification has already been undertaken. However, to meet further requirements of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA), it will undertake further related work after the monsoon.
 
 Replying to a query by officials from the environment department, the NCSCM said water areas of CRZ IV have been demarcated according to hydrographic charts of the National Hydrographic Office (NHO). The NCSCM has also informed the government that it has requested the GCZMA/fisheries department to provide geo-referenced shape files/KML files or latitude/longitude coordinates in the WGS84 system of fishing zones, to demarcate fish-breeding areas.
 
 The environment department has proposed to write to the fisheries department seeking details available with it, such as a detailed proposal from the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute for identification of fish-breeding areas.
 
 Representatives of the NCSCM recently made constituency-wise presentations of the draft coastal zone management plan to MLAs and ministers, who had raised several objections.
