THANE: In a special kind of workshop, a voluntary group from Thane initiated a campaign to educate and sensitize children towards   and be their friends rather than hurting them. 

 The Pet Owners and Animal Lovers (PAL) had organised the workshop to educate children, as they feel that kids are the future and the young minds need to be sensitive towards the animals. The NGO so far has held over 30 such sessions for children in schools as well as orphanages.
 
 “Our aim is to make children understand about the animals’ behaviour. These children are our future and it is our responsibility to be sensitive about the pets and care for them,” said Aditi Nair from PAL.
 
 She said students in the age group of 6-14 participated in the workshops and were shown videos about the dogs’ habits and their behaviour. They were demonstrated on how to handle a dog with the help of their 13-month old   ‘Shimmer’. 
 
 “The workshop highlighted points like when to touch an animal and when not to disturb the animal. What makes them angry and when do they get comfortable. The kids were also given tips on how should they take care of cats, rabbits, birds and other animals,” said Nair.
 
 “The kids were explained that a dog will just never just bites anyone without a reason. There are three to four stages before a dog bites a person. They initially try to escape from the discomfort that they feels around a person. When that fails, they try to growl and if nothing works then they finally bite,” said Bhaskar Chauhan, canine behaviourist and trainer.
