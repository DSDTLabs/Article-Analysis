NEW DELHI: A first-half goal by forward   handed Spanish outfit   a 1-0 win over   side   in Oviedo, Spain.

 While Timothy Munmun Lugun made his way into the line-up after missing out against  .
 
 It was the home team that knocked on the doors in the initial stage, but a fine double save by goalkeeper Albino Gomes kept them at bay at the Estadio Carlos Tartiere.
 
 Veteran defender Cichero then came to the rescue as his last-ditch tackle five minutes later helped Delhi keep the scoreline intact.
 
 Real Oviedo's persistence paid off though in the 21st minute when Gonzales found his way past the defense to slot home the ball past a helpless Albino.
 
 Dynamos looked a lot more stable and co-ordinated better in the closing minutes of the first half, but failed to threaten Oviedo's goal as the home side headed into the break with the advantage.
 
 Portugal made eight changes to the Dynamos line-up in the second half. Brazilian midfielder Paulinho made his way onto the pitch and he almost made an instant impact, but his shot from distance hit the crossbar.
 
 Despite having more possession in the second half, Oviedo rarely threatened Delhi's defense.
 
 With little chances to show for in the final 45 minutes, the game finished 1-0 in favour of the Spanish Second Division outfit.
