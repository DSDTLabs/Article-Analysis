PANAJI: In a setback to those trying to delay execution of   orders that attained finality, the high court of Bombay at Goa has quashed a district court order which decided a matter without having power to do so. 
 
 The petitioner, Silvester Dâ€™Souza had complained to   panchayat that his neighbour had constructed a second floor despite his structure being within 200m of the high-tide line, violating coastal regulation zone norms. 
  
 The panchayat had passed an order of demolition on January 28, 2010, which was later confirmed by the district judge on July 30, 2011. The respondent had not challenged it further, and thus the order attained finality. 
  
 On October 29, 2011, the Calangute panchayat wrote to the block development officer ,  , requisitioning a demolition squad. The respondent challenged the order before various authorities, including the district court to delay the proceedings. The district judge, in an order dated July 15, 2015, allowed the appeal while setting aside the order of additional director of panchayat to restore the demolition order. 
  
 Calangute panchayat had also passed a resolution rescinding the order of demolition. 
  
 The single bench comprising Justice C V   ruled that the district judge had committed a patent illegality in sending the file back to additional panchayat director. Further, the HC directed the panchayat to go ahead with the execution of the demolition order.
