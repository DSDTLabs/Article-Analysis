The singers crooned some delightful numbers that regaled the doctors who were present in good numbers. Riya rendered romantic numbers like 'Lag Ja Gale', 'Moh Moh Ke Dhage' and 'Agar Tum Saath Ho'. She then went on to sing a medley of pacy songs like 'Bulleya', 'Jugani' and 'Jag Ghoomeya'. Vishal sang numbers with Banaras in mind like 'Bhole O Bhole'.
Some doctors too joined the singers. Dr   rendered raag-based song '  Na' while   chipped in for the song 'Jo Teri Khatir Tadape'.
