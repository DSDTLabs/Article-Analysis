THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The mortal remains of writer M  , who breathed his last on Friday following a prolonged respiratory illness and heart ailment, was cremated at   on Saturday evening. 

 People from all walks of life, including chief minister  , paid their last respects. Sukumaran, who refused to flaunt the writer's charisma, preferred to speak to his audience only through the written word. He never turned up for public meetings. He did not even turn up at functions where he was supposed to receive central and state academy awards.
 
 Known for his sharp intellect, fiery writings and communist moorings, Sukumaran successfully brought politics to Malayalam fiction and marvelled his readers.
 
 He was a gentleman without a grouse and when he stopped writing, he hardly said anything about his silence, recounted filmmaker M P   who made a film titled Kazhakam, based on one of his short story. Those who asked him about his silence got the same reply: "I have said what I have to say. I don't write since I have nothing more to tell."
 
 Sukumaran was dismissed from central government service in 1974 for his trade union activities. A native of Chittur in  , he chose Thiruvananthapuram as his second home in 1963, the year he joined service in AG's office. A staunch advocate of Left politics, his sharp criticism against the attitude of communist parties earned him foes in the communist party.
 
 CPM ousted him in 1979 after he refused to stop serializing his novel 'Sheshakriya', (funeral rites) which hit hard against the rot in the party. 
 
 "Even when he quarrelled with progressive political organizations at times, he upheld his humanitarian stand. His death is a great loss to Malayalam literature and language," said veteran leader VS Achuthanandan.
