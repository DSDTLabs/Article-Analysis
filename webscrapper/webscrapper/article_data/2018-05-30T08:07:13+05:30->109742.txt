BENGALURU: Nearly 300 parents of kids enrolled in Presidency School, Kasturi Nagar, protested against the authorities on Tuesday for allegedly forcing them to pay an arbitrary annual fee running into thousands of rupees.

 
 They held placards and raised slogans calling for abolishment of the fee that is pegged at Rs 41,000 for this academic session. They claimed the fee has been increasing by Rs 5,000 every year since 2013 and there’s no clear indication how it is being utilized. The school lacks basic infrastructure like playground and clean restrooms, they rued.
 
 Mithila Umesh, a resident of Kalyan Nagar, said: “Both the annual and tuition fees have increased. With the annual fee being collected in the name of AH Memorial Trust, we wonder why we are being forced to pay to a trust when we are already paying tuition fee.” C Usha from Channasandra, who was looking to enrol her child into playgroup, said she backed out as the fee of Rs 1,60,000 was unaffordable.“Along with the existing term and annual fees, there’s an admission fee of Rs 60,000 for fresh admissions. Transport, uniforms and books cost extra,” she said.
 
  said the issue is being discussed with trustees. “It’s an ongoing process and we will alert parents of any development by June 4,” Thangadurai added.
