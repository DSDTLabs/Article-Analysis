Since the races will be held on dunes, Indian Baja Dakar Challenge series gave me the right platform to finetune my skills ahead of Merzouga. When I started my career, I never imagined even in my wildest of dreams that I would come this far. It’s all because of my parents support and hard work that I am able to achieve it.” Tanveer, who is having a golden run this year, after winning the National Rally Championship and Super Cross Championship, doesn’t have specific plans for the upcoming rally. He adds, “As usual, I will keep myself fit. I don’t want to put too much pressure on myself by concentrating on preparation. I know that the competition is going to be stiff, as many top riders from across the world will participate, but I just want to soak in the moment.”
