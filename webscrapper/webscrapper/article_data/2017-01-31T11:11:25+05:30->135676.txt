GUWAHATI: The   of   on Monday questioned   and   Gautam Roy in connection with a Rs 2250-crore scam in the social welfare department. 

 Roy held the office of social welfare minister twice - (2001-2005) and (2015-2016). He is the second Congress minister from that period to be quizzed by the investigating agency. A few days ago Akon Bora, who had also headed the department, was questioned by police. 
 
 After a four-hour-long interrogation, Roy came out from the vigilance office and displayed his usual carefree attitude before the media. He just said, "I am not afraid as I am not involved in any kind of corruption."
 
 Sources said huge financial anomalies in the name of allotting tenders and purchasing study materials for children of anganwadi centers in the state happened during his tenure. "Tenders were floated and work was allotted to Roy's favoured candidates," said a source.
 
 So far, the investigating agency has quizzed at least 26 people, including the two ministers and IAS officers. 
 
 The vigilance and anti-corruption wing has started a probe into the alleged scam on the orders of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal after a departmental inquiry revealed that Rs 150 crore was allegedly swindled annually in the name of supplying nutritious food to some nine lakh children and anganwadi centres wich 'never' existed or were ghost beneficiaries for 15 years. 
 
 Sources said another former minister, Ajanta Neog, has also been summoned by the investigating agency in connection with the case. She is likely to be quizzed on February 5. Eight former directors of the department were also asked to appear before the investigating team.
 
 Investigation has so far revealed government funds were swindled in the name of some nine lakh 'ghost beneficiaries' and about 390 fake anganwadi centers.   Police has already increased manpower of its investigating team to scrutinize the files of the department.
