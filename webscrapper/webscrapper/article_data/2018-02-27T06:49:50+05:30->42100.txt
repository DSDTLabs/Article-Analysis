AHMEDABAD: It was face-off between   cops and girls working for a private caterer who was detained by cops under section 151 of IPC. While the girls claimed that cops behaved rudely with them and one of them even slapped them, the cops said that the girls thrashed a woman PSI.

 Naroda police officials said they have registered a case against the girls who created a ruckus at the police station on Sunday night. But the girls maintained that the cops misbehaved with them. 
 
 According to them the cops have not taken their complaint as it was against their own men. According to sources, residents of a housing society had submitted a written complaint against   who runs a catering business. “Some members of the society claimed that Puvar was creating nuisance in the society. Based on the complaint, we had detained Puvar under section 151 of the IPC,” said a senior police official. “Soon, a group of girls working with Puvar gathered near the police station and created a ruckus. The woman PSI they attacked is believed to have sustained a fracture.”
 
 Additional commissioner of police, Sector 2, Ashok   said that after lodging the complaint against the girls, three of them were arrested. “Most of the girl who had gathered near the police station are from other states. Their behaviour was very rude,” Yadav said.
