NEW DELHI:   has a chance to grab the Orange Cap for most runs from   when Kings XI Punjab face the eliminated Royal Challengers Bangalore in Monday’s   fixture at the Holkar Stadium in Indore, while his team-mate Andrew Tye will look to extend his lead on the bowling table over his nearest rival, Hardik Pandya. 

 
 
 
 Rahul’s superb form in   2018 has seen him sit at third place on the batting charts with 537 from 11 innings, at a strike-rate of 162.72. Ahead of him are Sunrisers Hyderabad captain Kane Williamson (544) and Orange Cap holder Pant (582). Rahul is 45 runs shy of Pant, and given RCB’s bowling woes he can eye the prize with another good innings. 
 
  captain   (466 runs) can also move up the table, perhaps even becoming the fifth batsman to reach 500 runs after Pant, Williamson, Rahul, Ambati Rayudu (535) and Jos Buttler (509). 
 
 Tye and Pandya have swapped places at the top of the season bowling charts following the Australian pace bowler’s successive four-wicket hauls for KXIP. Tye has 20 wickets to Pandya’s 18, and with   in action today, the Australian pace bowler has a chance to gain ground on the Indian allrounder. 
 
 Pandya had lost the Purple Cap to Tye last Wednesday after the latter had taken four wickets in KXIP’s loss to Rajasthan Royals.
