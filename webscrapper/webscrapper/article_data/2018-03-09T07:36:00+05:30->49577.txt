BARNALA: In a bid to remind the Amarinder Singh government of its pre-poll promise of complete farm debt waiver, more than 20,000 activists of farmers’ organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) on Thursday assembled at the grain market here. They organised ‘Lalkar’ rally to mark the completion of one year of the   rule in   and warned the state government to implement its promise.

 In the next step of protests, the farmers announced to hold a massive rally by seven peasant outfits on April 3 in Chandigarh. They also accused the Narendra Modi-led NDA government of misleading farmers with claims of doubling their farm income and providing 50% profit over input costs. The farm leaders equated the Congress government in Punjab with the previous SAD-BJP regime in meting out injustice to farmers. They said earlier the Parkash Singh Badal government pushed the small and marginal farmers to the brink of committing suicides and toeing the same line, the current government was no better as it had dashed all hopes of farmers of getting a complete debt waiver.
 
 The farmers asked small peasants to be vigilant as their money in banks might not be safe, hinting at Nirav Modi. They said the banks might deduct funds from their accounts for frauds committed by certain corporates.
 
 President of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan)   and general secretary   said the Amarinder government had failed in keeping its word of waiving the farm debt. “We will not let this government befool farmers with lofty promises. Even the Union government is writing off loans of corporates worth lakhs of crores but have not kept even a penny for farm debt waiver,” they said.   further said that Punjab farmers had nearly Rs 1 lakh crore debt whereas farmers across the nation have Rs 12 lakh crore amount pending against them. He said nearly 4 lakh farmers had committed suicides in India in the last 10 years whereas more than 20,000 peasants had ended lives in Punjab.
