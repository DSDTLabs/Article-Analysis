Fans of   and   seem to be lodged in a cyber war. Over the last two days, the dislikes on Bunny’s Duvvada Jagannadham’s (DJ’s) teaser and on PK’s Katamarayudu’s teaser have seen a spike. While DJ’s teaser with over 74,900 dislikes has now reportedly become the most disliked teaser in Tollywood, Katamarayudu has earned 5,000 more dislikes, by Sunday afternoon, since Bunny’s teaser released. 
The relationship between the two fan groups have been on the rocks ever since Allu Arjun responded with: “Cheppanu brother,” to the frenzied Pawan Kalyan fans who wanted the actor to praise their hero at an award function last year. The now trending ‘dislike’ war, however, has roots in another message that’s gone viral. A screengrab that’s been doing the rounds on phones has Bunny’s brother Allu Sirish pointing fingers at “Kalyan gadi fans” over a meme. Although the authenticity of the screengrab is questionable, that was trigger enough for the Allu clan to take offense and engage in this ‘dislike’ war.
