NAINITAL: As many as 44 resorts and hotels near   are encroaching on government land, an affidavit submitted to the high court by the chief secretary has said.
 
  While 30 properties were found violating norms by encroaching upon revenue land, 14 have encroached upon forest land, including encroaching upon the catchment areas of Kosi river. The affidavit submitted by chief secretary   said that cases dating back to 2010 have been registered against these resorts by the area’s DFO. The cases are pending in the sub-divisional magistrate’s court.
  
  The affidavit was submitted to the division bench of chief justice K M Joseph and Sharad Kumar Sharma earlier this week.
  
  In February, this year, taking a strict stand against encroachment in CTR, the court had directed the chief secretary to file a detailed affidavit on the number of resorts in the vicinity of CTR and how many of them were violating norms. The court’s directions came in response to a PIL alleging deterioration of the environment around   and seeking a regulation on commercial activities around the national park.
  
  The petition was filed by Mayank Mainali, chairperson of Ramnagar-based NGO, Himalayan Yuva Gramin Vikas Sanstha, in 2012.
  
  The petitioner, Mainali, told TOI that the hotels and resorts were dumping waste into Kosi river which is considered the lifeline of CTR.
  
  “Many hotels and resorts have been built by encroaching upon forest land, including the riverbed of Kosi,” said the petitioner.
  
  Dushyant Mainali, counsel for the petitioner, told TOI that the court had expressed discontent over the report of the sub-divisional magistrate of Ramnagar on encroachments by hotels and resorts adjacent to CTR in February and directed the chief secretary to file an affidavit in the matter.
  
  Paritosh Verma, sub-divisional magistrate, Ramnagar, said, “Complaints on the alleged encroachment are pending and are being dealt with.”
