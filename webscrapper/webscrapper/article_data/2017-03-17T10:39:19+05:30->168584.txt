JAMSHEDPUR: Chaos broke out outside Kerala Public School (KPS), Kadma, on Thursday after 75 out of 100 students of Class IX were detained in class due to poor performance in the annual examination.

 Parents of the detained children accused the school of poor management and sought an explanation as to why extra classes were not conducted to improve the students’ grades. The group also demanded that their children be promoted to the next class. 
 
 “It is little surprising to see only 25 percent of the students are fit to be promoted and that a large number got poor grades,” Gopal Singh, one of the parents, said.
 
 Likewise, another parent Binod Kumar said, “At least the school should chalk out some strategy to ensure that those who have failed gets another opportunity to perform better and pass.”
 
 Jamshedpur Abhivavak Sangh (JAS), a city-based group of the parents of school goers, led the protests and claimed the practice of detaining students in class nine has been continuing for several years. 
 
 “KPS is a leading English medium school. The school management should find out as to why a large number of students fail to perform year after year. Perhaps, there’s something wrong in the delivery mechanism as far as imparting lessons to the children in the classroom is concerned,” JAS convenor and RTE activist Umesh Kumar said.
 
 KPS Trust director Sharat Chandran assured to look into the matter and take a decision on the detained students by Monday.
