HYDERABAD: The severity of   in the city’s Hi-Tec corridor has only compounded this year. Residents are now shelling out increased ‘maintenance charges’ for water tanker service.

 “The maintenance for our apartment has been increased from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 per month for round the clock  .

 Tanker suppliers are a happy lot with orders pouring in despite the average temperatures hovering around 30-32 degree Celsius this month due to occasional rainfall.
 
 However, they say that going by the current demand, many small suppliers will have to turn away orders by another month. “While we expect the demand to go drastically increase during summers, going by the current demand it is very likely that we will have to refuse many in the days to come. Currently, we are sending out 50 tankers to residential areas each day,” said Ramaiah from Bhavani tanker service in Nanakramguda.
 
 In areas which were largely dependent on underground water, new bores have been a failure say insiders. These include areas like BHEL, Nallagandla and Manikonda. “Over the fortnight attempts at boring turned out to be failures,” said a resident of BHEL area.
 
 Also, power outages which are frequent in these areas also affect the water supply, as pumping is delayed, increasing dependence on tankers. “While we required a tanker every week in addition to Manjeera water supply earlier, now we are ordering one every three days due to frequent power cuts,” said a
