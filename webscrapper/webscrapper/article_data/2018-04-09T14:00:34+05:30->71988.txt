PUDUCHERRY: The   petition filed by government whip R K R Anantharaman against the   for failing to constitute the   and   water regulatory committee will come up for hearing before the   on Monday, said chief minister V  .

 Speaking to reporters on Sunday, he outlined the initiatives undertaken by the Congress government to press the Centre to constitute the board and committee for ensuring that Cauvery water is shared among  , Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. He pointed out that lt governor Kiran Bedi did not accord permission to the government to file a contempt petition against the Union government whereas Tamil Nadu being a state had filed one against the Centre before the Supreme Court.
 
 He said the government has submitted memorandums and copies of resolutions passed in the legislative assembly and all-party meetings to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others urging them to expedite the process to constitute the board and committee. He regretted that Modi had not responded to the plea so far. 
 
 Narayanasamy came down heavily on the ruling AIADMK party in Tamil Nadu for blaming the Congress party in the Cauvery row instead of taking proactive measures in pressing the Centre. Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam said the DMK party despite being a part of the previous Congress-led UPA government in the Centre betrayed farmers in the state.
 
 He said Puducherry had been let down by both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu on water-sharing issues. “The board and committee are our only viable options. Our priority is to protect farmers of Karaikal as they depend on Cauvery water,” he said.
