THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After weighing pros and cons in detail, the   finally demanded a reprobe into the Thalassery   case. The CPM state secretariat on Friday asked the   to reinvestigate the case based on fresh evidence and bring the real culprits before the law.

 Fazal, who was an NDF worker at Thalassery, was found murdered on October 22, 2006. Though CPM alleged that the murder was committed by RSS, the CBI which probed the case found that the murder was a handiwork of CPM workers. They arrested eight CPM workers including senior leaders   and Karayi Chandrasekharan. The CBI has also filed chargesheet against them in the court.
 
 In November, last year, RSS worker Subeesh who was arrested by the state police in connection with another case confessed his role in the case and said the murder of Fazal was carried out by a gang of four RSS workers. The Kerala police have handed over the confession statement of Subeesh and related evidence to CBI. On Tuesday, TOI reported about the fresh evidence in Fazal murder case and the silence of CPM on the new development.
 
 “There is a Supreme Court order that says an investigating agency can reopen a probe even in a case which has been closed if there is fresh evidence. It is the CBI which needs to take a decision to reopen Fazal murder case. The CBI court should also initiate steps to reopen the probe,” said a statement issued by the CPM state secretariat.
 
 The CPM said Popular Front, which had unilaterally blamed the CPM for the murder, has now demanded that the real culprits should be brought before the law. 
 
 The CPM also said the issue of human rights violation against its leader Karayi Rajan and Karayi Chandrasekharan who couldn’t visit their home towns for over four years also needs to be discussed. “They spent two-and-a-half years in prison and now live in Ernakulam. They can’t move out of the district and their right to work for a living has been compromised,” the statement noted.
