NAVI MUMBAI: Most playing equipments at   in sector 18 of   are in a bad shape. Residents have been complaining that the broken playthings are dangerous for the kids. But civic officials are yet to take note of the deplorable condition of the park.

 According to locals, children have been deprived of outdoor activities in the civic garden as there is no maintenance. The absence of a custodian to look after the playthings and the garden has made matters worse, they say. 
 
 Children have reportedly got hurt while playing with these equipments.
 
 “The slide has been damaged and children have got stuck in the broken part and got bruised. Lodging complaints with the local ward office has not helped,” said Sanket Patil, a resident.
 
 A number of gymming instruments too are are in a bad shape, allege residents. “This is a waste of taxpayers’ money,” said Ajay Samel, a regular jogger.
 
 Elders have been asking for a security guard and a gardener. “It has become a paradise for miscreants. We want the civic authorities to take action immediately, said Aruna Magar, a resident. 
 
 Additional civic commissioner   told TOI that he has spoken to local officials.
