AHMEDABAD: A former member of the Passenger Service Committee of the Railway Board, Nagesh  , has urged the board to extend the run of the Gandhinagar-Indore   up to Rajkot. 

 Namjoshi said that the train will terminate at Ahmedabad till April 30 as the re-development of the   station is under way. 
 
 This train will lie in the yard for 12 hours before making the return journey to Indore.
 
 "Instead, the railways should extend the facility till Rajkot on an experimental basis. If the railways gets adequate passenger traffic, it should think of extending the service to Rajkot permanently," he said. 
 
 Namjoshi said there is adequate traffic from Indore for Rajkot as people visit Dwarka and Somnath. But because there is no direct connectivity, passengers disembark at Ahmedabad and change trains or travel further by road.
 
 Namjoshi said that if the railways gets adequate passenger traffic for Rajkot, it can divide the train into two - while one section can go to Gandhinagar, the other can be routed to Rajkot. He said that the train to Gandhinagar from Ahmedabad often draws only ten passengers. He said that the proposed plan can get additional income for the railways.
