MUMBAI: The Income-Tax department recently scrutinised the assets and properties of controversial BJP leader and former revenue minister  , his wife Mandakini and daughter-in-law, Raksha, who is the   from Raver constituency in   district.

 Khadse confirmed to TOI that the I-T department scrutinised his assets and properties as well as those of his family members. “I was told that it was a routine scrutiny,” Khadse said.
 
 Meanwhile, at a public meeting in Jalgaon district on Thursday, Khadse came down heavily on the state BJP leadership, saying that for obvious political reasons, he was being driven out of the party. “I have been out of the government for the last 20 months; I have never approached the party leadership for re-induction into the state cabinet. On Wednesday, I called on senior BJP leaders to know what my fault was. All along I have been painted like a villain. This is unfortunate for a leader like me who nurtured the organisation in the whole of northern Maharashtra,” Khadse said.
 
 The ex-minster said he had been accused of illegally procuring MIDC land, and allegations of corruption and irregularities were made against him, but no agency had been able to prove his guilt. “I want an answer from the BJP leadership. If I am guilty, send me to jail or hang me. The ACB conducted a probe on three occasions but was unable to establish that I was guilty or corrupt,” he said.
 
 The meeting, organised to felicitate  , was presided over by state Congress president Ashok Chavan who gave an open offer to Khadse to join Congress. “I have seen many leaders, but Khadse is one of the politicians with selfrespect. If he joins Congress, we will give him a red carpet welcome,” he said.
