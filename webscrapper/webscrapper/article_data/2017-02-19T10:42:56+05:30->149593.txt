CHARMINAR: Weeks after candidates were elected to the   unopposed, there is no clarity over when the Muslim endowments panel will be officially constituted. The delay is said to be on account of prolonged negotiations between the ruling   (TRS) and   (MIM).

 The 10-member board was scheduled to have six elected members and another four nominated members. Those in know pointed out that the MIM, at present, has four party-backed elected members: parliamentarian Asaduddin Owaisi, legislator Moazzam Khan, Muslim member of bar council Zakir Hussain Javid and from the mutawalli and managing committee category,  . Sources said that the issue causing the delay is the lack of consensus over those who have to be proposed as members of the board in the nominated category. Both parties are unable to come to an agreement.
 
 “The two had settled for fo ur elected members out of the six for the MIM. This would leave the other two seats for the TRS. Later it was agreed that two nominated members would be left for the MIM to decide,“ said a source who did not wish to be identified.
 
 Another source pointed out that now there is a disagreement between the MIM and TRS over which party would nominate the two persons to the board. “While the MIM was supposed to nominate two members, the status now is not clear. We will have to wait for further talks,“ the source said.
