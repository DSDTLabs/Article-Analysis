BENGALURU:  , chairman of Percept Live, the live entertainment division of   which owns  , among other intellectual properties, answered questions from TOI about the incident that’s certainly added fire to the already tenuous situation surrounding Bengaluru’s image as a city unsafe for women.

 
 
 
 A: We don’t know what really happened for them to deny us permission, and people can interpret the statement in their own way. We know they said ‘No’ and it’s not within my reasoning or rights to ask them why they refused. The statement (we issued) could have been misunderstand and so, we are reframing it.
 
 
 
 
 Let me give you an insight about how we work. Percept has a long history of organizing concerts, Sunburn itself is a 10-year-old property, and talking of permissions, we always get it late because of the process involved. We’ve got to have the logistics, security, layout of the arena in place, as law and order authorities cannot give permission without validating our preparedness. If you were wondering why we can’t rent a venue a month in advance, it is because that would turn out to be expensive. Also, getting authorities to say ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ depends on that moment. I mean, I could get permission a month in advance but if something untoward or unexpected happens closer to the event, it will get cancelled. It’s a risk attached to the business and for over 100 events that we organize every year, one or two concerts like these getting cancelled is normal.
 
 
 
 
 We love Bengaluru. Everybody, be it the fans or the authorities, have been incredibly supportive. We are going to keep coming back.
