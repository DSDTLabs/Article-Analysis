Panaji: A fleet of 10 advanced ambulances are set to be commissioned by chief minister Manohar Parrikar as soon as he arrives from his US visit next week. 

 Health minister Vishwajit Rane said five more such vehicles, together with one VVIP  , would be added to the fleet by the end of August.
 
 The advanced ambulances, Rane said, are equipped with modern lifesaving equipment such as an i-STAT diagnostic device, which can be used to conduct critical tests of blood, electrolytes, metabolites and coagulations on the go. 
 
 “With just two drops of blood, one can have 29 different parameters checked while the ambulance is in motion,” the health minister said. The vehicles are also equipped with Wi-fi technology, enabling quick contact between paramedics and the call centre. 
 
 The state health ministry is also working to replace old ambulances with 14 new ones under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM).
 
 As declared earlier, Rane said the ministry would also commission 20 motorcycle ambulances by the first week of August. While it desired to have them operating by the end of this month, the deadline was altered slightly, he said.
 
 “Motorcycle ambulances will help reduce response time and save more lives in the process,” Rane explained, adding that a process is under way to have cardiac ambulances with doctors on board 24x7.
