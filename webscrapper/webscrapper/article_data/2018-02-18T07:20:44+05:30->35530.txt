AMRITSAR:   ( ) and the Amritsar district administration are on high alert ahead of Canadian Prime Minister  's visit to the   on February 21. 

 Although the authorities are tight-lipped about the security arrangements, sources told TOI that their biggest challenge will be to ensure that Sikh radical groups don't raise slogans about   during the visit.
 
 Reacting to apprehensions that some radical groups could sneak a bunch of their supporters into the Golden Temple in the guise of devotees ahead of Trudeau's visit, a senior SGPC functionary told TOI, "We have alerted our task force to keep an eye on any suspicious movement which could embarrass us." 
 
 Sources said that SGPC might not give a formal memorandum to Trudeau on Sikh-related issues in Canada, but would take up cases of racial attacks against Sikhs there. "Sikhs live in large numbers in Canada and are fairly integrated into Canadian society, but some instances of racial attacks on our religious places are worrisome. We will definitely draw Trudeau's attention to this," said an SGPC member. Sources said that it was yet undecided whether to bestow a siropa (robe of honour) upon Trudeau in the sanctum sanctorum of the Golden Temple or at the information centre of the Sikh shrine.
 
 Meanwhile, Amritsar district administration held a meeting on Saturday to chalk out plans and security arrangements for Trudeau's visit. Amritsar deputy commissioner Kamaldeep Singh Sangha said that he held meeting with officials of different departments including police. He has given directions for the immediate repair of roads, removal of hoardings and unauthorized rehris.
 
 SGPC chief secretary Dr Roop Singh discounted the possibility of anyone disrupting Trudeau's visit. The MP from Quebec province of Canada, Anju Dhillon, paid obeisance at the Golden Temple on Saturday.
