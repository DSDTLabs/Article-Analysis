KANNUR: The general secretary of  ,  , is   hunger strike in front of the civil station here demanding a   visit the houses of dalits. 

 He said the 'Thiruvayudham Ezhunnallathu' of more-than-a-century-old Azhikkal Pampadi Aalinkeezhil temple skips dalit households, even as it visits the residences of Hindus belonging to other communities.
 
 Sunilkumar, also a dalit activist, said the temple, belonging to the Thiyya community, has been governed by local CPM workers.
 
 "This is a case of untouchability, and in violation of the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955. The authorities, including the administration and police, have sidelined the issue despite registering a case in 2015," he said.
 
 The police are yet to file a chargesheet in the case.
 
 He said his campaign against the ritual skipping dalit households would continue even after the hunger strike.
 
 Sunilkumar claimed the district collector had in a meeting convened on February 2, 2015, directed that the procession be taken to all houses, irrespective of the caste of the residents.
 
 Meenakshi K, a local resident, said the discrimination has been traumatic, especially for children. As many as 32 students of the locality had lodged a police complaint in 2015. "Nothing happened," she said.
 
 The temple governing body said dalits are allowed into the temple. "The Thiruvayudham Ezhunnallathu is taken to the houses of those communities associated with the temple rites and dalits have no role in it. We cannot change it overnight," said temple committee president Mullankandi Mukundan.
