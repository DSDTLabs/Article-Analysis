VIJAYAWADA: Even as TDP continued to protest over poor allocations for   in Budget 2018-19, Union home minister   met a party delegation on Monday and assured them that he would discuss their grievances with Prime Minister  .

 The delegation, comprising Union ministers — P Ashok Gajapathi Raju and YS Chowdary — and MPs — K Ramamohan Naidu, Nimmala Kistappa and Thota Narasimham — met Singh in New Delhi. The meeting took place following a telephonic conversation between Singh and Naidu on Sunday. 
 
 The MPs, according to sources, expressed their displeasure over the “injustice meted out to AP in the Union Budget”. Singh sought time from the MPs to convey their message to the PM. “I will convey your feelings to the Prime Minister and ensure that the issues raised by you are addressed,” Singh told the TDP delegation.
 
 Earlier in the day, the MPs staged protests outside Parliament seeking justice for AP. Holding placards and raising slogans, like ‘Save Andhra Pradesh’, ‘Keep Your Promises Now’, ‘Follow Alliance Dharma’, ‘Implement AP Reorganisation Commitments’, they demanded that PM Modi address their concerns.
 
 Machilipatnam MP   said TDP would continue to hold protests until the Centre implemented the AP Reorganisation Act. TDP’s strategy was finalised at a teleconference that Naidu had with the MPs on Monday morning. “There should be no compromise on the state’s interests,” was the brief given to them. Congress Rajya Sabha MPs, led by KVP  , also protested in the House seeking justice, forcing RS chairman M   to adjourn the House.
