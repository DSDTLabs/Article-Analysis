AHMEDABAD: The central government on Monday told   that an inquiry report has proved the complaint made by a practising advocate against a   of the  , Ahmedabad (CAT), wrong.

 An advocate, Sunita Chaturvedi, has been seeking the removal of CAT judicial member  , on the grounds that he is “incompetent”. She complained in her petition before the HC that the judge acts as both a judge and a lawyer in certain cases, and even adjudicates his own drafted petitions. She requested that the HC direct an inquiry against him under section 9(2)(3) of the Administrative Tribunals Act.
 
 In February, the HC asked the Centre to show the status of the inquiry against the judge. According to Chaturvedi’s advocate, Kiran Shah, the Centre submitted a reply stating that an inquiry report reveals that the complaint against the CAT judge does not hold water, but there is no report attached to the reply. Moreover, the statement was made by the CAT’s deputy registrar, who is not a competent authority to make such a statement.
 
 Shah further said that the Centre’s reply without an annexure showing how it arrived to the conclusion is nothing but a tactic to waste the court’s precious time.
 
 Meanwhile, an All India Radio (AIR) employee Ravindar Parmar also approached the HC, demanding an inquiry against the CAT judge on the basis of various complaints. He claimed that a division bench in CAT granted a stay on his transfer, but judge Nagrajan vacated the stay in connivance with the department. He made various complaints to the central government, which did not act. He finally moved the HC last year, with a complaint that the CAT judge worked in a partial and autocratic manner.
