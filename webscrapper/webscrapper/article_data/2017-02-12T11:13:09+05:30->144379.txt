GUWAHATI: The Kamrup (Metro) district administration has set April 30 as the deadline for the construction of guard walls in Nabin Nagar and Anil Nagar. These areas are low-lying and get flooded during monsoon. The proposed guard walls will prevent the water of the Bharalu from entering these areas. 

 Deputy commissioner and chairman of the district disaster management authority, M Angamuthu, has asked the   (GMC) and the   (GMDA) to extend full support to the project.
 
 "We have been seeking steps to control artificial floods for a long time but hardly any solution was offered," said Ramen Hazarika, a resident of Anil Nagar.
 
 Angamuthu has asked the concerned department to submit a report after cleaning the Basistha, Bharalu, Mora Bharalu, Bahini and Bondajaan canals within a week. He has also asked the authorities to ensure that contaminated water from the city does not flow to the Deepor Beel. 
 
 Recently, more than 20 highly endangered greater adjutant storks were found dead near the water body.
