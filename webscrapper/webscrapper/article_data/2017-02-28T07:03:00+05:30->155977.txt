Dharamshala: Tibetans celebrated the first day of the Tibetan lunar new year, Losar, on Monday. Special prayers were held in the morning at Tsuglagkhang temple, close to the official palace of the Dalai Lama at McLeodganj. Monday was the first day of the Tibetan lunar new year 2144. 

 Speaking on the occasion, Tibetan Prime Minister-in-exile Lobsang Sangay expressed concern over the plight of people of Tibet. “Those of us who are in exile should be aware of it and summon courage and determination to carry forward the Tibetan freedom movement, based on truth, justice and non-violence,” said Sangay. 
 
 The number of Tibetans coming to India has declined. Official sources here said that about 212 new Tibetan refugees were registered here last year, including 113 who came on special entry permit through Nepal border.
