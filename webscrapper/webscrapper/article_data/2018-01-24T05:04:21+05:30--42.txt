MUMBAI: A day after an 84-year-old farmer,  , allegedly tried to commit suicide inside the Mantralaya building, his son charged the government with apathy and neglect. 

 According to his son, Patil had been running from pillar to post seeking better compensation for his five-acre plot for which he only got Rs 4 lakh as against his neighbour who got nearly Rs 1.89 crore for two acres. Private land was being acquired for a thermal power plant. However, it is now a solar power plant project.
 
 Patil, who hails from Vikharan village in Dhule district, had come to Mantralaya with his son Narendra on Monday to submit a letter to the chief minister's office. 
 
 "I went to give the letter to the CM's office and, after I came out, my father said he was feeling giddy. The security staff offered him tea and that is when he started vomiting," said Narendra. He was rushed to St George Hospital. "On the way, he told me he had consumed poison," he added.
 
 Meanwhile, Patil's continued to deteriorate and he was moved to JJ Hospital on Tuesday evening. It is learnt that Patil has "acute kidney injury", possibly the result of the poison. He also has infection in his lungs.
 
 On Tuesday, tourism minister Jaykumar Rawal, who is the legislator from Dhule, said a crucial meeting to give them a good rate was organised on Wednesday.
 
 Meanwhile, energy minister   said the government was considering giving Patil Rs 10 lakh per hectare as well as interest accrued since 2012.
