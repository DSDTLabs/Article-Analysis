MANGALURU: Despite opposition from environmentalists, trees were felled under tight police security on Wednesday on the outskirts of the city to facilitate construction of a new deputy commissioner’s office complex.

 The felling of tree with the help of wood cutting saw machine began early in the morning. However, none was allowed to enter the territory as it was cordoned-off by police personnel, according to   Ramesh, an advocate.
 
 She said that trees are being axed after the Tree Officer gave sanction. The proposal to build a new DC office complex for   requires cutting of more than 666 trees on nearly six acres at Alake village in  . “The order was passed on Tuesday night and the tree felling began next day early morning. We were not allowed to file objection on the same,” said Suma adding that they have tried all legal ways to stop tree felling, which is a hazard to environment.
 
 Asked how many trees being cut on first day, she said it was not possible to cut since they were not allowed inside the premises. “As per order only 202 trees are allowed to cut but we are totally clueless on how many trees will be axed since we are not permitted visit the premises,” she added.
 
 It may be recalled that a public hearing conducted by the forest department a week ago to seek public opinion on the proposal to fell trees had turned chaotic with two groups gettinjg into an argument. The   high court and Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976 had made public hearing mandatory if the number trees to be felled is more than 50/ hectare. The proposal of constructing a new DC office complex requires felling of 502 big trees and 164 smaller ones. Though 189 people submitted their opinion, many felt that the hearing should be held again considering the commotion prevailed during the session.
