THANE: The Thane court acquitted a driver in a murder case of a dubbing artiste from the film industry in 2013. 

 District judge P P Jadhav, in his order, observed that the prosecution failed to prove the charges under IPC Section 302 (murder) against   (33). The prosecution told the court that the deceased,  , her husband and their son lived in an apartment in  . Singh worked as a driver in a company where Maison's husband worked. On January 2, 2013, Maison did not go to work as she was unwell.
 
 Her husband asked the driver to visit Maison. The driver later called him up, saying there was no response when he rang the doorbell and that the house was locked from inside.
 
 The complainant then rushed home and found his wife lying dead inside the house, the prosecution said.
 
 After the woman was found dead, the husband filed a complaint with the police alleging that the driver had entered the house and killed his wife.
 
 However, the defence counsel argued that the prosecution had not proved the cause of the woman's death.
 
 Judge Jadhav said even if it is was presumed that some calls were exchanged between Maison and Sonu there was no communication between them after December 31, 2012, as per the call data records.
 
 The investigating officer admitted that till January 5, 2013, Maison's husband had not raised suspicion against anyone, the judge said. agencies
