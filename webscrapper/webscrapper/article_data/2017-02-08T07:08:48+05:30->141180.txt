VADODARA: The poll battle for the two seats of donor’s category seats of   is heating up. 

 Just two days ahead of the elections, scheduled on Thursday, a group of old and newly elected senate members launched a signature campaign on Tuesday demanding a requisition meeting of the senate to discuss the inclusion of 38 names in the electoral list prepared for the donor’s category seats. 
 
 The senators alleged that the “so-called” donations were accepted by the university in the name of the Vadodara International Art and Culture Festival known as VadFest which was organised in 2015. “Just a month before the election, a letter was given to the university for considering the 38 names as donors with the letter signed on behalf of VadFest,” the letter demanding requisite meet states, adding that an open certificate signed by director and dean of   mentions that the donation was done for “spot or track lights” and other art work and renovation. 
 
 “The receipts of Rs one lakh each to the said voters was issued on November 2016 two years after the VadFest program,” the letter signed by senators allege. The senators have demanded the meet stating that as per their information “no such donation is received by the university in the form of kind” and hence the receipts issued to 38 individuals or trusts are “unlawful”. 
 
 “We are seeking clarification on what kind of donation has the university received, who evaluated this donation, whether the donation is in movable or immovable form, how it is accounted for in the books of university accounts, whether the donated items were put before any authority like syndicate body or committee for evaluation,” said senator  .
 
 The senators have also sought clarification on whether the university’s syndicate has passed any resolution with the Art and   when VadFest was organised and whether the university had made any financial commitment to VadFest. 
 
 “If yes, we want to know the procedure adopted for making payment to the supplier by the university,” said Ravat.
