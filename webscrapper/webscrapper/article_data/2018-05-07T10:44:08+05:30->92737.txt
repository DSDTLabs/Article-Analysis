BATHINDA: With a year left to the 2019 parliamentary elections, SAD president   toured villages in Bathinda on Sunday to announce that Union road transport and highways minister Nitin   would be visiting the district on May 10 to inaugurate two national highways. 

 Having lost the state assembly elections last year, this was the first time in a long time that Sukhbir mingled with voters in Bathinda. He said Gadkari would be inaugurating the Bathinda-Zirakpur and Bathinda-Amritsar highways. Even as Gadkari would be throwing them open, the two highways are already in use by commuters. On Saturday, Sukhbir’s wife, Union food-processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal inaugurated a skill centre in Bathinda and   each. 
 
 Gadkari’s arrival is being seen as the SAD-BJP alliance’s move to launch the 2019 election campaign for Harsimrat. “Sukhbir wants to use Gadkari’s visit to showcase that even though   is ruling in  , the SAD still holds sway in the state and brought a number of projects from the Centre,” said a source in the SAD. 
 
 The source added that the former deputy CM of Punjab and his wife were trying to ensure that the construction of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) begins in Bathinda soon. 
 
 ‘Heavy security for Shahkot’
 
 SAD chief Sukhbir Badal said the Election Commission should ensure heavy deployment of paramilitary forces for the May 28 bylection for Shahkot assembly seat. “We fear the ruling party would rig the polls. The Election Commission should ensure free-and-fair elections. Also, the candidature of Congress nominee   should be rejected as he has been booked for involvement in sand mining,” he said.
