MUMBAI: Civic officials are working with local communities to remove   shrines following the high court order. On Monday,   met with   of six   in Andheri-Vile Parle (E) to shift the structures from footpaths. Assistant municipal commissioner Devendra Kumar Jain will visit each site on Wednesday. “We are implementing the HC order by taking all communities into confidence,” he said. 

 Godfrey Pimenta of NGO Watchdog Foundation said, “The Gundavli Lane 3 cross is in category A so there’s no question of relocation. Also, it is reflected in the city survey plan. Crosses at Marol Gaothan, Saraswat Bank and Gaondevi Talao are also in the survey plan. We have agreed to remove the extension to Vailankanni grotto at Bamanwada.” Another contentious cross is located ‘opposite’ Holy Family Church in Chakala.
