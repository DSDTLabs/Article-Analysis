BENGALURU: Chemist shops in the city are likely to remain shut in support of a nationwide bandh on May 30 called by the   and Druggists against online sale of drugs.Drug stores at nursing homes and hospitals, both private and government, however, will remain open.

 E-portal to regulate drug sale
 
 The much-hyped proposal of setting up an e-portal to regulate sale of drugs in the country has raised questions. As per the proposed e-portal, every time a drug is sold, the seller must upload the doctor's prescription, his MCI registration number, number of doses, name of the drug, batch number along with the patient's name. Chemists say uploading the data online every time will be a difficult task, besides it can also compromise patients' privacy .
 
 “Chemists have to electronically uploaded doctor prescriptions furnished by drug buyers within a stipulated time period on the e-portal. Lack of proper infrastructure including internet and access to computer, besides poor power supply in rural areas makes it impractical for a chemist to upload prescriptions on the e-portal. The government has to first provide facilities and proper training before coming up with such schemes. The proposal poses risk to the livelihood of  's 28,000 chemists,“ said  , president,   and Druggists Association.
 
 When asked, senior drugs control department officials said there was no clarity on the e-portal yet.
 
 “As of now it's a proposal and the state government hasn't received any standing instructions with regard to it.As per what we know, a patient's details have to be uploaded on the portal. It's a breach of patients' privacy .Questions have also been raised about who all can access the data from the portal,“ said a senior officer.
