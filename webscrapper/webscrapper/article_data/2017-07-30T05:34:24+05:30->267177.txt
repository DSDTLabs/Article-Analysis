NAVI MUMBAI: Following the   building tragedy, the   (UMC) has issued   notices to occupants of as many as 90 rickety buildings which have been declared unsafe. 

 But residents of these buildings have refused to budge, stating that no alternative arrangements are being provided by the administration . 
 
 All the 90 buildings declared dangerous for further occupation by the civic body continue to be inhabited, said UMC sources. The families are staying in these structures seem unmindful of the perils which could claim precious lives in case of any contingency. 
 
 UMC had earlier identified these structures as dangerous to stay but could not vacate them over the years. Officials say they have been working on a frenetic space with the advent of rains and blame the residents for not vacating the structures. 
 
 They are refusing to budge despite the danger looming large, said sources adding that the administration will not be held responsible for any misadventure. Every passing year the administration has been slapping eviction notices but in vain, said UMC officials. 
 
 Also, in the absence of either transit homes or alternative arrangements, the occupants prefer to stay put in the unsafe structures. 
 
 “There is no administrative provision of rehabilitation for the families living in these buildings which is why residents are not ready to move out from their homes,” said  , UMC chairperson.
