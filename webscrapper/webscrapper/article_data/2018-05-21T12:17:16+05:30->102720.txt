GAYA: Chakand police station SHO   Kumar who was arrested on Saturday on charges of setting free two liquor smugglers –   and his son Dheeraj Sah – after accepting Rs 1.16 lakh from them, escaped from custody on Saturday night. Gaya   Rajiv Mishra said a man hunt has been launched to nab him.

 Police sources added that a former sarpanch of Rasoolpur panchayat allegedly brokered the deal between the SHO and the liquor traders. On receiving a compliant regarding the SHO’s move, the SSP reached the police station and inquired into the charges against the SHO and found them to be true. Soon a search operation was conducted and the police team recovered Rs 1.16 lakh paid to the SHO by smugglers from his retiring room on the police station premises. Following the recovery, Pawan was immediately arrested and brought to Gaya and was remanded to judicial custody. He was kept in the office of the DSP (law and order).
 
 “A case has been filed. Responsibility will be fixed and cops found negligent or conniving with the SHO would be punished,” said Mishra.
