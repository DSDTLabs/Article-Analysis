PANCHKULA: In what appears to be an attempt to break ice between the bureaucrats and Panchkula mayor, municipal commissioner   on Friday walked up to mayor   after formally taking over his office. 

 According to sources, the mayor and the MC chief held a meeting for nearly 30 minutes wherein they discussed about the civic body issues needed to be taken up. 
 
 It has been alleged that it was an ego issue between the mayor and the municipal commissioners that had led to the mess in the civic body, bringing the   to a stand still. 
 
 "It was a fruitful meeting. The commissioner has given his vision and we had taken up the issues to be done on priority basis. Now the works will begin," said Walia.
 
 Echoing similar sentiments, Meena said, "The development works and those related to the Right to Service tops our priority list. We had a discussion on other pending issues as well." 
 
 Meena had replaced Dr Shaleen, who had been shifted following a spat with the mayor in a meeting. Shaleen's term lasted for 50 days and his posting was consequent to the transfer of  , who, too, had a war of words with Walia and had to face the wrath of Punjab and Haryana high court about two months ago.
 
 Consequently, he had to volunteer for a transfer. Siwach was first such officer, who along with others, had staged a walkout during a house meeting of the MC after the mayor had an argument with him over the status of development works.
 
 "We are elected representatives and had pressure from our fellow colleagues. We never had our personal agendas, hence, we had to take those issue with the officials,'' he added. While Meena outrightly expressed his inability to comment on the past incidents. "We are here to work for the masses. Lot of things have to be done and it is a team work,'' he said.
