DEHRADUN: There is a strong belief in political circles in   that the party winning the Gangotri constituency - in the region where river Ganga has its source - goes on to form the government in the state. In 2002,   candidate Vijay Pal   won the seat (his party formed the government); in 2007, Gopal   of BJP clinched Gangotri and, subsequently, the saffron party came to power.

 In 2012, the seat was again won by   and Congress came to power that year.
 
 Ask locals and they are quick to attribute it to "the ashirwad (blessings) of Ma Ganga". "Unless the goddess gives her go-ahead, no party can hope to come to power in the state," claims Rajnikant Semwal, priest at the Gangotri dham temple.
 
 Perhaps it is this belief that has prompted both BJP and Congress to not take any chances and field their tried and tested warhorses in battle this time too.
 
 While BJP has again placed its bet on Gopal Rawat, Congress has fielded sitting MLA Sajwan.
 
 Political observers say Rawat has the BJP state machinery behind him while Sajwan has mass appeal and is popular among the over 80,000 voters in the constituency .
