Iranian director Asghar   bagged the Oscar for the Best Foreign Language Film for his much-acclaimed film ‘The Salesman’. As the celebrated filmmaker had promised, he gave the prestigious awards ceremony a miss as a mark of protest against US President Donald Trump’s visa ban for citizens from   and several other countries.

 
 A statement was read out by   on behalf of Farhadi as part of his acceptance speech. In the statement, Farhadi expressed his disappointment over the ban on entry of immigrants in the US. 
  
 The statement read, “I am sorry I am not with you tonight. My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the US. Dividing the world into the Us and enemy categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights…Filmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions.” The speech was met with a thunderous round of applause.
