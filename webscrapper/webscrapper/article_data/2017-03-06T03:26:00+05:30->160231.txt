Panaji: With the introduction of negative marking and computer-based recruitment test (CBRT) for selection of junior scale officers, only five out of 1,056 candidates cleared the test conducted by Goa Public Service Commission (GPSC).  GPSC chairman Jose Manuel Noronha on Sunday told TOI that they had received 1,856 applications for 11 posts of junior scale officer, out of which 1,506 appeared for the exam. “But, only five passed the exam,” Noronha said. He informed that these five candidates have to now appear for a written test and interview before they are recruited.  Once the junior scale officer is recruited and trained, he or she would join as a deputy collector, director, member secretary or deputy director in one of the government departments. Earlier, there was a direct written test, and those who cleared the test, were called for an interview. With the introduction of CBRT, the council hopes to eliminate any allegations of bias, such as elimination of deserving candidates due to strict corrections, while average candidates score high marks. CBRT has created a level playing field and screens candidates in the first round to ensure that only the best candidates make it to the written test. General category candidates have to score 65% to clear the CBRT, OBCs need 60% score and STs need to achieve 55%.  The commission have tested candidates on general issues, including environmental ecology, bio-diversity, climate change, pollution and its effects, forest conservation, etc. Similarly, questions had been framed on science, technology and innovation: startups, seed-funding, venture capital, angel funding, aims and objectives of national innovation council and various government authorities dealing with innovation.
