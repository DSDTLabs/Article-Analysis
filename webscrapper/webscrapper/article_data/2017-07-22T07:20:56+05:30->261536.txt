HYDERABAD: The district consumer forum here has directed a play school to pay `5 lakh as compensation to parents of a toddler, who lost his life because of the institute's negligence.

 The petitioner,   P admitted his one-andhalf year-old son   to Abhigna Play School cum Baby Care Centre. According to Anil, his son had fallen into a sump on the school premises at about 3pm on August 13, 2014. The school conveyed the tragic news to his wife and shifted the boy immediately to a private hospital at L B Nagar.
 
 Anil said that soon after reaching the hospital, he fo und out that his son died. Subsequently, he lodged a complaint with   police about the death of his son due to 'negligence' of the day care centre. The police visited the school and registered a case under section 304-A against the management.
 
 “The centre is expected to take all the necessary precautions for the safety of the children. But the cover of the water sump, which was clo se to the paly area, was re moved and it was due to the sheer negligence on the part of the centre that my son fell into it,“ said   before the forum.
 
 The school management, on the other hand, chose to ignore the forum notice.
 
 During the trial, the bench said, “As rightly con tended by the child's father, the opposite party should have taken all precautions to safeguard the children. The boy fell into the water sump because the cover was not in place. This amounts to 'gross negligence' on the part of the school authorities.“
 
 “The complainant and his family must have suffered a lot due to mental agony as they lost their son at a tender age. Therefore, we find `deficiency in service' on the part of school management,“ the bench added. Taking this into consideration, the principal of the play school was directed to pay `5 lakh as compensation to the parents and an additional Rs 5,000 towards legal costs. The deadline for the school to comply with the order is 30 days.
