CHANDRAPUR: A tiger killed a woman who was out in the forest to collect tendu leaves in   range on Friday morning. 

 The victim, Shrisagari Thakre, resident of   village, was attacked by the tiger and dragged deep into the forest even before other labourers could rush to her rescue. By the time they could track the woman, the tiger had killed her and fled the spot. South Brahmapuri range forest officer (RFO) GR Naighamkar claimed that the incident took place in compartment no. 233 of the range.
 
 A team led by Naighamkar removed the dead body for post-mortem and paid Rs50,000 ex gratia to the kin of the deceased. ACF Shankar Pandhre also visited the spot. 
 
 This is the third such incident in the last six days. A bear had killed three tendu leaves collectors and mauled three other labourers last Saturday. A leopard had mauled five villagers in   village in   range on Thursday. 
 
 This is 13th human kill in wildlife attacks in the district this year. Tiger have claimed 10 lives out of these victims.
