PANAJI: Goa police have recommended to the government to “avoid” screening of “Padmavat” during peak tourist season due to its personnel being engaged in security arrangements.

 “As per intelligence inputs, no major law and order situation is expected to arise in the state of Goa. However, the ongoing season being of great tourist rush and police forces being engaged in arrangements… we should avoid giving opportunity to people to agitate at this stage,” said the letter addressed to the secretary to the CM.
 
 CM   said the government has not taken any call on the recommendation. “We are yet to take a decision,” he told TOI. Goa police’s recommendation came after BJP Mahila Morcha and three other outfits petitioned the state that the film release “is likely to hurt the sentiments of a large section of society”.
 
 The Goa police's letter refers to the movie with its original title “Padmavati” and not “Padmavat”, the name in which it would be released on January 25. Meanwhile, police conducted inquiries through district superintendents of police (SPs) and special branch centres and said as per the report of SP (north), no activities against the screening of the film have been conducted so far.
 
 Also, managements of theatres in the district have decided not to screen the film. But police said since the petitioners are members of the BJP Mahila Morcha, “the possibility of a law and order situation cannot be ruled out” being a matter of “great sentimental value”. A similar report was received from the South Goa SP.
 
 “No complaints/representations have been received at the police stations in south Goa district filing objection against the screening of the film, and there are no reports indicating the possibility of adverse law and order situations in south Goa district,” Goa police said.
