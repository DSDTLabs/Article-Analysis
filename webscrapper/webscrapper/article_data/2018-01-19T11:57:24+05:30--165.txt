MARGAO: Former tourism minister Francisco Xavier ‘Mickky’ Pacheco on Thursday questioned the need for mid-term elections to the state legislative assembly polls and said the present coalition government should be allowed to complete its full term.

 Pacheco was referring to the recent statement made by urban development minister Francis D’Souza, who said the possibility of mid-term polls was not ruled out.
 
 The former minister also flayed   minister Vijai   for his recent decision to name the area from the Colva circle to Ravindra Bhavan, Margao, the Opinion Poll Square and demanded that a statue of   be installed at the circle. He also questioned the unprecedented hype over Opinion Poll events.
 
 Stating the Sardesai should urge chief minister   to drop the MGP from his cabinet for opposing the installation of Jack Sequeira’s statue in the assembly complex, Pacheco said it was not surprising that PWD minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar was against the initiative as the MGP had rallied for Goa’s merger with Maharashtra.
