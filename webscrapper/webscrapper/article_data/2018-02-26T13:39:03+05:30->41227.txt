VIJAYAWADA: Vanga   (27) who slipped into   after a botched C-section at   government general hospital lost her battle for life after a week. She died on Sunday afternoon while undergoing treatment. The relatives of Chittemma staged a protest in front of Vijayawada government hospital with the dead body, demanding for justice. 

 Meanwhile, the committee constituted by the Director of   (DME) M Subbarao to probe into allegations of doctor’s negligence gave a clean-chit to the doctors. Speaking to TOI, Subbarao said that there has been a delay in reaching the hospital and her condition was critical by the time she reached hospital. She developed nephrosis with excessive bleeding.
 
 The RDO Gudivada visited Vijayawada GGH and promised the grieving family that the government would extend all the support. Vijayawada south ACP K Srinivas said that they have registered a case and forwarded the same to   police as the death too place in Guntur.
 
 Chittemma, a   labourer, was admitted to Vijayawada GGH on February 18. Doctors at Vijayawada GGH performed a C-section and she gave birth to a baby girl on the next day. Later, during the day Chittemma complained of stomach pain and on examining her, doctors found that she was hemorrhaging internally. They decided to conduct an hysterectomy on her. Chittemma’s condition further deteriorated when her kidneys were damaged when the urine output stopped. Doctors then referred her to Guntur GGH as they did not have facilities for dialysis. But by the time she reached Guntur, she slipped into a coma.
