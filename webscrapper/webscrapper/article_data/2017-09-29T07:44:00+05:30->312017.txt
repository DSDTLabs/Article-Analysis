Jalandhar: US-based Sikh groups — Eco Sikh and Sikh Sewak Society — have announced to launch Gurudwara Organic Movement, which would promote organic langar in gurdwaras.

 They have said that Akal Takht and Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) should urge all gurudwaras to ensure that langar is prepared with only organic produce.
 
 “While we appreciate the SGPC for starting the project in Amritsar, the need of the hour is to give the concept a major push. With this, not only the people would get healthy food, but also the farmers would get benefitted. It would be the beginning of an economically and ecologically sustainable model of agriculture,” said US-based Dr Rajwant Singh, who heads the Eco Sikh.
 
 He said that they were working with some gurudwaras and farmers to start the model.
 
 “If gurdwaras start this for the langar where lakhs of people have food daily, then it can set a model for all. When Punjab is staring at serious ecological and health problems because of poisoned soil, shifting to organic farmers can be the solution,” said Parminder Pal Singh of Sikh Sewak Society.
 
 “At the time when all types of resources of the state have already been exhausted, this model can play a vital role,” Parminder added.
 
 The Sikh groups also demanded that non-biodegradable disposable crockery should be banned.
