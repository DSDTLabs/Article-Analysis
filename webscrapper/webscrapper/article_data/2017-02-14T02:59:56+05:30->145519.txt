Gurgaon: A 15-year-old girl was in for a shock when she found that an unknown person had used her name to create a fake account on Snapchat, and was circulating explicit photographs and messages on the   platform. The matter came to light after the accused started referring her friends in his   messages, prompting the girl’s father to seek police help. 

 In his complaint filed at DLF Phase 2 police station, the girl’s father, a senior executive with a private firm, said the accused used the fake account to upload explicit messages, both in words and pictures, causing immense mental pain and trauma to his daughter. According to him, his daughter first came to know about the wrongdoings when her friends, mostly girls, told her that “someone had created a fake account in her name with malafide intentions and was contacting them via Snapchat”.
 
 A multimedia mobile application, Snapchat is used to communicate with people using images and videos which are usually short-lived and self-deleting. The girl initially thought it was a prank and informed her father. She also requested the “unknown person” to stop using her name for circulating images, but in vain. More messages followed.
 
 Inspector Sudeep, additional SHO at DLF Phase 2 police station, said that the investigation to trace the person was underway. “We have issued a notice to Snapchat, and are waiting for a response. They will have to provide us with the IP address, from which the fake account was created. Only then the investigation can proceed,” he said.
 
 Inspector Anand of the cybercrime cell, which is assisting cops at the DLF Phase 2 police station with technical knowhow, said: “We are awaiting a reply from Snapchat. It is not clear yet if the accused is in India or abroad,” he said. However, the girl’s father suspects that it can be a handiwork of a known person.
