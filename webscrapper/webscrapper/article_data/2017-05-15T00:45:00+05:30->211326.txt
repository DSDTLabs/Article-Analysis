Bhopal: After 12 students committed suicide within hours of the announcement of MP Board-conducted Class 10 and 12 MP examination, Madhya Pradesh school   Vijay Shah Sunday blamed parents, accusing them of constantly harping before kids to do well in exams.

 The minister said the school education department has taken all major steps to curb the menace of suicide by students by introducing Ruk Jana Nahi scheme. However, recent incidents suggest that parents are answerable for it.
 
 “We did our best to control incidents of suicide. Despite that students are killing themselves, which is worrisome. We introduced Ruk Jana Nahi a year ago, but there is no change in the trend. We also made it mandatory for all schools to have at least one counsellor appointed, but unfortunately there is no change in suicide. It means something is very annoying and wrong with parents,” Shah said.
 
 Asked if more steps are being taken in this regard, he said parent-teacher meetings are made compulsory in schools in which all parents must participate after every two months. The minister said a number of advertisements for Ruk Jana Nahi scheme were published for awareness among students in local media organisations a week ahead of results.
 
 “The children always live under pressure to meet parents’ expectations. They are either told to secure more than 90% or become a doctor, engineer. It is parents, who push their kids to extreme limits,” Shah stressed. He was replying to queries about a spike in   shortly after after results of Class 10 and 12 were announced.
 
 “This is why we give students another chance in a year so that they do not lose one precious year. These students are also being coached through open school for at least a month after failing so that they are prepared for next exam,” he told TOI.
 
 Experts, however, believe parents alone are not to be blamed. They say improvement in teaching quality, re-visiting educational policies, school timings, teachers support can help children cope better with disappointments, exams and life.
 
 Parenting to blame?
 
 City-based psychiatrist Dr Satyakant Trivedi while speaking to TOI said 12 suicides in 12 hours has sparked a huge debate. “Parents are not to be blamed alone. It comes down to three clear factors: one, schools have stopped giving moral science lessons to students, which is need of an hour. Religion plays a pivotal role to curb such menace but people don’t realise it. Secondly, the norms have drastically changed, a child who earlier used to go to school between 10- 4 was apparently happy compared to those, who go to school between 6-2. Lastly, an intense pressure to perform well that we witness nowadays, builds turmoil like none other. For this, schools and parents are equally responsible,” he said. Dr Trivedi has made some observations for rise in number of suicides
 
 • Inferiority complex created by giving hype to toppers
 
 • Over-importance to Class 10, 12 results
 
 • Disappointment a breeding ground for depression and suicide
 
 • Coping deficit among students
 
 • Cognition for shame
 
 • Nuclear families
 
 • Lack of mental health education in school curriculum
 
 • Lack of improvement in teaching quality
