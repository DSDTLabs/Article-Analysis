PATNA: An incident of utter neglect by family members came to light when the body of an  , which had been left abandoned for two days, was recovered from her house in Kadamkuan locality of the city on Thursday.

 Nili Sarkar (60), wife of Dr A K Sarkar, HoD of pathology department at Government Ayurvedic College, passed away on Tuesday, but no one from the family reached there for last rites until police intervened. The elderly woman had been living alone for some time and was being taken care of by a maid because of ill health.
 
 On Tuesday evening, the maid found the woman’s body and informed the neighbours about her demise. The neighbours, who contacted her family members, said neither Dr Sarkar nor the woman’s daughter, who lives in Delhi, showed interest. “We then brought the matter to the notice of Kadamkuan police,” said one of Nili’s neighbours. 
 
 City SP (central) D Amarkesh said initially the relatives of the woman were unwilling to even visit the place and perform the last rites. “The woman had been living alone for quite some time. Her husband, according to our information, has married another woman. We have contacted her daughter. After initial reluctance, she has agreed to come to the city to perform the last rites of her mother,” he said.
 
 Inspector of Kadamkuan police station Ajay Kumar said police tried to contact Dr Sarkar several times, but to no avail. “We then contacted the superintendent of the Ayurvedic College, who said the doctor was on leave till January 11,” the SHO said, adding it’s not yet clear whether Dr Sarkar had divorced Nili or not.
