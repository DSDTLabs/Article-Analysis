JAIPUR: Bravery of two male nurses in Sawai Man Singh (SMS) hospital helped police arrest an accused involved in selling of blood to needy patient on Sunday.

 The two nurses —   and Sateyendra Chaudhary are posted in south wing-II of the SMS hospital. “They showed presence of mind and gripped the accused who had come to sell blood to a needy patient,” SMS hospital’s additional superintendent   said.
 
 Randheer Singh, investigating officer,  , said, “The arrested accused Rajkumar is a private ambulance driver. One Ramvatar filed an FIR that a man had charged him Rs 3,000 for per unit of blood to him. His cousin brother is undergoing treatment in the hospital for cancer.”
 
 A patient, who belonged to Agra in Uttar Pradesh, is undergoing treatment in the hospital for blood cancer. For his treatment, his attendant has to arrange blood frequently.
 
 Since the patient belonged to UP, he did not have any idea about the treatment and the rates. And as far as blood is concerned, the hospital provides blood to attendants in exchange of blood. A patient has to donate blood to get blood from the blood bank in the SMS hospital. 
 
 As the patient required blood regularly, he got in touch with an agent, who sold blood in the hospital. He purchased blood 13 times. Each time, the agent charged him Rs 3,000. The patient has paid about Rs 40,000 to him so far. 
 
 The attendant shared with the nurses in the ward that he had no more money to buy blood. That is when the nurses asked him why was he buying blood and learnt of the entire story of the man who engaged in selling blood to patients within the hospital. The nurses informed him that the blood is available in the hospital free of cost. 
 
 The nurses then asked him to call the person immediately outside the south wing-II. When the accused came to sell the blood, the two nurses immediately caught him and handed him over to the agent.
