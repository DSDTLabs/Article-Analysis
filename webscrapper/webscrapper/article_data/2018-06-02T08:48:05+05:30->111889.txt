AHMEDABAD: Natural gas consumers will now have to pay more as   (AGL) has increased prices of compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas (PNG) in Ahmedabad and Vadodara. The city gas distribution company revised prices across all categories — residential, commercial and industrial — with effect from June 1, 2018.

 According to the new rates on AGL’s website, the CNG price has been increased by Rs 1.30 per kg to Rs 51 per kg (inclusive of tax) from Rs 49.70 per kg, while prices of PNG for residential consumers has been raised by Rs 23.57 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu) to Rs 630.29 per mmBtu from Rs 606.72 per mmBtu (exclusive of tax).
 
 The company last increased CNG and PNG (domestic) prices in the second half of April. However, it had then not revised PNG prices for commercial and industrial consumers.
 
 This time, the company also hiked PNG prices for commercial and industrial consumers. PNG prices for commercial users have been increased to Rs 1,240.70 per mmBtu and for industrial consumers with a minimum guaranteed offtake (MGO), the price has increased to Rs 929.60 per mmBtu. These rates are exclusive of taxes.
 
 AGL serves about 2,85,000 households and approximately 1,50,000 CNG users in Ahmedabad and Vadodara.
 
 As natural gas purchases are dollar denominated, the rupee’s depreciation against the dollar has led to a rise in the purchase cost of natural gas, industry players say. Other city gas distribution companies like   (GGL) may also follow suit.   (IGL), on Monday increased CNG prices in Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad regions.
