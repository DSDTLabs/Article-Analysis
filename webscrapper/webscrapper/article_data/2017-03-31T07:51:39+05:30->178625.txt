 Even Cuttack-Choudwar MLA Pravat Biswal made efforts to convince the agitators to withdraw the ceasework but to no avail. He visited SCB in the morning hours and held talks with the junior doctors. Due to the ceasework of junior doctors, sufferings of patients are also rising. The serpentine queues at the out-patient departments (OPDs) speak volumes about the plight of patients. "The OPDs are mainly managed by the junior doctors and in their absence its really difficult for patients. I have been waiting for three hours and I am yet to meet the doctor," said  , a patient's attendant. 
 
 However, SCB authorities have claimed that things are completely under control. Emergency services are not affected at all. "We have diverted our non-clinical doctors to the wards. The senior doctors are managing the situation efficiently," said principal of SCB Dr Siddartha Das.
 
 "Talks are on and we are hopeful that the issue will be resolved soon," added Das.
