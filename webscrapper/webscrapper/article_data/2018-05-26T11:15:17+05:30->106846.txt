HYDERABAD: City doctors recommend that diabetics fasting during   take the pre-dawn meal at Sahr as late as possible to avoid severe fluctuations in blood sugar levels. They also recommend intake of high fibre foods and consumption of sugar-free beverages and large quantities of water at Sahr and after breaking of fast at Iftar.

 
 Dr  , senior consultant diabetologist,  , and Dr Ravi Muppidi, senior endocrinologist,  , said fasting diabetics, particularly those on insulin, should monitor blood sugar levels several times a day. Inclusion of fruits and vegetables at Sahr and Iftar would make fasting easier for diabetics.
 
  
 “Do not ignore warning signs of low/high blood sugar. It is advisable not to continue fasting if blood sugar level goes below 70 mg/dL or if it goes above 300 mg/dL,” they said recommending that diabetics limit intake of fried food, sweets, and caffeinated drinks.
 
 “They should not undertake physical exercise while fasting. Consult doctors if you are on regular medication for any ailment,” Dr Khan said, adding that potential health hazards include dehydration and acute metabolic complications like diabetic ketoacidosis.
 
 “Rigorous exercise is not recommended during fasting because of the increased risk of hypoglycaemia and/or dehydration. But diabetics are encouraged to take regular light-to-moderate exercise. Physical exertions involved in Tarawih (late night) prayers, such as bowing, kneeling and rising, should be considered part of their daily exercise,” Dr Ravi said.
