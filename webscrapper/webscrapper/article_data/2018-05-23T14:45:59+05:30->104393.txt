NAGPUR: The   campaign for the   byelection looked a bit laboured with party veteran   braving it in the scorching heat to carry on the burden. Now, with barely five more days of public campaigning left, NCP is deploying its senior-most leaders to give it a big boost.

 On Tuesday, Dhananjay Munde, leader of the Opposition in state legislative council and one of the best orators of the parry addressed two poll rallies for party candidate Madhukar Kukde. Ajit Pawar, former deputy CM, is to get into the act there on Wednesday while on Friday it will be turn of newly-appointed state president of the party  . The public campaigning ends on Saturday, a day before the polling date of May 28.
 
 Last Sunday which was the only public holiday was wasted by the party as Patel had to rush to Mumbai for the some urgent meetings. In contrast, the weekend was utilized for high-octane campaign by the BJP for its candidate Hemant Patle, who is giving a tough fight to the NCP-Congress. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis addressed couple of rallies on Saturday, Union minister Nitin Gadkari drew a large crowd at his rally.
 
 As the poll drive heated up, the ruling BJP with its better resources and Fadnavis taking up the responsibility did manage to get an edge in the campaign. However, the caste factor could be deciding. NCPâ€™s Kukde is from the Kunbi community which as around 27% vote. Patel of BJP belongs to Powar community that has second largest vote chunk of 25%. In such a close tussle, the Teli vote of around 20% and SC-ST, Kohali and others who make up the remaining 28% could sway the final tally of the winner. Telis normally go with the BJP and with no RPI or BSP candidate in the fray, the Dalit vote may help the NCP this time.
 
 Meanwhile, an independent candidate Kishor Panchabhai of Azad Shetkari Sanghatana, has bowed out of the poll race expressing support to BJP candidate. He told reporters here that he would garner votes for Patel in Paoni area.
