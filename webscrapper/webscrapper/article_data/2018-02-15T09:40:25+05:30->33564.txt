NEW DELHI: The equity markets on Thursday morning opened with benchmark indices gaining half a per cent each even as analysts opined that the Rs 11,500 crore fraud in Punjab National Bank ( ) will keep the Street under pressure.

 30-share BSE   opened with a modest gain of 51.48 points before extending its gains to more than 100 points within the initial 10 minutes of trading.   too, opened with a jump of 37 points and held on to the gains in the morning.
 
 The PNB fraud though is still having its bearing on the bank's stock as on BSE it was trading 8 per cent below previous closing at 9.30 am. The scrip had lost 10 per cent on Wednesday. The allegation and probe on leading jewellery companies is also taking its toll as  , one of the jewellery maker which came under the scanner was losing 12 per cent in early trading. Other scrips in the sector like PC Jeweller, Rajesh Exports, Asian Star, Tribhovandas etc were all in the red.
 
 However, in the broader market, all sectoral sub-indices were in the green even as none of them were outperforming. PSU Bank sub-index, which lost almost 3 per cent on Wednesday was trading flat.
