SHIVPURI (Madhya Pradesh): Union Minister   has remarked that there was a major difference between Prime Minister Narendra   and the leaders of the   party, citing a rather atypical example - the hair of the moustache and that of the tail.

 
  [There is no comparison between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and  . They are as different as the hair of moustache and hair of tail.]," Tomar said, while addressing a gathering of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers in Kolaras of Madhya Pradesh, on December 30.
 
 The minister further said that Congress leaders would take a long time to become like Prime Minister Modi, adding Congress had collapsed in the country and had been heading towards a decline since 2014.
 
 This remark has added to the ever-growing list of innuendos exchanged between the two national parties.
