NAVI MUMBAI: Following the report by TOI on   along  , the authorities swung into action to fix them despite a heavy downpour on Friday. 

 A JCB machine has been brought in to fill the craters developed along the asphalt stretches. The work is being carried out during non-peak hours to avoid snarls, said officials.
 
 Motorists were inconvenienced due to potholes at Digha, Bharat Bijlee junction near Airoli station, Talvali Naka, Ghansoli, Mahape and Savita Chemical junction. While paver blocks are being fixed at some patches, grit and boulders are being used in others. Motorists, however, are unhappy over the temporary patch work, which they believe will get washed away after a spell of heavy rain.
 
 “Proper repairing work should have been done as part of the pre-monsoon work. It is the civic body’s task to station machines and manpower at to attend to potholes quickly, but not after the apathy is reported in the media,” said Tej Chand, a motorist.
 
 Sharad Kale, deputy engineer of the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), who is looking after the Thane-Belapur Road maintenance, said, “The patch work is going on in full swing with additional deployment of men and machinery. We will complete the work in the next two days as the work is getting delayed due to incessant rain and increasing density of traffic.”
