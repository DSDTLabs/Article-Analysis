 The 58-year-old star, who is returning to the silver screen with ' ', said in Yerawada Central prison he always used to think about his comeback movie and the Omung Kumar-directed film was the perfect story. "I missed myself on the big screen all the time. When I was in jail, I used to think whenever I will come out, I will start doing films again and 'Bhoomi' was the right script. It is a great film to make a comeback with,"   said.
 
 The film is a revenge drama that revolves around a father-daughter relationship. Actor   is playing the role of Dutt's daughter in the movie. Dutt said his on screen character 'Arun Sachdeva' is completely different from his real self. 
 
 "In this film, I have not acted like the father I am in real life. There is a huge differnce between my character Arun Sachdeva and the real Sanjay Dutt as father. Father is a father anyway. But I didn't relate my relationship with my kids to my relationship with my onscreen daughter," he said. 
 
 Produced by Omung, Sandeep Singh and Bhushan Kumar, 'Bhoomi' is set to release on September 22.
