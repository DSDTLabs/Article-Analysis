JAIPUR: Despite a series of initiatives by the Centre as well as by the state government, the number of children (under-5 years) suffering from severe acute   ( ) has not decreased in the state. Instead, the number of such kids has increased significantly.

 According to NFHS-4 survey released recently, the percentage of children (under-5) with SAM is 8.6%. Health experts, helping government in combating malnutrition, claimed that based on NFHS-4 survey, if calculation is done, the number of SAM children must be more than 7.63 lakh in the state. The experts claimed that they were around 6.5 lakh in number if calculation is done on the basis of NFH-3 survey conducted 10 years ago, which shows that percentage of SAM children in the state was 7.3%.
 
 The two surveys conducted in a gap of 10 years shows that SAM children have increased in numbers from 6.5 lakhs to 7.63 lakhs in the state.
 
 However, state's health authorities questioned the methodology of the NFHS-4 claiming that percentage of SAM children should not be more than 5% in the state.National health mission (state) mission director   said, “I question the methodology of NFHS. We have conducted a survey of 2.34lakh children in 41 blocks of 13 districts including 10 High Priority Districts and 3 Tribal Districts of the state. We found 11,000 children with SAM. So, the SAM children were around 4.7% out of total population of children. The 13 districts are worst affected districts of the state in terms of malnutrition. The other districts of the state are far better in comparison to 13 districts we surveyed. So, I think that in entire state, it must be well below that 5%.“
