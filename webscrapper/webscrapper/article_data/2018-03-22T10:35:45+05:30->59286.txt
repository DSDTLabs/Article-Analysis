KOCHI: #FUTURE -- the twoday digital summit of the state government beginning here on Thursday – is expected to give its 1,400 delegates a fully digital experience, with its organisers looking to manage delegate enquires and panel interaction with artificial intelligence.

 Over 900 delegates have already downloaded the   application being used for the purpose. An artificial intelligence bot will provide the basic information on programmes and speakers in the ‘general discussion’ chat room while the other ‘rooms’ cater to each discussion panel.
 
 “A message that #FUTURE intends to give to people is that almost 60% jobs will soon be automated with technologies like artificial intelligence,” said V K Mathews, member of high-power IT committee.
 
 
 
 
 Microsoft   is only one of these AIbased products that take the consumer directly to the producer. This can lead to creation of millions of new jobs and #FUTURE intends to aid the state to capitalize on the opportunity,” said Mathews.
 
 An SMS has been sent to all registered participants with the download link to the application. The mobile number of the user is identified once the application is downloaded and he/she is added to the chat rooms. Participants can shoot their questions in these chat rooms and the moderator will present them at the discussion.
 
 “We need not pass around the microphone like at any other panel discussion. We can also avoid those normal glitches like microphone not working or the speaker not audible,” secretary (electronics and information technology) M   said.
 
  director   said they wanted to modernize their interaction in tune with the theme of the event. “That is when we decided to use Microsoft Kaizala for the purpose and Microsoft set up this facility for free on their application,” he said.
 
 Kaizala is a mobile-only product designed and launched by Microsoft India in 2017 for large group communications and work management for organizations.
