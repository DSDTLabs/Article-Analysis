AHMEDABAD: A   court hearing the 2004 Ishrat   encounter case on Tuesday ordered that the passport of former DGP P P   be handed over to him for two months following certain conditions and on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 1lakh.

 Pandey had asked for his passport to go abroad temporarily. He has been discharged from the case by the CBI court on February 21.
 
 CBI judge   allowed Pandeyâ€™s request for the passport on condition that he will have to keep the registry informed about his whereabouts during his stay abroad. Upon his return to India, he will have to surrender the passport to the court registry.
 
 Pandey was indicted in this case on charges of criminal conspiracy, murder, illegal detention and abduction, when CBI filed a chargesheet against seven Gujarat police officials in 2013. While six police officials were arrested in this case, Pandey evaded arrest until the   declined to grant him anticipatory bail. He had surrendered before the court in a dramatic fashion claiming that he was suffering from UTI and he was brought in the courtroom in a stretcher.
 
 After he was released on bail, the state government courted controversy by appointing him as incharge DGP. He was even granted an extension in service. When the issue reached the Supreme Court, Pandey resigned.
