 He said that for the film's certification, the CBFC co-opted Professor Waqar Ali Shah, Chairman, Department of History, Quaid-e-Azam University as per rules.

 In India, the film's makers have had a long struggle in getting it to theatres as some Rajput outfits have been up against its release over alleged historical innaccuracies.
 
  activists have been staging violent protests across some parts of the country to stop the film's release.
 
 Originally titled 'Padmavati', the movie's makers were asked to make five modifications -- including title change, addition of two disclaimers, and some alterations in a song -- before it got a U/A certificate.
 
 With   as brave Rani Padmavati,   as menacing Alauddin Khilji and   as the proud king Maharawal Ratan Singh, the movie sets out to tell a tale of Rajput valour and sacrifice.
 
 The film, replete with Bhansali's trademark grandeur, is based on the 16th century poet  's famed poem 'Padmavat'.
