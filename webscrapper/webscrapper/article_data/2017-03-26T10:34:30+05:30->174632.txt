  “The UMC team was pushed and attempts were made to obstruct it from taking action against illegal shops. A written complaint was submitted to the police,” said UMC additional commissioner Vishal Chouhan.
 
 “We protested against manhandling done by policemen. We approached the police with same motive and registered protest against them. We didn’t protest against the UMC’s actions,” said Gandhi.
