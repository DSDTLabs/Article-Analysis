MUMBAI: Bollywood actor   was issued an e-challan by   on Wednesday for riding a two-wheeler without a helmet.   is the second actor who has been reprimanded on Twitter for a traffic violation. Varun Dhavan had been challaned when he bent out of his car window to oblige a female fan with a selfie at a traffic signal last November. 

 Twitter user Anil Kashyap had tweeted three pictures of Kemmu on a bike without a helmet, tagging the police. Acknowledging his post,   posted a photo of the challan sent to Kemmu. The challan said the offence was committed around 10.56am on Wednesday and the fine to be paid was Rs500. "I have seen this picture out there and honestly it's very embarrassing given I love bikes and ride regularly and always with a helmet and some more gear but whether it's a long ride or just next door a helmet should always be worn. apologies I don't want to set the wrong example!," tweeted Kemmu in response. 
 
 "You love bikes, we love every citizen's safety. And we wish a regret could avert mishaps! Hope next time the realisation won't be an afterthought! An e-challan has been dispatched," Mumbai Police replied. "Agreed and accepted," the actor wrote. tnn
