KOLKATA: The successful trial run of bike taxis in   over the last one and a half months has prompted the   plan extension of the service to Sector V.

 The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) recently held a review meeting with the two agencies presently operating 22 bike taxis in New Town to discuss the possibilities. It was found out that the demand for bike taxis are increasing day by day. Over 1,400 rides have been booked in the last one month or so after the initial trial period run for a forthnight. 
 
 NKDA has already written to the transport department for permission to extend the service to Sector V. “We shall consider the proposal,” said transport secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay.
 
 According to NKDA officials, the operators wants the jurisdiction of their operation extended to the surrounding areas. It was on March 16 this year that transport minister Suvendu Adhikari flagged off 22 bike taxis with commercial registration for plying in New Town and Rajarhat. The fare was fixed at Rs 20 for the first 2km and Rs 5 for each km thereafter.
 
 It has been decided that NKDA will set up   at various   of the main arterial road. “The   stands would have GPS facilities,” an NKDA official said.
 
 With many women passengers availing the bike taxi service, there is a huge demand for women drivers but availability of qualified women drivers has become a problem. The authorities expect to work out plans to have women bike taxi drivers soon.
