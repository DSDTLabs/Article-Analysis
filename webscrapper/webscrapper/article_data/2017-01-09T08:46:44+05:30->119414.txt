NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party ( ) will soon start its tried-and-tested poll strategy of door-to-door campaigning in all the 40 assembly constituencies in Goa that goes to poll on February 4.
 
  AAP’s chief ministerial candidate Elvis Gomes will lead the door-todoor campaign along with other local party leaders such as   and Valmiki Naik, party leaders told ET. Door-to-door campaigning has been a touchstone of AAP’s poll strategy that helped it win the Delhi Assembly elections two years ago. While Kejriwal toured the state on January 7 and 8, addressing four public rallies, he is expected to return on January 24 for another round of public meetings.
  
  Gomes, a former IGP (prisons) who took voluntary retirement last year, is contesting from Conculim in South Goa. AP has pitted him against Goa chief minister   on grounds of honest governance and a clean image since December 19 last year, when party leader Kejriwal announced him as AAP’s chief ministerial candidate.
  
  “We are the only party that has declared a CM candidate so far,” said   who is AAP’s election campaign in-charge of Goa.
