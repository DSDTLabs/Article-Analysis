Armie Hammer's wife   has said that the   star had to learn to cook after they became parents. Chambers said the 31-year-old actor was completely dependent upon her for food but had to start going into the kitchen after she got busy nursing their daughter   (now three). 

  
  
 "I had cooked for years and years and years... Since I was little... We were married for six years before we had children, and I made every meal from scratch every day. Then, when we had our daughter, I think after, like, week two, he thought he was going to starve to death or only eat take out the rest of his life! He was like, 'So... Are you gonna cook again, ever?' (I was like), 'I have a baby, I am nursing 24/7, you feed you!'" she said.
 
 The 35-year-old actor said her husband's cooking skills have improved a lot over time. "At that point, he kinda figured out how to feed himself. He became really into cooking. He literally could not boil an egg before, and then all of a sudden he's like, master of the omelettes, master of the grill ... It's been very convenient, I love it!" she said. 
 
 The couple, who has been married for eight years, also have a son,   (17-months-old) together.
