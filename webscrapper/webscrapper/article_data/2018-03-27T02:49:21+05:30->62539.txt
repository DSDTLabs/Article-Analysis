NEW DELHI: Acting or an order given by lieutenant governor  , traffic   have turned roads along  , Karol Bagh and   into no parking zones. A public notice has been issued asking car owners to look for alternate parking spaces in these areas.

 Police have identified over 40 points where encroachments can be removed to make the roads wider. The road will be levelled and re-laid with asphalt as potholes slow down traffic.
 
 “Vehicles found illegally parked in these areas shall be towed away and owners prosecuted. Special enforcement teams shall patrol these areas and prosecute violators on the spot,” said joint commissioner (traffic) Garima Bhatnagar.
 
 In addition, traffic policemen have also been asked to photograph the violations and issue notices to the motorists at their registered addresses.
 
 Illegal parking on these stretches is a major challenge for cops. Vikas Marg caters to close to 50,000 vehicles daily. To decongest it, police have proposed removal of some bus stops.
 
 Other roads identified by traffic police for decongestion include Patel Road (Pusa roundabout to Moti Nagar Chowk), Outer Ring Road (Hanuman Setu to Chandgi Ram Akhara) and Shaheed Jagat Narayan Marg (Netaji Subhash Place to Madhuban Chowk).
 
 In a meeting held last week, the LG had asked traffic police and the civic bodies to ensure that the stretches cleared of squatters are not encroachment again. He had also ordered the local police to take responsibility for maintaining encroachment-free stretches. Baijal also advised the three corporations to revisit their licensing norms for commercial establishments and link it with availability of adequate parking space.
