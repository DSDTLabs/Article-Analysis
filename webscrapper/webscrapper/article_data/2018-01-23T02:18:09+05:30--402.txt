Tiruvannamalai: Police arrested a 40-year-old AIADMK worker for assaulting Kalasapakkam MLA V Panneerselvam and damaging his car on Sunday night.

 The man, identified as Mani (alias) Manikandan (alias) Vasanthamani of Polur, attacked the MLA due to the latter’s failure to pay him the full cost for decorating the venue of a party function, police said.
 
 The incident took place around 9.15pm when the MLA reached Polur, to attend a wedding reception. Mani, who was waiting for the MLA at the marriage hall, accosted him and fell at his feet as if apologising to him. However, taking everyone by surprise, he got up and punched the MLA on the face and slippered him. The MLA’s supporters overpowered and thrashed Mani before handing him over to the police, officials said. 
 
 Mani told the police that he had decorated the venue for a function held at Kalasapakkam on the birth anniversary former chief minister M G Ramachandran, on January 17. After the programme, he approached the MLA to collect money. The MLA gave Rs 500 and Rs 6,000 on two occasions, and when approached for the remaining amount, the MLA gave him Rs 5,000 and allegedly abused him. 
 
 On Sunday evening, Mani went to the MLA’s home in an inebriated condition. Since Panneerselvam was not there, Mani broke the windscreen of the MLA’s car and went to the marriage hall, added the police quoting Mani’s statement. Superintendent of police R Ponni conducted an inquiry. Mani was remanded in judicial custody.
 
 MLA Panneerselvam, while talking to TOI, shared that he sustained injury on his lips from the attack. He however, denied any money transaction between him and the attacker and also stated that the attacker was not an AIADMK cadre.
