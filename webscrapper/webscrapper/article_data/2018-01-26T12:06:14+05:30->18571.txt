SURAT: A large number of devotees who had come from across the state to offer prayers at Zadeshwar on the occasion of  , got stuck in the middle of river due to low water level on Wednesday. Some had to walk through knee-deep muck to reach the shore.

 According to sources, at least 15 boats carrying devotees to   temple got stuck in the virtually dry riverbed due to low water level. They had gone to Gayatri temple across the river, but got stuck in the middle as the waters receded. They remained stuck in the middle of the river for over three hours. So the pilgrims in boats also wanted to perform puja by offering ‘chunri’ to river Narmada. They also were disappointed due to low water levels.
 
 A boat owner Sukhabhai Solanki said, “Minimum six-foot water is required to operate boats. But the water level was so low that the boats could not move. Before three years, hundreds of boats used to ferry devotees in the river on Narmada Jayanti, whereas this year there were hardly 15 boats.” 
 
 The water level rose only after some water (3,000 cusec) was released as from   in Narmada. Some pilgrims had prepared a 500 metre-long chunri to offer to river Narmada between Madhi Ghat in Jhagadia and   in  . But as there was no adequate water in the river, the size of the chunri was cut down to 125 metre. 
 
 Several temples on river Narmada from Kevadia to Bharuch perform aarti and puja on the occasion of Narmad Jayanti.
