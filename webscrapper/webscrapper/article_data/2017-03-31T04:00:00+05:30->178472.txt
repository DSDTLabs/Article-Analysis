Ankleshwar/Surat: The industries across Gujarat will have to shut down if they do not have Primary Effluent Treatment Plants (PETPs) to stop release of untreated waste into open trench or in water bodies, said additional chief secretary, environment and forests department, Arvind Agarwal, citing directives by the Supreme Court issued on February 22. State government has been directed to ensure compliance within three months that is by May 22, said Agarwal to members of industries association of Ankleshwar, Panoli, Jhagadia and Dahej on Wednesday. “Gujarat is far ahead in setting up environment treatment facilities, however, more is required to be done and that also with quickly to adhere to SC’s directives,” he said, explaining the SC order. “The indications are clear that by violating environment, no one can run business for a longer period so only way is to make industries aware and make them adhere to the directives,” Agrawal to TOI. Chandresh Devani, president Ankleshwar Industries Association told TOI, “There are several PETPs in here where small units send their untreated effluent for primary treatment which it then sent to Final Effluent Treatment plant for secondary treatment. In Apex Court order there is no clarity in case of such common facilities. A state level meeting is going to be held on Friday in Ahmedabad. All state associations may together approach Supreme Court for clarity on the issue.” The inlet limit at Final Effluent Treatment Plant (FETP) is 1,000 COD (chemical oxygen demand) where as in a consent issued to industries COD limit is 100, which required to be modified by Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB), said N K Navadia, former president of Federation of Industries Association of Gujarat, during the meeting with Agarwal.
