 "We both know, dog," Pharoah said.
 
 To which Hader quickly replied, "Yeah, it was Bieber.He was just in a bad place. Maybe he's in a better place, but then he was,it was rough."
 
 "Everyone's usually on great behaviour. Everyone's usually very excited and on great behaviour, most time it's 100 per cent, so that's why I think Bieber's the only one in my experience. And I think it was just he seemed exhausted or at the end of a rope," he added.
 
 Bieber appeared as a host and musical guest in 2013 to promote his album 'Believe'.
