When many were glued on to the TV, watching the 3rd ODI between India vs. Australia, these youngsters had some other plans. They didn’t want to miss out on their last chance to participate in the OPPO Chennai Times Fresh Face 2017 audition, which was held at Chennai Citi Centre. Their excitement reached its peak when the crowd started gathering around the venue and cheered the contestants.   From Bollywood and Kollywood numbers like Chikni Chameli, classical/contemporary dance performances, and beatboxing — this year’s mall audition saw all that. Our celebrity judge for the day was actress Sanjana Singh. She was quite kicked about judging the audition and said,”I am so happy to be here once again as a judge. It’s a great platform where we come across so many wonderfully talented youngsters.”    Sindhu I, who wowed the crowd with her mindblowing beatboxing skill, and Nikhil Solanki, who was too good with his contemporary dance moves, emerged as winners. Sourav Doshi, V Bobi, Supraja Ashok and Amanda Achu Jacob, came closely behind and won the first runner-up positions. While Bobi nailed his performance with flexible moves, Sourav, Supraja and Amanda won the hearts of the audience with their singing. Mohamed Tharik J and Pooja M, too, impressed the judges and were adjudged second runners-up.
