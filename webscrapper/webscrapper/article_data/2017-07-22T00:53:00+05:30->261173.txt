 Chandigarh: NGO Suvichar hosted a workshop at Ryan International School Chandigarh to apprise the youth on the importance of road safety. Suvichar is headed by Vivek Atray, author, advisor and motivational speaker.
 
 The workshop started with the reading of the holy Bible. Students of class XII made a power point presentation mingling careless attitude of teenagers on road and other ‘elements’ associated with high speed. The students in their presentation covered almost every problem that leads to traffic chaos, mismanagement and accidents. Neeraj from Suvichar in his address advised students to follow traffic rules for safety purpose. He guided students to be more humble and polite on road.
 
 Atray, during his interaction with students discussed the fatal consequences of drinking and driving. He named areas of the city where one needs to be more careful and attentive. He directed students to respect the road safety rules.
 
 He also spoke about self-control and recommended the 6 am test. “At this time of the day a driver gets easily tempted to ignore the red light signal because he is not under vigil. There is a need to change this mindset,” Atray said. Chairman of the school AF Pinto said, “Wearing the helmet is a style statement carried by our students and now we vow to spread it in the city.”
