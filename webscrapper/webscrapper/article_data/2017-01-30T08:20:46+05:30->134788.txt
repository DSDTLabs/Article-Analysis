LUCKNOW: Within an hour of SP president   and Congress vice-president  's joint road show in Lucknow on Sunday, BSP chief   said the alliance was being projected wrongly as aimed to stop BJP from coming to power.“The two have come together in a bid to stop BSP from forming the government with absolute majority,“ said Mayawati.

 The BSP chief attacked the Congress for bowing before the   at the behest of BJP despite knowing the “tainted“ credentials of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. “It is a known that BJP is using the CBI to arm-twist the SP leadership and   has admitted that on public forum,“ she said.
 
 The former UP chief minister said the Congress leadership was also aware of the SP's tacit understanding with the BJP. “Yet, the Congress allied with the SP. It is nothing but a big conspiracy,“ said Mayawati in a state ment. The BSP supremo said the jungle raaj of the incumbent government is also no secret. “People were harassed by goons of the ruling party...land was grabbed and corruption reached its peak,“ she alleged.
 
 Mayawati said Congress alliance with SP is similar to the one it had with BJP's Narendra Modi after 2002 riots in Gujarat. “Once again, Congress has joined hands with a party which was responsible for 2013 Muzaffar nagar riots,“ she said. Mayawati ad ded that in doing so, Congress has reminded people about the communal conflagrations in Meerut and Moradabad during its previous regime. Drive from Punjab: Mayawati is all geared to start her election campaign from Punjab. She would address a rally each in Kapoorthala and Barnala districts on Monday, as per the schedule. She would start her UP campaign from Wednesday addressing a rally each in Meerut and Aligarh.
