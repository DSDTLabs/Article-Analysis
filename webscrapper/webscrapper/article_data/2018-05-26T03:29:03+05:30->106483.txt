MANDSAUR:   on Thursday rolled out a ‘contest’ among party leaders in   and surrounding districts aspiring for tickets in the coming assembly polls. Whoever brings bigger crowds to AICC president Rahul Gandhi’s rally in Pipliamandi on June 6 will win the ticket.

 “Show your might. Let those who got more people to Rahulji’s rally get tickets; those who fail to do so will understand why they did not,” AICC secretary and MP in-charge   announced before a crowd of party leaders from Mandsaur, Ratlam, Neemuch and Ujjain on Thursday.
 
 The leaders had gathered to chalk out strategy to mobilise farmers to Rahul’s rally on June 6 to pay tribute to the farmers killed in police firing last year. Kapoor dubbed the rally as the “launch of Congress’ election campaign”. “I have appointed observers for every assembly segment. Carry your crowd under banners and posters made by you, showing your work. Tell the observers. They will keep a record,” the AICC secretary said.
 
 The Congress meeting in Pipliamandi saw party leaders of various factions come under one umbrella — including former MP   and her supporters who had quit against appointment of Rajendra Singh Gautam as state coordination committee member.
 
 The meeting resonated Congress intentions to project Mandsaur as the epicentre for its election campaign. Congress MLA Jeetu Patwari called out to leaders to show their might. “We should not falter here. If we put our might together, we will get over 2 lakh people to the rally. It will send a message to BJP that Congress will be in power in   this year and the Centre next year,” he said.
