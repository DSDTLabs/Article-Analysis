We also extended the payment due date many times, but the defulters did not bother to pay heed to our instructions. We were left with no option, but to seal the premises of the defaulters. The next step is to organise a public auction to sell these properties. In the first lot, we will auction 20 properties, most of which are commercial,” said an MCG official.
 
 The last date for payment of property tax was July 14. Till then, the government had offered a rebate and one-time interest waiver on the tax dues to property owners.

They have also been informed that the cost incurred in organising the public auction will be recovered from the sale proceedings,” the official said.
