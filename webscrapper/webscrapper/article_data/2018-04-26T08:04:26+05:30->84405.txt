JAIPUR: State   department swung into action and served notices to over 7000 private schools for flouting   (Regulation of fees) Act 2016 by not forming school level fees committee.

 The notice warns schools of losing their ‘no objection certificate’ and recognition from the CBSE. 
 
 “All these schools have been identified as those who have not formed the mandatory committee for deciding fees. Thus, the fees charged by these schools are illegal and they cannot collect the money till the matter is resolved,” said a government source.
 
 The Act says that fees have to be determined by a committee of 10 members. It includes five parents, three teachers, principal of the institution and a person from the management. 
 
 “The fees have to be decided six months in advance by the committee,” reads the Act.
 
 Many schools didn’t bother to form the committee and fixed the fees. The matter came to light when BVB Vidhyashram hiked its fees by over 20%. District education officer while inquiring fee hikes learnt that Vidhyashram school has not formed the mandatory committee.
 
 The anger of parents across the state over rise in school fees has forced the state to act swiftly. Schools have been given seven days to respond to the notice which clearly states that the state is empowered to cancel their   which is required to run a school. 
 
 “The NOC is also required to get the recognition and affiliation from the CBSE. If the state cancels the NOC, the schools will lose their affiliation as well,” said a government source. 
 
 Government is not taking any chance in the election year. It wants to be seen on the side of the parents who are worried over arbitrary fee hikes. 
 
 Earlier talking to TOI, state education minister   had told to have zero tolerance on schools flouting fees Act. The matter has become political as   party has joined the issue by staging protests and demonstrations.
