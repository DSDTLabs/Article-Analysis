CHENNAI: It was a day when there clearly wasn’t any clear winner in sight. The 5th round of the ongoing   in Germany saw all the five clashes ending up in stalemates on Thursday evening. While multiple-time World champion   split points with  , the outcome of the   and Yifan Hou too followed the same route. 

 
 The contests involving Matthias Bluebaum –Arkadij Naiditsch and Levon Aronian - Maxime Vachier Lagrave too failed to give decisive result.
 
 However, current World champion Magnus Carlsen found himself on the backfoot against Georg Meier before the former fought back and escaped with a draw. Despite a good chance to nail the big fish, Meier chose to remain optimistic. “I am not disappointed with my play (so far in the competition) although the result is not what I would like to have at this point. In rounds 2 and 3, I was hit by interesting novelties (against Nikita and Caruana respectively) which doesn’t happen often. Other than that, I was playing reasonably well,” Meier told the tournament site.
 
 On his performance in the tournament so far, Carlsen said, “I am still in the tournament for sure. Its not been brilliant so far but its never too late to start playing well. I hope to start that tomorrow.” 
 
 On Friday, the sixth round will see Carlsen facing Aronian while Caruana faces Yifan. Anand, on the other hand, will have Bluebam as his next opponent.
 
 At the moment, Nikita, Caruana and Maxime are in the lead with 3.5 points while Carlsen and Aronian are on 3 points apiece. Anand and Blubaum have 2 each in their kitty.
