To begin with, he met Haseena (prior to her death in 2014) and her family members to source detailed information about her life. He also interacted with the city’s cops to ensure that the  , produced by Nahid Khan and co-produced by Sameer Antulay and Babu Tyagi, remains as authentic as possible.
 The ‘real’ touch doesn’t end there. We now hear that the film has six of Haseena’s grandchildren playing the various ages of the protagonist, essayed by  . Apoorva says, “The story spans across 40 years. So, we needed 17 kids to portray various stages of Haseena — from a newborn to the age of 25. While casting, I realised that some of Haseena’s grandchildren fit that age bracket. That’s how they ended up in the film.” 
 Though family members were present on the set when he shot with the children, there was no interference from them, says Apoorva. “We had decided to make the movie the way we wanted to. So, there was no interference or questioning from any of the family members.” 
 Haseena Parkar, presented by Swiss Entertainment, releases on September 22.
