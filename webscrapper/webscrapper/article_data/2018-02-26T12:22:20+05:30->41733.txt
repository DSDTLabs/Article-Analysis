HYDERABAD: Chief Minister   on Sunday charged the previous   government and present Modi-led government at the Centre of failing to take concrete steps for the welfare of farmers. 

 Addressing the farmers at Rythu Samanvaya Samithi meeting,   said though he had discussed and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take steps for welfare of farmers, but the Centre has not come up with any scheme.
 
 Stating that a resolution would be passed in Telangana Assembly seeking linking of centrally-sponsored   to agriculture sector and will be sent to the Centre, KCR said miracles are needed to transform the lives of farmers and Rythu Samanvaya Samithis is one of the steps to ensure that farmers benefit from their agriculture produce. A unanimous resolution was passed at the meeting for sending the resolution (after Assembly passes it) to the Centre.
 
 Stating that TRS government has set the process in motion to set up Food Processing Units in every Assembly constituency, the CM said even the number of godown capacity has been increased from 4 lakh metric tonnes to nearly 25 lakh metric tonnes. He said the government would also extend rice planting machines on subsidy to the farmers.
