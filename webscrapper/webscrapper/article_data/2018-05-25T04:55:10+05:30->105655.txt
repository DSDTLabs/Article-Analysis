His father sent hsim again to the market to exchange the   with ripe ones. Prince went to the market with a cousin. The cousin picked up a fight with the fruit-seller following an argument over exchanging the bananas. 
 
 The fruit-seller later came to their home and said that the two boys had thrown about his wares on the street. Prince was reprimanded again, following which he is suspected to have taken the extreme step,”  , the local councillor, who is also a neighbour of the family, said.

Enquiries have revealed that the boy committed suicide upset over being reprimanded for buying raw bananas,” local police outpost in-charge Balram Sengar said.
