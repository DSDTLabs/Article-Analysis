BHOPAL: A Pakistan military court may have passed the 
   , but Bhopal police has been feeding and sheltering   Sajeed Muneer for almost a year after his release from jail.

 Sajeed Muneer was jailed for 12 years for espionage but after his release, Pakistan did not respond to extradition requests by the Indian government. By default, he became Bhopal police's responsibility and the district special branch (DSB) has been taking care of him for 10 months now. He is kept at a place near Koh-e-Fiza police station, one of the most picturesque locations of the City of Lakes, and DSB pays for his food and other necessities, say officers.
 
 Bhopal Police has repeatedly written to the police HQ to get his deportation process expedited but to no avail. Last week itself, the DSB sent another reminder to take up the issue with the ministry of external affairs so that the Pakistani spy is out of their hands.
 
 "Sajeed was released from jail on June 5 after 12 years of imprisonment for spying on Army bases in Bhopal for ISI," said a police officer. Sajeed was arrested in Bhopal in 2004 following specific intelligence inputs while carrying confidential defence documents.
 
 Investigations revealed that Muneer was lured by ISI while he was on a hideout after a murder case. He had murdered a Karachi youth to avenge his brotherâ€™s murder. While running away from the Karachi police he came in contact with an ISI officer who offered him a deal. Pak intelligence officer promised to save him from Karachi police if was ready to work for him in India.
