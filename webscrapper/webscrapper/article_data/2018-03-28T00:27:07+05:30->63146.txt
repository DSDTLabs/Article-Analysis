Salem: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Tuesday inaugurated three primary health centres - at Samudram, Pakkanadu near Edappadi and Connoor village near Attur - in Salem district.

 Addressing the gathering at the function held at Pakkanadu, which comes under the chief minister’s constituency, Palaniswami said, “Residents can now get treatment at their village itself, instead of going to Edappadi or Salem every time.” He further said Rs 60 lakh has been allocated for construction of a building for the PHC. 
 
 He said the government has also upgraded the government hospital at Edappadi at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore. “The hospital now has surgical theatre maternity wards and trauma care. Besides, under PPP, an X-ray digital machine and digital scan were also installed at a cost of Rs 2 crore,” he said. 
 
 The event was attended by health minister C Vijayabhaskar and collector Rohini R Bhajibhakare and other officials.
