CHENNAI: A small colony of fruit-eating bats, known as Indian flying foxes (Pteropus giganteus), have settled in a tree in the  , giving naturalists in the city a pleasant surprise. 

  founder   said a colony of 30-plus bats was spotted here a few days ago. Although crows have been seen harassing them, the bats seem not to be bothered, he said.
 
 Named for their dog-like heads, flying foxes have a sizable wingspan of around 80cm. The nocturnal mammals leave their roosting spots around 6.30pm and come back before dawn. 
 
 Chennai already has large colonies of these bats on the campuses of the  , Presidency College and Government Museum in Egmore. 
 
 They are found hanging upside down from banyan trees both at the Theosophical Society and the Presidency College. 
 
 These bats are generally considered as vermin as they are known to destroy ripe fruit, especially mango. However, this behaviour is compensated by their beneficial effects of pollination and seed dispersal. 
 
 While these bats mainly feed on fruit and nectar from flowers, they are known to eat insects and leaves on occasion. They also eat flowers, seed pods, barks, cones and twigs. The diet of these bats changes with the season, said Murugavel.
