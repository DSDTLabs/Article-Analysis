KALYAN: The Bhoir family, accused of killing   decorator   (37) by pumping him with 17   and grievously injuring his partner Nitin Joshi (45) last week over an alleged business rivalry, allegedly confessed to also   at one their staffers,   (26), whom they had kidnapped after committing the crime.

 Police sources said that during their interrogation, the Bhoirs reportedly admitted to taking Mahimdas to the Wai area in Satara district where they allegedly shot him and then dumped him in the valley.
 
 On Friday, police officers went to Wai with the Bhoirs and Mahimdas’s brother Ajay to look for him in the valley but could not trace him.
 
 Meanwhile, Dilip (51) and brother Shankar Bhoir (45) have reportedly confessed to killing Chaudhari. Dilip, though, has denied that his sons, Sagar (23) and Suraj (21), were involved in the crime, though they were with him when the shots were fired.
 
 The investigators, who had named all the four Bhoir family members as well as their other associates as accused in the crime, said they suspect that Dilip is trying to save his sons by making false claims. 
 
 Chaudhari and Joshi had bagged a Rs 6.5 lakh contract for interior work in a Thakurli flat, which the Bhoirs had also vied for. Cops said the Bhoirs were upset that despite their wealth and clout, Chaudhari’s family did not respect their wish. Earlier, the Bhoirs shared a cordial relationship with the Chaudharis. Police sources said the Bhoirs first assaulted the secretary of the building where   and Joshi had got the interior decoration contract but the two refused to stop work. The Bhoirs then went to the flat with licensed revolvers.
 
 The Bhoirs own several plots and recently started construction work on one in partnership with a builder.
