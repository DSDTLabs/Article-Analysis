NEW DELHI: In a fresh twist to the conflict in the Supreme Court,   general secretary   said on Tuesday that opposition parties had started discussions on the crisis triggered by four senior most judges of the SC 
  , adding that they may even consider moving an impeachment motion against the  . 

 “The independence and integrity of the judiciary are non-negotiable. As far as the legislature is concerned, the only option open to   is to tackle this through an impeachment motion. The point is to set the system right. If inadequacies are found, it is incumbent on the legislature and the executive to address them in the interest of democracy and the nation,” Yechury said. 
 
  
  
 
 Significantly, Congress, the largest opposition party, appeared to be mulling support to the move that party leaders called “serious”. While a final decision is yet to be taken with some party members said to be against such a “drastic” move, initial coordination appears to have taken place with others in the opposition. “Our leaders will sit during the weekend and take a decision,” a senior strategist said, underlining that the Budget session started on Monday. 
 
 
 
 
 The opposition parties are likely to use the   route to move the impeachment motion, where it has the backing of larger numbers. In  , the opposition, with its limited numbers, will find it impossible to find the numbers it needs. 
 
 However, for the motion to go through, it will need two-thirds support — a threshold those seeking the CJI’s impeachment may find difficult to cross because of BJP’s s opposition and the problem involved in roping in smaller parties. 
 
 Sources in BJP said they will not be party to the opposition’s move. A BJP leader termed the possibility of an impeachment motion as the opposition’s attempt to “intimidate” the judiciary.
