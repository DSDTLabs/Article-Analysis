 Calling the decision arbitrary and against natural justice and principals of the Khalsa Panth,   reiterated his demand for a judicial probe into the termination of services of 523 employees recruited in various institutions during his tenure. He said the ambit of the judicial probe should be expanded and all land purchases made during the tenures of other SGPC chiefs should also be probed.
 
 Expressing distress at the move, which reflected that appointments made during his tenure were in violation of rules, Badungar said these Sikhs were from poor families and were given jobs to help them earn a living.
