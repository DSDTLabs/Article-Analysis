 The Bhure Lal-led body has also directed all agencies to submit action taken reports on a fortnightly basis, with ground patrolling teams asked to ensure no waste is being burnt on the ground. Delhi alone has nearly 40 such patrolling teams which have been constituted to stop waste burning and to fine any violators.

 “Reports have to be sent back to EPCA and action has to be intensified on the ground. All municipal bodies have been informed,” said an EPCA member.
 
 In addition, Delhi and its neighbouring states have also been directed to ensure firecrackers don’t enter inside NCR, following the Supreme Court order. “States have also been asked to look into this issue and ensure that firecrackers don’t enter Delhi NCR as only the existing stock should be used. This will help in controlling the pollution levels,” said an EPCA member.
 
 EPCA is also planning to hold a meeting with both Punjab and Haryana in Chandigarh to address the issue of crop burning.
