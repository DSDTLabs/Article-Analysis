BENGALURU: Alert   personnel arrested a 35-year-old man when he was trying to break open an automated teller machine ( ) in  , near  , west Bengaluru, at 3am Tuesday. 

  U Harish, a welder and resident of Kottigepalya, was caught while he was trying to loot the ATM at the unguarded private bank kiosk. Police suspect it could be his second attempt at looting an ATM. 
 
  "Hoysala vehicle No. 92 was on night patrol and assistant sub-inspector   and constable Belliappa noticed a man squatting behind the ATM machine. They stopped the vehicle and slowly entered the kiosk. That's when they saw Harish removing the screws from the machine's door," police said. 
 
 Harish was unaware of police presence and was nabbed immediately.
 
 "According to Harish's statement, while drawing cash recently, it struck him that he could steal the cash bundles. Preliminary investigation indicates that this may be the second time the accused made a futile attempt to break open the machine," police said, adding, "We are taking the accused into custody for questioning. This may help throw light on his previous attempts." 
 
 "Despite repeated requests and directions, banks aren't deploying security guards at ATMs. In this case, the bank hadn't even fitted an alarm inside the kiosk," police added.
