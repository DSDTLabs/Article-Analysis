PUNE: A major   in one of the units of   at   around 56km from Pune on Thursday afternoon.

 The fire broke on the mezanine floor of the unit around 2.15 pm. The impact of the incident was such that it destroyed cable   and raw materials and engulfed the company’s office premises. No casualty was reported.
 
 The cause behind the fire could not be ascertained, said Vaibhav Tandel, station duty officer of the MIDC fire brigade. Tandel told TOI on phone that the company is well equipped with fire safety equipment, but non- availability of power supply hit fire fighting operations. He said the company employees used fire extinguishers to douse the fire, but they were not successful as it was enormous.
 
 Two fire tenders, two private fire tenders and seven water tankers rushed to the spot and started the fire fighting operation after receiving a call from the company. 
 
 “The firemen gained control of the fire after two hours. We then took four more hours to completely douse it and cool the premises,” Tandel added.
 
 The company’s HR official, Pravin Jadhav, was not available for comments despite repeated attempts.
