LUCKNOW: Boarding a high-end air-conditioned stae-run bus during the Holi period will be a little more affordable now. 

 The decision to reduce the fare of all high-end AC and   buses, taken in the board meeting of   (UPSRTC) on January 4, has been implemented. 
 
 The order to implement the change was issued on January 27. Fares of all high-end   and   buses have reduced from Rs 2.5 per km per seat to Rs 2.1 per km per seat. 
 
 This is a reduction of more than 18%. For example, if the fare between any two destinations was Rs 1,800, it would now be around Rs 1,400 for the same now, said a senior official. 
 
 The main reason behind curtailing the fare is to make high-end buses a preferred choice for UPSRTC passengers. 
 
 In case of Janrath buses, the reduction has been from Rs 1.6 per km per seat to about Rs 1.5 per km per seat. 
 
 The Lucknow-Agra bus service (3x2 seats) will now cost Rs 563 instead of Rs 583 while the 2x2 seats service will cost Rs 655 instead of Rs 708 per person. 
 
 Passenger occupancy for high-end AC buses in the state has been low. As a result, it was not a profitable venture for the corporation.
