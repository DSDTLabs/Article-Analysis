NAGPUR: A tough fight is on cards between the candidates for just 25 seats of   of Maharashtra and Goa, which would go for polls on Wednesday. About 164 candidates would be fighting for the prestigious elections to be conducted across the state. 

 Over 1.5 lakh voters on the Bar Councilâ€™s rolls are expected to cast their franchisee at various polling centres in state, according to the lawyers.
 
 The voters and candidates list has already been finalized and contestants were canvassing at various courts in the city. Since last few days, the campaigning picked up with contestants visiting all bar rooms to meet and request the voters to vote for them.
 
 Even the liquor and non-veg parties were being thrown to woo the voters in a big way. But those were organized clandestinely under the garb of birthdays and get-togethers. The contestants are not leaving any stone unturned to reach to the voters and even the social media platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook are being increasingly used for promotions.
 
 According to the lawyers, even this time, the polls would have political flavours with the candidates close to  ,   and other parties vying for the prestigious seats. Some of the candidates were also supported by the right wing organizations like the Sangh Parivar. The voters ruined the fact that political interference bring a bad name for the prestigious polls. Many old office-bearers of the Bar Council polls are in fray this time as well, lawyers told TOI.
 
  Candidates from Nagpur: Sangram Sirpurkar, Parijat Pande, Asif Qureshi, Anil Gowardipe, Sudip Jaiswal, Sunil Lacharwar, Kishor Lambat, Ishwar Charlewar, and  .
