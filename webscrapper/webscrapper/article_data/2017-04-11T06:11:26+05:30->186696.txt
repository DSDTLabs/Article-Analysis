MUMBAI:   frequented his mother’s flat at High Point CHS in Old Panvel as Hussein Patel and claimed he had taken it on rent.

 “Only when Hussein Patel was arrested in Pakistan in March 2016, we learnt through the media that his real name was Kulbhushan Jadhav and that he was actually the son of flat owner  . 
 
 As per our society records, Avanti Jadhav had purchased flat C-11 in 1991, but never stayed there. In 2007, Patel came to stay on rent,” said society secretary Sachin Shinde.
 
 He said Patel had claimed that he worked for a cargo shipping company. He visited the Panvel flat two-three times a month with a backpack and left in 15-20 minutes. “Once the door was left ajar and I saw a swimming suit and yacht equipment. One fine day, he loaded all the goods in a tempo and left the flat and never returned.”
 
 M J Gade, who has an office next to Jadhav’s flat, confirmed he never stayed in the flat. It seemed he used it as a godown, he added.
 
 On Monday, the security guard at   in  , where Jadhav’s father and his family stay, claimed the flats are locked and they were not in the city. 
 
 As a precaution, the police deployed around half a dozen constables outside the premises.
 
 Meanwhile,   authorities neither confirmed nor denied Jadhav’s stint. “Jadhav was two courses senior to me. He was famous for his physical fitness. He was quite active in sports and was a good performer,” said a navy officer.
 
 “He was at INS Shivaji between 1991-93. He even served as a staff officer for a brief period. Later, Jadhav opted for   (MCF). Consequently, Jadhav had joined the commando training centre at Kochi and completed the training,” the officer added.
