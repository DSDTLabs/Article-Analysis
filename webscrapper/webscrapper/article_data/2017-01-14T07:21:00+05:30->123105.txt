JALANDAR: Even as AAP convenor   continued repeating during his small nukkad meetings here on Friday that his party did not have the money or the manpower to fight the upcoming assmebly elections, the party showed its strength with a long cavalcade of cars during the Delhi CM’s roadshow in Jalandhar, the heart of Doaba region where the party is considered comparatively less robust than in Malwa. 

 After a long cavalcade of cars, whose number an AAP volunteer put at a “little less than 100”, reached Garha Chowk in Jalandhar Cantonment constituency, Kejriwal repeated his “not enough money and manpower” statement and asked volunteers to take responsibility to ensure that the party gets votes.
 
 The turnout at the six nukkad meetings Kejriwal addressed in four constituencies falling in Jalandhar was smaller than that of the vehicles. As the cavalcade made its way past the streets of Jalandhar, onlokkers rushed to shake hands with the Delhi CM. Kejriwal, however, skipped half of his scheduled meetings because he was unwell, said party leaders. 
 
 Kejriwal made it a point to reiterate that only a Punjabi would be the CM. “I am the chief minister of Delhi and I have been elected for there. I can’t be Punjab’s CM,” he said. “The Punjab CM will be from Punjab; he will not come from Pakistan,” he said, while also taking digs at   president Captain   and SAD chief  . 
 
 “After   gave the statement that I was known for remaining firm on my promises and I would deliver what I promised, Amarinder and Sukhbir got restless and issued the statements. Sukhbir is seeing me in his dreams,” he said.
