Kolkata: A 17-year-old girl from Howrah, who received the state ‘Birangana Award’ last year after she got her alleged trafficker, Ajima Bewa, arrested at Sealdah station, has added a new feather in her cap.

 Her evidence, together with the confidential statement to the magistrate, saw two of her traffickers being convicted on Tuesday in a Gaya Pocso court, which is likely to declare the quantum of punishment on March 27.
 
 “The two (Pacchu Singh and Chaya Devi) were convicted under ITPA (Immoral Traffic Prevention Act). The case came before the court in February 2015 and the duo was charged with sex trafficking and child sexual abuse,” said Adrian Phillips, spokesperson for Justice and Care, an anti-trafficking organization that was asked to look after her rehabilitation.
 
 The girl was 11 when she was kidnapped in 2012, drugged and sold to a brothel in Gaya. She was rescued in February 2015. While Pacchu and Chaya were nabbed the same day, Ajima (who had trafficked the girl through Sealdah station) remained elusive.
 
  In 2016, the girl spotted Ajima at the station. After a scuffle, police were called and Ajima was arrested. Her trial is still on.
