Music composer   found himself in a mild controversy after some followers alleged that the song ‘Kalyaana Vayasu’ from ‘Kolamaavu Kokila’ was copied from Sannan’s ‘Don’t Lie’ song. In fact, some of the users found similarities between both the songs and trolled Anirudh for being a copycat.

  Responding to the allegations, Anirudh clarified that he has acquired the license of the beats that come in ‘Kalyaana Vayasu’. Taking it to Twitter, Anirudh wrote, “5.5+Million Views in 4 days, 165K+Likes and still Trending at Number.Truly Grateful for this Support! And for the lack of awareness, I work with a lot of music producers worldwide and this beat is licensed from @beatsbymantra.”
 
 
  
 On the other hand, the song ‘Kalyaana Vayasu’, which was released on May 17, has gotten a fantastic response from the audience and has clocked in more than 5 million views on YouTube. More than the song, Yogi Babu’s mere presence has worked in favour of the composer.
 
 Reported to be a thriller, ‘Kolamaavu Kokila’ has actress   playing the lead role. Some reports say that Nayanthara will be seen as a drug peddler in the film. 
 
  Produced by Lyca Productions, ’Kolamaavu Kokila’ is directed by Nelson Dhilipkumar and stars Saranya Ponvannan,   and Jacqueline in supporting roles.
