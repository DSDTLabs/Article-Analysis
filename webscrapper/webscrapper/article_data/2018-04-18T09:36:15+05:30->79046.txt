SBI, which has swung into action to airlift currency from cash surplus states, expects the currency to be mobilised in the next couple of days. However,   ( ) Swaminathan J said: “I can’t reveal the names of states from where we will bring cash to augment our supplies.”According to him, the National Informatics Centre (NIC) has informed the state government that 52% of the 8,500 ATMs of all banks in Telangana are operational. “This reflects a 50-60% availability of cash from various banks in the state. At SBI, the availability across its 2,200 ATMs is 60%,” he said.

 “Being the SLBC convenor, SBI heads the Cash Management Committee that comprises 10 major banks in the state as members. There is no need for the public to panic. The Union government, RBI and banks are working in a coordinated manner to move currency from cash-surplus states to deficit ones like Telangana. 
 
 We estimate that in the next two to three days, the supply position in Telangana will show improvement,” Swaminathan said. According to him, RBI’s regional office too has advised that it will commence further supplies of currency from Tuesday. “The shortage is also being created by accelerated withdrawals due to fears of currency shortage. The Centre has already announced that RBI is stepping up the printing of 500 denomination currency notes. As per our reports, we expect infusion to happen in seven to 10 days. So by this month-end, we expect normalcy to be restored,” Swaminathan said.
 
 Bankers said that apart from accelerated withdrawals, there are many traders and   who are hoarding cash instead of depositing in banks.
 
 Rajeev Puri,   deputy general manager, Hyderabad Circle, told TOI: “We have around 85 ATMs in Telangana and we have cash availability in most ATMs. We are trying to move in cash from Chennai and Kolkata to meet the shortfall. We are also working on a branchto-branch shifting of cash depending on demand.”
