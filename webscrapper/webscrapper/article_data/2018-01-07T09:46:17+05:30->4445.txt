MANGALURU: Tributes have been pouring in for  , not only in kind words but in money too. Deepak’s mother Premalatha account has received over Rs 31 lakh in just two days, according to a friend of his. The amount is likely to soar over the next few days, thanks to the social media campaign launched by the BJP and the Sangh Parivar seeking financial aid for his family. 

 As per the bank statement at 4pm Saturday, Premalatha has received Rs 31,26,367. The campaign was launched across multiple platforms on January 4 evening.
 
 Brijesh Chowta of the BJP told TOI the fund-raiser was a spontaneous reaction from those who mourned Deepak’s death. “The campaign was launched on social media after Deepak’s funeral. We did not convene a meeting for this; it was launched by many people simultaneously,” he said.
 
 The posts were tweeted by many persons, including Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP Shobha Karandlaje.
 
 
 
 
 Chowta said the BJP’s   unit will donate Rs 5 lakh. This cheque may be handed over to the family by BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa. Former minister Krishna J Palemar will donate Rs 5 lakh in his personal capacity.
 
 On the day of the cremation, the state government had announced Rs 5 lakh while district deputy commissioner Sasikanth Senthil S handed over a cheque of another Rs 5 lakh from the district administration.
 
 Deepak, 28, was an executive at a mobile sim distribution company earning Rs 11,000 per month. His mother is a homemaker while his brother  , 26, is deaf and dumb. His father Ramachandra passed away some time back. Though the account receives funds from donors, Premalatha is not able to withdraw money since her account has not been linked with her PAN. Now, relatives have submitted details to obtain a PAN in her name.
 
 Deepak was murdered on January 3 a few kilometres from his house by fringe elements. The tying of buntings is believed to be the reason that eventually led to his killing.
