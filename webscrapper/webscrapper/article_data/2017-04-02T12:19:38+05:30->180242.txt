NASHIK: Tree lovers are ready to knock on the doors of the court again as they questioned the civic body why the trees on the farthest side of the road along the   compound were hacked for road widening.

 The issue was raised on the third consecutive day of the tiff between the   and the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( ) where the latter has been blamed for cutting trees on the   not acquired by it.
 
 Activists have accused the NMC of contempt of court as the 232 trees transplanted a few months back have already died.
 
 The civic body had proposed to widen the Gangapur road from Jehan Circle, from the existing 12 meter to 30 meter, at a stretch of five kilometer during the last Kumbh in 2002-03. The matter of land acquisition delayed the project though. 
 
 In 2014, the deadline to complete the road was before Kumbh Mela 2015. The land is yet to be acquired near Bhonsala Military School. “They have not been able to acquire the land for 14 years. Let them acquire the land first and then cut the trees. If the land acquisition would take some more years, these trees could have been there till then. They are not in the middle of the road and do not cause any accidents,” said Yogesh Shastri, an activist. According to the NMC, these trees were marked to be cut by the expert committee appointed by the high court. 
 
 The activists who reached the spot to stop the tree felling were told that the land was already acquired but when they went to the civic body and enquired, the scenario was different.
 
 Petitioner Ashwini Bhat said that as per the court’s orders none of the indigenous trees are to be cut. “Neem is indigenous. Land is to be acquired for road widening and trees are getting cut. These trees were touching the compound of the college. The contractor did not have the permission letter which is wrong. I will file a contempt of court as none of the transplanted trees have survived,” she said.
