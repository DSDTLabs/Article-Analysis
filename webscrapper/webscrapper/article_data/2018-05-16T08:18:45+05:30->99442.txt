LUCKNOW: Numerous bhandaras being organised in the city on the occasion of ' ' are creating traffic bottlenecks and causing frequent jams besides leaving behind mounds of trash at the site at the end of the day.  's laxity in enforcement of rules and lack of proper planning is to be blamed for the mess. 

 Despite May 15 being the third Bada Mangal, only around 1% of the bhandaras held across the city have taken due permission from LMC. Last year, LMC had given the responsibility to its private garbage management company   to ensure round-the-clock cleanliness around bhandaras. LMC had even announced special user charges to be paid by bhandara organisers, ranging from Rs 100 to Rs 500, depending on the food they distribute, but only 10-15 odd bhandaras paid the fee this year. Because of complete lack of enforcement of rules, more than 1,500 unregistered bhandaras have come up in the city. Since they are not registered with LMC, the corporation is unable to coordinate with the organisers to arrange for cleaning, safety of crowd, volunteers for helping people etc. An LMC official said, "While fixing user charges, it was decided that Eco-Green would see that all stalls keep dustbins, deploy volunteers to guide about waste disposal, arrange for sweeping in evenings too and ensure fire and other safety arrangements for visitors."
 
 LMC didn't spread awareness among organisers, nor has it enforced its rules. At most places, organisers have not put up dustbins. Some organisers have put dustbins but they get full soon.
 
 Atul Singh, a resident of  , who had organised a bhandara at   said, "Nobody informed us about the new rules. There was no communication from LMC either."
