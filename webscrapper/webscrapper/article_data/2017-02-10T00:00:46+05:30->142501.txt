Lalu Alex’s son Ben Alex’s wedding pictures at a register office had flooded the internet recently.
 
  Now the couple had an official ceremony which took place at the Holy Kings Knanaya Church at Piravom recently. Ben and Meenu Cyril had a traditional church wedding, according to Knanaya customs. Quite a few from the film industry dropped in to wish the couple, and actress Bhama turned up in a green full length gown. With fringed hair and light make up, she was a ravishing presence at the function.
  
  What surprised all was a visit from  ! Jayaram came with Parvathy and Kalidas, Parvathy looking ethereal in an ochre sari. Dileep and Bhama arrived alone, Bhama sporting a green silk gown with gold detailing. We also spotted actors Chippy, Captain Raju and Kunjan, among others.
