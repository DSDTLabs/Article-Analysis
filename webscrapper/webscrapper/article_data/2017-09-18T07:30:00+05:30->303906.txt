Chandigarh: To waive off fine of Rs 1lakh each on five colleges for the delay in the submission of their temporary affiliation application, the Panjab University affiliation committee sent a proposal to the syndicate for a final nod. The issue will be put up for discussion in the syndicate meeting that is scheduled on September 23.

 In an affiliation committee meeting for the academic session of 2017-18 which was held twice in the month of August, there was a unanimous recommendation stating that the authorities should consider waiving off the penalty. The committee recommend that the issue should be tabled in the syndicate for condoning the penalty imposed on the affiliated colleges which failed to deposit the request application for extension of affiliation for 2017-18.
 
 As per the norms of extension of affiliation for Science and other subjects, the college have to apply till November 1 of ongoing year preceding the one in which it is proposed to start the classes. As per chapter 7 of Panjab University calendar volume III 2016, in case the college delays in applying for affiliation, the university can impose penalty of Rs 1 lakh. The fine is imposed on those whose request for grant of the extension of affiliation is received after January 1 to January 10. 
 
 In 2014, a fine of Rs 2.5 lakh was imposed on a college for delay in submission of their affiliation form which was later withdrawn after the courtâ€™s direction.
