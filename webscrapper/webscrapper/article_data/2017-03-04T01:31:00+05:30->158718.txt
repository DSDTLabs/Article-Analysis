Mumbai: Western   (WR) services were affected during the morning rush hour due to a track fracture between Goregaon and Malad stations on Friday.

 WR had to cancel as many as 25 services due to the disruption on the slow corridor on the Borivli-bound route.
 
 “The fracture was detected by the gangmen at 9am. Due to this slow services towards Borivli were diverted on the fast track till 10.30am,” said a senior WR official. 
 
 “The fracture was found to 5cm-long. The diversion affected the punctuality of   services on all the four tracks,” he added. 
 
  “We could have temporarily joined the broken rail with a joggle plate. But it was not possible as the fracture happened at the switch-over point. As a result, we had to replace the entire rail,” said WR divisional manager Mukul Jain. To repair the lifeline, the WR administration had to bring a track-cutting machine at the site along with the material to drill holes to fix the joggle plate. The disruption resulted in bunching and cancellation of services. “There was a huge rush at platforms as there were no trains for nearly 20 minutes,” said Borivli resident Parag Jain. Several officegoers reached late to work due to the disruption. “It was difficult to board from Malad as they were packed with by commuters who had boarded the train from Malad,” said   Rajan Nair. 
 
 “I had to let go of a couple of trains before I could make an attempt to board,” said commuter Surekha Naik said.
