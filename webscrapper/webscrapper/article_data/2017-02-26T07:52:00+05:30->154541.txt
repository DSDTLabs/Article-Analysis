GURGAON: After waiting for about six years to claim possession of their flats in   Paradise, a   in Sector 83, homebuyers have now accused the builder of failing to pay the delay penalty and demanding arbitrary charges.

 According to the homebuyers, the builder had set 2013 as the deadline for the completion of the project. “We had booked the flats in the year 2010 and were promised possession within 36 months. Three years after missing its deadline, the developer has not paid us a single penny as the delay penalty,” said Jitender Agarwal, a buyer.
 
 Residents said the delay penalty has been mentioned as Rs 5 per sqft.
 
 The residents have also complained that they have already paid for the firefighting equipment mentioned in the builder-buyer agreement, but the builder has again raised a demand for the equipment. 
 
 “They have demanded electrification charges at Rs 80 per sq foot, apart from the firefighting charges from all the residents. But we have already paid these charges,” said Aditya Goel, an aggrieved buyer. TOI accessed a copy of the builder-buyer agreement which said if the government makes any changes in the specifications of the equipment, it can be charged from the buyers.
 
 Alleging apathy on the part of the builder, Goel added saying,“ We have held several meetings with Mapsko offiicals and we are told the owner’s instructions are being followed. The owner has refused to meet us,” Goel said. The residents have also reported their complaints at the chief minister’s grievance redress cell.
 
 The spokesperson for Mapsko builder was unavailable for comment when contacted through SMS on the phone and email. TOI will publish their views when they get back to us.
