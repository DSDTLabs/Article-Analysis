Jack White, a former member of The White Stripes, says he is more of a fan of hip-hip than rock these days because it is more "dangerous".

 "Rappers have the dangerous edge of   now - what I would consider the closest thing to that stuff you might not want your parents to know you're listening to," White told a newspaper. 
 
 The "Seven nation army" hitmaker recruited musicians that have worked with   and   on his new solo LP "Boarding House Reach".
 
  
  
 The 43-year-old musician says that critics would have preferred him to release new music like The White Stripes' 2002 album "Elephant" though.
 
 White said: "I hear a lot of talk about people listening to this album, saying, 'You don't even actually hear a song till you get to ' '. What they're really saying is, 'I'm not hearing a song that I want from   until 'Over and Over and Over.'
 
 "They want me to write songs like I did on 'Elephant'.
