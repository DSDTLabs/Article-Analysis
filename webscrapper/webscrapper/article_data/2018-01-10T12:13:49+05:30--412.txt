PUNE: A sessions court here recently set aside a magisterial court’s order of September 25 last year that issued process against four doctors from two city hospitals for alleged negligence in the treatment of a sitting NCP corporator, who died on September 6, 2016.

 Additional sessions judge R N Sardesai held on January 6 that the trial court magistrate ought to have waited for an expert panel’s report from the medical board of the   — as is mandated by the   (SC) guidelines related to prosecution of doctors in cases of negligence — before issuing process for trial under Section 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code against the four doctors.
 
 “The impugned (under challenge) order deserves to be set aside and the matter needs to be remanded back to the trial court for hearing afresh,” judge Sardesai said.
 
 “The trial court shall call the report from the medical board of Sassoon hospital in relation to the alleged negligence and decide the matter afresh,” the judge said, adding that the earlier evidence adduced by the complainant be also considered during the fresh inquiry under Section 202 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 
 Senior lawyer  , who represented the doctors, had argued that the trial court failed to appreciate the ratio laid down by the SC’s 2005 ruling in the   vs State of Punjab case, wherein specific guidelines were laid relating to criminal proceedings against doctors only after securing an independent opinion from a government hospital’s medical board.
 
 He pointed out that the medical board of the Sassoon hospital in its final opinion on October 12 and 17, 2017 — after the trial magistrate’s impugned order — clearly said that there was no negligence in treatment on the part of the doctors.
 
 Referring to the evidence on record, judge Sardesai held, “The trial court should have postponed its order about issue of process till the receipt of the report of the expert committee of the Sassoon hospital medical board. According to the SC guidelines, the trial court should have received and seen the report before passing the impugned order.”
