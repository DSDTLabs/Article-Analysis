JAIPUR: Milk donation banks in Rajasthan have found that many lactating mothers in the state may have unknowingly passed the deadly HIV virus to their offspring while breastfeeding.

 Out of the 16,578 women who donated milk to banks during 2017, the milk of at least 1.57% tested positive for HIV. Experts say this could be the tip of the iceberg as not all lactating mothers give milk to banks.
 
 "The women, who donated their milk to the milk banks in 2017, were unaware that they were   or that they had Hepatitis A. They came to know about it only after they donated their milk to the bank. Before distributing milk, we have a system of testing the same," said Yog Guru Devendra Agarwal, state advisor of the government's Aanchal Mothers' Milk Banks.
 
 Rajasthan is the only state to have established 11 milk banks, with seven more in the pipeline.
