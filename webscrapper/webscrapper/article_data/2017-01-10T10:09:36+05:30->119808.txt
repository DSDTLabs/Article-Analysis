KOCHI: The high court has upheld Kerala Universityâ€™s decision to implement the regulations brought in by   (UGC) in May last year that aims to improve quality of research programs but limits the number of scholars a faculty member can take.

 A single bench of the court upheld the adoption of UGC (Minimum Standards and Procedures for Award of MPhil/PhD Degree) Regulations, 2016 by   in July last year after considering two petitions filed by candidates who applied for admissions to MPhil in March last year. 
 
 The petitioners had alleged that their opportunity to be research scholars has been considerably reduced by the adoption of the   as it introduced restrictions in the number of candidates who can be attached to a guide or supervisor.
 
 While a total of eight research scholars were normally admitted under a guide earlier, the regulations stipulated that a professor cannot guide more than three MPhil scholars at a time. An associate professor can guide up to two MPhil scholars and an assistant professor can supervise only one MPhil scholar, the regulations specified.
 
 The petitioners had also contended before the high court that the university cannot deviate from the prospectus as the selection process was already over when the regulations were adopted.
 
 Responding to the petition, the university submitted to the court that while the regulations came into effect on July 5 last year, only a provisional rank list was published on its website on August 25 last year. Through an order issued in October last year, it has been decided to allocate research supervisors from affiliated institutions of the university to solve the shortage of guides, the court was told.
