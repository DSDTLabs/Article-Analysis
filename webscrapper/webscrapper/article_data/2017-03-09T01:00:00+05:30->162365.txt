Neeraj Pandey’s directorial ' ' had proven to be a hit amongst the audience when it released in 2015. Now, the same team is back with another mission led by Shabana Khan, played by Taapsee Pannu. Titled 'Naam Shabana', the film, directed by Shivam Nair, is said to be India’s first spin-off of a successful franchise.
 
 In Baby, Taapsee’s character had resonated with the audience and now, the same character has been spun into a full-length film of its own. Baby had several memorable characters — Akshay Kumar as Ajay Singh Rajput,   as Shuklaji, Rana Daggubati as Jai Singh Rathore and   as  . The film was credited for ushering in a new era of action-thrillers in Indian cinema.
 
 Says Neeraj Pandey, “I remember sharing this idea of a spin-off with the crew and cast and the one thing that struck me was that everyone was extremely positive and inquisitive about what all could be done with it. Each one of us felt that this just needed to be told. Shivam’s take on this story is a treat for the audience that liked Baby.” 
 
 With Naam Shabana, the team heads off on more daring missions as they put the country before themselves yet again. The spin-off will also see new characters essayed by Manoj Bajpayee and Prithiviraj, who join the Baby team on a new mission.
