JAIPUR: The stalled Ring Road project will now be handed over to the   (NHAI) for completion before assembly polls in December 2018.

 A final decision terminating the contract of   JV will be issued soon.
 
 Peeved with constant delays and infighting, the Rajasthan government has decided to end the agreement with the present developer.
 
 After receiving assurance of Centre’s support from Union minister Nitin Gadkari, the empowered committee decided to terminate San Jose-Supreme and appoint NHAI to construct the 47km stretch.
 
 “As of now, we have not received any orders from the headquarters. However, there are indications that the responsibility will be given to us. If that happens, NHAI will be able to finish the project on time,” said a NHAI official of the Rajasthan regional office.
 
 At a meeting held on January 10, top officials had decided to take the central agency’s help as a last resort.
 
 In June 2011, the   (JDA) had selected the joint venture between San Jose-Supreme for the Ring Road project. As per the contract awarded to the firm, work had to be completed in 24 months.
 
 “There was a consensus that the present developer will not be able to meet the deadline. The road should be completed by October 2018. The empowered committee will soon take a final decision,” said an official who is privy to developments.
 
 According to sources, there is no precedence of NHAI being asked to carry out such infrastructure projects. Gadkari has given his word following the insistence of chief minister  .
 
 He has even promised to be present during the inauguration of the Ring Road next year.
 
 “The project will still take at least one year after completing the land acquisition process. It will take another 3-4 months to start work as NHAI will also have to invite bids,” said an official.
