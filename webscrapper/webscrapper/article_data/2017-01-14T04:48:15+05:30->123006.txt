NEW DELHI: Placing its largest ever aircraft order,   on Friday announced it will buy up to 205   planes worth $22 billion or Rs 1.5 lakh crore at list price. The low-cost carrier ( ) increased its existing order of 55 single aisle B 737-8 by 100 to 155 planes. An additional 50 planes — mix of wide body and B 737s — have been placed as optional order, taking the total to 205.

 The 155 planes on firm order will be delivered between 2018 and 2024. The list price of firm order of 100 additional planes placed now is $11billion.
 
 “We are evaluating the low-cost long haul model for which an optional order for wide body planes has been placed. There is a good market for this segment in India if a good product is offered at the right price. Imagine the demand that a fare of Rs 10,000-15,000 on   will have,” SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh said.
 
 Asked how the airline will fund this aircraft acquisition, Singh said: “There are several options like sale-and-lease-back and   open to us. We will opt for the most economic funding route. There will be no dilution of equity and no debt will be raised in coming years for this order.”
 
 SpiceJet currently has 32 B-737s and 17 regional jets in its fleet. Singh re-acquired the LCC two years back when it was on the brink of closure.
 
 “In 2014, SpiceJet lost almost Rs 3 crore daily. The airline has been back with us for 680 days and in that time, it has had a profit of Rs 1 crore a day. This is one of the most dramatic comebacks by an airline globally,” Singh said.
