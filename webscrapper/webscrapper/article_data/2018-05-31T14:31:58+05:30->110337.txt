LUDHIANA: Harpreet Singh (25) of Johlan village, a   employee, allegedly tried to end his life under mysterious circumstances inside Lohat Baddi police post of   on Wednesday morning.

 
 Police officials said Harpreet had come to the police post to lodge a complaint into a theft of Rs 2.5 lakh at a sewa kendra in the area on May 29. In the complaint, Harpreet told cops there was a rush of villagers at the kendra on May 28, and Rs 2.5 lakh were collected from them as bills. As they got late in collecting the bills, they kept cash at the kendra, and did not deposit it in Ludhiana, but next morning they did not find the cash there. 
 
 However, police got suspicious of Harpreet as the   camera of the service centre was switched off. Disturbed over police questioning him instead of acting on his complaint, Harpreet inflicted injury on his neck and tried to end his life. Caught off guard, cops rushed him to a private hospital in Raikot, where doctors referred him to a private hospital in Ludhiana after his condition worsened. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Investigation (Jagraon)   said they were verifying the facts.
