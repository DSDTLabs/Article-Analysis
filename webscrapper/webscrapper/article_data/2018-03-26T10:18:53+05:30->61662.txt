JAIPUR: Panic gripped   on Sunday after a   strayed from   (RNP) and entered a house. Acting on the information, the forest official team and Bholi police administration in   reached the spot. After a nerve-racking exercise of two hours, the forest team succeeded in tranquillising the leopard. A forest guard at RNP said, “As there were many bushes around the houses it was difficult to tranquillise the leopard. The team entered a safe place inside the house after breaking a window and shot the dart. The leopard entered the village as he was probably hungry or thirsty.”
