Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday issued notice to the Centre and the Punjab government on a plea seeking directions to look into suicides by farmers and farm labourers in the state.

 The division bench comprising Justice S S Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan issued the notice after taking cognizance of an application filed by Malkeet Singh Balianwali and others seeking the revival of the issue as the Centre and Punjab had failed to take any action on the problem.
 
 The petitioners told the HC that they had earlier filed a petition seeking directions to take appropriate steps for tackling the alarming rate of suicides by farmers and farm labourers in Punjab. Their petition was disposed of by the HC in July, 2015, directing the Punjab chief secretary to look into the issues regarding suicides by farmers and farm labour and to take remedial measures.
 
 According to the petitioners, a copy of the July, 2015, orders was supplied to the chief secretary in September, 2015, but no response from the state was received till date. They submitted that the situation regarding suicides by farmers and farm labourers was “very grave”.
 
 Referring to various media reports, the petitioners asserted that 16 farmers committed suicide in the first month of the formation of present government in March and the number had increased to 26 the next month.
 
 Seeking directions for revival of the previous petition, the counsel for the petitioner argued that the matter needs to be looked into by the HC, as the state authorities have completely washed their hands of the serious issue. The matter would now come up for further hearing on July 25.
