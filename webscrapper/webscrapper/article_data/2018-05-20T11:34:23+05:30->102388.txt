HYDERABAD: A few days ago about 150 stray dogs were allegedly poisoned and dumped in a forest area on the outskirts of the city. Though this may have come as a shocker for dog lovers, it isn’t the first time that man has turned against his proverbial best friend with such barbarism.

 
 Talking about the death of the stray dogs,  , chief executive officer of   ( ), said, “We did find a few carcasses of stray dogs but we are still waiting for post-mortem reports. Police are on the lookout for the people who committed this heinous crime.”
 
 
  
 
 News of stray dogs crammed into cages, poisoned, burnt alive or subject to some other form of cruelty isn’t new. Activists say that most people are committing these crimes because in our country the administration is incapable of bringing in the Animal Welfare Act.
 
 “Repeated incidents of brutality on animals are happening because the penalty amount is so little. People escape by paying a small fine of Rs 50. These offences are bailable and sometimes the perpetrators are not even arrested,”   said. Activists rue the fact that despite increased awareness about animal rights in the city, such cruelty persists.
 
 “Stray dogs are subject to the worst kind of torture, which kills many of them. We have rescued dogs suffering from worst forms of torture in the past. Most are often pounded to death or killed for no reason,” said  , an animal rights activist.
 
 In another incident that occurred in July 2016, a disturbing video of about eight teenagers burning three puppies alive, even while they were shrieking for life, went public.
 
 Before that there was another video showing the boys carrying the hapless pups, holding them by their tail, to the graveyard in   area, where they were eventually burned alive. What’s worse is that the cruelty is captured on video for posterity.
