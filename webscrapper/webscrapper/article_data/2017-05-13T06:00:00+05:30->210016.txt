Tridha Choudhury, who made her Tollywood debut with Nikhil’s   in 2015, is all set for a comeback. The actress is playing one of the leads in Manjula Ghattamaneni’s next film starring   and Amyra Dastur. “It’s been two years since I made my debut in Tollywood, so it’s great to be back again with such a nice script. After Surya vs Surya I went on to do a TV serial Dahleez and that got me busy. A lot of people out here kept asking me what am I doing next in Telugu. So here I am as my TV show got over a while back. I’m super excited,” says Tridha.

 Prod the actress about her role, and she reluctantly replies, “All I can reveal as of now is that I play a Goan in this emotional love story. She is very outgoing... a very spunky young lady who is very westernised in her outlook. It’s a very realistic as well as happy-go-lucky film. And all three of us (Sundeep,   and me) play totally contrasting characters which is something to watch out for.”
 Tridha is leaving no stone unturned to prep up for her role in the film. “Somebody recommended my name to director Manjula, so that’s how I got this film. And when she met me, she said, ‘this should be your comeback film in Tollywood’. I thought why not put in my best,” she says adding, “It’s been a month that I’ve been taking Telugu classes and learning the 
 language. In fact, even when I’m in Mumbai, my assistant directors send me voice notes in Telugu which I can hear and learn. Even during the shoot of Surya vs Surya, I would try talking to Nikhil and the unit people in Telugu, so now I can speak and understand the language very well. You see, it is always good to greet the people in their language right?.”
