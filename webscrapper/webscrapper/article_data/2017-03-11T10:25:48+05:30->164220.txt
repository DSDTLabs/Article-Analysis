NEW DELHI: Chief minister   has gained an insurmountable lead on the Thoubal constituency seat. BJP's Leitanthem Basanta Singh and rights activist and PRJA chief   was contesting against him from the Asembly seat.

 The elections in Manipur this time are a crucial test for the 15-year-old Congress regime which is facing a stiff challenge from the BJP. The BJP leaders criticised the ruling Congress for its alleged failure to solve the over three-month-long economic blockade paralysing the two national highways of the land-locked state, which was the key issue in the first phase of polls in Manipur.
 
 The other important issues exercising the minds of voters are the alleged lack of development, massive corruption, misappropriation of funds and worsening law and order situation in the state.
 
 Almost all the big names in the state's politics like the chief minister himself, deputy CM M Gaikhangam and Irom Sharmila, among others contested in the second phase of the Assembly polls in the state.
 
 The state's 19,02,562-strong electorate comprising of 9,28,573 male and 9,73,989 female voters has voted in record numbers during the 2017 polls in the state.
 
 As the counting progresses, all eyes are on Sharmila who broke her 16-year fast last year and floated a party of her own - the 'Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance' to fight the Assembly elections in her quest to get the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act - AFSPA repealed.
