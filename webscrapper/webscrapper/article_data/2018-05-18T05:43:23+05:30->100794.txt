MOHALI/AMBALA: In what seems to be a fallout of gang war, a youth was found shot dead on Samgoli Road, near Derabassi, on Thursday. Vivek Rana’s hands were tied at the back with a cloth when police recovered his body from a jungle. According to police, the victim’s body bore about eight bullet injuries in neck, temple, arm, abdomen and shoulder and his wrist was also fractured.

 Sources said as per preliminary investigation, it seems to be a result of gang war as Rana’s arms were tied and he was brutally murdered. The cops also suspect that he must have been murdered somewhere else and his body was dumped at Samgoli village.
 
 A team of forensic experts, along with a dog squad, also reached the spot. Derabassi station house officer inspector Mohinder Singh said, “Around 8.40am, a passerby spotted the body lying near a meat plant in Samgoli village and informed us. We found the youth in a pool of blood with bullet injuries.”
 
  SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “Vivek is a native of Shamli village in Meerut but was kidnapped from Barara, near Ambala, two days ago. An FIR was registered at Barara police station. So we will be handing over the body to them. A zero FIR has been registered under Section 302 of the IPC and it will be forwarded to the Ambala police for further investigation.”
 
 Vivek went missing under mysterious circumstances from Barara on Tuesday morning when he left his home for a court hearing at Deoband in Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. A case of kidnapping was registered at Barara police station following the complaint of Abhishek Rana, a cousin of the victim. Police said in his complaint, Abhishek had named Monu Rana, Gautam, Shakti, Sachin and Amar, all residents of Barara, as suspects.
