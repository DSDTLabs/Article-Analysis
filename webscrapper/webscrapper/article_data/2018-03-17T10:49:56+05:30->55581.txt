ALLAHABAD: A lawyer sustained injuries when a country-made bomb went off after being dumped in a garbage pile in front of the   under   police station in the city on Friday. 

 The injured lawyer was taken to the Tej   (Beli) Hospital where his condition is said to be stable. 
 
 Police have cordoned off the area and a forensic team was also deployed but no other live bombs were found. 
 
 Inspector of Colonelganj police station Rakesh   said, "Preliminary investigations show that some miscreants had dumped a bomb in the garbage. The bomb went off after some vendors tried to burn the waste. It was a low-intensity blast and many lawyers were returning from the court rooms of Collectorate when it went off."
 
 The injured lawyer   was passing the garbage pile when the bomb exploded. 
 
 "He was immediately admitted to the hospital and is still in a state of shock. His injuries are not of serious nature," Singh added. Meanwhile, lawyers condemned the incident and have lambasted the police administration for not maintaining enough security in and around the Collectorate.
