SURAT: Alarm bells have started ringing for the world’s leading diamond mining companies, including   and Alrosa because of a slowdown in demand for lower-value rough diamonds, mostly manufactured in Surat by small and medium diamantaires. Demonetization was cited by De Beers and Alrosa as the reason for the slowdown in demand for lower-value rough diamonds in November and December. Small and medium diamond manufacturers in world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing centre in Surat are facing liquidity crisis ever since the government on November 8, 2016 scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes to root out black money from the Indian economy. 

 “Demonetization is likely to have an impact on several of our businesses so we need to respond in a right way. It’s likely we may continue to experience its impact in the Indian industry in the coming months too,” De Beers CEO   told sightholders this week at Gabarone in Botswana.
 
 The slump in demand has been most felt by smaller diamond manufacturing units as independent jewellers placed fewer orders amid a sharp decline in consumer spending on gold and diamond jewellery. 
 
 Gems and   (GJEPC) officials said the import of rough diamonds fell five per cent at $1.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion in the same month in previous year. The import of rough diamonds between April-December-2016 had increased by 25 per cent at $12.6 billion compared to $10 billion during the same period in previous year. 
 
 “Large manufacturers are largely unaffected by demonetization. However, small and medium units owners are facing severe liquidity crisis. They are unable to buy rough diamonds due to shortage of currency. The import of lower quality rough diamonds will continue to remain hit in the coming months as well,” diamond analyst   said.
