AHMEDABAD: A team of city police’s   (SOG) recovered Rs 60 lakh, which were embezzled from a bitcoin account sealed by the Ahmedabad zonal unit of the narcotics control bureau ( ) in connection with a case registered in Surat. Investigators said they have initiated the process to seize property of the other accused, who used his share to buy properties.

 SOG officials said NCB had registered a case in 2016 against one of the agency’s inspectors, Satyendra Kumar Singh, who had handled a case in Surat where youths were sending banned psychotropic drugs (anti-depressants and stimulants) to US-based customers using an online platform. 
 
 Singh had allegedly forged a letter on the NCB letterhead issued to a Bengaluru-based company, to unfreeze a bitcoin account. For the job, Singh allegedly got Rs 63 lakh and Rs 60 lakh went to Dipak Mangukiya, an accused in the case.
 
 B C Solanki, ACP (SOG), said that they have recovered Rs 60 lakh, Mangukiya’s share, from his friend Ketan Sutariya, a resident of Surat. “Mangukiya had given the money to Sutariya for safekeeping. After learning know about the transaction, a team visited Surat and recovered the money. We have also initiated the process to seize Singh’s flat in  , which was purchased using his share,” said Solanki.
 
 Investigators said Singh has been suspended from the NCB after the case. This case, registered a month ago, was perhaps the first one where bitcoin, a crypto-currency, was seized and then siphoned off from a law enforcement agency’s custody.
