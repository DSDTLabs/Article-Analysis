PATNA: In a first, the   has taken it upon itself to "introduce" the   election candidates to the  . 

 "The administration will put up posters in every ward. The posters will contain a brief profile of the candidates of the ward," DM Sanjay Kumar Agarwal told TOI on Monday.
 
 The posters, to be put up two days after   are allotted, will have the name and the symbol besides details of educational qualification and criminal history, if any, of the candidates. 
 
 Agarwal said the administration has taken this initiative because candidates are not allowed to put up posters after the implementation of model coded of conduct. "However, voters need to know about those in the fray so that they can make a choice," he said.
 
 According to him, a special team has been formed to ensure compliance of the model code of conduct. "People should inform us if they come across any instance of model code violation," the DM said.
 
 The administration recently lodged FIRs against two candidates in this regard. "One candidate was found helping people get piped water supply to their houses while the other had put up posters in his ward," the DM said.
 
 The polling is scheduled for June 4. The process of filing nomination began on April 29 and will end on Tuesday. After the scrutiny of the nominations from May 11 to 13, candidates can withdraw their candidature on May 16.
