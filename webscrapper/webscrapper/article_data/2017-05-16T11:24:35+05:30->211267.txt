Indore: Rumours about early announcement of the ICSE Class XII result have thrown the examinees and their parents in the city in an anxious state on Monday. 

 Though there was no official declaration about the date of announcement of the results, some news reports on social media were creating confusion among them since morning. 
 
 The same was the scene all over the country that resulted in large number of people logging on to the official website of Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE). This caused website crash in the morning. 
 
 “I got an update on a news app about the ICSE results being announced today. My son had appeared for the exam this year and I was eager to know his result. I was in office and immediately called up my son to check it online but couldn’t find anything,” said Sheetal Rana, a working professional. 
 
 Sources in the ICSE told TOI that results of Class X boards were most likely to be announced this week but due to some documentation, the work has been delayed by a few days. 
 
 The board officials said they have been noticing that rumours about announcement of results are doing the rounds from past one week. ICSE is putting in all efforts to declare them at the earliest. 
 
 “We hope students will get enough time to choose their career. It’s only a matter of few days. Both Class X and XII exam results will certainly be declared at the earliest,” said a source from board.
 
 After the website crash, the board had to release an official statement denying about result announcement on Monday.
 
 ICSE students and their parents also tried to know about this calling up the schools. The school authorities made it clear to the students that it was just a rumour and there is still time for the results to be declared.
