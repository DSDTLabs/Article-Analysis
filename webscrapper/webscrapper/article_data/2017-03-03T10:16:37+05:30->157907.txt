 The   would be conducted on March 4 and 5. The students allotted schools would have to confirm their admission in respective institutions between March 6 and 15, stated the revised schedule released by the primary education department on Thursday.
 
 The notice stated that the parents would have to confirm the admission of their wards at the schools allotted to them within the time period as declared in the revised schedule. The parents failing to do so would be considered out of the RTE admission process.
 
 In case the schools do not give admission under any pretext, parents would have to complain to the grievance redressal cells nearest to them.
 
 “If a student has been allotted a school by the centralized online admission process and has all the required documents to validate his/her candidature, no school should refuse to admit that child. In case any school refuses to admit the child despite all the required documents, then action according to the RTE rules will be taken against the school concerned,” said Goving Nandede, the director of primary education, in the letter.
