KOLKATA: The ruling Trinamool Congress is faced with the challenge of shedding flab in the nomination tally in most districts when the process of withdrawals begin from Thursday.

 
 One such district is Malda, where there are 56 Trinamool candidates for a total of 38 zilla parishad seats. The scene is no better in  , where there are as many as 72 Trinamool candidates for 50 zilla parishad seats. And Birbhum has 46 Trinamool candidates for a total of 42 seats in the topmost tier.
  
  
 As usual, Trinamool candidates in panchayat samiti and gram panchayat levels across districts far exceed the number of seats.
 
 Trinamool insiders say that some more candidates were fielded to ensure there were some people to contest in case the nomination of the other got cancelled during scrutiny. But a peek at the list of candidates after scrutiny on Wednesday points to a greater malaise: the Trinamool rebels. Party managers will have a trying time dissuading these candidates in the coming three days till April 28.
 
 According to political observers, this may lead to a spurt in intra-Trinamool feud in parts of Malda, Murshidabad, South 24-Parganas, North 24-Parganas and Hooghly.
 
 In Malda, party president   is not very confident of calling back all the rebels from the fray at a time the party is riddled with factionalism between two camps led by Sabitri Mitra and  . In English Bazar, Swapan Mishra, a close confidant of  , had filed nomination as a Trinamool candidate. But on the last day of filing, zilla parishad member  , who had won on a CPM ticket last time and later switched to Trinamool, could file her candidature. “Our CM said that sitting candidates would be given tickets,” Jasmin said. Falguni Tudu also filed her nomination at Habibpur where Pravas Choudhury already began his campaign as a Trinamool candidate.
 
 The running feud may get worse in South 24-Parganas, where the party has witnessed bloody clashes between the “new” and “old” Trinamools.
