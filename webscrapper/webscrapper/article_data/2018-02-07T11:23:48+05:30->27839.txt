NASHIK: An FIR has been lodged against the headmistress of a private English medium school in the   area for allegedly beating more than a dozen std III students with a stick on Tuesday morning.

 The   police lodged the FIR following a complaint filed by an aggrieved parent. The police said that the headmistress was apparently infuriated over the bad handwriting of the students.
 
 In her complaint, the parent said her daughter and the other students had been summoned to the headmistress’s office with their writing copies around 10 am. “She was angry at the quality of handwriting of these students, including my daughter, and started beating them mercilessly with a stick. When I went to pick up my daughter after school at around 2 pm, she showed me the marks on her legs and was crying,” said the parent. The police said the other parents were also angry and had protested on the school premises, demanding removal of the headmistress. A police team rushed to the school and pacified the agitated students and parents.
 
 The headmistress was taken to the police station to prevent her from being targeted by the angry parents.Senior inspector of   Road police station Pandharinath Dhokane said the police would formally arrest the headmistress on Wednesday and produce her in court. Neither the headmistress nor the school authorities could be contacted for their comments despite several attempts.
 
 “Two of the students went to the local hospital to get first aid. They have medical certificates to show they had sustained injuries on their legs,” said Dhokane.
