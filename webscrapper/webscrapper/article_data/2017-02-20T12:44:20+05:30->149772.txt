In the wake of the recent incident, wherein a prominent Malayalam actress was allegedly assaulted, and this has given rise to umpteen discussions among people in Kerala. Filmmaker   was one of the film personalities, who chose to talk about the same on social media. 

 However, he was hinting towards hidden double standards in the 
  industry, when he posted, “99% of our movies are celebrations of heroism. All our love stories, family dramas and even campus stories uphold the flagship of patriarchy. Most of them carry antiwomen ideology in them. It is nonsense to expect a truthful stand in support of the actress from the film Industry. Can these heroes stay away from the hero worshiping movies from now onwards?.”
