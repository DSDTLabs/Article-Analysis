PATNA: The district administration is gearing up for the January 21   against child marriage and dowry.

 Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Patna district magistrate (DM) Kumar Ravi assured that the administration would leave no stone unturned to make the event successful. “A meeting with senior cops was held two days ago to discuss the safety measures to be adopted. While a sector in-charge and a police officer will be stationed after every 1km, a coordinator will be present after every 200m,” the DM said, adding a special traffic plan had been prepared as many people would voluntarily participate in the human chain.
 
 A control room with a team of auxiliary nurse midwives (ANM) and medical kits will also be set up after every 1km. Hospitals, on the other hand, will be asked to be alert and keep ambulances ready in case of any emergency.
 
 DM holds meeting with private school heads: In a meeting held with the principals of different private schools on Friday, DM Kumar Ravi laid emphasis on the security of children.
 
 “The DM has instructed all the schools to keep complaint boxes that have to be opened every day by principals or teachers. He has also asked them to install CCTV cameras and fire extinguishers as soon as possible,” a source said and added, “Schools have to conduct fire drills at regular intervals and train students and teachers to face natural disasters.”
 
 The DM said he would cancel the registration of schools without GPS (global positioning system) and emergency doors in their buses. “Schools have to fill 25% of their seats with underprivileged kids. They also have to ensure the availability of first aid kits and conduct police verification of non-teaching staff,” the source told this reporter.
