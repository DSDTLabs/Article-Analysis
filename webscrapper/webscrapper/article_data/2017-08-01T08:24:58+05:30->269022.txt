DIBRUGARH: The crackdown against militant groups in the run-up to Independence Day in Dibrugarh district resulted in the arrest of two hardcore NDFB (Songbijit) militants on Monday. 

 Dibrugarh SP   said the two rebels - identified as   (29) and   (24) - were nabbed by a joint police and army team from the Rowmari area of Moran based on intelligence inputs. One 9mm pistol, one .22 caliber pistol and 19 live bullets were found in their possession along with several incriminating documents. 
 
 "We have been keeping a close eye on the Moran subdivision border areas since various militant outfits have been trying to set up temporary hideouts there. The dense jungles and easy accessibility from the state borders make it a preferred shelter for militants. However, our alert forces have foiled their attempts every time," the SP said.
 
 In recent times, the Karbi Anglong-based militant outfit UPLA (United People's Liberation Army) has also been trying to set up camps in the area. Security forces in the last three months had nabbed eight UPLA militants, including two women cadres, in three separate instances from there. The crackdown also led to the recovery of four .22 pistols, one 7.62 pistol and a large cache of bullets from the UPLA cadres.
 
 "We suspect the two NDFB (S) cadres are part of a group trying to flee security forces. Their members have been on a run following the massive crackdown against them by various security agencies and the NIA," the SP added.
 
 Due to the relentless action, the NDFB (S) has of late been fighting with their backs to the wall with depleting cadre strength. According to intelligence reports, the ultra group may be left with only 150 cadres, as compared to the earlier strength of around 300 with most of them hiding in Myanmar, including its chief Songbijit and other senior commanders like D Bidai and K Batha.
