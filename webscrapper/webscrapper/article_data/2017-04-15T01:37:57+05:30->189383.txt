NEW DELHI: Yogendra Yadav’s   released its manifesto for the upcoming municipal elections on Friday. The party said its main focus will be on environment, public health and sanitation. For this, the party has proposed sweeping of roads at night and a zero-waste management plan.

 In a 32-page booklet, the party has talked about the targets it aims to achieve. “Pollution and sanitation are key issues that directly affect people. Roads should be cleaned at night. We propose to bring a scheme under which we will encourage people to segregate waste. This will help in bringing down the load on landfill sites. We will install CCTVs at dhalaos,” said Yadav.
 
 The party promised to give incentives to RWAs for planting trees and grass, building more public toilets, especially for women, giving licences to street vendors etc.
 
 Last month, the party had released its vision document in which it had shared its plans for the city on various aspects of municipal functioning. The manifesto has a lot in common with it. In the manifesto, the party has highlighted areas where the BJP, which is the ruling party in all the corporations, has failed or under-performed.
 
 Yadav spoke in detail about the party’s plan for increasing the revenue. While he agreed that the state government is not providing adequate financial assistance to the corporations, he blamed BJP for doing little to boost its revenue. Yadav pointed out that BJP didn’t do much to generate revenue from toll, parking and advertising.
 
 On the issue of property tax, it slammed Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his party for playing politics over the issue ahead of the elections. “It is a bad idea to do away with property tax, which is the principle source of revenue. It should be charged as those paying it are not poor people. In fact, all pending tax should be collected without imposing any penalty,” he said.
