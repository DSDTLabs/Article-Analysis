 almost stopped short of an endorsement for her "Sex and The City" co-star  , who is in the running for the office of New York governor.

 The 53-year-old actor said she is looking forward to talking to Nixon about her bid.
 
 "Cynthia has been my friend and colleague since we were little girls. I look forward to talking to her about her New York state gubernatorial bid," Parker said in statement to an online portal.
 
 Nixon received rousing endorsement from another "SATC" alum  , who tweeted in support of the actor the day she announced her campaign.
 
 "I am so proud of @CynthiaNixon, no one cares more than she does about EVERY person getting a fair change and a good education. I know that she would be an excellent Governor!" Davis had written.
 
  also backed Nixon, who played career-driven lawyer,   on the hit show in a reserved tweet.
 
 "I support and respect any former colleague's right to make their own career choices," she had said.
 
 Nixon, 51, earlier told a magazine that all three of her "SATC" co-stars have "expressed love, support and excitement" about her political debut.
