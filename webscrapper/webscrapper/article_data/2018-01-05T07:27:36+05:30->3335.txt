HYDERABAD :IT comanies in   are not keen on taking weapon licences for arming security personnel despite terror attack tipoffs by police and Society for   (SCSC).

 Deployment of the antiterror outfit,   (Octopus) remains a stillborn idea. Now, SCSC is preparing emergency response procedures for thwarting terror attacks on different clusters of Hyderabad’s IT corridors.
 Speaking to TOI, Society for Cyberabad Security Council general secretary   said, “There are around six IT clusters in Cyberabad, including  , financial district and Raidurg. We are evolving emergency response procedures for each cluster for better coordination to react to a terror attack or human-made or natural disaster.”
 
 He said, “We asked IT companies to arm their security personnel. Only few companies bought rifles and sought gun licences. Many IT companies are looking at it as a risk.”
 
 According to Bharani Kumar, Octopus sleuths and specialists of Cyberabad police have given tactical training to security personnel of IT companies. “Security personnel form the first level of defence when any attack happens. So far, four batches have been trained. On January 20, the fifth batch will be trained in tactical training,” he said. To improve communication between security supervisors of various companies, instant messenger apps are being used and the command control centre of Cyberabad will also communicate on need basis.
 
 Cyberabad Security Council asked the state government to deploy a unit of Octopus commandos in the IT corridor for swift response in the event of an attack. “Currently, Octopus is located in Begumpet and a unit at Shamshabad airport. IT corridor is a key area and always on terror radar. A small unit shall be located in IT corridor,” said senior police official.
