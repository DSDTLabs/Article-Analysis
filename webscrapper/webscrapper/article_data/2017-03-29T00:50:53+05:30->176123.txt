 Madurai: The judicial magistrate court in Melur in Madurai on Tuesday rejected a petition by the president of Jallikattu Peravai, P Rajasekar seeking permission for him to go abroad. 
 
 The Madurai police have registered a case against Rajasekar in connection with the operation of illegal granite quarries. When he wanted to go abroad, he was not allowed due to the pendency of the criminal case. 
 
 Thus, he filed a petition before the judicial magistrate (JM) court. The JM R Selvakumar heard the petition. 
 
 The petitioner said that the case has been pending from 2011 and he was fully co-operating with the police. There was no warrant pending against him. Travelling abroad is his fundamental right, which should not be curtailed citing pendency of criminal case, the petitionerâ€™s counsel said. 
 
 The special public prosecutor argued that police filed a charge-sheet in the case and the case has been committed for trial, in which a summon has been issued to the petitioner. Hence, his petition was liable to be dismissed. 
 
 Following it, the magistrate dismissed the petition.
