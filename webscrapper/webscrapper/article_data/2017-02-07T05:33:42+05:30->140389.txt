ALLAHABAD: Besides their own natal chart, some candidates of the UP assembly elections are turning to   to get even those of their rivals examined to know whose favour the results will be in. As wary of the stars and the planetary position as   have been, they are concerned about the   (auspicious time) to begin their campaign from, what should be the colour of their vehicles and what clothes would help them yield best influence on the voters. 

 Some have appointed astrologers full time to manage their campaign while others are seeking advice of experts, asking them to scrutinise the horoscope of their opponents.
 
 “Many astrologers are examining janma   (natal chart) of candidates for the information of the latter’s rivals,” said Narendra Giri, mahant, Baghambari Mutt and president, Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, denying being the adviser of any candidate. 
 
 “It provides assurance to my client,” said an astrologer on condition of anonymity, evading the question on whether he saw victory coming the candidate’s way or not.
 
 Noted astrologer Fanindra Nath Tripathi said business of astrology has gained momentum with every candidate seeking to know the weak ‘grah’ (planet) of the rivals. 
 
 “Minor problems can be set right with the help of ‘havan’ and ‘grah shanti’ rituals and it is impossible for a candidate to win if the opponent’s stars are stronger,” said another astrologer. Two prominent astrologers of the city said most of their clients are assuming BJP candidates as their immediate rival.
