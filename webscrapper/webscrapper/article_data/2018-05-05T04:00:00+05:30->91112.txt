Surat: A part of a dilapidated building named Adeswar Park collapsed in Athwalines in the city on Friday. The four floor building was being demolished when a portion of it collapsed. There were no casualties.  The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials said flat owners of Adeswar Park were given notices, asking them to vacate the building because it was not safe. The flat owners had decided to demolish the structure and rebuild a new one in its place.  Zonal chief of Athwa S G Khatiwala said, “Two floors of the building had been demolished and remaining two along with ground floor were being demolished with the help of a poke land machine when a slab collapsed. Luckily, no labourers were injured.”  SMC had identified 38 properties in Athwa as dilapidated and issued notices to the occupants for repairs and demolition. Of these 38 buildings, 24 are undergoing repairs, whereas five have been demolished. Over 200 properties in the city are in a dilapidated condition. SMC has issued notices to all the occupants, but has not taken any other action. There always remains a chance of a major mishap in dilapidated buildings.
