DOHA: India'   produced a brilliant four-under on back nine to card two-under 70 and recover from a rough start in the first round of the   golf tournament, here on Thursday.

 Chawrasia, winner of two titles in 2016, including Hero Indian Open on the Asian and  , opened with a birdie on the par-5 first, but then went into the dreaded rocks and cacti on the par-4 sixth.
 
 But the small built Indian star fought back on the return journey with four superb birdies on 10th, 13th, 15th and 17th for a two-under card, which placed him tied 43rd.
 
 "I'm really happy to come back after a triple bogey on seven. I hit a drive left and my ball was in a lot of stones so I took a penalty drop and then chipped out. On the fourth shot, I hit the green then three putted from over 30 feet. That was very disappointing,"   said.
 
 Chawrasia was delighted with his recovery and said, "It's Republic Day so I got a lot of messages this morning and I replied to many of them. It's a big celebration back home and in the end I am also happy with my back nine.
 
 "After that (triple bogey), I told myself that I could still save the round as there are many holes left and I then made a few birdies on the back nine and came back. I'm looking forward to another round."
 
 Thailand's 27-year-old Kiradech Aphibarnrat raised the possibility of a first Asian champion at the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters after the big-hitting Thai carded a six-under-par 66 in the first round.
 
 But he was third behind Welshman Bradley Dredge (64) and Finland's   (65).
