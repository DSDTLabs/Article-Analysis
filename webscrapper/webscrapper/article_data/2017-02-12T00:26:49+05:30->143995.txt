, a Swiss-British philosopher and self-help guru, has written on a wide array of subjects such as travel, happiness and religion, but it’s his pop wisdom on love and marriage that has made his books bestsellers. He’s even been called the Facebookers’ Freud. Ahead of Valentine’s Day,   speaks to the man who wants to put realism back into romance         Relationships are hard for everyone but we all tend to suffer very individually, with a strong sense that we must have done something wrong. My article cut through the sentimentality and insisted that even the best relationships are markedly tricky, and also that through a wise accommodation with the difficulties, we can actually improve our lives. I stressed in particular that pessimism is an important asset in relationships: it helps us to prepare for the challenges of living together and moderates some of the brittle and cruel hopes we sometimes bring to other people.        There are rumoured to be a few people on the planet whose love lives are without problems. Currently, some search parties are on the lookout for them, and there is hope they will be identified by the end of the year. But more seriously, it’s a much better starting point to assume that love will be difficult than to budget on it being problem-free. After all, the only people we can think of as normal are those we don’t yet know very well. The greatest romantics live on their own.        We’re all free to make up our own rituals on this day, and the opportunity is there to turn it into an occasion when we can examine our relationships with our partners in an honest and consoling light. Very often, relationships get brittle when two people are carrying around a lot of resentment. They have hurt one another, but haven’t managed to find a way to tell each other about the hurt. The ideal Valentine’s night is one where a long-established couple manage to share the hurts, overcome them, and rediscover new channels  of feeling.        The main change has been in me. My first book, Essays in Love, looked at love through a very romantic lens. It assumed that the only reason love can’t work is because you are with the wrong person. What I have learnt since, and it’s the basis for my new novel, The Course of Love, is that even with the ‘right’ person, love will be tricky. Also, the real challenge is not how to get into a relationship but how to stay in one. Long-term love is what we all want. Tinder, and other apps, always privilege the start of love. I look forward to an app that will help us stay in love, not start new relationships constantly.        My new vows place the emphasis on mutual understanding. It remains stunningly hard to understand another human being, whether one is in lust with them or not. Part of the problem, for example, is that we rarely say exactly what we mean. ‘I’m too busy to see you’ may actually mean ‘I’m really keen to see you but am worried you don’t want me…’ We’re a very tricky and perverse species, and in love, we need to learn the art of emotional translation.        An open marriage would be a terrific idea, if it were not for one thing: jealousy. It is always going to be hard to care for someone and stay utterly blithe while they spend a night with someone else. Monogamy didn’t become a norm for no reason. It’s deeply challenging but it is rooted in solid facts about us.
