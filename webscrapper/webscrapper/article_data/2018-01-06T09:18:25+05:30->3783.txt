 “The BJP and saffron outfits have brainwashed her not to accept money from me because I’m a Muslim,” he said. “The family has accepted Rs 10 lakh given by the government,” he said. 
 
 “I will use the money to donate three water coolers – one to the Ganeshpura temple, another to a mosque in Katipalla and the third to church in Katipalla – with his photo. Let people drink water and bless him for years to come. I wish they had accepted the money,” a grieving Bava said.
