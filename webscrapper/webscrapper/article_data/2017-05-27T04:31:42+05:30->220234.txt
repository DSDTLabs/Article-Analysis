The   of the Pune police will seek help of the   to trace the suspected transfer of funds to the US by   Devidas Sajnani, arrested for allegedly cheating at least 4,000 people promising them bungalow plots or handsome returns on investments.

 “We suspect Sajnani has transferred substantial funds to his son staying in the US,” said senior inspector Rajesh Puranik of the EOW on Friday. “We shall soon seek help of the ED on this matter.” He added that Sajnani could have made huge investments in Karnataka and Kerala and even committed similar offences in the past.
 
 Investigations revealed that the 440-acre land at Pingori village in Purandar taluka, used for allegedly cheating people, was a part of the green zone. “The conversion of plots to non-agriculture use and construction is not possible there,” Puranik said.
 
 Sajnani was arrested on Wednesday by the EOW for duping at least 4,000 people. He had floated a company, Temple Rose Real Estate, with four others. They advertised a project of non-agricultural 1,000sqft bungalow plots at Pingori for initial investment of Rs 1 lakh-Rs 3 lakh. If   were not interested in the plots, the company assured returns of 20-25% per annum on investments.
