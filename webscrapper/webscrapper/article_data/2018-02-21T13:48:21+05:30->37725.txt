PATNA: An FIR has been lodged against current and former Lakhisarai DMs   and Sunil Kumar respectively in connection with alleged embezzlement of several crores of rupees meant for plantation of trees under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Gurantee Act scheme.

 Amit Kumar is a 2012-batch IAS officer while Sunil Kumar, currently posted in the state social welfare department as director, is six years senior to him in the all-India service. 
 
 Police said the FIR was lodged by the Town police station in Lakhisarai on Tuesday on the orders of Lakhisarai   Narayan Das Sharma. The CJM passed the order on February 16 on a complaint case filed on the basis of information sought through an RTI application by one   Singh.
 
 Besides the two bureaucrats, Green Leaf Energy Private Limited proprietor Manish Dayal has also been made an accused in the FIR. Green Leaf is a Gaya-based firm which was the alleged supplier of plants to Lakhisarai. “The embezzlement took place between 2012-2013 and 2017-2018. Tuntun has alleged that government funds were disbursed on the basis of forged master rolls of workers and forged supply vouchers,” a Lakhisarai police officer told TOI over the phone.
