COIMBATORE: Mohammed  , who was admitted to the   (CMCH) on Monday after suffering a heart attack, continued treatment at the hospital’s convict ward on Tuesday.

 The 53-year-old man is a convict in the 1998 bomb blast case. He was arrested recently after his recorded telephonic conversation with a truck contractor, in which he spoke about planning to kill Prime Minister  , was widely circulated on social media.
 
 Rafiq, who has high blood pressure and hyper tension, complained of chest pain and shoulder pain on Monday night, police sources said. “He was immediately rushed to CMCH and admitted in the intensive care unit. Electronic cardiogram (ECG) was taken and other tests were conducted. Doctors said that there was no major change in the ECG but since he stated he was still in pain, he was provided necessary treatment. He was kept in observation in ICU until Tuesday morning after which he was shifted to the convict ward,” a police officer said
 
 “His condition had stabilized. He has been shifted to the convict ward and is being monitored there. He will be monitored for two more days,” resident medical officer   told TOI.
 
 A bail petition filed by Rafiq was rejected earlier. His relatives said that they will file the petition again. Rafiq had recently undergone an open-heart surgery and is unwell, they said.
 
 In the eight-minute telephonic conversation, Rafiq is heard saying, “We have decided to kill Prime Minister Modi.” He went on to say, “We were the ones who planted bombs during (  leader) LK Advani’s visit to Coimbatore in 1998.”
