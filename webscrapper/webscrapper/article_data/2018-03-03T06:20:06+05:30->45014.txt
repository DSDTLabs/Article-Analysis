MYSURU: In a bid to ensure voters are not swayed by cash or kind from candidates, the Mysuru district administration has launched a  . 

 It will prepare a vulnerability map of the district, plotting where voters are most likely to be bribed. Based on the map, authorities plan steps to check the malpractice.
 
  Speaking to TOI, Deputy commissioner   revealed that the idea behind this exercise is ensuring free and fair voting. He said the vulnerability map will present a clear picture and will help authorities curb illegal practices. 
 
  "We have directed the police and officials of other departments to prepare a report on how and where voters can be influenced," he said. 
 
 "Officers will prepare a report based on ground realities and the district administration and police will then sit together and prepare a roadmap to make these elections free and fair. We will educate voters through Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation ( ) and keep an eye on day-to-day developments in these constituencies. We will carry out confidence-building measures in these areas and ensure people vote without the fear." 
 
  The district administration's decision has been appreciated by civil society. According to  , a retired   engineer, muscle, money and rampant distribution of alcohol and other goodies is a common phenomenon in rural areas. "I hope the practice is eradicated with this new initiative. Once money and muscle power is negated, voters will cast their votes without any influence."
