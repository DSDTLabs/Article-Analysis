CHENNAI: The state transport department has sent a   to all the   instructing them not to operate ‘special’ services unnecessarily and has warned of action against those violating the norm. 

 Operation of special services with less number of passengers is causing over servicing, which has in turn had an impact on the earnings, the department said in the written communication to managing directors of all the corporations. 
 
 TOI in its recent report explained how corporations were operating buses scheduled to be operated as   as special ones, forcing passengers to pay one and half times the normal  . 
 
 A government order, issued earlier this year, introduced a new provision allowing surge pricing of bus   in the name of special services during weekends and festivals. Never such a provision existed before the   fare hike, and this was seen as a move to boost the transport corporations’ crumbling  . This provision was misused by corporations operating   even during regular working days, the report said. 
 
 Against this backdrop, Tamil Nadu State Transport Undertakings, chairman’s office instructed all the corporations not to operate special services unless the estimated earnings per km (EPKM) is more than Rs.30. Action would be taken against the concerned officials, if they operated special services not meeting the criterion said the letter, a copy of which is with TOI. 
 
 Despite the letter, passengers at the CMBT in Koyambedu complained that many buses bound towards Thanjavur, Madurai, Coimbatore and other districts, were operated as special services during this extended weekend. Ticket   of private omni buses also shot up, with tickets to Madurai, which normally costs Rs 600-Rs 900, being sold for Rs 1,000 each.
