HYDERABAD: Reacting strongly on the rape and murder of 8-year-old in Jammu & Kashmir and a minor's rape in Uttar Pradesh, actor and Jana Sena Party ( ) president   on Saturday said perpetrators of crimes against women and eve-teasers should be publicly flogged. 

 "Like Singapore, this should be introduced and strictly implemented across India," he said. "Eve-teasers should be publicly whipped. Only if there is fear of instant punishment, will it deter people from indulging in eve-teasing. The culprits should be publicly shamed and whipped," he said before a protest rally at   against the rapes in Kashmir and UP. 
 
 Pawan said offenders of crimes against women should be severely punished. "A judge recently said the genitals of those who commit rape should be cut off. This is how vexed the country is about crimes against women," he pointed out. "There are laws in the country which are supposed to safeguard women. But the rich or the influential go scot-free when they commit crimes against women. We need stronger laws," he said.
 
 After the protest, Pawan spoke to the media. Fielding questions, the JSP chief said he did not approve of actress  's semi-naked protest describing it as "sensationalism."
