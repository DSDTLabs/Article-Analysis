DHARAMSHALA: Mumbai batsman   has been called in as “emergency cover” for  , whose right shoulder injury has not yet healed. While there is no confirmation yet that Kohli will skip the Test, TOI has learnt that Iyer has been called in as a “precautionary measure” in case Kohli is unable to take the field. It will be a huge blow for India if they are to lose their leader ahead of this decider.

 Iyer, who had a brilliant 2015-16 Ranji season and scored a double hundred against the Australians in a warm-up match recently, was playing the inter-PSPB tournament final in Delhi on Thursday. He is expected to join the squad on Friday, just a day ahead of the fourth Test. If Kohli is unable to lead, Ajinkya Rahane is expected to take his place.
 
 
 
 
 The Dharamshala pitch is acquiring a balder hue as days go by, but any accidental build-up of cloud cover will still help pacers generate immense swing at this altitude.
 
 As of Thursday, the team management was toying with the idea of playing Bhuvneshwar Kumar if they opt for an extra pacer, instead of punting on the recovering Mohammad Shami. “Although no final decision has been made yet, Shami is technically not part of the squad. He has been nursed and kept with the squad in this series to facilitate faster recovery and ensure he sticks to his diet and fitness routines. He is not part of the playing XI plans as of now,” said a source.
 
 Though Virat Kohli had earlier hinted that Shami could be in the scheme of things he remains a doubtful starter. The Indians are known to play their cards close to their chest, unlike the more decisive Aussies who have no qualms in making their lineups clear before a Test.
