Ahmedabad: Were city cops sent on a wild goose chase by right wing groups, who chased couples away from the Sabarmati riverfront, ostensibly to ‘protest’ celebration of Valentine’s Day? Sources said senior city police officers on Tuesday had a meeting with members of such groups and apparently warned them not to hold protests or they would be detained.

 However, according to sources, these groups told the cops that they would court detention after their protests at various locations in the city.
 
 “We did not agree and gave them a strict warning not to take the law into their hands. The group then departed,” said a police officer.
 
 On Wednesday morning, police received a call with information that right wing groups were assembling at Usmanpura to then hold protests against Valentine’s Day at various places. The caller also told them the right wing groups had sticks with them.
 
 “Police forces were then deployed at Usmanpura and the nearby Riverfront areas to detain the protesters. While the cops kept waiting at Usamanpura, protesters thronged the riverfront near Dadhichi Bridge, chasing couples away with sticks,” said a source.
 
 According to sources, the cops were mute spectators as right wing groups forced couples to leave and at some places even pushed them around.
 
 The cops belatedly swung into action and detained 20 members of right wing groups from Vadaj and Naranpura areas. “Of the 20, an FIR was lodged against four — Jimit Suthar of Ranip, Vishal Vanand of Ranip, Pappu Yadav of Memnagar and Dilip Yadav of Ambawadi — for carrying wooden sticks in cars and creating a ruckus. They have been booked for violation of the police commissioner’s notification prohibiting the carrying of weapons,” said a senior police official. After the morning’s incident, bandobast at the riverfront was beefed up. “We made sure that no other incident occurred,” added a police official.
