Thanjavur: Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit visited Thanjavur on Monday to participate in cultural programmes and to host review meeting with government officials. However, netizens and locals were not happy with the ‘special effort’ taken by authorities to clean the city in nick of time. Ahead of the governor’s visit, the state highways department took up repainting and cleaning of centre medians in the roads accessed by governor, which was widely criticised by people on Facebook users and other social media platforms through memes for the sudden affinity shown towards beautifying the city. According to official sources, Purohit would inaugurate Tyagaraja 171st Aradhana music fest at Thiruvaiyaru on Tuesday and would also participate at the valediction of Salangai Naadham dance event organised by South Zone Cultural Centre on Monday night as a part of his two-day tour in Thanjavur. As the governor would access the Medical College Road stretch to reach South Zone Cultural Centre near Rahuman Nagar, days ahead of his visit, it is said that state highways department roped in workers to repaint the dividers and median openings of the particular stretch while Thanjavur Corporation workers were seen clearing the silts accumulated on roads. Residents of Medical College Road seeing the sudden beautification works in nick of time stated that if not for the visit of a high profile person, the road would have remained the same. “Though we are happy that medians were painted at least now, it is quite shocking to see at least 5-6 workers supervised by a person, completing painting works racing against time. If the governor had not come to Thanjavur, such pace of work would not have happened,” A Faiz, a resident of Medical College Road told TOI. Residents also questioned the authorities on why no such works were completed in this manner during normal days.
