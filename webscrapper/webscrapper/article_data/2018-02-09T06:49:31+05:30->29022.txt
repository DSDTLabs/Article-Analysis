GANDHINAGAR:  , which is staring at a crisis due to cultivators of groundnut, cotton, potato, tomato not getting   (MSP) for their produce, reportedly plans to make a representation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Union government, to pro-actively address the   The Gujarat government also sought information about the government of India’s recent budget announcement to provide an MSP of 1.5 times input cost, to include such a scheme in the state budget as well. After the party’s near rout in rural areas in the 2017 assembly elections, the party has become sensitive to farmers’ issues. The Rupani government is planning a series of actions to address agrarian problems.

 A senior government officer privy to the development said, “The state government has decided to adopt a new scheme for farmers to provide a reasonable MSP, as has been implemented in Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. The Madhya Pradesh government has a ‘Bhavantar’ scheme for farmers, under which farmers get the difference between the market price and MSP directly in their account and they can sell directly at market price. So the government does not need to buy and store it as do today, in the case of groundnut. A lot of government resources will be saved on hiring godowns and using the produce later.”
 
 “The government is also considering a new scheme like in Telangana, where the government provides part of the input cost to farmers before sowing. The third option is a hybrid of the Madhya Pradesh and Telangana models, to suit Gujarat’s needs. The government is waiting for a response from GOI. In case of a delay from GOI, the state government has decided to opt for both the models. We have also contacted Niti Aayog, which is working on a new country-wide formula for MSP,” the source added.
