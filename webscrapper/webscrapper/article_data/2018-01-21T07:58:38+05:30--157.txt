JAMMU: Three people, including an Army jawan, were killed and nine others injured when Pakistan resorted to unprovoked firing along the International Border (IB) and   (LoC) in   region on Saturday. At least 12 people, including three BSF jawans, three Army soldiers and six civilians, have been killed in six ceasefire violations by Pakistan since January 3. 

 "Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked and indiscriminate firing of small arms and automatics on Saturday morning around 0820 hrs in Krishna Ghati sector along the Line of Control," said a defence spokesman, adding that the Indian side retaliated "strongly and effectively". The deceased Army jawan was identified as sepoy Mandeep Singh. "Mandeep Singh, 23, belonged to Alampur village in Punjab's Sangroor district. He is survived by his father Gurnaam Singh," the spokesperson added.
 
 Following the escalation of tension at the border and heavy shelling in Poonch and Rajouri districts, the state government ordered the closure of schools within five km of the IB and LoC. At least 10,000 people living along the border have been shifted to relatively safer areas.
 
 According to defence sources, at least 509 relief camps have been established along IB. The government has announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for the kin of the deceased and Rs 5,000 for the injured. An official said that at least 142 cattle have perished in cross border firing so far.
