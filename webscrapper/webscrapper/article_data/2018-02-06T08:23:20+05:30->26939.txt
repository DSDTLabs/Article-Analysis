HYDERABAD: Requesting strict action against miscreants who allegedly assaulted members of a Christian missionary before setting a carton full of Bibles on fire,   (MIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi wrote a letter to DGP   on Monday.

 The incident reportedly happened on January 24 near   in the   mandal of Nagarkurnool district, and following that, the video was circulated on social media.
 
 “It is our prime concern to maintain religious harmony and peaceful coexistence among different communities of our country. Of late, religious fanaticism is on the rise. There are innumerable incidents where Christians, Dalits and other minorities have been attacked,” he wrote.
 
 “Incidents such as these damage the reputation of our great country in the world,” he added. He also requested the authorities to take strict action against the culprits to ensure such incidents are never repeated and demanded the accused to be produced before the media.
 
 Members of the Christian community along with MIM legislator   later met the DGP and submitted a memorandum to him.
