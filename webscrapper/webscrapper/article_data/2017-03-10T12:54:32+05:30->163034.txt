KOLHAPUR: The women self-help groups can now avail loan under the   scheme for new industrial units and employment generation, said district collector   on International Women’s Day at public gathering in Talsande village.

 “The government has initiated various steps for empowering women. Women are coming forward through various mediums like self-help groups and have entered in sector of self-employment. The self-help groups also have a good track record of loan repayment. The groups in the district have repaid 99% loans taken from banks. If any   wants to start new business or any venture that creates employment, they can avail loan under the Mudra Bank Yojana without guarantee and mortgage,” said Saini.
 
 He added, “Women have 30% reservation in horticulture campaign and women self-help groups should actively participate in it. The district administration will also discuss the issue of independent mall for products made by women self-help groups with district with guardian minister  .”
 
 Saini also asked the self-help groups to join hands against feticide. “Feticide is a taint on our society and should be removed. Women’s participation is necessary for strengthening our democracy and the newly-elected women candidates in local elections should work independently.”
 
 Meanwhile, women self-help groups welcomed the district administration’s decision.  , state coordinator of women self-help group, said, “Women need seed capital to start any business, but it requires guarantee and mortgage. Therefore, their families never allow them to go ahead. Now, they could avail loan from banks without any mortgage and guarantee. It will boost the morale of every aspiring women entrepreneur.”
