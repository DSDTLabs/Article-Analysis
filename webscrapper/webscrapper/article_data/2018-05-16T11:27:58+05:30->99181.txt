CHANDRAPUR: A leopardess injured by a speeding vehicle on   in Lohara forest on Monday was rescued after hours-long rescue operation on Tuesday afternoon. The beast, despite being critically injured, attacked RFO,   range,  , who coolly fended off the charge, before the animal was tranquillized and captured.

 The female leopard had been rammed by an unidentified speeding vehicle in Lohara forest while crossing the road on Monday evening. As foresters could not trace the injured beast on Monday evening, a search operation was taken up on Tuesday morning. After several hours of hunt in the forest, the injured leopardess was tracked to a spot underneath shrubs in FDCM Lohara range. Rescue workers comprising teams from Chandrapur range, FDCM Lohara range,  , and volunteers of NGO Eco-Pro surrounded the beast. They were planning to trap it in a net, when it suddenly charged at RFO Thipe, who was leading his team from one side. 
 
 “The beast was very angry, but I stood my ground and fended off his attacks with the shield. Although I had a baton, I did not hit the leopardess since it was already injured. Soon, the injured beast got exhausted and gave up,” said RFO Thipe. He escaped with minor scratches inflicted by the leopard’s nails. A video clip showing the leopard charge and Thipe fending it off with the shield has gone viral.
 
 Experts said it was very brave of Thipe to face the leopard and not hit it with the baton. If he had panicked and fled, the beast could have broken his neck, experts said.
 
 After the charge on Thipe, rescue workers took no further chances and tranquillized the leopard. Sources said the injured leopardess was taken for treatment to transit treatment centre for wildlife here, and would be moved to   zoo late in the night.
