Nagpur: Vasudev Kapgate, in his 20s, was burned alive after an oil tanker rolled into an adjoining field from the National highway number seven near Jamtha T-point after ramming into another heavy vehicle from behind on Tuesday. The driver of the vehicle, Santosh Marbate, along with conductor Vicky Dhurve managed to flee from the ill-fated vehicle after it caught fire. The oil tanker (MH31 DS 0076) of Bharat petroleum corporation limited (BPCL) was heading towards Mansar when the incident took place. The tanker had filled in around 10,000 litres of petrol and another 10,000 litres of diesel from the BPCL depot at Borkhedi. It is learnt that Kapgate, who, too, was heading to Mansar, had sought for a hitch hike from the driver. Kapgate worked at a petrol pump near Amla phata.  Police said, the tanker driver Marbate lost control over the vehicle after having collided with another similar vehicle moving ahead. The tanker turned turtle before rolling into the field. The cops were soon alerted after the accident.  An officer of Hingna police station said Kapgate was trapped inside the cabin where he was present besides Marbate and Dhurve. While Marbate and Dhurve made an escape from the vehicle which had turned into a blazing inferno soon as the accident took place, Kapgate could not move out of the damaged cabin. An eyewitness claimed that Kapgate had turned into a charcoal with bones left behind the ashes.  The fire brigade was summoned by the cops which doused the fire in some time. A senior officer said there could have been a bigger explosion had the fuel in the tanker come in contact with the flames. An offence against the driver is likely to be registered at Hingna police station for his rash and negligent driving leading to the accident.
