PUNE: Citizens commuting on   and Warje can expect some respite from   with the   ( ) planning to complete the Karvenagar flyover by June.

 After slow progress of the flyover works at Warje, PMC had served notice to the contractor in April 2016. The administration had asked to speed up works or face severe action.
 
 A delegation of local corporators and civic officials visited the site on Saturday. They inspected the pending projects in Warje. They also evaluated the works at Warje water works, Javalkar Garden, Bhalekar Garden and the encroachments in Karvenagar. “The contractors have been instructed to increase the speed of work. We hope to complete the flyover in the next couple of months. It should be open for public use by June 15,” PMC commissioner  , said.
 
 The flyover stretches from Cummins College Chowk to Universal Chowk on Karve Road. Work on the flyover started in 2012 and was supposed to be completed by the end of 2015. Later, the administration expected it to be complete last year. However, it remains incomplete so far.
 
 It is an important junction and the flyover is expected to reduce traffic on Karve Road and in Warje areas. Commuters from Kothrud, Warje, Malwadi, Karve nagar, Dhayari, Sinhagad Road and Mumbai Pune highway can benefit from this facility. Relief can be expected in traffic on this busy road, which has educational institutes nearby.
 
 The delay prompted political parties, including the Nationalist Congress Party, to stage agitations last year to demand speeding up of the works.
 
 According to the PMC, one of the primary reasons for the delay was the lack of funds. Due to this, the work on the flyover had stopped in 2016. The contractor had demanded more funds to meet the construction requirements. The standing committee had then approved the required funds, following which construction resumed.
