JODHPUR: Seventh   will unfold here on Monday at the Golasni Firing Range. Central and state police teams from 24 states will participate in the six-day long event, which is aimed at bringing teams from different states and Centre together to test their potential, capabilities, precision and preparedness to meet any exigency.

 Each team will have 22 members with two in reserve. DGP (Rajasthan)   will inaugurate the event on Monday while home minister   will be the chief guest of the concluding ceremony. 
 
 The event will also have a dog show comprising the foreign breed Belgian Malinous and a motorcycle show, wherein the police commandos will showcase some daredevil acts on motor cycles.
