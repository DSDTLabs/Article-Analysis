AJMER: The   (RBSE) is doing a final checking of   which are likely to be declared on Monday. The board is ensuring that there is no irregularity in the result sheet.

 Double checking of Class XII commerce and science results is being done, sources said. 
 
 “If possible, RBSE will declare the result of all three streams of Class XII together,” said an official source. 
 
 But declaring result of   together is more likely. 
 
 The board will declare the result of Class X board in the last or second last week of May.
 
 Last year, the result of Class XII science and commerce was declared on May 17. The result of Class XII science was 88.53% whereas for commerce it was 88.61%. This time, the announcement of the result will differ as there will be no merit list in any board exam.
