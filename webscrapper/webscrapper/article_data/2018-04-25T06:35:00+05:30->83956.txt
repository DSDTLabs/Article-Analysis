Siliguri: Two Volvo buses with 52 passengers from three countries under the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) Motor Vehicle Agreement reached Siliguri from Dhaka on a trial run on Tuesday afternoon.

 The buses will leave for Nepal on Wednesday after a ceremonial flagoff here at Uttarkanya. They will be received at Panitanki — the Indo-Nepal border — by SSB.
 
 The trial run for passenger vehicles is being conducted on the Dhaka-Kathmandu route via Siliguri under the BBIN MVA signed on June 15, 2015 at the BBIN transport ministers’ meeting in Thimpu. Earlier, the trial run was conducted on the Delhi-Dhaka route. 
 
 The agreement has been ratified by India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Bhutan has not yet ratified it. The three countries are set to start regular   services after signi-ng a passenger protocol that is likely to be signed in Kathmandu after the trial run.
 
 On Tuesday, two buses that were flagged off from Dhaka entered Siliguri through Fulbari along the Indo-Bangla border. A ceremony was organized to welcome the buses with passengers from Bangladesh, Nepal and India. Among the passengers was Binod Bhattarai of Nepal’s foreign ministry.
 
 Bengal tourism minister Goutam Deb said: “The development will further strengthen the close tie-up between the three nations.”
