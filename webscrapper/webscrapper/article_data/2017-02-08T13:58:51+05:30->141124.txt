PATNA: ISI agent and Nepal citizen  , who has been arrested in Kathmandu, revealed about another   3km from Nakardei Halt between Adapur and Raxaul in Bihar on November 2, 2016. It happened after the failed attempt near   on October 1 last year. Both places are in East Champaran and near the Indo-Nepal border.
 
  Though the government rail police (GRP) and railway protection force (RPF) personnel, along with the railway employees, visited the Nakardei Halt on November 3, they did not find anything blast-like. Instead of lodging an FIR or reporting the incident to their seniors, the officials prepared a joint report and declared it a rumour after maintaining a station diary at Raxaul GRP station.
  
  TOI has the photograph of the blast site in which a small crater is visible below the railway track and the stones there are seen yellow-brown in colour. Unlike Ghorasahan, explosion did take place near Nakardei, but did not cause any damage to the railway track.
  
  “According to Huda, Deepak Ram (18) and Arun Ram (27), who failed to detonate the cooker bomb at Ghorasahan, triggered the blast at Nakardei, but it was low-intensity explosion which did not damage the track,” Nepal police inspector Arun Kumar Kushwaha told TOI on phone. Kushwaha is the investigating officer is Deepak and Arun’s murder case and is also interrogating Huda in the case. Both Arun and Deepak were found dead in Bara district of Nepal on December 28 last year.
  
  “It was the second consecutive failure which infuriated Huda, who asked Brajkishore Giri and others to kill Deepak and Arun and send a video clip of the killing to him,” Kushwaha said, adding that Huda had offered more than Rs2 crore to Giri for carrying out the blasts on the railway tracks and public places in India.
