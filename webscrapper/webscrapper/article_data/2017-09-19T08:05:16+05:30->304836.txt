ALAPPUZHA: S  , a priest belonging to the   community, who was not allowed to join duty as kizh shanti (sub-priest) at the   temple, on Monday submitted a letter to the   (TDB) stating that disallowing him on the basis of caste would be violation of Supreme Court judgment. The 36-year-old was transferred from Puthiyidam Sree Krishna Swamy temple to Chettikulangara Devi temple under the TDB by the Mavelikkara assistant commissioner on June 19, 2017. However, the temple administrative committee moved the high court against the appointment of Sudhikumar. The high court directed the TDB commissioner C P Ramaraja Prema Prasad to take a final decision after a hearing. The TDB commissioner conducted a hearing on August 7, 2017 and quashed the transfer order on August 10.

 According to Sudhikumar, the temple's thanthri informed the devaswom commissioner that only Malayalee   can be appointed as priests at Chettikulangara temple. “I am from Ezhava caste and he told me if I perform poojas, devi will turn angry. I felt humiliated when they denied me the job in the name of my caste. It is my desire to perform poojas in the temple,'' he said.
 
 According to the administra tive committee, the temple has three sub-priests and one chief priest. “It is the responsibility of the sub-priests to conduct `para' ritual. The temple has a rich legacy and the rituals are several centuries old,“ a committee member said.
 
 Normally the sub-priests of the temple are from Brahmin community .
 
 “We are not against him. But we are not sure if he knows all the rituals related to `para'. If TDB authorities can give an assurance on this we will not have any objection against his appointment,'' a committee member said.
 
 TDB president Prayar Gopalakrishnan said the board is yet to receive any complaint from Sudhikumar. “He has submitted a letter to the board on Monday . The board will consider his letter on Tuesday or Wednesday and take a final decision,'' he said.
