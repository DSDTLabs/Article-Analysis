LUDHIANA: Asked to provide identification proof in order to stay at a room inside the cremation ground, a man alleged murdered a 70-year-old member of   at Ramgarh Sardara village of Malaud in Payal tehsil on Thursday.

 The deceased, identified as  , was killed with a sharp-edged weapon when he had gone for his morning walk. The accused, identified as   (52), stabbed him a couple of times.
 
 The accused was arrested after Karnail’s nephew saw him and raised an alarm.
 
 The police have booked Mahto, who hails from Bihar, under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC. The police have also recovered the weapon used in the murder.
 
 According to information, Mahto came to the village two months ago and started living in a vacant room built inside the cremation ground without the consent of villagers, and the gurdwara committee members objected to it.
 
 ASI Nichhatar Singh from Malaud police station said Kailash was an outsider and he occupied the room without the consent of villagers or panchayat or the gurdwara committee (which approached him to know his background).
 
 The ASI said Karnail Singh had asked Mahto to produce his identification proof, so that they could get his police verification done. Mahto agreed to produce the documents, but asked for some time saying he had to bring the same from his native place. But in reality, Mahto nurtured animosity against Karnail Singh, the ASI said.
 
 The official said a few days ago, Karnail asked him to produce the documents, after which Kailash decided to kill him, as he thought the former did not want him to live there.
 
 On Thursday morning, when the elderly man was walking towards his house, the accused attacked him with a sharp-edged weapon. Meanwhile, Karnail’s nephew   heard the screams of his uncle, raised an alarm, and rushed him to a nearly hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries two hours later.
 
 The ASI said the police were checking the background of the accused.
