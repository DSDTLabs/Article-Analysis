Mumbai: It was a close shave for 15 students from  , Goregaon (east), after the   of their   failed on their way home on Wednesday afternoon. The bus   averted a   by directing the vehicle towards the footpath near Oberoi Mall and coming to a halt against a tree.

 The driver, Kisan Gaikwad, who has worked at the school since 2003, said he was ferrying 15 students from Class I to IX around 2 pm when the problem occurred at the signal opposite the mall. “Some four days ago, the brakes were giving us trouble but a mechanic came and worked on it,” he said. Gaikwad said he had to think quickly and realized that there were no pedestrians on the footpath or cars parked by the side. “So I decided to take the bus there and that is how it hit the tree. As we were near a signal, the bus was at a speed of less than 20 kmph,” he said.
 
 Two officers from the Dindoshi police station visited the spot. “The bus wasn’t there when we reached. We made inquiries and recorded the two statements. The bus driver seems to have had a close shave. The brakes failed and the driver had the presence of mind to move the vehicle near the pavement. This saved the lives of the students on the bus,” an officer said. 
 
 The police said the bus was going slowly. “No case has been registered,” said the officer. 
 
 While school COO Neti Srinivasan did not respond to calls or texts, a school official said the children were unhurt and a replacement bus was sent immediately.
