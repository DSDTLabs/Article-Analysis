CUTTACK: A   park will be inaugurated at the   here on January 23, the birth anniversary of Netaji  . 

 At least 25 varieties of rare ferns will come up on 500 sq ft of land on the museum premises. Authorities will procure these plants from the Regional Plant Resource Centre, Bhubaneswar.
 
 "Fern plants are considered good air purifiers. Netaji was a nature lover and he has also mentioned in his autobiography that he loved gardening. On the occasion of his birth anniversary every year, we try to add some new sections to his garden," said museum curator  
 
 Around Rs 20,000 will be spent on the project. The museum garden already has special orchid and rose sections. "The house, where Netaji spent his early childhood, was converted into a museum in 2004. The house sprawls over an acre and almost two-thirds of the area has been dedicated to the garden," said Das.
 
 A musical fountain will also be built by Idco on the museum premises at the cost of Rs 48 lakh.
 
 "Tenders have already been floated and work on the project will start soon," said deputy director of the culture department Sanghamitra Satpathy.
