HYDERABAD: Two years since   was launched, the government intends to keep up the pace of the programme even as it seeks a debate on the need to switch over to less water-intensive crops, irrigation minister   said on Sunday. 

 Speaking at a seminar on ‘Water conservation - Social responsibility’ in the city, the minister said the success of the programme has been due to the participation of the people. But a debate on crop selection and cropping pattern also ought to happen, he said.   produces more rice than it requires and it is time to discuss whether paddy should continue to be one of the primary crops in the state. Growing one kilo of rice requires 4,000 litres water. “We need to think about our reliance on water intensive crops and consider other crops that need less water but bring better returns to farmers,” he said.
 
 The minister also hinted at the need to review some of the laws regulating river water sharing between states. Long drawn procedural formalities in getting agreements from the riparian states only result in delays and increased project costs, he said. He said that the state has plans to store water from   and save a portion of it that goes into the sea in order to improve agriculture, fisheries and ecological health of the land.
 
 The first two phases of Mission Kakatiya, which was launched on March 12, 2015, resulted in irrigation of 15.80 lakh acres in the state over two crop seasons. This was possible with the increased storage capacity of village tanks and lakes after desilting of the water bodies. This also played a crucial role in recharging the ground water table, he said.
 
 To mark two years of Mission Kakatiya, a ‘walk for water’ will be held on March 22 as part of  , a celebration of water conservation .
