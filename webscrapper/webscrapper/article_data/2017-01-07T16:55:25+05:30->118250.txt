PANAJI: Discontent brewing within the   Committee spilled out in to the open on Saturday when state party president  , known for his careful if not vague answers, took potshots at his own party members. Barely weeks ahead of the February 4 state assembly polls, the idea of an alliance has split the party into two factions.

 Addressing a press conference on Saturday at the party office, Faleiro took pains to assert that his main goal was to build the party and to promote new leaders while avoiding the corrupt practices of the past that led to the party’s downfall in the 2012 elections.
 
 “If at all I have come back it is to build the Congress party. I tried to build new faces,” Faleiro said.
 
 Several Congress MLAs including former chief minister Digambar Kamat recently flew to Delhi to convince the party’s central leadership to accept the proposal of a pre-poll alliance with Goa Forward and possibly the NCP too.
 
 When prodded repeatedly on the calls for a pre-poll alliance from party MLAs, an idea that he has always rejected, Faleiro said, “For the last five years these so called leaders did not have time to come to this office. I am happy that I have succeeded in helping them to go on a pilgrimage to Delhi. Some Congress senior leaders don’t have time to come to the party office but they have time and money to go Delhi.”
