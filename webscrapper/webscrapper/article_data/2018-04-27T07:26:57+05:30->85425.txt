HYDERABAD: The   on Thursday sought to know safeguards available to those ‘inconvenient’ MLAs in the event the party in power decides to remove them from their legislator posts by passing a House resolution. The bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice K   posed the question to CS Vaidyanathan, who is representing 12 TRS MLAs opposing relief given by a single-judge bench to expelled   MLAs Komatireddy   and SA  .

 The single-judge bench had revoked the expulsions effected by the Telangana Assembly. While making it clear that the poser has nothing to do with the case, the bench said it needs an answer to the query because the rights and privileges of legislators were still undefined in India. The expelled MLAs too contended the Assembly has no power to expel them.
 
 Quoting the Supreme Court judgment in the Raja Ram Pal case, Vaidyanathan said the House has power to expel unruly members. “The Assembly can launch an inquiry against a legislator if he displays a conduct that is unbecoming of a legislator outside the House. But if he displays the same conduct in the House, then there is no need for an inquiry. The requirements of following principles of natural justice like issuing notices and seeking explanations too need not be followed. The House can straight away resolve to expel such a legislator,” he explained.
 
 The two legislators themselves admitted they were unruly and violent and in fact one of them threw the microphone towards the governor, he said. The bench sought to know why the House expelled the two legislators when only one of them threw the microphone. He stated the punishment was for undue conduct of the two and their obstructive actions.
 
 Earlier, the bench pulled up  , the counsel for Venkat Reddy, for his professional misconduct. Hearing would continue on Friday.
