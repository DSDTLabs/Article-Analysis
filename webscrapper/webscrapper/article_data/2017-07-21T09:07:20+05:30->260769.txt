 Talking to journalists while returning from Delhi on Thursday evening he claimed that he did not know anything about the cross-voting in the presidential poll. “Earlier, we had done a mock voting of all the 57 MLAs and explained to them how to vote. Somebody may have some grievances and voted against the party candidate. However, as voting is private, it’s difficult to determine who cross-voted. I will try to find out. I 100% voted for our candidate, Meira Kumarji,” Vaghela said.
