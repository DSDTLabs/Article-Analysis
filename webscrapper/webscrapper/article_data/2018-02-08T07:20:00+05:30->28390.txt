Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday granted bail to Ashish Kumar, the friend of Haryana BJP president Subhash Baralaâ€™s son Vikas Barala, in the Varnika Kundu  .

 Ashish was behind bars since August 9, 2017. He had applied for bail after the high court on January 11 granted bail to Vikas Barala, the main accused. Justice Lisa Gill, while granting bail to Ashish, observed no useful purpose would be served by keeping the petitioner incarcerated any longer in the present facts and circumstances of the case. The high court, however, made it clear the petitioner will not directly or indirectly try to contact the complainant, any of her family members or witnesses, or else it may lead to cancellation of his bail.
 
 The counsel for the petitioner had argued the petitioner has been in custody for around six months. It was further stated he himself had surrendered and extended complete cooperation in the investigation.
 
 On August 5, Ashish and Vikas Barala had allegedly followed Varnika, the daughter of a senior Haryana bureaucrat, and tried to stop her car. The girl called the Chandigarh Police, which apprehended the boys. At the time of incident, they were under the influence of liquor. Both were booked under Section 354 D (stalking) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under provisions of Motor Vehicles Act. Later, the police had added two more Sections for attempt to kidnaping and re-arrested them.
