PUNE: Two men died and two others were injured when a speeding pick-up van rammed a truck parked on the service lane of the Pune-Mumbai expressway on Tuesday night at Kamshet, nearly 45km from here. 

 The victims were busy replacing a deflated tyre of the truck when the van crashed into the heavy vehicle. After the accident, the van driver reversed his vehicle to move out of the truck’s rear side and fled the spot. 
 
 The occupant of another car passing by, however, noted down the registration number of the pick-up van and shared it with the police. A police team traced the van to Urali Kanchan on Pune-Solapur highway and detained its driver.
 
 The Kamshet police identified the deceased as Abhijit Mahadev Avale (28) and Santosh Dattatray Devkate (25), both residents of Mohol in Solapur district. Vikas Balasaheb Dhere (23) of Mohol in Solapur and Mohammed Nisar (21), who’s originally from Bihar, have been admitted to a private hospital in Nigdi. Their condition is stable. 
 
 The police said the truck, loaded with goods, was moving towards Pune from Mumbai on its way to Solapur. A tyre of the truck deflated at a spot in front of the Pavana police outpost. After the driver brought the truck on the service lane, the four persons in it alighted and started replacing the tyre. It was then the van rammed the truck from rear. All the victims were caught between the truck and the van, the police said.
 
 The Kamshet police have registered a case of rash and negligent driving against the tempo driver.
 
 A similar accident had occurred at Devale village near Lonavla on Monday when a vehicle ran over a man helping a car driver replace a deflated tyre.
