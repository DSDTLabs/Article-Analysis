PATNA:  , the seventh   of the country, will   in a   this year. This was decided at a meeting of university officials,   and principals of colleges on Saturday.

 The meeting, chaired by vice-chancellor Sudhir Kumar Srivastava, decided that each post-graduate department of the university would organise at least one international seminar or conference this year. The university would approach various funding agencies like the UGC and the state government and also its alumni occupying important positions to mobilise necessary funds for organising conferences.
 
 To initiate the celebrations, two lectures on the history of growth and development of PU by eminent alumni would be organised on April 20. A souvenir depicting important facets of university life and some remarkable achievements of PU will also be brought out on the occasion. “A centenary celebration committee would be constituted for conceptualizing various events during the centenary year,” said the VC.
 
 The centenary year of PU commenced on October 1 last year, but no programme could be organized to commemorate the occasion. The then VC, Y C Simhadri, had approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inaugurate the celebrations, but it did not materialize. He then postponed the celebrations for an indefinite period.
 
 Consequently, all the programmes planned for the inaugural day function of the year-long celebrations, including an exhibition of rare and valuable documents and photographs relating to the establishment and growth of PU and a variety cultural programmes, were also postponed.
 
 PU academics had expressed grave concern over the reported casual attitude of the university authorities towards centenary celebrations of PU which has guided the shape of development of higher education in the eastern region of the country.
