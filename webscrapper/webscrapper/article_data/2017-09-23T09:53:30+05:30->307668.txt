RANCHI: Demonetisation and the Goods and   (GST) have emerged as two demons for Durga Puja committees in Ranchi this year.

 While the roll out of GST in July has led to an increase in the price of puja materials, on the other hand, puja committees are struggling to manage their expenses as donors, who contributed lakhs of rupees until last year, have refused to do the same this time for fear of coming under probing agencies.
 
 The Railway Station Puja Committee draws a huge crowd to their pandal every year. This year, the pandal theme revolves around the Odiya architecture. The overall budget has been pegged at Rs 40 lakh. "We are struggling with the prices of raw materials. A truck filled with thermocol sheet for decoration costed us Rs 40,000," president of the committee Munchun Rai said.
 
 Puja committees who have maintained a small budget are also feeling the heat of GST. The Deshapriya Club and Library puja committee decided upon a budget of Rs 3 lakh. Committee president Ashim Nashkar said, "Last week, we purchased dhotis and sarees for dressing the idols. We had to pay Rs 10,000 as GST."
 
 Besides GST, the puja committees have also been stung by the note ban which was implemented last year. A senior functionary of   in   said, "Till last year, we received good amount of donations from politicians and businessmen. This year, they have refused to donate due to fear of coming under the scanner."
 
 The   in Ratu Road has decided to reduce its grandeur as coporate sponsors have refused to pitch in. "The puja budget for 2016 was Rs 55 lakh. We have only managed to collect 50% of the amount from sponsors," Vicky Yadav, one of the members of the committee, said.
 
 Yadav added, "The decoration and lighting have been scaled down due to limited budget."
