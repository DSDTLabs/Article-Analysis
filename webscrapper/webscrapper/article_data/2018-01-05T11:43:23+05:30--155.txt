NAINITAL: In what is being seen as an unprecedented step, the   has decided to “boycott” a sitting judge, claiming that he has “misbehaved with lawyers”. The association, which has 800 lawyers as its members, took this decision in a general body meeting on Thursday.
 
  Nadeem Moon, president of the association, told TOI, “The honourable judge makes personal comments about lawyers in an open   which can be quite insulting for the latter. We are hurt and have passed a resolution to boycott his courtroom. We have also sought his transfer.”
  
  In the meeting, the association also suspended the membership of seven lawyers and severed them notices for not voting in favour of the resolution. Ajay Veer Pundir, one of the lawyers who had to face action, said, “I had no knowledge of this resolution. Also, no one can stop an advocate from representing his client in the court, or else it will be violation of the Advocates Act, 1961.”
