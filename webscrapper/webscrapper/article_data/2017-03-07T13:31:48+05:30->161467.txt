The list of celebs who've been threatened on Twitter, just keeps getting bigger. And after receiving   ranging from 'You need to be raped', to 'I'll throw acid on your face' and 'I'll make sure you never sing again', singer   has filed an online   demanding that the social media platform shutdown all accounts that have Tweeted rape threats. On bringing the threats she received to  's notice, she was told that action could be taken only if there was a police case. So she filed a police complaint and got three abusers arrested. 
But realising that this was not a permanent solution to these threats, the singer came up with a petition that read, "It is the responsibility of Twitter to ensure that their platform is not used for promoting violence against women." She hopes that this petition, that has been signed by over 15,000 people, will lead to Twitter shutting down accounts that promote violence against women, just as they shut down accounts that are linked to terrorism.
