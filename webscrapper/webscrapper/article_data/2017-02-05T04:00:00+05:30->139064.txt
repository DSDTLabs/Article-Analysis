Vadodara: Whenever domestic flights get delayed or there is a change in flight schedule, an SMS, an email or a voice-call lands promptly on passenger’s phone. The passenger is informed about the changed timings to avoid any inconvenience. But not many know that the software that automatically informs airline passengers about the flight delays, advisories and changed timings has been developed by a city-based software firm.  Phoneon.in that was started by Ujwal Makhija now caters to six major airlines providing domestic flight services. “Vistara recently implemented our Unified Communication System (UCS) for automation of its flight-related notifications. If any of its flight gets delayed, the passenger will be informed well in time about the changed timings. It will help the airline in providing hassle-free travel experience to its passengers,” Makhija, CEO of Phoneon.in told TOI.  Asked why he thought of making a software for airlines, Makhija said, “I realized that earlier the airlines didn’t have much focus on customers and they won’t invest much in making such a software. I thought of creating this software to prevent inconvenience to passengers who often learnt about the delayed flights only after they had reached the airport. And we began catering to the airlines about six years ago.”  Makhija added that their software now caters to 65 per cent of domestic flight passengers in the country.  Makhija had graduated from M S University’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering before studying at IIM-Calcutta. He decided to return to the city and launched Phoneon.in in 2006. “We also cater to top travel portals and banks in the country. My wife Pooja joined my firm few years ago and we now have 50 employees,” Makhija said.
