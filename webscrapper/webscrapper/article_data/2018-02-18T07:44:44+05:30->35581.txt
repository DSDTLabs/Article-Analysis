BENGALURU/MANDYA: Chief minister   on Saturday said Karnataka will oppose the setting up of the   management board as stipulated by the Supreme Court. 

  The SC in its orders on Friday, while reallocating the share of Cauvery waters between the riparian states, had directed the Centre to constitute the board within six weeks. Karnataka has been against the board as it would mean the state losing control of the reservoirs and dams that come under the Cauvery basin. 
 
 Meanwhile, the   Zilla Raitha Hitarakshna Samithi, which is spearheading the Cauvery issue, met in Mandya and said that the board would be detrimental to Karnataka's interest. "Setting up of the board would mean surrendering our custodial rights over our reservoirs to the Centre. We will be reduced to beggars for our own water, we must resist the board,'' the office-bearers said.
 
  The Samithi said if the board has to be constituted, it should be headed by former prime minister  . They took exception to actor  's statement asking TN government to file a review petition on the SC scaling down that state's share. 
 
 "Rajnikant, being a Kannadiga, ought not to have made such illogical and partisan comments over apex court's rulings. He must not forget his past life as Kannadiga,'' they added.
