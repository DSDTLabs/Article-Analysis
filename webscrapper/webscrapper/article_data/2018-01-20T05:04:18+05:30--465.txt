Prernaa Arora, the co-producer of   movie 'PadMan', has hailed  's decision to defer the film's release.

 On Friday evening, Akshay Kumar, together with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, announced the postponement of 'PadMan', so that  's ' ' can get a solo release.
 
 "Akshay's entire team is with him on this decision," his co-producer   of Kriarj Films said.
 
 "What Akshay Sir did on Friday evening is unheard of. Just a week before our film's release, without any prior intimation, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, a legend in his own right, came to Akshay requesting that we postpone 'PadMan'," she said.
 
 "It takes a lot of humility for a man of Bhansali's stature to come forward with such a request. It takes an equally great artiste to agree to such a startling request," Arora said. 
 
 "It was a very unusual request considering we were days away from release. But Akshay agreed immediately. It says a lot about his generous heart," she added.
 
 Prernaa also scoffs at filmmakers and producers who deliberately pitch their films against one another. 
 
 "They should learn from this experience. By moving ahead by two weeks at the last minute, Akshay Sir has shown there can be solidarity in the film fraternity. His gesture will be remembered for a very long time," she said.
 
 The entire 'PadMan' team is with Akshay on this issue.
 
 "We are all in agreement on Akshay Sir's decision. There are so many big stars who deliberately look for box office clashes by pitching their films against other big films. Akshay Sir has shown the way to a peaceful co-existence in the film industry."
