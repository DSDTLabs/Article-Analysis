MADURAI: Apart from sand shortage, the new norms introduced in plan approval of buildings also seem to have complicated matters for the construction industry, especially workers. Apart from big builders, residents constructing their houses in city limits have also been finding it difficult to get through the plan  .

 “The norms have been tightened for building plan approval by the civic body. Hence, many residents are hesitant to take up construction, and this in turn affects thousands of workers depending on the industry for their livelihood”, stated C  , district secretary of Construction Workers Federation of India.
 
 Corporation officials however denied any delay in plan approval since everything was computerised. The challenge was in submitting the correct plan with all checks required for the computer to clear it. Chief town planning officer   said that all building plans submitted for approval were being cleared within 30 days. There was no official delay in sanctioning building approvals, he claimed.
 
 Workers opined that the complications in plan approval could be due to regulation of unapproved housing layouts. Earlier, such layouts also used to be sanctioned after collecting developmental costs which has since been stopped by the state government. Now, the layouts have to be approved by   before the building approval is submitted. “The process has been split into site approval and building approval and there are issues with site approval if the layouts are not approved by LPA”, he added.
