BHUBANESWAR: The Jagatsinghpur district police on Sunday arrested a sharp shooter from Kolkata for his alleged involvement in October 26 murder of   Mahendra Swain at Paradeep. Business baron   is the alleged mastermind of the offence.

 "We arrested the sharp shooter   from Howrah area with the assistance of West Bengal police. We had been tracking his movements since past few weeks. Khan confessed he received Rs 5 lakh cash to engage goons to eliminate Swain," SP (Jagatsinghpur) Jai Narayan Pankaj told TOI. "We will interrogate him and try to find out the person, who paid him the supari," Pankaj said. 
 
 Police said Khan earned the notoriety of camouflaging his identity. "We found he used six names at different places in Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand and committed several crimes in these states. He is more infamous as Ashok Bihari," Pankaj said.
 
 Subhransu Sekhar Nayak, inspector-in-charge of Paradeep police station, said Khan was produced in a court in Howrah and would be brought to Odisha on Monday on transit remand. So far the police arrested 11 persons, including Mahima, who allegedly hired the goons to eliminate Swain over rivalry in stevedoring business at Paradeep port. Swain, general manager of Hyderabad-based Seaways Shipping and Logistics Ltd, was gunned down by four assailants in Paradeep on October, 26 last year. Police arrested Mahima from Bangkok on December 25.
 
 Mahima recently told the media outside the court that he was falsely framed in the case. His lawyers, during hearing of his bail applications last week, told the judge that the police were harassing Mahima by digging out old cases where he was already given clean chit by the probe agency.
