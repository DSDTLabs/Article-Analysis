MUMBAI:   and schools should be concerned about how students travel, said the Bombay   on Monday. The court was hearing a   that sought action against autorickshaws and light motor vehicles operating as school transport to ferry children. “Every parent and every school must be worried about how children travel. Every child’s life is precious and parents cannot run away from the responsibility,” the bench of Justice Naresh Patil and Justice Nitin Sambre observed. 

 The court said a blanket ban on autos may not be possible at this stage given the question of affordability as well as socio-economic conditions that forces economically disadvantaged parents from choosing such a mode of transport for their kids. “We often see adults and schoolchildren running behind a moving bus to board it,” remarked Justice Patil. The bench said the state transport department had to be equally vigilant. The bench suggested that the transport department provide a toll-free number so that people could lodge complaints about school buses.
