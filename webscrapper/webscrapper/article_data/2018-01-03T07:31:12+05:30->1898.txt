LUCKNOW: There was some relief from thick   during the day but intense cold continued on Tuesday. Cold conditions and dense fog will continue on Wednesday. However, the state Met department predicted gradual improvement in the situation towards the weekend. Visibility in the morning was better in comparison to Monday as light winds cleared the ground fog. However, the fog, lifted by the wind, formed a dense layer and remained suspended 3-4 km over above the ground.

 There was sunshine but only for a brief period. The wind cleared fog but added to the chill. As a result, maximum   could not rise above 15.5 degrees Celsius, which was six degrees below normal. People were seen lighting bonfires during the day. The minimum temperature in the wee hours dropped to 9.7 degrees Celsius but was two degrees above normal.
 
 
  
 
 State Met director   said the city is witnessing thick fog because of high moisture content in the atmosphere. However, the light winds currently prevailing over Indo-Â¬Gangetic   are strengthening. Also the relative humidity which was more than 80% is decreasing. In such a scenario, density and duration of fog would decrease gradually. The daytime temperatures will increase but night temperatures will be low.
 
 On Wednesday, moderate to dense fog is expected till forenoon and moderate fog during rest of the day. The maximum and minimum temperatures would be around 17 and nine degrees Celsius respectively.
