BENGALURU: There are no plans of using the Kolar Gold Field ( ) as a   for the city’s waste for now, Bengaluru development minister   affirmed to the assembly on Wednesday.

 KGF MLA Y Ramakka queried George about reports of the now defunct gold mines in her constituency being used as Bengaluru’s dumpyard. In his reply, George assured her that the government had not identified land for the dumping the city’s waste.
 
 “The government’s plan is to identify a pocket of land of about 1,000 acres on Bengaluru’s outskirts, where the city’s waste can be disposed of. The responsibility to identify a location best suited for this purpose has been entrusted to the department of forests, environment and ecology,” George added.
 
 Pointing out that the government would mark the boundary of the city’s future landfill with trees, George said, “We are yet to zero in on landfill sites where waste can be disposed of in a scientific manner.”
 
 Speculation surrounding the possibility of KGF turning into Bengaluru’s next landfill raised the hackles of Kolar citizens. On January 31, a day-long bandh was observed at KGF protesting against any such possible moves. Chairman of the Karnataka Compost Development Corporation (KCDC) was reported to have said that Bengaluru’s trash would be dumped near Marikuppam in Bangarpet taluk of Kolar district.
