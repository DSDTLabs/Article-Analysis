Actress   shot to fame with her stint as Anandi of   and there has been no looking back for her.
 The actress, who will be seen in the religious show  , will essay the vital role of Baijama. Toral says initially she wasnâ€™t sure of portraying a real character.
  
  "It is a real character that I have to bring alive on-screen. When I was given a briefing of the character by the creative team, I wasn't sure of playing it. But there is something about this role that made me give my nod in acceptance," said Toral at the launch of the show.
  
  The character has earlier been essayed by Kishori Shahane in the iconic movie Sai Baba that starred   in the role of the divine Sai.
  
  Ask her of the instant comparisons that she may have to face considering Kishori had carved a niche for herself with this role, and Toral has just the right reply.
  
  "Comparisons are natural. The way Kishoriji essayed the role was her style, my way will be different but keeping in mind not to take away the originality of the character. Also, people do want freshness on board. I agree whenever you name Sai Baba, Baijama and others, one instantly is reminded of the actors who played them on-screen. But I will try my best to do justice to this role."
  
  This year marks the 100-year completion of a momentous event of Sai Baba taking Samadhi in Shirdi and owing to this, the show Mere Sai has been conceptualized.
  The show stars actors Abeer Soofi as Sai Baba, Vaibhav Mangle as Kulkarni Sarkar, Abhishek Nigam as younger Sai Baba, Chirag Dave as Mhalsapati and Hemant Thatte as Appa Kote Patil along with other supporting cast.
