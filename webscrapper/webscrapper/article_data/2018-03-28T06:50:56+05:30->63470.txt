ALLAHABAD: The Board of Revenue, Allahabad, on Tuesday rejected the objections raised by former UP cabinet minister   regarding a dispute over allowing inclusion of 'chak' roads in the land of   in   by the commissioner and gave direction to proceed with the petition filed the district magistrate in this matter. 

 Rampur DM had filed a petition seeking initiation of case against Azam Khan for alleged illegal occupation of 'chak' roads into Jauhar University campus. Azam Khan had raised objections on the petition. 
 
 After hearing both sides, member, Board of Revenue, rejected the objections of Azam Khan and directed to proceed with the matter relating to the case filed by district magistrate, Rampur.
 
 It said that some ‘chak’ roads (roads used by villagers) were coming within the huge land allocated for Jauhar University of Azam Khan.
 
 It is alleged that when Azam Khan was cabinet minister, from 2007 to 2012, the commissioner of Moradabad division permitted inclusion of these ‘chak’ roads within Jauhar University. On October 23, 2017, however, DM Rampur moved a petition before the Board of Revenue, seeking permission to initiate a case, as according to him the commissioner had improperly granted permission for the inclusion of ‘chak’ roads within Jauhar University, an institution owned by Azam Khan’s family-owned trust. The petition said that as per rules, ‘chak’ roads cannot be merged as they are used by villagers. Azam Khan had filed objections against the petition of DM, Rampur stating that the petition is time barred.
