BENGALURU: The high court dismissed a writ appeal filed by the proprietor of a convention hall in Bengaluru North taluk, citing that he had developed the property without obtaining permission from the Bengaluru Mysuru Infrastructure Corridor Area Planning Authority (BMICAPA). 

 "Development of the property by the petitioner without the planning authority's written permission has rightly entailed issuance of the notice in question," a division bench of Justices H G   and P S   observed. It dismissed the appeal filed by  , proprietor of   at Madavara, Dasanapura.
 
 On May 13, 2015, BMICAPA issued the notice to Krishnegowda, seeking removal of the convention hall citing violation of provisions of   and Country Planning (KTCP) Act, 1961. "The air-conditioned convention hall spread over 9,923 square feet appears to be no less in standard than a permanent building constructed on a well-laid foundation," the bench noted, while upholding the single-judge bench's order dismissing his petition.
 
 Krishnegowda had challenged the single-bench order in a writ appeal before the division bench, contending that the convention hall is a temporary structure and after taking the land on lease, he had utilized it to erect the structure for holding marriages and corporate events.
