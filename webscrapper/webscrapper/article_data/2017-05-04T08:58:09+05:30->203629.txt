BHUBANESWAR: The economic offence wing (EOW) of state Crime Branch on Wednesday arrested a lady entrepreneur on charges of availing loans of Rs 1.24 crore from a private bank here in 2013 by submitting a forged document. The accused  , 36, owns a restaurant, hotel and biofuel plant in Cuttack, EOW sources said.

 “We are also looking for her husband  , an electrical engineer in a city in Saudi Arabia. Requisite legal procedures will be followed for his arrest. The couple availed Rs 1.24 crore home loans in three phases from ICICI bank’s Cuttack Road branch in Bhubaneswar by furnishing a forged sale deed of a house,” special director general (crime) B K Sharma told TOI. EOW said Debabrata has been working in the gulf nation for past five years. 
 
 Last month, the bank’s area manager Susant Kumar Nayak lodged a complaint with EOW against the couple, who belonged to Charbatia area in Cuttack. According to the complaint, the couple approached the bank in October 2013, seeking home loan of Rs 38 lakh to purchase a duplex from one Puspalata Choudhury in Bhubaneswar. 
 
 “During process of the loan’s clearance, the couple produced Puspalata and another woman identified as Anita Routray in the bank by introducing them as the owners of the duplex. The bank subsequently passed the loan. Later the bank came to know that the two women were impersonators and they produced forged sale deed of the duplex,” Sharma said. After clearance of the Rs 38 lakh loan, the couple availed Rs 33 lakh and Rs 53 lakh home loans by producing the same forged document. 
 
 EOW sources said the couple paid EMI to the bank for a few months and later became defaulters. The bank came to know about the fraud only when the couple stopped paying the EMI. “We also suspect the collusion of some bank officials behind the offence. They should have properly verified the documents before granting the loans. We are also trying to locate the two women, who impersonated as owners of the duplex,” Sharma said.
