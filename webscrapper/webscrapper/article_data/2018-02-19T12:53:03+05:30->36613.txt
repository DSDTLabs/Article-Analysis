NEW DELHI: Australian batsman   is quite chuffed at being named as one of the candidates   [IPL] franchise   are considering to take over the reins of the team for the upcoming season. The captaincy spot is vacant after   returned to   at the IPL auction last month.

 
 KKR broke the bank to secure the services of Lynn when they bought him for a jaw-dropping Rs 9.6 crore in January, becoming the costliest Australian at the auction. Recently, KKR coach Jacques Kallis told PTI that Lynn is one of their top picks for the captaincy role.
 
 At the Big Bash League 2017-18, though he played just five matches for Brisbane Heats, he was a solid performer scoring 148 runs with a best of 63 not out and strike-rate of 162.63.
 
 "I'd love to, I'd jump at the opportunity," the Lynn was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au on Monday. "We've got a really good group at Kolkata. The coaching staff, Simon Katich, Jacques Kallis, Heath Streak … I can relate [easily to] them."
 
  will be Lynn's fifth season at the cash-rich T20 tournament. Last season, for KKR, he smashed 295 runs at an astronomical strike-rate of 180.98 in just seven appearances. 
 
 Lynn will have two Australians Mitchell Starc and Mitchell Johnson for company at KKR besides IPL veterans in Robin Uthappa, Vinay Kumar, Sunil Narine, Piyush Chawla among others.
 
 The 27-year-old acknowledged he is still gaining experience on the leadership front but won't shy away from the responsibility should it come his way. "…there's a couple of boys that have been in the IPL for 10 years so you can't ignore their experience, especially in their own backyard. I'm still learning the game over there but if given the nod then I'd jump at the chance," he said.
 
 Whoever eventually takes over the captaincy role, will have big shoes to fill in. In his seven-year stint with Kolkata, Gambhir led them to two IPL titles besides scoring 3035 runs in 108 matches.
