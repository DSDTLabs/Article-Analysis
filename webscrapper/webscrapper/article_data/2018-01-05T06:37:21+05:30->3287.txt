KOLKATA: When the   finally chugged into Howrah station, it was nearly 4am on Thursday. The  , which was supposed to start from New Delhi at 4.55pm on Tuesday and reach Howrah at 9.50am on Wednesday, began its journey well past midnight due to a dense fog cover and reached its destination about 16 hours late. And officials don't expect a respite from the fog till after January 15. 

 "The situation is critical. The fog in the   section is so dense that even high-speed trains like Rajdhanis are unable to move at speeds over 10 km/hr along certain stretches. Most passengers are reaching the stations well in advance and are being forced to spend long hours in the trains. In some cases, toilets run out of water and the pantry runs out of food," said a senior railway official.
 
 After it started from Delhi, the train took nearly 15 hours to travel 440km to reach Kanpur, a distance normally covered in five hours. 
 
 The Howrah-bound Rajdhani scheduled to depart New Delhi on Wednesday evening started at 2.15am on Thursday and at 5.50pm, it had just crossed Kanpur. The Sealdah-bound train was close behind. Unless things improve, the trains will reach their destinations only on Friday morning. The   that started from Howrah on Wednesday reached the station after 9pm on Thursday. 
 
 "We are unable to cancel trains since so many people are involved and the   would get totally cut-off. But with trains getting delayed, the schedules will remain chaotic for several more days," the official added.
