NEW DELHI:   did a complete 180-degree as it swung from the Left to the Right in assembly election 2018. One of CPM's last-standing bastions fell to the  's onslaught, as Tripura pressed the button for a 'Modi Sarkar' and ended the 20-year reign of  .

 
 Dubbed India's "poorest chief minister", Manik Sarkar does not have a personal car, any investments or assets and as of January 20, his bank balance is a meagre Rs 2,410. He does not use a mobile phone or an email account and is not active on social media. 
 
 According to an affidavit submitted from his   constituency for the February 18 assembly polls, the 69-year-old CPM leader possesses inherited land measuring 0.0118 acres in Krishnanagar, on the outskirts of  , jointly with his lone sister. 
 
 Sarkar donates his entire salary and earnings to his party while accepting a small stipend in return. He has never filed an income tax return as his earnings are too paltry to declare.
 
 Sarkar's honest image and simple lifestyle continues to resonate with the people of the state: he is leading in the Dhanpur constituency seat even as his party unravels elsewhere. While his hopes for a fifth term in power may have been dashed, the four-time Tripura CM will still be regarded as one of India's cleanest politicians. 
 
 The BJP-Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) combine was leading in 40 seats and was set to end the 25-year uninterrupted rule of the CPM-led Left Front in Tripura.
 
 Election in 59 seats for the 60-member Assembly was held on February 18. Polling was deferred in one seat due to the death of a CPM candidate.
