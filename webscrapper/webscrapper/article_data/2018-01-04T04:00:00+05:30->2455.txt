Gandhinagar: The Hindu Spiritual & Service Fair (HSSF) will start from January 5 at Gujarat University Ground in which around 4 lakh visitors are expected. The fair is being organized by Hindu Spiritual and Service foundation (HSSF). Organizers said the foundation’s aim is to protect, promote and propagate ‘sanatana dharma’. Swami Dayananda Saraswati is the chairman of the board of trustees. Narayanbhai Meghani, secretary of the foundation said, “HSSF has adopted the meaning of the terms Hindu and Hindutva as defined by the Supreme Court of India.” He said, “The Supreme Court had stated that the term Hinduism encompasses the culture and ethos of the people of the India depicting their way of life and is not a narrow religious idea.”  He added that the court in effect had held that the philosophy on Hinduism, which is tolerant of other faiths, is consistent with the secular spirit of Indian Constitution.’’ Speaking about the fair, Meghani said, “The HSS fair 2018 had integrated six issues in its theme. The concepts of conservation of forest and protection of wildlife, preservation of ecology, sustaining environment inculcating family and human values, fostering honour of women, and instilling patriotism will be the core aims of the fair.” Meghani said their aim was to persuade and encourage all Hindu spiritual and service ofganizations to take up these contemporary issues and bring about lifestyle changes that can save humanity from increased exposure to environmental, ecological and cultural degradation. “More than 300 institutions are participating in the fair and around four lakh visitors are expected from January 5-8,” said Meghani.
