PATIALA: Nine juveniles escaped from an observation home in   on Sunday.

 Sources said the boys took the advantage of ongoing construction work to flee after breaking the lock of their barrack and using a ladder to scale the 20-ft high boundary wall.
 
 Three of them are facing charges of murder, one for attempt to murder, one is accused of rape, two are booked under charges of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and while two are facing charges of theft.
 
 Sources said two wardens and four security guards were present in the home when the juveniles escaped. The observation home has a capacity for 50 boys but 122 boys were lodged at present.
 
 The police have registered a case and initiated inquiry.
 
 Sources said the accused had a few days back destroyed   cameras on the premises. The authorities, however, had not got them repaired, sources said.
