 Not to be outdone,   who plays Padmavati's husband  , has been working out since the last six months with his trainer   to acquire some lean muscles. 
 
 The actor kicked off a boot camp-like regime in July, which included functional training, cross fit and training at the beach with ladders, tyres, ropes and sand bags, six days a week for two and a half hours. "The aim was to lose some body fat and gain lean muscles," explains Samir. He's got a new diet too -four-five portions in a day with broccoli, asparagus, black and brown rice and pulses for proteins. "The training and diet plan intensified 40 days before he began shooting in November with him going off salt and sugar for 15 days when close-ups were taken. Now they start the portions of him in royal costumes and since he needs to look bigger, we've added more carbs."
