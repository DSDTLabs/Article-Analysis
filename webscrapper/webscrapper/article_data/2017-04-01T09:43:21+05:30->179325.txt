AMRITSAR: With the tricolor on the nation’s tallest flagpole getting replaced for the fourth time in a month,   and   former chairperson Suresh Mahajan wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday to seek a CBI probe into the project, a brainchild of his party colleague and former local bodies minister Anil Joshi. 

 Talking to TOI, Mahajan said there had been a “huge price difference” between the earlier proposal and the one that finally materialised. “Earlier, there was a proposal to install an 85-metre-tall flagpole; it was to cost Rs 99. 97 lakh. Later, the height was increased to 105 metres and the cost came to Rs 3.43 crore,” he said.
 
 When contacted, Joshi said politics was behind the entire controversy and his rivals started making a hue and cry over the project even before the assembly elections. “The company which installed the flag had promised to provide 12 flags and two persons for its maintenance, and bear   for two years. These were included in the project cost. It is the department’s responsibility to check all  , not the minister’s work,” said Joshi.
