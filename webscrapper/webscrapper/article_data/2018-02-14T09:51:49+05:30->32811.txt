LUCKNOW: A jobless youth from   has written to   leaders   and   to help him start a 'pakoda' stall. In his letter, the youth - Ashwin Mishra - has urged the two leaders to appeal to the PM on his behalf to get him a loan sanctioned under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana so that he could start his business. 

 "My search for a job ended when I watched Prime Minister  's interview on a TV channel wherein he mentioned about opening a 'pakoda' joint. I was extremely delighted over the suggestion and felt that I can not only earn for my family but also give a job to others." He added that when he went ahead with the idea, he realised that he did not have enough funds. 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 "Since I didn't have enough funds to start a good stall, I went to banks for a loan but to no avail. To my surprise and contrary to claim by the PM and many ministers that 10 crore persons have benefited from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, the banks refused to give me any loan," Ashwin, who is a former chief of social media cell of Amethi BJP, writes.
 
 "I cannot believe that the PM's words were false. The attitude of the banks has compelled me to write to you and appeal to the PM on my behalf to get a loan sanctioned for me so that I could start my 'pakoda' business," he concludes. 
 
 The letter has given the opposition a chance to corner the BJP government. Local Congress leader Achche Lal said: "Claims made by the BJP government are being exposed everyday. This is just another example."
