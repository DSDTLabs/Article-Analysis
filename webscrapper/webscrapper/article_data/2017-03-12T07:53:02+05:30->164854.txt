THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A  's truing up petitions for the year 2013-14 and 2014-15 by the   (KSERC) would be held here on March 15. 

 Truing up is an accounting exercise that will set the power utility's projections regarding its income and expenditure estimated at the beginning of the year against the actual expenditure and revenue at the end of the year so as to arrive at the actual estimate of surplus or loss. Though filing of truing up petition with the power regulator of the state is mandatory, the board is often accused of not filing the same on time. The board in turn often terms the calculations by the commission as unrealistic and keeps on challenging the same with appellate authorities.
 
 As per the truing up petition filed by KSEB with the commission, the revenue gap between the amount approved by the commission and the audited statement of accounts of the board for the year 2013-14 was Rs 490.21 cr. The figure for 2014-15 stood at Rs 1,329.87 crore.
 
 According to the aggregate revenue and   approved by the board on April 30, 2013,  's revenue gap for the 2013-14 period would have been Rs 460.97 crore. In the truing up petition, the board has claimed that the figure is Rs 951.18 crore and the difference between actual revenue gap and approved gap by the commission was Rs 490.21 crore.
 
 Similarly, the difference in revenue gap between the figure approved by the commission for 2014-15 year and the truing up petition of the board is Rs 1,329.87 crore, the board claimed in its petition submitted to the commission.
 
 The board had not been filing tariff petition before the commission for a many years as it had raised objections to the commission's attitude towards the board's expenditure on certain heads of accounts such as salary and other benefits to employees. Though the commission has initiated suo moto proceedings to fix the  , the process is not yet complete due to various reasons, including political and legal hurdles in finalising it.
