LUDHIANA: The police arrested a factory worker for raping his minor neighbour in a   village on Thursday. 

 The 13-year-old was alone at home when the accused, 19, sexually assaulted her. 
 
 
  
  
 The mother of the rape survivor said in her police complaint, “I have five children, including two daughters. After my husband left for his job on Thursday morning, I went out for some work. The accused barged in around 10am when my daughter was at home along with her year-old brother and her other siblings were playing outside. After violating her, he fled.”
 
 The minor’s mother said when she returned home, she found her daughter crying. 
 
 “After much persuasion, she apprised me of the incident,” she added.
 
 The family then informed the police.
 
 Investigating officer assistant sub-inspector (ASI)   said, “The accused was arrested from Jamalpur, where he lived with his parents, in the evening. The medical examination of the rape survivor as well as the accused was conducted at civil hospital.” 
 
 Police said the accused, a native of Bihar, knew the girl’s family and was waiting for an opportunity to target her. “He found it on Thursday when the minor was alone at home. A case under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act has been registered,” the cop added.
