MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Friday set the Election Com- mission of India ( ) a fresh deadline of July 31 to inform whether it could rein in political parties and ensure public property was not defaced with illegal hoardings and banners.

 The HC, in its January 31, 2017 judgment on illegal hoardings and banners, had said the time had come for the ECI “to step in so that necessary policy can be formulated.”
 
 It also said it would be ne- cessary for the ECI “to consider whether a condition can be imposed on the association or body seeking registration as a political party that it will not indulge in defacing public property.” ECI was then granted time till July 31, 2017 to take a decision. However, when the matter came up for hearing on Friday, ECI’s advocate   urged for at least six more months. But a bench of justices Abhay   and Riyaz Chagla pointed out that sufficient time had been given. “It’s virtually an extension of one year,” justice Oka pointed out. Rajagopal informed that a similar issue was pending before the   high court and said the stand taken there by the ECI “will be taken before this court.”
 
 The state’s advocate said it would provide two armed police constables in each of the 24 wards in Mumbai to accompany civic staff that goes to remove illegal hoardings and banners.
 
 Taking note that most corporations had not complied with various directions issued by the court, the HC granted them “one more opportunity.” They cautioned that failure to demonstrate substantial compliance would result in contempt notices to civic chiefs “at the next date itself.”
