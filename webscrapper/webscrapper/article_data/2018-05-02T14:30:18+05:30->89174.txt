AGRA: UP cabinet minister   has landed in a controversy after he ate food ordered from an eatery instead of the meal prepared at the house of a dalit family in   on Monday night. The visit was in line with  's "outreach programme" for the community. 

 
 Rana along with several other BJP leaders landed up at the residence of Rajnish  , a dalit, in Lohagadh, Aligarh district, around 11 pm on Monday. "I was not aware of the minister's visit. Everything appeared preplanned. I was asked to sit in the house. Dinner was brought from outside along with bottles of mineral water. It was just a formality or a photo-op for the minister to be at a dalit's house," Singh told TOI.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Some of the food items arranged for Rana, who was supposed to dine at the dalit household, included dal makhni, mattar paneer, pulao, tandoori roti and gulab jamun for dessert. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Asked about his choice of food at the dalit household, Rana flatly refused the allegation against him and said that they ordered food from a local sweetshop as there were nearly 100 people accompanying him. "I had dinner in their drawing room and also ate food prepared by the family. They were well aware about my visit," he said.
 
  
  
 Under the ‘Gram Swaraj Abhiyan’, which was launched earlier this month, the BJP has asked its MPs, including union ministers to spend at least a night in villages where SCs/STs constitute over 50% of the population. 
 
  
  
 They have been asked to ensure everyone in such villages is covered under government schemes that aim to provide LPG connections, vaccination to children, 'Jan Dhan' accounts and electricity for households.
 
 The campaign is being seen as a part of the BJP’s massive outreach to the rural poor, especially the Dalits, as it gears up for a string of assembly elections leading to the Lok Sabha polls due next year
