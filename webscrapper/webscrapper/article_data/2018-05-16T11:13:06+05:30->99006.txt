PUNE: Five persons robbed Dilip Shivram Bhosale (52) and his wife of gold ornaments and cash worth Rs1.97 lakh on Monday around 11.15pm at the   section.

 Bhosale, a resident of Vinzar village in Velhe Taluka, works as the bus conductor with Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC). He is posted at Swargate bus stand. 
 
 Bhosale was returning home with his wife in his car after attending a wedding at Hnandwadi when two men riding motorcycles blocked their way. The MSRTC conductor had no other option but to stop his four-wheeler. Three accomplices of the bike-borne duo surfaced and robbed Bhosale and his wife of ornaments, cash and documents.
 
 Sub-inspector D R Mohite of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said, “Just before a check post at the   ghat section, Bhosale had to stop the car when two motorcyclists blocked his way. When he started questioning the duo, three more men reached the spot and threatened Bhosale with sharp weapons.”
 
 The suspects then forced Bhosale and his wife to come out of the car. “They snatched two gold chains of Bhosale’s wife, Rs10,000 from Bhosale’s wallet and his conductor’s licence, PAN and Aadhar Card. Thereafter, they fled the scene,” Mohite said.
 
 Bhosale then went to the Rajgad police station to lodge a complaint, where he was directed to the Bharati Vidyapeeth police. 
 
 “We have registered a offence under Section 395 (dacoity) of the Indian Penal Code,” Mohite added.
 
 A couple of years ago, six men riding two motorcycles robbed two managers of separate petrol pumps in Khed-Shivapur collectively of Rs 50.27 lakh in the same area. Both the men had suffered injuries in that incident.
