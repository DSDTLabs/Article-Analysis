Like many leading ladies of Marathi film industry, light-eyed beauty   Behere too got married at the peak of her career to film director-producer   in November last year. She opted for a destination wedding in Goa. After a sabbatical, she is back to doing what she does best, acting.   actress who was recently in the city spoke to us on getting back to work post marriage and more… 

 Life has taken a happy turn post marriage, confesses Prarthana and adds, “It is perceived that offers dry up post marriage especially for the actresses but thankfully for me things are looking up. I’m currently busy promoting What’s Up Lagna and apart from that I have four interesting projects in my kitty.”
 
 So, how did she find her Mr Perfect? To this, she says, “Ours is an arranged marriage. We got engaged 15 days after our first meeting. We are still in the process of understanding each other better and every day, I get to discover something new about my husband. But I now strongly endorsed arranged marriages to everyone. I feel whatever our parents decide for us is always the best. Though I never wanted to marry an actor or somebody from the industry Abhishek’s vast experience in this field has helped me a great deal. I seek his advice before making any crucial decisions. This is the best phase of my life for sure.” 
 
 Ask her about one major change that her husband has brought into her life and she couldn’t stop gushing over him. “As I was living alone in Mumbai before marriage, I would get up late or go out for coffee at any random time. In fact, I have survived on noodles for days. But I’m thankful to Abhishek who’s changed this lifestyle; I lead a disciplined life now. And I also have helped him control his temper,” says she.
