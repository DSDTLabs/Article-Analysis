BENGALURU: A city   has asked home appliances major   to pay a refund of Rs 29,000 to a customer for a defunct washing machine, after the company failed to comply with warranty norms.

 The firm has also been ordered to pay Rs 50,000 as compensation for causing mental agony and Rs 5,000 towards litigation charges. Complainant Madan Raj, 61, from Nagarathpet purchased an   washing machine on May 1, 2014 from a showroom in Jayanagar for Rs 29,000. In November 2015, the machine stopped functioning properly, following which Madan lodged a complaint with IFBâ€™s customer care. A service engineer visited his house in a few days and informed him that some parts needed to be replaced. During subsequent visits, the staffers told Madan to go for an exchange offer since many parts of the machine had gone out of production. While the complainant pointed out the four-year warranty period, IFB insisted he buy a new machine at 50% of the cost.
 
 Madan approached a consumer court on July 7, 2017 demanding compensation for his loss. The 3rd Additional Bangalore Urban District Consumer Disputes Redressal   heard arguments from the complainant and IFB. The firm argued the complaint was false but ascertained that Madan had purchased their washing machine. A technician inspected the machine and said there was no need to replace any parts. He determined the iron on the top cover of the washing machine was rusted but was not covered under the warranty.
 
 Countering the point, the complainant produced the warranty card which said all parts of the washing machine were covered. The judges found IFB to be deficient in service, saying it neither replaced the defective part nor resolved the problem. This caused mental agony to the customer, who was promised topclass service and a four-year warranty for the entire machine. In July, the court ruled in favour of Madan by ordering IFB Industries Limited based in Mahadevapura to refund him Rs 29,000 with interest, along with other charges.
