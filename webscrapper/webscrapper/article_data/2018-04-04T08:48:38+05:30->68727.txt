MYSURU: The long-pending demand for a giraffe from  , Bengaluru, to the Mysuru Zoo authorities, was fulfilled on Tuesday. 

 
 Though Bannerghatta authorities had asked for male and female giraffes, Mysuru Zoo handed over only Gowri, a female giraffe, who was transported to Bannerghatta successfully.
  
  
 Initially, the zoo authorities wanted to give away three-and-half-year-old Babli, and had made all arrangements, including a cage, for her. But   didn't come anywhere near the cage set up at the enclosure. Later, the zoo authorities decided to give away Gowri, who is 13.5ft tall and 2.2 years old. Gowri was born on December 19, 2015, to Krishnaraja and Lakshmi.
  
  
 Gowri was handed over as per instructions of the additional principal chief conservator of forests & member secretary, Zoo Authority of Karnataka, Mysuru. C Ravishankar, executive director of Mysuru Zoo, told TOI, "Initially, we had planned to send Bubli, who is nearly 15ft tall, but she wasn't comfortable, so we decided to send Gowri, who has responded well. On Tuesday, we transported her in a special 12-wheel low-bed trailer to Bannerghatta Biological Park."
  
  
 Before Gowri was transported, the zoo authorities conducted two or three road surveys and wherever necessary, they chopped off branches and fixed electric poles coming in the way, Ravishankar said. They also held talks with the electricity department to switch off electricity during the animal's journey. The animal departed Mysuru at 12.30pm and reached Bannerghatta Biological Park at 8pm, covering nearly 200km without any hindrance.
  
  
 Gowri came along with veterinarians from both Mysuru Zoo and Bannerghatta Biological Park, animal keepers and other related staff members. 
 
  
 
 Mysuru Zoo has six giraffes, four female and two male. Krishnaraja, 23, is the oldest in the zoo. Among four female giraffes, Khushi is expected to deliver in May, and Lakshmi in July.
