VADODARA: Foods and Drugs Control Administration of Gujarat has permitted city-based   to restart its activities. 

 It was last month that three city-based blood banks - Indu Voluntary Blood Bank, Suraktam Blood Bank and   - were asked to suspend their operations following an inspection of reports carried out last year. 
 
 Food and Drug Control and Central Drug Standard Control Organization had stated that these blood banks had allegedly accepted and given infected blood to patients. 
 
 The authorities of the blood banks had rejected the claims on the grounds that the blood samples are tested based on ELISA method, which is a screening method and not a confirmatory method. They had argued that if a blood sample once tests positive, they conduct two other tests. If the two test results are negative, the blood is given. 
 
 “This protocol was also explained to the inspection team which had not taken the negative reports into consideration,” said Dr Vijay Shah, honorary medical director of the blood bank. 
 
 “On February 4, a four-member inspection team came for reinspection after which we were issued permission to restart,” he said, adding that samples of blood collected from donors and transmitted to recipients were again tested. “Their reports are negative,” he said.
