Actress   was in the news recently for her absence from the audio launch event of her upcoming film,  . At the audio launch, actor-director   said that it’s the duty of artistes to be available for the promotion of their movies. He also added that henceforth, producers may think twice before casting Ineya since she opted to stay out of the event without citing any reason. He went on to add that the actress is not even in the top league of heroines.

 However, when we contacted Ineya, she denied the allegations, saying, “I had suffered an ankle sprain a few days before the audio launch and my doctor had asked me to rest for 10 days. I am not able to walk properly even now. I was also down with food poisoning and was admitted to a private hospital in Adyar.”
 
 The actress adds that she did not get any invitation, but only a WhatsApp message about the audio launch. “Normally, the artistes are invited by the crew. That did not happen in this case. But I was not upset with them.” She had also conveyed her inability to attend the event to the film’s crew. “I had even messaged the pictures of my twisted leg to them, but the damage had already been done,” she says.
 
 Ineya says that she is not upset with Bhagyaraj for the scathing remarks the latter made at the event. “Bhagyaraj sir is a very senior artiste and I respect him. He attended the event as a chief guest and whatever he spoke on the occasion was based on the information shared by the film’s crew.”
 
 The whole issue, according to her, has been blown out of proportion. “Thanks to this incident, I have been portrayed as an irresponsible person with a lot of attitude. I wish people verify things before they allege something.” 
 
 Sathura Adi 3500, which is billed as a heroine-centric film, has Ineya playing a ghost. The actress has  , too, in Tamil and has also completed the Malayalam remake of  .
