AHMEDABAD: The gang   from Naliya on Tuesday filed an affidavit in the  , rebutting the state government’s claims that the probe is going in the proper direction and due care is being taken in supervising it.

 The 20-year-old rape survivor stated that Naliya police had deliberately delayed taking action on her complaint, and leaked details of her complaint to the accused, so as to enable them to destroy evidence and pressurize her. Despite her specific complaint, investigators have not taken any action against the culprits.
 
 The girl told the HC that policemen continued to pressurize her to withdraw her complaint. She cited an incident of March 17 in this regard, when she visited the police station. She accused the cops of not conducting a proper probe into her claims of a sex racket being run at Lohana Bhavan in Bhuj by three persons – Vipul Thakkar, “Bhabhi” and “Payal”. Police claimed to have taken statements of many people, but she was never called to identify the three. The victim also accused the cops of inaction into her complaint about the revealing of her identity.
 
 Expressing dissatisfaction about the probe, she reiterated that the investigation should be transferred.
 
 The HC is likely to hear the case on Wednesday.
 
 The rape survivor has moved the HC seeking the transfer of investigation to CID (crime) or to appoint a woman officer to head the special investigation team (SIT). The state government in its reply told the HC that the probe is in-depth and in the proper direction. A woman police officer looks after the probe, which is supervised by four higher officials. The government has commissioned a judicial probe in this case. All eight accused persons named in the FIR are behind bars.
