HYDERABAD:   registered only one case this year as of April, according to a   reply given by the department. This, when it has a pendency of around 402 cases. Even as the Forum for Good Governance (FGG) complained to the state government regarding the high pendency of cases, CID chief Govind Singh said the pendency rate has actually decreased, from 510 to 402. 

 
 
 FGG had written a letter to chief secretary SK Joshi on May 28, seeking a review of the situation. The CID has a budget of around 3.5 crore and a staff strength of 820, but there still is considerable pendency. 
 
 As per information provided by CID SP (admin), KP  , for the RTI filed by FGG, the budget for CID has been increasing since bifurcation. It has grown from 1.13 crore in 2014-15 to 3.5 crore in 2017-18. 
 
 M  , FGG secretary, alleged in his letter to the CS: "While the pendency was 278 in June 2014, now it has increased to 403. The Indiramma housing scam probe has been kept in cold storage. In several situations, while handing cases over to the CID, the state government puts a time limit for completion of investigation. Despite that, some cases have dragged on for years. We have requested the chief secretary to review the pending cases and also revamp the department for their quick disposal."
 
 A CID official said, "The department cleared 35 cases by April. In 2017, we disposed of 104 cases. We have now got staff on deputation, and we are seriously pursuing the pending cases."
