Life came a full circle for   Rajput when he performed amid a bevy of beauties at the recent 62nd Jio   2017. While this was his first act at Bollywood’s most popular awards show as a star, his maiden outing on the stage was way back in 2000.

 Back then, he was one of the background dancers while stars like   performed. Not many recall that Sushant had started his journey in showbiz as a dancer with Shiamak Davar’s troupe. It was then that he became an actor on television. So, performing at the Awards night again, this time as a lead actor was a nostalgic moment.
