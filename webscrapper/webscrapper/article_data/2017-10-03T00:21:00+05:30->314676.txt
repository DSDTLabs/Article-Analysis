 App misuse | Teacher who went to police under pressure to forgive student, authorities won’t like to take hasty decision
 
 Chandigarh: The disciplinary committee against a third-year student who allegedly used mobile-phone tricks to abuse teachers and blackmail juniors at the Sector-32 Government Medical College and Hospital ( ) will have its first meeting on Tuesday, a month after receiving the complaint on September 1.
 
 Asked why the student remains unpunished, Dr AK Janmeja, who holds additional charge of the GMCH director principal, said: “We cannot take a hasty decision on a sensitive matter where someone’ career is at stake. However, the action will set an example.” Using an app that changed the caller’s voice and flashed someone else’s number to the receiver, the student had abused teachers on mobile phone and tried to blackmail a junior, who recognised the prankster and went to the principal.
 
 “When the student has confessed that he was up to mischief, the delay in taking action has sent a wrong message to the other students that one can get away with anything,” said a member of the GMCH faculty. A college professor whose mobile-phone number flashed during prank calls to colleagues even went to police. Since the student apologised before cyber police, the case hasn’t moved forward. “I have been asked to keep the student’s future in mind before taking any action,” said the teacher. “The cops also requested me to excuse him. I wait for the college to take a call.”
 
 It is still not certain if the student’s mobile phone was hacked or he used an to mask his number and voice.
