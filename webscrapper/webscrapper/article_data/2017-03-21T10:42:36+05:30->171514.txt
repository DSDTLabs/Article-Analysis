Suhana enters the room and asks Sona if her leg is fine. The two spend some time together. In the morning, Sona gets up and goes out and sees Golu fuming. When she asks Golu about what happened, he tells her that a parent threw stone at Dev to win the game and now Dev is injured. Dev and Sona both get their leg injured. Teacher comes then to tell them about a running competition between parents.
 
  Teacher asks Suhana who will participate from her side and she says no one as both are injured. Dev says he will as Suhana's father.
  
  Race starts and while running Dev's injured leg starts bleeding. Sona and Suhana look at him sadly. Dev then hits his head to a pipe and falls down. Suhana remembers telling Dev that she will call him papa when he gains respect. She loudly shouts 'papa' and Dev gets surprised.
  
  
 
  
  She happily runs towards him and hugs him. Teacher gives the best parent-child trophy to Dev and Suhana.
  
  Dev requests Sona to let him spend one more day with Suhana and even she can join.
  
  Dev then takes Suhana and Sona to an orphanage. He tells them that because Suhana has accepted him as her father, he wants to share this happiness by distributing toys and food to underprivileged children. Sona gets impressed by this gesture.
  
  Suhana then tells Dev and Sona that she wants her parents to stay together. Dev tells her that he cannot be a good husband. Sona then says that either she will stay with both of them or not with any of them. Dev and Sona stand speechless.
