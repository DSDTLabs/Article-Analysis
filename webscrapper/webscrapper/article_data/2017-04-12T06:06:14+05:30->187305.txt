KOLKATA: The rush for tickets of   outscored the rising temperature at the maidan on Tuesday as hundreds queued up outside the Mohammedan Sporting Club counters to pick up passes for the Thursday clash.

 Mercury soared to 37.3°C on Tuesday but for the fans, sweating it out in the sun and getting a mean tan was small price to pay for a seat at the   to watch KKR in action against Glenn Maxwell-led Kings XI Punjab.
 
 Some fans came in early and queued up even before the ticket counters opened at 10am. Saikat Das, who runs a glass manufacturing unit in Naihati, skipped work for the first half of the day and came to Kolkata with his brother-in-law to buy eight tickets. “The heat is killing but I am ready to pay this much price to watch my favourite teams in action. Plus, I can get to see   and possibly  ,” he said.
 
 Techies Tathagata Chatterjee and Pramod Barik, could not skip work like Das. So, they reached office early, logged in at 8am and then left at 10am to pick up their tickets bought online and return to Rajarhat by 2 pm and work till 9pm. “We had to sacrifice a few hours of sleep and work some extra hours but we have managed to get the tickets. That’s the reward in itself,” said Chatterjee, a die-hard KKR fan. 
 
 The craze for tickets also brought out the ‘blackers’ out of their dens. “Shady-looking men and women bought multiple tickets of lower denominations the moment the counter opened. These are the tickets that are mostly sold in ‘black’ outside,” said a man manning the counter, adding that they had informed the cops but they “did nothing”.
 
 The truth in the fact stated by the man was evident as a policeman was found sharing a laugh with two ‘blackers’ over ice-creams and nimbu-pani and did nothing to nab them. The group even lied to those coming to buy tickets, saying that there were no tickets available in the counter and they should buy directly from them.
