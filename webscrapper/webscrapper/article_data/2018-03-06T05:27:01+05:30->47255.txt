GURUGRAM: New   commissioner  , after taking charge on Monday, listed out his priorities as the civic body chief and said he would ensure all public services are delivered in the shortest time possible. 

 As to how he would go about doing this, he said he was forming a citizen’s committee to track and monitor the pace of development work under the corporation. 
 
 “Not only will the citizen’s committee track development works undertaken by MCG, but also keep an eye on the quality of work being done. It will also give suggestions for the betterment of the system,” said Yadav in an official release. 
 
 Pressing on the importance of better communication between the department and the public, he directed all officials and division heads to be in their offices by 11am-12pm every day, to meet citizens and attend to their grievances. 
 
 On the work front, Yadav said he will start with sewage, sanitation and water supply systems in the city. Among other things, he also discussed a few MCG projects such as a proposed slaughterhouse, the C&D waste management plant at  , and the status of land parcels owned by MCG in Gurugram.
 
 Yadav was one among 15 officers who were transferred by the state government in a bureaucratic reshuffle on Thursday. Having served as the   administrator for two years, Yadav comes with a good knowledge of the city. However, he has some difficult projects to undertake ahead of him, such as the takeover of private colonies, rampant illegal construction and encroachment, and water scarcity during summers.
