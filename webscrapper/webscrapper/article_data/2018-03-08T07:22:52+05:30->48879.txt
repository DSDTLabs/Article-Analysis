CUTTACK:   on Wednesday alleging inaction of the   towards   belonging to   

 Two lawyers - S Sahoo and S N Banerjee - have moved the high court seeking the removal of all encroachments from the land of Lord Jagannath.
 
 The petitioners have cited that according to official records, Lord Jagannath owns 56,000 acres of landed properties in 30 districts in the state as well as other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. But more than 40% of the land have been reportedly encroached upon by land mafias and other influential people. 
 
 The petitioners have contended that the property of Lord Jagannath is being looted openly and the state government and the temple administration has clearly failed to check the practice and protect the properties. The temple administration is not only losing its properties, the government too is incurring huge losses due to the encroachments.
 
 Seeking the high court's intervention in the matter, the petitioner has urged the court to pass necessary direction to the state government to verify the land record details and conduct a proper survey to ascertain the exact area of land owned by Lord Jagannath. 
 
 "We have also prayed that the government should free Jagannath's land of all encroachments and take measures to record it back in the Lord's name," said Ashok Mohapatra, the petitioner's counsel.
