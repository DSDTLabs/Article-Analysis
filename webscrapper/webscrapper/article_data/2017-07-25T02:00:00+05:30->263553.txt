 MU admissions: Most of the Magadh University-affiliated colleges in the city are likely to extend the deadline for submission of admission forms for Intermediate and degree courses beyond July 25 due to strike by non-teaching staff. These colleges had earlier extended the deadline from July 14 to July 25. “There is a possibility that the date will be further extended as the process is far from complete and the non-teaching staff of universities have once again resorted to strike in support of their demands, including salary revision and assured career promotion,” said a source.
