VADODARA: Two months after a   had lodged a complaint alleging that he was robbed of Rs 2.25 crore, the probe in the case has been transferred to the   (DCB) 

 City police commissioner   said that the DCB had some leads in the case and it will be solved swiftly. 
 
 “I decided to give the case to DCB as it will be able to nab the accused on the basis of the leads it has,” Sashidhar told TOI. 
 
 The businessman Milin Shah had approached the Bapod police station in November last year and filed a complaint against Vicky Kahar and Karan Chauhan alleging that they looted Rs 2.25 crore from him. 
 
 Shah had said that Chauhan had introduced himself as crime branch sleuth and threatened him. “Shah’s application says that Kahar and Chauhan sat in his car and then took him to Waghodia. There were six other persons including a woman in other cars who accompanied Kahar and Chauhan. Shah was taken near Waghodia police station,” the police said.
 
 Kahar and Chauhan then threatened Shah and his accountant with a revolver and fled with Rs 2.15 crore cash. Sources in the police said that Shah wanted to convert the black money into white. Kahar had promised that he would help convert his cash into white money following which he came down to Vadodara. 
 
 Questions were being raised as none of the accused had been nabbed after one-and-half months of the incident. “The accused had approached both district court and Gujarat high court for anticipatory bail but their applications were rejected,” Sashidhar added.
