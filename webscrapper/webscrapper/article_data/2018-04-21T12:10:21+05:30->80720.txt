COLVA: Despite the door-to-door   collection drive implemented by the   about a year ago, many people continue to dump plastic bags filled with garbage on the roadsides on the city outskirts.

 The ring-road in   is one such prime example. Almost 1km of the road, from the   to the Konkan Railway Station, Apollo Hospital and beyond, is littered with such garbage-laden plastic bags. 
 
 In the absence of bins, residents dump the waste by the roadside. To add to the woes, MMC has failed to clear the garbage. MMC sanitary inspector   claimed that the garbage is not generated by the residents, but by the traders and hoteliers doing business in   and by the villagers along the periphery of the city who have become habituated to bringing their garbage in plastic bags and dumping the same by the roadside.
 
 A similar situation, last September, had compelled the MMC’s sanitary cell to employ people to thoroughly clean the area. Today, however, the situation is back to square one. People who use this road frequently attribute much of this problem to MMC’s failure to provide bins for people to dump their garbage bags. Another factor, they say, is that the garbage collection trucks do not cover the area on their rounds. The growing mounds of garbage filled bags are proof of it.
 
 Disagreeing with sanitary inspector blaming the villagers along the periphery of the city, former MMC chairperson Savio Coutinho questioned as to where the waste generated by the small hotels and handcarts, which are open late into the night, is discarded. Coutinho said the MMC should either have security personnel posted at the site or install a CCTV cameras to identify violators who should then be fined.
