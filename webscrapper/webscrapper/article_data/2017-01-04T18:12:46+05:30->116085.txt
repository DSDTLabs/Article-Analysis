COIMBATORE: Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company (AMC) announced the launch of ‘Flex SIP/STP’ (F-SIP/STP) for its investors. This facility allows investors to take advantage of market movements by investing higher when the markets are lower.

 The F-SIP/STP is based on the trailing ‘Price-to-Equity’ ratio (P/E) of Nifty-50 index. The amount to be transferred on each installment of   will be determined on the basis of the P/E band of Nifty-50. If the P/E ratio is greater than 15, then the specified amount gets invested.
 
 If the P/E ratio is less than or equal to 15, then the default amount, which is three times the F-SIP amount, would be invested. Otherwise the specified amount in the application form would be invested. F-SIP/STP is available under the monthly and quarterly options. A minimum of six installments for enrolment is required under this option.
 
 “Valuation wise, the P/E ratio of Nifty-50 index at 15 is an attractive or cheap zone,” Kotak Mahindra AMC said. “Investing more in this phase will ensure better wealth creation over a period of time. Historical evidence suggests it occurs only around 30% of the time. Hence, it is unlikely to put undue pressure on the day-to-day finances of the investor,” it said.
 
 “By introducing F-SIP/STP, we are going a step further to help our investors better utilise market volatility. F-SIP/STP is an investment facility that enables investors to get more out of their SIP investments,” said Nilesh Shah, managing director, Kotak Mahindra AMC.
 
 “F-SIP/STP allows the investors to take greater advantage of the market valuations, which is the genesis of sound investing fundamentals. This in turn will help them achieve their investment goals,” he said. “Recent trends in investor behavior have been very encouraging. It is a right time now for Indian investors to efficiently participate in the Indian capital markets,” Shah stated.
