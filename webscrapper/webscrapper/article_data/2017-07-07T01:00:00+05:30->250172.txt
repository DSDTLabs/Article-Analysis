 Officials claim they have made all the registered persons aware of the hazards of unsafe sex in the last seven years since the project was initiated in 2010.
 
 The TI project for Hajipur is run the by Kanhai Shukla Social Research and Service Organisation with support from BSACS. Project director Sudhir Shukla said the beneficiaries include more than 400 women sex workers, 100 transgenders and 40 and odd male sex workers, especially men having sex with men.
 
 They are educated about safe sex habits and skills to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, as part of the project, Shukla said, adding they are also provided vocational training to enable them to explore avenues, other than sex work, for earning a livelihood.
 
 Shukla claimed 99% of them were now 100% aware about safe sex habits. “Around 7,000 condoms are supplied to them free of cost every month under the project. The supplies are made by peer educators who also train them in safe sex habits confidentially,” Shukla said and added mandatory medical examination for STDs was also being conducted on them after every six months.
 
 There are eight peer educators, including six women, who are engaged in educating and counselling the beneficiaries registered with the TI in Hajipur.
