Gurgaon: A   fell on a Swift Dzire in   and damaged the vehicle, besides plunging the whole sector into darkness, in the wee hours of Friday. Eyewitnesses alleged that at 3am, a truck crashed into an electric pole, bringing down the transformer. However, residents said discom officials were quick to arrive at the scene and restored power supply by Friday evening.

 Residents told TOI that trucks keep bringing construction material into the area as a private contractor is carrying out upgradation work at the Sukhrali pond. They claimed that one such truck knocked down an electric pole that supported two local transformers. 
 
 Hitesh, RWA president, Sector 17C, said, “A truck is said to have hit the pole. The driver should have been more careful.”
 
 Residents said that after the electric pole came crashing down, there was an immediate power shutdown in the area. “We suffered a power outage, starting Friday morning, and it wasn’t fixed till Friday evening,” a resident said.
 
 Some residents praised DHBVN for heeding to their request and promptly arriving at the scene to restore power supply. 
 
 “The kind of damage the electric pole had underwent when it fell made us think that it would be many days before power supply is restored. However, the discom staff got the supply restored the same day. We are very thankful to them,” Hitesh said.
 
 According to residents, the   that was completely damaged, belonged to a tenant in the area. TOI could not reach the person. 
 
 TOI spoke to councillor Anoop Singh who said he had talked with authorities concerned about the matter and that the issue had been resolved.
