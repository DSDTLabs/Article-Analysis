CHENNAI: Chief minister   on Monday accused opposition parties of resorting to agitation against revision of bus fare for political gains. “They   to protest for pay revision and also hold agitation against fare revision. How can we run the administration? The protests are meant to bring about a crisis,” Palaniswami told reporters as   held road blockades across the state.

 On Sunday, the state government reduced the bus fare by 20% in select services. The CM said the transport corporations catered to 1.4 crore passengers a day but suffered severe losses.
 
 “While the price of diesel was Rs 43.10 per litre in 2011, it shot up to Rs 67.23 per litre now. The cost of spare parts too is 30% more expensive. We had to revise wages every three years. We pay Rs 492.96 crore   now, Rs 240.59 crore higher than during the previous regime," Palaniswami said. 
 
 The chief minister said the revision had not made any difference as the   corporations continued to make Rs 12 crore loss a day.
