Our skin the is our largest organ and it probably hates  . The quality of colours used to play with is highly questionable and has long lasting effects on our health and the planet

 Holi is a spring festival and the colours were traditionally made with the flowers blooming in the season, herbs, spices and other, usually plant based, natural substances. Playing with them usually served to nourish the skin and hair and clothes were the only casualties. However now the colours available most easily and cheaply are made of chemicals and dyes. With vibrant shades, metallic sheens and neon hues these colours are very attractive, especially to children. The promises of permanent and long lasting are enticing for the playful pranksters but the consequences of these colours are more than skin deep. 
 
  
  
 
 These synthetic colours contain oxidized metals or industrial dyes, engine oil, diesel, acids, mica, glass powder and alkalis, most which are toxic and cause harm to the body. Itchiness, flaking and redness have become common post holi, but more severe reactions have been reported too. Rashes, blisters and other more violent allergic reactions occur in those with sensitive skin, or skin conditions like rosacea, acne and eczema.
 
 The green colour we see today is usually prepared from copper sulphate, which is known to cause eye allergies and even temporary blindness! The black colour is made from lead oxide and we all surely know the poisonous properties of lead from the brain to the rest of the body. The silver colour usually comes from aluminium bromide, a known carcinogen. Red colour is the product of mercury sulphite, which has been linked with mental retardation, paralysis and impaired vision. Chromium iodide used to make purple colour leads to bronchial asthma and allergies.
 
  
  
 These chemicals colours cause more harm once washed off. If the horrible effects it can have on your own body aren’t enough to put you off, the effects of these pretty colours on the environment are should be. They consist of highly structured polymers that will not break down naturally, according to a report done by Joy Joseph Gardner from University of Rajasthan and Deepanjali Lal from Jaipur National University who studied the effects of Holi colours on both water and soil.
 
 "These colours are prepared from harmful substances such as acids, mica, glass powder and alkalis. They are not readily degradable under natural conditions and are typically not removed from waste water by conventional waste water treatments. Thus, several bacteria have been found to decolourise, transform and completely mineralise coloured soil and water in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions," said the report.
 
 So this year, try using natural colours. With the collective consciousness of society realising the harmful effects of chemical colours and gravitating towards natural and organic colours, many companies have started producing natural, environment and skin friendly colours. 
 
 
 
 - Even if the package says it’s natural, do be sure to check the ingredients to see they haven’t snuck in some chemicals to add some vibrancy to the colours.
 -Many Ayurvedic medicine brands produce colours around this time of the year. They usually have good quality ingredients and can be trusted.
 -Natural cosmetic companies also make colours that will be good for your skin so if you have a trusted brand, buy from them
 - Look for certification that all the ingredients are organic. Though there are many agencies that certify Indian products are verifiably organic.
 
  
  
 However many companies don’t get certificates for a product that’s barely sold for a week in a year and if you’re scared to risk it, don’t worry. You can easily make colour with things already in your own kitchen. All these will be safe for the skin and hair, and biodegradable.
 
 
 
 - Dried and powdered rose petals are commonly used to make pink coloured powder, though roses are available in many other colours and you can got lots of colours
 
 - Beetroot powder produces a lovely magenta red colour
 
 - Blue usually naturally occurs rarely in nature however many flowers in India can be used to make it. Aprajita, jacaranda or blue hibiscus are good options 
 
 - dried and powdered leaves are good for green. Henna, coriander and spinach are good options.
 
 - any most powdered pulses make a good yellow however turmeric is the best. It has the brilliant quality of staining everything but your skin. 
 
 
 
 Mix any of the above mentioned powders with water to make liquid colour. You can also boil or soak certain plant compounds overnight to make coloured water.
 
 
 - Boil marigold flowers in water and leave overnight.
 
 - Soak dried aparajita flowers in water to turn it an inky blue. Berries of the indigo tree can be crushed into paste and mixed with water as well. 
 
 - Hibiscus flower tea makes a lovely red coloured concoction as does boiled pomegranate peels left overnight
 
 - Making a paste of green leaves like spinach and mixing it with water makes a lovely green.
 
 So this year play Holi safely. Use organic or plant based products to play so you can spread health as you spread colour and cheer this year.
