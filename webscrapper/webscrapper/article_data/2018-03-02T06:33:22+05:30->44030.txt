 “We were startled to know that less than 20% of the slums get access to low cost pads. We decided to take this on as a mission,” said  , president,  , a student-run NGO within SRM University. With 90 students participating in the initiative, each student is entrusted with raising Rs 10,000 within 12 days. The campaign has raised Rs 5.5 lakh already.
 
 “Initially, we were unsure about even raisingRs 1 lakh though the cost of supplying one woman with pads for a year is only Rs 250. We have already raisedRs 5.5 lakh,” said Dadich.
 
 Once they raise Rs 9 lakh, the students plan to procure and supply these pads for a year on a monthly basis. “We have already identified suppliers and are negotiating with them. If all goes well, we should be able to start distributing by April 1,” he said.
 
 Ranganath Thota, founder, FuelADream said, “It is a simple and high impact initiative and the need of the hour. Supplying pads for a year will definitely ensure awareness and change in behavior for these girls and women. Crowdfunding is a great enabler and will ensure sufficient funds are raised to meet the needs of the students”
