I got Bimal Roy’s ‘Bandini’ (1963) because of that. Jab pehla shot diya tha to maine kaha, ‘Dharmendra, it’s now or never.’ I was fortunate.Mujhe lalach nahi tha. When I started working in films, my first aim was to own a Fiat car and nothing more than that. The day I bought my first Fiat car, I went to   and he asked me to take him for a spin. He blessed me that I should experience many such moments like this in my life. What a lovely soul Bimal da was.”
