HYDERABAD: A day after a man died when a portion of an old building in Chandanagar’s   collapsed while it was being demolished,   has now turned its focus on buildings which are in a dilapidated condition. Senior GHMC babus agree that several buildings in the city are pretty much in a bad state and pose a risk to the lives of those residing in them or close to their vicinity.

 If officials are to be believed, there are over 100 old buildings which are in a very bad shape in GHMC’s   covering IT corridor. Apparently, Chandanagar falls in the west zone. Senior GHMC officials said they are fast identifying the most dilapidated structures and serving notices to the occupants to vacate the premises.
 
 The officials claimed around 400 structurally unfit buildings have been pulled down in the last two years. “Some of the owners have approached us after renovating the buildings. But, we will first inspect the structures, study their stablility and issue a fitness certificate. Most of the old buildings in the west zone are concentrated in Kukatpally circle,” said K Malikarjun, city planner, GHMC west zone.
 
 Not only the IT corridor, dilapidated buildings in Kachiguda,  , Koti near   and Malakpet are a cause of worry to the authorities. In Himayatnagar, some of the establishments are operating clothing outlets in an old building. “The structure poses a threat to commuters and passers-by close the structure,” an official said.
 
 Residents are equally worried about the condition of such buildings. “These structures can proved to be fatal for people during heavy downpour. The authorities should pull down such structures immediately before the monsoon sets in,” Uday Shankar, a bank employee, argued.
