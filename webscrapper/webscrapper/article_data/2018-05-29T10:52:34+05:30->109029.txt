CHANDIGARH: Even as the fate of candidates for Shahkot assembly byelection was sealed in ballot boxes on Monday, the Election Commission ( ) has taken note of two complaints of alleged model code of conduct violations against   chief minister   and urban bodies’ minister Navjot Singh Sidhu.

 Punjab’s chief electoral officer (CEO) S Karuna Raju confirmed on Monday that two separate reports had been sent to the EC at Delhi about the incidents involving the incumbent Congress after conducting inquiries. He, however, refused to elaborate on the reports as these were still under consideration of the EC.
 
 Ahead of Shahkot assembly bypoll, Sidhu had on April 29, announced Rs 10 lakh grant to a college during its convocation function. Later, on May 8, the CM had held a press conference at the Jalandhar district headquarters.
 
 “Sidhu’s announcement was about giving grants and that is not acceptable, we have submitted that,” said Raju, refusing to elaborate further. Asked if it was an adverse report, he added, “I can’t say that but going by the model code of conduct, if anyone declares grants, it is a violation.”
 
 Sources said a report was sought from Jalandhar deputy commissioner on the issue to which the chief electoral officer added his observations.
 
 “On the complaint about the CM’s press conference, an inquiry was conducted, besides verbatim examination. A detailed report has been sent to the EC with observations,” the CEO said, adding, “the press conference was at district headquarter while the model code of conduct was imposed in the constituency. The issue was only the use of the guesthouse.”
 
 Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had accused Amarinder of violating the model code of conduct by holding a press conference on the Shahkot bypoll and urged the Election Commission to inquire into it.
