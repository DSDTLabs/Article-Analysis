THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Governor   gave his assent to the   promulgated by the state government to rein in self-financing medical colleges in the state. The ordinance gave more power to the admission supervisory and fee regulatory committee.

 CM   told reporters that the ordinance was promulgated in view of the SC verdict that declared   rank mandatory to consider candidates for admission to   and BDS in all medical colleges of the country. An all-party meeting and discussion with college managements too had pointed out the need for a new legislation in view of the new norms and practices, following the SC verdict.
 
 The Kerala medical education (regulation and control of admission to private medical institutions) bill 2017 was promulgated as an ordinance. A retired judge from the   or high court would be the chairman of the admission supervisory and fee regulatory committee being set up as per the provisions of the ordinance. There will be government and MCI representatives in the committee.
 
 The panel will have the right to fix the fee as per SC guidelines. Agreements on admission and fee would be signed by the committee. Since there is already an admission and fee regulatory committee, the same committee would be reconstituted. Once fee for a course is fixed, it would be valid throughout the course period. Also, the managements should collect only the yearâ€™s fee. Excess fee collected would be considered as capitation fee.
