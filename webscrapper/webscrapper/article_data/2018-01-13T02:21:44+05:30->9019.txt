 The HC bench, headed by Justice  , warned that if it finds non-compliance by corporations, it will take action for contempt of court against the authorities concerned.

 The HC bench said except for setting up a committee to monitor the action taken against illegal hoardings, “nothing further has been done”. 
 
 After the petitioner’s advocate,  , pointed out that there were “illegal hoardings in every corner” of the state, Justice Oka said, “It should not be difficult for the state to accept that there is huge defacement of all cities. The law is laid down.” The HC noted that Mumbai was among the three corporations that had filed compliance reports. —Rosy Sequeira
