AMRITSAR: In an apparent contravention of both the visa and religious norms, a dozen Indian Sikhs, mainly women, who have travelled to Pakistan as pilgrims to celebrate Baisakhi, were caught on camera selling wares and doing brisk business inside  , Hasan Abdal.

 In a video clip recorded on a mobile phone, which was sent to TOI by one of the Indian Sikh devotees on Tuesday, men and women can be seen putting up vends inside Gurdwara Panja Sahib complex, haggling and selling Indian knick-knacks and clothes to Pakistani customers.
 
 The Sikh devotee, who didn’t wish to give his name, said a handful of pligrims had brought various items such as pressure cookers, women suits, mangal sutras, bindis, women rings and other ornaments, for sale as they are reportedly in demand in Pakistan.
 
 “Not only people from Hasan Abdal had arrived at the gurdwara to buy Indian goods, many from nearby villages also knew about the arrival of the Indian Sikh jatha and setting up of a temporary market by them,” said sources.
 
 They said these business travellers, who were in Pakistan under the garb of pilgrimage, were from Amritsar, Faridabad and Delhi. They had managed to procure visas through a group of kar sewaks (volunteers).
 
 A Sikh jatha comprising as many as 1,800 pilgrims form India had left for pilgrimage via Attari border on April 12 and stayed at Gurdwara Panja Sahib before leaving for   on April 15.
 
 Sources said two officials of the Indian high commission had arrived at Gurdwara Nankana Sahib and were prevented by Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) general secretary Gopal Singh Chawla from entering the shrine. In a video shared with TOI, Chawla is seen introducing himself to the officials as chairman of Punjabi Sikh Sangat. Chawla is known to have close relations with one of most wanted terrorists Hafiz Saeed. In the past he had put up his photographs with Hafiz on social media.
