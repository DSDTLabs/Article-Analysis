GOLD COAST:   continued with his impressive record in the Commonwealth Games, nailing down the men's 10m air pistol gold with a new Games record here on Monday. He had won the gold medal in 50m pistol event in Glasgow Games four years ago.

 
 
 
 
 "I've got the result of my hard work and I'm very happy. Once I get the lead, I don't look back. That's how I focus myself. Once I get ahead, my aim is to get further ahead and never to look back," Rai said after adding another gold to his impressive haul.
 
 The Army soldier, who was in fourth place after the preliminary round, overcame the temptation to pull the trigger early in the final to grab the gold with a total of 235.1 points. Australian Kerry Bell came second in 233.5 while Jitu's compatriot  , who topped the qualification, grabbed the bronze.
 
 Comparing his career graph before and after the Rio Games, where he went in with huge expectations and came a cropper, Rai said: "I have won quite a few medals after the Rio Games. But my success rate has come down compared to what it was before. But after Rio, I have tried to ensure that if I reach a final I do not return empty handed. So far, it has worked that way for me," he said with pride.
 
 Asked about Bell closing the gap, Rai said he was never aware of that. "I was only focusing on my shooting and getting my technique right," he said. "I pressed the trigger early once (in the final) and it got me the eight (8.4)," he added. That was the only blip.
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 Young   settled for silver after tying with Singapore's   on 247.7 points after 24 shots. In the tiebreaker shot that followed, Mehuli recorded 9.9 while the Singaporean fired a 10.3 for gold. Defending champ   went into the final in great form, beating the Games record in qualification but faltered towards the end. She was tied for the lead after 20 shots but fell behind on the 21st and 22nd shots to move to third.
