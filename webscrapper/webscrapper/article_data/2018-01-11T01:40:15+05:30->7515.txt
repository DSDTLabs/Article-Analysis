MUMBAI: Bombay   on Wednesday asked the state to explain if a notice was served to a “gau rakshak” before an order was passed to extern him from   district for a year. 

 A division bench was hearing a petition by the   resident, Machhindra   (29), challenging his externment. 
 
 The court has given the state two weeks to file its affidavit. Shirke said he is an “animal lover” and has claimed that he was illegally externed as no notice was served on him. The police have cited nine cases against Shirke since 2012 for the externment proceedings.
