AHMEDABAD: Even as the city was gearing up to welcome Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and cops were busy conducting VVIP security drills, chain-snatchers wreaked havoc in the posh   area on Tuesday morning. The chain-snatchers, targeting two men, fled with four   chains worth Rs 1.45 lakh.

 Cops are nonplussed by the new trend — chain-snatchers going after men instead of their regular prey, elderly women. Cops said the chain-snatching cases of Tuesday could have been executed by the same robbers. “In both cases, the chain-snatchers approached their mark head-on rather than sneaking up from behind them,” a top police official said. “We have gathered CCTV footage from cameras installed in buildings located near the scene of the crime.”
 
  According to a complaint lodged by  , 55, a resident of Satyagrah Chavni — who runs a travel business — he was on his regular morning walk when two bike-borne robbers grabbed his chain near Tirthdham Apartments. “The pillion rider, who was in his thirties and wearing a T-shirt and a pair of jeans, snatched his gold chain,” the official said. “The duo sped away towards the SG Road. The person driving the bike was wearing a helmet.” In another complaint, Abha Keswala, a resident of Pratiksha Apartments in Sola, has stated that he had been visiting relatives at Surya Mandir in Vastrapur when he was robbed. “On Tuesday, at about 7.30am when   came down to have a cup of tea at a stall located just opposite the apartments, two persons on a bike snatched his three gold chains worth Rs 1.20 lakh,” a senior police official said.
 
 City police chief A K Singh has directed the city crime branch to identify and crack down on chain-snatchers.
