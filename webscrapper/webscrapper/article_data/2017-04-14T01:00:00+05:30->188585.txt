 has just begun to shoot with   for   Das’ biopic on writer Saadat Hasan  . She plays his wife Safiyah, who stood by him through thick and thin. 

 Rasika’s look in the film comes pretty close to what Safiyah actually looked like. Bring up the similarities and she laughs, “I was amazed when I looked at myself in the mirror. Make-up can do wonders, but here, it almost created a twin. It’s half the battle won.” 
 
 About her experience of shooting with Nawaz, who plays Manto, Rasika says, “It’s early days, we’ve just begun to work together. He’s pretty good with the scenes. It’s challenging to match what he does in every single scene.” While there’s plenty of information available on Manto, precious little is known about Safiyah. The actress says that she went through articles and the material gathered by Nandita’s team in the course of writing the film. 
 
 “They had met Manto’s daughter, who lives in Pakistan. She shared a lot of information about her mother and the equation her parents shared. Some of Manto’s short stories also had references to his wife. There’s only so much you can do as prep. You can’t completely replicate the chemistry a man shared with his wife. As characters, Nawaz and I will have to bring in our own twist to their relationship,” Rasika sums up.
