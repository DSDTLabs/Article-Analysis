AHMEDABAD: Mukesh Tanna, alias  , alias Suresh Thakkar — allegedly one of the biggest suppliers of   in Gujarat — was arrested by   on January 11.

 Tanna, who has liquor trafficking cases registered against him in Godhra, will now be brought to Gujarat. A team of Godhra police has left with a transfer warrant to bring him to the state to face the law. Tanna is presently in judicial custody in Goa.
 
 Godhra SP Rajendrasinh Chudasama said Tanna, who operates under different names in Mumbai, Goa and Gujarat, was wanted in liquor trafficking cases registered in Godhra and Vejalpur.
 
 “We intercepted at a truck in Dahod which had set off from Vadodara and seized liquor worth Rs 55 lakh. We then arrested two persons, while Tanna’s name surfaced during the interrogation of the accused. He was on the run since then,” added Chudasama.
 
 Police sources said Tanna used to operate by the name Mukesh Tanna in Gujarat, Suresh Thakkar in Goa and Mahesh Tanna as well.
 
 “He owns a distillery in Goa. We suspect Tanna would supply liquor to Gujarat from his distillery without records of production. We are probing the issue with Goa police,” said a senior police official.
 
 Chudasama said they have information that Tanna is not only involved in illegal trafficking of liquor into Gujarat but also other illegal activities.
 
 “We will interrogate him once he is brought here. We have information on some of his associates who could be involved in liquor trafficking. Tanna is big catch and we hope his arrest will throw light on several other cases,” said a senior police official.
