She donated one of her kidneys to save the child who was suffering from  . On the eve of International Women's Day and ahead of World Kidney Day, Priyanka and two other women, who donated their kidneys to their grandchildren (six-year-old and 9-year-old), were felicitated. 

  Priyanka's child was on peritoneal dialysis for the past one and half years. Getting a donor of her age was a difficult task and her growth was eventually slowed down. She also suffered from associated morbidities like anaemia, hypertension, liver ailments and intellectual disability. However, Priyanka's decision changed things for the better. The kidney was successfully transplanted in January. 
 
  "Transplanting an adult kidney on a four-year-old is as challenging as getting a young donor for kids. The size of the recipient's kidney and blood vessels were smaller. However, advance technology and expertise of doctors ensured a successful transplant. The adult kidney can be transplanted on children with the help of the latest surgical techniques and excellent paediatric nephrology support," Dr  , paediatric nephrologist at Rainbow Children's Hospital, said.
