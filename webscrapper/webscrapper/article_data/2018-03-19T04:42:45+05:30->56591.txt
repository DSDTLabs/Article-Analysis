NEW DELHI: Punjab minister   took the big stage to tick all the columns — criticise BJP, slam PM   by name, praise   and Rahul sky high and, above all, apologise to former PM   for what he may have said about him in his avatar as BJP’s rabble-rouser.

 There was much anticipation about Sidhu, known for his oratory, and he did not disappoint as he held the AICC plenary spellbound for half an hour. Sonia was his first port of call among the leaders in the front row. He called her “incomparable”.
 
 Pointing to Manmohan Singh in the front row, he offered a profuse apology spanning minutes that swung from unctuous praise for his vision as economist to strident assault on his successor Modi.
 
 Having mocked him as “mauni” (silent) in the past, Sidhu said it took him a decade to realise that “Singh’s silence had achieved what BJP’s din could not do”.
 
 The Punjab leader said Singh was both “sardar” and “asardar” (effective), letting out his trademark Sidhuisms while adding he had redeemed himself at the veteran’s feet. Sidhu appeared keen to convey that his break from BJP was final —   is an “Arabian horse” which even if weak, is better than a “stable of donkeys”.
 
 The “homecoming” was best achieved by citing his earlier proximity to the saffron leadership to assert they were “hollow”. He said “Rahul Bhai” would unfurl the Tricolour from the   and he would not rest till it happened. He said it was because of Priyanka Gandhi that he joined the party.
