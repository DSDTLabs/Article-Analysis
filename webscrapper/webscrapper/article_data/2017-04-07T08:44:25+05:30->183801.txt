LUCKNOW: The   is struggling to follow its own action plan to check   (VBD), despite the high court's strict directions, issued last year following   in the city. 

 Though mosquitoes have started ringing in from every nook and corner and five cases of dengue have been reported since January, the   (TFC) constituted in November for VBD prevention has only met twice so far and not taken any concrete action. 
 
  This, when the court in October last year had recorded the performance of the health department as a "complete failure of constitutional machinery" in preventing, controlling, managing and treating dengue epidemic which infected 1,020 persons and claimed 18 lives. Another 23 deaths were recorded as 'suspected dengue deaths'.
 
 When contacted, deputy CMO (Vector-borne diseases) Dr Sunil Rawat said, "We have been taking inter-departmental meetings around dengue constantly along with spreading awareness at all levels of the machinery. There is definitely a need for the TFC to brainstorm again and will be looked into at the earliest in consultation with the district magistrate".
