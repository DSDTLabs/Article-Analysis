BENGALURU: An 18-year-old undergraduate engineering student hanged herself from a ceiling fan at her home near  , off Mysuru Road, southwest Bengaluru, on Tuesday afternoon. She didn’t leave a suicide note. Her parents alleged she had been bullied by her classmates for losing in the class representative elections.

 Meghana C was a first-semester civil engineering student at   of Engineering, Kumaraswamy Layout. She is survived by her banker-parents, Chandrashekar and Lata, and elder sister Bhavana, an engineer.
 
 While the Chandrashekars alleged that bullying by four classmates and a faculty member pushed Meghana to take the extreme step, the college said she was irregular to class and had flunked in a couple of subjects in the first semester. Police have booked the four students and faculty member for abetting Meghana’s suicide.
  
  
 
 The family resided on the second floor of   apartment at  , Channasandra, off RR Nagar. According to Lata, Bhavana knocked on the door of her sister’s locked room around 3.30pm. When there was no response, she looked through the window.
 
 “I was shocked to see my younger sister hanging from the ceiling fan. I shouted for help and our security guard Lalu came running. He broke open the door of the bedroom. By then, other neighbours, too, had come,” police quoted Bhavana as saying. Bhavana called her mother and informed her of the tragedy. “The Chandrashekars rushed home around 4.15pm,” a neighbour said.
 
 Apartment security personnel said Meghana had walked into the apartment around 1.30pm. Since Chandrashekar has a vision problem, Lata filed the police complaint, accusing a head of the department of Dayananda Sagar College and four classmates of Meghana of abetting the suicide.
