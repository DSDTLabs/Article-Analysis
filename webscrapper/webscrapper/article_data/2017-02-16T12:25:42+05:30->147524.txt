CHANDIGARH: Reacting to the arrest of   mastermind from the alleged house of an AAP worker, Punjab Congress president   on Wednesday sought a probe into what he called Delhi chief minister  's "nexus" with militants and gangsters in the state.

 The Congress chief ministerial candidate flagged concern over the arrest of Gurpreet Singh Sekhon from the house of an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) activist, just two weeks after Kejriwal had courted controversy by staying at a KLF militant's home in Punjab.
 
 There is apparently a "strong nexus between AAP and the militants as well as dreaded gangsters, posing a major threat to Punjab's security and safety", alleged Amarinder, demanding an independent investigation, preferably by a central agency, into the party's "dangerous" links.
 
 With the Maur bomb blast also being traced to KLF and occurring just a few days after Kejriwal's stay at KLF terrorist Gurwinder Singh's house during his Punjab visit ahead of the assembly polls, the situation warranted a detailed inquiry into what appeared to be "nefarious links" between AAP and anti-social elements, he said.
 
 Amarinder said while Kejriwal-led AAP had increasingly been exposing its "extremist ideology" in the run-up to the polls, things had now come to a head in the wake of the latest reports of Sekhon's arrest from the home of party activist Goldy Gill, an NRI who had been actively engaged in campaigning for his party.
 
 "It was no longer possible," he said, "to brush away controversial Kejriwal's stay as a mere coincidence, as the AAP leadership had been trying to project."
