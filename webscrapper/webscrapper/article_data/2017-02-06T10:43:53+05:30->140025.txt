PUNE: The   ( ) will tie-up with waste-pickers’ cooperative SWaCH, and intends to charge residents and business owners for garbage collection.

 Waste segregation in the Cantonment areas has had a number of false starts in the past decade. While the PCB had attempted to persuade housing societies and residents to practise segregation at source almost all programmes were abandoned after a while because at-source segregation was unknown to residents who accumulated and disposed of all the waste together. 
 
 They also admitted that health and sanitation department workers were inadequately trained to segregate waste, and the health department lacked the infrastructure from vehicles to facilities at the trenching grounds. 
 
 The board has turned towards SWaCH, the waste-pickers’ collective, noted for taking up segregation projects in the   and the   areas.
 
 “We are partnering with SWaCH because they have the expertise in waste segregation, as well as training the sanitation workers who will be engaged in the process. They will bring their own trained workers, and their job will be to collect waste from door-to-door, segregate the waste into dry and wet waste, and load it into PCB vehicles,” a senior PCB official said. 
 
 “Unless people pay for services, they will not realise the importance of cleanliness and waste management. SWaCh has a rate of Rs 60 per household per month, and that rate is Rs 120 for commercial properties,” PCB’s CEO DN Yadav said.
