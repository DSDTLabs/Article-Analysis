MUMBAI: Confusion among students about admission to second-year junior college (SYJC) continues as the state government is yet to issue instructions about the centralized process.The school education department has sent a proposal to the minister,  , to put off the plan for the next academic year. A decision on the issue is likely to be taken next week.

 Students move to different colleges after the first year for a change of stream or subjects or try to better the choice that was given to them during the centralized process. Until last year, students could go to colleges and complete the admissions offline.
 
 Overburdened with the Class XI admission, the education department hopes to put off the plan for second-year centralized admission to next year. B B Chavan, deputy director of education, Mumbai said, “This year, the FYJC admission is undergoing a major change. It will be very difficult to concentrate on both Class XI and XII admissions. A decision is likely to be made on Monday .“
 
 Tawde's nod to postpone the process could bring relief to several students and parents who are now on tenterhooks. “My daughter is unable to cope with Psychology and we want her to take Sociology next year. But her current college does not have the provision and hence we want to switch the insitute. The current college is also difficult in terms of commuting. We have made trips to various colleges but have only been told to wait,“ said  , mother of an Arts student.
 
 College authorities said they have very little choice. “We have asked students to wait since there are no instructions from the department,“ said  , vice-principal, VG Vaze College, Mulund.
