NEW DELHI: A seven-year-old girl studying in a government school in   has alleged that she was being sexually assaulted by two of her seniors over the past four months. 

 The girl alleged her seniors, who are in classes VIII and IX, took her into empty classrooms during lunch breaks or when her classes ended and made her perform obscene acts.
 
 Both accused girls have been apprehended. One of the girls is a Class IX student and is 19 years old. She had failed several times and so remained in the same class. The victim is being counselled by a local NGO to help ease her trauma.
 
 The assault was reported on Saturday around 12.10pm when the girl told her parents about the torture that she has been going through. Her father then called the police and lodged a complaint.
 
 "A team of women officers and NGO staffers were sent to the girl's house to investigate the case after her father called the  ," said joint commissioner (south-western range) Dependra Pathak.
 
  She was sent for   and, later counselled by the NGO.
 
 The police have termed this as a case of 'sexual perversion'. "The girls would make the victim take off her clothes and do obscene things to them. When she would refuse, they would threaten to harm her," said a senior police officer.
 
 A case under   sections 328 and 34 and the POCSO Act has been registered against the duo. "No other girl was targeted by them. We are talking to the school staff to know details. We will also conduct a sensitisation programme at the school," the officer added.
