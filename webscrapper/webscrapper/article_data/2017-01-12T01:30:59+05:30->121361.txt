GANDHINAGAR: Union urban development minister   on Wednesday dismissed fears of   causing a massive slowdown in the real estate sector. He said while speaking at Vibrant Gujarat Summit that a boom in the housing sector was imminent, with the government committed to providing a house to every Indian by 2022.

 “Yes, initially there is a slowdown but earlier, our   was in the godown. Now it will move on to the highway,” Naidu said, adding that demonetisation has heralded an era of transparency and revolutionised the way business is conducted in the country. “There will be ample opportunities in the real estate and housing sectors,” Naidu said. “With lower interest rates and a new real estate Act, there will be a boom in the housing sector,” he added. He rejected the charge that demonetisation has failed, saying the major proportion of black money has come into banks. “People ask where black money is if all of it has come back into banks. But not all that is deposited is white. All the notes deposited now have an address,” Naidu added.
 
 “It is Moody’s rating and not Modi’s rating which says that India is the only bright spot on the globe today for investment. The government is moving in step with   — which spells out to Mission Of Developing India,” Naidu said.
