BHUBANESWAR: The acquittal of seven poachers who were caught red-handed for possessing a leopard skin in the   (STR) in December last year has exposed the inadequacies in the investigation of the wildlife wing of the forest department. 

 The court has said the prosecution could not provide evidence beyond reasonable doubt to punish the arrested persons. The alleged poachers were arrested on December 25, 2014, and the trial had been taking place at a court in Baripada in Mayurbhanj district. 
 
 "Keeping in view the analysis of evidence, the prosecution has squarely failed to establish the guilt of the accused. It is held that the accused persons are not guilty of the offence under section 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972," said the court. 
 
 Patrolling staff of the wildlife wing had caught six people near Bangiriposhi in the Baripada forest division in the STR with two leopard skins packed in gunny bags. 
 
 The staff had seized the skin and booked them under  , 1972. 
 
 Secretary of the   of Odisha, Biswajit Mohanty, who has written to the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Siddhant Das, about the probe, said the prosecution had examined seven witnesses but failed to convince the court as the forest department had not provided them with ample evidence. 
 
 "In a November 2014 case as well, a poacher had been arrested after being caught with leopard skin. In this case also, the accused was freed due to lack of evidence," said Mohanty.
 
 "I have requested Das to review all the pending wildlife crimes and put in sincere effort to ensure conviction of the accused," Mohanty added. 
 
 According to the Wildlife Society, there has only been a five per cent conviction in case of wildlife crimes. "Between 1990 and 2010, 1,547 poaching cases have been registered, out of which prosecution was filed for 1,124 cases," said Mohanty. 
 
 Baripada divisional forest officer, Sanjay Swain, did not respond to calls for comments.
