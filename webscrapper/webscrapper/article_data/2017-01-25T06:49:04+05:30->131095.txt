NAGPUR: A fresh twist was added to the controversy over the   from   in Chhattisgarh by C-60   at   on January 20. The activists campaigning for the women were booked and their vehicle seized by the cops on Tuesday.

 Activists Sainu Gota and advocate Jagdish Meshram, who had tried to meet the women at district hospital at Gadchiroli, have been booked by the police for creating ruckus and obstructing police work. The cops have invoked Bombay Police Act against both Gota and Meshram. In addition, Meshram was also booked for being under the influence of alcohol. It was also reliably learnt that Sainu’s wife Sheila too was charged with preventive action.
 
 Another prominent activist Ram Jarate, who had been one of the most vociferous in protesting the so-called exploitation of the women, claimed their vehicle has been impounded by the cops and detained at Gadchiroli police station on the pretext of a trivial violation of not possessing some documents. “The vehicle was hired for the activists to help the women, her family and fight for their justice. The cops have crippled the activists’ team by seizing the vehicle,” he said.
 
 The activists, who met Gadchiroli collector ASR Naik earlier this week, are now planing a bigger movement. “We want the truth to prevail. Let the spontaneous version of the women come to fore, without their being in the custody or influence of police,” said Jarate.
