LONDON: Former RBI governor   may be among some of the world's leading economists in the running for the post of   (BoE) governor as the UK government hunts for a candidate to take charge from next year, according to a media report.

  
  
 Canada-born  , the current governor of England's central bank, is set to step down at the end of his term in June 2019. He had become the first foreigner in the post in three centuries when he took up the role in 2013. UK chancellor Philip Hammond has now indicated that his global hunt for Carney's successor is ongoing, indicating the next governor could well be a foreigner too. "Attracting Raghuram Rajan, the highly-respected Chicago-based economist and former RBI governor, would be a coup," said The Financial Times.
 
 In its own analysis of the pros and cons of 55-year-old Rajan's candidacy for the post, the newspaper notes that the Katherine Dusak Miller distinguished service professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business would bring with him "impeccable international economics and central banking experience" as well as "significant achievements at the  ".
 
 The con, in its view, would be that he has thus far shown "no indication that he would want the job at the BoE".
 
 On the newspaper's list of prospective candidates is another Indian-origin contender in Shriti Vadera, the chair of Santander UK and a former UK government business minister. The treasury is expected to advertise the post by July this year, a year before a new incumbent as the Bank of England chief is due to take charge.
