JAIPUR: Days after students of the five-year integrated course at the   (RU) sat on a hunger strike alleging that the institute did not have the necessary affiliation, the RU claimed that it has received affiliation from the competent   (BCI) on Monday. The statement issued by the RU says that students have been legally admitted during the 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 academic sessions.

 The university also rubbished the report claiming it has no affiliation to run the institute from 2015. “Students enrolled in these academic years have been admitted after receiving all required permissions from competent authorities,” said the statement.
 
 It further said that they have not received any communication from the BCI withdrawing affiliation to the law college. The university administration has also assured students of hiring the required number of faculty.
 
 Dron Yadav, a former student of the five-year integrated course, said that if the university has documents to prove it has affiliation, they should make it public and resolve the matter.
 
 R B Singh, head of the  , has already filed a PIL at the   against the alleged irregularities in self-financing courses, including the five-year integrated law course.
 
 “They are cheating students and it should be seen as a crime. Students should not be penalized for what the university has done,” said Singh.
