CHENNAI:   is on a roll. After beating Greece World No 19 Panagiotis Gionis in the previous tie, the Gujarat paddler defeated World No 23 Stefan Fegerl of Austria to provide   a solid start against   on the sixth day of the   (UTT) league at the   on Tuesday.

 India's star paddler Sharath Kamal, who was the leading the charge for Mavericks, must be a disappointed man on Tuesday night. Despite beating world No 8 Wong Chun Ting of Hong Kong 11-5, 11-6, 8-11, the Mavericks succumbed to a 11-16 defeat. They had a bad start on the opening day when they lost to Falcon TTC 12-15.
 
 Harmeet, who has been consistently improving over the last one year, was at his best on Tuesday. He broke into top-100 earlier this year and moved to 79 spot in quick time. With Tuesday's win, Maharashtra have won both their ties and are sitting on top of the league table with 31 points after two rounds.
 
 "It was important to give my team a good start and it feels great to beat world No 21. I'm an aggressive player and my intention to attack was clear from the word go. It's difficult to win two straight games after losing the first one. I'm glad that I could make a comeback.
 
 "I'm quite happy the way we have been playing the tournament and hoping to maintain our form in the remaining matches of the league," Harmeet said after the match.
