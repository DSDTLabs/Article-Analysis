CHANDIGARH: A court here on Saturday dismissed a former  's appeal against his conviction in a case of   Fatehgarh Sahib resident   was sentenced to two years in prison on May 13 last year for changing his date of birth in the Class X certificate he submitted to Chandigarh Transport Undertaking for appointment as a driver. 

 Achhar had filed an appeal in the court of additional sessions judge  , but did not get any relief from the court on Saturday. The additional sessions judge said the trial court had rightly convicted Achhar under sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 The case dates to October 18, 2012, when the then CTU general manager had filed a police complaint against Achhar, who was appointed as a drive in CTU in 2010. Achhar was convicted of changing his date of birth in the Class certificate from September 4, 1973, to September 4, 1975. The discrepancy had come to light when CTU had sent the certificate to Punjab School Education Board, from where Achhar did his Class X, for verification.
 
 The CTU had said Achhar, if he was born in 1975, was not eligible for the post of driver, as he had overshot the maximum age for appointment. "By tampering with the  , he has not only cheated the department, but also denied a genuine candidate the opportunity of appointment," the CTU had said.
 
 Feeling aggrieved with the orders of the court, Achhar had filed an appeal against the conviction while saying that, "He does not know as to whether the tampering was done after submission of documents or before submitting the same."
 
 The defence counsel had, in the appeal, told the court that there was no evidence against Achhar. "There are material discrepancies in the statements of prosecution witnesses, so the appeal should be accepted," he said.
 
 However, the court found no merit in the appeal and dismissed it.
