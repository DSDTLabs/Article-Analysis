MUMBAI: A   has been filed in Bombay high court to direct the Union government to change its laws to allow   to undergo medical termination of pregnancies even after 20 weeks. A division bench of justices Naresh Patil and Girish Kulkarni on Wednesday scheduled the PIL for hearing after three weeks. 

  Advocate Dipesh Siroya, counsel for the petitioner,  , said a similar issue was pending before the  . 
 
 Under Section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 20 weeks is the outer limit prescribed for termination of pregnancy. Rules allow pregnancy to be terminated within 20 weeks if the child would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped if it was born. Exceptions are made, especially if the mother's life is in danger. The court has said consideration can be made for a pregnant woman even beyond 20 weeks.
 
 The petition claimed the law was not adequate to fully protect minor survivors of rape and sexual assault. The PIL referred to applications filed by rape survivors to terminate their pregnancy which were rejected by various courts. "It is important to consider that a child may not realise she is being sexually abused and such abuse can lead to pregnancy," said the petition. "In many cases pregnancy is detected only when the child complains of nausea or abdominal pain or when abdominal bulge is visible. The Criminal Procedure Code casts doctors with the duty of providing immediate treatment to survivors of rape. Pregnancies due to rape are, however, not addressed as a health concern. Doctors distance themselves from providing the required care if the pregnancy is beyond 20 weeks and advise the family to go to courts," the petition added.
