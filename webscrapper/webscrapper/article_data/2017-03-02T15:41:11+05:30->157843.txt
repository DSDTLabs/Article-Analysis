 Ariana  , who was first reported to be dating Mac   in August last year and confirmed it the month following, has said her relationship with the   back much longer than that. 

  
  
 The 23-year-old pop star has opened up about her romance with the rapper as she recalls meeting him four years before she ever thought of dating him.
 
 "I met him when I was 19. We have loved and adored and respected each other since the beginning, since before we even met, just because we were fans of each other's talent," she said. 
 
 The "Into You" hitmaker, however, said that they were not ready to begin the relationship at the time. 
 
 "We weren't ready at all, though, to be together. It's just timing. We both needed to experience some things, but the love has been there the whole time."
