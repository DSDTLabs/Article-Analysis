NEW DELHI: Chief minister   on Sunday said he will seek an inquiry into  's decision to go cashless at 10 stations "forcing" commuters to opt for  , which is the only e-wallet available at these locations. 

 "It's being done forcefully, maybe as directed by the  . I will speak to Metro (authorities) and ask for the files. How can be they force a decision like this? They are promoting Paytm through this. I will seek an inquiry and look into the files," the CM said at a press conference he had called against demonetisation.
 
 Ten Metro stations went cashless from January 1. These stations will allow commuters to pay either through Paytm or smart cards. While the stations will have one counter open for cash transactions, DMRC had said it would eventually also be done away with. Delhi Metro claimed that a large section of commuters from these stations are already using smart cards. 
 
 Delhi Metro had clarified that more e-wallets would soon be roped in and the contract was awarded to Paytm through an open tender process. "Since DMRC at present has an ongoing agreement with Paytm, only one who bagged the contract through open tender process for encouraging cashless smart card top up, it was the natural choice to make a start for cashless transactions at 10 stations," said a statement. 
 
 The stations where the measure has been rolled out are Rohini East, Rohini West, MG Road, Mayur Vihar Phase I, Nirman Vihar, Tilak Nagar, Janakpuri West, Noida Sector 15, Nehru Place and Kailash Colony.
