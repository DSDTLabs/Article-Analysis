PUNE: The   police are investigating an investment fraud allegedly perpetrated by a solar panel businessman in the name of   project. 

 The suspect (name withheld) opened a bogus company in Koregaon Park area last July and lured investors, mostly from rural areas to whom he sold solar panels, telling them that his firm has entered into an agreement with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for providing e-bicycles and e-bikes under the Smart City project, and that they can get returns up to 20% per annum on their investments. 
 
 Initially, he even paid the promised returns to some investors to draw more of them. However, he soon stopped delivering on his promise, prompting one of the affected investors, Dhananjay Shitole (41) from Daund, to approach the police to lodge an FIR. 
 
 Two investors have recorded their statements as part of the FIR and the initial police probe has revealed the names of eight more affected people. “As of now, the total worth of the alleged fraud is more than Rs 50 lakh,” a police officer said.
 
 Koregaon Park sub-inspector M N Pawar told TOI, “The suspect is a resident of Dhankawdi and the victims hail from Khadakwasla, Daund, Ahmednagar and Pune.”
 
 Shitole said the suspect had duped him for Rs 1.21 lakh while his friend, Arun Pardeshi, who also recorded a statement, alleged that the suspect collected Rs 4.40 lakh from him between July and November, last year.
