NEW DELHI: A   rammed into a stationary Maruti Ritz, being run as a taxi, near Majnu Ka Tilla on Thursday. The driver of the SUV was found heavily drunk, police said. The cabbie had escaped with injuries on his arms and head. 

 According to the cab driver, Ashok Kumar, the incident happened in the early hours of Thursday. He was heading for ISBT Kashmere Gate after dropping a passenger at Punjabi Bagh but stopped midway. As soon as he parked his vehicle on the roadside near the Majnu Ka Tilla gurdwara, the white Range Rover rammed into his car from behind. 
 
 The BMW driver, later identified as Sandeep Kumar, had stepped out and started blaming Ashok for the accident. “After alighting from the SUV, he started looking for his mobile phone, which might have slipped out of his hand when he opened the door. An autorickshaw driver appeared on the scene, removed his keys and informed the police about the accident,” said Ashok.
 
 The Range Rover, belonging to a Civil Lines businessman, had a Chandigarh numberplate. The owner was present in the SUV when the accident took place. 
 
 Ashok was admitted to a trauma centre in Civil Lines. “He had fainted several times, probably due to the injuries. We will have him checked by a specialist,” said one of his relatives.
 
 A probe revealed that Sandeep had lost control of the vehicle while trying to save the SUV from hitting a divider and instead rammed into the car. Police have impounded the Range Rover and booked Sandeep for rash and negligent driving and under relevant sections of the MV Act.
 
 Ashok claims that Sandeep was so drunk that he could not stand properly. The cops are scanning CCTV footage to establish the sequence of events.
