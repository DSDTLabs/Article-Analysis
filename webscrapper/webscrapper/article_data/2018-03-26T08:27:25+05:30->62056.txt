CHENNAI: For students facing a financial crunch or those not academically inclined, Classes X and XII become key to what the future holds, as many of them drop out due to lack of awareness about options beyond mainstream courses. 

 Bhanu Chander, now a   at  , is familiar with this struggle. While pursuing mechanical engineering, money was a hurdle and so he began reaching out to students facing a similar situation. A few years ago, he started a blog with information on courses and entrance exams and has now prepared a poster of courses or career options for school passouts, especially in rural areas. 
  
  
 The comprehensive poster posted on his blog and some social networking sites is receiving a good response. "If we can create awareness among students about affordable courses and scholarship opportunities, many students could continue their studies," said Chander, who has done MS in robotics from IIT Madras. 
 
 It took a year for Chander to compile the list of courses, exams and scholarships. "After compiling the list of courses, I got the idea of making a poster that can be circulated on social media," said Chander, who calls his initiative Vidhya-Spurthi.
 
 But the man did not stop there. he realised there are several students with no access to the internet or computers? Hard copy of the poster was the only solution. Chander began sending the handy guide by post to schools in rural pockets of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. "The response was good. The teachers in the schools make copies of the poster and distribute it," said Chander with a smile. 
 
 He hopes, his   on a page will empower youngsters. For Chander, however, the journey never ends. He is now working on another project  , in which he plans to list out all the scholarships and the entrance exams that students can apply or take for free.
