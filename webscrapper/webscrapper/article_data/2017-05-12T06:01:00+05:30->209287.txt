MUMBAI: A   on Thursday upheld the central government’s move declaring controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik’s   (IRF) an “unlawful association”, and said there were sufficient reasons, including posing a threat to India’s security, for banning it. 

 The tribunal said, “On analysing the speeches delivered by  , it is abundantly clear that the same are provocative and derogatory.”
 
 The order came on a day the NIA approached   for a red corner notice (RCN) against Naik. The RCN will declare Naik an international fugitive and he can be arrested by any agency around the world. 
 
 The special tribunal, headed by Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal, said, “Talking of supremacy of Islam and comparing it with other religious communities or faith is not the work of intellectuals and scholars. It has emerged from the material placed before the tribunal that Zakir Naik was actually using IRF as a platform to propagate a radical version of Islam.”
 
 Naik’s move to flee India strengthened the tribunal’s conclusion. It noted, “Naik failed to participate in the legal proceedings, is absconding and untraceable and no explanation has come forth that... he never intended his speeches to be inflammatory or that he was apologetic.”
 
 Naik is said to be hiding either in the UAE or Saudi Arabia and keeps travelling to Malaysia and Indonesia, according to intelligence agencies.
 
 The IRF had moved the tribunal against the home ministry’s November 17, 2016, notification imposing ban on it. It claimed the government doctored Naik’s videos to mislead the court.
