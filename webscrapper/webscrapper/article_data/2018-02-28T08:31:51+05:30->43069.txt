HYDERABAD: Doctors point out how in addition to the common forms of   — type 2 diabetes which accounts for 90-95% of all detected forms of diabetes and type 1 diabetes which affects children — there are many other forms which are increasingly being recognised.

 
  
  
 Among the other forms of diabetes is 'Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY)”, a form of genetic diabetes caused by a single cell which affects young adults and children. Patients with   are usually lean and because of their young age, and often wrongly diagnosed as having type 1diabetes.
 
 A recently-conducted study among Indian diabetic patients on MODY diabetes by researchers from   (MDRF), Chennai, in collaboration with genomics company MedGenome, India, has discovered a novel MODY gene, called the ‘NKX6-1’ gene which has been found to be the cause of MODY.
 
 Doctors point out how the research will aid in precision care in ruling out cases of wrong diagnosis. The study was conducted based on genomic analysis of 289 individuals across from India, which included 152 clinically diagnosed MODY cases and 137 normal glucose tolerance (NGT) subjects.
 
 Dr V Mohan, director, MDRF said, “The significance of diagnosing monogenic forms of diabetes like MODY is that unless a correct diagnosis is made, patients can be wrongly diagnosed to have type 1 diabetes and advised to have unnecessary lifelong insulin injections. Once the diagnosis of MODY is confirmed, in most forms of MODY, insulin injections can be completely stopped and these patients can be treated with a very inexpensive sulphonylurea tablet which has been used for decades, for treating diabetes. This can cause a dramatic change as far as the treatment and the life of these patients and their families are concerned.”
