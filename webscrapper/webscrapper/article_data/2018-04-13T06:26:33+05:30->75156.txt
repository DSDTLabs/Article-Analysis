BENGALURU: Chief minister Siddaramaiah is set to have his way with the   for the  , cornering a lion’s share of the seats for his supporters.

 Sources said 90% of the first   list of 136 candidates, likely to be released on Friday, will be full of the chief minister’s nominees.
 
 The Congress election committee met late Thursday night in New Delhi to finalise the list, which will be released after discussions with Siddaramaiah, who left for the national capital earlier in the evening.
 
 The heft of Siddaramaiah — the first Congress CM after D Devaraj Urs to last a fiveyear term — and his capability to mobilise resources are said to have had the high command falling in line. Siddaramaiah reportedly told the AICC screening and campaign committees that they should heed him if they wanted to see the Congress return to power, sources claimed.
 
 The CM has reportedly not been accommodative of other camps in the party. His close aide HC Mahadevappa’s request for tickets for his son and himself is also likely to be turned down.
