New Delhi: Two   were   after two groups clashed in a prison   taking them to the Rohini court from   Jail. 

 Jail sources said more than 20 prisoners were in the van when an argument started over space to sit. One of the prisoners asked another for more space and when he refused, the prisoner started hitting him. The accused inmate tried to harm himself as well. The jailers intervened and took all of them to the Janakpuri police station. Both the injured were rushed to a hospital. 
 
 The police said the incident took place on Thursday evening. The van had reached Janakpuri when the guards heard a lot of noise and found a couple of inmates attacking a youth with a sharp object. 
 
 The police guards immediately stopped the van and entered the prisoners’ chamber to stop them. Sources said that when the van stopped, some prisoners even tried to get out of the vehicle. However, they were stopped in time. As the Janakpuri police station was barely a few metres away from the spot, the guards immediately decided to go there. 
 
 At the police station, the inmates were taken out of the van amid high security. The injured inmates were taken to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital for treatment. The local police was informed about the incident and a case was registered at the Hari Nagar police station. 
 
 “We reached the spot and found that the two prisoners had suffered minor injuries. The van then took the rest of the prisoners back to Tihar Jail,” said a police officer. Jail officials said that the van guards had no idea how the prisoners had managed to get a sharp object with them. An inquiry into it has been started.
