BENGALURU: Will ace cricketer   be the poll mascot this year? The   ( ), which is scouting for prominent personalities like cricketers, movie stars and other public figures to be the face of the 2018 Karnataka election, reportedly has Dravid on its radar.

 
 The Under-19 World Cup winning squad coach and Karnataka’s “suputra” (son) who received praise from Prime Minister   for his dedication to the country, could be the ideal choice. However, the EC is yet to approach Dravid.
 
 With “accessibility” being the theme of this year’s election, the EC is also looking out for a few differentlyabled and aged personalities to popularize the democratic process later this year.
 
 EC sources said the Karnataka CEO’s office has reached out to at least eight personalities, but none has confirmed participation.
 
 The names include Arjuna award recipients, including a blind cricketer,   awardees and Sandalwood stars who can help EC generate the much-needed energy to propel the state into the ballot process. The EC is also said to have approached retired armed forces officers, considering they are the “fittest” among those over 60 years.
 
 Other cricketing personalities from the state have also been considered by the EC, provided they set aside their political affiliations.
