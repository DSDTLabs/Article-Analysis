She may be one of Bollywoodâ€™s biggest names, but at heart,   is a keeper of family traditions and rituals. On Saturday, the actor flew to her hometown, Mangaluru, to perform the final round of religious rites of her father,  , who succumbed to cancer in Mumbai recently. 

 Accompanied by her mother Vrinda, Aishwarya landed in the city at 10.40 am. Though they were originally slated to make their first stop at   temple in Kadri, following which they had planned to head to the neighbouring town of Uppinangadi, they had to deviate slightly from the schedule. The family proceeded straight to Uppinangadi as they had to immerse the mortal remains by 12.30 pm at Triveni Sangama, near the   temple. Aishwarya is visiting Mangaluru for two days and is expected to leave for Mumbai on Sunday evening.
