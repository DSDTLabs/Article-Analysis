Coimbatore: Nippon Paint (India) is targeting a 10% market share in the decorative paints segment in the south within the next five years, a senior official said. The company would expand its depots or warehouses from the current 14 to 20 by the end of 2018 to improve its presence in tier-3 and tier-4 towns, said S Mahesh Anand, president, decorative business, Nippon Paint (India).

 The Japanese paint major, which started its operations in India in 2006, has about 3% market share in the south now. “Paint is a product that needs wider distribution. We need to be as close as possible to customers,” Anand said.
 
 Nippon has a presence in around 1200 stores out of the 24000-odd stores that sell paint products in South India, he said. “We want to be a prominent player in the south,” he said. The company’s products are available in about 2000 out of the 45000-odd outlets that retail paint in the country. Nippon also sells its products through nearly 200 exclusive stores.
 
 Though the demand for paint has dropped by about 5% following the slowdown in property development and demonetisation, Anand said that the industry would see a recovery in the second half of 2017 due to affordable housing and smart cities projects initiated by the union government. 
 
 Nippon has started a training academy for painters in Chennai where it has a plant with a production capacity of 7000 kilo litres per month. The company is trying to get accreditation for the centre from the National Skill Development Corporation, Anand informed.
 
 The company is planning to open these centres in Coimbatore, Tiruchi, Madurai and Tirunelveli. Nippon has introduced ‘select store’, a new retail format that offers end-to-end painting solutions—from products to painting services.
