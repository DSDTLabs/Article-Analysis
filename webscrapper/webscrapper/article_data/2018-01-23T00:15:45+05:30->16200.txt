NAVI MUMBAI: Officials from the   ( ) have been on their toes since over a month to ensure that the city bags the   (ODF) tag. The   had failed to bag the status last month when the   rejected the claim after finding a private plot in Turbhe slum area defecated.

 The NMMC is confident that this time they will pass the litmus test.
 
 A team will re-evaluate the city’s stature and then certify it. This tag will add another advantage towards bagging the Swachh Survekshan ranking. An independent team of four officials, associated with ODF survey, from Delhi— under the direction of the ministry of drinking water and sanitation, housing and urban affairs—has arrived in the city on Monday to stamp its final authority as the ODF city. 
 
 An NMMC official accompanying the central team said that the observers have covered almost all pockets that are prone to open defecation— including railway corridor, slum areas, public toilets and civic schools. “We are sure that we will retain the ODF tag since the entire civic workforce has been discharging their duties sincerely,” said an official. 
 
 NMMC commissioner Ramaswami N, along with his subordinates, have been taking rounds to almost all nodes and slum pockets on a daily basis to ensure that cleanliness is maintained. “Our team has done an excellent job over a period of time as far as maintenance of civic sanitation is concerned. We have no doubts in meeting the evaluation parameters,” said Ramaswami. 
 
 The visit of the squad to the city will revalidate NMMC’s claim being open defecation free urban conglomerate. The revalidation is done every six month. The satellite town of Navi Mumbai was ranked as Maharashtra’s cleanest city and 8th in the country last year. It is struggling to maintain its status as open defecation free with the growing population and mushrooming of slum pockets.
