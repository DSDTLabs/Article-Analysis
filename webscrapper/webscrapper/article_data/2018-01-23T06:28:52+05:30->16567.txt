CHENNAI: On January 23,   who have expertise in different domains -- from media and healthcare to law - will get together for the Visionary Women's Conference at the Anna Centenary Library Auditorium. The idea is to share information and create the right networking platform for women entrepreneurs. The event is organised by   (Women   Development Organisation). 

 "Our aim is economic empowerment through entrepreneurship," says  , who established WEDO in September 2015. "We create intrapreneurs out of women who do not want to invest in business. While an entrepreneur is someone who is willing to take a risk, many women don't do it for various reasons. So, we have a lot of untapped resources -- homemakers and working women - and they can earn an income through a simple referral earning platform."
 
 WEDO also runs the  , which is a network of professional women who have a vision of their own. "We work on goals and chase it for every woman and we want to create such circles across the world," says Kadambari.
 
 As an extension to the conference being held on January 23, 'WEDO Influence 2018' will be held on February 6 at TB Rajarathinam Auditorium. The event will have exhibits of franchise business opportunities, trending referral opportunities, new product display and stalls by various brands.
 
 "About 40 women visionaries will also be awarded across 10 different professional categories, including architecture, health and wellness, learning and development, industrial, art, media etc," says Kadambari, adding that women can self-nominate themselves. "The face-to-face interview for the award nominees will be held on January 26 and 27," she says.
