 ‘’I didn’t expect to score a 100 percentile and was excited when I got to know about it,” said Reddy, who hails from  , Andhra Pradesh. While he didn’t find any significant changes in the paper pattern, he said that the logical reasoning portion was quite tough. Luckily, it is one of his strong points along with Maths which helped him easily crack it.

 An MBA was not part of Reddy’s initial plan when he got into IIT Madras and the switch just happened as he progressed.
 
 Pretty much following the advice of his TIME coaching experts, Reddy practiced mock test papers for three hours daily in a set pattern which helped him crack the test.
 
 When it comes to his next step, Reddy is clear he wants it to be at  , so much so that he may go back to his job offer rather than entering other IIMs. He now hopes to perform well in the upcoming Group Discussion and interview rounds for gaining admission into IIM-A.
