PANAJI: Undergraduate and postgraduate students that   in one or two subjects need not repeat the entire semester to improve their scores from now on.   has amended its ordinances, allowing students, starting from 2017-18, to answer only the papers they failed to clear. 

 Until 2016-17, students had to repeat the   and answer all the papers for the entire semester, which made it difficult for students to improve their scores. 
 
 The new rule is expected to not only benefit failures, but also students who have cleared their graduate and postgraduate exam and only wish to improve their overall pass percentage. “For many positions, like that of lecturers, for instance, only candidates who have scored 55% marks can apply. But if a student scores 54.7%, he or she cannot apply for the position, as rounding up of the percentage is not allowed. The new amendment will benefit such students in terms of employment,” said Goa Univerity registrar Y V Reddy. 
 
 A student can choose one subject and reappear for the exam and by improving their score in the subject, better their overall pass percentage at the graduate and postgraduate level. Those who have opted for the improvement scheme will not be eligible to seek benefit of any ranks and merits on the basis of their new scores.
