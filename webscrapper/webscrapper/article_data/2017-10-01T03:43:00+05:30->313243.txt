Vasco: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar on Saturday evening briefed the locals of Katem, Baina, to make use of the toilet units and not answer nature’s call in the open. Parrikar was speaking during the inauguration of 20MLD sewage treatment plant at Katem, Baina. “The state government will provided all the necessary infrastructure to the public. If toilet units aren’t there, then we shall build them. But, cleanliness has to be given importance,” Parrikar said, adding that it will take more than two to three months for the plant to become operational. Pointing out to the Baina flyover overlooking the sewage treatment plant, he said, “We had to fight to make sure that locals get access to the beach, so we had to approach the high court to get the flyover done. The BJP government is here for people’s development and the public shouldn’t listen to those who talk nonsense about our style of working”.  PWD minister Sudin Dhawalikar said, “Earlier, Mormugao would get 55MLD of water, but now it receives around 67 MLD. Next month, we will inaugurate the new water pipeline which will provide additional 15 MLD of water to the port town. Besides this, low lying areas such as Chicalim will get new connections.” The newly-inaugurated plant was constructed at the cost of Rs 3.87 crore.  The key feature is its 500KW capacity with 1560 photo voltaic panels mounted on GI structure.  Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida requested Parrikar to upgrade the pumping station in Vasco.
