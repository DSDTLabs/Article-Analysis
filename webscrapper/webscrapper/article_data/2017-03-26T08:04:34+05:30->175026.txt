HYDERABAD: Jayshankar-Bhupalapally district collector A  , who made controversial remarks about Brahmins and their religious beliefs and urged people to break the law and kill wild boar, got an earful from chief secretary S P Singh. The CS is learnt to have called for an explanation from the collector on his comments on Brahmins and hunting of wild animals. 

 Meanwhile, forests and environment minister   announced in the   that an inquiry has been ordered and appropriate action will be taken against the collector for 'exhorting' people to hunt wild boars.
 
 A top government official said: "the collector was admonished verbally and he expressed regret." It may be recalled that on Friday, Murali, addressing a gathering at   village in the district, repeatedly referred to Brahmins in a derogatory manner and taunted people observing 'deekshas'.
 
 "This was unacceptable behaviour from a responsible officer," the official added.
 
 However, the collector may still not be out of the woods. A senior wildlife department official said if anyone caught killing a wild boar or with its meat citing the collector's exhortation, then Murali would become an abettor in the crime and would have to face punishment as per provisions in the law.
 
 Murali has also been given a quick lesson in rules governing hunting of wild boar and a letter was also sent to him from the office of the principal chief conservator of forests here on that matter, the official said.
