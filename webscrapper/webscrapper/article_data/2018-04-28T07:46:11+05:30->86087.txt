KOCHI: Thrikkakara police on Friday arrested two top officials of a food products company on charges of helping another city-based distributor for selling expired baby food products.

 The arrested have been identified as G K Menon, South India general manager of Continental Milkose (India) Ltd, and K R  , the Kerala sales manager of the company.
 
 “The accused used to supply packets to the distributor Shivasubhramanian,” said Thrikkakara   P P Shams.
 
 Police had arrested the distributor, a native of Vattavila in Thiruvananthapuram, after finding that expired baby food products were supplied by him after tampering with the expiry date.
 
 The distributor was nabbed by a police team from Chennai on Tuesday night. His arrest was recorded at the ACP office on Wednesday morning. Police have registered a case under sections 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property).
 
 Earlier, councillors had visited the godown and found evidence of repacking of items leading to the police registering a case.
 
 
  The Kalamassery police probing the incident in which a threemonth-old baby was found abandoned at a mosque near   is scrutinising the details of deliveries that happened in hospitals in the nearby area.
 
 The probe is now based on the data collected from hospitals as the search for a   footage from the area is yet to yield any results.
 
 “We are conducting a thorough search to identify the parents and those who abandoned the baby. The baby girl is now under the protection of the child welfare committee,” said S Jayakrishnan, Kalamassery CI.
 
 The committee chairperson, Padmaja Nair, said that the child is in safe hands.
 
 “We will try to find the mother. If we are unable to do so, then we will think about further cause of action,” said the   chairperson.
