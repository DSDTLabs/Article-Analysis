Mumbai: Entertainment Network (India) Ltd, the operator of India’s No. 1 FM radio channel  , on Tuesday said it posted strong growth despite heavy   headwinds during the quarter and year ended March 31, 2017. For the January-March quarter, it posted growth of 18.6% in operating revenues at Rs 162.3 crore. After considering other operating income, growth was 12.4% at Rs 165.5 crore. 

 The company, which operates FM radio broadcasting stations through the Radio Mirchi brand in 40 Indian cities, reported an operating   of Rs 35.2 crore and   of Rs 13.8 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 — both lower because of the impact of demonetisation and investments in phase-3 stations.
 
 For the full year ended March 31, 2017, operating revenue grew by 11.6% to Rs 549.5 crore as against Rs 492.1 crore in FY16. Total revenues, including other operating income, rose 9.4% from Rs 508.6 crore to Rs 556.5 crore. The company reported an operating ebitda of Rs 125.9 crore and PAT of Rs 54.5 crore for FY17 — both lower because of reasons similar to those for Q4FY17.
 
 Commenting on the results, Prashant Panday, MD & CEO,  , said that demonetisation had hit the media industry adversely in Q4FY17. “ENIL’s core radio business was also impacted. However, our strong non-radio businesses and new phase-3 stations helped us post strong revenue growth. Ebitda and PAT were impacted by demonetisation and continuing investments in brand building for new stations. What is extremely satisfying is that our new stations are doing extremely well, both in listenership and revenues.”
