AHMEDABAD: Amrut  , the parent of a boy who was granted admission in class 1 in an English-medium private school, complained of non-cooperation by school authorities in granting admission under the Right To Education (RTE) Act.

 Dataniya told mediapersons: “School authorities asked me to teach my son how to read and write 1-2,000 and then bring him to the school for admission.”
 
  Dataniya’s son has been granted admission in Divine Child School in Vasna. Dataniya was one of the 200-odd parents who had come to the   (DEO) to complain about the apathy being demonstrated by many private schools in granting admission to poor children under the RTE Act.
 
 About 25% of seats of all schools are reserved for admission for poor children under the RTE Act. This year, 80,000 admissions have been granted in private schools across   under the Act.
 
    said that an inquiry will be conducted in the Dataniya’s case.
 
 Meanwhile, many other parents complained that schools were being rigid and apathetic towards poor parents. Savita, for instance, said that her daughter was denied admission by a leading school as she was 1.5 months short of the eligibile age of six.
 
 At least 12 complaints of schools not giving admission in the medium of instruction requested, school being far away from home, and other issues have been received at the 41 receiving centers opened to facilitate document verification.
 
 Vanita Srimali, the grandmother of Sakshi Srimali, said that a school had asked them to pay up Rs 5,000 towards books and fee as the government had paid only Rs 10,000 of the total Rs 15,000 fee.
