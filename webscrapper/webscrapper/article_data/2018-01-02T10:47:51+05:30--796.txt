MUMBAI:   has cut its   benchmark by 30 basis points to 8.65 per cent. It has, however, not made any changes in its current benchmark-—the marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR). 

 The base rate cut will benefit those borrowers who had raised floating rate loans, including home loans, before April 2016. While many loan borrowers had refinanced their mortgages under the MCLR regime, there are 80 lakh borrowers whose loans are still linked to the base rate. Besides the base rate, the bank has also reduced its prime lending rate ( ), an even older benchmark, to 13.40 per cent to 13.70 per cent.
 
 SBI has also extended its ongoing waiver of home loan processing fees till March 31, 2018. This will be applicable for new customers buying a house and others looking to switch their existing loans to SBI. With this reduction, SBI’s base rate is the lowest among all lenders. The advantage for SBI is that with this reduction its older borrowers now do not have the same incentive to get their loans refinanced from other borrowers. 
 
 P K  , managing director, retail and digital banking, SBI said, “The reduction in base rate is a new year gift to the bank’s loyal customers as a large number of consumers who have their loans linked to the base rate will be benefited. This reduction is part of the bank’s efforts to ensure transmission of reduction in the policy rates in the recent past.
 
 Approximately 80 lakh customers will gain from this move." SBI’s rates range from 7.70 per cent for overnight borrowing to 8.10 per cent for three years. The bank’s cheapest home loans are currently available at 8.35 per cent and are linked to one-year MCLR. 
 
 There is a likelihood that the MCLR will also be replaced by an external benchmark similar to   in global markets. In October 2017, an RBI panel had suggested that banks link lending rates to an external benchmark to hasten policy transmission.
