 FC’s stay in Goa for the last eight days reminds their coach   of what Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger famously said.
 
  “If you fail to prepare, prepare to fail,” Grant reminded TOI of Wenger’s words, seated comfortably in the lobby of a hotel in Calangute and sipping coffee.
  
  The former   FC manager who guided the London giants to the final of UEFA Champions League in 2008 knows all about preparations; he’s been a successful manager with stints with three English Premier League clubs and knows that any mismanagement with the training schedule can make a world of difference to the team’s chances.
  
  “It was not my idea (to come to Goa early). I am trying to adjust to what’s happening with  . They told me when you play two games away, you don’t come back (home). To be honest, I am not happy but I understand the idea behind this. If I knew this is the facility, I would have insisted we train at home,” said Grant, who arrived with the team in Goa immediately after their clash against Bengaluru FC on January 26.
  
  NorthEast United were based in Calangute for the first four days of their stay and struggled to find a training venue of their choice. They were put up just adjacent to the Poriat ground but the ground was not good enough to train. They trained at the Sesa Football Academy ground in Sirsaim one day, Dempo ground in Old Goa the next day and then settled for the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim.
  
  The constant and long travel hampered preparations. Sources said there were a couple of injuries too and Grant looked bemused when on his way to training, the team bus was halted for more than 15 minutes at a railway crossing.
  “This is all part of the development. I spoke to the owner and he understands. We are all learning. The people here at this club want to learn and improve,” said Grant.
