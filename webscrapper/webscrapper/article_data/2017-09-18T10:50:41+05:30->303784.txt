NAGPUR: Kalyani Goutele, who turned 16 on September 16, ended her life on the same day by hanging from the ceiling rafter at her residence at   in  . She was an only child, born 32 years after her parents’ marriage.

 Ironically, Kalyani’s post mortem was conducted on Sunday at Mayo Hospital, where her father Hasnu had worked in the autopsy section of the forensic department for several years before being transferred to Yavatmal. Hasnu, who was on leave, had gone out when his daughter ended her life. She was a student of standard X.
 
 Kalyani’s mother Geeta, also a   worker, said that she had gone to her daughter’s tuition class at Vaishali Nagar to consult her about the birthday cake. “My daughter panicked on seeing me at the tuition class. She assumed I would reveal her friendship with a boy to her father, who may punish her on hearing about the affair,” said Geeta. “She returned home and hanged herself before I could come back from her tuition class,” Geeta said.
 
 A case of accidental death has been registered at   police station.
