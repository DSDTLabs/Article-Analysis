NEW DELHI:   IndiGo reported a profit of Rs 762 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, up 56.4% compared to Rs 487.3 crore in same period in last financial year. Airline’s president Aditya   said while it remained “interested in acquiring the international operations of  , we will explore the long-haul opportunity with or without AI. In that context, we will start seeking route rights and other necessary regulatory approvals as may be required to operate long-haul flights.”

 IndiGo is so far the only player to give a formal expression of interest to the government for AI’s airline business. “While the government has made certain announcements relating to the privatization of Air India, we are still awaiting details of the process,” Ghosh said.
 
 In Q3, IndiGo’s revenue from operations rose 24% to Rs 6,177 crore from Rs 4,986 crore in the same period last year.
 
 The increased profit, Ghosh said,“was due to better revenue management as well as credits received from our manufacturers. We also had several operational milestones during
 
 the quarter. We became the first Indian carrier to cross 1,000 daily flights… we carried our 20th crore customer. These achievements have come within a period of just 11 years of our operations.… We also inducted our first   72-600 aircraft during the quarter.…”
 
 IndiGo, which currently has a fleet of 153 planes, had total cash Rs 13,887 crore at the end of December 2017. Clearly, its war chest for starting long-haul international operations is ready for either acquiring AI’s airline arm or doing so organically.
