KOLKATA: The mercury has been on a   this week and with no systems in sight,  . Even though a lowpressure trough exists in the north Bengal-Assam region, it is too far away to have an impact on the city weather, felt meteorologists.

 The city's maximum temperature could touch 35°C on Friday. North Bengal, however, is set to be lashed by a thunderstorm and could remain cool. On Thursday , Kolkata recorded a maximum temperature of 34.6°C.
 
 “The last two weeks have been pleasant due to the thundershowers that struck in succession. But with the squalls disappearing, there is nothing to keep the mercury in check any more. It will get progressively warmer and the maximum temperature could remain stable at 34-35°C over the next few days,“ said G K Das, director, Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC).
 
 This has been Kolkata's wettest March in a decade. With three thundershowers and two squalls, the maximum temperature has remained below 32°C. Kolkata normally has four wet days in March, but it has been fewer in recent years. This time, the city has already had five rai ny days. But it was not a squall every time. A storm accompanied by wind at a speed of at least 45 km hr qualifies as a squall.
 
 “We had squalls on March 10 and 11. The rest have been thundershowers. It has pushed the mercury down,“ added Das.
 
 The Met office predicts a two-degree rise in maximum temperature on March 25. On Saturday , the maximum temperature could touch 36°C, which would be the highest of the season so far. Friday is set to be a degree cooler. The maximum temperature could remain steady at 35°C till March 28.
 
 But there could be an interim relief.
 
 Moderate rain and thunderstorms are predicted on March 26 and 27. “But the rain could be light and the relief would be short-lived,“ said Das.
