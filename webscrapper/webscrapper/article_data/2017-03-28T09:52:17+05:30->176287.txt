 “Parents were afraid of social stigma. So, they did not persue the case with a specialized doctor. However, as the boy became a teenager his voice became like that of a man. Also, his behaviour was also like a male. So, they visited a specialist in 2012,” said Dr  . 
 
 “We operated on the boy four times in three years to release his male organ. He is now a male with all normal internal and external characters,” said Dr Jain.
