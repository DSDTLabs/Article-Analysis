JAIPUR: The Jaipur police busted a major inter-state ATM fraud gang and arrested five of its members who duped people by swapping their debit cards with fake ones to later fraudulently withdraw money from their accounts. A total of 94 debit cards have been recovered from their possession.

 The incident came to light when Vaishali Nagar police got a whiff of a gang from Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh roaming near ATM kiosks to target gullible ATM users.
 
 
 A special team arrested the five accused from Chitrakoot area in the wee hours of Sunday. The accused have been identified as Mohammad Tayyab (20), a resident of Ghaziabad; Nasim
 
 (22), a resident of Najafgarh; Azad (23), a resident of Ghaziabad; Aamir (23), also a resident of Ghaziabad, and Saaud (25), a resident of Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 According Vaishali Nagar SHO Bhopal Singh, the gang preyed on gullible users. They used to enter ATM kiosks along with the target, lure him into conversation and swap his card with a fake one.
 
 “They used to search for their targets outside ATMs. Once they zeroed in on their potential victim, they used to enter the kiosk with him. They would do some kind of tampering due to which the ATM would cancel all transactions, meanwhile one of them would silently note down the debit card’s password,” Singh said, adding that the gang members would offer to help the victim and swap his debit card with a fake one.
 
 Later, the gang would make unauthorised transactions from different ATMs from different cities. “We have seized 94 ATM cards from them. Initial investigation indicates the gang’s involvement in over 200 such frauds across the country,” Singh said, adding that the gang was active in Ajmer, Bewar, Uttar Pradesh, New Delhi and Haryana.
 
 The Jaipur police suspect that the gang has withdrawn lakh of rupees from multiple accounts. “Their involvement in more than 200 cases of ATM fraud has come to light. We are currently probing into their criminal past,” Singh said.
