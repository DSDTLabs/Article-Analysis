PANAJI: Despite a sharp revision in berthing and handling charges for cruise vessels, Mormugao Port Trust saw a reduction in the number of arrivals with   reporting that 30 cruise liners visited the port in the current tourism season. MPT had projected that 40 cruise vessels would berth at Goa in the current tourism season as compared to the 39 ocean going passenger vessels that docked at MPT in 2016-17.

 The last luxury cruise vessel for the season, MV Seven Seas Voyager, docked at the port on May 5 with 600 guests and 450 crew members. The vessel arrived from   and departed the same day for Mumbai.
 
 The luxury cruise liner season began on November 14 with the arrival of the cruise ship MV Nautica. MPT plans that by 2022, 100 cruise vessels should visit Mormugao port of which a sizeable number will be domestic cruises.
 
 To attract more cruise vessels and promote cruise tourism, MPT has introduced concessional tariff, even at the cost of incurring a loss of about Rs 10 crore, a port official said.
 
 MPT has also taken efforts to improve logistic support for the luxury vessels and has provided extra facilities at the terminal. The setting up of immigration counters at the terminal for faster immigration clearances, e-visa facilities and pre-paid tourists taxi counters have helped improve the experience for tourists arriving at MPT.
 
 “This was done in order to attract more cruise liners and also as a part of its contribution towards promoting tourism in the state. The arrival of cruise ships with thousands of guests and an equal number of crew translates into steady revenue earnings for the state in foreign exchange as well as earnings to all stakeholders connected with cruise tourism,” a port official said.
 
  Among the many stakeholders who draw direct benefits are luxury coach operators and tourist taxis.
