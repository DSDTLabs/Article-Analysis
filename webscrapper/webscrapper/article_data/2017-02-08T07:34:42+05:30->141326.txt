 The teams of ATS began zeroing in on 'Travel Haq' and traced Muhammad Iqbal, a resident of Mylapore in Chennai. Sleuths of ATS knew the movements of Iqbal and sent a team to Chennai.
 
 "He was coming back to Chennai via Andhra Pradesh with gold which he had smuggled from Myanmar. We informed our sister agencies in Tamil Nadu and they apprehended Iqbal with illegal gold. The DRI registered a case against him and arrested him," Kumar said.
 
 The ATS officials said they had first found the alleged links between Iqbal and IS when Jameel told interrogators that he had received funds form one 'Travel Haq' who was located in South India.
 
 "Iqbal had contacted IS commanders through social networking sites like Kick. The IS told him to get in touch with Jameel Ahmed who was already providing funds to IS in Iraq and Syria through his hawala network in Lebnon and Dubai," an ATS official said.
