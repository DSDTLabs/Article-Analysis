NOIDA: Vehicular congestion at the Sector 18 market complex is likely to stay for another three months,   officials said on Friday. The multilevel parking plan, which was drawn up to decongest the shopping complex is likely to be ready only by   this year. The project was slated to be ready by the end of June, according to state industries minister Satish Mahana after his review in May, but is now chasing a new deadline.

 According to officials, the facility is now 87% complete. “We are fast tracking the project considering the dire need for the facility in the gridlocked commercial area,” said S C Mishra, nodal officer and project engineer for the project, adding, “Once this facility is ready, we will not allow any vehicles to park along the streets of the market complex. Nearly 2,000-2,500 vehicles park in the sector daily. Our facility has a capacity to house more than 3,000 vehicles. This will ensure de-congestion in the badly gridlocked area.”
 
 Being developed opposite Hotel Radisson, the facility is proposed to have manual parking based on ramps. The School of Design and Architecture, Delhi, has prepared the design for the multi-level parking. Work on the facility commenced in July 2013. The multi-level parking facility is proposed to house six floors including two basements. Once complete, a total of 3,085 vehicles will be able to park at the facility.
