He has six goals and four assists to his name and feels that it is Minerva Punjab's title to lose.

What matters is that the team should do well and win. I am not going after personal glory. I believe this is the year of Minerva to lift the title. We have shown our mettle so far and I'm sure we will be the ones to get our hands on the trophy," Chencho, who scored a goal against   on Tuesday, said.

"Initially we were trying to understand each other's playing style but we adapted quickly and developed a great understanding and the results are for all to see.
