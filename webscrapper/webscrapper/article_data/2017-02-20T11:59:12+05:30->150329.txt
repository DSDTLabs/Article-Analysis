 James   has revealed that he stayed at   veteran Carrie  's home while recording his first album 'Back to Bedlam'. 

  
  
 The 42-year-old British singer opened up about his special relationship with the 'Star Wars' actress, who died December 27, four days after suffering a cardiac episode aboard an airplane. 
 
 He recalled recording his hit 'Goodbye My Lover' using a piano in Fisher's bathroom and Debbie Reynolds, who passed away at age 84 just one day after her daughter, steering clear of him unless she had applied a full face of makeup. 
 
 Blunt said the name of his 2004 debut album was influenced by the experience because he "lived in a madhouse with her." And while staying at her  , Blunt also experienced something very strange as he said Fisher even made an eerie prediction about her own death at the time. 
 
 "She put a cardboard cutout of herself as Leia outside my room, with her date of birth and date of death on her forehead. I'm trying to remember what the date was, because it was around now and I remember thinking it was too soon."
