CHANDIGARH: A senior editor of a book widely considered the ' ', has alleged that an Indian author has plagiarised some 40 images in his own work. This has sparked a major debate in the medical fraternity.

 
 Dr Vinay Kumar, distinguished service professor and chairman emeritus of the pathology department at  , has accused Dr Vinay Kamal of copying images from 'Robbins and Cotran, Pathologic Basis of Disease' in his 'Text Book of Pathology'.
 
 Kamal, who was formerly at Maulana Azad Medical College in New Delhi, recently published his book with   and Distributor, New Delhi. Kumar has already informed his publisher, Elsevier, about his allegation.
 
  
  
 Kamal refuted the charges and said, "I have over 1,500 images as compared to 1,100 images of the Robbins book and none are plagiarised. Three images are similar which can be redone in case my publishers ask me. I have been able to sell 7,000 copies in last nine months and this is worrying the author."
 
 S K Verma, CBS' marketing and operations vice-president, said, "There is no issue between Elsevier and us on this subject."  , spokesperson for Elsevier at their headquarters in New York, told TOI, "Elsevier takes plagiarism and copyright infringements very seriously and we defend against infringements whenever and wherever we discover them. We are working with CBS and hope to resolve this matter swiftly."
 
 Kumar alleged, "Quite surprisingly copying is from the eighth edition (2010) and not from the current ninth edition (2014); perhaps it was thought that no one would check one of our older editions. The copied figures are identical except for some cosmetic changes in colours and shapes of cells. All the labels are the same and the processes are depicted in exactly the same manner. No permission was requested for use of these figures and there is no acknowledgement of the source."
