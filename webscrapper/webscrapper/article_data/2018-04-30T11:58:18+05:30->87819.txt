HYDERABAD: Two days after a mystery fire destroyed 200 metres buffer zone of the   Lake area, angry activists said the bio-diversity of the lake was being destroyed and the culprits are still at large.

 
 “The area is home to pythons and monitor lizards,” said   of Dhruvansh, an NGO working for the protection and conservation of the lake.

 This is not the first instance of mystery fires starting near a lake. Earlier, garbage burning was also reported in   and a water body located inside Golconda fort.
 
 Residents staying in the vicinity of Neknampur lake, thought the fire was extinguished and left the place late on Thursday evening, but the fire spread deep into the buffer zone and was burning till next morning. The entire fire was extinguished around 7am after panchayat officials roped in tankers on Friday.
 
 While panchayat officials said the fire was due to burning of garbage, locals in the area said that patta owners whose land falls in the buffer zone started the fire.
 
 State government has sanctioned Rs 22 crore for development of the Neknampur Lake.
 
 Pointing towards the amount sanctioned, residents of Neknampur said the patta owners want to fence their land before the restoration work starts. “The patta owners have burnt the trees instead of clearing them to save money,” said a resident of Neknampur, on conditions of anonymity.
 
 Officials of the local gram panchayat said the fire could been caused by workers burning garbage and admitted receiving a call late in the evening about the fire.“I assume the fire might have been caused by some construction workers burning garbage,” said   secretary of   gram panchayat.
