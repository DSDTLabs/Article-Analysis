Patiala: The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has decided to periodically measure   at toll plazas during peak hours in the state. It has also asked project directors of privately-managed national and state highways in the state to initiate measures as per their concession agreements to control dust pollution on roads. 
 
 The PPCB chairperson, K S Pannu, has asked the companies to ensure that proper plantation on the central verge and on both sides of the roads was done and maintained. He said it was observed that although the agreement of the road constructing companies includes developing a green cover on the central verge and the sides of the roads, they were found lacking in undertaking the job. 
  
 The PPCB chairman said that the board officials had recently submitted a report in which dust being thrown in air by vehicles using highways was found to be a major pollutant, especially during the winter season. He said the board had also asked the private companies to make certain that measures to collect dust from roads was put in place. The non-concrete paths between the overbridge and the service lanes were another major dust spots, which were not being properly maintained by the road constructing companies, resulting in air pollution. 
  
 Pannu said the PPCB would keep a constant watch to ensure that the directions given to the highway authorities were followed in letter and spirit.
