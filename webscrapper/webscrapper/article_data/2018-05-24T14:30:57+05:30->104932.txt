TRICHY: The 1343 birth anniversary of the Perumbidugu Mutharaiyar went off peacefully with the local leaders cutting across party lines and garlanding the statue in the city on Wednesday.

 The celebrations commenced with two state ministers Vellamandi M   and S   and several other leaders from the   as well as the Mutharaiyar community associations garlanding the statue on Wednesday morning.
 
 Since the district administration organised the celebration, district collector  , AIADMK MPs P Kumar, T Rathinavel, and MLAs participated in the celebrations and garlanded the statue of the king.
 
  deputy general secretary TTV Dhinakaranâ€™s visit with his supporters created some ruckus at the venue as his men entered into arguments with the police. The arguments erupted after the police refused to allow his van to be parked near the police outpost. His supporters left after raising slogans against the police. Dhinakaran also garlanded the statue and left after addressing the press.
