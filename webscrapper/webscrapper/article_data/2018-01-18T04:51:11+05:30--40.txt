MUMBAI: Two   filed a public interest litigation before the   to seek postponement of the first semester examination which is to commence January 29, as admissions had concluded only last month. The plea is whether the university can reduce a   to a 17-day one.

 The PIL was mentioned before a bench of Justices Bhushan Gavai and B P Colabawalla by advocate Kamaljit Singh, citing urgency. The HC posted it for a hearing on Friday.
 
 Sainath Pawar (43) and Sharad Koli (42) said they took admission to first year LLB in the three-year course at Bandra’s   by December 22, which was the last date for extended institutional round LLB-III intake on directions issued by the HC in a petition filed last year. Their case is that they have only 17 working days in the semester, of two lectures each day, each lecture lasting an hour and 40 minutes. They said according to the UGC regulation of 2010 and  , the duration for a semester must be 90 days. The students had written to the university for an extension, but met a blank.
 
 The challenge seeks high court to direct that the semester exam be held only after 90 days from the last date of admission. —Swati Deshpande
