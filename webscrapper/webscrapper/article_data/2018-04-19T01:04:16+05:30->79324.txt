KALYAN: Two unidentified youths, aged between 18 and 20, standing near the door of a local train compartment fell from a height of 40ft into a   near Shahad station on Tuesday morning. While one of them swam to safety, the other drowned.

 Eyewitnesses said passersby who rushed towards the nullah on hearing the   screaming for help, instead of rushing to their aid, started making   of the tragic incident on their phone.
 
 Rameesh Shaikh, a passerby who fished out the drowned youth’s body, told TOI, “I was walking along  , when I heard the screams. I saw one of the youths drowning, and called for help as I entered the nullah to save him. But people were busy making videos of the incident. By the time I managed to get him out of the water, he was already dead.” 
 
 The body has been kept in the morgue at the nearby Rukmini Bai Hospital. The Mahatma Phule police have sent the deceased youth’s photograph to all police stations to help identify him. There were no identification documents on his person. Also, as the other youth immediately left the spot, the police have no leads on him. 
 
 “Prima facie it looks like the two youths, who were standing near the door of the compartment, fell into a nullah as the Central Railway train approached Shahad station between 11.15am and 11.30am on Tuesday. While one of them managed to swim to safety, the other suffered head injuries, fell unconscious and drowned,” said senior inspector Prakash Londe of the Mahatma Phule police station. 
 
 The police are also probing if the two youths were doing stunts on the footboard of the train. They have sought help from the railway police to help identify the two victims.
