Mumbai: The Christian community will observe the 40-day fast and penance of   beginning Wednesday. And this year the Catholic Church has devised a unique   Fast in honour of God’s creation. 

 During Lent, several households or individuals forgo the consumption of non-vegetarian food and liquor, or stop smoking during the Lenten abstinence. The sombre season leads up to Good Friday which was the day Jesus Christ was martyred. The festival of Easter that celebrates his resurrection falls on April 16.
 
 Fr Nigel Barrett, spokesman for the archdiocese of Bombay, said, “The goal of Lent is to sacrifice comforts that we hold dear. We are urging the community to reduce its carbon   to protect and nurture the environment. Using public transport instead of driving a personal vehicle would be a start. Perhaps they could reduce the usage of plastic bags by carrying cloth bags to market. We will offer tips on the archdiocese App and on social media about what people can do in this regard.”
 
  Anslem Alphonso (80) of Mahakali, Andheri, rues how the new generation is slowly moving away from the fast of Lent. “In this age of fast technology, it is tough to even get youngsters to attend Sunday mass. We must remember that once material life is over each of us will be judged in heaven,” he says.
