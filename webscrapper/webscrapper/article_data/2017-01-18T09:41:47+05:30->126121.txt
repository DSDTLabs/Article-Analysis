GUWAHATI: The   and a   have united the Khasis of Meghalaya with the tribals of  . The   has returned to the valley across the   and has brought food,   

 Khasi women have been coming down from the hills of the neighbouring state to exchange their products - especially farm-fresh vegetables - with the residents of villages on the outskirts of the city. In return, they take home with them paddy and pithaguri (pound rice). For the hill-dwellers of Jirang in Ri-bhoi district, paddy is worth its weight in gold. And since demonetisation was announced on November 8, the barter system, too, is no longer just an archaic practice.
 
 Sirin Mawthoh can testify to the benefits of the barter system. She walked down 20km to reach Loharghat to trade her pumpkins and leafy vegetables and found the response on this side of the border to be as heartening as it was 30 years ago.
 
 "A bond of love and affection has kept alive the centuries-old barter system here. I used to come to this area as a young girl in the 1980s. Even after three decades, the enthusiasm among the people remains the same. Locals here eagerly wait for us during the festive season that starts with Magh Bihu," said the Khasi woman.
 
 "The harvesting season has come to an end. We have plenty of rice in our granaries but buying vegetables is a costly affair for us. Apart from being a tradition, the barter system of this festive season helps us stick to our food budget. Their pumpkins and squashes are really tasty," said Junil Rabha, a youth of the Loharghat area.
 
 Apart from trading goods, the guests from Meghalaya are also treated to laroos and pithas by the Loharghat residents. "We never calculate profit or loss while exchanging our goods. Hopefully, this tradition will remain forever," Junil said.
