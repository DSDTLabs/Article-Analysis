 Ahmedabad: The   of Ahmedabad, now inscribed as Unesco World Heritage Site, when seen from above can be seen as a grey patch devoid of any greenery due to its dense pols and little space for gardens. 
 
 “But what about utilizing the space that terraces offer? Or vertical gardens that can be sustained by anyone?” asked Kartikeya Sarabhai, director of Centre for Environment Education ( ).
 
 With this goal in mind, a   was established at historic Shanti Sadan in premises of Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises (ASE), Mirzapur, on Saturday evening in presence of conservationists and pol residents. 
 
 “This nursery has over 100 species of plants specially catering to the old city of Ahmedabad for people to take up greening in their homes and neighbourhoods. People can plant on rooftops, in balconies and in common areas and they have many plants to choose from. The nursery is envisaged as a resource especially to reach out to people in the old city,” said a Shanti Sadan Nursery official.
 
 Sarabhai in his speech mentioned that the century-old campus has carried forward legacy of Maganbhai Karamchand, his great grandfather who was an ardent nature lover. “The premises is also historic as it has hosted Mahatma Gandhi during textile strike and also sown seeds of Jyoti Sangh. We intend to convert it into a space for sharing ideas and hosting events,” he said.
 
 Speakers also elaborated on how many citizens are turning to kitchen gardening to ensure pesticide-free vegetable supply.
