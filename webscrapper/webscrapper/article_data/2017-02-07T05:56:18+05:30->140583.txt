ROHTAK: Under a huge debt due to their habit of gambling, a mason and a labourer from Jind district allegedly hatched a plan to extort money from a cloth merchant by impersonating a gangster on Facebook and then using it to issue threats.

  (26) and Biru Ram (22), who hail from Jind’s Julana village, were arrested on Sunday. Jind superintendent of police (SP)   said on Monday that the accused had told them that a crime-based show on TV inspired them to extort money from  , for whom Rakesh was earlier working as a driver, and had thought that the Facebook profile would mislead the police.
 
 Rakesh and Biru were in the habit of gambling and had lost a lot of money to it, he added. “Both were under pressure from lenders to repay their debts,” the SP said.
 
 The SP said Vijay had lodged a police complaint on January 31, alleging that he had received a phone call to pay the money or he would be killed. The caller introduced himself as  , a gangster active in the area.
 
 The SP said both were caught after they verified details of the mobile phone and the Facebook ID. He said Biru had studied up to Class VIII, while Rakesh had studied till Class XII. The accused were produced in court on Sunday and remanded in police custody for a day.
