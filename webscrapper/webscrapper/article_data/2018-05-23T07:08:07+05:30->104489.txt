 TIRUVANNAMALAI: About 70 kilometres from Tiruvannamalai district headquarters lies   village which has frequently made headlines for all the wrong reasons as many youths from here have been booked on charges of red sanders smuggling.
 
 
 Now, however, two visually impaired siblings have done the village proud by becoming its first graduates. Their family, recently allotted a free green house by the government due to their economic hardships, is seeking appropriate government jobs for the siblings so that they can earn a decent living.
 
 S Saraswathi, 25, and S  , 23, both suffering from 100% visual impairment, have recently completed their bachelor’s degree in English literature, the first from their village to do so. Their parents — C Shekar, 52, and S Radha, 47 — said bringing up a family of five, including two daughters and a son, was especially difficult as their farm failed to give good output. “As agriculture too failed, for a decade or so it was a great ordeal to provide even a square meal to my family,” Shekar said .
 
 Suresh and Saraswathi joined   for the Blind in 2005 from where they completed their bachelor’s degree in English literature.
 
 Saraswathi and Suresh are the first graduates from Sengulam village, which houses more than 500 families. Their family was recently allotted a free green house by the government based on a petition by Suresh to the HR&CE minister  .
 
 More than 200 men from the village are currently in jail after being caught by the Andhra Pradesh Red Sanders Anti-Smuggling task force, a source said.
