CHENNAI: In keeping with the changes that are to be introduced in the   and next year, the school education department is training teachers of different subjects across the state.

 RMSA director S Kannappan said the focus of the training sessions was on concept oriented approach with the existing curriculum that will also prepare teachers for the next academic year when the revised syllabus will kick in. 
 
 Chief education officer Manoharan said the main purpose of the training sessions was to enrich the content for future syllabus and restructure teaching methodology. While two-day training is given to teachers up to Class VIII, tecahers of higher classes will be given five-day training. 
 
 The content of the training also includes NCERT material, said teachers. Other than the basic skills, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving and sensitivity are skills that are being focussed upon as part of the sessions, said T Srimathi, a resource person.
 
 “It is not just about teaching what’s in textbooks, but about incorporating speech mannerisms and references to popular culture as part of the class that may help students get more engaged in the learning process,” she added. 
 
 Meanwhile, an online feedback system has also been constructed, wherein participating teachers will comment on the content, training and interactions of the training sessions.
