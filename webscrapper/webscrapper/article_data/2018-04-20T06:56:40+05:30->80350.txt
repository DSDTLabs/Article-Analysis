BENGALURU: Three days after the earthquake struck Nepal in 2015, Sibu George, a city-based businessman, and Fr   of the NGO Project Hope, visited the country to render whatever assistance they could for victims. One big requirement, they found, was shelter for those who had been rendered homeless.

 Three years on, on April 11 this year, the   and other volunteers under the banner  , constructed and handed over 60 permanent houses to families in Nepal’s   district. Each house, built at a cost of Rs 3 lakh, has been built using stone that suits geographical conditions.
 
 Sibu says the country was a mess when they first landed there. “We personally mobilised money and carried water purifying tablets and essential medicines,” said Sibu. “We found entire villages ruined and the people needed to be rehabilitated. Local markets began operating, but nobody had money to buy anything. Also prices went through the roof.” Fr   recalled the worst affected were mud buildings. “Most school buildings had collapsed, but because it was a Saturday when the earthquake occurred, students were not in school and that’s how they escaped.”
 
 The duo returned to Bengaluru after a week to brainstorm. They formed Bangalore Cares for Nepal and began collecting funds. “We had collected more than Rs 60 lakh when the Indian government announced that Indians cannot directly use the funds to develop Nepal,” Sibu said, adding, “So we transferred the funds to an organisation based in Nepal.”
