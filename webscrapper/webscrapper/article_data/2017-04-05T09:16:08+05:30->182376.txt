HYDERABAD: There was utter chaos at the   on Monday evening and Tuesday morning as the police refused to allow vendors into the stadium because they didn't have the required passes. 

 Sources in the   (HCA) said that the police had refused to allow even those personnel who had temporary passes. The vendors were asked to leave the stadium with their equipment. Even the HCA members/officials had a tough time on Tuesday morning.
 
 It was not until afternoon that things were 'negotiated' between the police and the   and order was restored. Sources said that the police hadn't got their 'share of things' and that's why they were going by the 'rule book'. According to the rules, the police take control of the stadium 48 hours before the match and from that time nobody can enter the premises without a valid pass. However, sources said they had never had any trouble previously but were surprised by the high-handed behaviour of the police this time around.
 
 But the problem also lies in the fact that the Sunrisers' management had failed to get their act together. The defending champions were playing their first game against   on Wednesday and the opening ceremony too was lined up for the day but the   officials were lackadaisical about the whole affair. Sources in the HCA said that the SRH management looked quite disinterested in the whole matter. "The problem is that they don't have any top level guys here and the ones who are managing the affair have to get permissions from Chennai. It is surprising that they haven't shown the necessary alacrity in organising the event. After all it is their show," the source said.
