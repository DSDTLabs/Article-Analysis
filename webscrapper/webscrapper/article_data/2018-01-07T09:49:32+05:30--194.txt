CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh-New Delhi   plying from Chandigarh railway station which was modified under project ‘Swarna’ has coaches which are not vulnerable to fire anymore. There is one executive coach and nine other chair cars in the Shatadbi 12046/12045 which was revamped under the scheme. Under this project, the Indian Railways has taken into consideration 10 key components — punctuality, cleanliness, linen, coach interiors, toilets, catering, staff behaviour, security, entertainment, housekeeping and feedback.

 The railways have incurred a cost of Rs 2.5 lakh for each coach of the new train. The compartment aisle has been marked with fluorescent strips for guidance and safety of passengers which is similar to that of an airliner. The coaches also have refurbished interiors, upgraded toilets and automatic hygiene control systems. Officials said that the changes made in the coaches will not only facilitate hygiene but also be useful in security.   cameras are installed and the number of   (RPF) personnel deployed have been increased under  .
 
 “This is the only Shatadbi which is under the purview of   division as the other two come under Delhi division,” he added.
 
 Dinesh Sharma, divisional railway manager (DRM) of Ambala division said, “This is the first train which is revamped on the guidelines of railway ministry. The division is getting feedback filled by passengers about the new facilities so that improvements can be made accordingly.” He told this while apprising about the facilities in modified Shatabdi under the Swarn (  standard) scheme.
