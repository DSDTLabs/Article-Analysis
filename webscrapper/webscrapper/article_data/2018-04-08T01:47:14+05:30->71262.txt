GURUGRAM: Prohibitory orders banning assembly of five or more people have been imposed in a village in Sohna, following a conflict between two communities.

 The sub-divisional magistrate (Sohna) Friday imposed the orders in   village under   of CrPC till June 6 after a fight took place on March 25 between the Khatiks and the Gujjars over a   in Sohna. The brawl erupted few days after Gujjars protested the cremation of a Khatik man on that ground.
 
 Sources said the   community had raised an objection to the cremation of the Khatik man as the ground was closer to their houses. 
 
 The land belongs to the civic body in Sohna and was earlier used as a cremation ground.
 
 Police said between March 20 and 24, both the communities started talks to resolve the issue and panchayats were also held to discuss the land problem. 
 
 “However, on March 25, around 10-12 Khatik men were allegedly beaten up by the Gujjars after inviting them into their village for resolution talks,” an official said.
 
 An FIR was also registered against them at Sohna city police station, said SHO Ram Kumar.
 
  Later. another FIR was Section 447 (criminal trespass) of IPC after a complaint was lodged by the municipal engineer.
 
 SDM   said prohibitory orders have been issued so that no activities “take place” on the said land. “The demarcation of the land and installation of barbed wires is still in progress. While in the revenue records, it is still a cremation ground, it has been merged with the municipal council land and no cremation has taken place since the 1990s,” he said.
