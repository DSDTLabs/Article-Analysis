SHIMLA:   government schools and colleges would now have biometric time attendance machines to check late entry and early exit of the teachers working in the institutions, said Himachal Pradesh director of higher education B L  .

 Around 3,000 biometric machines from   for 2,648 schools and for 124 colleges have been ordered, said Vinta. With the coming of biometric time attendance machines, teachers would not be able to enter late and leave early from schools and colleges, Vinta directed. “We have already installed the biometric machines in 200 schools and soon all schools and colleges will be covered. With the help of the machines, it will be ensured that teachers take all lectures,” he added.
 
 Apart from making a move to check timely attendance of the teachers, they have also been directed to wear decent clothes in campus, and not use cell phones in classrooms or openly in the premises. Teachers, on the other hand, resent the enforcement of a dress code and installation of the biometric time attendance machines.
