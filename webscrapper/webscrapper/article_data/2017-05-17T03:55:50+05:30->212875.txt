NAGPUR: A woman, in her 50s, tricked 30-year-old Betibai Prajapati at her residence at   in   on May 14 by posing as a ‘spiritually awakened person’ before decamping with her valuables worth Rs18,900, including cash Rs400. An offence has been registered at Wadi   station.

 Police said Betibai was approached by the unidentified woman when she was alone at home. The woman, claiming to possess spiritual power, wanted Betibai to hand her over some rice grains. Posing as if uttering some prayers, the stranger voiced a so-called prophecy stating that Betibai’s son would land in trouble soon. In order to dodge the ill-luck, the woman claimed that she has to perform some rituals for which Betibai’s silver ornaments would be required. After performing some tricks in the name of the rituals, the woman also charged Rs400 as donation for her efforts from Betibai before sneaking away.
 
 Betibai, left bamboozled, had stayed mum for couple of days before her landlord, a doctor, came to know about the incident. The doctor helped Betibai lodge a report.
