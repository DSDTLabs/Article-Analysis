NAGPUR: On one hand, the state government talks about increasing the ease of doing business and on the other, the lower officials are doing their best to harass the industrialists. A shocking case has come to the fore wherein Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation ( ) allotted a plot to an industrialist only to take it away just to provide it to a bigger party.

 Baldev Krishan Ashta, who had come to Nagpur in 2007 with the purpose of setting up an export oriented unit, was given a developed plot in 2013 in MIDC Butibori but two years later, he was asked to move to another one, which had no road access. This was done so that   could be given a larger plot. Ashta has sent a notice to MIDC seeking Rs1.55 crore damages but the agency has not responded so far.
 
 “I had applied for a 4,000 square metre plot in 2007 for setting up a paper stationery unit. I got a 3,800 square metre plot (SZ-36) after a long wait of six years in October 2013. I paid the full demand amount in December 2014 and was preparing to set up my unit there when it was replaced by a plot of equivalent area (SZ-115) in August 2015. This plot had no road access and the injustice was done so that Ceat Tyres could get a bigger plot. My plot was merged into its plot,” Ashta told TOI.
 
 “My dreams were shattered due to exchange of plots. I had a paralytic attack and my son had a heart attack due to the shock. MIDC, particularly joint chief executive officer  , has no regrets for the injustice done to me,” Ashta added.
 
 MIDC regional officer   admitted that Ashta’s plot had been exchanged for helping Ceat Tyres. “Ashta was given the new plot after his consent. There was no pressure on our side. He has already started construction on the new plot. Work on road for linking his plot would start shortly,” he told TOI.
 
 Ashta denies that he willingly agreed for the new plot. “I had no other choice. I have, therefore, claimed damages against MIDC,” the industrialist said.
