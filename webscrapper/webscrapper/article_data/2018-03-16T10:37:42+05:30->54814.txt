 has sported long hair ever since his debut in Bollywood with ‘Heropanti’ in 2014. The actor is now known for his trademark hairstyle and ripped physique. The makers of his latest film ‘
 ’ suggested that he switch it up a bit for a change.

 The trailer of ‘Baaghi 2’ showed Tiger with his hair chopped, looking very different from his usual appearance. Now, Tiger shared a video from the making of ‘Baaghi 2’ and wrote, "I was sad to cut my hair but I guess it’s worth it! Watch my transformation for #Baaghi2 here"
 
 The video shows Tiger Shroff saying that he was against the idea but had to agree as that is what the film’s producer   and director   wanted. The director Ahmed Khan was there by his side as he got his hair cut. Alleged girlfriend and ‘Baaghi 2’ co-star   was also supportive of his courage to change his look.
