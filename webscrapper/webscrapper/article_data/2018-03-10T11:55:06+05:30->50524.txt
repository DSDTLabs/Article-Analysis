JAIPUR : A 23-year-old youth committed suicide while his 24-year-old partner is battling for life after they consumed pesticide in Bagru on the outskirts of Jaipur on Friday. The inter-caste couple, who were married to others, had eloped from their house in   four days ago and reported to have been looking for job in the city. They were found unconscious in a jungle near Bagru on Friday.

 Bhagwan Singh (23) and Sangeeta (24) were rushed to a hospital where Singh could not be saved while Sangeeta’s condition remains critical. The initial investigation suggests that they hailed from   area of Jhalawar where they worked as labourers. According to Bagru SHO Rajendra Singh Shekhawat, both Singh and Sangeeta were married and had children. “Singh had two kids and lived with his wife in the same locality, while Sangeeta was married to a labourer. They had eloped from their house about four days ago,” he said.
 
 The police said that they had been wandering in the city for past many days and found refuge in a locality near a secluded place in Bagru located at the periphery of the city. On Friday early morning, a farmer who was heading to his farms saw the duo in an unconscious state. He informed the police about the incident who then rushed them to the hospital.
 
 While Singh died due to consuming poison, Sangeeta is battling for life. She was able to speak to the police where she said that they had taken a bottle of pesticide from a nearby farm and consumed it early in the morning. The Jaipur police said that they have informed Singh’s relatives about the incident and also called Sangeeta’s husband.
