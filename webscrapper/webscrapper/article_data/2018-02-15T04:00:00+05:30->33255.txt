Mumbai: India’s largest drug company,   reported a 75% drop in net   at Rs 365 crore for the quarter ended December 2017, pulled down by a one-time deferred tax payout in US, reduction in US sales, and a weak performance of its Israeli subsidiary.

 The company’s net profit was adversely impacted by a   of Rs 513 crore related to changes in US tax rates, the company said in a BSE filing. 
 
 The company’s sales at Rs 6,598 crore, showed a de-growth of 14% over the same quarter last year. The decline is primarily driven by the US business, the company said, adding “all other businesses have grown for the quarter”. 
 
 US-finished dosage sales at $328 million were down by 35% over Q3 of the previous year, the reduction partly driven by year-on-year decline in sales of generic Imatinib- and Olmesartan-authorised generics.
 
 Sun Pharma MD   said, “Our Q3 performance reflects a gradual improvement in profitability over the first half of this year, despite a challenging US generic pricing environment.”
