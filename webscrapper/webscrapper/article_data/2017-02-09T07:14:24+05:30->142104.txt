BHUBANESWAR: The state government on Wednesday urged the Centre to converge   ( ), a monthly pension programme with different centrally- sponsored schemes to ensure additional   to the pension scheme beneficiaries. 

 The state government provides monthly pension of Rs 300 and Rs 500 to nearly 20.38 lakh old, widowed, differently-abled and other vulnerable groups like HIV-infected and leprosy patients. 
 
 The state government argued that the NSAP beneficiaries can be provided additional livelihood opportunities under schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), National Rural Livelihood Mission, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDUGKY) and National Rurban Mission.
 
 "Since the pension amount is meagre, they need to be provided with additional livelihood support under different centrally-sponsored schemes for additional income. We have repeatedly urged the Centre to formulate guidelines for converge of NSAP with different schemes," said an officer in the social security department.
