LUCKNOW: After receiving reports of   by many   and of teachers skipping regulars classes, especially in rural areas, the state government wants photographs of teachers put up on attendance registers in schools. The decision comes after the department came across logistic problems in ensuring biometric attendance at every school in the state.

 The directive is to ensure that only the teacher posted in a particular school teaches the student and not a substitute or a   sent by the teacher.   has also launched a scheme under which an MP, MLA or any government official can adopt a school and improve its infrastructure. Basic education minister Anupama Jaiswal said it has been common practice of teachers to go on leave without informing anyone and they either hire teachers or take help of their close colleagues to mark attendance or work on their behalf.
 
 During the review meeting at Agra on Sunday, chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi made similar directives for pictures of teachers to be put up at schools. The minister said bio-metric attendance has not been done away with but since it would take time to install the system and there are bound to be technical problems, photographs of the teachers would be pasted in the attendance registers. 
 
 Emphasising that the situation will improve once every student of primary education is linked with Aadhar and exact number is known, said Jaiswal.
