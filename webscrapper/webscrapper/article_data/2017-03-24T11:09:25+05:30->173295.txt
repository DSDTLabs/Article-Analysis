PANAJI: Minister for art and culture   told mediapersons on Thursday that   will bear the entire cost of the damage to the   building that also houses the directorate of art and culture.

 “Consultation is under way between consultants at   and Gera on the precautionary work that has to be taken up. All aspects have to be taken into consideration and the load stability has to be calculated. Gera has already given their word that they will carry out repairs at their own cost,” he said.
 
 Officials told TOI that repair work has already begun on the building which was recently damaged due to work at the adjacent construction site.
 
 A complaint was filed with the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) as soon as damage to the compound wall was noticed. A site inspection was carried out and the   commissioner held a hearing. “The company was instructed to carry out repair work as well as to provide future stability for the building. Plans for the repair work were submitted to the CCP and these were examined by the structural consultant of GSIDC and accordingly the work began,” a CCP official said. 
 
 “The government is not going to spend a single rupee because it is not our fault,” Gaude said.
