CHANDIGARH: The Supreme Court has upheld the Punjab and   high court verdict of reducing the institutional quota of the Sector-32   ( ) for postgraduate courses in medicine and science (MD/MS) from 100 to 25%.

 
  
 
 This implies that the GMCH must give 25% of its seats to eligible MBBS students of Chandigarh domicile and another 25% to MBBS graduates from the college. The rest of the seats, which are in the central pool, remain untouched. The UT health department had moved the apex court against the high court’s order of doing away with 100% quota in MD/MS for the GMCH graduates. “The arguments continued for over an hour,” a petitioner said. “But the Supreme Court found no reason to overrule the high court.”
 
 The college fills 61 of its 125 seats from the institutional quota, while it has only 50 MBBS students. The admission was through NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test), followed by three counselling sessions. The first counselling started on April 4 after a candidate, Dr  , was found ineligible to apply from the state quota, since she had not graduated from the GMCH. She moved the high court and was allowed to take part in counselling under interim order. While the case was in the high court, some of the students had moved the apex court on May 10. However, the Supreme Court did not consider their case and asked the high court to give a quick decision.
 
 However, when the high court passed a judgment on May 15, favouring 25% institutional quota and 25% state quota, the UT health department, which regulates the GMCH, approached the Supreme Court. For 20 years, the college has followed the institutional quota rule of 61 seats for its graduates. The 11 students from other medical colleges contested this in their petition in the high court. Despite repeated attempts, the GMCH director principal could not be contacted.
