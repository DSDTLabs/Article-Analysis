ROHTAK: Even as community leaders talked to the state government’s panel in Panipat, Jat protesters, including women in large numbers, continued their agitation at   village of Rohtak on Saturday. The protesters kept their eye on the progress report of meeting between the government committee with Jat leaders, led by   (AIJASS) chief Yashpal Malik.

 With colleges being closed over the weekend, a large number of students, who came on motorcycles to Jassia, kept the security forces on tenterhooks. The speakers from the stage had to request the gathering to stay calm and clear the crowded National Highway-71A on which tractor-trailers and and bikes were parked, blocking the traffic movement.
 
 Due to huge crowds on the road, police diverted the traffic away from the side. The bike cavalcade of youths, who started from Sector 6 in Rohtak city for Jassia, also created traffic congestion near   toll plaza. A team of district administration and police force remained deployed on the road to deal with any untoward situation.
 
 Former sarpanch of   village Rajender Tomar announced that their dharna would continue till the community’s seven demands were accepted by the state government. He said the   government should stop testing the nerves of the community by adopting pressure tactics or else they were ready to intensify the stir.
 
 Despite the imposition of Section 144 of CrPC, which prohibits assembly of five or more persons at public places, a convoy of tractor-trailers and motorcycles passed through Rohtak with DJ system belting out songs and protesters shouting slogans of ‘Jat Ekta Zindabad’.
