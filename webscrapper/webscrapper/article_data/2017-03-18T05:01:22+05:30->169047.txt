I would not be surprised if more currency notes are seized in the coming days," said an official, requesting anonymity. 

 The five arrested persons have been identified as Harish Deshnehre, Vipul Jain, Malay Doshi, Kunch Patel and Krishna Kumar Nadar. Deshnehre and Jain are CAs and the rest are into share market trading. The currency reportedly belongs to one Mandar Master. The police are looking for him
 
 According to the police, the two CAs had lent some money to Mandar, who is a Chembur resident. Mandar offered to repay the money in demonetized notes.
