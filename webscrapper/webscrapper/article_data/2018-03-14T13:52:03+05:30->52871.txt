TIRUPUR: Much to her shock and surprise, BJP state president   received a mail last week informing her that she has been successfully enrolled as a member of actor-turned-politician   Haasan’s   (MNM). 

 Revealing this on the sidelines of a party meeting in the city on Tuesday, Tamilisai slammed online cadre mobilization of MNM without his/her consent. 
 
 “Kamal Haasan’s party had sent an email to me informing that I was enrolled as a member of it,” she said. It is said in the email: “Thanks for joining as member.   (You and me became us). Your membership number is TNDOF92829.” 
 
 Showing the mail to reporters in her tablet, Tamilisai quipped, “Naanga Naangalaga Thaan Iruppom, Neengal Solvathu Pol Aagamattom (We will remain us we are and will not become as you wished).” 
 
 “I have received the email a week ago. They are sending such message to whichever email IDs they get. They have enrolled BJP state president as their member. If they were running the party blatantly, what can I say,” she laughed.
 
 At the end of the news conference, Tamilisai gave her tablet to one of her party functionaries to show the email which she had received from MNM. When some press photographers asked her to hold the tablet, she sarcastically replied, “I wouldn’t even touch it.”
 
 Meanwhile, MNM replied in its official twitter handle that “Tamilisai has applied to join their party and they have evidences to prove that the application was sent through her website.”
 
 “We did not want show ‘film’ as you did. We also have a photo, just like the one you released today. Just that we are blurring out your number. Don’t want the world calling you to ask how you registered for MNM,” it said.
 
 The twitter handle further said, “By the way, we also have a deregistering option, just in case this has embarrassed you in front of your party. We wouldn’t want that for you. But for the time being, Welcome to MNM.”
