TRICHY: Poverty should not dispirit first generation learners in the current higher education scenario as there are a lot of opportunities in the form of meritorious scholarship offered within the country and overseas, said vice-chancellor of   K Baskar.

 He was delivering the convocation address at St Joseph's College, Trichy on Sunday. The V-C said that students must have the urge to actualize their dreams.
 
 Citing his own example as a student hailing from a middle class family, who went on to realize his dream of pursuing post-doctoral research by availing meritorious scholarships awarded by various government agencies including the   (UGC). 
 
 "Almost all the European countries render higher education scholarships, especially for Asian students," he said.
 
 A sound mind and body with indomitable positive energy will lead to excellence and success in academic pursuits, he said, while adding that students must have a holistic approach to successfully confront the challenges of this century.
 
 The V-C said that any graduate, whatever be the subject, should know the basics of science and arts. Lack of critical thinking, creative zeal and innovative spirit among students, he said, is resulting in evidently low placements. This is despite a large number of students entering into higher education in Tamil Nadu. 
 
 He urged students to keep themselves updated about the latest developments and asked them to promote energy efficient technology to help check global warming. 
 
 A total of 1,653 students, including 30 university rank-holders from St Joseph's College, received degrees at the convocation.
