AMRITSAR: A large number of people came out in support of Sikh Canadian defense minister Harjit Sajjan after a video surfaced showing him not respecting basic civic rules. In the video Sajjan is seen eating cherries while sitting in his car and throwing the pits on the road. This upset a man, presumed to be a shop owner, who made the video and even reprimanded the minister.

 The video which is viral on social media, shows Sajjan perplexed after the man approached him, sitting in the driver’s seat, and rudely asking, “Who are you?” Sajjan replies, “I had come to the meat shop.”
 
 The man further says, “You are a big officer, I know you, I am recording everything. Who made you such a big officer?” Sajjan tries to reply to the agitated man but he just refuses to listen and says, “You are eating cherries and throwing pits on the floor. Who made you this big officer?”
 
 Instead of attracting trolls, the video only brought out Sajjan’s supporters especially in the Indian community who felt the shop-keeper had overreacted. “It is a small mistake by the minister. Everyone makes such type of mistakes but the reaction by the shop owner is huge and is condemnable,” writes   in his comment posted on social media.
 
 Another Facebooker, Palam Manes, wrote, “Oh think that was so hilarious, head of Nato forces caught throwing pits.   if that was peanuts, would have been more funny… Give that guy some space he got nukes under his command and he looked so innocent and completely ducked.”
 
 When the video went viral, another picture was posted on social media with Sajjan flanked by a crowd of Sikhs in front of a gurdwara with cherries in their hands.
 
  writes in her post, “First of all, just look at the video and you can tell Sajjan wasn’t throwing the seed being rowdy, he was enjoying the fruit and absent-mindedly throwing the seeds. This ***** decided to play superman and record the video and then despite his s**t language, Sajjan was so humble.”
