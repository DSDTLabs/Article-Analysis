 The actress recently shot two songs for the movie which were retained from the original, ' ' and ' '. "It was so much fun shooting 'Oonchi Hai Building' and 'Tan Tana Tan', I didn't want the shoot to end.

 Pannu said if not a movie star, she would've loved to be a sports personality as she admires them a lot. "I feel if I had gotten a chance or had some sports skills, I would've definitely tried to be a sports star instead of an actor. I am a sports lover and admire it very much, because the way they play under pressure, with no retakes, representing the country, all of them are big heroes for me."
