 It took nearly five hours from 11 am to clear the road. “We have removed the   as it will obstruct the free flow of water in the riverbed,” said executive engineer (EE) of PWD Anbarasu. He added that the riverbed has been witnessing water flow in the last one month and half months following heavy rains in the upper Palar basin and the catchment area of Palar in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.
