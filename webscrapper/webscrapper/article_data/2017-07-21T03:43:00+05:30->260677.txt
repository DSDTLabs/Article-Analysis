Porvorim: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar told the Goa legislative assembly on Wednesday that casinos have contributed to the state’s economy by way of revenue and employment generation.

 “Yes, by way of revenue generation to the state exchequer and enhancing the tourism sector,” Parrikar said in a written reply to the question tabled by opposition leader Chandrakant Kavlekar.
 
 Kavlekar had sought to know the contribution by casinos and related business’ to the state’s economy. Currently, five offshore casinos and 10 land-based casinos are operating in Goa. 
 
 With regard to MV Lucky Seven, owned by Golden Globe Hotels Private Limited (GGHPL) to be used as an offshore casino, but which ran aground at Miramar on Sunday after it tried to sail into River Mandovi despite rough weather, Parrikar said, “The matter of Golden Globe Hotels Private Limited is under process before this department as per order of the high court of Bombay at Goa”.
 
 Replying to a supplementary query by the opposition leader about how long the government intends to permit casinos in the state, Parrikar said, “The permission for installation of machines for games of electronic amusement/slot machines/table games are issued as per the provisions of the Goa, Daman and Diu Public Gambling Act, 1976. As such, any further decision in this regard will depend on a policy decision of the state government.”
 
 The chief minister also answered in the negative when asked whether the crime rate had increased due to casino operations. On the contrary, crimes declined since 2014, he said. 
 
 The government has come under severe criticism after the sixth floating casino was set to begin operations in River Mandovi, while the government has justified its decision citing the high court’s directive. 
 
 Deputy speaker and BJP’s Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, had on Wednesday tweeted, ‘Government doesn’t want a sixth offshore casino, it should operate on land’.
