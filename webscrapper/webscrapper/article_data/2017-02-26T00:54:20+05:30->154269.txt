Mumbai: A   court on Thursday rejected the   plea of a   who is accused of forcing a woman to take an   pill at the behest of her husband and in-laws, and a doctor. 

 While stating that the hospital nurse, Rubina Korlekar, appeared to be a prime accused in the case, the   observed, “The incidence in question might be one in a series of several such acts by the accused in collusion with the concerned doctor and also with the victim’s husband in this particular case.”
 
 The victim, who was 17 weeks pregnant at that time, lodged a complaint with the Wadala T T police station. She alleged that her husband, Irshad Haq, used to harass her for money and when he found out that she was pregnant, he repeatedly assaulted her and demanded that she go in for an abortion.
 
 While opposing the nurse’s bail plea, the prosecution told the court that on December 4, 2016, she was taken to   on Antop Hill where the nurse gave her the abortion pill without her consent. The prosecution further alleged that the nurse even kept the victim under observation throughout to ensure that the abortion takes place. It said the nurse then kept the aborted foetus on a tray and threw it into a creek and that she had even forged hospital records to show that the victim was only treated for fever and a stomach ache on December 3, 2016, and discharged the same day against medical advice, as her husband had no money to pay for the deposit. There was no mention of the abortion in the hospital records and she had also forged the victim’s signature on the hospital admission paper. Investigations revealed that the nurse had allegedly facilitated the abortion as directed by Dr Gazi Shaikh.
 
 The prosecution said that the call data records showed that the nurse was in touch with her husband who had ordered the abortion. Investigations also revealed that the hospital had unaccounted money totalling Rs 14,000.
