 and  's upcoming mega budget movie  : Arabikadalinte Simham got off to a grand launch a few days ago in a prominent hotel in Kochi. The movie's producers and businessmen CJ Roy and Santosh Kuruvilla along with Antony Perumbavoor hosted a press meet to announce the period film.

 Director Priyadarshan along with Mohanlal also attended the event. They launched the movie's title as well as showed a few glimpses of what the film will be about. Mohanlal, dressed in white and still in his Odiyan getup, was his usual coy self answering only to the point. However, director Priyadarshan was more forthcoming with the answers and also billing the project on par with international standards.
 
 While the event was put together in Kochi in a moment's notice, those who had gathered were treated to snacks and the usual Priyan-Mohanlal banter that one has come to expect from the duo. Antony was in high spirits as it marked the 25th venture of Aashirvad Movies.
