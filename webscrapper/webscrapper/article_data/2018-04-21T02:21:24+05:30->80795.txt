NEW DELHI: Former Chief Justice of   and tireless human rights activist   passed away on Friday. He was 94.

 “He was admitted to the Fortis hospital earlier this week. He was not able to take food and was vomiting repeatedly. He developed pneumonia and later succumbed to it,” a family friend told PTI.
 
 Justice Sachar was the chairperson of a committee set up by (then) Prime Minister   in 2005 to prepare a report on the social, economic and educational status of Muslims in the country. The seminal report, released in November 2006, received fulsome praise for its meticulousness.
 
 His death has been widely mourned. Senior   advocate H S Phoolka tweeted from his unverified handle @hsphoolka, “Justice Sachar was first judge to take stand against Rajiv govt on #1984SikhGenocide. To take away cases from his court, Rajiv govt got the roster of Delhi High Court changed. After retirement he became active member of our committee fighting for justice to victims. A great loss.”
 
 After his retirement in 1985, Justice Sachar was associated with the People's Union for Civil Liberties. He was also UN’s Special Rapporteur on Housing. Nobel peace laureate Kailash Satyarthi posted on the micro-blogging site, “India has lost a judicial luminary and a true human rights advocate.”
 
 Journalist Seema Mustafa wrote in The Citizen online mag, “He was a Judge who set an example. That after retirement Judges did not need to go into holes, and in fact were required to play a major role in keeping India on the Constitutional track. He spoke fearlessly, boldly, did not look for favours from the establishment regardless of who was in power…”.
 
 Justice Sachar was one of a kind. His courage and integrity will be missed.
