MANGALURU: District   president Harish Kumar said   workers were responsible for the attack that took place on them at Thota   on Tuesday. 

 Harish told reporters on Thursday that BJP workers who were returning from a fishermen’s convention that was addressed by party chief Amit Shah at Malpe on Tuesday, had instigated local residents with provocative slogans. “BJP workers are responsible for being attacked in Bengre. However, they are now trying to point fingers at us,” the   president said. He alleged that MP Nalin Kumar Kateel was spreading lies. 
 
 “The MP has nothing worth mentioning when it comes to the development of the district. The work of four-laning of national highways is progressing at a snail’s pace, but the MP is silent on the issue. He has not spoken about the district’s development in Parliament, but claims himself as the number one MP. If he is the number one MP, imagine the plight of the remaining MPs,” Harish said. 
 
 Earlier, Kateel had told reporters at a press conference that the brutal attack on BJP workers at   was the handiwork of the Congress.
