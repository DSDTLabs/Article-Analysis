KOCHI: Following heavy rains a fortnight ago, the   taluk hospital suffered a power outage and it took three days for the   to restore electricity. All these days, the patients had to bear the brunt but it is not the first time that the hospital faced a power disruption. Hospital sources said this happens quite often.

 The hospital receives around 1,000 outpatients (OP) per day and an average of 100 inpatients (IP) but doesn’t have a generator as an alternative if the KSEB’s power supply fails. It has been almost a year since Kochi corporation issued funds for procuring generator for the hospital, but the local body couldn’t even complete the tender procedure successfully.
 
 Even before that Kochi corporation had allotted a generator for the Karuvelippady hospital but it went to   hospital due to the pressure exerted by councillors representing the area. “When we approached the corporation authorities they said that they would complete the procedures and deliver the generator immediately. When there is power outage, the functions of ICU and nursing room where procedures like nebulization are done would be affected,” said Dr Minu Mathew, superintendent, taluk headquarters hospital, Karuvelippady. “Though we depend on   for water supply, the water stored in a sump will have to be pumped in to the overhead tanks. So, in the absence of power supply, there won’t be water in the bathrooms and toilets,”   said.
 
 According to the officials with Kochi corporation, there isn’t any qualified official for giving technical sanction for the tender. “So, we will have to constitute a committee for the purpose. Retired engineers from KSEB and PWD would be members of the committee. The committee can soon be constituted and it will give technical sanction to the project within a week or two,” said K D Ajayaghosh, superintending engineer, Kochi corporation.
