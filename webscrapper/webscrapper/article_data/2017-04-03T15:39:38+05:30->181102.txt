There’s one thing about Kajol, she keeps her fashion style minimal yet chic! She’s not the one who gives in too much for the ‘new trends’. Her simplistic and comfortable fashion always makes her stand out. From beautiful saris to minimal make-up, Kajol is one Bollywood star everyone loves.
 
 
 
 
 Recently, for an event promotion, she was spotted wearing a trench coat with a skirt from Lola by Suman B. She paired the marsala coloured trench coat with a camel coloured maxi skirt. The wrap-up style belt accentuated her waist and worked perfectly with the flowy fabrics. She completed the look with tassel adorned nude heels from Tresmode. And when it came to her make-up, she went for the minimal touch with nude lips and kohl-rimmed eyes.
