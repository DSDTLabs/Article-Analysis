MUMBAI: The Malabar Hills Citizens' Forum, which maintains   at  , has been accused of charging an exorbitant Rs 80,000 for use of the open space in the prime locality in south Mumbai. The trust admitted that they do charge for the use of the 65,000 sqm Priyadarshini Park, which has been set up on reclaimed land, but only after getting an all-clear from the  . 

 At the civic standing committee meeting on Wednesday, Samajwadi Party leader Rais Shaikh raised a point of order stating that a pre-primary school in his ward at Nagpada had complained to him that they had to pay Rs 80,000 to use the open ground for their annual sports day. "Priyadarshani Park is a public space; on what what basis are they charging so steeply? This is...loot...and another example of public space being exploited. The BMC needs to look into it immediately," claimed Shaikh, adding that the association already has many donors, so why was it collecting such hefty charges from the public. "The school showed me two receipts of Rs 40,000 each for using the park for a day to host its sports day. This is unacceptable," said Shaikh.
 
 Susieben Shah, general secretary of the Malabar Hill Citizens' Forum, said they charge for use of the ground, but after keeping the BMC in the loop. "In fact, those wanting to use the space have to first approach the BMC and only after it gives a nod, do we grant permission. We charge Rs 30,000 plus taxes per day, which includes cost of mandap, chairs, use of toilets, electricty and security. In case of extra arrangements, like a bigger mandap, additional charges are levied," said Shah. "We strictly adhere to the norms and only allow sporting events on the ground; we do not give out the open space for commercial activities," she clarified. 
 
 Justifying the high charges, Shah said they are a charitable trust and most of the funds are utilized for maintaining the park.
