 PUNE: The   authorities here on Thursday said around 2,600 LEDs (light emitting diodes) have been installed in the facility, which has reduced the daily power consumption from 192KW to 80KW.
 
 “The advantage with the   lights is that they save energy and are more durable than the regular lights. The entire airport area, including the terminal building, now has LEDs and we have witnessed a major reduction in power consumption,” an airport official said.
 
 Recently, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had signed an MoU with Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) for installing LEDs at airports, buildings and facilities owned by AAI across the country. The MoU includes replacement of the existing lights with LEDs. The entire project is estimated to cost around Rs 24.50 crore and EESL will carry out the warranty-period replacement for five years.
 
 “Almost all conventional lights at the airport have been replaced by the LEDs and the process is still on,” the official added.
 
 The Pune airport authorities are also installing a solar power plant. According to the plan, the solar panels are being set up at the airport’s hangar with the authorities targeting at generating 300KW energy. “The estimated cost of the project is Rs 1.27 crore,” another official said.
 
 The entire facility will be lit up and operated by solar power. The security systems, which include CCTV cameras, parking areas and floodlights among others, will run on solar power. Regular power supply will be kept as an alternative and used in cases of snags.
