HYDERABAD: Perturbed by recent reports about the state forest department allowing the   (GHMC) to go ahead with the felling of trees around   ­ in order to make way for the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) ­ the city's green brigade, on Thursday, floated an online petition, demanding that the decision be stalled with immediate effect.
The strongly-worded petition uploaded on http:www.change.org has been addressed to P K Jha, principal chief conservator of forests and B Janardhan Reddy, commissioner, GHMC.
 
 Drawing the officials' attention to the latest ruling of the   (NGT) on the   issue, which categorically states that any work related to the SRDP, including the cutting translocation of trees around the national park cannot commence unless the Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ) of the park is declared by the union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF & CC), the petition states how the recent reports point to a “incorrect interpretation“ of the   judgement by state authorities.
 
 The petitioners ­ a collective of aware citizens of Hyderabad ­ while expressing concern over “wrong infor mation“ being disbursed to the public at large, add how the ESZ matter is currently sub-judice and any activity at this juncture (including axing of trees) can “amount to contempt of the court orders“.
 
 “As these news articles were alarming to all concerned citizens of Hyderabad, we had no other option but to approach your office to seek your intervention to ensure that the orders of the Tribunal are abided by in true letter and spirit...We request you to also issue an immediate clarification on this subject to assuage the concerns of the citizens of our city,“ the petition states.
 
 Within minutes of being floated, the petition drew support from scores of people from across the city who signed it in hope of stalling the green murder.
