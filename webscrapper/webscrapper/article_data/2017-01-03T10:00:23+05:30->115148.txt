India is seen as the diabetes and coronary   capital of the world. According to current estimates, India will soon have the highest number of heart disease cases in the world. According to the Indian Heart Association, "50% of all   in Indians occur under 50 years of age and 25% of all heart attacks in Indians occur under 40 years of age. Population living in cities are three times more prone to heart attacks than people living in villages”.
 
  Heart disease is increasing in younger generation with a significant risk in both males and females. More and more number of young Indians are suffering from coronary artery disease, owing to their poor lifestyle, and if this continues the future looks even more dangerous.Ten years back, we at Apollo hospitals hardly saw any young patients with heart attack but now, we get many cases in the 25-35 age group with heart attack in our emergency.
  
  Problems faced by young Indians that increases heart risk are:
  
  • No preference given to Health
  • No time to exercise
  • Stress
  • Junk food
  • Obesityand smoking
  
  Such conditions can be avoided by taking proper precautions. In order to avoid it, we need to adopt a healthy life style. Eating healthy food, reducing stress levels and regular work outs will work as the pillars against the risk of heart attack. Walking is one the best way to keep your heart healthy.The risk of heart diseases is more in men when compared to women. Such gender differences and even the genetic impact cannot be avoided. These factors are called Non-modifiable risk factors. The persons who have these risk factors should take care accordingly to protect themselves from heart diseases, by frequently undergoing health check-ups.
  
  In case of a heart attack, it has been seen that the lack of knowledge often causes a delay in handling the situation, which could aggravate the damage and in some cases prove to be fatal. So to identify the early symptoms of heart attack is very essential.
  
  In Apollo hospital, my team’s approach towards heart attack patient is to open the closed artery which is causing heart attack within 30 minutes of patient’s arrival in emergency, as we can save the heart by acting fast. There is a wise proverb in cardiology that “Time is muscle”, so the time saved to open the blocked vessel will save the heart muscles from damage.
