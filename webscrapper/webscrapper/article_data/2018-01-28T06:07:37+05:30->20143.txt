LUCKNOW: Commuters on   will continue to face inconvenience for another six months because the proposal for funds for it is stuck in the web of corruption.

 While the government is investigating who is guilty of misusing funds in the riverfront project, the irrigation department is in a fix as it has no funds to repair the road.
 
 Because of the ongoing   inspection, the government is unable to release any funds for the project. Though the irrigation department has already spent around Rs 1,447 crore on it, work is stuck midway.
 
 An irrigation official said, “We need Rs 20 lakh for repairing the craters and concretising the barrage route. The principal secretary of irrigation last week agreed to send the proposal to the government for approval.” “It was after seeing the inconvenience of commuters that we decided to release a separate grant for repair other than the riverfront fund,” he added.
 
 Officials said that after funds get released, they will take another six months to repair the road.
 
 The broken road was closed in December 2016 after the contractor for the riverfront project had caused deep cracks on the barrage road during digging. More than a year later, the road shows no sign of levelling.
 
 When the new government came into power, three different kinds of probes into the project were launched. One is a judicial inquiry and another by a joint committee of PWD and irrigation officials. The most recent one is by CBI. Amid all inspections, work on the riverfront project has been halted.  , a regular commuter, said, “They have opened it only in name. The road is broken and covered in sharp stones which can hurt anyone.”
 
 Four-wheeler owner   said, “I cannot drive my car on this route as it has huge craters. My car’s bumper got severely damaged. They have wasted a huge sum of public money with no useful return.”
