In this week’s release,  ,   plays   — a simple, introvert girl, who is completely different from who she is in real life. A bundle of energy and someone who is always interacting with people on the set, to play Tulasi, Megha Sri had to completely change herself.

 “Tulasi is a dubbing artiste, who dubs for ads and cartoons, and lends her voice for announcements at railway and bus stations. She’s an introvert, who doesn’t have many friends and doesn’t mingle with anyone. She’s a simple girl-next-door, who goes from home to work, and back. It was very hard for me to play Tulasi, because I am the exact opposite. It takes me a couple of days to get comfortable on the set, but after that, I am full of josh and tease everyone. Also, the dialogues in the film are different. Usually, you see the hero recite poems to his lady love, but in Krishna Tulasi, it is my character who is very poetic in her language. So, the workshop we had before the film helped a lot,” she says. What also helped her perform better, adds Megha Sri, is having National Award-winner   as her co-star. “When the director ( ) first told me that I am paired with Sanchari Vijay, I was excited and nervous. Vijay sir is a bundle of talent and cans shots in a single take. Initially, it was hard for me to match his level of acting, but later, he started helping me out and gave suggestions. I learnt a lot from him that every small expression is important, and showed me how to express through the eyes, mouth, body, etc.,” she says.
