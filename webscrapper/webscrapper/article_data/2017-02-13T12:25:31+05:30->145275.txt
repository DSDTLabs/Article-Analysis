BHUBANESWAR: If the commissionerate police has its way, lifts in the city will have to install CCTV cameras soon. Taking a cue from Mumbai and Delhi police, the commissionerate police are set to pass an order to commercial and residential buildings, directing them to place surveillance cameras inside lifts. 

  "We will soon make it mandatory for buildings to install CCTV cameras. It will not only prevent crimes, but also help police crack offences which are reported as having occurred inside lifts. Police in some metro cities like Delhi and Mumbai have already passed such an order," DCP   told TOI.
 
 Police sources said the city currently has a total of around 2,300 elevators in multi-storey buildings, including apartments, hotels, shopping malls and government offices. 
 
 However, only around five per cent of the elevators have CCTV cameras installed in them. 
 
 Last week, a lady inspector of the state   lodged a complaint with police in Cuttack accusing some lawyers of having misbehaved with her inside a lift at the Orissa high court. 
 
 "Luckily, the high court elevator has CCTV camera facility. We are verifying the CCTV footage. It would have been difficult for us to verify her charges had the lift not had any CCTV cameras," said a police officer in Cuttack.
 
 When   editor-in-chief   was implicated in 2013 after a female journalist of his magazine levelled sexual harassment charges against him leading to his arrest, Goa police had said the lift did not have CCTV cameras which could have been used as viable evidence. 
 
 "Police should initially make it compulsory for shopping malls to install CCTV cameras inside elevators. We have been witnessing anti-socials crowding elevators to grope women a lot these days. Presence of CCTV cameras will instill a sense of fear among them," said  , a city student.
 
 In addition to helping police substantiate investigations, CCTV cameras will also help stranded users.
