It’s common for actors to mix work with family time, especially when they are shooting off shores.   is a master of this game. The actor, who is currently filming 'Gold' in and around London, has been carefully dividing his time on and of the shoot. The Reema Kagti-directorial went on floors at the beginning of this month and is expected to wrap towards the end of July. However, the good part is that the actor is not alone. His wife   and sister Alka Bhatia are with him in the Queen’s country. The women have been spending time together, taking off on road trips. Akshay, we hear, joins them as frequently as he can. He ensures that he wraps up as early in the day as he can to spend time with the ladies. And on his days off duty, he’s at their service. Now, that’s some multi-tasking!
