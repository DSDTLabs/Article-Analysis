NEW DELHI: The   Teachers’ Association ( )   on Monday hit the functioning of the university with teachers suspending classes. Though students said a few teachers did send mails asking them to attend classes, and also conducted extra classes, the attendance remained thin. Teachers of the university also took out a rally on campus to express their anger against the policy decisions of the MHRD.

 According to students, the strike has hit syllabus completion so close to the internal exams, expected to start in the next few weeks. “We are also close to the semester exams in April. Since this is an even semester, the load is also more,” a student of a   college said. However, the student added, that while some teachers had been calling for compulsory classes, the number of those attending them remained less than 10.
 
 The teachers of the university, while out of classes, expressed their anger and resentment towards the human resources and development ministry by taking out an ‘Adhikar Rally’.
 
 “The immediate issue was the March 5, 2018 UGC letter that is not only a U-turn in the Reservation Policy leading to inadequate representation in violation of the Constitutional requirements but also stands to jeopardise the appointment process in Delhi University,” said Rajib Ray, president of DUTA.
 
 The association has demanded “unconditional withdrawal of the letter”. Besides this, the teachers are also upset about the uncertainty of appointments and pensions, claiming that this has hit their morale. Ray said they have asked the VC for a meeting several times but to no avail.
