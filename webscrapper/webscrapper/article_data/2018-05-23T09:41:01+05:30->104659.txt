In a fresh twist to the recent communal violence, a high-level probe looking into the recent communal riots in   has found that not all shops were burnt by rioters and that some were set alight due to property disputes. 

 A few shops and properties that were not being vacated by tenants for decades were found to have been torched in an unusual manner, said sources in the police department.
 
 Most of these shops are situated in and around  , where property rates are higher than other areas of the city.
 
 When contacted, acting commissioner of police   said, "We are probing the cases with that angle too."
 
 An assistant commissioner of police said witnesses' account of torching of such properties along with CCTV footage, if any, and technical evidence are being collected to establish the involvement of landlords or land sharks.
