MUMBAI: "The bullet train is not meant for adivasis. We will not get to ride it. Why should we give our land to it?" asks Madhu Dhodi from   village in  . "We don't have decent roads or electricity. Instead of doing something for us, the government wants to take away our land for a bullet train meant for the rich," says Dhodi, a Warli tribal . 

 
 She was among the hundreds of tribals gathered at   under the banner of the Bhumi Adhikar Andolan (BAA) to protest against land acquisition for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train. The project passes through Dahanu, Palghar district.
 
 They were also demanding the repeal of a state notification in 2017 that dilutes the power of tribal villages to resist land acquisition. The notification waives the need for a gram sabha permission for sale of tribal land to non-tribals in case of a project of vital national importance as long as it is by mutual consent and at a fair price. Gram sabha permission was required under the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act 1996.
 
 Raghunath Sutar from Dahanu resisted a survey on his 5.5-acre paddy field for the bullet train earlier this month. "We received no notice and then a survey team came with a police force of around 150. We gathered a group of around 300 villagers and forced them to leave," says Sutar.
 
 Locals who were displaced for a dam project were resettled in two villages in Dahanu. "Now they will be displaced again for the bullet train. Is that fair?" asks Sutar.
 
 BAA activists sent a letter of demands to governor  . "Our main demand is that the notification diluting the PESA Act be repealed," said Brian Lobo of the Kashtakari Sanghatna.
