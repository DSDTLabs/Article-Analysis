NEW DELHI: Seven   lodged at a correctional home in Alipur locked up the   in a bathroom and escaped after scaling the wall on Monday. This incident comes less than a week after four girls climbed over the boundary walls of their shelter home.

 The warden later managed to free himself and informed the authorities. However, they only called up the cops after six hours on Monday night after failing to locate the escapees. The juveniles had been sent to the reform home after being detained from different places in west and outer Delhi on charges of loot and theft.
 
 The warden, Satvir (38), told the cops that he had gone to serve food to the seven juveniles who were lodged in the same room. He stayed there while the boys had their meal. After half an hour, they asked him to take them to the washroom for cleaning the utensils.
 
 Satvir didn’t allow all of them to go together and asked four boys to wait inside the room. When the other three were inside the washroom, they threw a plate at the warden’s head and beat him up. They were soon joined by the remaining four who also thrashed him. One of them then brought a bed sheet from their room and tied Satvir up.
 
 The juveniles took the keys from the warden’s pocket, went outside and climbed over the 10-foot boundary wall. Cops are questioning vendors in the area and scanning footage of   cameras installed in the neighbourhood to get clues. “A search was conducted in the areas adjoining the correctional home. The local police stations have been informed about the escape. It appears the boys had been planning the   for the past one week,” said a senior officer.
