SHIMLA: A Himachal Pradesh-based NGO has opposed the construction of three dams — Tehri, Kishau and Renuka — in   and Uttarakhand. 

 A spokesperson for Himachal Pradesh-based NGO  , Manshi Asher, on Saturday cited a report prepared by two of its members, ‘Submerging Jaunsar Bawar’. She said Prakash Bhandari and Kesang Thakur of Himdhara Collective, in 2014-15, carried out a field investigation and study of the area to be impacted by the proposed Kishau dam in Himachal and Uttarakhand.
 
 During the study, she said, the duo filed an RTI plea with the   (UJVNL), and found out that nine villages in Uttarakhand and eight villages in Himachal (6 in Sirmour and 2 in Shimla districts) were going to be affected by Kishau dam project and its submergence area would be spread over 2,950 hectares. The project involves building of a 236-metre-high dam on the Tons river, a major tributary of the  , originating in the Jamnotri mountains, and passing through Shimla and Sirmour districts in Himachal Pradesh and Jaunsar Bawar region in Dehradun district.
 
 Of the submergence area, 512 hectares is cultivated private land and 2,438 hectare is forest land. In all, 5,498 people belonging to 701 families would be directly affected by the project, the report said. Villages are located all along the 44.5km submergence area, it said. 
 
 Asher said if Kishau and the proposed 315-metre-high Pancheshwar dams were built, then one of India’s most disaster-prone states, Uttarakhand, would also be the site of the three highest dams of the country — Pancheshwar (315m), Tehri (281m) and Kishau (236m). In a recent meeting in New Delhi, Yamuna basin states, including Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, agreed to a draft inter-state agreement for the construction of Lakhwar, Renuka and Kishau dams on the river and its tributaries. 
 
 She said all the projects were planned under the Upper Yamuna Basin Agreement signed by five states in the 1990s.
