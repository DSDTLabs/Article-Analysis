THRISSUR: Police on Friday took  , the man accused of murdering a youth for questioning the stalking of his cousin, to   bus stand for taking evidence.

 Midhun, an autorickshaw driver, had allegedly attacked the victim,  , with an iron rod at the bus stand on January
 
 28. The 26-year-old Sujith, who had sustained serious head injuries, breathed his last at the hospital on January 31.
 
 Midhun, who was absconding after the assault, had attempted suicide by allegedly cutting his veins near the woman’s house on February 3. Police had formally arrested him from the hospital to which he was admitted following the suicide bid. On his discharge from the hospital, he was sent to Irinjalakkuda sub-jail as per a court order.
 
 He was remanded to police custody for two days on Thursday to enable the police to conduct a detailed investigation.
 
 During the interrogation at the bus stand Midhun had reportedly described how he had attacked Sujith. Irinjalakkuda DSP Famous Varghese said the iron rod used to attack   was recovered by police from the bushes nearby with the help of Midhun on Friday.
 
 Meanwhile, Sujith’s father   has alleged that the suicide attempt by the accused was a drama prompted by influential people. Venugopal who was present near the bus stand when the evidence collection was in progress, said a closer examination of the suicide note would make it clear that it was written by someone else as Midhun was not well versed in Malayalam in which it was written.
 
 He said it was unfortunate that the people who had seen Sujith being attacked did not take him to hospital. They remained mute spectators while he was lying in a pool of blood at the bus stand, he said.
