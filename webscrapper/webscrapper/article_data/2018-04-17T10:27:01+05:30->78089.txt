CHANDIGARH: A spark from a needle cutter kept near the paediatric resuscitator in operation theatre number 3 in the emergency complex of   triggered the fire on April 11, a fact-finding committee has said in its report. The committee members inferred the oxygen-rich environment in the OT led to the fire from the spark.

 The report was submitted to officiating director Dr   on Monday. The investigation ruled out short circuit as the cause.
 
 “We spoke to people present on duty at the accident site and also visited the OT complex. It is too congested and any small spark can lead to fire within the OT, which has oxygen-rich environment,” said Dr  , dean (research), and the head of the fact-finding committee.
 
 Oxygen cylinder and other inflammable gases were not switched off soon after a surgery, the report said. The report mentioned that on April 11 at 9.30pm in OT number 3 a Caesarean section was going on. The baby was delivered and the paediatrician had resuscitated the delivered child and left the theatre along with the baby and staff nurse. Some 15 minutes before the incident,  , a junior resident doctor from the department of anaesthesia who was present in the OT, smelled something abnormal. She noticed that there was spark in the needle cutter.
 
 The patient was shifted from the theatre quickly and safely. Besides Dr Deepika, Shallu, nursing officer and Dr Indu, a resident of gynaecology, who were also present in the OT, corroborated the same facts.
 
 The committee also submitted remedial measures to avoid such incidents in future. This included expansion of the OT, replacement of needle cutters with manual needle cutters. Experts suggested that the supply of the oxygen and other inflammable anaesthetic gases and fluid should be switched off when it is not in use.
