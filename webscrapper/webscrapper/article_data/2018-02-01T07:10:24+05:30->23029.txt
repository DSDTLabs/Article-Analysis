 "I'd love to go to into Buckingham Palace and give it a high-tech makeover. I want to modernise it and get the Queen kitted out with a projector and a home-cinema room. And she needs a chill-out zone. I'll programme her TV, so the only things that come on are our show and the news. I want her to have the clap! I mean (claps hands together) 'lights on'," Andre said.
