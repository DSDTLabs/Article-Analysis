A committee headed by actor-producer-distributor   has been formed to put an end to the on-going strike that has paused the   film industry since Dec 16, 2016. Plans are in place to form a new organisation of film exhibitors under the supervision of actors and directors who also own theatres. 

 There will be a meeting regarding the new organisation in Kochi on Dec 14 to decide future actions and its constitution. On Thursday, the head of the current film exhibitors federation had condemned Dileep's involvement in forming a new body and also said that they will press charges against the theatres that had released movie against the decision of the federation.
 
 The ongoing strike is due to the demands of the film exhibitors, who want a 50:50 profit sharing as opposed to the lesser share of 60:40, which is currently practised. The   outrightly dismissed the demands as it would result in   making more money off a movie than the producers.
