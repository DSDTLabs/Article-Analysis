PUNE: The Deccan Gymkhana police   demonetized currency   with a face value of Rs 1 crore from two persons, including a 70-year-old woman, travelling in an autorickshaw on Thursday night.

 A team, headed by senior inspector   of the Deccan Gymkhana police station and sub-inspector Rahul Kolambikar, intercepted the autorickshaw on Fergusson College road. 
 
 Suspecting something amiss, they took the vehicle to the police station. 
 
 On finding a bag, the police officers opened it and found the   currency notes of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500. 
 
 Kolambikar told TOI that questioning the woman, a resident of Yerawada, and a shoemart owner from Ganesh Peth revealed that they were taking the scrapped notes to exchange those with new currency notes.
 
 Police are yet to ascertain from where and how they had brought the notes. The woman told police that she works as a real estate agent and had collected the cash during the last few years.
 
 Kadam said police have informed the Central   officials and the notes will be handed over to them for further probe.
