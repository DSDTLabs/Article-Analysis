It was reported that National Award-winning Marathi filmmaker,   would be making his Hindi debut with a film titled ‘Jhund’. Said to be based on a retired sports teacher who starts a slum soccer movement and touching upon issues of drug abuse and crime, the film was set to star   in a prominent role. The actor even reportedly signed on for the film.

 However, if latest reports are to be believed, then Big B has opted out of the project. Owing to shoot delays and with no clarity about the film going on-floors, Bachchan allegedly pulled out as he couldn’t stretch his calendar anymore and has assigned his dates to other filmmakers.
 
 Nagraj had said he that had begun working on the ‘Jhund’ script after he wrapped up ‘Sairat’. Even though the film is based on a real-life character, he has reportedly written it in a way that it moves far away from the source.
