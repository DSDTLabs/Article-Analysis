PANAJI: A majority of traders and shopkeepers at the   bus stand building are yet to receive no-objection certificates (NOCs) from the directorate of fire and emergency services. 

 After a massive fire broke out in the building in October last year, causing losses pegged at Rs 1.2 crore, tenants were instructed to ensure that their shops have fire prevention equipment on their premises, else they would lose their trade licences.
 
 “We have already purchased fire safety equipment and installed it,” said shopkeeper Antonio Inacio of the  . “We had approached the commissioner of the Corporation of the City of  , who had agreed to renew our trade licences on the condition that we get the NOCs from the fire services before the end of June this year. All of us have cooperated in every way that we could.” He added that shopkeepers also wrote to the fire servces asking if they’re required to abide by any other conditions, but haven’t received a response yet. 
 
 The directorate maintains that NOCs are being granted to those who comply with norms. “Not all shopkeepers have complied as of now,” said assistant division officer Ajit Kamat. “Only about ten shops have installed fire safety equipment so far. If all shopkeepers install the equipment, we can conduct an inspection, following which the NOCs can be granted.”
 
 There are a total of 140 shops at the Panaji bus stand, all of which have to comply with fire safety norms. Only fruit and flower vendors are exempted. Over the past few months, the directorate has been conducting safety audits of government buildings, educational institutions, and hospitals.
