NEW DELHI: Ahead of threats by   groups to intensify their agitation this week, Central Board of Secondary Education has issued an advisory on Saturday to parents and students appearing for their Class 10 and Class 12   on Monday. 

  “The students and parents are hereby informed and advised to take necessary measures to reach the examination centres well before the scheduled time to avoid any inconvenience in anticipation of the gherao,” the advisory said.
 
 All-India Jat Aarakshan Sangarsh Samiti (AIJASS) has called for a march to Delhi to ‘gherao’ Parliament and hold ‘dharnas’ on the border blocking all highways.
 
 Schools said they were in touch with parents and suggested that students reach the   centres well before time to avoid delay. “It is the third paper for Class XII and they might take it a little easy thinking they know the route. But, we advise them to still be a little early,” said Ashok Pandey, principal Ahlcon International in Mayur Vihar. 
 
 However, principals have also cancelled excursions scheduled around this time keeping in mind the agitation threat. “We usually have children going to museums and sometimes out of station. But, because of the situation, we cancelled these excursions,” said Ameeta Mulla Wattal, principal Springdales School, Pusa Road.
 
 “For students appearing for board exams, we cannot do much as a school because it is between the students and the parents who have to make it to the centres on time,” she added.
