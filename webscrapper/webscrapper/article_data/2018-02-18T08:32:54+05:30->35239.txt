Pune: District guardian minister   inaugurated the crucial   at   on Saturday even as local residents raised concerns over lack of adequate  . 

 Residents and shop owners stated that roads and service lanes located under the flyover were missing key safety features.
 
  
  
 
 The flyover at Karvenagar has two separate wings to cater to vehicular traffic in both directions. However, residents’ concern is to do with the fact that pillars of both wings have been constructed in the middle of the roads under the flyover and do not have safety barriers. Chances of vehicles crashing against the pillars, especially during the night time, cannot be ruled out, residents stated.
 
 Suresh Raskar, a regular commuter, said, “One can see haphazard parking of vehicles below the flyover.The traffic signal here was shut throughout Saturday. There are no markings for PMPML bus stops on either side of the road. The service lanes are rather narrow. The civic administration needs to mark parking slots to ensure that dedicated carriageways are kept open for vehicles.”
 
 Vijay Shah, a local shopkeeper, said the new construction will not help ease traffic under the flyover. “Most PMPML buses are going to travel on service roads. The authorities must address the issues of local residents, who are going use the service roads more often,”   said.
 
 Local residents have highlighted the sad state of footpaths in the area saying they need urgent upgradation.
