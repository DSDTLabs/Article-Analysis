VISAKHAPATNAM: The two kingpins of the online betting gangs busted by city cops resided in   Kirlampudi layout by posing as as work-from-home software professionals.

 Marada Lakshmi Chandra Sekhar from SR Nagar in Hyderabad and Avupati Bheema Raju from   in East Godavari, along with their assistants, were always dressed in formals and carried laptops to keep up the show. They joined the world of betting as ‘phone boys’ — those who announce stakes to clients. They worked in Bangalore and Mumbai earlier and after gaining experience they decided to start their own network. 
 
 At the time of the raids, they were dealing with 107 punters, who in return allegedly have 10 punters each, as cops seized as many as 107 mobiles and five multi-level cell connectivity boxes.
 
 City Task Force ACP I   told TOI that during the time of the raids they came to know that betting to the tune of Rs 32 lakh was going on. Wednesday night’s case was the biggest, as besides the arrests they also seized huge amounts of cash and other related equipments.
