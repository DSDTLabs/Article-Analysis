LUDHIANA: Almost two years after the private operator discontinued City Bus Service on the   due to poor response, the service was restarted on the ever-busy route on Saturday.

 Congress councillors Hari Singh Brar, Pankaj Sharma, Dilraj Singh and other leaders flagged off mini buses from Rajguru Nagar amid much fanfare. But mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu did not participate in the event as he was out of town on Saturday.
 
 Meanwhile, residents gave mixed response to the resumption of bus service on the route. Their major concern was the number of buses (two) available on the route and their timings.
 
 A resident of Rajguru Nagar Brij Mohan Kalia said, “It is a great respite for students, senior citizens and others. Instead of going in autos, we will prefer traveling through buses.”
 
 Priyanka Sharma of BRS Nagar said, “If we miss a bus, then we will have to wait for at least an hour to get the second bus. Whereas, the autos are available almost after every second. She said in case, the authorities want to make these buses successful, more buses should be introduced on the route.”
 
 The City Bus Service was introduced on this route in October 2015 and was discontinued in July 2016. At that time, there were low floor buses which had capacity to carry more passengers. Sources said mini buses, which have been introduced now, would not cause any hindrance in traffic movement.
 
 Baljit Singh, manager, City Bus Service, said though buses were flagged off on Saturday, the service would formally start from Monday onwards.
