NOIDA: Nearly a month after a court had directed the local police to register a case against   for delay in construction and delivery of flats in Sapphire Phase II, Sector 45, the police on Thursday filed an   at Sector 39 police station.

 The case has been registered against two directors—Anil Sharma and Suvesh Chandra Kumar—for cheating, criminal breach of trust, forgery, etc under sections 420, 406, 468, 336, 337 and 338 of the IPC. 
 
 The complainant, Colonel   (retd), a homebuyer, said the developer had promised delivery of flats in December 2012. They had planned to build 1,309 flats in 14 towers in the group housing society. However, no tower is totally complete. “They have delivered only 446 flats to the homebuyers. The other flats have been lying abandoned at different stages of completion,” he said.
 
 Malhi said the residents, who have shifted to the society, through correspondence with  , came to know that the developer has not deposited the entire cost of purchased land and hence not completed the formalities of group housing project. 
 
 “The Noida Authority has not given completion certificates to the developer. We have not been able to do registry of our flats,” Malhi said.
 
 The residents are also worried as district magistrate B N Singh has ordered physical inspection of homes in residential towers of housing societies to check if they have occupation certificates. On January 30, the DM had directed the stamps and registration department to file the FIRs against such developers. The legal measures have been initiated as the state exchequer is losing a significant chunk of revenue in the process. 
 
 “We are investigating the matter,” said Avnish Dixit, SHO, Sector 39.
