NAGPUR: Much to the fears of   and a section of conservationists against its re-release, the problem   of  , which was reunited with wild in Bor Tiger Reserve on July 29, is responding well.

 On July 29, after fixing a radio collar, the tigress was soft-released on Navargaon ashram school premises, a village that has been relocated from the reserve.
 
 “After three days of rigorous monitoring and close watch, it seems the tigress is doing well. It killed a big calf on July 30 and is also consuming its meat,” said Rishikesh Ranjan, chief conservator of forests ( ) and field director of Pench.
 
 “We have also opened the gates of the school for hard-release of the wildcat. As of now, it has not stepped outside,” Ranjan added. Ranjan told TOI that the tigress has gone extremely shy and is avoiding human presence. 
 
 “I hope the tigress settles down. This is my biggest concern. Being released in a completely new area, it will take some time to settle down,” said   (wildlife) AK Misra.
 
 Currently, Bor has two tigresses with Katrina, the dominating female. TOI on June 6 had reported Katrina delivering third litter in 2.5 years. Pench officials suspect that Katrina must be under tremendous mating pressure from Bor’s dominating male Bajirao.
 
 “We hope that with new tigress settling down, this pressure will reduce. The tigress released is two years old,” experts said.
