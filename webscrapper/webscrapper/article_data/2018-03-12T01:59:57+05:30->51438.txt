NEW DELHI: A manhunt has been launched for a   who duped dozens of   in south Delhi of crores on the pretext of providing them jobs in Indian Railways by impersonating the personal secretary to minister of railways Piyush Goyal. Police have identified 10 victims from whom the suspect had taken around Rs 2-3 lakh each.

 The accused, who introduced himself as R K Verma, drove an i20 car and had rented accommodations in Vasant Kunj and Chhatarpur. Most victims are from these localities.
 
 The   came to the fore when one Mukesh Chaudhary lodged a police complaint. He said that he worked as an office boy at Sai Kunj society in Vasant Kunj. He was introduced to Verma while he was looking for a flat in January. Verma had allegedly told him that he would shift there by February.
 
 Verma asked Chaudhary why he was doing petty jobs and not trying for a secured government job. When Chaudhary showed interest, Verma claimed that he was “Niji Sachiv” to the minister and would get him a job in railways.
 
 Chaudhary arranged for Rs 2 lakh and gave it to Verma along with his documents. “The next week, Verma took me to his house in Chhatarpur where his wife said that I should not be worried as he had helped many get jobs. I was told that a call letter for interview would arrive in 10-15 days and he would be the one conducting it,” Chaudhary said.
 
 In the subsequent days, Verma allegedly lured other youths of the locality — Kamlesh and Deepak — and took Rs 2 lakh from each of them. When they told that they had only studied till Class X, Verma told them he would get the jobs in “Group D”.
 
 When the youths didn’t receive a call letter, they asked Verma for their money. He gave them post-dated cheques and other documents, like his car’s papers.
 
 On March 4, Verma and his family went missing. The next day, dozens of youths went to his house and then called the cops. One youth, Rohtash, claimed he had been duped of Rs 16 lakh. Chaudhary and three others had lost Rs 8 lakh.
