Director   is busy working on the script of his much delayed film ' ' but is not sure when the movie will go on floors. 

 In November 2016, Akshay had announced on Twitter about doing another project with Neeraj titled 'Crack' which was to release on Independence Day this year. He had also shared the first look of the film which showed a broken pair of spectacles. 
 
  
  
 However, due to some reasons best known to the makers, 'Crack' got delayed and rumors of the film being shelved were doing the rounds. "We are working on the script of 'Crack' right now. Once the script is ready we will begin (shoot)," Neeraj said. 
 
 Ask him if the film will go on floors this year or next year the director says, "Let's see. I won't say anything till the script is locked." Refuting the rumors Akshay had cleared the air last month on social media that 'Crack' will happen.
 
 Akshay and Neeraj have earlier collaborated on movies like 'Baby' and 'Special 26'. Neeraj was also one of the producers of 'Rustom'. Also the director-actor duo will collaborate for 'Baby 2'. 
 
 Talking about the status of the film, the 'M S Dhoni : The Untold Story' director said, "We are working. We will have a gap between the two films (referring to 'Baby' and 'Baby 2'). May be it will take some more time (to go on floors)." 
 
 Neeraj is all excited about his upcoming project ' '. The action spy thriller stars   in the lead role. It is scheduled to release on March 31 this year.
