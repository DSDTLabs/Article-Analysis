 may have a successful career in films but the actor says music is still his first love. 

 The 36-year-old star said he is thrilled to be showing off his vocal talents in new Broadway revival 'Sunday in the Park with George'. 
 
  
  
 "It's so nice to get to express myself through music, I always have in my family and I did growing up as a child throughout school. I had so much wonderful luck as an actor in films that how can you not move in that direction when the opportunities are there? But truly my love, my heart has always been in singing, particularly in the musical space. And so it's really nice to do it finally and now people go like, 'Oh, I guess he can do it, OK,"   said.
