Surat: The effort by the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) to provide a mass transport to the people of the city is only paying partial dividends. It is only popular in peripheral areas of the city as people there don’t have access to private transport. The Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) buses can be seen plying empty in Vesu whereas on Surat-Kamrej route, SMC was forced to increase their number due to the heavy rush.

 The civic body plies 109 BRTS buses on nine routes of the city covering a distance of 102km and has 155 bus stations. SMC plans to add 50 more buses to its fleet. 
 
 “We started with 12 buses on the Surat-Kamrej route but had to increase the number to 20 seeing the rush,” said an officer from SMC’s BRTS cell. 
 
 Sarthana-Y Junction-ONGC is the longest route with 20 buses operating between Kharwarnagar junction and Sarthana. However, buses are full only during peak hours in morning and evening. 
 
 “We have empty buses plying on most of the Vesu area. People are reluctant to use BRTS buses because of the absence of last mile connectivity to their homes. Similar situation persists in Rander zone too,” the official said.
 
 Rajesh Patel, a resident of Adajan, said, “I take BRTS bus when I have to go to Jahangirpura to meet my parents. Travelling in auto rickshaws means spending Rs100 to reach home. We need late night bus service too.” 
 
 Shivanand Swamy, from Cept University in Ahmedabad, said, “A situation is developing in Surat where in another four months, the ridership should double. People belonging to middle and higher middle-classes will also start using the mass transport in the city.” 
 
 SMC aims to raise ridership to more than 1.5 lakh people on BRTS buses daily by the year-end.
