NEW DELHI:   Human Rights Commission ( ) has issued notices to   government and the Union health ministry over a report that excessive use of pesticides and insecticides had left residue of heavy metals in the soil and ground water, causing serious diseases to many people in the   region of Punjab.

 The commission asked the Punjab chief secretary and the secretary of health ministry to send a detailed report on the matter within six weeks, informing about steps taken after 2012, when the commission had disposed of the matter on an assurance by the state government that it would take prompt action.
 
 The commission observed that “it seems that even after lapse of a period of more than seven years, things have not moved and the people residing in the Malwa region are still suffering from various diseases including cancer, liver failure, renal failure and birth defects etc”.
 
 “The negligence by state authorities has caused grave violation of human rights of these people. Due to these diseases, poor victims are not able to lead a normal life with dignity. The insensitive approach of the administration is apparent. The state cannot leave its citizens, affected by various diseases due to soil and drinking water poisoning, to live in undignified and traumatised conditions,” the NHRC said.
 
 According to reports, heavy metals in soil and groundwater have reached dangerous levels due to rampant use of pesticides, herbicides, medicines, paints and cosmetics.
