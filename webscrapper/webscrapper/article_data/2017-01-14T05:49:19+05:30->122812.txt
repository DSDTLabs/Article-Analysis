HYDERABAD: Cyberabad, the IT hub of the city that hums with activity around the clock, through the year, has also been the worst in terms of   with as many as 1,125 persons losing their lives in accidents. Telangana as a whole in the year 2015, as per the state transport department data witnessed 21,145 road accidents which resulted in 7,047 deaths.

 “Many of the victims are youth. This is a worrisome factor,” transport minister P Mahender Reddy said on Friday. After Cyberabad, the pre- reorganization Mahabubnagar district registered 957 deaths followed by Medak that stood third with 919 deaths. The government, the minister said was taking several steps to improve safety on roads. “We will focus on road safety and launch programmes to educate people on the issue during the Road Safety Week beginning on January 17,” he said.
 
 As part of the efforts to improve safety on roads, the government will launch RASTA, a programme to create awareness on road safety. The minister also released the logo for the Roads Are Safe To All programme (RASTA). It takes over from SAFER (Safety Always For All Roads) which was introduced in united  .
 
 To improve two-wheeler rider safety, it is also likely that the government might consider extending in a phased manner to the rest of the state the ‘no helmet-no petrol’ rule that has been tried out in Adilabad. “This policy has given good results and compliance with the law regarding wearing of helmets by two-wheeler riders,” Mahender Reddy said.
 
 The government will also follow the directives issued by the   on road safety, he added. One of the Supreme C ourtdirectives relates to removal of all liquor shops within 100 metres of a highway.
 
 Incidentally, Telangana stood fourth in the country, according to the  , in road accident fatalities resulting from driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs. The top three states on this front in 2015 were Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
