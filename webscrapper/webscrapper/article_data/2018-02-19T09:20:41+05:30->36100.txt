MUMBAI: The recent   of an Ola driver by three motorcyclists at Govandi has spurred the traffic department into action. The city   have started to identify stretches where “goondaism” by bikers travelling in groups has been reported in the past. Special drives will be conducted in these stretches for bringing the culprits to book.

 “Bikers are found to be indulging the most in violation of traffic rules, particularly those riding in groups. There are complaints of racing on promenades or riding in the wrong direction. These instances are mostly reported at night when the presence of traffic police on the streets is skeletal due to our limited strength," said a senior traffic police officer.
 
  
  
 The number of two-wheelers has increased exponentially over the years. In 2011-12, there were 11.3 lakh motorcycles and around 6.2 lakh cars on the streets of Mumbai. As of January this year, the number of two-wheelers has surged to over 18 lakh while that of cars is around 10 lakh. The road length in Mumbai, at around 2,000km, has not changed significantly. 
 
 “Unruly motorcyclists are seen more in certain areas than others.   at  , for instance, on particular nights has motorcyclists riding in triples and hollering up to the Western Express Highway. Then there are groups of bikers riding in a zig-zag manner trying to show off their riding skills when they are actually putting their lives and those of others on the road at risk,” said Ashok Datar of Mumbai Environmental Social Network (MESN). He added that a crackdown is necessary on modified bikes that create immense noise on the street. 
 
 A high powered committee set up by the state in 2012, as directed by the Bombay high court, had recommended a system of penalty points and graded punishment, depending on the severity of the traffic violation committed. The system is yet to be implemented. Transport experts say it's probably time to review licencing process for motorcyclists and make it stricter.
