 “A medical student has to clear as many as 13 exams and score at least 50 per cent marks to get MBBS degree. It takes five-and-half years of study and of modern medicine including one year internship. The proposal of the eligibility test for the post graduate courses is redundant and also challenge the functioning of the medical colleges, MCI and IMA” said   city president Dr Sanjay Londhe.
 
 IMA’s local secretary Dr Sumit Shukla and IMA’s city youth wing acting president Dr Rahul Rokade were among addressed the gathering.
 
 “While the government is planning to make it compulsory for the budding doctors to give the eligibility test, there is no plan to conduct similar examination for the foreign graduates to prove their eligibility before starting medical practice in India” said Rokade.
 
 The agitating students and IMA members launched a rally that passed by new OPD building and the dental college before concluding at MYH’s left gate.
 
 The existing and future doctors also raised voice against the government’s decision to replace   (MCI) from the proposed   Bill (NMC 2016).
