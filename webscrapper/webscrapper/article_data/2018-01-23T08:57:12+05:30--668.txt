VASCO:   and Israil Gurung struck at the death to give   a 2-0 victory over  , their third in a row in the I-League, at the Tilak Maidan in   on Monday.

 
 When it looked like the teams would settle for a point each, Gambian striker Ceesay broke the deadlock with two minutes left on the clock and substitute Gurung doubled the lead in added time.
 
 The victory gives Churchill Brothers 10 points - all accumulated from their last four matches - and takes them to the seventh spot, previously occupied by Indian Arrows with the same number of points. Churchill, however, are placed ahead of Arrows due to their better head-to-head count.
 
 With Kalu Ogba recovering in time from a muscle strain, Churchill started with an unchanged playing 11 that defeated Shillong Lajong FC 2-0 last week. The two-time champions dominated proceedings right from the start but were made to sweat by their young opposition who simply soaked in the pressure.
 
 Mechac Koffi thought he had given the home team an early lead but was ruled off side. Soon, the Ivory Coast striker had another glorious opportunity when Yendrembam Meitei provided a perfect long ball that caught Anwar Ali off guard but Koffi blasted wide with only goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Singh at his mercy.
 
 Arrows were clueless in the initial minutes and were disorganised. Lone striker Abhijit Sarkar was given hardly any space by Churchillâ€™s centre-back Osagie Monday, who even capitalised on his own errors with ease.
