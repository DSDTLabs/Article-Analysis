No one can do   festivals like engineering students. Period! They are the ones who know how to create ‘mahol’ in the campus. From IITs to city engineering colleges, future engineers organise some of the best   that everyone remembers for years. However, this year, city colleges have dropped the grandeur of their fests in the wake of demonetisation. The sponsorships they get for such fests have been seriously affected.

  “Yes, demonetisation has surely affected our college fest. Many of our sponsors pulled out this time citing the reason of money crunch. Last year, our department got a sponsorship of Rs 40,000 for the annual fest. This year, however, we had to settle on Rs 25, 000,” says Prathamesh Kaloge, a student of instrumentation department of  . “We even had to cancel some events due to lack of money,” he shares.
 
  
 
 
  While few colleges and departments settled on less sponsorship, others went from post to pillar to complete their target. “We had a target of Rs 2, 00,000. However, compared to last year, this year we had to struggle a lot to get the sponsorship. We had to approach many people and companies, and had to knock on many doors,” shares Sahil Thakare, student of civil engineering department, NDMVP Engineering College. “Many people told us that they can’t give us sponsorships. However, when one door used to close, we used knock on another door,” he adds.
 
  
 
 
  Few colleges in the city were fortunate enough to get the sponsorship within time and go ahead with their event schedules. “Planning in advance helped us. And we set our sponsorship goals low. We stressed on handling maximum things by student contribution and our students were the main manpower that we used throughout the event,” says Kunal Kabra, engineering student and event co-ordinator of PVG Engineering College.
