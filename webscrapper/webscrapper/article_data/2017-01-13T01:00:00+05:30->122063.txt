The onset of the harvest season, which is commemorated by celebrating  , is here. And besides the season, a lot has changed at stalls selling kites, too. For starters, apart from Bollywood posters, PM   and his move towards demonetisation is a prominent element on the kites. Current affairs, be it the loss of Indian soldiers in several terror attacks last year or the havoc in Palestine, such images and messages are also dominating the scene. However, the new entrant in the market is the two-line stunt kite, which is perfect if you wish to go to a beach on a breezy day! 

  
  Stunt kite, the new entrant in the market, is priced at `1,500. Use a fishing manja for this one. The Palestinian flag colours, too, have made it to the kites.
