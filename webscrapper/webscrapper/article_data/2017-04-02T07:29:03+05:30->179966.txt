NEW DELHI: When the housekeeping team of a luxury hotel knocked on doors to ask guests if they could clear out their mini-bars on Friday night, many mistook it for an April Fool prank. “When we told them of the   order 
  , one of them said I should work on a better prank,” said a hotel staffer. Not everyone was so good humoured, with some guests complaining angrily.

 Other establishments came up with various ways to implement or 
  . Some intrepid owners closed their main entrance and opened the rear one as it was farther away and beat the 500m threshold. Yet others argued that the distance from the highway to their premises should be measured by motorable distance, not as the crow flies.
 
 Gurgaon’s Cyber Hub, known for its many watering holes, stayed open sans liquor even as excise officials camped outside. A board outside a pub, Twist, read ‘No alcohol, No Happy Hour’.
 
 In Delhi, 100 authorised  , restaurant and hotel bars had been shut down by Saturday morning. But more could be added to that list.
