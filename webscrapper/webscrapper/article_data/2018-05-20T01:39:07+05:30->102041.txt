New Delhi:Former diplomat  , who had served at the Indian high commission in Islamabad, was on Saturday sentenced to three years in jail for passing on sensitive information to Pakistan's ISI. 

  Stating that her actions caused a "severe security threat", additional sessions judge Sidharth Sharma gave Gupta the maximum sentence for the offences of spying and wrongful communication of information protected under the law, observing that an educated woman like her did not deserve any leniency. Gupta had sought leniency on the ground that she was a senior citizen, a single woman and was a victim of circumstances. 
 
 After passing the sentence, the court granted her bail to allow her to appeal. 
 
  Gupta, 61, who was the second secretary (press & information) at the high commission from 2007 till her arrest on April 22, 2010 during a visit here, was held guilty on Friday under various provisions of the Official Secrets Act. She was suspected by Indian agencies of spying for ISI since 2008. The court had also noted that various electronic gadgets, including laptops and Blackberry phones purchased in her name, contained e-mails sent to various ISI handlers.
