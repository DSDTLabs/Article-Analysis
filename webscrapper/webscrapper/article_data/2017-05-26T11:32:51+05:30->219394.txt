PATNA: At least eight passengers, including a minor, were charred to death when their bus caught fire in Nalanda district on Thursday evening.
 
  Expressing his deep condolences, CM   announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the kin of deceased. He also said the injured would be provided free medical treatment.
  
  Police said the incident took place at Vishwakarma Chowk under the Harnaut police station area, 60km from Patna. The Sheikhpura-bound bus had originated from Patna.
  
  Nalanda DM Thiyagarajan S M said the eight bodies were taken for autopsy, but none of them was identified as yet. “They are so badly scorched that it was difficult to differentiate even between men and women,” he said.
  
  It was a private bus, named Baba Rath. “Eleven other received minor injuries,” the DM said, adding the survivors were pulled out after breaking windowpanes.
  
  Thiyagarajan said several bags full of certain chemicals, perhaps carbide used to ripen fruits, had been stacked in the front portion of the bus. “The flames emanated from one of these bags and spread within seconds,” he said and added traces of the chemical were found inside the burnt vehicle.
  
  A police officer said at least 60 passengers were aboard the bus. It was reduced to ashes even before a fire tender could reach the spot, he said.
