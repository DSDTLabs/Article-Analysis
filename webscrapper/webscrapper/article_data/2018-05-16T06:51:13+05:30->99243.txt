AHMEDABAD: After the brief respite of Monday, extreme heat gripped Gujarat again with the mercury levels soaring past 42°C at eight towns in the state on Tuesday.

 According to the   ( ), Surendranagar in   was the hottest place in the state with a maximum temperature of 44°C. Rajkot followed at 43°C. Ahmedabad city was also scorchingly hot at 42.9°C on Tuesday, 1.3 degrees above normal. The minimum temperature recorded was 28.2°C, 1.3 degrees above normal. Relative humidity levels ranged between 23% and 57% on Tuesday. Light dust storms were also reported in various parts of the city and at other places in the state.
 
 Weather officials attributed the dust storms and partially cloudy weather in the evening to an upper air cyclonic circulation over south-east   and adjoining north-west Madhya Pradesh. This cyclonic circulation will not bring any relief as there is no possibility of rain in the state.
 
 According to the IMD, there will be no big changes in maximum temperatures in the region for the next two or three days. “Maximum temperatures will remain in the 41°C to 43°C range in north Gujarat, parts of Saurashtra-Kutch and south Gujarat for the next two to three days,” said the IMD forecast. The maximum temperature in Ahmedabad city may hover around 42°C on Wednesday.
