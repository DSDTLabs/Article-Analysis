MUMBAI: The   creek   that connects the city to Gujarat and Delhi by road, has been   for vehicles from Thursday morning, eight months after it was partially closed for  .

 Work on rehabilitating the bridge that had developed a crack on a horizontal girder had begun in February. After work was completed on Saturday, the two-lane south-bound bridge was completely shut for four days from May 14 for observation. The was being used for both up and down light vehicles.
 
 A National   Authority of India ( NHAI) official told TOI the bridge had been declared safe for vehicular movement. 
 
 Massive pile-up of vehicles was reported on the   national highway since the past few months. Motorists were caught up in traffic jams for over two hours on Thursday. The traffic snarl spread to the Dahisar check naka and Western Express Highway.
 
 North and south-bound vehicles were running at a restricted speed of 20 kmph on the bridges in a gap of 10 minutes during the partial closure. The speed restrictions have now been discontinued. Heavy vehicles that were diverted via Thane-Bhiwandi will also be allowed to ply on the old bridge.
 
 A crack was noticed in the 43-year-old 48.5-metre bridge during inspection of bridges across the state following the Mahad bridge collapse in August that killed 28 people.
 
 Ramboll, a Denmark-based consultancy company that has done the rehabilitation had recommended truss (diagonal, triangular bars) to support the bridge. The Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) shot down the recommendation fearing that it would affect marine traffic, including coastal security.
