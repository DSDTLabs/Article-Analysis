NAGPUR: They call him ‘crisis man’ in Vidarbha because of his ability to soak the pressure. Since he came to the Vidarba fold,   has played some crucial knocks whenever the chips were down or wicket is doing some tricks. Be it his hundred against Delhi at Jamtha or his 99 against Odisha on a tricky Sambalpur wicket.

 
 The situation was similar on Tuesday, albeit in a different format. The AOC stadium in Hyderabad was slow in nature and the shot making was difficult. Jammu &Kashmir might be struggling with the bat but there is no problem with their bowling attack, which has surprised many fancied teams in the country.
 
 To score at the strike rate of 103.29 and score almost 40% of the run of the side need some talent. Satish has plenty of it. The former India Under-19 batsman hit an excellent 91-ball 94, which had 12 boundaries and a six, and helped Vidarbha score a competitive 245 in 49 overs. Bowlers, led by left-arm pacer  , then did the job with precision and bowled Jammu & Kashmir for 172 in 38.4 overs to script a 73-run victory against in their second Group ‘D’ match of the Vijay Hazare One-day tournament.
 
 J & K skipper Ian Dev Singh won the toss and put Vidarbha in. The wicket had something in it for the bowlers early on. Pacer Mohammed Mudhasir struck on the first ball of the innings to castle Vidarbha skipper  . Vidarbha had to adopt the cautious approach early on.   (29, 40b, 2x4) and Jitesh Sharma (41, 65b, 4x4) did exactly that. They saw through the spells of Mudhasir and Ram Dayal with their solid 70-run second wicket stand.
 
 However, both got out in space of 12 balls adding just eight runs on the board to leave Vidarbha struggling. Satish then put his hand up t bail Vidarbha out or trouble. Instead of getting bogged down, he mixed precaution with aggression to take the Vidarbha innings forward. Satish had 44-run stand with allrounder Jangid and 31-run association with Apoorv Wankhade.
 
 Wankhade’s run out pegged back Vidarbha’s progress but Satish and allrounder Karn Sharma (26, 30b, 2x4) played sensibly to add 52 for the sixth wicket. Sharma again got out when Vidarbha were looking to push the scoring rate. When Satish got out, six short of his fifth List A hundred, Vidarbha lower order could add just 11 more runs.
 
 Vidarbha bowlers had something to bowl at. Wagh struck in his first two overs to send back debutants Ishtiaq Elahi and Umar Nissar.   also struck twice in successive overs and got the wickets of Pranav Gupta and skipper Singh to leave J & K struggling. Allrounders   and Manzoor Dar, who is recently picked by Kings XI Punjab in the   auction, also couldn’t do much. Except for the 74-run stand between Bandeep Singh (53, 67b, 6x4, 1x6) and Ram Dayal (55, 80b, 7x4, 1x6), J&K batsmen hardly offered any fight.
 
 Karn Sharma chipped in with a couple of crucial wickets in the middle, while young Yash Thakur bagged two wickets in the end to wrap up the J&K innings. Vidarbha will now play against hosts Hyderabad on Thursday.
