RAJKOT: The six accused, including the owner of   Dinesh Selani, in the last weekâ€™s massive fire that gutted 1.36 lakh bags (35kg each) of groundnut worth Rs 28 crore stored in the warehouse near   town in Rajkot, were produced before Gondal magistrate on Tuesday night.

 They were sent to five-day remand. The accused were arrested for negligence and violating safety rules. Even before forensic science experts submitted their report, the state CID crime on Tuesday ruled out conspiracy in the accident. DIG  , who is leading the probe, said the fire was caused by a spark from the welding machine that was in use on the warehouse gate.
 
 This groundnut stored in the warehouse was procured by   (Gujcot) on behalf of National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed) at minimum support price of Rs 900 per 20kg.
