BHUBANESWAR: A day after the   granted bail to gangster  , who is in jail for alleged murder of judo coach Biranchi Das, the latter's widow Gitanjali and an Ollywood actress Leslie Tripathy claimed they feel   to their lives. 

 "We are afraid ever since we heard that he has been granted bail. We want police protection," said Gitanjali. 
 
 On April 13, 2008, Das was shot dead near his house here. After eluding the police for several days, Acharya was caught from Goa.
 
  In 2011, a local court here held the gangster guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment. He contested the verdict in   High Court. While the hearing in high court is still awaited, he moved the Supreme Court. Sources said Raja is likely to be released from jail within a week. 
 
 Biranchi coached Budhia Singh, who went on to become a child marathoner and running sensation and also inspired a Bollywood film. 
 
 Twin cities police commissioner Y B Khurania said there is no need to fear. "Police will provide protection to the witnesses and Biranchi's widow if they approach them," said the commissioner, adding they will also go through the Supreme Court's bail order before deciding future course of action. 
 
 Sources said Gitanjali and others expressed similar apprehensions after the gangster was released on parole following his mother's death in April, 2015. Raja is said to have unrequited love for Leslie. He used to terrorise people coming forward to defend her. Biranchi became the gangster's target after he suspected that the judo coach was the one providing protection to Leslie. "I have every reason to feel insecure. Given his past, we would like to seek police help," Leslie told a private news channel.
