Chennai: The Resolution Professional (IRP) has sought expression of interest (EOI) or initial plans from bidders to revive the beleaguered homestay startup Stayzilla.

The vendor then dragged Stayzilla, to the NCLT seeking its liquidation. After multiple legal wrangles, the RP has now started process to find a bidder. 
 
 Vasupal told TOI that he will start reaching out to investors and other potential bidders to bid for the asset aggressively. “I have had some relationship within the startup ecosystem and will reach out to everyone. I will welcome their interest and make them understand the value of the company. It is up to the resolution applicant now. We can only assist them in understanding how Stayzilla can be utilised,” said Vasupal. “The company has not been operational for over a year. There are assets, the brand and a pending patent. It is up to the resolution applicant as to how they would look at Stayzilla fitting within their existing boutique of brands,” said Yogendra Vasupal, founder of the startup.
 
 The company is estimated to have debt of Rs 13 crore which includes owings to financial creditors. “Today, I will start reaching to everyone. As of now, I want to ensure this process is successful for benefit of all creditors,” he said.
