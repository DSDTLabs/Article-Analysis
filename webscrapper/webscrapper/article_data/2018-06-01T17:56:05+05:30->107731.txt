Watch ' ', a play about four students, at the   on May 27, at 7 pm. The play highlights the plight of four school students who try their best to make the adults around them to listen to their problems. Everyone is so caught up with the 'rat race' that they often ignore what youngsters have to say. The students are shown to have been given one chance to put forth their views in a class presentation. Will the adults listen to them?

 This 55 minute  , which has young students as actors, has been appreciated a great deal.
