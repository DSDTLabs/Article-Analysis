NEW DELHI: To keep your bat grounded in the crease while the ball is in play is amongst the first rules that any batsman is taught while he is learning the nuances of the game. More so when you have the great   as your team coach. 

 But that was not to be as   forgot to ground his bat after a close leg-before appeal off the bowling of  . And  , standing in the slips, was alert enough to knock down the stumps.

 Raina has loads of experience and is a great fielder to boot while Pant is still a new, emerging kid on the block, but he should have shown more alertness at this level.
