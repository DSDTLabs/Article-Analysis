The rake for the UDAY (Utkrisht Double-decker Air-conditioned Yatri) Express train, which is going to be operated between Coimbatore and Bengaluru, has been churned out from the carriage and wagon workshop in Perambur on Saturday, Southern Railway has said. Former railway minister Suresh Prabhu had announced that a day-time double-decker express train would be run between Coimbatore and Bengaluru. However, it had been delayed due to non-availability of the rake. The refurbished UDAY coaches are equipped with infotainment system with WiFi, GPS based passenger information system with seven dedicated LCD displays and passenger-friendly fittings in toilets. There will be a dedicated vending machine with dining facilities in four coaches of the rake. Each coach can accommodate about 115-120 passengers. Another rake is also getting ready at the workshop. The work has been designed by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF), a senior official said. At present, a double-decker service is running between Chennai and Bengaluru.
