KANPUR: The authorities of Etawah lion safari have placed swings in the enclosure of cubs Sultan and Simba to keep them fit and active. 

 The cubs, both male, born in October 2016 to Jessica and  , now weigh 25 kg each. 
 
 Jessica was brought in December 2015, Manan in 2014 from Gujarat. Jessica had conceived in May 2016. She gave birth to two male cubs on October 5, 2016.
 
 Safari officials said that the cubs are becoming more agile, play with each other, pouncing and climbing in their enclosure and spending time with their mother each day. "They are growing quickly and have become quite active. Keeping their growing stage in mind, we have installed swings made of ropes and tyres in the enclosure. The cubs jump and climb and grab the swings with their claws. In this way, they burn extra calories and also increase their stamina and become agile and active," deputy director of lion safari Anil Patel said. 
 
 Both the cubs are now little carnivores, at times they even challenge their mother to get an extra bite. They are receiving 1 to 1.5 kg of natural balance diet daily.
 
 "As the cubs grow, we will work on behavioural training such as sit, down, rise up and target. This will help us in their daily care and management," a keeper said. 
 
 It might be noted that similar session was organised for big cats at safari by a two-member team from Longleat Safari Park of UK in February.
 
 The state government had sought help from Britain for better upkeep of lions at the safari after the back-to-back death of big cats.
 
 The experts had explained the keepers and forest staff how games can make big cats agile and flexible. 
 
 In the wild, the cubs begin hunting at 11 months but remain with their mother for at least two years. The lion safari has also witnessed the death of five adults (two lions and two lionesses) in the past, besides the death of five cubs.
