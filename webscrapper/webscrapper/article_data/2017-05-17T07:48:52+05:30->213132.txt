CHANDIGARH: ADGP Harpreet Singh  , chief of the anti-drug special task force ( ) told   that his team has a free hand to go after the big fish or tackle politicians, provided there is adequate proof to establish a link. “However, these recommendations are not conclusive to the drug problem and the menace has to be tackled at various levels. Enforcement itself has various levels – peddler level, that of consumers, mid-supplier and the big supplier level.”

 “The focus cannot be only the big supplier, though it can get good publicity. The STF is working on a three-pronged strategy. For one, all of them cannot be got together and secondly consumers will still be available,” said Sidhu.
 
 “Rehabilitation and de-addiction is as important because people who are already consuming it need to be weaned away otherwise they will switch to some other form of drugs. The third thing is to stop new people from getting hooked on to drugs as this could keep the demand alive. By adopting this comprehensive approach, we are knitting a wide net and tightening it. As and when he get hold of the big fish, we have a clear mandate to deal with them. We are at it,” added the  .
