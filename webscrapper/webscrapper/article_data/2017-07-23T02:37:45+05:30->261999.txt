GHAZIABAD: Burglars made off with gold   worth Rs 12 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh in   from the house of a retired businessman in Kavi Nagar on Saturday afternoon. The burglary took place when the family was away for a senior citizens’ programme.

 Gopal Mishra (69) lives with his wife, son, daughter-in-law, daughter and grandchildren and used to have a property business. On Saturday, he had gone to attend a senior citizens’ programme with his wife and grandchildren around 11.30am. His son was away at work, while his daughter-in-law, who is a teacher, was also in school.
 
 Around 2pm, his daughter-in-law phoned Mishra and said she had forgotten the keys of the house at home. She requested him to come and unlock the main door of the house. When Mishra reached home and unlocked the door, he found it in complete disarray. The locks of several cupboards were broken, and their contents scattered on the floor.
 
 According to Mishra, 400gm of gold jewellery and about Rs 1.5 lakh in cash was missing. “It appears they entered the house from the service lane behind my house around 11.30am after breaking the lock on the rear door. They had enough time to go through the entire house, because everything was in complete chaos when I arrived,” Mishra said.
 
 The police said an FIR had been filed and an investigating had started.
