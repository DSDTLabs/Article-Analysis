MUMBAI: For the first time this year, the Air Quality Index ( ) recorded in Mumbai on Sunday was 63, which falls in the ‘good’ category.

 Real-time monitoring by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) showed the AQI at 69 in the morning but it went down to 63 by evening. An AQI between 0-100 falls under the ‘good’ category, which means no cautionary measures need to be taken.
 
 Mumbai’s readings were the best among four cities SAFAR monitors, the others being Delhi, Pune and Ahmedabad. Delhi, with an AQI of 309, was the worst. Sunday’s recordings were a relief to Mumbai, which barely five days back recorded an AQI of 275. An AQI of 201-300 is considered poor and could be harmful to sensitive people. The high AQI levels were coupled with thick haze. Officials said it was moisture in the wind which dried up and winds picking up speed led to the drop in AQI levels.
 
 Last year, AQI readings had dropped to 35 on October 12, which was the lowest since SAFAR began recording in June 2015.
 
 Meanwhile, minimum and maximum temperatures recorded in the city were below normal, despite   in interior parts of Maharashtra. Ajay Kumar, scientist at IMD Mumbai, said temperatures were low due to wind direction. “Currently, north-westerly winds are bringing in cool air. This is due to the western disturbance, which give such north-westerly winds,” said Kumar. The hail was unlikely to have any impact over Mumbai, he said.
 
 On Sunday morning, the minimum   recorded by IMD Santacruz was 17.8 degrees Celsius, which was normal, while at Colaba it was 20.5 degrees, which was 0.6 degrees below normal. This was close to that recorded on Saturday, when the minimum recorded by IMD Colaba was 20.6 degrees and Santacruz was 17.4 degrees.
