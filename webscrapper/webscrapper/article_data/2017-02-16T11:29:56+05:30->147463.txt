KANNUR: The Kerala State Human Rights Commission ( ) has sought reports from the district collector, commandant of the   ( ) at Ezhimala in the district, and also the district medical officer, following the complaints by the local residents of Ramanthali, bordering the academy, that the drinking water there is getting contaminated due to the seepage from the sewage tanks in the Academy.

 During a sitting of the Commission here on Wednesday, KSHRC acting chairman P Mohanadas sought the reports, as the complainants said the water gets contaminated due to the improper functioning of the sewage treatment plant in the Naval Academy. They said no action has been taken by the authorities to address the issue, and there is the fear of communicable diseases spreading in the locality where life has become miserable due to this problem.
 
 According to the action committee, apart from foul smell, there is a visible change in the colour of groundwater in the places bordering the academy in Ramanthali. However, the INA authorities are not taking any steps to address the problem, they said.
 
 Though the INA officials claimed the sewage treatment plant is functioning perfectly and they are ready for any kind of tests to assure its functionality, the local residents claimed the plant has the capacity to handle a population of only 600 people, whereas there are over 5,000 people residing in INA now.
 
 The action committee demanded the authorities to relocate the plant from the residential area, and also increase the capacity.
