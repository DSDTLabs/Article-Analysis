VADODARA: The   ( ) has had to invite expressions for interest for free   for the second time. 

 The civic body is looking to provide free access to government site and   for a limited period.
 
 VMC had invited bids for the first time a couple of weeks back for setting up intelligent smart poles in the city that will provide wi fi at prominent locations to citizens amongst other services. But only two vendors showed interest in the project and only one of them was found technically qualified. This forced the VMC to invite bids again.
 
 VMC IT director Manish Bhatt said that the proposal for the project had been revised and model had been tweaked slightly to ensure that more vendors came up for bidding for the project. “We have discussed the project with the ministry of urban development too and taken their suggestions,” he said.
 
 The poles installed for the purpose will have digital signboards, public address system, sensors for weather and traffic and other facilities. Telecom service providers will be given space on the poles for setting up their equipment. Bhatt said that the city needed at least 300 more cell sites and the poles that would be aesthetically appealing could be used for the purpose.
 
 The vendor taking up the project will be able to generate revenue through advertising on the poles, rentals from telecom service providers and charges for Wi-Fi after the limit of free usage expires. The vendor will also pay an amount to the civic body thus generating some revenue for VMC.
