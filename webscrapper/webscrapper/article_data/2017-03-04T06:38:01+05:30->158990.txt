GHAZIABAD: A 16-year-old boy was arrested on Friday for allegedly raping an eight-year-old girl at   in Sahibabad. According to the girl’s mother, the accused, who is her landlord’s son, allegedly lured the child into a room and raped her on February 26.

 “On Sunday afternoon my daughter had gone out to play. When she returned she looked shocked and dishevelled but did not say anything,” girl’s mother said, adding, “The next day she confided to her friends that the landlord’s son had done ‘bad things’ to her and only then did we come to know of the crime.”
 
 She said, “When we questioned her she told me that when she was returning home on Sunday evening the landlord’s son took her to a vacant room and raped her. Following this, I lodged a complaint against him.”
 
 An FIR under sections 376 (rape), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and also under the POCSO Act was registered against the accused on Thursday.
 
 However, the father of the accused claimed his son has been falsely implicated because he had had a dispute with the minor’s family over rent. “About four days ago I had an altercation with my tenant over non-payment of rent. Owing to that, they have levelled such a charge against my son,” he said.
 
 “My son is in Class X. Three years ago he suffered a blood clot in his head for which he is being treated even now. With this condition he could not have done anything as serious as rape,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the girl has been sent for a medical examination and the report is awaited. “We filed an FIR on the basis of a complaint by the survivor’s mother against the accused,” said Dhirender Yadav, SHO of Sahibabad police station.
