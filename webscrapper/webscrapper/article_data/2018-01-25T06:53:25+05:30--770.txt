In all 100 institutions applied for the status which includes premier institutions like IITs, IISc and universities like Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University, among others.
 
 Unlike other universities in the country, these institutions will have the liberty to enrol up to 30% foreign students. Moreover, selected public institutions will be able to recruit up to 25% foreign faculty, while there will be no such limit for selected private institutions. The universities will have the freedom of devising their own courses, create centres without coming to UGC, fix their own fee structure, but with a ‘need blind’ mechanism so that the best students are not denied education for fund crunch.
