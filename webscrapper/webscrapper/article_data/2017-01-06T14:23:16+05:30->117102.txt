 NCP’s Praful Patel is pulling out all the stops to win the council polls in Gondia and Tiroda. NCP had bitten the dust in the four councils in Bhandara district in the polls held last month. It is imperative for him to win the two towns in Gondia district to salvage his pride.
 
 After three phases of municipal council elections, BJP is at the top with maximum number of seats and maximum posts of council presidents, followed by Congress and NCP.
