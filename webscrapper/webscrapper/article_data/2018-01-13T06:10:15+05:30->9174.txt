HYDERABAD: Huge concerns regarding data protection, privacy and commercialisation were raised by various stakeholders before   at public consultation meet held at   on Friday. 

 IT experts and data security researchers demanded the Centre include safeguards to protect data researchers against issues like FIRs stoked by   in   case. It was suggested the age after which parental consent not be required for data access of a child be fixed between 13-15 years. 
 
 Experts advocated that mobile apps, despite securing approval while being installed, should seek permission each time they use data for a purpose other than for which it was downloaded. So far, the committee has held consultations with stakeholders in Delhi and Hyderabad and will do so in Bengaluru on January 13 and Mumbai on January 23.
 
 Data security researcher   said, "Every institution should classify the data it holds into various categories like highly confidential, confidential and public data. We also raised the issue of an FIR being registered against a journalist who exposed security breach in Aadhaar database. We sought protection at least for researchers and journalists who report such breaches."
 
 "The consent of individuals for sharing personal data was also discussed. Every time an app uses information, the individual should be notified. Consultations regarding data being imported from another country too were held," said data expert Kandakuri Surya. It was opined that any breach, encrypted or open, be viewed as a privacy breach. However, exemptions were sought keeping in mind national interests.
