MUMBAI: The Bombay   has backed the rights of pedestrians over that of hawkers while hearing a PIL on encroachment of hawkers on footpaths and compulsory open spaces.

 A bench of Justices Vidyasagar Kanade and P R Bora directed a PIL by Macchindra Karalkar on behalf of residents of buildings on Irla Society Road, Vile Parle (W) to be heard with several petitions filed by hawkers' union, claiming the right to business on the basis of certain rights, which are “allegedly created in their favour'' by the Street Vendors' Act, 2014.
 
 “All these matters will have to be heard together, so that rights of pedestrians can be protected before any rights are created in favour of hawkers,'' said the judges.
 
 Karalkar's PIL complained about illegal extensions by shops and restaurants and how it was not only impossible for pedestrians to walk on footpaths but it also affected the security of residents and public during fire hazards. His petition said that since 2005, open areas said that since 2005, open areas were encroached upon by shopkeepers by illegally extending premises. Thereafter, several chawls got converted into large commercial establishments and showrooms with godowns and huge water tanks. Following the HC's rap, BMC withdrew a statement in its affidavit that said it was a “commercial practice'' for shopkeepers and vendors to display some goods in front of shops to attract customers.
 
 Karalkar's advocate, Veena Thadani, said 29 demolition notices were issued by K (West) ward to shopkeepers and landlords, and while three encroachments were demolished, stays were obtained from a lower court on 26. “Even if action is taken, they are back after a few weeks. As if some right is conferred on them. There is no place for the public to walk,'' Thadani added. Justice Kanade remarked, “This problem was solved in London long time ago. Here it is difficult.''
