HYDERABAD: Police nabbed one of the chief qazis' of Mumbai, Farid Ahmed Khan, while probing a 16-year-old victim's case. The parents of the   based victim lodged a complaint with   police in August. Rukhsar, a minor from Falaknuma, was married to a 65-year-old rich Omani sheikh in the city on May 16. The marriage certificate was issued in Mumbai, which gave a vital clue to cops. "Her family lodged acomplaint alleging that Rukhsar was being ill-treated by the sheikh and she wants to return," Falaknuma inspector Khader Jilani said.

 Rukhsar's parents said all they wanted was a better life for their daughter. "We are poor.We do not have enough money to send our children to proper schools. I'm forced to send my other daughter and son to government school," Syeeda Unnisa Begum, mother of the victim, told TOI. The family claimed the victim's aunt, Ghousia Begum, had proposed the marriage with the sheikh. "I did not know that she was also a broker. She lured us by saying that our daughter will be happy and will never face financial problems like we do," she said.
 
 The broker was paid around Rs 5 lakh. "They just gave us aHonda Activa and a cooler. Later, we found out that she (the broker) was paid lakhs," said Syeed Afzar, the victim's father.
 
 The family said, the Omani sheikh showed them videos of malls in Muscat, Dubai and his plush villas. After marriage, he stayed at a hotel for four days with his minor bride and sexually exploited her, police said.
 
 Ghousia's husband Sikandar Khan arranged passports and papers for the victim to fly to Oman. "Last time, we talked to Rukhsar was almost two months ago. She wasn't well. She was crying and begging us to take her home. We visit Sikandar's house everyday asking for help. Now, I do not know where my daughter is.We are worried," Syeeda said.
