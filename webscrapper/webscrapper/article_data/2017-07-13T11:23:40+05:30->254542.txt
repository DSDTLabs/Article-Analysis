CHANDIGARH: A court here on Tuesday directed   to get the two men arrested in the UT teachers’ recruitment scam medically examined every 24 hours after it was alleged that the accused were tortured and harassed in police custody.

 The court of civil judge  , while extending the police remand of main accused  , alias Guruji, and co-accused Shiv Bahadur, directed police to submit the reports of all medical examinations of the duo to it. Though police had sought seven-day custody of the accused, the court turned down the request. Seeking their remand, the police’s counsel said the two accused were sharp-minded and investigators were having a tough time in getting information out of them.
 
 The defence counsel, however, said police had already taken their remand and there was no need for it any further. Pleading that the accused be remanded in judicial custody, the defence counsel said the duo should now be questioned after other accused are arrested.
 
 Police also stated in court that they had taken the duo to the press in New Delhi from where the paper was leaked. The police’s counsel said investigators had gotten tip-offs from there and they would soon arrest more accused. Police said the duo had been putting all blame of the scam on Kamleshwar, an accused who had recently passed away. Srivastav is also known as   and Masterji.
 
 The case dates to July 29 last year. Then, Chandigarh Police had registered FIR in the case of paper alleged leak of question papers of selection tests in January and February last year, for the recruitment of 1,150 junior basic training (JBT), trained graduate teachers (TGTs) and nursery training teachers(NTTs).
