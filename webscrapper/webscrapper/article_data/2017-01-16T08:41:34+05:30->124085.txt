DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand is set to get its first three-dimensional (3D) speed breaker at Race Course in Dehradun. The virtual speed breaker in the form of 3D painting is expected to curb the menace of rash driving.
 
  On a trial basis, 3D effect is being given to an existing speed breaker at Race Course. The Public Works Department ( ) got in touch with   ( ) to collaborate with the Delhi Street Art (DSA), a group of artists and 3D designers to assist in painting and designing the speed breaker.
  
  PWD official Sarin Kumar said that the existing speed breaker on the road does not have high visibility. “The 3D speed breaker will create an optical illusion to ensure people slow down their vehicles. If the trial attempt is a success, we may collaborate with DSA for 3D speed breakers in the city.”
  
  DSA founder   added, “The 3D design basically uses a special paint on the road for the optical illusion.”
