Trichy: Touted as the model park for other small recreational centres in the city, the upcoming Corporation Park on Royals Road is most likely to be thrown open to public in a week’s time. With the majority of the work completed, corporation sources said that the recreational centre will be first of its kind to have an ATM near the entrance of the park. The rent collected from the ATM space will be used to meet the maintenance expenses of the park.

 Close to 10,000 square feet of land adjacent to Royals Road remained unutilised for years, the Urban Local Body (ULB) a few weeks ago took up the beautification works to install a model park in the area.
 
 Comprising exclusive space for walking track, mini amphitheatre with seating capacity for 70 members and play area for children, the park on Royals Road has been given a facelift at an estimated cost of Rs43 lakhs.
 
 “For the first time, a lot of amenities have been incorporated under one roof at the Royals Road Park. Based on the patronage, similar such model parks might be expanded to other zones. Since people in the Cantonment locality do not have much places to hang out, we even established ‘8’ shaped walking track,” a senior official with Trichy Corporation said.
 
 Officials said that 80 per cent of work has been completed including the mini amphitheatre facility. Minimal works such as completion of landscaping and raising the height of fences are in pending. 
 
 Besides the urinal and toilet established, the park is also facilitated with a shelter for people to take cover during rain. The civic body also covered one portion of the boundary walls of the park with colourful paintings imparting environmental awareness to the public.
