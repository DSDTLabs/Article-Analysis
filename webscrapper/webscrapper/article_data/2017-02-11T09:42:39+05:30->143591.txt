VADODARA: The   (VMC) will be sprucing up four more ponds in the coming days. The standing committee on Friday gave nod to rejuvenate three ponds even as the futuristic planning cell of the civic body invited bids for one more water body.

 VMC had recently decided to give a facelift to all the ponds within the city limits. It also took suggestions from experts and prominent citizens in this regard by forming a group that visited all ponds in the city and gave its feedback on steps that can be taken to spruce them up.
 
 The standing committee cleared proposals for developing the Vasna pond,   pond in Gorwa and the   in Manjalpur area. The allocation of funds for works on ponds had been made in last yearâ€™s budget. The development of ponds was taken up as a part of giving the city a unique identity under the   initiative of the state government.
 
 VMC has proposed walkways, entrance gates, sitting arrangements, gazebos and green spaces at the ponds along with parking space. Close to Rs 1.75crore will be spent on the Vasna pond, Rs one crore on Mahisagar pond and Rs 42.66lakh on the Kotar Talavdi, which is much smaller.
 
 The civic body has also invited bids for the development of the Mahadev pond in Wadi. The pond has an island like space in its middle which is accessible with a pathway. There is a VMC community hall in the middle of the pond on this structure.
 
 VMC estimates that it will have to spend Rs 82.74lakh on the project. But the final amount will be decided only after the bids are made by February 22 and subsequent negotiations with the contractors.
