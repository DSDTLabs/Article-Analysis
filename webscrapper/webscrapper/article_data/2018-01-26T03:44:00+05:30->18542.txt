NEW DELHI: The   has issued notices to the Centre and all the states/UTs on the issue of vehicular pollution affecting the respiratory system and even the reproductive health of traffic cops. 

 
 Taking cognisance of an application filed by Dr  , an expert on road traffic hazards,   has also stated that most of the state governments don’t provide any extra allowances or health facilities to the   personnel. 
 
 Kulshreshtha had sought NHRC’s intervention while raising the issue of right to health of the personnel of traffic police across the country, stating that the high air pollution is causing reduced life expectancy among them. The commission has asked Union home secretary and chief secretaries of all the states to send a detailed response in the matter within eight weeks. 
 
 In his application to NHRC chairman Justice (retd) H L Dattu on January 4, Dr Kulshreshtha said traffic policemen are the worst sufferers of vehicular pollution because they perform duties at crossings where pollution is maximum. “If we stand at some moderately busy crossing and start counting total number of vehicles passing from all four directions in his duty hours, we may find that their number is anywhere between 1-2 lakhs or even more, ” Dr Kulshreshtha said in the application. 
 
 He also mentioned that studies have shown that within 5-6 years these policemen develop pollution induced diseases. “In cases where the posting place is in the heavily polluted area, these diseases can develop much earlier. This vehicular pollution mainly affects their respiratory system, however, there is no part or system in the body which is immune to it. Besides, they are also prone to have some other diseases like cardiac, skin, migraine and even reproductive system. All these cause significant morbidity, affecting the quality of life and also the life expectancy,” he adds.
