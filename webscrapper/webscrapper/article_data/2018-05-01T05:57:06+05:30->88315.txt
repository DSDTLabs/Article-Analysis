MUMBAI: Parents of Dadar's Shardashram Vidyamandir were in for a surprise when their children received mark sheets with SVM international School printed on them. The parents have been protesting a move for the school to migrate from the state board to the ICSE. 

  The school, which has gifted the country cricketing heroes such as   Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli, had sought permission from the state education department for changing its name and starting the ICSE curriculum for classes I to V. However, parents have protested the plan and claimed the sudden change would not be in the interest of the students. "The mark sheets were from SVM International School. The school got permission for name change only recently so my child has completed class II from Sharadashram Vidyamandir but that isn't what the mark sheet says. We heard that the school still hasn't got permission from BMC for changing the name," said a parent. 
 
 Sainath Durge, member of the  , said, "The primary section is governed by the BMC education department but the school did not take permission for name change from them."
 
 Subhash Jadhav, administrative officer of the school, did not respond to calls from TOI. BMC education officer Mahesh Palkar said, "The proposal to change the school's name was received recently. However, the school will not be allowed to shut down the SSC section in one year."
