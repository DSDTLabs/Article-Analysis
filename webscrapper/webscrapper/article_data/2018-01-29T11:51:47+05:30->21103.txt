BAREILLY: Expressing his displeasure over bringing down of a   billboard near the   flyover on January 26, former mayor I S Tomar on Sunday criticised his   successor and alleged that the later was a defaulter of house tax and had encroached upon government land.
 
  “Mayor   has encroached upon 5,900 square metre of government land in Rajauraraspur village to build his university. It is revealed by a government inquiry, and he too has admitted this. He should vacate that land before initiating anti-encroachment drive,” said Tomar.
  
  On January 25, Tomar had got two billboards — displaying photos of former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and Tomar thanking people — erected at both ends of the newly-constructed flyover. However, within 24 hours,   Municipal Corporation ( ) officials removed the billboards, terming them “unauthorised and illegal” that left Tomar and SP workers infuriated.
  
  Tomar claimed that during his tenure, UP Bridge Corporation engineers had completed the construction of the flyover within a year despite odd circumstances. “When the flyover was started, BJP ministers and mayor came forward to take credit and hogged limelight.”
  
  “It was me who had dreamt of a flyover and discussed the matter with the then CM, who took no time in giving his approval to ease city’s traffic. It was really very disappointing to hear finance minister  , who claimed that he gave me the idea of a flyover at the Shyamatganj crossing. The fact is he never discussed it with me,” Tomar said.
  
  “In April 2016, when the former CM announced the flyover during his Bareilly visit, a section of politicians had protested. But, today, the same people have no shyness in taking credit for the flyover,” Tomar added.
