NASHIK: A three-member police team from Kerala visited   police station on Monday to garner details about the death of   Roy Mathew (33) - found hanging from the ceiling of an abandoned barrack within the premises of Artillery Centre at Deolali. 

 Confirming the development, Nashik commissioner of police Ravinder Kumar Singal said the team had come in connection with Roy's death. "The Kerala police needs some documents related to the cause of Roy's death. We have shared the details with them," he added.
 
 The senior IPS officer said a police officer from Deolali Camp police station is investigating the case along with the defence officials. "Our investigating team is in touch with the Kerala police with respect to the investigation," Singal said.
 
 The Nashik police said the post mortem conducted in Nashik indicated that hanging was the cause of Roy's death. On being asked about the second autopsy conducted in Kerala, an officer said, "We are not in any position to comment on the issue due to the lack of expertise in the subject."
 
 He added, "The team has left Nashik after getting the details. It could not be ascertained if the Kerala police team met any local   authorities."
 
 Roy was found hanging from the ceiling of an abandoned barrack within the premises of the Article Centre. He was missing since February 25. The body was located on March 3.
 
 A video featuring Roy had gone viral in which he along with other soldiers were shown walking dogs and taking their children to school. The video was part of the sting operation conducted by a news website criticizing the 'sahayak' system in the army. After the video went viral, the jawan had gone missing.
 
 Roy's family had alleged that there has been foul play in the jawan's death and demanded a thorough probe into the case. The jawan was missing since February 25. His family had complained to the Kerala chief minister and the Army chief on March 1. A day later, the Army confirmed his death.
