NEW DELHI:   of autorickshaws, taxis and Grameen Sewas have decided to   their ‘symbolic’   on Wednesday. They will, however, hold a protest on Wednesday to highlight their demands.

 The primary demand of the unions is an increase in the fare. “Fares have not been hiked while other costs, like insurance, have been going up,” said Rajendra Soni, vice president, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh. Soni also claimed that the prices of CNG testing had gone up, and the frequency of testing had been increased.
 
 Another union demand is to expedite the process of issuing 10,000 new   rickshaw permits promised by the Delhi government. The new permits have been put on hold after complaints were received by the Delhi government that some of the short-listed applicants already held permits.
