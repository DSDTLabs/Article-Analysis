KOLKATA: Police want to track the movement of actor   for the entire evening on April 28 leading up to the   in the wee hours of April 29 in which   Sonika Singh Chauhan was killed. 

 Police sources insist that this will not only help them establish whether Vikram had been drinking, but will also help them know whether he had been driving over a considerable period of time under the influence of alcohol. 
 
 Sources in Tollygunge police said while taking stock of the actor’s activities during the night they found some anomalies in his statements and that given to police by Sonika’s friends. “The last two days were spent in studying statements. Several key questions like who paid the bills and even the reasons why they decided to leave a pub at AJC Bose Road at 2.15am but never returned to Sonika’s residence even after she complained of a headache remain unanswered. Then the   actually changed his statements. We are still finding it difficult to completely trust him in the light of some observations made by those present at the pub. If required, we will reconstruct the incident again,” a source said. Sources said police might meet the public prosecutor as early as Wednesday to discuss “progress” in the case, not ruling out the possibility of adding new sections to the FIR.
 
 The much-anticipated action — coming days after Sonika’s family felt that police were not serious about the   — came after the top brass of police decided to monitor the probe last week. 
 
 The officers, who have gone through the evidence collected by Tollygunge police, have not ruled out further questioning of a few people, including Vikram. Senior officers have asked their legal team to go through similar cases and court judgments while preparing the evidence.
