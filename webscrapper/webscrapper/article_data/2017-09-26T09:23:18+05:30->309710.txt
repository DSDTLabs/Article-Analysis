CHENNAI:  , who shot to limelight after making the final of the javelin throw event in   in London last month, is set to meet   Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore in the first week of October to push for his inclusion in the   ( ) list.

 A few days back, Davinder expressed his disappointment after he was not added to the TOPS list despite bagging a bronze medal at the Asian Athletics Championship and also becoming the first Indian javelin thrower to qualify for the final at the Worlds.
 
 In fact, an emotional Davinder went on to say that he would “even consider moving to Italy” as he has received a lucrative offer from an Italian coach. On Monday, Davinder, who is cur rently taking part in the National open athletics here, stated that he will take up the matter with Rathore. “I'm likely to meet him on October 6. He himself is a legendary shooter and he knows what athletes face in India. I was very disappointed when I wasn't included in the list. The Italian coach who saw me in London recognised my potential, but here it has not happened,” Davinder told TOI.
 
 However, the javeling thrower made it clear that his “heart is with” India and “he will not” move to Italy .”I'm an Army man and my heart is here. I was more disappointed at how things went. The authorities initially told me I would be added to the TOPS list and suddenly I wasn't there. All said, I will not move to Italy,” said the 28year-old.
 
 Ever since his outburst citing his financial constraints, Davinder said he has received enormous support from various quarters. “I'm glad that a lot of people have come forward. People have supported me on social media, two brands have said that they would support me in the upcoming events,” he added.
 
 Davinder, who reached the final of the Worlds with a throw of 84.22m, said his focus is on breaching the 88m mark regularly . Davinder will be in action at the Nehru Stadium on Tuesday .
