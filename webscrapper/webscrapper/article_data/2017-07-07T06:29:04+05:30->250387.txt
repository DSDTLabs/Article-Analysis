KOLKATA: For the first time in over a decade, sale of homes in   has overtaken Rajarhat figures.

 During January-June this year, 33% or one in every three flats sold in Kolkata was located in south Kolkata and its peripheral areas, extending up to Baruipur. Rajarhat, which had consistently topped the sales chart, has slipped to the second spot, contributing to 32% sales, down from a high 42% in January-June 2016. In all, 8,109 units were sold in the first half of 2017, against 10,339 in the corresponding period 2016.
 
 What appears to have fuelled this surge in sales in south Kolkata is flats in the affordable segment--those priced below Rs 50 lakh--that received a boost in the Budget. “Projects in the Narendrapur-Baruipur belt showed good traction in the first half of the year, particularly after February , when the impact of demonetisation began to wane,“ said Samantak Das, chief economist and India director (research) at global realty consultants Knight Frank. Even mid-segment pro jects, priced Rs 50 lakh-Rs75 lakh, in south Kolkata performed better than Rajarhat.
 
 Sushil Mohta, who has projects in Rajarhat and south, confirmed the trend as sales in the two areas had been neck-toneck. “South has the edge as it is more developed, with its proximity to better infrastructure, such as Metro and hospitals.Though land price may be slightly higher in south, compared to that in Rajarhat, the former offers greater value. That may change as infrastructure improves in Rajarhat,“ said Mohta, ex-president of Credai.
 
 The change in customer preference was reflected in new launches. Though the number of projects launched in Rajarhat is still the highest, its share has declined from 46% of all the launches in Kolkata in the first half of 2016 to 36% in January-June 2017. South Kolkata, which accounted for 27% of launches in January-June 2016, has grabbed 32% of the pie this year. Even in inventory and projected sales outlook, Rajarhat fared less favourably . The 14,116 flats, which were either ready or under construction in Rajarhat, would take 11quarters or nearly three years to sell.But the 7,350 units in south Kolkata was likely to sell in seven quarters, or less than 2 years. Overall, Kolkata witnessed 18% drop in launches from 11,891 units in the first half of 2016 to 9,764 in January-June 2017, while sales fell 22% from 10,339 units to 8,109. Inventory went up from 34,426 units in first half of 2016 to 39,114.
 
 Das believed notifying Rera, the act that aimed at ushering in greater transparency and better delivery in the sector, would boost sales by inspiring buyer confidence. “Most states have been proactive in adopting the ground-breaking reform. Rera is particularly important for   as there are a lot of unorganised developers here,“ Das said.
