PANCHKULA: Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN) has purchased two   transformers of 200 KVA each to meet the power demand of residents.

 
 
 UHBVN (city) executive engineer Sanjeev   said, “Earlier we used to tackle the overloading problem in a traditional manner by picking up the faulty   from its place to workshop and fixing it after repairs. This way takes more than four hours to restore the electricity of a particular area.”
 
 “The mobile transformer which are 24x7 ready in our trolleys are easy to commute and will be fixed at the place of faulty transformer and the entire process will be done within minutes. The faulty transformer would be taken to the workshop and will be fixed soon after repairing or if the fault comes at night, the faulty transformer would be fixed next day after repairing and mobile transformer will work on its behalf,” he said.
 
 Problem of power cut/failure occurs due to undeclared heavy load due to installation of air conditioner (AC) by residents.
 
 Sharma said power-related problems will be fixed in minutes with the help of mobile transformers. “City residents can sleep without suffering power cuts in this season. Our motive is to provide best facilities to the city residents.” Power cut problem which occurs during rainy season will also be taken care of with these mobile towers.
