NEW DELHI: Pakistan wicketkeeper batsman   may have missed being a part of Pakistan's   triumph but that doesn't keep him away from action both on and off the field. During an   in Norway - between two women's teams - he was the star attraction, but the experience didn't quite end well for him.

 Facing a delivery from one of the bowlers - a real half-tracker if you may call it - Umar made a mess of it and the ball crashed onto his stumps. By the look of it, he was trying to flick the ball but it deflected and hit his leg-stump. 
 
 
 
  
  
 This is not the first time Umar that has been at the wrong end of an incident. Known to be having a colourful life, Umar has in the past been trolled heavily on social media for his mischievous acts outside the cricket field. In February 2014, Umar was pulled over for rash driving and booked under Section 186, 279 and 353 of the Pakistan Penal Code. The same year, with Pakistan playing a Test against Australia, Umar was spotted dancing at a Pakistan wedding which received a public backlash and resulted in him becoming the butt of all jokes.
 
 Even then it's not as if he has slowed down. Earlier this year, he got into an ugly spat with Pakistan team-mate and fast bowler Junaid Khan during a Pakistan Cup (National One Day) match. During the toss, Umar said that Junaid was replaced by Nasir Nazir and the reason he gave was: "I just found out when I walked into the ground that he [Junaid Khan] is absent. I am very surprised. The manager and coach told me he is not going to be playing today. It is shocking news for me as a captain".
 
 Minutes later, Junaid released a video message expressing his displeasure over what Umar had said. 
 
 Umar also got recently trolled on social media after he posted a picture with a Bentley. "Enjoying London after hard work," he had tweeted.
