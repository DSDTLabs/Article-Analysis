NEW DELHI: The banters between India and Australia players in the ongoing four-Test series refuse to get over as it witnessed another incident with skipper   deciding to give the Aussies the taste of their own medicine on the fourth day of the third Test in Ranchi.

 It all started with Australian all-rounder   mocking Kohli's shoulder injury when he imitated the Indian skipper's action by clutching his right shoulder after a dive to save a boundary in the 81st over on the third day. Kohli was left clutching his right shoulder in pain after he dived while fielding at the mid-on area on Day 1 and later scans revealed that he had suffered a strain.
 
 Having endured a tough penultimate day, Australia came to bat in their second innings after India declared their first innings at a mammoth 603/9. Ravindra Jadeja, in his third over of the day, gave Kohli a chance to give an apt reply to Maxwell by cleaning up   for 14. Jadeja exploited the rough outside both left-handers' off stump to get rid of him.
 
  
 An overjoyed Kohli was seen patting his heavily strapped injured shoulder after Warner's dismissal, an obvious reference to Maxwell's mocking on Saturday.
 
 Australia were in trouble, reeling at 23/2 when the stumps were drawn, trailing India by 129 runs.
