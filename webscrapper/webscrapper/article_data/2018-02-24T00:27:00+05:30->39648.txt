Bhopal: In a gruesome twist to the beheading of a schoolgirl, a 26-year-old man known to her hanged himself from a tree in Kotma village of Anuppur late on Thursday.

 Police aren’t sure if Vijay Prajapati killed himself out of grief after the girl’s murder, or out of guilt because he was the killer. Anuppur SP Sunil Kumar Jain said, “Vijay was known to the girl. We are investigating all aspects, including whether he killed the girl and then committed suicide or if she was murdered by the man who was accused of harassing her in the past.”
 
 Sixteen-year-old Pooja Panika was beheaded with a sword outside her school gates on Thursday afternoon just as she arrived for her biology practicals. She was attacked from behind and there was a lone witness, a retired teacher. None of the students saw the gruesome murder because they were all inside school.
 
 A short while later, police rounded up a suspect, Dilip Sahu, who was named by Pooja’s family in their complaint. A neighbour, he is accused of harassing Pooja and was arrested in 2014 for stalking her. The village was still reeling from the murder when Vijay’s body was found hanging from a tree. Police found out that he was known to Pooja and the two had fallen out recently.
