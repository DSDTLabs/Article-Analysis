VIJAYAWADA: TDP supremo and   chief minister   came down heavily on   on Sunday, calling him a "campaign Prime Minister". 

 
 
  "No one has benefited in the last four years of   government. He's nothing more than a campaign Prime Minister. Till now we have heard only words but there has been no action," Naidu said during his inaugural speech at the TDP's three-day annual plenary, Mahanadu, in Vijayawada. "The Prime Minister does not have any focus on development, all his attention is on publicity for himself. Has anyone benefited from the initiatives like 'Make in India' and 'Startup India'? Instead, the banking sector has got hit, and the country's economy is in doldrums." 
 
 "Modi said he will bring black money stashed abroad back into the country, but instead what we are seeing today is people escaping from the country after cheating banks to the tune of thousands of crores."
