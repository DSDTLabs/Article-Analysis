 Works are already underway for establishing an open air gymnasium each at   in   and Anna Nagar link road along   canal, and two at KK Nagar.
 
 The total cost of installation for each of the open air gymnasium was calculated to be between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 25 lakh. All four proposed gymnasiums were expected to be open in April 2018, officials said. With works on gyms progressing, the ULB plans to set up science park facility in Thennur, this month.
