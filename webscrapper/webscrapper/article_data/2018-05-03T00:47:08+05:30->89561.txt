Salem: Three members of a farmer’s family died in a suicide pact at Pulikaradu near Thammampatti in Attur here on Wednesday as they couldn’t allegedly settle their debt even after selling their farmland and house.

 According to police, the farmer and his second wife fed poison to their two sons before committing suicide by consuming the same. While one of the sons died, the other is battling for life in hospital.
 
 The deceased have been identified as Arjunan, 50, of Pulikaradu, his wife Vennila, 35, and son Prakash, 12. The couple’s second son, Mohan, 10, has been admitted to the Attur government hospital, where his condition is said to be critical.
 
 Police said Arjunan had recently sold three acres farmland and his house at Jangasamudram to settle the debts. The family then moved to Pulikaradu, where Arjunan leased a piece of land to cultivate tapioca.
 
 “Arjunan had over the past few years borrowed heavily to run the family. Since the earnings from the farmland were not adequate to settle the debts and run the family, he was forced to sell his property at Jangasamudram and move to Pulikaradu. The proceeds from the sale were, however, not enough to repay all the loans,” an investigation officer said.
 
 As Arjunan and his family members didn’t come out of the house on Wednesday, neighbours grew suspicious and broke open the door and found the four lying unconscious on the floor.
 
 They immediately informed both the police and Arjunan’s relatives. “By the time we reached the spot, Arjunan, Vennila and Prakash had died. Mohan was battling for life and we took him to the Attur government hospital,’’ the officer said.
 
 Arjunan, the officer said, was married to another woman, Ayyammal, who now lives with the couple’s son Sivakumar. 
 
 “He married Vennila about 14 years ago. Both the women were living with Arjunan in the same house. Only recently did Ayyammal move to Sivakumar’s house at Vazhakondayanur,” the officer added.
