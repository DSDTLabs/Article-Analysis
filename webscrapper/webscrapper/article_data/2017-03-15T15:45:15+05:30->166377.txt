Jayasudha's husband Nitin Kapoor, who is a producer was found dead at his office in Mumbai on March 14. Though any detailed information about the incident is yet to be revealed, news broke that Nithin Kapoor has committed suicide. 

 "Kapoor was jobless for the last 18 years. His family resides in Hyderabad and he was staying in Mumbai at his sister's house," said DCP Ashok Dudhe, a police spokesperson.
 
 He was under depression for the last one-and-a half years and undergoing treatment in a private hospital since February, he said.
 
 No suicide note was recovered from the spot, Dudhe said, adding there was nothing suspicious in the incident.
 
 A case of accidental death report has been registered with the Versova police station, the senior official said.
 
 The reason for Kapoor taking the extreme step was not yet known, police said.
 
 Nitin Kapoor is the cousin of Bollywood actor Jithendra and got married to actress Jayasudha in the year 1985 after two years of love. The couple had maintained a low-key profile always and used to appear together at many events that take place within the industry, including weddings. 
 
 In one of the interviews the couple gave to a leading newspaper earlier, Jayasudha was quoted saying, “From day one I was impressed by his good looks and the way he used to converse. If I say I wasn’t attracted towards him, I would be lying. But, it was not love at first sight. But, yes, I liked him and his company.” And Nitin was quoted saying, “We were good friends with no sparks flying. Our exciting story actually began when I started travelling between Mumbai and Chennai. That was when we felt a void in our lives and started missing each other."
 
 The couple seemed very much in love and were married for 30 years and were survived by two sons-Nihar and Shreayan, who are into film industry. 
 
 More details are awaited.
