Panaji: The death toll from swine flu (H1N1) has increased to ten from the previous figure of nine. A 75-year-old man from North Goa succumbed to the fever last week after brief hospitalization. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar confirmed that ten persons have died of swine flu in the state with a fresh case registered last week. “Any person above the age of 65 faces greater chance of complications on contracting swine flu,” Betodkar said. Of the ten swine flu deaths registered, in about six cases the deceased had comorbid condition that raised the risk bar for them and increased chances of complications arising out of the infection. For a person suffering from conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, or hyper tension, the chance of developing complications after getting swine flu is higher, Betodkar said. Since January, 220 swine flu cases have been registered, including ten deaths. The directorate of health services had warned that there would be a rise in H1N1 cases in September. Betodkar said they expect to see a decline in cases post September. And since swine flu is considered as any other flu, the state would continue to get swine flu cases. “With proper precaution and medication, the disease can be tackled easily,” said Betodkar.
