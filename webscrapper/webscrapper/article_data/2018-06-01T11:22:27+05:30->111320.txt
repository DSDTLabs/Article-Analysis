 In March, TOI reported that for the first time this year, the education department has proposed to change the system of enrolling students in Class XI. The centralised online system used earlier showed discrepancies during the 2017 admission session. While the DEO got Class X students trained in filling online forms, helpdesks will be established in schools for those who find it difficult to fill online forms, said Anujit Kaur, district education officer.
 
 The online system is aimed at saving manpower and making the system error-free. At present, students first fill the form by hand and details are uploaded online later. Under the online system, everything will be online. The new system is expected to eliminate the need for multiple counseling, which has been a great hassle for students and schools.
 
 Like every year, there is only one registration form for all streams (science, commerce, humanities or vocational). The candidate is required to fill only one registration form for any government school. Candidates can fill the option of 20 government schools and streams of their choice in order of preference in the form. 
 
 After filling basic details, a unique ID and Password shall be generated, which the candidate shall have to keep safe for future reference.
