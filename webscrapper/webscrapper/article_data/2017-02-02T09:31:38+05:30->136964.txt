LUCKNOW: While frequent travellers have welcomed surcharge waiver on   through  , they could have done with more relief from the Budget, especially since the railway fare has increased by over 25% in the past three years.

 For instance, a passenger said, the service charge on a sleeper ticket is Rs 20 and on an AC ticket Rs 40 which will now be waived off. In comparison, in 2014, the fare was hiked by 14.2% and in 2015, dynamic pricing was introduced which raised the fare further. 
 
 “I travel from Lucknow to Delhi three times a month for business. In 2015, the AC III ticket for Delhi, including surchage, was Rs 700, which increased to Rs 800 in 2016. Tickets cost more in trains with dynamic pricing. For me, a waiver of Rs 40 is little in comparison to the fare hike,” said Sameer Abbas.
 
 “I often give a tip of Rs 20 while I travel and if Railways is waiving an equivalent amount, it means nothing. If the ministry really wants to change something, they should change the system of flexi-fare. Because of flexi-fare, last year I got a special AC train ticket worth Rs 750 for around Rs 5,500,” said Rishu Chandra, another passenger.
 
 “A person who is booking online is capable of buying a ticket worth Rs 5,000 with his/her card. But if I talk about annual saving with Rs 40, it means a frequent traveller like me would save Rs 5,000 annually. That amount can buy me another ticket or pay for my mobile bill so I am happy with this initiative of Railways,” said Rinkush Tandon.
 
 Passengers said they also wanted some relief in refunding rules on cancellation of tickets. At present, if one cancels a ticket 48 hours before the journey, 25% of the fare is deducted and if it is 12 hours before departure, 50% of the charge is deducted. There is no refund if cancellation is three hours before the journey.
