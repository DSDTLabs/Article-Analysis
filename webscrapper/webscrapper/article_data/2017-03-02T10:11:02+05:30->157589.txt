BENGALURU: Aadhaar cards as age and identity proof may soon be made mandatory for player entries at national-level meets conducted by sports federations. The   hopes this will curb age fraud to a great extent.

 As a first step, the ministry has asked   (NSFs) to follow the example of the   (SGFI) and develop a system to accept competition entries online within three months. SGFI, which went on line years ago, plans to make Aadhaar compulsory from this season not only for entries to its national-level competitions but also for registration of new players.
 
 “In a bid to streamline and adopt a transparent method in selection of players teams in competitions... it is desirable to accept entries of players teams online. All NSFs are required to develop and migrate to online systems within three months. After that, sending and accepting entries should be done online only and in no case should entries be accepted physically . All NSFs will submit compliance reports to the ministry by May 31,” the ministry said in the communique.
 
 The ministry also urged NSFs to seek SGFI's help to develop and maintain online systems. SGFI too has been advised to provide assistance to NSFs if approached.
 
 “We were impressed by the software developed by SGFI and the way it has put certain checks and balances in place. It has made Aadhaar mandatory and will implement it in its camps and while receiving entries for its meets,” sources told TOI.
