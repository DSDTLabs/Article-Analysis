Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has held that customs authorities cannot deny DVDs of   footage to the accused persons who want to prove that they were not smuggling gold at Dabolim airport in 2015.

 A couple had approached the high court after the authorities declined to give the CCTV footage. The petitioners pointed out that the footage is required to prove that they were not given an opportunity to declare gold by the customs on March 12, 2015. According to the duo, they were arrested at the aerobridge ramp at the exit of the aircraft even before they could go to the customs desks to declare the gold.
 
 “It may happen that some of the documents that the accused require are in physical possession, custody or control of the revenue (customs) or of other authorities. That evidence cannot be shut out or kept from the petitioners on the grounds that the revenue has not relied on it,” Justice G Patel and Justice Nutan Sardessai said. 
 
 Customs had declined to give the CCTV footage on the grounds that it had not used it to prove the case against the accused. The court said that the petitioners must be given fullest opportunity to use all available material.
 
 The high court ordered that the copies of the DVDs containing the CCTV footage should be sent to the adjudicating authority, where the case against the petitioners is pending.The court said that the adjudicating authority will reconsider the entire matter afresh in light of these DVDs. Shalu Chadha and Parmindar Singh were arrested after they arrived in Goa by a Qatar Airways flight from Dubai. During the hearing of the case, the petitioner’s lawyer Vivek Rodrigues pointed out that the CCTV footage will prove that there is no smuggling in this case. Customs officials said the petitioners were carrying an amount of gold in excess of the permissible quantity.
