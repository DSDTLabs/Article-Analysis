BHOPAL: In a stern warning, Union surface transport and water resources minister   on Friday said government would not tolerate corruption in the construction of national highways. 

 "Contractors would find themselves under the bulldozer instead of metal, if corruption is detected in construction of national highways," Gadkari said at a convention of labourers and unorganised workers in Betul.
 
 The minister further said construction work should be carried out extensively while ensuring quality. The government has sufficient funds for the development of highway projects. "There is no paucity of funds in the country, but government would not tolerate corruption in the construction works. The only thing that affects the project is lack of technology and technical know-how, besides efforts to work in the right direction. If overcome, these factors would help the country take a lead," he said.
 
 Expressing concern over rising pollution levels, Gadkari said import of petroleum products is creating environmental hazards and people must be aware of its consequences. "The import of petrol-diesel worth over Rs 7 lakh crore is increasing pollution levels in the country. Every part of India is affected. We need to pay attention towards this."
 
 Gadkari stressed farmers are in deep trouble. The Union minister, who hails from Nagpur in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, known for its scarcity of water , said, as a farmer he himself manages four sugar mills that are reeling under debt. "If these mills were closed then BJP would lose four Lok Sabha seats in the region," he claimed.
