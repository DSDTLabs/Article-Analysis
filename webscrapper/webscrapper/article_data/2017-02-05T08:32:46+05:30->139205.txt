TRICHY: Two Class XI girls at a school in Trichy fainted after allegedly being forced to stand in the scorching sun waiting for tourism minister   to come and distribute free bicycles.

 The incident took place at   on Saturday. Class XI students were told to come to school on 8 am on Saturday, a holiday, to receive bicycles for free from the minister as part of a government scheme. The minister, along with revenue officials including the collector, reached the venue after 10 am. The students, Ruba and Pushpa, were rushed to the shade after they fainted and were given water by fellow students and teachers.
 
 Pushpa said she felt sick after standing in the sun for a long time and only felt better after being taken to the shade.
 
 However S Shanthi, chief education officer (in-charge) for Trichy district, said the students were made to wait only for a few minutes before the arrival of the minister. They said the students fainted because they had not eaten their breakfast.
 
 Meanwhile, medical professionals said exposure to sun for a considerable duration reduces   to the brain which causes giddiness. They urged parents not to send their children to school on an empty stomach.
 
 A total of 1,840 bicycles were distributed across Trichy in five schools as part of the scheme on Saturday.
