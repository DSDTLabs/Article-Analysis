For those waiting with bated breath to know when Prithviraj’s directorial, which has   in the lead, will go on floors, we have an exclusive scoop!

 The film scriptwriter   tells us that the movie will start shooting in 2018. “The plan right now is to start shooting the movie by May 2018, that’s when Raju will be free and I will also be done with my projects,” he says.
 
 On the project though, the scriptwriter says, “While being a feast for Mohanlal fans, we also want   to be a quality film. His star status now is larger than the characters he plays. So it becomes difficult for the writers to come up with a suitable character that would appeal to the star as well as the actor in him. That’s what we are trying to accomplish with Lucifer. It’s like hosting an emperor in your home and you have to be prepared for that – creatively and emotionally.”
