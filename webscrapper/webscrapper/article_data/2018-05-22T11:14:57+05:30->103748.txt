CHANDIGARH:   and   Randeep Singh   said on Monday that   the came to power at the Centre and in Haryana based on “lies and deception” and it now wanted to retain power by “dividing” people.

 Speaking at the meeting of a caste council in Jind on Sunday night, Surjewala asked people to “remain vigilant against such efforts”. “Rise in fuel prices, imposition of the goods and services tax (GST), and unconstitutional actions of the government have damaged the global perception of India and shaken the confidence of people,” he said.
 
 He called the BJP “anti-farmer” and said its governments failed to fulfil their promise of increasing minimum support price for farm produce. Surjewala, who represents Kaithal in the Haryana assembly, appealed to the people to elect a   government in the state and at the Centre, and promised all-round development.
 
 He also attacked Haryana’s key opposition party, INLD. “Any leader who has tried to snatch farmer rights has to pay dearly. Former CM Om Prakash Chautala (of the INLD) is the prime example. Today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar are walking the same path, with utter disregard for India’s democratic and constitutional laws,” he said. “The days of the BJP government in the state are numbered. It has lost the people’s support and confidence.”
