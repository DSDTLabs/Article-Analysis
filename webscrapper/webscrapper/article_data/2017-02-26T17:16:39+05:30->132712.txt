Just because both films talk about the relationship between a dad and a son, it should not be compared."

 Its scribe   had already explained that though the films have a basic theme, there is nothing common about the two films. He also said that Vineeth and he are good friends and when they discussed about the common plot, the both had said that there is nothing common in the films.
