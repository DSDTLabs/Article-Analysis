MANGALURU: The news about a temple on the outskirts of the city introducing a  , widely shared across  , is a hoax.

 Posts about the   around 19km from here, introducing a dress code had gone viral on social media since Tuesday. Many devotees from Dakshina Kannada had even praised the move. However, the temple management clarified that no dress code has been introduced.
 
 “We believe   in Bengaluru introduced a dress code. We don’t have any dress code. We don’t know from where the rumours stemmed but we’ve been getting a lot of queries. Our well-wishers have brought a few such posts to our notice,” Prasad, chief executive officer of the Polali temple, told TOI.
 
 The pictures of flexes on social media read that men are allowed to wear only dhoti or formals while women are expected to wear saris with blouses or chudidars with dupatta appropriate to their age. The flexes also read, “Young girls may wear gowns covering up to feet. Women and girls should tie or bind their hair with clips or rubber bands.” While the pictures do not mention the location, the posts mention it’s Sri Rajarajeshwari Temple in Polali.
 
 A resident of  , who actively takes part in all temple activities, believed that the Mangaluru temple had introduced the dress code. Realising the truth after a day, he said local youth groups may have spread the false message to bring in “discipline”.
 
 “The local youths from Hindutva groups may have been pushing it on social media. I think their intention is not wrong. They want to maintain discipline on temple premises because some men wear shorts and women wear sleeveless clothes and jeans,” he said.
 
 Another devotee said the temple is being renovated (jeernodhara) and the authorities may mull over introducing dress code in future.
