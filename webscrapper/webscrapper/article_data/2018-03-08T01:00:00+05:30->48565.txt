It’s been four years since   and   exchanged rings, but there has been no news of their wedding since then. However, the wrestler-turned-actor has confirmed to BT that he plans to get married to his girlfriend of six years, this winter. Sangram says, “We had originally planned to tie the knot within a year of engagement, but we got busy with our work commitments and kept postponing the plan. Everything happens when it’s meant to and I feel that it’s about time now. I am planning a winter wedding and don’t want to delay starting a family.” 

 Four years is a long wait. Did Payal ever pressurise him to take the plunge? He replies, “We have been together since six years and understand the need of the hour. Payal and her family members are progressive and they knew that   could wait. However, my mother calls me every second day to enquire about my wedding plans. So, I don’t think there is any point delaying it anymore.”
 
 While Payal has always praised Sangram for making her emotionally stable and a better person, the latter too credits her for his transformation. He says, “She has improved my sartorial sense. Meri English bhi sudhar gayi hai, ab main Enlgish mein ladai bhi kar sakta hoon usse (laughs).”
 
 On the work front, besides wrestling and giving motivational speeches to students across the country, Sangram has added another feather in his cap. He has extended his support to a scholarship scheme, started in his name, in some schools in  . He says, “When the students were asked under whose name they wanted the scholarship, 85 per cent chose me. I am happy that differently abled and financially challenged athletes will be trained in sports under this scholarship. We will also focus on students who are academically strong. I relate to them because I too have faced a lot of hardships in life.”
