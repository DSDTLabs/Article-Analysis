BHUBANESHWAR: Agriculture minister   on Saturday refuted allegations that last month's farmer suicide in Bargarh district was a result of crop failure and debt, and instead put it down to marital discord. 

 Making a statement in the state assembly over the death of 55-year-old   of Kendapalli village, Maharathy said: "On February 26, he had repeated fights with his wife over the use of fertilizer in his land. He must have consumed pesticide due to differences with his wife and fallen ill, following which he was rushed to Bargarh district headquarters hospital. As his condition deteriorated he was shifted to VSS, Burla, where he died on February 27." 
 
 Maharathy was making his statement on the basis of a report submitted by Bargarh collector Anjan Kumar Manik.
 
 The   added that Khainu has three acres of land in his name while his wife has 1.74 acres. "He was growing paddy and vegetable. Irrigation was being provided to his land for the past five years through a deep bore-well. He had a normal crop," Maharathy stated.
 
 The minister, however, admitted the area suffers from power outages and said the energy department officials have been addressing the problem at regular intervals.
 
 On the debt issue, Maharathy said Khainu has a loan of only Rs 18,818 which he had taken from primary agriculture cooperative society, Gobindapur, in Bargarh district. The district administration has sanctioned an assistance of Rs 10,000 from the Red Cross fund for his family.
 
 Opposition Congress and the BJP rubbished the minister's claim and termed it as an insult to the farmer's family. 
 
 "Khainu ended his life due to loan burden which the state government is not ready to accept. It is an insult to his family,"   said.
 
 Congress legislator   said the state government has no sympathy towards the plight of farmers. 
 
 "The peasant community will give a befitting reply to the BJD government for making such ridiculous statements on farmer suicide," Majhi said.
