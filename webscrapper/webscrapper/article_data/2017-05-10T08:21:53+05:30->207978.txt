 Govindraj said that a group of people belonging to the community started beating up Sreejith when he tried to film the procession. “They manhandled us when we tried to stop them,” he said adding that the attack seemed to be a planned one aimed at the lawyer who had come forward to support them. 
 
 Mananthavady police have taken a case against six persons on the basis of the complaint by Sreejith. Meanwhile, police have also registered a case against Sreejith on the basis of a complaint from a temple committee office-bearer that he misbehaved with women. tnn
