KOLKATA: Litigants on Monday had to suffer on the first day of the five-day ‘cease-work’ protest called by three lawyers associations at Calcutta High Court demanding appointment to at least 40 of the 45 vacant posts of judges.

 The sanctioned strength of judges at   is 72. However, the retirement of three judges last week has brought down the present number to 27. The Trinamool Congress legal cell initially decided to stay away from the protest called by the Bar Association, Bar Library Club and Incorporated Law Society. But on Monday it participated in the protest actively.
 
 Uttam Majumdar, president of  , said, “The cease work was successful on the first day. The associations have demanded that central government nominate the acting chief justice as the permanent chief justice of Calcutta HC and that there should be at least one judge from West Bengal in the  .”
 
 State public prosecutor   said, “Bail and anticipatory bail petitions were not heard today. Litigants who came from distant places suffered.” Important hearings such as the state government DA case which was supposed to be heard today had to be postponed.
