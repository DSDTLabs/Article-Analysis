CHENNAI:   cannot seek monopoly on the red-black flag as its history dates back to 1944 when the combination was introduced by Periyar while launching Dravidar Kazhagam, T T V Dhinakaran said to the Madras high court on Tuesday. 

 Dhinakaran made the submissions through an affidavit while opposing a suit filed by chief minister and AIADMK joint coordinator   to restrain Dhinakaran from using a flag that bore resemblance to the AIADMK, for his newly launched party Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK).
 
 Referring to a judgment of the high court, Dhinakaran said the court had already held that no legal protection was available to any specimen flag of any registered or unregistered political party and therefore, AIADMK could not claim any monopoly on the colours red, black and white.
 
 This apart, he further contended that as claimed by AIADMK, intellectual property law cannot be used to protect a flag of a political party, as it extends only to businesses.
 
 Disputing the plea raised by AIADMK, Dhinakaran said that almost all the Dravidian party flags were similar to each other comprising the red and black colours. "The white bust of   cannot in anyway restrain me from using a flag with white bust of Jayalalithaa," he added.
 
 Denying the contention of AIADMK that the three colours - red, white and black - have no significance, Dhinakaran said, "The colours indeed have significance and relate to the ideals of Periyar and Anna. It is rather unfortunate that the applicants - O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami - are not even aware as to the reason behind the colours of AIADMK."
 
 As claimed by the applicants, the goodwill of the party was not created by the colours of the flag but by the efforts taken by MGR and Jayalalithaa, he added. Recording the submissions, Justice C V Karthikeyan posted the plea to April 11 for further hearing.
