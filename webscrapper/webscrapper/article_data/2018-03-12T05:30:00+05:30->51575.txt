Mysuru: Eager to become the first sanctuary in the state to bag the coveted Ramsar Convention tag – the tag would imply that the sanctuary is a wetland of international importance – officials at the   Bird Sanctuary started the   exercise, the first at the site, on Sunday.

 The international tag is expected to boost conservation efforts by bringing in more funds that will help preserve the ecological balance of the sanctuary. Deputy conservator of forests (wildlife) V Ydukondalu exuded confidence of the sanctuary being accorded the coveted tag. “It will help boost the prospects of the sanctuary. There are 26 Ramsar Convention recognised centres in India, but none in Karnataka. We are confidence of meeting the criteria required to attain the tag,” he said.
 
 Yedukondalu said that the personnel were closely tabulating the number of ‘resident’ and migratory birds at the sanctuary. “We are counting the number of birds of each species, and tabulating the number of crocodiles. We will also take information on the habitation, the trees that birds prefer to nest on, their behaviour and preference. We are using a variety of methods for the census – the total count method, nest counting method and photography count method,” he added.
 
 Mentioning one of the crtiertia for being designated a wetland of international importance, Yedukondalu said, “A wetland is considered internationally important if it regularly supports 1% specimens of a species. The total number of painted storks in the world is 17,000, of which around 1,000 are in Ranganathittu – that is close to 6% of the population, well above the required number. The number of crocodiles too constitutes more than 1% of the population. There are around 150 to 200 crocodiles here.”
 
 The population of water-dependent animal population too is much higher than the prescribed 1%, making it eligible for the tag. “The tag will put Ranganathittu on the world map. Funds will flow for conservation, and bird watchers and scientists from across the globe will visit the sanctuary that will, in turn, lead to a lot of research. The best practices of Ramsar Convention sites can be adopted at the sanctuary,” said the DCF.
 
 Yedukondalu said that the biodiversity survey too was on the anvil. “In a week’s time, we will conduct a survey of the fish species in the sanctuaries, in association with the fisheries department. The fish, and aquatic species will be mapped next,” he said.
 
 Taking stock of nature
