Panaji: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the Rs 35,000 crore mining scam in Goa has decided to examine officials of Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) and the directorate of mines and geology in illegal mining cases. Superintendent of police (SP), crime branch, Karthik Kashyap said they have established that there is connivance among traders and officials of IBM and the directorate and all of them will be examined.  Recently, the SIT has started cracking down on traders after it was revealed that they, in collusion with different lease holders, were carrying out illegal mining in the state. It was also inferred that the traders couldn't be indulging in illicit mining without the aid of influential politicians, and bureaucrats in the IBM and the directorate of mines.
