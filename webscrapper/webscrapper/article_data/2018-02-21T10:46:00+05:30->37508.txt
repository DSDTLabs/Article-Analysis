CHENNAI: Chief minister   has convened a three-day meet of district collectors and senior police officials starting March 5.

 Palaniswami will hold a joint conference on the opening day and subsequently hold separate meetings with district collectors and police officials. “The meeting will be held at the Namakkal Kavignar Malligai in the Secretariat,” an official release said.
 
 The last time the meeting took place was in 2013, which was chaired by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. Bureaucrats said the meeting was long awaited. “The meet will offer a good opportunity to take stock of the implementation of government programmes and address implementation glitches. Best practices in the districts are often adopted as government schemes,” said a senior bureaucrat. With the government gearing up for the budget session, the meet will help boost the morale of the bureaucrats, especially when there is widespread criticism about governance deficit, feel officials.
