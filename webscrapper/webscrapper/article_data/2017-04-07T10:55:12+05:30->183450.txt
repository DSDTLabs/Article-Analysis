Kollywood:   by Arunraja Kamaraj and Dhibuninam Thomas has a swag that makes it instantly likeable. The way it is been composed reminds you of Santhosh Narayanan’s repertoire, but that’s the only similarity. Arunraja and Dhibu both sing with vigour and add funkiness to the number. This is followed by a love song,  , by Pradeep Kumar, who sounds just right for this number. It starts with a guitar and voice and slowly springs up a flute portion, which sounds pleasing to the ears. The composer has worked well with the instrumental work, which has only added value to the voice. Aasai has a daunting feel. With Sharanya Gopinath’s powerful singing, the song simply thrives on voice and strings. Also credited as the ‘Greedy Song’, this one sounds more like a situational number. This is followed   by Arunraja Kamaraj, which is a delight to listen. Arunraja simply takes the entire song on his shoulders with a powerful rendition. Giving an element of suspense and kick with high-on-energy beats, the song takes a sudden, interesting twist with a nadaswaram interlude. For a track like this one, the nadaswaram portion is in sync with the tone of the song. The chorus portion needs a mention, too, as it supports the song well. The album ends with Usiredukkum Kootam by Kapil, a gangster lullaby composed in a rock style. The song has many layers, but it is the guitar portion that stands out. This song, too, has an effective chorus. Dhibuninan makes a promising debut and gives an album that resonates with the Kollywood music of today.
