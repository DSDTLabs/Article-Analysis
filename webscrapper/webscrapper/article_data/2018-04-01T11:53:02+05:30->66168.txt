PANAJI: In an effort to discourage ferry crew from using toilets aboard the vessels, the river navigation department (RND) will build bio-toilets at ferry ramps across the state at an estimated cost of Rs 2.5 lakh per unit. 

 Powdered bio-enzymes naturally occurring proteins that catalyse the chemical reaction rate to decompose human excreta are added into bio-toilet bowels once a month. The consequent breakdown of fecal matter into an odourless and pathogen-free gas and liquid, produces an effluent that gets stored in the in-built tank of the toilet. This non-polluting, nutrient-rich effluent can be then released in the environment.
 
 “We have received a circular from the   (GSPCB) directing that there should be no toilets on board ferries. But that shouldn’t mean that the crew will be left without toilets. Instead of building regular ones that are likely create a nuisance on the ramps, we have decided to have bio-toilets. There will be one bio-toilet on each of the 18 routes,” an RND official said.
 
 The department will be installing two bio-toilets on priority by April-end: one on the Old Goa-Divar route and the other on the   route. “We have also asked the public works department (PWD) to convert existing restrooms on the Ribandar-Chorao route into toilets,” the official said.
 
 The Panaji-Betim jetty is also likely to be manned by security guards from the new fiscal. “Four people have been trained to work in shifts. They are awaiting appointment letters,” a source said.
