 Kudchadkar, a Class IX student studying in Margao’s Fatima Convent High School, was oblivious to her social media fame, and, when contacted, said, “It is really unexpected. It is shocking actually. I am very happy.”
 
 The daughter of a minor businessman Abhay and homemaker Radha, Kudchadkar has won many prizes in intra-school and inter-school elocution competitions, but none like this one.
 
 “Her teachers chose her from the school to write the essay, as she regularly wins prizes at elocution competition. She wrote and submitted the essay and forgot about it. This was so unexpected. She was a state table-tennis champion at age 10 and has cleared the Goa talent search examination. But this is a pleasant surprise,” said her father.
 
 “It will take more than picking up the broom on only Gandhiji’s birthday was one of the things I thought of pointing out when I was asked to write the essay on ‘How can I make India clean’. I think that touched a chord,” said Kudchadkar.
 
 “If we keep 10m around our house clean, we can keep our village or city clean. We must not play blame games, instead, we must make cleanliness our religion... Only with widespread participation and commitment will the dream of Swachh Bharat be realised. Not just October 2, but everyday should be Gandhi Jayanti,” the girl said in her essay.
