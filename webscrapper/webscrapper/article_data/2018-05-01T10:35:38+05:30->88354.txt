MUMBAI: Singer   filed a written application at Santacruz police station late on Monday, stating that she received a threat allegedly from Madariya Sufi Foundation, asking her to remove a new music video from all communication mediums. 

 The application was filed after she tweeted to the police commissioner. The tweet read: Sir, @CPMumbaiPolice, the following videos are being called vulgar, hurting and insulting Islamic religious sentiments and made specifically for misguiding the youth (sic)." 
 
 She also posted her grievance on her Facebook account: "I have received a threatening notice from the Madariya Sufi Foundation to remove my music video from all communication mediums. They claim that the video is vulgar, it will flare communal tensions. Their letter has also called me a 'regular offender' and says that they have found another five-year-old video of me singing a Sufiana Kalam insulting to Islam because I'm 'dressed exposing my body' and playing westernised music."
 
 She added in the post, "The Madariya foundation along with the agreement of (a prominent dargah) have an issue with the description of my music video, 'earthy incarnations of the feminine Divine' and with 'a sleeveless dress and body exposing dancers'. This foundation claims to work for Sufism, peace and universal brotherhood. I ask you and India, what about the 'sisterhood'? Why is it that in this day and age, women are expected to cover up, not sing or dance in public. (sic)"
