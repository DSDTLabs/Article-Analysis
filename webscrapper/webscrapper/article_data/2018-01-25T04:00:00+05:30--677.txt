Rajkot: A 70-year-old open rain water drain passing through the old market area has turned into a major bottleneck not only for the traffic but also nearby business establishments. On Wednesday, nearly 2,000 traders of Rajkot’s old market demanded that the municipal corporation chalk out a plan to cover this 2km long and 30-feet wide drain in a way that can be used for commuting and eases the traffic in the narrow lanes. The traders alleged that the civic body, under the smart city mission, is focusing only on developing new areas and ignoring the old city. They also claimed that large number of people are shying away from the market due to approach problems and parking issues caused by the drain and instead prefer the malls and shopping centres elsewhere. The traders of Danapith, Sattabazar, Para Bazar and Mochi Bazar raised their grievances at a press conference.  Raju Pobaru, chairman of Rajkot Commodity Exchange, said, “We demand that the RMC cover this drain with a concrete slab. This will not only ease the traffic problem in our markets but also on the busiest crossroad on the Hospital Chowk.”  The traffic from IP Mission School can be diverted through this route and vehicles won’t need to pass through Hospital Chowk to come to the market. Most of the goods vehicles like chhakdas are badly choking the roads. Harshad Vithlani, vice chairman of RCX said, “If this drain is covered with slab, the road from IP Mission School near the court to Raiya Naka tower will be cleared. RMC can widen this road to 40 feet after removing encroachments and provide pay-and-park facilities to ease the parking problems.” Traders demanded that the RMC include this project in the upcoming budget. “Customers prefer to go on 150-feet Ring Road because it is impossible for even two-wheelers to approach our markets. Rajkot is included under the smart city mission and there is no dearth of funds,” said Pobaru.
