NEW DELHI: After dropping the   and 11 other wrestlers from the ongoing national wrestling camp for ‘indiscipline’, the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) has had a change of heart.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 After holding a disciplinary hearing into the matter on Wednesday and reviewing the written explanations submitted by the concerned wrestlers, the WFI has decided to allow three Phogat sisters – Geeta,   and   – to join the camp at the SAI centre in Lucknow. It means all three will be allowed to appear for the selection trials for the forthcoming  .
 
 
 
 
 
 However, the door has been slammed shut on the second of the Phogat sisters,  , the 53kg silver medallist at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. Babita, who had won a gold at the Glasgow CWG, has been kept under suspension by the WFI after she failed to offer any formal explanation for her no-show at the camp, which will run until June 25. The men’s freestyle and Greco-Roman camp is underway at the SAI centre in Sonepat.
 
 According to WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the federation’s decision will mean Babita will not be allowed to participate in the trials to select the women contingent for the Asiad, effectively dashing her hopes for representing the country in what would have been her second Asiad.
 
 In total, out of 15 men and women freestyle wrestlers who had originally been show-caused by WFI for skipping the camp, six have still been kept under suspension and their names permanently removed from the camp. These include Babita (53kg),   (62kg), Manju (62kg), Anju (65kg), Kamini (72kg) and men’s freestyle wrestler Shravan (61kg).
 
 Apart from Geeta, Ritu and Sangeeta, others who are in the camp include women wrestlers Indu Choudhary (50kg), Ravita (59kg), Nandini Salokhe (62kg), Reshma Mane (62kg), Manu Tomar (72kg), and male grappler Satyawart Kadian (97kg).
