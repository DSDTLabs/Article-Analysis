RANCHI: Just five days after the conclusion of the   (GIS), the city is back to its original form, with   dumped all over the place. 

 The work of garbage collection in the city has come to a standstill for the past two days as the cleanliness workers have gone on an indefinite strike from Tuesday; the reason being, the alleged non-payment of salaries to the workers for the past few months by Essel Infra, the company which has been outsourced the work of solid waste management by   ( ).
 
 The door-to-door garbage collection in most of the wards was crippled as a result of the strike. People waited at their doors with garbage bags in their hand but we're disappointed when the garbage collection vehicle did not turn up till afternoon
 
 “We thought for once that after GIS, the city would remain clean but it turned out that one can not trust the municipal corporation to maintain cleanliness in the long run,” said Sangeeta Jha, a homemaker.Prateek Singh, a businessman said, “Once again the garbage is strewn all across the footpath, not leaving us any space to walk. When will this menace come to an end?”
 
 RMC officials on the other hand claim that the work of garbage collection is still on. Deputy mayor Sanjiv Vijayavargiya said, “The employees of Essel Infra are on strike but we still have RMC employees to take care of the work. Garbage collection might not be as swift as before but we are trying our best to keep the city clean.”
 
 Preeti Priya, a housewife said, "Now I don't know what to do with the garbage. I can’t keep it inside the house neither can I leave it lying on the road."
