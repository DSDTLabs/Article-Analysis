Margao: The recent incidents of desecrating religious crosses, and temples was highlighted at the Sao Jose de Areal gram sabha on Sunday. The sarpanch, Perris D’Costa told TOI that, “the residents were requested to keep a watch out for miscreants. Also, villagers firmly oppose the road linking the Konkan railway to the western bypass, questioning the purpose of the proposed road passing from don khuris (two crosses) to the KRC railway over bridge”. Other issues raised were that of the frequent daily power interruptions, pollution, illegal development of plots and the illegal scrapyards. There were a total of 40 illegal scrapyards in the village, while some were demolished, others were voluntarily dismantled, D’Costa said “The villagers also want the panchayat to take action against illegal shops functioning without a NOC, as well as shops who have the NOC, but have not paid dues. The panchayat will soon commence a drive,” D’Costa said. He added that the villagers had also sought that the electricity department replace the old non-functioning street lights in the village. A resident Freddy Travasso said, “A resolution was passed that no permission be given for the development of plots unless it had been approved by the town and country planning department. Another resolution was passed demanding action against the illegal scrapyards, illegal land-filing and the closure of water-logged basalt stone quarries. The sabha also sought a map from government departments such as the PWD, WRD, KRC, forests and comunidade about land acquired by these departments for various proposals, so that a proper village development plan can be drafted for Sao Jose de Areal.”
