 has been one of the most interesting and out-of-the-box franchises on Indian television. As each season of the reality show keeps on getting tougher, the upcoming season is going to be one of the most challenging one for the contestants. 

 Stunt king   is back and will be hosting Khatron Ke Khiladi Season 8. Apart from that, Rohit will be putting his mind into stunt development as well. Golmaal and Dilwale director Rohit, who is known for making some of the biggest action/stunt sequences in Indian cinema, will work on getting the contestants do challenging stunts.
 
 Khatron Ke Khiladi Season 8 kicked off last night (May 9) with an event held in Mumbai. During the opening act of the event, Rohit slightly cut his hand and injured himself. He said that this is a trailer of what is going to happen to the contestants.
 
  
  
 One by one contestants got up on the Khatron Ke Khiladi Season 8 stage with various performances. Rohit then had a small chat with them where he tried to scare them by talking about their worst fears. 
 
 Then he addressed the media and said that it is time to call upon the main Khiladi of the show and with a lot of mist and music. 
 
 Shibani Dandekar and Monica Dogra, who will also be contesting, were not present at the event and will be joining the team directly in Spain.
