MUMBAI: England ODI and T20 captain   copped serious criticism for skipping the tour of Bangladesh in October last year citing security reasons. Although the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) respected his decision, the director of England cricket,  , had said: "Whilst we understand and respect Eoin and Alex's (Hales) decision, we are disappointed that they have made themselves unavailable for selection for the Bangladesh tour."

 "I don't regret that at all. It was a decision I'm very comfortable with," Morgan said here on Monday, ahead of England's warm-up game against India 'A' at the  . However, the 30-year-old did not look entirely comfortable, and added: "It was a decision I considered all consequences (to) when I did. Sitting here or sitting at home I would have been very comfortable with it."
