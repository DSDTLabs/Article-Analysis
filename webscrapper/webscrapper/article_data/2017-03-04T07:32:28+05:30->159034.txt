MUMBAI: Though the   penguin exhibit is one of Shiv Sena’s pet projects in the BMC, the party has raised a stink over delay in execution of the plan.

 On Friday, civic standing committee members, led by outgoing Sena standing committee chairman Yashodhar Phanse, visited the interpretation centre within Byculla   premises, which will soon be home to the seven penguins. However, they were surprised to find no   in it.
 
 An upset Phanse said they had scheduled their visit to the zoo on being informed by the civic administration that the birds would be moved into the new enclosure by Thursday. “It is difficult to understand that when the interpretation centre is ready, why are authorities delaying opening up the viewing facility to the public?” asked Phanse and added that they were shown the previous month’s air and water quality reports.
 
 Zoo director Dr Sanjay Tripathi said they are waiting for all the microbiological tests to be completed before shifting the birds. “We want to be assured that the water and air quality is perfect before the penguins are shifted. Once the penguins are brought in, we will need to acclimatize them to small groups of people after which we would be confident of opening up the facility to the public,” said Tripathi.
 
 Mumbai mayor, Sena’s Snehal Ambekar, had stated in a letter that the facility will be opened on March 6. However, zoo authorities said this seems to be difficult. Sources said Sena’s hurry in opening up the facility is due to the March 8 mayoral elections. However, Phanse denied it and said he was confident that a   mayor will be elected once again and therefore it would be their party that will inaugurate the facility.
