NEW DELHI: The equity markets continued to be volatile in Tuesday's early trade as   and   erased early gains.

 30-share BSE Sensex jumped more than 50 points to open on 33,913.55 while the broader 50-share NSE Nifty too gained 42 points to start trading on 10,477.55. However both the indices made a U-turn after the initial gains and by 10 am had plunged in the red.
 
 The choppy nature of investors' sentiments can be gauged from the fact that Sensex has witnessed a swing of more than 200 points within the first hour of trading.
 
 The Street has been circumspect since Monday over rumours about a government move to introduce long-term capital gains ( ) tax on stock investments, mainly to compensate for the loss in GST collections, spooked   investors in the last hour of trade on Monday. This led to a sharp dip in stock prices in the first session of 2018. As a result, the sensex — after remaining range-bound for most of the session due to low institutional participation during the New Year holidays — lost over 200 points within an hour and closed 244 points lower at 33,813 on Monday.
 
 In Tuesday's early trade, all sectoral sub-indices with the exception of Nifty IT were making losses. State Bank of India, Yes Bank, Eicher Motors and India Bulls were losing the most while ONGC,   and Infratel were gaining.
