PATNA: Former Union minister   and his son  , a former MLA, on Wednesday returned to the RJD fold after 16 months.

 The father-son duo, who had left the RJD in September 2015 after they were denied ticket in the last assembly polls, was re-admitted to the RJD in the presence of RJD president Lalu Prasad. 
 
 Raghunath Jha (77), considered one of the three CM candidates after the assembly polls in 1990 when Lalu eventually manoeuvred his way to lead the first Janata Dal government in Bihar, had joined the   (SP) after parting ways with the RJD.
 
 His son contested the last assembly polls as the SP candidate from Sheohar, but secured only around 15,900 votes and lost the election. Once regarded as the Brahmin face of RJD, Raghunath was the minister of health in Bihar and minister of state for heavy industries and public enterprise in the   government of UPA-1.
