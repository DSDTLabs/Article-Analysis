New Delhi: In a case of double jeopardy, the air traffic control ( ) has been blamed for using a wrong call sign to tell an aircraft what to do for avoiding a mid-air collision with another plane that had got dangerously close to it.

 This scary situation has been revealed by Aircraft Accident Investigation Board ( ) in its preliminary report on a near-miss close to Delhi between IndiGo flight 977 and KLM 811 that was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on November 2, 2016. The IndiGo Airbus A-320 had taken off from Delhi for Bengaluru.
 
 Around midnight, “a predicted conflict warning (PCW) was generated by the automation system between KLM 811 and IndiGo 977 when IndiGo 977 was passing (flying level) 328 (32,800 feet) with vertical speed of 1,300 feet per minute. Controller (ATC) ignored   for approximately 82 seconds,” the AAIB report submitted to the aviation ministry says. At this time, the “required standard lateral and vertical separation which should be 10 nautical miles (nm) or 18.5km and 1,000 feet, was reduced to 3.6 nm (6.6 km) and 200 feet, respectively” between the two planes that had hundreds of passengers on them.
 
 Now steps needed to be taken immediately to first stop heading in each other’s direction and then move away. And that is where the second — and bigger —scare unfolded. “The controller instructed IndiGo 977 to descend to flight level 340 (34,000 feet) but inadvertently used call sign as ‘Vistara 977’. (The wrong sign was used five times). IndiGo 977 continued to climb. Subsequently, the controller instructed KLM 811 to climb to (flight level) 360 (36,000 feet),” the report says.
 
 When the Indigo crew “realised that the descend clearance was intended for (them) instead of Vistara 977”, it descended to (flying level) 349 (34,000 feet)”, it adds. The safe and required vertical and lateral distance was re-established when the Dutch aircraft was at 35,300 feet and climbing, and the IndiGo aircraft was at 34,100 feet and descending.
 
 The report also talks about air traffic controllers being overworked. 
 
 Airports Authority of India, the parent body of ATC, and senior ATC officials didn’t respond to the queries.
