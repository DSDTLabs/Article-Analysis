But CPM panchayat member P K Suresh and other CPM workers resisted the move and assaulted them. The police officials, including an ASI from Devikulam police station, did not interfere or take any action to protect the sub collector and PLPF members.
 
  The district collector wanted action against the police officials for not taking action as per the direction of the sub collector. Sreeram Venkitaraman submitted a detailed report to the collector, recommending action against the police officials.
 
  However, Idukki district police chief had submitted a report to the IG, giving a clean chit to the police officials and pointing out that the revenue officials had not sought any police protection for the eviction drive.
