TRICHY: Makkal Needhi Maiam president   slammed the Centre for its failure to form the Cauvery Management Board (CMB) and put the blame equally on the state alleging that it did not push for the cause with due importance.

 He termed the government subservient to the Centre for its alleged inaction on the Cauvery issue, and called its one day hunger strike nothing but a farce. The stinging attack on the government came while Kamal was addressing a public meeting at G Corner grounds in Trichy on Wednesday.
 
 “While the responsibility of constituting the water management board is with the Centre, the state cannot hallucinate that it has fulfilled its duty by just filing a contempt petition after the deadline or holding a farcical one-day hunger strike,” he said.
 
 “The TN government is functioning like a subservient government to the Centre rather than upholding the State’s rights, which is the essence of India’s federalism,” Kamal told the reporters. He pulled up the central government for repeatedly ignoring the CMB demand and said the union government did not implement Supreme Court’s order in 2016 on the same issue.
 
 “It may be recalled that the Supreme Court in its order in September 2016 had directed the Centre to constitute the   as per the verdict of   within a four weeks from the date of the order. It was not constituted then citing legal technicalities. We are seeing a repeat of it now. I am reminded of the saying – ‘the more things change, the more they remain the same,” said Kamal.
 
 Stating that the primary focus of the public meeting would be on Cauvery issue, Kamal said, “We would bring to the notice of the public, the key issues surrounding this dispute as also the possible solutions that we all need to work on. We will be stating some of the key policy guidelines of our party on important areas. This would be a precursor to the overall policy document that we would publish in the next 5 months.”
