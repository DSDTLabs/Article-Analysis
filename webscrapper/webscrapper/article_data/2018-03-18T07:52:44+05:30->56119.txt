HYDERABAD: Although the number of vehicles continues to rise in the city, the highest growth of cars and bikes over the last two years has been reported in   and Rachakonda. As per data given by   authorities, nearly 50,000 cars and 1.2 lakh bikes were added to these roads between 2016 and 2017.

 Nearly 15,000 bikes and 7,000 cars have already been added in the first two months.The increasing number has a direct bearing on traffic flow. “Just about three years ago, the Ayyappa society road used to be a smooth ride but now the road is a choc-a-bloc at most hours in the day. The number of vehicles is rising everyday,” said  , a local from the area.
 
 Like the Ayyappa society road, roads like Izzatnagar, Nallangandla main road,   main road and Kokapet too have seen a significant jump in traffic, adding to the woes of locals. “The Nallakunta main road has now become atraffic nightmare. There is always a threat of colliding with an overspeeding vehicle if one comes onto the main road,” said  , a resident of the area.
 
 The reason for growth in these areas is due to the increasing buying potential of professionals, especially those who work in the IT sector. “People are not only preferring cars but they are going for bigger and costlier versions also. The automobile sector has been targeting their sales at the younger professionals for a while and it has generated results.  , we see many young professionals coming to exchange their mid-segment cars with high end ones, within two to three years of buying their first cars,” admitted a sales manager of a luxury car showroom at Gachibowli.
