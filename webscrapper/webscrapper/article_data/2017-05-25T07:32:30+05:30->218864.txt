RANCHI: Former MP and the founder of   Disom Party   on Wednesday said he would intensify the   (tribal empowerment campaign) to drum up   against the proposed amendments to the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act and the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act. 

 The campaign aims to garner support of more than 10 lakh tribal by June 15 with a Jharkhand Bachao Maharally planned in Ranchi on July 7. Murmu had recently held a similar rally in the state capital in which Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar was the chief guest. 
 
 Murmu said the volunteers have been asked to collect soil in metal mugs from the birthplaces of tribal freedom fighters, including that of Birsa Munda, and then get the members of the tribal community to touch the sacred soil and take an oath to oppose amendments to the tenancy acts. 
 
 "Everyone taking an oath would be asked to sign on a register, carried by the volunteers of the Adivasi Sengel Abhiyan, write their names and contact details and donate Rs 10 towards registration. Each volunteer group, carrying a mug filled with the sacred soil, has been assigned the task of mobilising the support of at least 1,000 volunteers would would spread and garner support of 10 lakh tribals by June 15," Murmu explained.
 
 There are 28 tribal MLAs in the state assembly which has an effective strength of 81 lawmakers. "Our volunteer groups will also approach each of the 28 tribal MLAs to enlist their support. These lawmakers will be asked to resign from their membership of the assembly and topple the BJP-led Raghubar Das government,'' Murmu added.
 
 The volunteers will launch mass campaigns through wall writings, bicycle rallies, distribution of pamphlets etc, handing over memorandums to block development officers and deputy commissioners voicing their opposition to amendments to the tenancy laws.
