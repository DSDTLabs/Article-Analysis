Ferozepur: Perturbed over the dilly-dallying attitude of the state government to convert the hideout of revolutionaries, including Shaheed Bhagat Singh, at Turi Bazar in Ferozepur City into a museum and open it to the public, relatives of freedom fighters have decided to join the agitation of Punjab Student Union and Naujawan Bharat Sabha (NBS) on March 23.

 Rajinder Singh, state president of Punjab Student Union, said a special state-level programme would be organized jointly by the PSU and NBS at Ferozepur on March 23 in which Bharti Bagchi from Patna, daughter of martyr B K Dutt; Kranti Kumar from Kanpur, relative of martyr Dr Gaya Prasad; Asim Rathor from Jaipur, kin of Mahaveer Singh; professor Jagmohan Singh, nephew of martyr Bhagat Singh; and Shantanu S Rajguru, kin of martyr Rajguru would participate.
 
 The double-storeyed house in Mohalla Shahganj, Turi Bazar in Ferozepur City, which was the hideout or office of martyr Bhagat Singh and other revolutionaries in 1928-29 has already been notified as a monument under the Punjab Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1964, but the said monument has not been opened for public.
 
 This is despite the fact that Krishna Satsang Trust, Ferozepur, has given consent for executing an agreement with the government for preservation, maintenance and opening the monument to public. At present, three shops are being run on the ground floor and a family is residing on rent on the first floor of the building. 
 
 Notably, the Punjab government has expressed its inability to covert the martyrs’ hide-out into a museum. Principal secretary, tourism and culture, Anjali Bhawra, in her affidavit, said, “There was no undertaking or direction to the government to convert the building in question as a museum.”
 
 In her response to an application filed by advocate H C Arora, who had filed a contempt petition seeking direction to the Punjab government to throw the martyrs’ hide-out open to public, the principal secretary, tourism and cultural affairs stated in an affidavit filed in the office of registrar of the high court that the area of 1,150 square feet which was used by martyr Bhagat Singh and other revolutionaries is in the hands of private parties.
