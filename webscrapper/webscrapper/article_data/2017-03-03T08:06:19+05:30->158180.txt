NAGPUR: “Among a hundred is born one valorous and among thousands is born an orator. Littérateur of eminence Ram   was one such person whose oratory still lingers in the minds of those who heard him in person,” said Avinash Senad, an educationist, on Thursday.

 Shewalkar was a person who had no foes. He abhorred to join the rat race of people going to any cheap levels to reach the top. He was a complete man, Senad said while speaking on ‘Uttam Vyaktimatva: Prof Ram Shewalkar’ at a programme organized by Maharashtra Gandhi Smarak Nidhi at Kasturba Bhavan, Bajaj Nagar to mark the birth anniversary of the legendary orator and writer. 
 
 Stating that Shewalkar never judged persons by their stature, Senad said that he was known to keep harmonious relations with those who came in his contact. Neither was he critical of anyone without reason. Such qualities are rare and worth emulating. Simplicity was one of his traits that he did not leave. Humour was an integral part of Shewalkar’s personality as he used to believe that smile brought people together from miles away, Senad said.
 
 Shewalkar had on him profound influence of Mahatma Gandhi and   and he followed their ideals, Senad added.
 
 Sunil Patil, secretary, Kasturba Gandhi Bhavan and Dr Prakash Towar, trustee, were present at the programme.
