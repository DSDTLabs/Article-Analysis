COIMBATORE: If the rains on Monday gave a respite for the farmers, they were offered further solace on Tuesday when the state government started distributing  .

 State municipal administration minister   commenced the relief distribution in Coimbatore by handing over drought assistance to the tune of Rs 12 lakh to 95 farmers at an event held here.
 
 The government had fixed Rs 13,500 per hectare as drought relief for paddy, Rs 18,000 for coconut and Rs 7,410 for pulses. Irrespective of the extent of land cultivated by the farmers, they are eligible for relief only for two hectares, according to the modalities worked out for drought assistance this time.
 
 Also, the assistance depended upon the extent of damage.
 
 Velumani said that in the first phase, 14,360 farmers would be given financial assistance worth Rs 15 crore by March 15. “Assistance for other farmers would subsequently distributed,’’ he said.
 
 In Coimbatore district, about 1.17 lakh farmers have suffered crop damages due to the drought. 
 
 Velumani said that a sum of Rs 171.8 crore has been allocated for distribution to farmers as drought relief through the agriculture department, while Rs 12.5 crore has been allocated under the horticulture department.
 
 Taking into consideration the worst drought that the district had suffered, efforts are on to conserve water in future by desilting and strengthening water bodies even as awareness on conserving water is also on, the minister said. “While drinking water shortage has been mitigated to a large extent, measures like supply of water through trucks and laying additional pipelines are being taken to ensure that those areas that are still facing shortage are salvaged,” he said.
 
 Velumani also handed over autorickshaws at subsidised rates to four beneficiaries of ‘Puthuvazhvu’ scheme during the event.
