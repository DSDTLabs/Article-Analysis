Vadodara: A senate member of M S University has demanded that the state government should include subjects of social work and human resource management (HRM) in the list of subjects of the Gujarat State Eligibility Test (GSET).

  The test is conducted for determining the eligibility for lectureship in universities and colleges of Gujarat.
 
 “GSET presently has a list of 24 subjects. But social work and HRM are not included in this list, thereby depriving thousands of masters students of job opportunities available to them,” said senate member Kapil Joshi, who submitted a memorandum to professor C N Murthy, member secretary, GSET. 
 
 MSU is the nodal agency for conducting GSET in the state. The test will be held on August 27.
 
 “The subjects should be included in the list so that students of the state can qualify or get opportunity to get selected on teaching or research positions in the state and for registration of PhD,” he said.TNN
