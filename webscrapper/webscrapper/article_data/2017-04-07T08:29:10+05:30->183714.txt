PUNE: The Pune police on Wednesday suspended six policemen of   police station for failing to register a complaint against the operators of a gambling den at Dudulgaon near Dighi after a raid in October 2016. 

 Those suspended were assistant inspector  , police naiks Somnath Borade, Namdeo Wadkar, Vipul Hole and   and constable Parmeshwar Sonale.
 
 Additional commissioner of police (administration)   issued the order after the policemen were indicted in a preliminary enquiry. A departmental enquiry has been ordered against the policemen. 
 
 Deshpande told TOI that the policemen were placed under suspension as their continuance in service can influence the departmental probe.
 
 The policemen had conducted a raid at a gambling den at Dudulgaon and seized cash of Rs 89,000 on October 8, 2016. The operators were brought at the police station, but instead of registering a case under the Gambling Act, the policemen took preventive action against them under Maharashtra Police Act and allowed them to go. 
 
 It is alleged that the policemen misappropriated the seized cash and demanded a bribe of Rs 25,000 from one of the operators for not registering a complaint under the Gambling Act. The operator filed a complaint against the policemen at the office of deputy commissioner of police (Zone IV), following which an inquiry was ordered against them.
 
 An inquiry conducted by assistant commissioner of police (  division) prima facie revealed the involvement of the policemen. A report indicting them was sent to senior police officials.
 
 On April 1, five cops including a sub-inspector of the Kothrud police station were dismissed for under-reporting the value of demonetised currency notes seized from a businessman on February 2. They had seized demonetised currency of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination, valued at Rs 66 lakh, in Kothrud, but showed only Rs 20 lakh on the record.
