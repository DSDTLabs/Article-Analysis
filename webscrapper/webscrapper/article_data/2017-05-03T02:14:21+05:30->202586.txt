NEW DELHI: BJP president   on Tuesday called his party’s thumping win in the municipal elections people’s approval for the Modi government’s policies and a step towards winning back the   assembly after the humiliating defeat of 2015. 

 Speaking at Vijay Parv, an event organised by BJP’s Delhi unit to celebrate its recent poll victory, Shah asked the newly elected   to work hard and make Delhi a ‘model capital’. 
 
 “People from various states live here.   is the country’s mandate. The recent verdict just shows that people of the country are with Narendra Modi,” said Shah addressing hundreds of party members. 
 
 Shah lauded the hard work of the booth-level workers, the previous councillors who accepted the party’s decision not to repeat them, and the state leadership for achieving a bigger mandate than in 2012. 
 
 However, he also warned the new councillors not to get carried away by the win. “People have voted for you not to bring changes in your life but to bring positive changes in their lives. Your responsibility is more than that of the councillors of Ahmedabad, Mumbai or Hyderabad, as this is the national capital. Now you will have to turn it into a model capital,” Shah said. 
 
 The mandate, Shah said, silenced the opposition that felt Modi’s “vijay rath” would stop in Delhi. Referring to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s allegations of EVM tampering, Shah said BJP’s victory has ended the “atmosphere of negativity and non-performance”. “The victory has put an end to the anarchist approach adopted by some people to find faults in everything despite their mandate to perform. If he (Kejriwal) wants to find the real reason for our success, he should meet my booth president,” Shah said at Kedar Nath Sawhney Hall, Civic Centre. 
 
 The attendees regularly broke into chants of ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’. But when Shah took the podium, the slogans changed to ‘Amit Shah ko jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Narendra Modi ko jai Shri Ram’. 
 
 Shah asked the attendees to look up to Modi who has been “working for 20 hours a day” since taking charge. He also took a dig at former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh without naming him while referring to BJP’s 2014 victory. “People did not have any big expectations. They just wanted a PM who could speak,” he said.
 
 Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari also thanked the former councillors for accepting the party’s decision to give tickets to fresh faces. He urged all 181 of the new ones to work towards a second victory by fulfilling the wishes of Delhiites.
 
 Tiwari’s own standing in the party has visibly improved since the victory. “Since he (Shah) reinvigorated the workers through panch parmeshwar sammelan at Ramlila Maidan, none of the party workers have rested at all. The enthusiasm that made thousands of workers toil in the scorching heat had already made it clear that BJP’s victory chariot will not halt in Delhi,” said Tiwari.
 
 The event was also attended by BJP’s organisational secretary Ram Lal, Delhi BJP in-charge Shyam Jaju, Union ministers Harsh Vardhan and Vijay Goel, MoS Jitender Singh and Nirmala Sitaraman, and veteran leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra.
