New Delhi: A day after Delhi BJP chief   expressed dissatisfaction over the newly-appointed state executive team, the party on Tuesday appointed two of his close   as district in-charges.

 Rajkumar Ballan and Anil Gupta have been made in-charges of Mayur Vihar and Shahdara districts, respectively. The party has re-appointed Praveen Shankar Kapoor as its media in-charge. Sources said Tiwari is likely to appoint more district in-charges in the days to come.
 
 During the Lok Sabha elections, Gupta was the president of Naveen Shahdara district and Ballan was state in-charge of  .
 
 Though he is new to the organisational setup, Tiwari’s aggressive campaign against AAP and his effort to revive the state unit in the last one month has impressed the BJP’s senior leadership.
 
 A section of the party’s members, however, are disappointed with the decision. Of the former 14 district presidents, only three—Ballan, Gupta and Satyender Singh—have been accommodated in the new team.
 
 “The party has sidelined the team that worked hard during the 2013 and 2015 assembly elections and Lok Sabha poll in 2014. Some inactive members have been included in the state executive. Is this the reward for working hard?” said a former district president. Some are planning to raise the matter with the senior leadership.
 
 The state unit is soon going to start work in the mandals as major changes need to be made post-delimitation. Of the 279 mandals, most need to be reconstituted as polling booths will change due to a shift in boundaries of municipal wards.
