AHMEDABAD: On the day of the weddings of his two granddaughters, Aziz-Musa Chipa (75), was shocked to find state reserve police ( ) personnel camping in the Ochchavlal Tlati marriage hall in Raipur, which he had booked in January.

 Chipa was told to leave and go elsewhere by the policemen, who refused to budge. Chipa was supposed to welcome 1,500 guests, including the bridegroom’s relatives at the venue just four hours later. Guests had come from Iqbalnagar and Pali in  . “It was such an embarrassment, I nearly had a heart attack. Where would I receive the guests? I was in trouble,” says Chipa. 
 
 Two days before the weddings on April 19, Chip requested the policemen to leave and also reminded municipal staff to make sure the hall was emptied so he set up the lunch on April 22. “I wanted to ask these officials if this had happened to their families at a wedding?” says Chipa. 
 
 “I had paid Rs 6,200 in advance and Rs 4,000 to confirm the booking. The   gave me a receipt but did not tell me that they had let the hall out to the SRP,” said Chipa.
 
 Chipa ended up serving his guests lunch on a footpath near his home, while a businessman helped him book a small hall nearby, at Tokarsha ni Pol near  .
 
 AMC assistant manager administration (central zone) Pranav Barot explained that in “communally-sensitive” areas, a request from the state DGP or police commissioner to allot municipal property for personnel cannot be turned down.
 
 “We plan to invite private operators to run all our marriage halls and then such problems will not arise. Private bodies can refuse the SRP or police,” said Barot. When asked if this would change the “communally sensitive” status of Raipur, the reason the hall was let out, Barot had no answer. Chipa was assured a refund but refused compensation for the trauma he underwent.
