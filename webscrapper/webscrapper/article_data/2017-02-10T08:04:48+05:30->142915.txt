BENGALURU: Melody flowed when six young girls from villages in   town, Uttara Kannada district, joined Marialena Fernandes, professor of chamber music,   in Vienna, and the group Trio Viennair at the Serendipity concert on Thursday. 

 The event was organized by the   (BSM) at the Guru Nanak Bhavan. "Marialena sent us a recording of the piece, and the girls practised it using traditional musical instruments," said Cheryl Rebello, chief strategy officer, CherYsh. The NGO has been working in remote villages of the district to educate and secure rural girls and women through after-school centres, scholarship support for higher education and local opportunities for livelihood. 
 
 CherYsh operates in 16 villages of Haliyal taluk with 1,000 children part of the 25 after-school learning centres. A local woman is trained to be the learning facilitator to make the experience a happy one for the children.
 
  "Music is something that comes naturally to the students; we've even begun to teach them English and mathematics through music," said Cheryl. "Serendipity is the coming together of a vision to connect talent in music, regardless of any physical or economic boundaries," she added. 
 
  For the Serendipity concert last year, the children from Haliyal learnt an Austrian song in under three weeks, and during the workshop they learnt a Polish song within 10 minutes.
