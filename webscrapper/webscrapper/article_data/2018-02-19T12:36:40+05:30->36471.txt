NEW DELHI: Economic fraud is the second biggest reason for extradition to India. As authorities search for diamantaire   in connection with the   scam, here's how India has used extradition treaties to chase down fugitives.

 
 
 
 
 The Extradition Act, 1962, regulates the surrender of a person to another country, or request for arrest of a person in a foreign land. A request for extradition can be made whenever a person's conduct in India or in a foreign state corresponds to any in the list of extraditable offences and is punishable with a minimum of one year jail term. It is the Centre that must initiate the process. India has 
  and extradition arrangements with 9.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 There's consensus on a few conditions. The crime should fulfil criterion of dual criminality â€” punishable in both the countries. For instance, homosexuality may be a crime in country A while it is accepted in B. In that case, A cannot request B to extradite a person charged with a homosexuality-related offence.
 
 Political criminals are generally not extradited. Some countries refuse to extradite if the expected punishment is not in practice in their own territories. For instance, Australia, Canada, Macao, Mexico, and most European nations refuse to extradite an accused if the person in question may be given capital punishment after surrender. Similarly, France, Germany, Russia, Austria, China, Taiwan and Japan refuse to extradite their own citizens.
 
 
 
 Between 2002 and December 7, 2016, (latest data available), 62 fugitives have been extradited by foreign governments to India, the majority were Indian citizens.
