MARGAO: Irked at being denied the   nomination from  , former Congress urban development minister   on Thursday quit Congress and vowed to ensure the defeat of the   (GPCC) president Luizinho Faleiro in the   elections.

 Addressing the media surrounded by hundreds of his supporters in Cuncolim, a defeated-looking Joaquim lashed out at the GPCC president Faleiro, who is contesting from the neighbouring Navelim constituency accusing Faleiro of denying him the party nomination and selling the party ticket. 
 
 The former two-time Cuncolim legislator remarked, “There were three aspirants for the Cuncolim Congress nomination – Clafacio Dias, John Monteiro and myself. I would have been happy if the Cuncolim party ticket had been given to John as he had polled 5,000 votes in the last elections. There is no enmity between me and John.”
 
 Stating that he would file his nomination on either January 16 or 17, Alemao said that he will consult his workers about his future course of action and decide whether to contest as an independent or from another party, as he claimed to have received many offers.
