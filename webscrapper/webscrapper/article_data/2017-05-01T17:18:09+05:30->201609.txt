This news might come as a disappointment to all   fans. Contrary to popular reports, the actress will not be seen making a guest appearance in hubby Saif Ali Khan’s upcoming film ‘Chef’. The film’s director  , who has earlier helmed the acclaimed ‘Airlift’, squashed the rumours of Bebo being seen in the comedy drama. 

 ‘Chef’ has Saif in the lead role and is a remake of the 2014 Hollwood comedy with the same name starring Jon Favreau,  , Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr.
