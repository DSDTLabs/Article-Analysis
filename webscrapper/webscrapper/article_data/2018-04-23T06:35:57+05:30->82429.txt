BEGALURU: It was during their trip to Manali that
  Peter Franzeline and Anna Posh found a  ,   and Indie. Soon, the dog became their companion during the rest of their backpacking trip across India. A few days into their expedition, six-month-old Malana was accustomed to long bike rides as well. However, during their stay in Madiwala, Bengaluru, Malana accidentally jumped on to a bike which sped away with her quickly before the couple could react.

 Devastated on losing their newly found friend, they contacted various organisations, including the Cubbon Park Canines (CPC),  , to trace Malana. The CPC put up posters with the photograph of the missing dog across the city and in four days, Malana was reunited with the couple.
 
 On Sunday, the overjoyed couple was at Cubbon Park to get their pet tagged to ensure it gets tracked easily if it gets lost again. The pet licence drive was organised by CPC. 
 
 CPC members say tagging of dogs is slowly catching up among pet owners in Bengaluru. The tags are available in plastic and metal with details of the owner. 
 
 Priya Chetty-Rajagopal, founder of the CPC, said: “Several dogs go missing in the city and can’t be reconciled only because they do not have a pet tag. Spare two minutes, get your dog tagged and save time and pain.”
 
 CPC members said they receive at least three to four complaints of missing dogs every week. “Dog tags can help resolve this issue. We are running a social media campaign called ‘dog tags not dogs lost’ which includes issuing of free plastic tags,” said a member. 
 
 CPC has been holding special pet licence drives jointly with BBMP at Cubbon Park on select Sundays. They have distributed over 3,500 plastic tags in the past eight months. 
 
 “Owners have also bought 100-150 permanent embossed metal tags. On Sunday alone, 70 dogs were tagged,” a member added.
