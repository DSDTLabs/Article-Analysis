VADODARA: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national spokesperson Ashutosh on Tuesday hit out at   and police for arresting AAP women wing leader   ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two-day visit to the state.

 He alleged that Patel was arrested by the police without giving her any reason in the wee hours of Tuesday in violation of Supreme Court guidelines.
 
 “She was arrested at 4.15am from her house. As per the Supreme Court guidelines, police cannot enter home, detain or arrest any woman between 6pm and 6am,” he said while talking to media persons in Anand, claiming that when he inquired with Gujarat police, he was told that the orders to arrest Patel had come from the “top”. 
 
 “We (AAP) are considering to appeal to the court against the illegal arrest of AAP volunteers in Gujarat,” he said, questioning the arrest of party’s volunteers in the state. 
 
 He also claimed that BJP-ruled state government and the “gang” of BJP president Amit Shah were scared of AAP in Gujarat. “Why did the police arrest only AAP volunteers. It did not touch any Congress worker,” he said. 
 
 Ashutosh who along with AAP team from Delhi was in Anand for carrying out a review of Anand Lok Sabha seat, said the party will contest in all the `182 seats in the forthcoming assembly elections in Gujarat. 
 
 “Eighty per cent of the organization’s work has been completed in Gujarat and the rest will be completed soon,” he said. 
 
 Coining a new slogan ‘Beti bachao, BJP bhagao’, he hit out at the BJP alleging that names of many BJP workers cropped up in heinous crimes against women like Naliya gang rape in the recent times.
