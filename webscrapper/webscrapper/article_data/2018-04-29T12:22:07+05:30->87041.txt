 GUWAHATI: All mosquitoes of a definite species cannot act as vectors in transmitting diseases to humans. Only those that have undergone some form of biological changes in their bodies to be carrying a particular virus can actually transmit it to humans, said health experts in a discussion titled 'Vector-borne Diseases and  ' in the city on Saturday. The discussion was organized by the Sanskriti Anveshak Forum. 
 
 Speaking on the issue,  , assistant director of state health services, said, "Only a   that has undergone some form of biological change in its body or has mutated can transmit a virus that it carries to a human. For instance, the culex mosquito species transmits the Japanese Encephalitis virus to humans, but not all culex mosquitoes can transmit the virus. Only those that have undergone some biological change can transmit it to humans through its bite."
 
 "In the present day, a number of different forms of vector-borne diseases have emerged that were unheard of in the past. Earlier, the viruses causing most of the vector-borne diseases were mostly confined to animals, but with humans harming the environment with modern activities and breaking the ecosystem, these viruses have now come in contact with humans, resulting in the incidence of a number of such diseases," said Nath.
 
 Experts also said a person may test positive for a vector-borne diseases without exhibiting any physical symptoms.
