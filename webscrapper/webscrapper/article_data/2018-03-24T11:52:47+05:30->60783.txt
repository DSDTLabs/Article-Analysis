PATNA:   and Vishvajeet Kumar, students of the department of applied economics and commerce at   (PU), have won the second prize in ‘Curious-2018’ — a national level online case study competition organized by Indira Institute of Management-Pune for postgraduate management students.

 The two students, who worked under their teacher Dharmendra Kumar Singh on a case report on ‘Redivivus Technologies Private Limited’, will receive Rs 21,000, a certificate and a trophy.
 
 PU vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh congratulated the two students and their mentor for leaving behind institutions like IIM-Ahmedabad and IIM-Bengaluru in the competition.
 
 PU goes digital: PU on Friday became the first university of the state to enter into an agreement with the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) for storing academic records of students in digital form.
 
 With its headquarters in Mumbai, the NSDL is a financial organization that holds securities such as bonds and shares in depository accounts that are similar to bank accounts.
 
 “This agreement will help PU in joining the National Academic Depository (NAD) — a 24X7 online system set up by the Ministry of Human Resource Development and the University Grants Commission by appointing NSDL Database Management Limited to facilitate academic institutions to digitally, securely and quickly issue academic awards to students. There is no need to carry original certificates, submit attested photocopies or wait for verification of documents,” PU students’ welfare dean   said.
 
 Once NAD becomes operational, students can have access to their certificates which will be linked with their Aadhar or NAD ID.
