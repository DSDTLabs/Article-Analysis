MUMBAI: The   was near perfect and the warmth unmistakable. Canadian PM   and his wife   met with industry heads, students, NGOs and film personalities on a stopover in Mumbai Tuesday.

 Trudeau said corporate India has committed US$ 1 billion investments in his country, which will create over 5,000 jobs. “We also spoke about Canadian companies investing in India,” he said. The 46-year-old PM, on a week-long tour of India, met with the CM and held meetings with corporate leaders including N Chandrasekaran, Kumarmangalam Birla, Anand Mahindra, Salil Parekh of Infosys and Cyrus Mistry of the Pallonji Mistry group.
 
 After a roundtable with women entrepreneurs including Swati Piramal of the Piramal group and  , managing director of ICICI Bank, Trudeau took partin the Canada India Business Forum.
 
 He stressed the need for people-to-people contact to drive investment and cultural exchanges. He said both India and Canada need to bring more women into the workforce. “India has only 26% women in the business workforce and this number needs to increase. Empowering women is not just a nice thing to do, it is the smart thing to do,” he said. He drew laughter as he said India and Canada were two of the world’s largest democracies, one by population the other by surface area.
 
 India sends 1.25 lakh students to Canada each year, making it the second largest population of foreign students in that country. Trudeau expected it would soon graduate to first place. As a corollary, he shone the spotlight on the subject of immigrants in Canada’s workforce. “At a time when the world is closing against immigration, we are opening up for more immigrants. One complaint I often receive from the business community is that we are not getting enough immigrants. I know that once we invite people in, they will hire more Canadians,” Trudeau said. His wife Sophie earned her own fan following as she ably fielded questions from students of   at Pedder Road.
