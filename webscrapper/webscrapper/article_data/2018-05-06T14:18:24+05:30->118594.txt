DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand CM Harish   came out fully in support of his UP counterpart   —currently engaged in a bitter feud with his father   and uncle   — by claiming that “my sympathies are completely with the work-oriented young leader who would be good for the future of UP.”

 Rawat told TOI on Saturday that he had faith in the young Yadav leader — “an energetic CM who has learnt alot.”
 
 The 69-year-old CM added, “In the present situation, if I had to vote, I will vote for Akhilesh. He is doing good work in the state and can do even better if there is an alliance between him and the  . The country will benefit from this alliance because if there is political stability in Uttar Pradesh, it will help the entire country.”
 
 Taking a dig at PM Narendra Modi, Rawat said, “The prime minister should pray to Baba Somnath that   continues to manage the Himalayan fortress of Uttarakhand — which has international borders — and UP — the biggest state of the country remains in the hands of Akhilesh, who is doing a good job.
 
 It is in the Centre’s interest that these two important states remain stable. The PM can then peacefully focus on his job at the Centre.”
 
 Rawat, who is battling anti-incumbency as well as a   enquiry into the CD sting case said that he would be going to the people “purely on the basis of development work done by me.”
