DUMRAON/PATNA:   CM   on Friday ordered an investigation into an incident of stone-pelting on his convoy in   district.

 The chief minister was on his way to Yadav-dominated   to launch development schemes when a group of people standing near a heap of bricks outside a bamboo plantation pelted stones on his convoy.
 
 Referring to the incident in his speech at a public meeting at Nandan, an angry Nitish hinted it was plotted by certain vested interests.
 
 “Some people are pursuing the politics of provocation and instigation against me, as my government’s initiatives aimed at the state’s development were harming their selfish interests,” he said. 
 
 Nitish also said that he did not bother about such people.
 
 Kumar inaugurated and laid the stones of schemes worth Rs 168 crores at Nandan panchayat in Buxar district and another 63 schemes worth Rs 228 crore at Ahinaura village in Kamur district on Friday.
 
 The chief minister was at Nandan and Ahinaura as part of his state-wide Vikas Sameeksha Yatra. 
 
 “I am not the one who runs the government sitting in the state capital... I prefer to personally assess the ground realities and ensure that the basic amenities like roads, clean water and power reach every village and locality,” Nitish said.
