VISAKHAPATNAM: Extraordinary qualities may sometimes mean trouble. This is what 25-year-old Yejjada Shanmukha Rao, who claims to be the  , says. Shanmukha Rao, who is 7 feet tall now, says he grew from just 4 feet to this height in the last seven years and is still growing. He believes this sudden spurt in length was a result of medicines that he took to check imbalances in blood circulation in 2010. He grew from 6.6 feet in 2016 to 7 this year. 

 A school dropout, Rao hails from   village of   mandal of   district. Thala Thampara is 18 kms away from Rajam.
 
 In an interview with TOI, Rao said he consulted doctor Dr PLN Raju in 2010 and took the medicines that the doctor prescribed along with some tabs prescribed by local medical practitioners. “Till Class IX, I was just 4 feet in height. After taking medicines, I found some unusual developments in my body. I am 7 feet now, but my weight is just 75 kgs. I face knee pains frequently and difficulties in sitting,” Shanmukha Rao said.
 
 Rao’s father Suryanarayana, who is a mason by profession, said more than health issues, his son was mentally pressurised by his height. 
 
 “Some people compare his height with mine and joke about it. They make fun of him. This apart, we are finding it difficult to maintain my son. I request the government to consider his condition and provide him with some job,” Suryanarayana said.
 
 When asked, Shanmukha Rao said he was interested in becoming a cop, particularly traffic cop as it suits him best. He could stand for long hours in such a profession. 
 
 He said he met the local police, who assured them that they would bring the issue to the notice of higher-ups for a posting. “The police assured me a job, but none of them approached me till date,” Shanmukha Rao said. 
 
 When contacted, Srikakulam district superintendent of police J Brahma Reddy said, “We verified his candidature. He failed class 10 examinations. We are not in a position to give him a job.”
