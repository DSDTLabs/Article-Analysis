Pune: City-based public sector lender   on Friday reported narrowing of its   losses, helped by progress in recoveries in the quarter ended March 31, 2018.

 The bank posted a net loss of Rs 114 crore in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, against a net loss of Rs 455 crore in the year ago period. In the full financial year, the bank’s net loss narrowed to Rs 1,146 crore against Rs 1,373 crore, a year ago.
 
 Its recovery more than doubled to Rs 1,765 crore in FY2017-18. The bank said its recovery from written-off accounts also increased over 3.5 times to Rs 138 crore.
 
 “We have good results in three key parameters — capital adequacy is above the benchmark, the net NPA has been contained below 12% and fresh slippages have reduced,” said RP Marathe, managing director and CEO, Bank of Maharashtra.
 
 Though, it has shown improvement on some parameters, it will take some time for the bank to claw its way back out the prompt corrective action (PCA) that the RBI placed it under. The lender still holds about 19.5% of gross NPAs on its balance sheets, but the management said it has put in place mechanisms that will accelerate recoveries and do well in parameters that are critical for it to come out of PCA.
 
 Marathe said the next step will be to get the net NPAs first to below 9% and then to 6%, before it is brought out of the PCA regime. Under the regime, there are certain restrictions on the category of clients that the bank can do business with.
 
 The bank’s gross NPA stood at Rs 18,433 crore – almost a fifth of its total advances of Rs 94,645 crore.
 
 Data also shows that bank has regained some of its lost ground by shrinking its balance sheet. In the financial year 2017-18, the bank’s advances fell about 7% and deposit growth remained flat.
