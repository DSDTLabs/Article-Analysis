LUCKNOW : An elderly man who lost his 28-year-old son under mysterious conditions five years ago has approached DGP headquarters with a plea for re-investigation into the case. 

 A native of Allahabad, Onkar Nath   lost his son Ram Krishna on July 13, 2013. The MBA graduate worked for a private company and during a tour in the city, was staying in a hotel on   in  .
 
 On the night of his stay, his condition deteriorated all of a sudden and he died. However, instead of informing the police or rushing the youth to a hospital, the hotel staff took his body to Allahabad on the basis of the address mentioned in Ram Krishna's ID.
 
 His father has now sought a narco test of the hotel staff members.
 
 Nigam said he had written to the police to get the matter investigated but no action came. "I have made at least 50 rounds to meet police officials in Allahabad and Lucknow but everybody tells me that they cannot do anything as the body was cremated without a postmortem. Having lost my son, I was in shock and could not inform police immediately," said Nigam.
 
 After meeting a senior officer who handles public grievances at DGP headquarters, Nigam insisted that narco test of staff members present in the hotel that night might help his case. 
 
 SSP   said, "I will check whether the hotel staff informed Hussainganj police or not. Only then would we be able to comment."
