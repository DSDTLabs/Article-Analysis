When actor   picks a script, you know that it won’t be a run-of-the-mill story. The National Award-winning actor likes to experiment, and today’s release,   — produced under the   banner — gave him an opportunity to do just that. He tells us that if he hadn’t worked on this film, he would have missed out on an opportunity to be part of a unique project. “It has been a wonderful journey. The film is an experiment, but it has commercial elements as well. I am not referring to fight-and-dance sequences. The film has good songs, a good message and is visually vibrant. The cinematography is the highlight of the film, which is a new, tender love story,” says Vijay.

 Playing a visually-challenged tour guide wasn’t an easy task for Vijay, because he had to essay someone who shows people things that he can’t see himself. So, to prepare for the role, director   suggested that they spend time with inmates of Belaku — a hostel for the visually challenged in  . “I was shocked with what I saw there. These men play goli, chess and cricket; they cook and iron clothes. I wondered how all of that was possible. They lead very dignified and active lives. Sukesh asked me to observe them, and that is how I prepared for the role. For 1.5-2 months, I noticed their body language and every small move. This is one of those rare films that gives an intimate look into the lives of the visually impaired — and it’s not the clichéd stuff that people are used to seeing onscreen. Sukesh is a mime artiste, so his focus is more on body language than on the spoken word. He would catch even the smallest mistakes I made and ask me to correct it. The result of this attitude is a wonderful film,” adds Vijay.
