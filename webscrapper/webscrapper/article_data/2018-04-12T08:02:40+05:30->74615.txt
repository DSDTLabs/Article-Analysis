AMRITSAR: The Punjab police has formed a three-member special investigation team (SIT) to probe allegations of “sexual harassment” against the   (GNDU) vice-chancellor, police said on Wednesday.

 Though the V-C could not be contacted despite several attempts, university officials said the allegations levelled by a woman professor were false and were made after she was removed from her post following complaints from students.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (DCP)   will lead the SIT that was formed recently after the complainant wrote to Punjab governor V P   and chief minister   with her allegations about twoweeks ago, he said. In her complaint, the professor has alleged that she was being harassed by the V-C.
 
 “The reason behind this harassment and exploitation is my refusal to satisfy sexual favours asked by him before he joined the office of V-C when he was professor Dean and Director in the Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar,” she further alleged in her complaint lodged with police.
 
 Meanwhile, GNDU PRO Parveen Puri said the students were not happy with the woman professor’s “arrogant” behaviour and she was creating “disturbances” in the department.
 
 A committee was formed by the V-C to examine all the issues raised by the students and then she was removed from her post, the PRO said. Thereafter, she made accusations of sexual harassment against the V-C, he said, adding the accusations made by the complainant were false.
