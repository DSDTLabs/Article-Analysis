Meanwhile, the settlement process which was initiated was rejected by the court as the case registered against them under section 506 of Indian Penal Code does not have a provision of settlement.
 
 During their student days, all four of them had allegedly threatened Milind Ekbote, a temporary lecturer of MSU’s technology and engineering faculty who is now an assistant professor. Ekbote had registered an FIR at Navapura police station on December 9, 2002 and three days later the police had even arrested the four BJP leaders.
