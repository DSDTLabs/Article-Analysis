Following in the footsteps of  , the state has initiated action against illegal slaughterhouses operational in the jurisdiction of several municipal corporations.

 The   (MPCB) on Saturday said it issued closure notices to more than 100   in the state for not obtaining the necessary permissions. “There were violations in various municipal corporations, and after being slapped with notices a few took permission,“ said an   official.
 
 According to a recent government report, of the 37 slaughterhouses in 16 municipal corporations and 21 nagar parishads in Maharashtra, 20 are illegal, and only eight have sought permissions from the MPCB.
 
 “We have issued over 100 notices. We are now re-checking eve rything to ensure they have the requisite permissions,“ the official added.
 
 As per the report, in order to run a slaughterhouse, permissions are mandatory for prevention and control of pollution under the Water Act 1974, and Air Act 1981. It is also compulsory to have infrastructure in place to dispose of animal waste.
 
 The MPCB had revoked the licences of four municipal corporations between March 2010 and October 2014. Three of those four had not reapplied for a licence.The remainder too had not sought to renew their licences, rendering them illegal.
 
 With no permissions, says the MPCB, it is a given that the waste generated by the slaughterhouses is being disposed in gutters which ends in water bodies.
 
 The situation is similar in the state's municipal councils. Of the 36 municipal councils, 21have slaughterhouses. And of these 21, six are legal, eight have applied for permissions and the other seven are illegal.
 
 Only those slaughterhouses and meat-processing units which have submitted concrete proposals with adequate treatment and disposal facilities for their liquid and solid waste will be allowed to restart their operations, according to MPCB officials. These permissions will be subject to strict and timely compliance with regulations.
