KOCHI: State government is shifting liquor outlets to residential areas without heeding public opposition to overcome the  's order to remove the outlets situated near national and state highways, a Congress   has alleged before high court. 

 The allegation was raised in a petition filed by   Anil Akkara. He is seeking a court directive to   (Bevco) not to shift liquor outlets without obtaining prior permission and licence from local self-government institutions by alleging that Section 232 of Kerala Panchayat Raj Act mandates so. Bevco has no privilege to shift its liquor outlets in violation of statutory provisions as the Supreme Court has already held that sale of liquor is not a fundamental right, the petitioner said. The state-owned corporation is duty bound to ensure that statutory provisions are complied with while opening liquor outlets and that they do not cause any nuisance to nearby residents, he alleged.
