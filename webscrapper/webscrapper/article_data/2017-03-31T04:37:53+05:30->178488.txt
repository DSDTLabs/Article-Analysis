Mumbai: Senior JD (U) leader and Bihar chief minister   has launched his party’s unit in   and appointed Lok Bharti legislator Kapil Patil as the   chief.

 Following an application submitted by Patil, legislative council chairman Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar on Thursday announced the merger of Lok Bharti with JD (U).
 
 “JD (U) has a huge presence in Jharkhand, Kerala and Karnataka. Now, Nitish Kumar will formally launch the party in Maharashtra on April 22. I am sure prominent leaders of progressive organizations and labour leaders will join hands with Kumar for creating an alternative to the existing political system,” Patil told TOI. Patil was first elected to the legislative council from the teachers’ constituency in 2006 and subsequently re-elected in 2012 by a huge margin. According to a Bihar-based JD (U) leader, in the months to come, Kumar is all set to expand his party at the national level.
