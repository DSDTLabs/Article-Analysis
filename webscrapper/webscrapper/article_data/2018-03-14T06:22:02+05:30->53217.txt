KOLKATA: The East-West Metro will connect with the first underground station   in early 2019 and Sealdah in 2020 before running the full course by 2021. The day after   Babul Supriyo announced the probable date for the inauguration of the first phase of the service from Sector V to   on October 2 this year, the managing director of the   (KMRC) Parashuram Singh said that KMRC would open first phase of the alignment by stages before making the entire alignment operational in 2021.

 
  
 
 Speaking to TOI on the sideline of the Assocham seminar, Mass Rapid Transport System For Urban Areas: Opportunities And Challenges, he said, “We are receiving two complete rakes from BEML most probably next month. The rest of the rakes will come well ahead of the inauguration of the first phase.”
 
 According to the original plan, the stretch from Sector V to Sealdah was to be inaugurated in the first phase but the change of alignment hit the entire plan. “Sealdah station can’t be ready till the tunnel boring machine (TBM), which starts construction from Esplanade to Sealdah in May, is retrieved at Sealdah station shaft,” said KMRC spokesperson A K Nandy.
 
 Once the station is ready, there is no problem in running the service till Sealdah. The Phoolbagan, the first underground station in the first phase, is nearing completion, while the finishing touches are being given to the elevated stations. E-W Metro significantly suffered a time overrun of five years and costoverrun of almost double (Rs 8,996.96 crore) the cost (Rs 4,875 crore) pegged at the time of initiation.
 
 “It’s a very challenging project. The air-conditioning of the entire tunnel itself takes more than 14 months. Each station takes three years to complete. We will not compromise on work to meet the target date. The date has been fixed to keep the work in progress and hopefully the target will be achieved,” a source added.
