RANCHI: The   (JAC) is set to cancel on Tuesday the   of   on grounds of  .

 Last week, the school education and literacy department had recommended the cancellation of the affiliation of these institutions following complaints of poor results. 
 
 The council, taking the recommendation into consideration, will cancel the affiliation of these colleges on Tuesday after conducting a meeting with the affiliation committee.
 
 “The intermediate results last year were very poor. So, we decided to look into the matter and, based on what we found, take action against teachers and colleges. We then saw that the results were below par mostly in intermediate colleges and not in plus two schools,” department secretary   said.
 
 Following this, the department decided to form committees at the district level to inquire about these intermediate colleges.
 
 “After the results were published in 2016, I instructed the deputy commissioners to form committees at the district level to look into the matter. The reports then revealed that many such colleges were running only on paper,” Patnaik said.
 
 These colleges enrol students for the sole purpose of getting them registered for the intermediate examination. “There are no classes. As students do not attend any classes, most of them end up failing the exam,” she said.
 
 As intermediate colleges get their affiliation through the JAC, the department directed the council to cancel the affiliation of all such colleges.
 
 JAC chairperson Arvind Pratap Singh concurred and said, “We will cancel the affiliation of 43 colleges in the first phase. In the second phase, the affiliation of two dozen other colleges will be cancelled.”
 
 Of the 43 colleges that have been identified, 13 are from Ranchi, 12 from Hazaribag, seven from Jamshedpur, three from Dhanbad, two each from Ramgarh and Bokaro and one each from Gumla, Lohardaga, Chatra and Giridih.
