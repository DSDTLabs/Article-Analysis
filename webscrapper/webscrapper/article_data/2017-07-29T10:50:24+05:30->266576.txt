GANDHINAGAR: With six   MLAs having resigned in the last two days and speculations about more following suit in the next week, there is speculation in BJP circles that   (before the scheduled time of December) will be called soon after the   elections. The BJP may dissolve the house and have elections before Diwali.

 A senior BJP leader said, “Party president Amit Shah and chief minister   on Thursday at a party meeting clearly hinted that MLAs should get ready for elections before Diwali. The party is at it’s best in the state after the Shankersinh Vaghela, Balwantsinh Rajput and other several MLAs resigned from the Congress and most of them joined the BJP. It is likely that that party may choose to cash in on the all favourable environment.”
 
 A senior   who attended the meeting on Thursday said, “Amitbhai and the CM indicated that we have to maximize the benefits of the recent damage to the Congress by Vaghela and the others and not give them time to reorganize and regain strength. Moreover, Congress MLAs who came on the assurance of BJP tickets may also not want to take more time. The party may choose to have elections before Diwali (October 19) to take advantage of the festive mood.”
