BHOPAL: Fooling around with a countrymade pistol cost a youth his life in Bhopal’s   locality on Tuesday night. Priyansh Soni, 20, had brought the gun with him from Sagar and was showing off to friends when it went off, say police.

 The bullet pierced Soni’s head and exited the other side, scraping the chest of a friend, who had a narrow escape. The impact plastered brains and skull splinters all over the room. Police have not ruled out foul and have detained his friends for questioning. 
 
 SI Ramesh Rai said Soni’s father works in Sagar Municipal Corporation. He came to Bhopal on Monday on friend Sourabh Rai’s bike and they put up with their buddies   and Avinash in Gautam Nagar. On Tuesday, there were five youths in the flat — Soni, Sourabh, Avinash,   and Shubham. Around 6pm, they went to Bittan Market and bought a bottle of liquor on the way back. They came back to the room and started drinking. Shubham and Mohit went out to watch   and returned with two more friends — Aman Thakur and Zuber — and their girlfriends. 
 
 Soni, Sourabh, Aman and Zuber were in one room when Soni took out his gun, loaded a bullet and started fooling around, the others have told police. He then started pointing the gun at them and on his temple, threatening to shoot. Moments later, the gun went off. The others heard the shot and came running to find Soni dead in a pool of blood. They informed police on Dial 100.
 
 ASP   said the circumstances of the incident seem suspicious. Senior FSL scientist Dinesh Sharma, who examined the spot, shared the suspicions. “The bullet pierced Soni’s head from the left and exited from the right, but Priyansh was right handed. It seems he was standing when the shot was fired. Things will become clear after receiving the PM report,” said a source.
