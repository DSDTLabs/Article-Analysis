We do not know what happened but they were drunk and started abusing and beating my younger son when he asked them about the vehicle. My son was killed in front of my eyes yet I was helpless,“ the anguished father Abdul Saeed told TOI. Saeed alleges that the four smashed Salman's head against a tanker but there is no mention of it in the FIR.
