 "In India, a child is sexually abused every 15 minutes; rape is the fourth most common crime against women in India. It’s sad that after so much discussions around the topic, there is a steady rise in incidents of sexual harassment. This means there is a need for more awareness around the issue. Only when we talk about it, the survivors would open up and criminals will step back" said  , a participant.
