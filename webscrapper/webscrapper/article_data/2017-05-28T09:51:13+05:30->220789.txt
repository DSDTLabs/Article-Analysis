BHOPAL: Three days after the Harda district collector   was transferred, the state government on Saturday cancelled his earlier order. On May 24 he was transferred to secretariat in the state capital as deputy secretary, mining.

 Bhanot, was replaced by another officer Tarun Rathi. A fresh order issued by general administration department (GAD) said, “Henceforth, the earlier order stands cancelled. Bhanoth will continue as collector Harda.”
 
 The decision has come as a surprise to political observers, who are linking it with former minister Kamal Patel’s belligerence against the state government. Patel, had played up the issue of illegal sand mining in Narmada and went ahead and filed a petition with the   (NGT), Central Zone bench, Bhopal, much to the embarrassment of the state government.
 
 Political circles are agog with rumours that Bhanot, who had invoked provisions under the National Security Act and banished Patel’s son from the Harda district limits, was under fire from the former minister. Patel made the official’s transfer a prestige issue. State BJP has already issued a notice to Patel on the issue.
 
 All efforts to contact   to get his response on cancellation of collector's transfer failed his phone remained switched off.
