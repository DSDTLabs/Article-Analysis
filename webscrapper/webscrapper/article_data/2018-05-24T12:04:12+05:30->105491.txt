After the success of ‘Chootay Maatay’,   is back with another song ‘Golden Rang’. Scheduled to release on May 26, the song will be a romantic number.

 With KV Dhillon’s music and Penny’s lyrics, the song will hopefully strike the right chord with the audience.
 
 Besides the genre, nothing much about the song has been revealed. However, looking at the poster and the social media posts that Guri fed to the audience, the location seems to be rich in white sand and blue sea.
 
 Though ‘Chootay Maatay’ and the soon to be released song ‘Golden Rang’ are different in genre, as the first one was a peppy fun track, while the latter is expected to be a romantic melody, Guri’s look looks same in both the numbers.
