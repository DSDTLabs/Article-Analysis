HOLALKERE (KARNATAKA): BJP chief Amit Shah attacked   CM   at a rally in Holalkere on Wednesday, days after the CM had questioned the Centre’s contribution to the state. “Arrey, CM Siddaramaiah ne humse hisaab maanga hai, hum unhein hisaab dene Karnataka aaye hain (The CM has asked for the accounts of the Centre’s contribution, I am here to give the accounts),” Shah said.

 According to him, Karnataka had received Rs 3 lakh crore from the Centre under the  . 
 
 “Now, the people of Karnataka are asking for accounts from you. Where has all the money gone? If you (the people) want to know where the money siphoned off by the   government has gone, look at the nearest Congress leader in your village. He would’ve constructed a four-floor apartment and has a brand new car in front of his home, whereas five years ago he was staying in a hut and had a Luna,” Shah said.
 
 Choosing Holalkere for his first rally outside Bengaluru, BJP sources said Shah wanted to reach out primarily to the Congress vote bank of backward castes, numbering over 35,000 in this reserved constituency.
