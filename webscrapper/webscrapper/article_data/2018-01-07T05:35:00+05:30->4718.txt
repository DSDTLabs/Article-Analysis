Nagpur: The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India, which has approached the Supreme Court seeking expansion of the ban on manja by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), stated that glass-coated cotton threads are equally deadly for humans, animals and birds.

 In 2016, NGT had imposed an interim nationwide ban on the use of glass-coated manja for kite flying. However, in July 2017, NGT restricted the ban to only nylon or synthetic thread.
 
 Though NGT has banned threads coated with synthetic material, PETA stated that the order doesn’t serve the purpose as there is no scientific way of testing the coating.
 
 “The cotton manjas available in markets might be coated with metals and not just glass. This is the reason why they are good conductors of electricity and lead to electrocution,” said Nikunj Sharma, lead, Public Policy of PETA India.
 
 He said there have been many cases of injuries due to cotton manjas which were coated. “All forms of coated manjas are dangerous. Only plain cotton threads, popularly known as ‘saddi’ and were traditionally used for kite-flying, should be allowed,” said Sharma, adding that glass is also non-biodegradable and harmful for the environment.
