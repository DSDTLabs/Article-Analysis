VADODARA:   has done the impossible at 5,360 m above sea level! 

 Maripelly Praveen, 31, has performed 108   at the base camp of Mount Everest in under 27 minutes.
 
 Praveen, an MFA graduate from the MSU’s Faculty of Fine Arts, is the youngest recipient of the  . He is also teaches yoga at Yog Niketan in the city.
 
 “I have been doing yoga for a very long time but I started doing Surya Namaskars daily since 2013. Since then, I have continuously performed Surya Namaskars 108 times every day for the past four years. But I wanted to do this on a bigger scale since anybody can do it on sea level. So I challenged myself,” Praveen said.
 
 Praveen had already cleared his challenge last year in August when he performed the Surya Namaskar at base of the   in Himachal Pradesh. “The conditions on Everest are deplorable. The temperature is minus 15 degree Celsius. Harsh winds and permanent fresh snow make it nearly impossible to do yoga since there is no flat, horizontal hard surface to exercise,” Praveen added.
 
 During the 14 day journey from Kathmandu in Nepal to the base camp and back, Praveen performed the Surya Namaskar 108 times daily totaling 1,512 Surya Namaskars. He did this to acclimatize to the weather and oxygen deprivation.
 
 “After reaching base camp, I had no place to perform the yoga. I had to climb to a small outcrop overlooking the cliff-side. It was dangerous for me, but I had to do it,” Said Praveen.
 
 Praveen now plans to repeat his achievement again at 6,000 m above sea level at the Everest.
