MUMBAI: The city and its suburbs experienced a record spell of rain accompanied by strong winds since Tuesday afternoon, reviving memories of the August 29 deluge that paralysed life in the city. As students, office-goers and others rushed for safety, rumours and old tweets circulating on social media added to the confusion and anxiety. However, with the intensity of rain growing, state education minister Vinod Tawde's office declared late at night that all schools and colleges in the Mumbai region would remain closed on Wednesday.

 On Tuesday, the city saw its highest September rain in a decade in 15 hours. Santacruz (225.3mm) recorded extremely heavy rain, while Colaba logged 169.6mm. Many localities were flooded. Rain recorded at BMC's automatic weather stations between 8am and 10pm included Nariman Point (88mm), Worli (110mm), Chembur (112mm), Andheri (208mm), Bandra (128mm) and Borivli (204mm).
 
 Train services were delayed but fortunately not derailed. Operations at Mumbai airport were suspended for half an hour in the evening due to poor visibility. They were again suspended around 10pm for 2.5 hours after a SpiceJet flight overshot the runway.
 
 On the brighter side, IMD has forecast intermittent spells of moderate rainfall with heavy showers at some places on Wednesday.
