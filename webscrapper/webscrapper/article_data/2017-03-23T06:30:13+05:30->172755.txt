VISAKHAPATNAM: The state government’s   project, meant for rural health care, is nearing completion of one year. Despite the more or less successful implementation of the project, there are a few challenges faced by the authorities.

  provides a convergence of services for identification, screening, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment, follow up and referral of high risk cases in each rural habitation. In April 2016, mobile medical units (MMU) were launched as a part of the Chandranna Sanchara Chikitsa project in AP. The MMUs serve over 12,000 villages in 13 districts of AP.
 
 In a few tribal pockets, there were some difficulties in implementation of the project due to the remoteness and inaccessibility of the area as well as problems posed by ignorance and lack of health awareness, especially in the Agency areas. 
 
 According to Piramal Swasthya, part of  , the execution partner for this project in the state, one of the major challenges in the execution is to provide doctors to man every MMU. Vishal Phanse, CEO,   said, “In the initial stages of the project, it was a challenge to provide doctors to man every MMU. However, later, we were able to successfully mitigate that challenge by providing doctors for all the MMUs that reach over 12,000 far-flung and remote villages of the state. Also, in rural parts of the state, creating awareness for maternal and adolescent health and NCDs (non-cmommunicable diseases) such as diabetes and hypertension is a challenge that we are focusing on. With technology-enabled solutions being a unique feature the project, IT infrastructure involving data management needs to be maintained constantly.”
