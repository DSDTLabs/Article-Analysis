AHMEDABAD: Shahibaug police on Tuesday apprehended a man who sent a threatening letter to a bank manager, demanding Rs 5 lakh cash.

 Investigators said the manager of the State Bank of India (SBI)’s Girdharnagar branch received a letter last week where the sender identified himself as a ‘Pakistani.’ The letter said he had weapons but no local currency and threatened to shoot the manager if he failed to provide Rs 5 lakh as instructed.
 
 “A team was deployed near   on Tuesday morning. This was the spot the letter stipulated that the cash be dropped off, wrapped in a red cloth, near a post box. The money was kept there as instructed. A man came to the spot and picked up the bundle. He was apprehended. The man was identified as Mukesh Chauhan,” said Mukesh Zala, sub-inspector of Shahibaug police station.
 
 Investigators said Chauhan is a sanitation worker. “He is not revealing why he targeted the bank and why he wanted the money. The Shahibaug area had earlier reported a similar incident earlier too, where money was demanded through a letter. Investigators are ascertaining whether Chauhan sent similar letters in the past,” said an official.
