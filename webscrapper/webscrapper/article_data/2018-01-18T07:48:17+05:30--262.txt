AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Wednesday asked the   to   of Rs 50,000 to one   from Surendranagar who was not released from jail for five days even after court orders.

 A bench of Justice Abhilasha Kumari and Justice B N Karia held that keeping a person in jail even after courts’ express orders for release was illegal detention by the jail authorities. Besides the compensation amount, the government will also have to shell out Rs 10,000 to the prisoner for his legal expenditure.
 
 Belim was sent to Surendranagar sub-jail by a family court towards punishment for not paying maintenance amount to his wife and children on court orders. In August last year, he was sentenced to jail term of 65 days for default in payment to his wife Shabana. Later in October, the same court again punished him with 105-day imprisonment for non-payment.
 
 A magisterial court in Surendranagar also ordered to keep Belim in jail for 114 days for not paying maintenance to his wife under the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.
 
 After going to jail, Belim agreed to make payment to his wife and settled the issue and both the courts put an end to his incarceration. On December 1, Belim first furnished an order from the family court stating that he should be released, if he was not wanted in any other matter. A similar order from the magisterial court was also presented.
 
 However, the jail superintendent did not release him. Belim’s lawyers obtained a special order from the magisterial court for his release on December 4. Yet, the jail authority allegedly did not release him.
 
 When Belim’s kin moved the HC and a notice was issued, he was released on December 9 evening. His advocate Salim Saiyed insisted that it was an illegal detention and Belim should be paid compensation for this.
