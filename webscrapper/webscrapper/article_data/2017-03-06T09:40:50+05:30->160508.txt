GUWAHATI: Rina (name changed), 27, spent   on the   last week before she was rescued by   and handed over to the   on Sunday. She was allegedly   and held captive by three men somewhere in northwest Delhi's Shakurpur area. 

 She was handed over to the state police after being provided proper medical facilities and counselling. Missing since February 24, she was taken to New Delhi by the trio under the pretext of offering a good job.
 
 "State police have taken the trio into custody and will begin questioning them. Identified as Subham Gosai (25), Sagar Rout (25) and Ranjan Koiri (28), they have been apprehended as suspected operators of a racket for trafficking women from Assam to Delhi and other states," a state police official said.
 
 A police source said the victim had left her house after a heated argument with her family members when the traffickers found her. "She wanted to work and earn money like others her age, so she ran away from her house. She then reached the Guwahati railway station when she met the accused, who convinced her to travel to Delhi with them, promising her a job," police sources said.
 
 Investigation revealed that after she reached Delhi, the trio asked her to work as a domestic help. Sensing something suspicious, she managed to make a phone call to her family here before the trio took her mobile phone away, destroyed it and locked her forcibly inside a room at an unknown place.
 
 Fearing police action, the trio subsequently abandoned her at the New Delhi railway station. "Not familiar with the city and no money left, she started living on the roadside outside the railway station," said police.
 
 Police traced the victim following an inquiry was made from auto and taxi drivers, coolies and shopkeepers in the area.
