THANE A Thane resident has been arrested for allegedly cheating three banks and an insurance company of lakhs by fabricating records of his first wife from whom he is now divorced. The police said that the accused,   (49) forged his first wife's signature and used the photo of his second wife on documents to access the funds. 

 Gaud divorced his wife in 2016. Soon after the divorce, he opened three new bank accounts in his former wife's name, by forging her signature but used the photographs of his second wife to open these accounts. 
 
 He then struck a sale deed of some property and took a token amount and he also encashed an insurance policy which had matured, both of which were in his first wife's name. Gaud had the physical documents for both-the property and the insurance policy-although they were in his first wife's name. 
 
 "In this manner, he made Rs 20 lakhwithout his first wife knowing anything about it," said a police officer. "The proceeds for both were credited to the new account he had opened with his new wife."
 
 The fraud came to light in January when his first wife learnt that the property sale deal was negotiated. "She found out that the proceeds had been credited to a bank account in her name-an account she was not even aware of," said the officer. That's when Gaud's first wife lodged a complaint at   police station. The bank account led the police to Gaud.
 
 His second wife is absconding, said the police. "Things will be clear once she is held," said an officer.
