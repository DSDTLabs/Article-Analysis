Jaipur: Independent councillor Sushil Sharma on Wednesday gave a serious message about the Jaipur Municipal Corporation’s functioning in a comical way.

 Sharma’s picture went viral on social media, when he was caught repairing a sewerage chamber top in Murli pura scheme. While talking to TOI he said, “Now elected representatives are forced to carry out work on their own as officials are paying heed to complaints of the residents.”
 
 He decided to take up the repair work of a sewerage chamber on his own to settle the dispute between two neighbours. He claimed, “The fight could have been intensified, if the repair work was not done on time. One neighbour was throwing garbage in the sewerage chamber after the lid of the chamber broke. The other neighbour raised objection as this could lead to serious blockage of sewerage lines. To immediately resolve the matter, I took up the repair work.”
 
 Residents of the society alleged that despite several complaints JMC officials did not take up the repair work. “The JMC did not invite tender of desilting and sewerage lines repair work. The previous contractor is not willing to take up work as his complete payment is not done by the JMC,” alleged Sharma.
