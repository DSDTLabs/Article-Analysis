LUCKNOW: Two days ahead of the seventh and last phase of UP assembly elections,   chief   attacked Prime Minister   for not constituting Lok Pal as it would hit the   government first.

 “The reason BJP government speaks of taking action against corrupt politicians and babus but doesn't constitute the Lok Pal is that it would hit their own people,“ said Mayawati, speaking to reporters in Lucknow, on Monday .
 
 Mayawati also accused the PM of gaining “sadistic pleasure“ out of his demonetisation scheme which affected the poor. “That was another example of the BJP being anti-poor. It did not realise the impact of an ill-planned scheme on poor,“ she said, adding that it was because of these decisions that BJP leaders were trying to divert people's attention with road shows, which were nothing by `nautanki' (theatrics).
 
 `Babua because CM talks like a kid'
 
 Mayawati mocked SP president chief minister Akhilesh Yadav saying she called him a `Babua' since he spoke like a child. “ He says stone elephants are standing, sitting...even a kid knows stone elephants can't move,“ she remarked, adding that Akhilesh was just like his father Mulayam Singh Yadav.
