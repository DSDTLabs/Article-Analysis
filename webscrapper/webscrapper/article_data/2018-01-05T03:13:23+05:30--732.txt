GUWAHATI: A day after   CM   termed the updation of Assam’s National Register of Citizenship ( ) a ‘conspiracy’ against Bengalis, alleging their exclusion from from the first draft, she was booked for hate speech on Thursday. The FIR followed complaints by several lawyers who alleged that her speech was inflammatory and could promote enmity between different groups in  . 

 However, All India Mahila Congress chief and Silchar MP Sushmita Dev backed Mamata, saying: “A large share of the Bengali population here also feels a conspiracy is brewing against them.” According to a 2013 report of the commissioner for linguistic minorities, Bengali-speaking people constitute 27.55% of Assam’s population. 
 
 Dev said that in upper Assam, dominated by tea tribes and the Ahoms, there were some districts where the first draft had covered 70% of the population. “However, in Bengali-dominated Cachar region, only 29% of the population has been covered,” she added.   MP Ripun Borah has submitted a memorandum to the registrar general of India alleging “deliberate negligence” in the verification of citizenship claims.
 
 He said improper verification at 208 NRC   of 13 districts had resulted in the names of only 10% of the population appearing in the first draft.
