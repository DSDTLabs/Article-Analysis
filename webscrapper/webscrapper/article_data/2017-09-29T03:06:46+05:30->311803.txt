Mumbai: An inspired elder   helped four Mumbaikars get a new lease of life on Thursday when he donated the   of his 45-year-old brother who was declared brain dead at civic–run  . Around the same time, a few kilometres away at Mahim’s Hinduja Hospital, the wife of a 53-year-old brain dead man donated three organs.

 With this, the number of cadaver   in the city this year has climbed to 43. “With Thursday’s donations, we registered six cadaver donations in September,’’ said Dr S K Mathur of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC), which coordinates organ-sharing between hospitals. “Best of all, two of the donations came from public hospitals,’’ he added. The family of a 42-year-old woman donated her organs at state-government-run JJ Hospital in Byculla on September 5.
 
 In the case of Sion Hospital, the donor, John Abraham, lived in Pune. “He was not in regular touch with us, but police said he fell off a local train near Sion on September 18,’’ said his brother, Regi, who travelled from Alleppey in Kerala. When Sion Hospital’s doctors said John was brain dead, Regi asked them if his organs could be donated. “The donation was motivated by the brother,’’ said a doctor from Sion Hospital, which was the first hospital in Mumbai where a cadaver donation took place in 1997.
 
 Thursday’s donation marked the first heart donation from Sion Hospital. The heart was transplanted into a heart failure patient at Fortis Hospital, Mulund. His liver was donated to a patient at civic-run KEM, while his kidneys were donated to patients at Sion and Hinduja Hospital. 
 
 In the second cadaver transplant at Hinduja Hospital, the liver and one kidney were donated to patients at Global Hospital, Parel. The other kidney was transplanted into a patient at Hinduja itself.
