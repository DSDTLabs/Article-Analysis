AHMEDABAD: Taking serious note of the killing of a female   in Danta, chief minister   formed a three-member fact-finding committee. The committee will be headed by former principal chief conservator S C Pant.

  A state government release said the committee will study the whole incident and report to the government in 30 days. The committee, apart from Pant, will have additional principal chief conservator of forests Akshay Saxena and chief conservator of Vadodara circle Ram Kumar.
 
 Sources said the government was forced to order the inquiry after animal rights activists, environmentalists, and union minister for women and child development Menaka Gandhi were furious at the forest department officials and demanded that the chief wildlife warden be sacked. Gandhi expressed her displeasure at the state govt’s failure to save the sloth bear.
 
 Officials in the forest department said wildlife activists cried foul over the way the forest department shot dead a female sloth bear near the Balaram wildlife sanctuary. Banaskantha superintendent of police had also ordered an inquiry into the actions of a constable, who was seen taking a selfie with the dead bear. The bear had killed three humans after which it was shot dead.
 
 N G Jayasimha, managing director,   said the way in which the hunt was conducted brought shame to the birthplace of the Mahatma Gandhi. “How the photographs depict this power is disgusting,” he said.
 
 A former principal chief conservator of forests, who asked not to be named, said this was a cold-blooded encounter to by the police avenge the killing of their own men. The   said that from the photographs on social media, it was clear it was that police was sent with an order to shot the bear dead. He said the men who were part of the operation were wearing bulletproof jackets and were equipped with automatic weapons. “From the photographs, it appears as if the police were on a terrorist operation, combating someone with weapons.”
