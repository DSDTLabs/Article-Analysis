Chandigarh: After the tax branch of the municipal corporation, Chandigarh, sent   notices to the offices of Congress and BJP parties in Chandigarh and Punjab state, only Punjab Congress responded to the notice and cleared partial dues. 

 Rest of the three offices neither paid the tax nor communicated with the authority in this regard. The tax branch of the civic body is all set to slap second notice on the said violators and give them a last chance to pay the tax and if not paid, the said offices will be sealed. As per the issued tax notice, all the said political parties had to deposit the tax amount till December 31.
 
 “We have received Rs 6 lakh from Punjab Congress against Rs 15.52 lakhs. They have been asking to waive-off penalty charges, which we have out-rightly refused. Besides Punjab Congress, none of the representatives of the other political parties’ offices have responded to our notices,” sources in the MC revealed.
 
 The tax branch had issued notice of Rs 16.38 lakh to Punjab BJP, Rs 15.52 lakh to Punjab Congress, Rs 7.13 lakh to Chandigarh BJP and Rs 4.71 to Chandigarh Congress offices.
 
 When asked, additional municipal commissioner Anil Kumar Garg said, “The political parties didn’t pay the amount in the stipulated period. Now, we are going to give a second notice to them and if not adhered to, we will start seal their office.”
