BRUSSELS: The  's top court has ruled that the bloc's economic sanctions on Russian companies over the crisis in Ukraine are valid.

 The   of Justice's decision today came in response to a legal challenge by Russian oil and gas giant   before a British court.
 
 Rosneft wants to annul a decision by   leaders in July 2014 to restrict certain financial transactions and sensitive exports imposed after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.
 
 The Luxembourg-based ECJ said the "restrictive measures" adopted in response to the crisis in Ukraine against certain Russian undertakings, including Rosneft, are "valid."
