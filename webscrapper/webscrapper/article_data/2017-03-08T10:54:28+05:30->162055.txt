HYDERABAD: Three bullets fired by suspect   felled 32-year-old aviation engineer   in Austin's Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas, US, on February 22. The details of the crime have been revealed in an affidavit with the   judge.

 The fact that   was fired upon three times indicates that the white suspect was determined to kill the Telugu man. His friend   suffered a bullet injury and is out of danger.
 
 Purinton, a veteran, had medals pinned to his white navy T-shirt and wore a scarf when he carried out unprovoked firing on Kuchibotla. After his argument with Kuchibhotla and Madasani in the bar, there were no ominous portends of his deadly intentions.But Purinton came back after 30 minutes, with a gun.
 
 “He's back and he has a gun,“ the fear-stricken people in the bar shouted as Purinton made his re-entry . He headed straight to the bar's patio area and shot Kuchibhotla before turning the gun on Madasani. Clearly Purinton had come back with a vengeance.
 
 The affidavit says that Purinton had asked the two Indians if their status was legal.However, he was sent out of the bar when Ian Grillot, the man who tried to save the life of Srinivas, and another person intervened. Grillot who went after gun-weilding Purinton also came under the firing. He underwent treatment for a bullet injury.
 
 Police conversations on radio after the incident give an insight into what happened when they got there. “The white male has a black and white scarf around his head.The subject was seen running west. Apparently the suspect had a handgun,“ police dispatches from Johnson County public safety network described the scene after the incident. “Now we know the suspect's name is Adam and he is a white male,“ the police dispatches reveal immediately after the incident as could be made out from the conversation. Later, Adam Purinton was arrested and jailed. The FBI is also investigating the incident as a hate crime.
