 "It was a one-sided contest. Mary controlled every second of the bout. She played well and scored with good hot shots. It was good first bout and she is now into the medal stage," India's boxing coach   said.
 
 "You can see her experience. The only thing I would like to see is more body shots as she is scoring almost exclusively to the head. It's an overall scoring in the new system on the dominance of the round. Good blows on the target area will earn you points," he added.
