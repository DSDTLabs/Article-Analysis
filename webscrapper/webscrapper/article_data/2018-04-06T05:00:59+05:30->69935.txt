MUMBAI: Mumbai metropolitan region will finally get a 250-metre   track at Panvel to conduct fitness examination of commercial vehicles like autos, taxis, trucks and buses. This is mandatory as per directives of the Bombay high court. 

  State transport minister   will inaugurate the new test track on Sunday. 
 
 Panvel regional transport officer   said, "The track has come up with   funding and it is on collector land. We will commence fitness tests for 125 trucks and buses, and for 50 taxis/autos daily. The track will ensure technical inspection of vehicles, and unless it is road-worthy, we will not give a clearance."
 
  A thorough fitness test of commercial vehicles ensures   and also prevents mishaps. "One of the reasons for fatal mishaps in the past has been pathetic condition of commercial vehicles and technical failures, leading to accidents," said an official. 
 
 The court had directed all RTOs in Maharashtra, including those in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai, to set up 250-metre brake test tracks. In Mumbai, the deadline for setting up tracks is April 30, but officials at the four city RTOs are still scouting for space.
 
 "We are trying to get the plot adjacent to Tardeo RTO to set up the track," said official. In the western suburbs, an open plot in Oshiwara is being considered, sources added.
