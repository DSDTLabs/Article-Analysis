MUMBAI: The Bombay   has directed   to evict a woman tenant from a dilapidated building that is to be redeveloped under the Rs 4,000 crore   cluster   project. A division bench of justice Anoop Mohta and justice Anuja Prabhudessai asked the authorities to take the help of the police in case the tenant does not cooperate and vacate the premises in two weeks. 

 Sugra Begum who lives on the ground floor of Sharafally Moomji Chawl was the last hold out in the building, with 53 other tenants having vacated their premises and shifting to the transit accommodation. 
 
 “In the interest of justice and people at large and to avoid further complications and to avoid any mishap or any accident, we are inclined to order even forceful eviction,” said the judges. The court pointed out that under section 77 of the Mhada Act, the authorities are empowered to take all action that is necessary for the development of a project. 
 
 The court was hearing a petition filed by the trustees of the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust, that is implementing the project. The project envisages the demolition of 250 dilapidated buildings, 1,250 shops and the rehabilitation of 3,200 families living in the area. The trust approached the high court claiming that Mhada authorities had failed to evict the lone tenant. The tenant had cited pending litigation in the small causes court and claimed that the property belongs to the Wakf board to stall eviction. The court observed that it could not adjudicate the issue raised by the tenant at this stage.
