The Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) will be partially shut down till April 30, first for   rehearsals, the show and later, for runway upgradation work.
The upgrade has been designed to support the growing air traffic at the Bengaluru airport. During the upgrade, Rapid exit taxiways (RETs) are being constructed to improve air traffic movement.
 “Passenger convenience will be ensured with airlines sharing communication on the change in airport operations and revised flight timings during the length of the 2017 Aero India show,” KIA said in an official release.
 The upgrade, which will be conducted in a phased manner, will also involve partial closure of facilities without any impact on airport operations. Airlines that will be impacted have already received communication about the reduced operating hours and will inform passengers accordingly. Revised flight schedules will be updated on www.bengaluruairport.com. Information will be also be available on the airport’s app and twitter handle, @BLRAirport.
 But will the partial closure of the airport translate into a spike in train travel bookings, especially in short-distance sectors?  , Senior Divisional Commercial Manager, Bengaluru, thinks otherwise. “A 1-2% hike in passengers will not be noticeable considering that we handle 10 lakh passengers per day. Moreover, people who want to fly will fly, even if it means taking an early morning flight.”
