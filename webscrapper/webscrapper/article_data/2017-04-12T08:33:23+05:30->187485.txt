 Dr Sravan Kumar, superintendent Gandhi hospital, said cases of swine flu in children in state is rare and a matter of concern. “There is possibility that the children must have contacted the virus from their mothers, who are asymptomatic carriers, without showing any symptoms,. They would not know that they have swine flu. This kind of infection without treatment reduces on its own over a period time“.
 
 Hospital authorities are collecting throat swabs of mothers of the affected children so as to confirm the mode of virus spread among the children.Doctors say that mothers might have not handled the kids properly as the human contact is the most common reason for spread of swine flu.

This indicates the rapid spread of the virus,“ one of the doctors said. Officials are even planning a   of present pattern of the virus.
