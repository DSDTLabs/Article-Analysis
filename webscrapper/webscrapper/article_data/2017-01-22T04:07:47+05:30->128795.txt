MUMBAI: Minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, on Saturday, that the service   on   travels conducted by   (PTO) should be waived off. 

 Around 45,000   may choose PTOs for Haj. While around 1,25,000 will go through Haj Committee of India. 
 
 Several PTOs, which have received circulars from the Centre about paying the service tax, told Naqvi that if their operations were not exempted from the service tax, Haj travel for pilgrims choosing PTOs will be a lot more costlier. “I think it is unfair to the PTOs and the pilgrims to be slapped with service tax,” said Naqvi. He added that since all pilgrimages in India are exempted from tax on travel, Haj pilgrims too should be exempted from it. He also suggested that the tour operators should rename themselves and not call themselves tour operators.
