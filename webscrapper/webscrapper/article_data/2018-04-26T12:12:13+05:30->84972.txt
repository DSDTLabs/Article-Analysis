NEW DELHI: A stunning spike in batting form has seen Ambati Rayudu surge to the top of an extremely close   run-scorers’ table, and with it take the Orange Cap for most runs from Kane Williamson. 

 
 
 
 
 In his last two innings for table-toppers CSK, Rayudu has slammed 79 off 37 balls and 82 off 53 which has taken him to the top of the batting table. However, he is just three runs ahead of AB de Villiers, who on Wednesday smoked 68 off 30 balls against   to lead the table until Rayudu’s barn-storming half-century propelled his franchise to a stunning five-wicket win when chasing Royal Challengers Bangalore’s 205/8. 
 
 
 
 
 At this place on the batting table is Sunrisers Hyderabad captain Williamson, who until the CSK v   match was the owner of the Orange Cap after scoring 259 runs in six innings. With SRH playing Kings XI Punjab today, Williamson could once again surge to the top and regain the Orange Cap given that his recent innings have yielded scores of 50, 54, 84 and 29. 
 
 RCB skipper Virat Kohli is 10 runs behind Williamson with 249 runs, and 10 short of him is Rajasthan Royals’ wicketkeeper-batsman Sanju Samson with 239. KL Rahul has 236, and like Williamson looks primed to move up the batting charts today as   face SRH. 
 
 For bowlers, Mumbai Indians’ 20-year-old spinner Mayank Markhande remains the holder of the Purple Cap for most wickets (10). In an equally closely contested bowling table, however, he is followed by four pace bowlers level on nine wickets - SRH seamer Siddarth Kaul, Delhi Daredevils’ spearhead Trent Boult, KXIP’s Andrew Tye and Umesh Yadav of RCB. 
 
 Markhande, who in his first season of the   has so far taken 3/32, 4/23, 1/25, and 2/15 apart from two wicketless outings, could lose the Purple Cap today given that Kaul and Tye are part of today’s SRH v KXIP match-up. 
 
 On eight wickets each are Sunil Narine, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur and Chris Woakes.
