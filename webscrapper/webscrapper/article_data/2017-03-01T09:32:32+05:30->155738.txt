TRICHY: A fast track mahila court in Karur has awarded   to two people accused of attempting to murder a woman and slapped a fine of Rs 1 lakh on each of them. The court also convicted a doctor hailing from   district in this regard and handed him three years   for providing fake medical certificate with the motive of safeguarding an accused. 

 According to the prosecution, the mahila court convicted Nataraj and Vasudevan imposing life term jail and a fine of Rs 1 lakh each on them besides three year rigorous imprisonment on the doctor T Sam Ilango. The doctor who is presently working as a food safety officer in Dindigul was working in a primary health centre and running a private clinic at the time of the crime. 
 
 The couple Kandasamy and Bhanumathi were residing at Ram Nagar in Vennaimalai in Karur district. Kandasamy's aunty Palaniammal had filed a case at the district court against one Nataraj, 53, of   in Karur who was constructing a house on a piece of disputed land. Whenever Palaniammal appeared before the court in connection with the case, Bhanumathi used to accompany her. This infuriated Nataraj who weaved a plot to eliminate Bhanumathi. 
 
 On June 18, 2008, Nataraj hacked Bhanumathi and eight others including Vasudevan, Mohanraj, Palanisamy and Senthil. However, she escaped with grievous injuries. On the basis of a complaint, Vengamedu police registered a case and arrested all the nine. During the investigation, it came to light that Dr T Sam Ilango had provided a fake medical certificate stating that the main accused Nataraj was under his observation for fever on the day of the attack. The court acquitted six other persons in the case.
