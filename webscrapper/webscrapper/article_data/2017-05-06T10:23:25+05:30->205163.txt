CHANDIGARH: A day after taking over as the new   chief,   held a meeting with Congress   Rahul Gandhi in Delhi on Friday. He will also be meeting with the party president Sonia Gandhi there on Saturday. 

 Jakhar said Rahul told him he should focus on further strengthening the party's organizational set up in the state. "I assured him that I will give the responsibility my best shot," said the former Congress legislature party (CLP) leader in Punjab.
 
 Sources said Rahul also offered to make himself available to come down to the Punjab whenever the state unit needed him. The Gandhi scion added that he was sure that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Jakhar will make a good team.
 
 It is believed that Jakhar was Rahul's pick and his stint as the   leader and considerable popularity with the party legislators worked for him even though he had lost his Abohar seat in recent assembly polls.
 
 Meanwhile, speculations are rife that a new Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) would be put in place shortly and an attempt would be made to suitably reward the party workers who helped the party win 77 seats in the assembly elections this year.
 
 In the run up to the elections, a large number of party secretaries were appointed in the state as part of a 'please-all' policy. The party has already accommodated senior vice-president Lal Singh as the Punjab Mandi Board chairman.
