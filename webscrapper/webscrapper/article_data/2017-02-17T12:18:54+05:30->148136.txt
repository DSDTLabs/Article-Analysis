BHOPAL: Despite tall claims of  , over 20 lakh adults in the state are still illiterate. In a bid to improve the literacy rate, the state government has created a work force of 12,000 students, including girls, who are contributing under the “Sakshar Bharat”

They have been given a target to make at least 40 people literate in their village and local areas. The state government has made necessary arrangements for the purpose and provided them with basic facilities like books and board among others. Officials in the secretariat said literacy rate in the state is less than the national average. The number of illiterate people in the state was over 51 lakh till a few years back, but around 30 lakh people have been made illiterate so far in the programme.

Besides, they make the local villagers aware of their rights and government welfare schemes, said officials, adding that such students get academic credits for this. The youths are given training and workshops are organised at the district level to prepare them for addressing the illiteracy issue in state. It is the initiative of the Rajya Shiksha Kendra. Officials said from March 2016 to August 2016, the number of people made literate is 3.5 lakh. The district collectors have been directed by the government to extend cooperation to the youths involved in the job so that it gets continuous push. The classes for the purpose are conducted as per the convenience of the students, said officials. The classes are also conducted on Sundays in villages, as it suits all and does not compromise their routine work to earn livelihood.
