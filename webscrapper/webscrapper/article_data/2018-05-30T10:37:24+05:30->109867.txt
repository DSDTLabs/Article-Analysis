 LUCKNOW: CBSE class X English exam results turned out to be a surprise for students who were not expecting full marks after a ‘wrong question’.
 
 
 Students said that though the board had declared awarding two extra marks for the error, they didn’t expect a full score as their performance had been affected due to the confusion and chaos created by it.
 
 
 “A 100 in English was beyond my expectation. I cross-checked my marks multiple times. The error in the first section of the paper left us bemused and a lot of our time was wasted waiting for directions. I had to rush after that to answer all questions in time,” said   of Lucknow Public School.
 
 
 Seven of her friends have also scored full marks in English. Animesh   of   said, “We feel there was lenient marking in the subject.”
 
 
 Sakshi Yadav of Rani Laxmi Bai School said English helped increase her overall percentage. “It is said that one can’t score full marks in language and literature papers but we proved it wrong,” said   of St Mary’s Inter College.
