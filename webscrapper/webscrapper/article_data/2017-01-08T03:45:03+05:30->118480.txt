THANE: Two persons, including a pharmacist, suspected to be part of a   cartel were arrested in Thane early on Saturday by the Anti-Narcotics Cell (ANC) with 6kg of alprazolam, a psychotropic drug, said to be worth Rs 15 lakh.

  (32) and   (26) were arrested at 3am following a tip-off, said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Parag Manere. The duo was carrying multiple packets of alprazolam, a banned drug, stashed inside their pockets, he added. 
 
 ANC officials said that the duo said they had procured the drugs from a pharmaceutical company in Ambernath. The police have begun a search at the company and are checking if the drug was smuggled out. “It looks like a case of pilferage,” said a police officer. 
 
 The duo has booked under sections 8-C, 20 (illegally possessing psychotropic drug), 22 (seizure of narcotic drug) and 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.
 
 This is the first alprazolam seizure in Thane. A couple of months ago, the city police had unearthed a multi-crore ephedrine racket. In that case, the police had raided the premises of   in   and seized over 20 tonnes of ephedrine, followed by a string of arrests.
