Coimbatore: The Coimbatore Municipal Corporation will soon get a first-of-its-kind  , an innovation lab for water and mobility. The state government has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Germany to set up the lab. 

 The lab will be set up on the Coimbatore corporation premises and funded by Germany. German experts will not only act as consultants for the city corporation projects but also indulge in capacity building and training the corporation engineers in best practices. 
 
 Speaking at a meeting held by the German India Round Table (GIRT), corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan said that the lab will provide integrated-computer technology solutions to various city problems especially waste water management and traffic related issues. Experts from the Indo-German Smart Initiatives (IGSI) participated in the meeting.
 
 Commissioner for municipal administration G Prakash said, “They will provide us with designs and act as consultants for big ticket investments. Experts from other countries will also be invited to the lab.” 
 
 Corporation engineers and consultants will also be an integral part of the innovation lab. “This is the first time that such a lab is being set up in India and we are very proud that Coimbatore has been chosen for it,” said Prakash.
 
 Apart from this, the experts from the IGSI led by Andreas Waldraff, chairman of GIRT headquarters in Berlin suggested various methods to re-design and develop the urban infrastructure of Coimbatore. 
 
 However, Prakash asked them to come up with specific solutions for projects such as road re-designing, storm water drains and waste water treatment. “With growing population and increasing pollution, waste water treatment is the future and it needs to be implemented,” he said. He sought time-bound commitments from the team and requested them to develop technologies specific to the city that will be viable.
