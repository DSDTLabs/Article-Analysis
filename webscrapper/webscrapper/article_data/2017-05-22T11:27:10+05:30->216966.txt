 Albert Roca's side might have their AFC Cup returnleg match at the   four days ago. But Albert Roca's brigade looked a different entity on Sunday, being more adventurous and determined in controlling the title-decider. BFC had two goals ruled t for offside and one at out for offside and one attempt ricocheted off the upright as Mohun Bagan found themselves lucky to hang in there hoping for a turnaround in the extra-times after the 90 minutes of regulation times ended in a goalless stalemate.
 
 But Vineeth had other ideas, seizing the momentum in favour of BFC in a stunning 12-minute spell.
 
 BFC got the rub of the green for the first time in the match when Vineeth's shot took a deflection off Bagan centre-back  , wrongfooting   in the 107th minute.
 
 Then a minute before the final whistle, he provided the coup de grace and sealed the deal beating Bagan goalkeeper with a ferocious grounder.
 
 Bagan -who sparked hopes for defending their title only in patches -returned empty-handed, suffering their first trophy-less season after three years.
