 Initially, the investigators were clueless about the whereabouts of the accused—victim’s sister-in-law Rahat Pathan (23) and her two accomplices Mujjamil Shaikh (26), Mustafa Khan (26)—because they did not left any trail after killing Iqbal. “Iqbal has been staying in the flat alone while his children stayed separately. He has divorced his wife. We got the clue from locals who said that Pathan used to visit the victim’s flat occasionally. Technical help has helped in tracking the accused without few hours after the crime,” said Kundal.
  
 Investigators said that the killing seems to be for many more reasons and robbery was not the prime motive. The accused has been remanded in police custody till January 11.
