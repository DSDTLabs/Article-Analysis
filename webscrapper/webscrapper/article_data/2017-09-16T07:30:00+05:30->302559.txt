Panchkula: The police on Friday booked the father of Manmeet Warraich, the key accused in the Varinder Singh   case, on charges of criminal intimidation of an eyewitness and the complainant.

 Amrik Singh has been booked in a case registered under sections 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Mansa Devi Complex police station. His wife Kuljeet Kaur Warraich is the councillor from ward number 8.
 
 Inspector Harbhajan Singh said the investigating officer is verifying the contents of the case and some details have been sought from cyber cell to reach out to the accused.
 
 Avtar Singh, the complainant, said Amrik and his associates followed him to his as well as his uncle’s place of work in Guru Gobind Singh College, Sector 26, Chandigarh.
 
 Avtar Singh also alleged getting threats over telephone from Amrik and others “asking them to withdraw their statements”. He said, “The caller threatened us of dire consequences if we deposed against Manmeet Singh and Harman.” Harman is first cousin of Manmeet. They are among the nine persons arrested for the murder of Varinder Singh.
 
 On March 13, Varinder was brutally murdered by Manmeet and his friends in Sakteri. His murder was consequent to Avtar’s old enmity with Manmeet and Harman over a game of cricket.
