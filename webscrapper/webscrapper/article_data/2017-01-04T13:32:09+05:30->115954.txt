I am 30-year-old male, born and brought up in India but currently living in USA. My problem is that I find it really hard to socialize and I can only carry on a good conversation with selected people. Also, I find it difficult to control my sexual desire since I am a virgin with no experience with girls whatsoever, not even a kiss. I feel like I have missed out on a lot of fun in life. And now, I have reached a point in life where most of my friends are married or have girlfriends.
 
  Every day I feel like an idiot for not having a girlfriend. Is it normal for man to be a virgin,   with   at 30 years of age. Will I ever get those days of fun back? -
