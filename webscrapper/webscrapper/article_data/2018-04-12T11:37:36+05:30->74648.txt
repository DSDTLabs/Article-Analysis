CHANDIGARH: Irregular door-to-door collection of waste is one of the concerns that the Federation of Sector Welfare Associations of Chandigarh ( ) is going to raise with the municipal corporation. Various resident welfare associations (RWAs) have complained that the contractors charge full payment but pick up   at their own whims and fancies.

 The contractors’ services are irregular and the residents have no option but to wait for the employee to visit their house. Residents pay the contractors even floor-wise but still the collection workers are not answerable to them. M L Saili, adviser of the   of Sector 32, said it had become a serious problem for the residents to verify the credentials of the workers who turned up at doorstep for the collection of the garbage. “The person to whom the contract is given by the authorities is used to outsourcing the work to a company that keeps changing its employees,” he said.
 
 Sector-32 RWA patron   said the MC had issued the identity cards to the garbage-collection employees but the resident welfare associations were unable to distribute it among them, as the staff that comes to do the collection is not of the company that was hired by the municipal authorities.  , president of the government houses residents welfare society of Sector 22, said his area had a similar issue and soon it residents wee to take it up with the contractor concerned. “The MC has notified the rates for garbage collection and they cannot overcharge the residents,” he said.
 
 J S Gogia, general secretary of Foswac and Sector-35 RWA, said the federation had raised the issue in the past also but still there weer complaints from various RWAs and so the municipal corporation would be approached again.
