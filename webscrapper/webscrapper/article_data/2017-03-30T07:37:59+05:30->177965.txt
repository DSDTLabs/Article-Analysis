PUNE: Budgets at home will have to be tweaked in April and more money set aside for vegetables as their prices are going to shoot up, some double of what they are now.

 Potatoes and onions, the staple in many kitchens, will be spared the surge. The average spike in prices could be between 20 and 35%, and as much as 100% as in the case of carrots.
 
 Market watchers and essential commodities' traders said the extreme heat conditions the state and the areas around it are experiencing now will impact the general annual supply cycles of vegetables affecting Pune and Mumbai.
 
 Other regular vegetables like cucumber, green chillies, ginger and the gourds will be costlier. Buyers may have to pay an extra Rs 10 per kg in the wholesale market for beans and bitter gourd.
 
 A drop in supply is responsible for a peaking of prices,  , chief business officer of RMLAgTech, an   working with farmers and traders, said.
 
 “As temperatures rise and water supply drops, the variety and yield goes down, and production cycles lengthen. Perishability of vegetables is also more in summer. Farmers have to get water through tankers and factor in this cost to the overall sales. Such a double-whammy spikes market prices almost every year. The trend will continue till June till the rain arrives,“ he added.
 
 Supply may drop by 50% in April, said Anna Gule, incharge of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee in Pune. Vegetable whole saler and trader   said there was a drop in supply because of the heat.
 
 “The quantity of vegetables coming in have started reducing by about 15-25%. It's going to get worse as the heat and  . Green leafy vegetables will be particularly hit,“ he added.
 
 Weekly vegetable markets across the city are also likely to be affected as farmers who grow them in the surrounding areas and bring them to Pune's markets may incur extra costs due to the heat and falling water tables in summer.
