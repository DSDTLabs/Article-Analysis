KOLKATA: Owners of the five  , identified for demolition, on the   project route are waiting to meet the   municipal commissioner within the next two or three days to understand when they must move out so that the state can handover the land to   (RVNL).

 
  reported on October 22, 2016 buildings at   in the way of the Metro route will be demolished. On Friday,the land acquisition department under district magistrate of North 24 Parganas pasted notices on three of the buildings — naming five structures. It asked the building owners to meet the commissioner with their documents.
 
 “It is hereby communicated to rightful claimants to approach the municipal commissioner, within March 28 along with proof of their claim to seek compensation for the said structures,” read the notice. Thus, the land, on which the buildings exist belongs to the state government, which plans to hand it over to RVNL.
 
 Sukumar Mondal, a shop owner in one of the buildings, told 
 : “I tried to meet the commissioner, but was told to submit ownership proof in the Trinamool party office.”
 
 Local councilor   said, “The notice doesn’t talk about eviction. Let the owners submit their documents to the commissioner. Only then we’ll know about the date of demolition and land handover.”
 
 Asked when the demolition will take place, Bidhannagar mayor Sabyasachi Dutta said, “I don’t know. It’s up to the DM.” A spokesperson from the DM’s office, however, said, “Please ask the mayor, who is handling the eviction and demolition. Our job ends at issuing the notification.”
 
 But Dutta insisted, “The notice is from the land acquisition department of the district collector. If asked to execute the demolition, we’ll do it.” He added, “The occupants can’t go on buying time. They built the structures illegally with panchayat’s clearance.” The area was under the Mahisgote panchayat when the buildings came up and later upgraded and included in Bidhannagar.
