BENGALURU: As many as 108   have survived in their new homes after Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) transplanted them. The trees, which were relocated to facilitate construction of   connecting Byappanahalli with ITPL, were planted at Sri Sathya Sai Hospital in Whitefield.

 
 Vijay Nishanth, an urban conservator who took the initiative and convinced BMRCL to transplant the trees, faced multiple challenges. First, he had to convince BBMP to grant permission for transplantation of the trees. Once he secured the nod, the challenge was to find a suitable place.
 
 “We tried contacting multiple corporates in the area but all of them turned us down claiming that they didn’t have the resources or space,” Nishanth said, adding that the hospital finally agreed to house the trees about six months ago. The trees belonging to four families — thongam, behandi, ficus and mango — have adapted to the new place.
 
 DC Sundresh, dean at the hospital, said the facility which provides free treatment to thousands of patients every day can definitely take care of 100 trees. “At first, people were a little hesitant about transplanting the trees as the process is very expensive. It took approximately threeand-a-half hours to transplant each tree. BBMP did not cooperate and delayed the permission,” he said.
