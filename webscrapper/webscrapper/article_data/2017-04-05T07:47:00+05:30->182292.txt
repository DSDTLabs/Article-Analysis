GHAZIABAD: An   from   was arrested on NH-24 in Ghaziabad’s Vijay Nagar area on Monday afternoon. The 49-year-old is accused of trading in illegal arms and, according to police, was here to deliver weapons to a client in Greater Noida.

  police also said they had recovered a dozen 0.32-bore pistols and 11 magazines from  , who cops have been watching since last year when he was booked in Muzaffarnagar under the Arms Act and arrested. He later got bail. His son Abdul Quadir is in jail for the same crime.
 
 Ghaziabad SSP Deepak Kumar, whose previous posting was, incidentally, in Muzaffarnagar, said Tahir was a frequent traveller to Bihar’s Munger, which is notorious for its illegal gun factories. “He has confessed that he goes to   regularly to fetch pistols in bulk, which are then transported by train, private vehicles and even public transport,” Kumar said. 
 
 “We received a tip-off that Tahir would be travelling to Ghaziabad to deliver a cache of arms to a client in Greater Noida,” he added.
 
 He was nabbed while trying to board an auto. On Tuesday, the cops brought Hasan with them to a press conference at Police Lines, where he even answered questions from the media. To one question from this correspondent on the charges against him, Hasan said, “I do it for money and in the last four years I have sold 500   to clients in Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Ghaziabad and Noida. For every pistol sold, I get Rs 2,000. I procure the pistols from Munger.”
