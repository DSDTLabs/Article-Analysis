NEW DELHI:   chief Amit   has appointed a four-member team of senior party functionaries and Union ministers to oversee the party’s campaign in the upcoming municipal elections.

  MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, who is BJP’s national vice-president, minister of state (MoS) commerce Nirmala Sitharaman, MoS water resources Sanjeev Balyan and MoS PMO Jitender Singh have been given the responsibility. Sitharaman, BJP members said, will be looking after media campaigns and management. BJP members said the team will help the state leadership in selecting candidates, planning election campaigns and keeping a check on local friction.
 
 Sources said the present Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari is new to the organisation’s functioning. However, others said friction between some top party members is one of the reasons for the appointment of this team.
 
 “BJP takes every election very seriously and we fight to win. It’s a crucial poll. It’s a cosmopolitan city and so a team comprising functionaries from different states has been formed. We will decisively show that Delhi rejects anarchy and dynasty,” said Sahasrabuddhe. 
 
 BJP’s recent decision to not give tickets to sitting councillors and their relatives has not gone down well with many in the party. Party members said there are high chances that some councillors will either contest independently or field their relatives as independent candidates. “There is a need to check that people don’t work against the party,” said a senior BJP member.
