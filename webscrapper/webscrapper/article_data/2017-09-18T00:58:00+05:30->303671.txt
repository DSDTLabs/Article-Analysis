Coimbatore: The rear wind shield of a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus was damaged after a miscreant threw a stone on Sunday morning. 

 The bus was on its way to Coimbatore from Salem carrying about 30 passengers when the incident happened, police sources said. “When it reached Neelambur around 3.25am, someone threw a stone at the bus, damaging the rear glass window. Though driver S Kamaraj and conductor T Karthikeyan searched for the miscreant, they found no one in the area. Kamaraj immediately informed Sulur police, who reached the spot and conducted a search in the area. Though the driver has not lodged a police complaint, rural police have formed a team to nab the culprit,” a police officer said.
 
 No one was injured in the incident. The bus was later parked at the TNSTC Uppilipalayam branch office.
