 Considering that besides civic officials, local policemen also come to know about unauthorised constructions and encroachments, there will also be a provision to act against such enforcement officials. Government sources said the erring officials will be booked for abetment to corruption for failing to stop illegal and unauthorised constructions. 
 
 Even architects, who prepare and certify the building plan, will be held responsible if the prescribed norms are violated. The revised Unified Building Bye-laws for Delhi holds structural engineers and architects responsible for violations. They can also be booked for their negligence. 
 
 “As we have informed the Supreme Court there will be a mobile app for people to report violations. Actions will be initiated against erring officials and they will be booked,” said a source privy to the government road map to rein in such officials.
 
 He said that the Special Task Force, set up under the Supreme Court’s direction, will have a say in the suspension of erring officials.
 
 Abetment to corruption attracts minimum six months’ jail, which may extend up to five years. Moreover, the guilty will be liable for fine. “There have been cases in the past when senior DDA officials were suspended for their failure to stop illegal construction and violation of Master Plan provisions. This can be a major deterrent. Since the government has submitted this to the Supreme Court there will no escape for officials,” said A K Jain, former DDA commissioner (Planning).
