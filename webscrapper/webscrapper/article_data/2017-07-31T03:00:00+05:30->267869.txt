Nagpur: Death of a 49-year-old labourer triggered tension at Katol rural hospital on Sunday morning after relatives of the deceased staged protests alleging that the patient was denied treatment by medical officer Dr Prashant Meshram.  Katol police deployed security at the hospital after the relatives started creating ruckus. Deputy director (Heath) Dr Sanjay Jaiswal too rushed to the hospital. District Civil Surgeon (CS) Dr Umesh Navade is investigating the case and will be submitting a report to the health department. Former minister Anil Deshmukh, his son Salil and their supporters too visited the hospital and demanded departmental and police action against the doctor. The deceased, Pandurang Mohije, was first taken to the rural hospital on Saturday. As per relatives, the doctor at the rural hospital referred Mohije to Government Medical College and Hospital.  The relatives then took Mohije to a private hospital which referred him to GMCH. As per a relative, Mohije was again taken to the rural hospital in the wee hours of Sunday as they had no money to treat him at GMCH.  Navade said the relatives claimed Meshram called for 108 emergency services to take Mohije to the nearest hospital after they expressed their inability to bear the expenses at GMCH. “Before the ambulance could arrive Mohije passed away at 8am,” he said. Navade added, “As per the statement given by the hospital, Mohije was not referred to GMCH. Instead relatives were told to admit the patient at the rural hospital itself. As per hospital, by the time Mohije was brought back to RH in the morning, his situation had worsened and he had to be referred to another hospital hence 108 was called.” Post-mortem was performed under police security by doctors summoned from Nagpur. A case of accidental death has been registered at Katol police station.
