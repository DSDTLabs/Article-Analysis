To ensure residents of island city and western suburbs are not inconvenienced during construction of   station on Colaba-Seepz   network,   has decided not to divert the five water supply pipes that run underground at the spot where the station will come up. Instead, it has come up with an innovative solution: a truss bridge will be erected underground to hold and support the five pipelines Metro work happens below. 

 Sahar Road station is an underground metro station to be constructed by bottom up method. The truss bridge will hold the pipes till the excavation is completed and roof slab built till the bottom of the utility pipe after backfilling.
 
 The work is challenging because of the lack of space and also since it is the deepest stations with 29 metres of excavation. 
 
 MMRC’s director (projects) SK Gupta said, “Usually, we divert the pipes in case it comes in the way of the station. However, diverting these many pipes wasn’t technically feasible.” 
 
 First, there is no space on one of the station because of the presence of civil structure. The diversion on the other end of the station is not possible because it would have meant providing a bent in the pipes to route it through other side of the station. 
 
 Gupta said, “This is not feasible because a sharp bend would lead to lowering of pressure thus affecting large sections of the population. Secondly, we may have had to stop water supply for a few days in case we decide to diver the pipes. Even this is not feasible idea.”
 
 He added, “These are major civic utilities and not at all possible to divert them out the station areas. The truss bridge will hold the pipes. Once the work is done, the area will be restored and road surfaced, thus ensuring smooth flow of vehicles. It is one of its kind solution and not attempted before at such a scale.”
