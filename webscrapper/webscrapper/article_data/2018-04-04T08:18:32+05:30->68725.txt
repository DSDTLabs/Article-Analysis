HYDERABAD: An investigation into the mysterious rape case of a 15-year-old girl, daughter of a defence employee, took a new turn on Tuesday with the   fingerprinting test revealing that the DNA of none of the three suspects matched with that of the rapist, after they were compared with the semen samples found on the victim’s body.

 With the DNA fingerprinting not nailing any of the suspects, the mystery has further deepened. The victim is a Class X student who was raped by an unidentified person in   of   on December 21, 2017, when she was on the way to her friend’s house.
 
 Sources in City police told TOI that, “DNA fingerprinting test has confirmed the rape and presence of male DNA from the samples collected from the victim. We had sent the blood samples of three suspects that were collected by FSL experts. They compared the suspects’ DNA with that of the DNA profile of the unidentified rapist found on the body and those did not match.”
 
 Investigations had revealed that the accused had thrashed the girl with a stick when she resisted the sexual assault, and she had to be hospitalised. In her statement to the police, the girl said that the man who had raped her was fair, more than 5.5 feet tall and well-built.
 
 Trimulgherry inspector   said, “We had sent the blood samples of the three suspects, including   personnel and civilians, and are awaiting an official report from the FSL. We are yet to arrest the accused.”
 
 According to the police, on the evening of December 21last year, the girl left her house in Ammuguda to meet a friend at Asha Officers’ Colony nearby.
 
 Police said that a stranger waylaid her at Ammuguda railway crossing, dragged her into the bushes and raped her. A local, who was passing by, found her unconscious and informed the family by collecting their contact number from her later.
