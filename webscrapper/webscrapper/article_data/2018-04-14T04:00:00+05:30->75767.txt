Rajkot: Rajkot city will soon get a   and a Science Museum. State government’s department of science and technology has decided to build the Science City at Ishwariya Park on 10 acre land. It will be built in line with Ahmedabad. However, the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) claimed that this would be more sophisticated than Ahmedabad.

 The state government has allocated Rs 78 crore for the project that will be completed within 15 months. Once the project is completed, RMC will take over operation and maintenance.
 
 RMC commissioner Banchha Nidhi Pani said, “There will be robotics gallery, Nobel Prize gallery, physics gallery, I-Max theatre, life sciences and entertainment zone for kids and many other things.”
 
 Rajkot mayor Jaiman Upadhyay said, “The science city will be a big attraction not only for children, but for elders too. This will be an important place for tourists who come to Rajkot.”
