THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Clad in a white shabby cotton shirt and with unkempt hair,   stood beside his paintings, trying hard to explain about his works in broken sentences. Each painting is a product of the hardwork and sheer dedication of this man, whose hands would be smeared with colours in the mornings, and soiled with left-over food by noon. Kunissery saved around Rs 2000 every month for the past 18 months, by working as a cleaner at a private restaurant, for raising fund and buying canvas and colours.

 His   at the   titled ‘Sthree’ ( )—which has 30 paintings about the willpower and vigour of women—also tells the story of the struggle of a sixteen-year-old boy who was shooed away from home by his drunkard father. 
 
 “I grew up watching the chaos and ruckus crated by my father and in-laws at home. I had to discontinue my studies and leave home, and since then I worked as cleaner at different restaurants to earn a living,” he recalls.
 
 Here, each of the paintings reflects the strength and determination of his mother and two sisters who braved all odds and struggled through life, never to give up. “Their inner strength inspired me to depict them on canvas. Women hold the central theme,’’ he adds.
 
 An abstract painting of wooden hue speaks about a meditating woman, he says, while the works with misty mountains and fields suggest the subtle and strong emotions of women. For Kunissery, women and nature are one. However, his favourite work is one which features a butterfly. “Butterflies live only for a short period but they are very colourful and radiate happiness around them. We tend to smile and turn happy just by watching them. I think all of us should be like that,’’ said Sunil.
 
 The exhibition will be open to the public from 10 am to 7 pm till Tuesday.
