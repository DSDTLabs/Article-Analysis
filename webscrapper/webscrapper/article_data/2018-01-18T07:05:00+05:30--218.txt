Ludhiana: The D Zone office of the MC on Wednesday, was the venue of a high-level drama when civic officials and two media persons from a news channel entered into a tiff. Following the tiff, several media persons from various channels gathered at the D zone office and sat on protest against MC officials while demanding an FIR against ATP SS Bindra. Cops reached the D zone office after which both the groups gave their statements to the police. One of the media persons, Hardeep Arora was admitted to the civil hospital after he complained of chest pain. Members of his fraternity alleged he suffered a heart attack. 

 The media persons alleged they were manhandled by the MC staff and even their video cameras were snatched. On the other hand, the building branch officials alleged the scribes entered the office of the assistant town planner (ATP) without permission and used abusive language when they were stopped.
 
 It was at around 12.15 pm when the two media persons went to the office of ATP Surinder Singh Bindra who was attending to public grievances and a few ex councillors. Bindra said that the duo after entering his office put the camera on and continued even after being asked not to. He said when he asked the staff to get them out of the office they used expletives and ran away leaving their mobile phones and camera outside the office. 
 
 On the other hand, cameraman Arora, alleged Bindra asked his staff to beat and throw them out of the MC office. He alleged they were manhandled by the MC staff badly and their mobile along with camera were snatched by the officials. 
 
 Meanwhile the zonal commissioner Kulpreet Singh and other MC officials tried to convince the protesting media to lift their dharna but they did not budge. But media persons rushed to the civil hospital where Arora was admitted.
