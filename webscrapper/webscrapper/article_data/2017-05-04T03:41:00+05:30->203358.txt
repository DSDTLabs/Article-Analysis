Panaji: Students and faculty of the three-year diploma course in drama at Kala Academy will be staging 11 shows of Pundalik Naik’s ‘Chaitanyak Math Na’ (Energy Cannot be Bound) at several locations in the hinterlands of the state in an attempt to increase awareness about the course which has seen a decrease in takers over the past few years, and encourage residents in these parts to sign up for it. 

 “The play’s plot revolves around a village hence, the people we are attempting to reach out to will identify with the characters and the setting,” said Avinash Chari, the director of the play which is set to be staged in Ponda, Moira, Sanquelim, Loliem, Ashwem, Anjuna and Divar among other places.
 
 “The play speaks about expressing one’s energy and enthusiasm and harnessing it in a positive manner. This makes it perfect for us to create awareness about the course,” said Padmashree Josalkar, director at Kala Academy School of Drama.
 
 The play, which started as a classroom exercise, led to a dramatic expression of sorts of the students. This urged them to take the play into the hinterlands and share the magic of drama and the beauty of expression through acting.
 
 “We usually have the comfort of performing on stage. This activity brought us out of the comfort zone as we are performing in open spaces with limited technical support,” said one of the student actors, Ackyshma Fernandes.
