CHANDIGARH: The Punjab finance department has raised objection over implementation of the pre-poll promises listed in the   manifesto including that of providing houses to houseless rural and urban poor whose annual income is less than Rs 5 lakh.

 Raising the red flag, the department has said it would be inappropriate to implement the   and other such poll promises with the existing criteria as those with an annual income of Rs 5 lakh are income tax payees and thus cannot be considered poor.
 
 As per the budget 2018-19, people with an annual income of less than Rs 2.50 lakh are exempted from paying income tax. Those earning above Rs 2.50 lakh and up to Rs 5 lakh have to pay 5% tax on the total income over Rs 2.50 lakh and also 4% cess.
 
 Resultantly, the department of rural development and panchayats has decided to put up the issue before the council of ministers for deliberations. The agenda would now come up in the next cabinet meeting scheduled on May 30 for decision whether the annual income limit needs to be reduced in the eligibility criteria. Under the scheme, the department of rural development and panchayats would be pay Rs 1.20 lakh for the construction of dwelling units to poor houseless people.
 
 A senior officer, not willing to be named, said, “Since the   has promised in its manifesto, its government would be implementing the scheme. However, it would be an advantage for the cash-strapped state government if the income limit is reduced from Rs 5 lakh as it would also reduce the number of eligible persons.”
 
 In the run-up to the 2017 Punjab assembly elections, the Congress had promised in its poll manifesto to introduce Mukhmantri Awas Yojana to provide free residential houses to houseless rural and urban poor. The manifesto also promised free built up houses or 5 marla plots to all homeless scheduled caste families and families of Muslims and Christians with an annual income of less than Rs 5 lakh.
