PATNA: Despite frequent eviction drives by the   ( ), encroachment on city roads remains a perennial problem, leading to traffic congestion.

 According to a PMC official, the civic body carries out its anti-encroachment drive on at least 200 days in a year. “At most places, the vendors run away during the drive, but return soon after the PMC team leaves. Stopping them from coming back is the duty of the local police,” the official said, adding an estimated Rs 1.5 lakh was spent in carrying out the drive for a day.
 
 Sources claimed that the Patna high court, which had directed the PMC to remove encroachments from time-to-time, also told police to ensure that the encroachers did not return. Around 30 PMC staff equipped with earthmover machines carry out the anti-encroachment drive in different localities under the supervision of police, a magistrate level officer, an executive officer and a city manager.
 
 Be it Boring Road, Bailey Road, Sabzibagh, Khetan Market area, Bari Path or Kankerbagh, the eviction drive has been carried out umpteen times in these localities, yet they remain occupied by makeshift stalls or small shops.
 
 In fact, encroachers have started occupying parking lots as well. The parking area on the road leading towards Rajapur Pul is used either by roadside eateries or second-hand car dealers.
 
 Officials blame it on the agencies which got the tender for ensuring proper usage of parking lots. “We lack strength and gave the contract to private agencies, but with certain terms and conditions which they usually violate. In order to earn extra bucks, these agencies allow roadside eateries to us parking areas for their business,” the PMC official said.
