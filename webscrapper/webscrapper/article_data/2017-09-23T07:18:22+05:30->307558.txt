PUNE: Over the past six months,   (23) had nearly made it a habit of breaking the lock of any two-wheeler and riding away instead of travelling by a public transport vehicle. 

 His luck finally ran out on Thursday when the police caught him with a stolen motorcycle. Police have also detained his minor accomplice.
 
 Sub-inspector Shivdas Gaikwad of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said that Parkhe was taken into custody outside a restaurant at Katraj Ghat section. “When we stopped and asked him to furnish the motorcycle’s document, he provided vague answers before admitting that he had stolen the bike from Katraj. He also admitted that he had stolen other bikes with the help of an accomplice,” Gaikwad said.
 
 The police have recovered eight motorcycles and an autorickshaw, worth Rs3.1 lakh. “Parkhe has a previous criminal record. He was released on bail barely six months ago,” Gaikwad said. Almost immediately after his release from jail, Parkhe had started stealing vehicles. “He would use duplicate keys or break the handle lock to steal the vehicle. A number of times he stole bikes just to get home,” the officer added.
 
 In another case, Bharati Vidyapeeth police arrested two suspects, detained a minor, and recovered three stolen motorcycles, a laptop and a cellphone worth Rs87,000.
