  ‘Krishnarjuna Yuddham’ charted the journey of Krishna, a lungi-clad simpleton from a village in Chitoor and his lookalike Arjun, a rock star from Prague. When Krishna and Arjun’s lady loves, played by Anupama Parameswaran and debutant  , are abducted, the two come together under trying circumstances to save them from being sold into the flesh trade. While the film was one that was much-awaited, it failed to leave an impression on the audience, despite Nani justifying how the film was unique in his interviews. 
 
  The theatrical rights were reportedly sold for a whopping Rs 30 Cr, with the film collecting only Rs 14.79 Cr worldwide.
