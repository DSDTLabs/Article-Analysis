VIJAYWADA: India A bowlers continued to torment New Zealand A batsmen, dismissing the visitors for a meagre 211 on the first day of the second 'unofficial' Test, on Saturday.

 India A were 33 for 1 at stumps. Although it's a day match as the stadium doesn't have floodlights, pink ball is being used on an experimental basis.
 
 Opting to bat, New Zealand did a shade better than the first 'Test' where they failed to cross the 150 in both innings.
 
 The only significant partnership was the fourth wicket-stand of 82 runs between former KKR left-hander   (65) and opener Jeet Raval (48).
 
 In the lower order, keeper-batsman Tim Seifert (44 no) showed some stomach for fight with as many as six batsmen unable to reach double figures.
 
 Pacer   (3/34) blew away the top-order while leg-spinner Karn Sharma (3/49 in 16.5 overs) and left-arm spinner   (2/41 in 15 overs) ran through the middle and lower order.
 
 Veteran keeper   was summoned to play this game after   was laid low with fever.
 
 Pant has been pulled out from the game on a precautionary basis as he is likely to get selected for the three-match T20 series.
 
 
  New Zealand 1st Innings 211 (Colin Munro 65, Jeet Raval 48, Tim Seifert 44, Shardul Thakur 3/34, Karn Sharma 3/49, Shahbaz Nadeem 2/41).
 
 India 1st Innings 33/1 (Shreyas Iyer 18 batting, Priyank Panchal 14 batting).
