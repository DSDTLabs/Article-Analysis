CHANDIGARH: Your mobile phones, which are a major cause of   -a hearing problem, where noise is perceived in the absence of sound -can be used as a therapy for treatment.In an effort to make the treatment cost effective,   had started using mobile phones instead of portable noise maskers costing anywhere between Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000 for the ear disorder, As a follow up after six months, it was found that out of 30 patients subjected to mobile phones as noise maskers, 60% could be treated. The study has been published recently in the Indian Journal of  .

 A total of 30 male patients with tinnitus were enrolled for therapy at the  . “We see around 10 patients suffering from tinnitus daily. Using costlier noise maskers for sound treatment is not a viable option for most pa tients," said Dr Sanjay Munjal, the first author of the study. ENT doctors felt that most of the patients do not come for the conventional 10-15 days' therapy as it turns out to be costly travelling from states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. As the mobile phone is a widely used gadget, noise maskers were created from the audiometer --a device which is used to assess the level of tinnitus -in the hospital.
 
 This noise varied from narrow to broad band width depending on the level of frequency of sound heard by the patient suffering with tinnitus. “So, for instance, a tinnitus patient has a perception of say 8000 hertz (unit of sound frequency), a noise of the same frequency from the audiometer is created. This noise is recorded and downloaded to be shared with the mobile phone of the patient. The sound is converted into  ," said Dr Noorain Alam, investigator of the PGI study. This masker works as a distractor.There's follow-up every month," said Dr Alam.
