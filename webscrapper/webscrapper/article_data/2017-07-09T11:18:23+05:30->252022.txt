GUWAHATI: The Kamrup (Metro) district administration has ordered the   (GMC) to remove all electric hoardings from all major roads in the city. The order comes after the death of several people by electrocution during rain. 

 "I have asked the GMC to not allow the installation of electric hoardings on all major roads - including GS Road, AT Road, RG Baruah Road - and others in and around the city. The existing ones have to be removed at the earliest," said deputy commissioner M Angamuthu.
 
 Angamuthu, who is also the chairperson of the district disaster management authority, said these hoardings are not properly maintained, which can cause more deaths during the rain and floods.
 
 The district administration has also asked the   (APDCL) to inspect all street lights to avoid accidents. The CEO of APDCL and the commissioner of GMC have been asked to carry out an inspection of all electric connections to all street lights in and around the city.
 
 At least three individuals, including a school students, died after being electrocuted during heavy rain and floods in the city last month. Thiry-five people died of electrocution in this manner in 2015, according to a home ministry report. Between 2010 and 2015, 410 people died in the state of electrocution.
 
 City residents and organizations have blamed the APDCL and administration for these deaths. "It's negligence on the part of the APDCL and government agencies for failing to control the deaths. This is happening every year. We demand that strict measures be adopted to stop this," said Ramen Kalita, a senior citizen.
