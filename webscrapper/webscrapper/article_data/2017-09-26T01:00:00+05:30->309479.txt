These days,   is busy juggling movies and judging a devotional music reality show 'Om Shanti Om'. When asked if her taking up the reality show had anything to do with her being religious, she replied, “My mother (  ) is very religious and she has dedicated her life to God and the well-being of her children. I studied in an Arya Samaj school, where we studied Sanskrit and were taught Ramayan and   as well. So, there were many opportunities during my childhood to connect with religion through music and spirituality.” 

 Though spiritual,   maintains that she is not religious and doesn’t frequent temples. So, does she fast during   like many of her colleagues? “Just because other celebs fast during Navratri, I don’t have to,” she says jokingly, adding, “My dad taught me that God is in our hearts and I believe in that. We have a beautiful temple at home and we performed our Navratri puja there. I feel, you don’t need to go to a place of worship to pray — you can simply meditate and feel your connect with God. That is my way of praying. And music, I feel, is another fastest way to connect with the Almighty.”
