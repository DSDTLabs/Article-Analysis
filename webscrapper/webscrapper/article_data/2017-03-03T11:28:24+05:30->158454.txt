IMPHAL/YAIRIPOK: Union home minister   on Thursday promised to make   a model state if the BJP was elected to power. Addressing a rally for BJP candidate Oinam Haridas Singh in Wangkhem constituency of   district, he called on voters to remove   from the state. 

 "Vote for BJP, we will make Manipur a model state," Singh said at the rally in   village under Wangkhem constituency. The seat will vote in the second phase on March 8. This is the second time the home minister has visited Manipur to campaign for the election.
 
 Singh blamed the ruling Congress for rising unemployment in the state. Manipur has seven lakh educated unemployed youths.
 
 Praising the state for its rich culture and for having produced skilled youth, he blamed the Congress government for not doing anything to provide jobs to these youths. "Congress should take responsibility for its failure to create jobs," he said.
 
 The home minister also reiterated BJP's resolve to protect Manipur's territorial integrity. Under attack from Congress and civil society groups on the Naga framework agreement, he charged the ruling party with playing politics on the pact and dividing people.
 
 Singh repeated Prime Minister  's assurance that the framework agreement signed between the Centre and the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) in 2015 did not contain any point that could harm Manipur's boundary.
 
 Singh flew into   from New Delhi on Thursday morning on a special jet plane. From Imphal airport, he boarded a helicopter and first flew to Churachandpur town to campaign for BJP candidate V Hangkhalian. He then went to the Naga-dominated Tamei constituency in Tamenglong district to address an election rally organized by BJP candidate Z Kikhonbou Newmai. He then flew back to Yairipok to address the rally in Wangkhem before flying back to New Delhi.
