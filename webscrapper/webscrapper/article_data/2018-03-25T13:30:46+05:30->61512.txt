NAGPUR: Several villagers in Maoist-affected south   destroyed the Reds’ banners put up to announce their ‘Bandi chodo saptah’ or ‘Release political prisoners week’ being observed between March 23 and 29, near   on the road connecting   and Alapalli on Saturday. 

 Around 50-100 villagers from Oranda and neighbouring hamlets joined hands to set three   banners on fire and held the   responsible for stalling development in the tribal district for the last five decades. The tribals also vowed not to extend any kinds of logistics or other support to the Maoists. 
 
 The villagers claimed the Reds have crippled their socio-economic growth apart from paralysing infrastructure and education in the district. They stated that henceforth they will support the district administration and government agencies for development in their backward district. 
 
 Last week, the villagers had brought down several Maoist memorials erected for commemorating the martyrdom of their guerilla cadres in police encounters. In the past, the villagers from north Gadchiroli too had burnt banners and pamphlets of the Maoists.
