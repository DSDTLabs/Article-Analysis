NEW DELHI:   and education minister   spoke about the   of the capital at   on Sunday, and said that Delhi’s   can be followed by the entire country. 

 During his keynote address at the annual India Conference in Harvard University, the minister revisited development in the education sector in the capital ever since the AAP government came to power. He gave example of how school infrastructure has changed in the last two years — both in terms of aesthetics and functionality.
 
 “In the first year we concentrated on improving the infrastructure of schools. Delhi government schools now have smart classrooms, clean and modern washrooms, air-conditioned assembly halls, and some even have swimming pools and athletic tracks. Many schools were given such facelifts. We have also built 8000 new classrooms and 10000 more are in various stages of completion,” he told an audience of scholars, businessmen and journalists.
 
 He also spoke about the government’s move to bring parents closer to education system through SMCs and mega PTMs, and the push for better training to its administrators and principals through a number of exposure trips.
 
 He added that currently, high caliber officials stands around 5% of the population created by premier institutes in the country, while “for the rest of the 95%, the system has completely collapsed”.
 
 “The country’s development depends on the quality of its human resource, its people; and the quality of the human resource depends on their access to high-quality education and healthcare. Delhi’s governance model addresses this fundamental need,” he said.
