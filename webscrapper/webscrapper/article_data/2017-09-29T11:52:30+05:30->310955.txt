CHENNAI: The DMK and the   joined the chorus in questioning the stateover its decision to depute information and publicity minister Kadambur Raju and fisheries minister D   to inaugurate the late actor   Ganesan’s memorial in Chennai on October 1.

 It would be a fitting honour for the late actor only if the chief minister  , along with the deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, were present at the inaugural, they said. 
 
 Actor and DMK party legislator Vaagai Chandrasekhar while questioning the government, called upon Tamil film stars to make it clear that the industry would boycott the event if the CM is not present for the inauguration. He also recalled that an earlier the DMK had installed a statue of the actor on Kamarajar Salai, and the then chief minister M Karunanidhi had unveiled it. The   government had not only removed the statue, but was now showing disrespect by deputing two ministers to inaugurate the memorial, Chandrasekhar said in a statement on Thursday.
 
  Congress Committee (TNCC) president, S Thirunavukarasar urged the state to join hands with the South Indian Artistes’ Association (SIAA) for the opening of the memorial in a grand manner. TN chief minister, senior actors, besides Sivaji Ganesan’s family members should be part of the function, he said.
 
 When Sivaji Ganesan was bestowed with the Chevalier award, former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had organised a grand function. It is only becoming that the leaders today too honour the star in an appropriate way, Thirunavukarasar added.Minister Jayakumar had clarified that the CM and deputy CM are not in the city on October 1, hence the present arrangement.
