Parents are used to situations wherein their children do not respond to requests to showcase their talent in the presence of a relative or a friend. Children tend to get self-conscious in company and therefore exhibit so called “performance anxiety” when asked to sing or dance at the behest of a relative. Adults experience similar anxiety when they visit a doctor and this is evident in the higher   (BP) readings than normal at the doctor’s office, in a phenomenon called “white coat hypertension”. The opposite of this is “masked hypertension”, which indicates elevated BP in adults with otherwise normal BP readings. Unfortunately, this condition goes largely unnoticed unless ambulatory or 24-hour BP readings are taken. This procedure involves the patient being connected to the BP cuff, which measures BP at regular intervals while the patient is going about his or her day.

 Doctors believe that ambulatory BP is generally lower than the single reading performed at the doctor’s office, due to the anxiety experienced by a patient. A recent study has challenged this belief and demonstrated that 15.7% of subjects with normal BP readings had higher ambulatory BP, indicating masked hypertension. Study participants had to visit the clinic three times, and their BP was measured at each visit. In addition, they had ambulatory BP readings taken every 30 minutes during a 24-hour period. Results revealed that younger subjects and those within normal weight ranges were more likely to have higher ambulatory BP readings, than older or overweight subjects. These results suggest that when there is reason to suspect   which is not substantiated with elevated BP readings at the doctor’s office, it may be wise to dig deeper and evaluate ambulatory BP, which is a better indicator of heart disease. When detected in time, hypertension can be managed through lifestyle changes and medication thus allowing the patient to live a longer and healthier life.
