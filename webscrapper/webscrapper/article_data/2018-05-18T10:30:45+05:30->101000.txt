KOCHI: The cleaning of Mullassery canal undertaken at the behest of Metroman E   could reduce waterlogging on MG Road and the central business district (CBD) areas to a great extent. The work which started almost three weeks ago would be over in a weeks’ time.

 
 According to mayor Soumini Jain, the cleaning work is almost over. What is remaining is the installation of a high-power pump to flush out water from the canal during heavy rains. “The DMRC officials carrying out the work are now dismantling Pettiyum Parayum (a mechanism which had been installed in four points in the canal for regulating water level during ebb and flow) as it has become defunct. It will take a few more days to install the high-power pump,” Soumini Jain said.
 
  (FRNV) led by   is funding the project. K Chittilappilly Foundation floated by Kochouseph Chittilappilly had given Rs 10 lakh for the project, personally monitored by E Sreedharan.
 
 Mayor said that Sreedharan has suggested connecting Vivekananda canal to backwaters near   cia a another canal. “An agency called   had conducted a study to solve waterlogging in the city a few years ago. On the basis of it, Esteem Developers prepared a detailed project report. One of the components in the project was desilting Mullassery canal,” Soumini Jain said.
 
 Vivekananda canal joins Thevara-Perandoor canal through a railway culvert near KSRTC bus station. As the culvert cross railway line, a pipe has been laid strengthening the culvert, she said. “But the pipe is too narrow and affects the flow. When water reaches Perandoor canal the nearby P&T colony and   colony would be inundated. If the proposal is implemented, it would help resolve waterlogging in these area also,” she said.
