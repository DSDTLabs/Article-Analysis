HYDERABAD: A group of 169 volunteers got together to clean the   near   village on Saturday. Volunteers from the Dhruvansh organisation along with students from nearby engineering colleges and officials of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) were part of the cleaning mission, initiated to revive the lake.

 The lake, which is spread over 77 acres, has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and a serious cause for concern for residents living in the surrounding areas. Though the lake falls under both the   (HMDA) and the   (GHMC) purview, no efforts were made to clean it by either of the authorities. “As nothing was happening for the last one year, we decided to clean it ourselves” said  , a member of Dhruvansh.
 
 Funds for the drive were organised through donations collected from local neighbourhoods and other donors. The organisation had previously revived a part of the Ibrahimbagh Chinnacheruvu lake and turned the sewage into fresh water.
