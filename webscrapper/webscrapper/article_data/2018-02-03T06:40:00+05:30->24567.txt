KOLKATA: BJP on Friday questioned the Election Commission’s role in ensuring a “level playing field” in the  . 

 BJP leader Mukul Roy cited several instances in Bagnan and   in which the party — which has got 2.93 lakh votes in this   seat — got less than 10 votes in polling booths while   got over 750. “How is this possible? We would like to pat EC for ensuring such a free and fair poll,” Roy told reporters, sarcasm evident in his voice.
 
 BJP’s anger isn’t without reason. The party, which has been demanding additional central forces for the polls, had to be content with only 18 companies of CAPF. Its candidate Anupam   alleged: “BJP has emerged as a winner in nearly 400 booths. These booths, incidentally, were manned by central forces or patrolled by them. If we had adequate central forces, the result could have been very different. I have written to my party state and central leadership that these 400 booths can help us win at least two panchayat samitis. But the ruling party has reduced elections to a farce. Unless online nominations are allowed, I suspect we can’t do any better.” 
 
 Roy, who later spoke to reporters alongside Mullick, said: “Democracy has been butchered in Bengal. We will submit a complete report not only to the party leadership but also to EC. We will demonstrate before EC. In Udaynarayanpur, Uluberia and Bagnan, some places showed a trend reverse to the 2014 election results. Yet, there has been an overall vote surge. Have all our supporters vanished overnight? The data we have collated is sufficient to prove Trinamool Congress’ lead is false.” 
 
 Denying that he hasn’t been able to affect the poll results, Roy said: “Mamata Banerjee in the run-up to 2011 assembly polls had been vocal about rigging. She had herself used booth data in which her party had single-digit figures to show how votes were being manipulated. Today her party is gaining from the same formula. This says it all.”
