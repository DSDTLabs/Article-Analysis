GHAZIABAD: Two men were arrested on Tuesday for sexually harassing a 27-year-old play school owner in  . The accused — the   of a local   functionary, and a banquet hall owner’s son — were produced in a city court that sent them to judicial custody for 14 days.

 The   came a day after an FIR was lodged at Kavi Nagar police station based on the woman’s complaint against the duo.
 
 In her complaint, the woman, who runs a play school in Indirapuram and also owns a beauty parlour in Crossings Republik, alleged that the accused befriended her on social media and soon started sending her sexually explicit messages.
 
 “When I objected to their misconduct, they threatened to abduct me from home and also threw acid on my face. The duo has been mentally harassing me for a long time. I am facing threat to life from them. I will be left with no option but to commit suicide if no action is taken against them,” she told police.
 
 Talking to TOI, the woman said, “One of them was my classmate 12 years back, although we were not friends. Four years back, he sent me a   request on Facebook which I accepted. Many a times, he used to send me messages asking to meet him. A few months back, I gave him an ultimatum that if he continued with this behaviour, I would lodge a police complaint. He asked his friend to harass me.”
 
 “Both sent me many sexually explicit messages. Some eight days back, the other man blocked my path near Hapur Chungi and misbehaved with me. He also threatened to abduct me and throw acid on my face. Later, he sent me obscene messages. I lodged a complaint with the woman helpline number 1090 on Sunday. An FIR was lodged at Kavi Nagar police station on Monday evening,” she added.
 
 SHO of Kavi Nagar police station Samarjeet Singh said, “An FIR under sections 354 (sexual  ) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and Section 67 (transmitting sexually explicit material) of the IT Act has been lodged against the accused.”
