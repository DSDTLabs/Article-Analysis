NEW DELHI: Soon, robots may be greeting you at airports in the country.   — a   that uses   to assist customers, address their   and entertain them — will soon be used by   at its Delhi airport   lounge from July 5.

 “The robot is aimed at helping the airline offer a seamless experience and an ‘intuitively thoughtful’ on-ground service to its customers. During its initial stage, RADA will assist customers using the lounge before they board their flights. Its functionality and features will be further developed after gauging customer feedback,”   said on Tuesday.
 
 Officials say at present, RADA can scan boarding passes and provide information on departure gates, weather conditions of destination city and real-time flight status.
 
 “It can engage with kids and adults alike by playing games and other multimedia content such as songs and videos too,” the airline said.
 
 Vistara CEO Leslie Thng said: “With RADA, we aim to change the way people interact and fly with an airline. Our steadfast focus remains to be on delighting customers across all touchpoints.”
 
 RADA has been conceived, designed and engineered by a team from Tata Innovation Lab. The “made-in-India” robot is built on a chassis of four wheels, enabling it to rotate 360 degrees, and has three in-built cameras for cognitive interaction.
