NEW DELHI: The government “might” be able to achieve the   of 3% of GDP in 2019-20, a year earlier than the current plan, a top official said on Monday, and also asserted that the expansion in services and   (Purchasing Managers’ Index) points to “good growth pick-up”.

 “Fiscal deficit at 3.3% (of GDP) for 2018-19, backed with statutory commitment to bring it down to 3% by ’20-21 (might actually be achieved in ’19-20) and further supported with a commitment to bring down debt-to-GDP ratio to 40% by 2024-25, is truly strong fiscal consolidation plan,” economic affairs secretary   said on Twitter.
 
 The latest comments from the government on the deficit comes against the backdrop of a more than expected slippage in the 2017-18 target. The government revised the 2017-18   target to 3.5%, higher than 3.2% estimated earlier, on back of lower growth in revenues. The government also revised the glide path of achieving the 3% fiscal deficit target by 2020-21. Fiscal deficit is the difference between the revenue receipts and the total expenditure. It indicates the total borrowing requirements of government from all sources.
 
 Garg also pointed to the two data set on services and manufacturing, which he said signalled robust growth. “Services PMI rose to 51.7% in January, marking impressive improvement in orders. Manufacturing PMI also remains strongly in positive territory at 52.4%....point to good growth pick-up,” Garg said.
 
 Services sector activity posted the fastest growth in three months in January. The Nikkei Services Business Activity Index rose to 51.7 from December’s 50.9. The 50 point mark separates expansion from contraction.
