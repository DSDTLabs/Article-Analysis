KOCHI: Mere pendency of a case is not an obstacle to sell land, the   has held, adding that at most it would make the sale subject to the outcome of the pending case.

 Among rights related to enjoyment of property, the right to sell land is the most important, the court said in the judgment in WP(C) No. 10995/2014. The ruling enables land owners to escape frivolous litigation, often aimed at preventing sale at a higher price, and would leave only serious contenders to fight it out in a civil court.
 
 Considering a petition filed by   in Palakkad, the court said in the judgment, “Mere pendency of any litigation of whatever nature does not ipso facto affect a person's right to alienate. As mandated under section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, a sale, pending any litigation, at best amounts to a lis pendens (case pending) sale. A sale pendente lite (awaiting outcome of litigation) cannot give to the purchaser a cleaner, better title than what the seller has. And the purchaser's right to the property is always subject to the outcome in the pending litigation.” Referring to an earlier judgment of the high court (  vs. State of Kerala), the court said enjoyment of property signifies a bundle of rights, of which the right to alienate is vital.
