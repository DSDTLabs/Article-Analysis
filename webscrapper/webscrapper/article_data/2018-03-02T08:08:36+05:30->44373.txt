TRICHY: Former chief minister   may have lived for another 15 years if she was given appropriate treatment, said state transport minister   at a party meeting in Karur on Thursday. 

 He said that deteriorating health condition of Jayalalithaa was evident even on Independence Day, a month before she was hospitalised in September 2017. Accusing the   family of not providing her better treatment, he said that none of the ministers or partymen were allowed to see her. 
 
 He was addressing a gathering of AIADMK cadres at   in Karur, where the disqualified MLA and former minister,  , had addressed supporters a week ago.
 
 Vijayabhaskar who now holds transport ministry, which was earlier held by Senthil Balaji, accused Senthil of leaving the ministry deep in debt. "The schemes that he now boasts of having introduced during his stint as minister were actually the schemes of Jayalalithaa. He did nothing but left the ministry in debt," he said.
