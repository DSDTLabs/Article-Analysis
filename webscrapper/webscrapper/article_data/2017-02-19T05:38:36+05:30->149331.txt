JAISALMER: A rocket   in an agriculture field near Mohangarh town of Jaisalmer created panic among the villagers on Saturday afternoon. There were no casualties, except for loss of crop.

There was, however, no official confirmation by the army authorities till late Saturday night.

 Defence spokesperson Lt Col Manish Ojha said, today, in a rare incident during practice firing at   firing ranges, a rocket landed in a cultivated field on the outskirts of the range boundary. There was no loss of life or injury to any person. Safety norms are strictly observed by armed forces during field firing. The cause of the rocket over shooting the range boundary is being investigated. This firing as mentioned above was being carried out by Army, he added.
