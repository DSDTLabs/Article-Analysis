Debutant filmmaker Tom Emmatty's Oru Mexican Aparatha very much heralds the resurgence of campus politics-based movies in Mollywood. The director though has made sure that the movie solely doesn't focus on that part, by wrapping it with enough humour, romance and other elements that make campus life fun.

 The movie has   in two roles, with his character Paul being the focus. As an innocent and joyful Thrissurkaaran who has no connection to politics in the first half, Tovino is as cute as he's charming in his role. But it's   as the level-headed Subhash who owns the first half. The actor has indeed brought his A-game for the movie showing off his acting chops. As a young revolutionary who aims to establish a new political student faction in Maharaja College, he portrays the character with a refreshing vigour while   and Roopesh Peethambaram do justice to their parts as well with the latter being a joy to watch and never looking like it's only his second acting venture.
 
 At the halfway stage of the movie, which is 2 hour 23 minutes long, the story is well poised. The movie started off with a flashback scene in 1975 as Kochaniyan brought a new dawn in campus politics only to have the authority stamp down on him and chuff out the revolution. 
 
 The first half slowly builds up the story by focusing more on campus life. And yet by halfway stage, the filmmaker established an emotional connect with the characters of Paul and Subhash, and their journey.
 
 The movie is shot realistically and is replete with real life humour, and the situations too would remind many of life in a college in the 2000s with its cultural festivals and vibrant campus atmosphere. The next half promises more drama and if Subhash and Paul are successful in their journey to bring about a revolution.
