NEW DELHI: Following in the footsteps of south corporation,   has decided to replace over two lakh conventional streetlights with   across its six zones. The civic body has 2.5 lakh streetlights, including semi-high mast and park lights, in its areas. The approval for the project was given by the standing committee on Thursday.

 Not only does the corporation have to pay a hefty Rs 4.5 crore every month as electricity bills, but the conventional lights also add to the carbon footprint. “This is the biggest step towards energy efficiency and making the environment clean,” said standing committee chairman Parvesh Wahi.
 
 A feasibility study has found that LED lighting will result in 64.44% savings in energy consumption. “Every year we pay around Rs 72 crore as electricity bills and maintenance of the streetlights,” said an official.
 
 Officials said that the corporation won’t have to make any initial investment as they have entered into an agreement with a private firm for the project. The private agency will take 79% of the total money saved due to decreased consumption of electricity, while 21% will go into the corporation’s coffers.
 
 “The maintenance will be done by the private firm for seven years without any payment by the corporation,” said an official. The work order for the project will be given in a couple of days and it will have to be completed within nine months.
 
  mayor Sanjeev Nayyar said the project is being undertaken as energy efficiency is the dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 The decision for replacement of the streetlights was taken in 2016, but the proposal did not get the approval of the elected representatives. Now that municipal elections are round the corner, the BJP-led corporation is trying to cash in on this project to woo its voters.
