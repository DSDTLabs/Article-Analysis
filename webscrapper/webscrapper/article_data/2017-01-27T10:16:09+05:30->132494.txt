LUCKNOW: It proved to be a fruitful Republic Day for the Indians at Syed Modi GP Gold   tournament on Thursday. With their top guns,   and  , taking their expected places in the quarterfinals, it was some fine displays by B Sai Praneeth, Sameer Verma and   that put the icing on the cake at the BBD Academy. 

 All three went past foreign players. Top-seeded Sindhu was in full flow against Lalita Dahiya, coming up with some sharp smashes and measured drops to wrap up the verdict 21-7, 21-12 in just 19 minutes. Srikanth, on the other hand, had to brave a spirited fight from Ansal Yadav before sealing the issue 21-15, 21-16.
 
 After Srikanth took the opening set with his trade mark smashes, Yadav tightened up his defense and slowed down the game in the second set. It was a neck-and0-neck issue with Yadav ahead 16-15, but then Srikanth unleashed a flurry of line-hugging smashes to take the next six consecutive points and the match.
 
 Praneeth too displayed a tight defence and better game sense to upset the fifth seed from Denmark - Anders Antonsen - 21-15, 21-10 and Verma kept Malaysia's Wei Feng Chong on the run with his half-smashes and drops to win 21-15, 21-16.
 
 Rituparna Das too came up with a lion-hearted dis play to upset eighth seeded Ksenia Polikarpova 21-12, 2119. The 20-year-old youngster troubled the Russian with her measured drops and some intelligent net play.
 
 Mumbai youngster Harsheel Dani, meanwhile, stunned sixth-seeded HS Prannoy . The 20-year-old left-hander posed a lot of questions to Prannoy with his all-round game to prevail 21-18, 2-18.
 
 But it was curtains for third seeded men's doubles pair of Manu Attri and Sumeeth Reddy. The Indians were laid low Mohamad Arif Abdul Latif and Khim Wah Lim of Malaysia 21-15, 17-21, 21-17 in a lively battle of attrition.
