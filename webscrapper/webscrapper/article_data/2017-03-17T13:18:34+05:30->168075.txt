PANAJI: In order to project Goa as an  , the state government headed by chief minister,   must entrust the   portfolio to a single minister,   said. 

 The group also recommended that the administrative charge of the  , trade and commerce, and department of information and technology be given to a single full-time director.
 
 “Industry and IT should be headed by a single minister. The minister will be expected to coordinate among the departments and take holistic decisions. Several industries complement each other and the IT industry works for other industries. They cannot be looked at in isolation,” president GITP Gurudev Naik said.
 
  GITP said a single IAS officer in charge of both the departments with time-bound targets in terms of job creation in the private sector will reap higher dividends.
 
 “So far the directors have been given additional charge, leaving them no time to focus on effective functioning of their departments,” Naik said in an official statement.
 
 Highlighting that Goa has a disproportionate number of civil servants, GITP said that future job creation needs to happen in the private sector in knowledge-based and green industries such as IT, electronics and manufacturing.
