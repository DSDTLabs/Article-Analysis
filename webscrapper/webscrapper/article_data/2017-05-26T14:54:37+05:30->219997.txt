SURAT: After a 17-year-long  , Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) cleared two plots of land in   of Kanskiwad in ward 5 and in   in ward 9 of encroachments on Thursday.

 This razing of a few structures is a small step after a long legal battle, but it has paved way for other demolitions in Chauta Bazaar which is clogged with encroachments.
 
 This will have huge impact on other encroacher who have been fighting legal battle against SMC since years. Removal of encroachments from this area till now was next to impossible. 
 
 Large number of shop owners have encroached upon the city’s arterial road and have been resisting the road widening plans of the civic body since many years.
 
 The civic body on Thursday demolished two houses in Kanskiwad built over 241.69 sq m area, which was reserved for open space and garden area. It also demolished eight small roadside shops and cleared area of nearly 105 sqm. These shops are located at Chauta Bazaar main crossroad. This area is reserved for road building. 
 
 An official from town planning department of SMC said, “Our commissioner took a very strong stand despite the ongoing long legal stand and as a result we have been able to acquire this encroached land. This acquisition in Chauta Bazaar would help in the long run in road widening and easing traffic congestion.”
