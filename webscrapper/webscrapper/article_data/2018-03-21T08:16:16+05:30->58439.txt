The gang barged in and first gagged my sons in the bedroom. The men told me not to scream and show them the valuables. They left around 9.15pm and took away gold and silver ornaments,"   said. 
 
 She told police that the gang members were conversing in Hindi and Kannada. "They addressed me as 'madam' and didn't harm us," police said, quoting Anita. The gang sped away on motorcycles. "Gathering courage, I knocked on the doors of my neighbours and called police," Anita added.
