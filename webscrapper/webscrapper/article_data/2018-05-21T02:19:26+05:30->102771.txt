BHOPAL: One person was killed and another seriously injured after a lynch mob attacked them on suspicion of cow slaughter in Madhya Pradesh’s Satna district, police said on Saturday.

 
 Cops said the mob attacked Shiraz, 45, and his acquaintance, Shakeel, 35 late on Friday night.
 
 While Shiraz was killed on the spot, Shakeel was admitted to hospital, where his condition is said to be critical. “He is recuperating but he is not in a condition to give any statement,”  , manager of Metro Hospital in Jabalpur, told TOI.
 
 Cops have arrested four people — Pawan Singh, 35, Vijay Singh, 26, Phool Singh, 36, and Narayan Singh, 28 — for assaulting the two men. They were produced before a court on Saturday.
 
 Police have also booked the injured under cow slaughter prohibition Act merely on a verbal assessment by government doctor that the meat may be of beef. “All four were arrested and produced before court ,” said sub divisional officer Maihar Arvind  , adding that Shakeel had named the accused before he was shifted to Jabalpur for treatment. “Beef and skeleton was recovered from the spot,” said Tiwari.
 
 On being asked whether the meant sample was sent for tests, Tiwari said it wasn’t. When asked how he concluded the seized meat was beef, Tiwari said, “Civil surgeon has confirmed it.
 
 It is after the confirmation that the injured was booked under cow slaughter prohibition Act”. A civil surgeon is a qualified MBBS doctor who treats humans, but is not an expert to identify meat. Laboratory tests should be done to ascertain whether it was beef or not, say experts.
