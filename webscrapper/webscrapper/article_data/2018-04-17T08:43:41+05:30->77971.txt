AHMEDABAD: A special court hearing the 2002   finished hearing and reserved its order on an application by the accused persons demanding that ex-IPS officer, Rahul Sharma, and former investigator in this case, P L  , be arraigned as accused and tried for destruction of evidence.

 Chetan Shah, the lawyer of the accused, demanded that both the former investigators be tried for destroying CDs containing mobile phone records from the period of the 2002 riots. Mallâ€™s arraignment was also sought for his alleged improper probe. The application was filed in 2015.
 
 Shrama defended himself by submitting that it was he who had highlighted the existence of the evidence of call records, otherwise the investigators also had forgotten about the CDs which he had obtained in 2002 from private service providers. He argued that the original CDs may have been misplaced, but there is no evidence of destruction. The data he had saved was found to be authentic.
 
 Sharma claimed that since he had disclosed the existence of the CDs to an inquiry commission, he cannot be prosecuted.
 
 Mall, who probed the case as investigating officer for the Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT), told the court that he had investigated the case with utmost sincerity and the demand to implicate him must be rejected.
 
 In this case, 11 persons were killed at   on February 28, 2002. For this, 84 persons including police inspector V S Gohil were arrested and are being tried.
