NOIDA: The NCR RWA body has written to  , minister for food and public distribution, demanding permanent restriction or scrapping of service charges levied by hotels and restaurants, citing it illegal.

 A copy of the letter was also sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
 
 S Jain, president Confederation of NCR Residents Welfare Associations (CONRWA), said the common man is already burdened with many taxes and the after-effects of demonetisation. 
 
 “The deliberate levying of service charge by restaurants and hotels across the city is not only illegal but amounts to unnecessary burden on the residents’ pocket,” said Jain.
 
 Jain, in the letter sent to Paswan on Tuesday on behalf of CONRWA, argued that his ministry had clearly stated that paying service charges is voluntary, but the restaurants have opposed the move.
 
 “In this regard, this association, in order to remove any confusion, wants to request for a permanent restriction on levying of such charges,” said Jain. He addded that while restaurants have a right to fix whatever price they want on food items, they have no right to add any additional charge over written price except government taxes. “Levying any overhead charge is not only illegal, but is an indirect way of saving on Centre and state government taxes,” said Jain. 
 
 Additionally, CONRWA said customers already pay tips on the quality of service rendered. “The service charge is also a type of tip so it should neither be added to the bill nor can be fixed,” said Jain who rues how the practice of mandatory levying of service charge to the bill has become a norm instead of a voluntary move. 
 
 Also, according to CONRWA, restaurants do not convey to customers about service charge being added and so collect the tip as well from those who don’t read the fine print.
