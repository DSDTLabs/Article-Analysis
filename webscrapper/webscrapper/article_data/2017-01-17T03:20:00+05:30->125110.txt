Nagpur: The crime branch sleuths, who took charge of the La Horee bar firing case around six days back, have nabbed two absconding goons â€” Sheikhu Khan and Ravish Singh. They were produced before a court which remanded the accused in police custody for 10 days.

 Cops received a tip off that Sheikhu along with his accomplices was going to attend a party at a farmhouse on Amravati road. The police laid a trap and nabbed the duo. The police, however, are yet to recover from the accused the country made pistol which they had used to fire after a brawl in the La Horee incident.
 
 On November 13, Sheikhu, Sumeet Chintalwar and their accomplices were driven out of La Horee bar as they were teasing a girl. After that, the accused fired bullets in the air in the presence of cops and fled. On a complaint by bar owner Sameer Sharma, Sitabuldi police had registered a case. Sheikhu has several cases against him.
