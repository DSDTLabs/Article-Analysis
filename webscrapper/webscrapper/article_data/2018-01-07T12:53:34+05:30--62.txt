RAJKOT: A 22-year-old labourer was electrocuted on Saturday after coming in contact with an electric motor installed in an underground water tank in which he had stepped down to clean. 

 The incident occurred at Chandreshnagar Pumping Station of ward number 13 of   (RMC) where the deceased identified as Ganwant  , a resident of   in Raiyadhar of Rajkot, had gone into the water tank along with 25 labourers on Saturday morning. 
 
 “Rathod had been hired by an RMC contractor. After the accident he was rushed to Giriraj Hospital where he was declared brought dead. We have received allegations of negligence as it is a general practice to turn the motor off before cleaning the water tank. It appears that someone had forgotten to turn off the motor,” an official from   police station said. 
 
 Meanwhile, RMC commissioner   told reporters that strict action would be taken against those RMC officials responsible for the alleged negligence that resulted in the tragedy. “The incident will be investigated thoroughly and those responsible for the negligence will be found,” Pani said. 
 
 Pani also announced the aid of Rs 2 lakh for kin of the deceased labourer. 
 
 “As a part of safety measures, all electric equipment are covered by Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB), so are the pumping machineries. It is a matter of investigation whether the motor that caused the accident had been covered by the ELCB,” a source from the RMC said.
