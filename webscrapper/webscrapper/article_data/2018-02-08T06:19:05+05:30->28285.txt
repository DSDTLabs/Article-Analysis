Margao: The Supreme Court verdict on closure of mines, operating under their second renewal of leases, will have an adverse impact on the 180-odd barges engaged in the shipment of ore.

 “This is the sixth consecutive year barges have been left with no business. As it is, this year the mining business didn’t function properly. The order is unfortunate, I am not commenting on the merits of the order, but on the impact on our businesses. We will be facing the brunt as we don’t know how long this uncertainty will last,” Atul Jadhav of the Goa   Owners Association told TOI.
 
 Stating that an amount of Rs 109 crore is still left to be cleared by several barge owners to financial institutions, Jadhav said that the SC order has made the situation “even more worrisome.”
 
 “We had prevailed upon the government to extend the debt relief scheme for mining dependents to March 31, 2018. But considering the uncertain situation now, how are we to get loans to clear the old ones?” Jadhav said. He said that the association would now move the authorities concerned with a request to defer the loan recovery process.
