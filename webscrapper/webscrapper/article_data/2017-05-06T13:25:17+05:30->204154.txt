BELAGAVI: The   has decided to appoint   at the hobli level to eliminate fake   in the district. 

 With 1.60 lakh new applications for BPL cards received in the past couple of months, the district administration believes there could be many fake submissions. It is also difficult for the administration to dispose of such large number of new applications in a timely manner since the process is online and requires re-verification.
 
 As per the recommendation of nodal secretary Rakesh Singh, the district authority has submitted a proposal for the appointment of food inspectors for every taluk for verification of fake cards and new applications. There are about 40 hobli (revenue) centres in the district.
 
 There are about 10 lakh families in the district of which 7.97 lakh have BPL and 2.65 lakh have APL cards. Also, 45,000 families have Antyodaya cards. According to the survey of 2011, the population of the district is 47.79 lakh. Of them, 28 lakh people are enjoying the benefits of BPL and Antyodaya cards. With the number of BPL cards distributed almost equaling the number of families, it is believed that rich families, government servants and businessmen are in possession of fake cards.
 
 Shekhar Naroti, a construction worker who currently has an APL card, came to an internet centre to apply for a BPL card by paying Rs 100. “Many rich families of our village have also applied online. I don’t know how the authorities concerned will confirm my economic status,” he said.
 
 Sayida Banu Ballari, deputy director, food and civil supplies department, told TOI that it is possible that the number of families has increased since 2011. “Currently, there are no   in the district. The process of linking ration card number, LPG number, electricity RR number and property number of the beneficiary is also being done through the database of the National Informatics Centre,” she said.
