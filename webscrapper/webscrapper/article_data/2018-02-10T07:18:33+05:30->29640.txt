CHANDIGARH: Be careful while walking around in Sector 17. The   in the area, which are not constructed properly, can very well prove lethal to pedestrians roaming around there.

 During a visit to Sector 17, the road gully near the deputy commissioner’s office was found to be in broken. It was quite close to the pedestrian path and hence, could invite any untoward incident, especially during the night. However, the authorities never bothered to get them repaired, complained the residents and passers-by. Moreover, there is no streetlight installed in the area. 
 
 Yusaf, a shopkeeper, said the concerned officers were contacted for the repair of this road gully a number of times but in vain. “The height of this road gully is too low, compared to the height of the footpath and this is another issue to concern,” he said.
 
 The paver blocks installed at the backside of the market are uneven too. This also pose problems for the pedestrians.
 
 Another shopkeeper in Sector 17 said the paver blocks were repaired after a complaint was made to the authorities long back. However, they were not reconstructed properly. Hence, when two-wheelers were   the pavement, the blocks went back to their previous condition.
 
 A suggestion was also mooted that challans should be issued to those who park their vehicles on pavements of the market to demotivate the pubic.
 
 
 
 
 Municipal councillor   said that he will get the road gully repaired in the next two days from the concerned office of the Chandigarh municipal corporation. He said he will visit the other areas also to check if there is any other road gully, which is in the same condition, and get it repaired.
