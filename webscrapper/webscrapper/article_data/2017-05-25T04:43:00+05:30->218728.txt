Ahmedabad: With the deadline for private schools to submit details about their fee structures closing on Wednesday night, only about half of the total number of schools have presented affidavits or financial details to the fee regulation committees (FRC) formed under the new law.

 For primary schools charging fees below the governmentâ€™s cap, of 8,280 schools some 5,600 schools filed affidavits before the FRCs. 
 
 Of the 5,619 secondary and higher secondary schools in the state, 2,270 had filed affidavits by Wednesday evening, education officials said.
 
 For private schools charging fees higher than the cap, some 350 have sent proposals with details about their their fee structures, their account books etc. for the last couple of years. The number of private secondary and higher secondary schools charging higher-than-cap fees is 2,348.
 
 The FRC in Ahmedabad zone, which has jurisdiction over 10 districts, received 3,500 affidavits from schools claiming that the fees they charge are below the cap. The FRC has been able to scrutinize only 109 affidavits, and it has kept the cases of 11 schools pending on the grounds that the fee hikes for this academic year appeared to be too high. 
 
 These schools will be summoned for a hearing to justify their decision, an education department official said.
 
 Meanwhile, more than 100 schools affiliated with CBSE and ICSE have been exempted from submitting proposals to the FRC because Gujarat high court extended their deadline for submitting details from May 24 to June 15. There are sixty such schools in Ahmedabad city.
