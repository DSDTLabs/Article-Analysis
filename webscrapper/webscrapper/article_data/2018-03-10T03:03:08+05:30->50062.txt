MUMBAI: When an explosion took place at   on Thursday night, over a dozen   were working in the   without any  . The death toll in the fire could have been higher if not for a rudimentary instruction the young labourers had got from the experienced ones: “Run for life if you hear an explosion or see a flame.” 

 And that’s exactly what Dinesh Kumar (25), who was working at Novaphene for the past six months, and others did. Kumar, who sustained head injuries caused by splinters, said he had no idea that he was working amidst highly flammable materials. “We just ran out on hearing the explosion,” said the labourer undergoing treatment at Vikas hospital in Boisar. 
 
 Most of the labourers were working overtime on Thursday night when the incident took place and were to go home by Friday afternoon. 
 
 According to the guidelines of the Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health (DISH), all those working in hazardous units should be educated about the dangers and ways to deal with an emergency. But the survivors TOI spoke to said they have not been educated about the hazards of working in the solvent plants. 
 
 Sachin Yadav (19), a resident of Adarsh Nagar in Boisar, said that he was finishing work when he heard the explosion. “I rushed out of the plant and within seconds there was a series of explosions,” said Yadav, who sustained bruises. 
 
 A couple of others sustained head injuries when splinters hit them while running out of the factory. 
 
 The fire spread fast and three workers who were inside Aarti Drugs plant could not find their way out. Three charred bodies were found in a corner of the factory. Fire brigade personnel said no safety gear was found on them.
