PATNA: A 17-year-old girl was raped by his father’s driver at her Gosain Tola residence under the Pataliputra Colony police station area in   on May 27. The survivor is the daughter of a professor.

 
 Police sources said only the girl and her younger brother were inside the flat as their parents had gone out of station for a couple of days. The girl narrated the ordeal when her parents retuned on Tuesday night. Accused Anjay Panday (30) is a native of Maner. He was removed from the job by the professor last week. City SP (central) D Amarkesh said raids were on to nab Anjay. The survivor’s medical examination was conducted on Wednesday.
 
 “The incident took place between 1pm and 3pm when the survivor and her younger brother were in the flat,” police sources said. They said the driver entered the flat on the plea of keeping some household item and locked her younger brother inside a room and raped the girl.
 
 “A scuffle took place between the driver and the boy in which both were injured. After raping the girl, Anjay allegedly took her to a nearby hospital for treatment. However, the doctors at the hospital suspected foul play and asked them to return,” police said, adding the victim out of fear did not utter a single word to anyone until her parents returned.
 
 Police said the professor had hired a new driver, but Anjay had threatened him not to join duty saying he was the driver of the family. “An FIR was lodged under Section 376 (rape), 307 (attempt to murder) and 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) on a written complaint lodged by the survivor’s stepmother,” sources said.
 
 They said the professor’s first wife had died several years back and he had married another girl. “The professor is a heart patient and is in his late 50s while the wife is in her mid-30s,” police said.
