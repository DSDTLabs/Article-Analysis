HYDERABAD: Over a month after servicecommenced,   authoritieshave finally putup thetimetable of trains at the24 stations between   and  . In the form of flexies, the timetable lists the scheduled arrival of trains on either direction. But it is not the same as the real time electronic screens that are there in other Metros.

 The trains are operating at a15-minute gap. The schedules have been putup for theblueline, from Nagole to Ameerpet, and back from   to Nagole, and the red-line from Miyapur to Ameerpet, and Ameerpet to Miyapur. The timetable has been putup in two parts— one for trains running between 6am and 2pm, and the other for those operating between 2pm and 10pm.
 
 Though the timetable on flexes have been put up at the platform, as could be seen at some stations, authorities have not displayed this information either at the ground level or concourse level at the ticket counters. As a result, passengers waiting for trains at the platforms still do not have a clue about the arrival of the next train, either through the public announcement system or electronic displays. The only passengers who have an idea are the ones standing next to the flexes displaying thetime table.
 
 For more precise information, passengers have to depend on TSavaari app of L&T Metro Rail. Based on one’s location, the app shows the nearest metro station and thetime at which a train is expected at that station. Some more features include information about the nearest MMTS train, bus stops (though they do not appear to be precise), and booking of an Ola autoor cab.
