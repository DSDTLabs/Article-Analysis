GANDHINAGAR:   has demanded joint assembly committee of BJP and Congress MLAs to verify the government’s claims that it provided more than one lakh jobs in the recently-organized jobs fairs.

 Shaktisinh Gohil, senior  , in the   said he has collated authentic details of jobs provided at the recent fairs in four districts and found the claim to be a big lie. Gohil said: “I have official records of Rajkot, Morbi, Kutch and another district, running in 12,000 pages, which show that the   government’s claim of providing one lakh jobs in the recent job fairs a big lie. Those already working in factories for years were forced by local authorities to fill in employment forms. People’s thumb prints were taken by force. I checked hundreds of official forms which do not have the registration number of the local employment exchange. This clearly means that you have not given jobs to the registered unemployed but only forcibly taken signatures and thumb impressions of already-employed workers. I demand that a joint assembly committee of BJP and Congress go to all districts to verify the government’s claim of providing one lakh new jobs. This was just a publicity stunt.
