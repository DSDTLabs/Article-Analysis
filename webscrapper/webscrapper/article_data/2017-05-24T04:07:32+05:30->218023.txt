KOLKATA: The   (KMDA) is constructing two underpasses — one near   and the other opposite   — on   to ease pedestrian movement. Expecting a surge in pedestrian traffic during the upcoming under-17 Fifa World Cup, the agency has set an October deadline to complete the projects.

 According to a KMDA official, work of setting up the underpass opposite Hyatt, which had started in January this year, is now in advanced stage of completion. “But the one at Chingrihata could be started this month as it took a little time to get permission from the Sports Authority of India,” he said.
 
 “We are confident of opening the underpass opposite Hyatt Regency well before the tournament. As for the underpass at Chinrighata, we have started work with full resources but it will be a little difficult to complete before the World Cup. However, the agency is trying their best,” said state urban development and municipal affairs department secretary OS Meena. The department has sanctioned Rs 32 crore for the underpassses.
 
 Once the underpasses are thrown open, pedestrians who now often risk their lives to cross EM Bypass at these crossings would be able to pass by smoothly. With several malls, hospitals and other commercial establishments coming up off EM Bypass, vehicular traffic on the Bypass stretch is increasing manifold over last few years. The underpasses will help to increase traffic speed as well.
