VADODARA: Income tax inspector,  , who allegedly killed his wife   in the city, plotted the crime in such a way that he could get away with it. Such could be his meticulous planning that Chaudhary may have chosen a house where he could kill her without anyone getting a whiff of it. 

 House number 40 in   on Harni Road was a perfect place for   to kill Munesh and also bury her body. Located in a secluded corner of the society, this bungalow attracted least attention and not many locals too visited it. According to the residents, the house remained unoccupied after the previous owner sold it off to a non-resident Indian in June last year.
 
 The rear side of the house also faces two bungalows of neighbouring Sugam Park socity and these are also unoccupied. The adjacent plot is the common area of the society is nothing less than a grazing place for bovines. 
 
 “The area is very silent and the only noise we hear is if a vehicle passes by or of the aeroplanes. As the bungalow is located at the end of the lane, nobody used to go there especially after dark because there are no streetlights in the lane,” said a resident of Trisha Duplex.
 
 “A Sikh family lived in the house where the crime happened, but the owner too was looking to sell it off for the last three years. However, he may not be getting the desired price. After his wife died due to some natural reasons, the house was sold off last year at a lower price,” said a woman, who lives five houses away from that bungalow. 
 
 Another man who lives in the same lane said, “The house remained unoccupied after that but some four to five months ago I had seen a board seeking tenants on the gate. However, we never saw anyone coming there or leaving even in last one month.”
 
 “A stray dog was barking near the bungalow’s gate for past many days, but we did not pay much attention until the police came here on Sunday and exhumed the body,” said another resident.
