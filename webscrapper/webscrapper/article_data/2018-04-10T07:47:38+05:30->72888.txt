AHMEDABAD: A defence lawyer on Monday told the SIT court hearing the 2002  , that mobile call records pertaining to the time of the   were tampered with by ex-IPS officer Rahul Sharma as part of a conspiracy to “malign Gujarat and Hindus”.

 Chetan Shah, an advocate for the accused, argued that maligning the image of the state and Hindus, particularly the Hindus implicated in the case, was part of a larger conspiracy.
 
 While presenting evidence to substantiate his demand that Sharma be implicated for destruction of evidence, Shah pointed out that if service providers like AT&T and Celforce provided comprehensive data, it may also have had details pertaining to him and other top officials of the state. However, his own number did not reflect in the records, nor did those of important people in the state, hence, evidence had been tampered with.
 
 Shah also argued that the investigating agency did not see an offence, when the CDs containing the call records went missing. If the data was not tampered with, it should have had information about all mobile phone users in the CDs. However, the data provided by Sharma does not contain all information.
 
 When the defence advocate was putting forward his arguments, Sharma, who in the courtroom, laughed. 
 
 This irked the lawyer and he raised an objection, asking why Sharma should laugh at him. Special judge M K Dave asked the lawyer to proceed but an irritated Shah told the court that all parties in the case were prejudiced against him.
 
 The lawyer tendered an application to the court to take necessary action on the ground that the decorum of the court was not upheld. The next hearing has been posted for Wednesday.
