NAGPUR: Vidarbha Plastic Industries Association termed the state government’s blanket ban on all plastic bags and packaging material from Gudi Padwa as a political statement. The proposed ban has created panic not only among manufacturers, wholesale dealers but also among workers in the plastic industry.

 “Maharashtra environment minister   cannot issue such a statement. Until the government issues notification about the ban inviting suggestions and objections, they cannot impose a blanket ban,” said association’s secretary   addressing a press conference here on Saturday. 
 
 The association demanded the government to form a joint committee comprising stakeholders, environmentalists and government to discuss notification before it comes into force. The association said their delegation will meet chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and union transport minister Nitin Gadkari over the issue.
 
 There are around 150 plastic product manufacturing industries in Vidarbha and the annual turnover is around Rs1,000 crore, said the association members, adding, “If closed, it will render thousands of people jobless.”
 
 Instead of ban, the government should frame guidelines about educating end users, said industrialists. According to them, the government should create awareness about using plastic nicely and dispose it wisely. They emphasized that plastic is 100 % recyclable. 
 
 According to industrialist  , the association wanted to work together with authorities in ensuring that plastic does not damage the environment. In the past, the association had met with the then municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar and submitted expression of interest seeking a piece of land either in city limits or outside where we had proposed to treat plastic waste, he said. But nothing has been done so far. 
 
 “The need for plastic can never be undermined since it is used in all sectors of the economy,” said past president of the association Dilip Kumar Gandhi.
