Mumbai: Days before its release, film director   on Monday, agreed to give   to   Nilesh Girkar in the Amitabh Bachchan-starrer  .

 Girkar took Verma to high court alleging infringement of his copyright in the film’s story. Girkar, through his lawyer Rahul Ajatshatru, argued that the film’s forthcoming release be stayed. Girkar’s case was that in July 2012 he had submitteda his story to Verma and narrated it again in 2013 but last December Verma denied him any rights in the film.
 
 In court, Verma undertook before Justice Gautam Patel to ensure that the opening credits mention that the film is “Based on a story written by Nilesh Girkar”. And he also agreed to pay Rs 6.2 lakh in unpaid fees to Girkar.
 
 The digital prints for international theatrical release were already despatched and it will be difficult to incorporate this credit in those prints. The judge said, “In all other prints including international satellite, cable, domestic releases and other digital platforms this credit will appear.”
