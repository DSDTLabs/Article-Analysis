PUNE: The   for Pune zone is likely to fall short of the overall target for the fiscal ended March 31,2017, as collections were affected in the aftermath of demonetisation.

 The   for the zone fell short by around Rs 350 crore. However,   softened the blow.
 
 The overall target for service tax, customs and central excise was Rs 20,130 crore. However, about Rs 19,933 crore could be collected, resulting in an   shortfall of Rs 197 crore for the zone. The zone includes Pune district, Solapur district, Kolhapur, Goa, and adjoining areas.
 
 “The indirect tax collection was somewhat affected by demonetisation,” said a senior service-tax officer.
 
 Service tax collection was around Rs 9,100 crore as on March 31, against a target of Rs 9,500 crore. There were, however, some yet-to-be accounted receipts that the officer said, will help them come close to the target.
 
 Collections from customs was Rs 3,283 crore, against a target of Rs 3,130 crore.   collection is, however, not included in this calculation.
