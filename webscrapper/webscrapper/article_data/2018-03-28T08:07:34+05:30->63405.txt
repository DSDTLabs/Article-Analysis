AHMEDABAD: At a time when state tourism officials are earnestly promoting tourism in   through its Khushbu Gujarat Ki campaign, the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) is preparing to train tourist guides through certified courses. The industry body will soon ink a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the state tourism department, confirmed top   officials.

 “Though there are many tourist sites in the state of historical and religious significance, it lacks certified tourist guides,” said Shailesh Patwari, the president of the GCCI. “Gujarat is the preferred investment destination and foreign nationals tend to visit tourism sites too. Therefore, there is a need for certified tourist guides here.”
 
 Patwari went on to say: “We’ve approached the tourism department and it has considered our proposals positively.” He said once the MoU is signed, the GCCI will be allowed to offer certificate courses for tour guides. “This will be implemented in Ahmedabad, Porbandar, Rajkot and Vadodara,” he said. The MoU will be inked soon after the assembly session and the GCCI will begin inviting applications soon, he said.
 
 State tourism department officials confirmed that they have received the proposal from the industry body and a final decision will soon be taken to facilitate its implementation. GCCI officials said that the initiative will help create employment in the state and also help organize the tourism sector, especially with a number of new tourist circuits being announced by the government. Moreover, Unesco has given the World Heritage City status to Ahmedabad.
 
 The industry body will rope in experts to impart training. “Courses will include soft-skills training and etiquette in addition to modules on the history of Gujarat and historical significance of monuments,” Patwari said. At the end of the training, a government-approved certification will be given to the tour guides, said an official.
