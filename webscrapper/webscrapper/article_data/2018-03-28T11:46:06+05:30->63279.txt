PANAJI: A mini slum in a lowlying area with 14 illegal structures in   by the creek of Chimbel river has been turned into a residential-cum-business area with tenements, godowns and a poultry unit. A team of Merces panchayat officials led by sarpanch   found that sheds of the structures built in blatant violation of coastal regulation zone ( ) area accommodate over 250 persons.

 “The entire area is in an unhygienic condition with sewage being released into the river,”  , secretary of   (MMWA) said. The tenant, who had illegally reclaimed the area and raised the structures near the creek, had been asked to produce documents, construction permissions and mandatory licences. “He failed to produce any document,” a panchayat member said.
 
 MMWA complained, throughout the various phases of the unauthorized reclamation and construction, to the Goa coastal zone management authority for over a decade. “The authorities failed to initiate action and the activities have continued,” Jose Oliveira of MMWA said. MMWA and   members, who were present, demanded the demolition of all illegal structures.
 
 Merces panchayat secretary   said that the matter will be raised at the panchayat meeting.
