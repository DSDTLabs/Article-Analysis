Ahmedabad: Officials of the Excavation Branch-V of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) marked Republic Day with a cleanliness drive at Gunja, 8 km from Vadnagar in Mehsana district. Gunja is known for its water tank, considered an architectural marvel.

 Abhijit Ambekar, deputy superintending archaeologist, Excavation Branch-V, said that the tank has unique features. 
 
 “A pillared open pavilion built in the middle of the tank is connected by a bridge to the bank,” he said. “This bridge is known for its architectural design. The western fringe of this tank is built of stones laid out as steps. This gives it the impression of a ghaat,” Ambekar said.
 
 ASI officials said they had stumbled upon the structure during a recent visit and decided to clean it up with local people. 
 
 “The cleanliness drive was done to spread the message that such steps bring back the original character of monuments and help preserve them besides deterring others from turning it into a garbage dumping yard,” said an official.
