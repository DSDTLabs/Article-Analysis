NEW DELHI: President   made a thumping debut on Twitter on Tuesday soon after he was sworn in. He opened with a tweetstorm of over 30 posts — most of them a live relay of his inaugural speech.

 Through most of the day, #PresidentKovind remained the top national trend on Twitter. Other related trends were “14th President” and “Rashtrapati Ramnath” in Hindi. Several Cabinet ministers and state chief ministers chimed in with congratulatory tweets.
 
  
  
 
 Kovind’s first tweet, “Honoured to be sworn in as the 14th   of India; would be carrying out my responsibilities with all humility #PresidentKovind”, was retweeted over 6,000 times and ‘liked’ over 20,000 times. “Very inspiring address by President Ram Nath   Ji, which beautifully summed up the essence of India’s strengths, democracy & diversity,” tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
  
  
  
  
 
 Congress MP Shashi Tharoor wrote: “Impressive ceremony in Parliament as #PresidentKovind sworn in. His 1st sentence, hailing mutual respect as essence of democracy, augurs well.”
 
 Kovind is now available on the President of India’s official handle @rashtrapatibhvn, earlier used by Pranab Mukherjee. Mukherjee’s earlier tweets are not available on this handle anymore. They are all now archived on @POI13.   currently has 3.28 million followers, most of them inherited from the earlier account.
