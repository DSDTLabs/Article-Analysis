CHENNAI: Is former chief minister   bigger than even  , the famous Scottish actor, well-known for his portrayal of  ? Finance minister D Jayakumar appears to think so.

 On Tuesday, he took a dig at Panneerselvam, drawing a parallel between him and the James Bond star and stating sarcastically that the rebel leader was bigger than Connery.
 
 OPS faction MLAs jumped to their feet, demanding that the remark be expunged as it was an 'insult' to the former CM. The chair, however, refused to accede to their requests. Panneerselvam, who was present in the house, remained unruffled.
 
 The debate was triggered by DMK MLA T Udhayasuriyan talking about the manner in which the budget documents were brought into the House by Jayakumar and his predecessor Panneerselvam.
 
 Jayakumar, known for his repartee, stood up to say, “You talked about OPS. I would say he is bigger than Sean Connery. Look at us, we are not Oscar-winning actors, we are simple,“ the minister said, evoking laughter and loud thumping of desks by the treasury benches.
 
 The reference to OPS' 'acting skills' comes in the wake of the former CM choosing to meditate at Jayalalithaa's memorial before his dramatic rebellion against Sasikala on February 7. The minister chided the DMK MLA for talking about the size of the briefcase in which the budget document was carried, rather than the budget itself which has surpassed Rs 1.5 lakh crore.
 
 “Think of the voluminous budget presented. It will be fair if you debate on the deficit, the revenue receipts, share from the Central taxes, and how much it has reduced and how to tackle it,“ Jayakumar said, even as OPS camp MLAs were bent on getting the chair to expunge the 'James Bond' remarks against the former CM.
 
 When DMK MLA S R Raja (Tambaram) was seen gesturing to the speaker to permit the OPS faction MLAs to speak, leader of the house K A Sengottaiyan wondered why the opposition MLA was pleading on their behalf. This set off further uproar in the House.
