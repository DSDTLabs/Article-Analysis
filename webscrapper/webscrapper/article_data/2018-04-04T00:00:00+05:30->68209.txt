"I started voting in 1992 in each and every   — be it local, assembly or Lok Sabha. Generally, I have been on duty on election day, so I finish voting early in the morning and go for duty. In Bengaluru, the voting turnout is very less when compared to rural areas. When a person in the rural areas can  , we urban dwellers should display much more enthusiasm and interest than they do. People should come out of their homes and exercise their right to vote. If you don’t vote, you have no right to question politicians. Everyone should come out and look at the people who are standing for elections, so that the most able person is chosen to represent us. 

 "Urban voters seem to think that all politicians are alike and that no one does any work. Or, they think that there is no fun in voting; why waste time standing in queues. This is the general feeling. People here tend to put everyone in the same basket and label politicians as people who don’t work. Also, for urban voters, voting day is usually over the weekend. People are in a lazy mood and don’t want to get out of their homes. It barely takes 10-15 minutes, or a maximum of 30 minutes, to cast your vote. This is a lethargic state and most people don’t think twice about why they aren’t stepping out to vote. There is no specific reason for this — urban voters have been like this for a long time. This is the time when they should chuck their laziness and go out and vote. 
 
 When someone is asking for their fundamental rights and complaining about infrastructure, why isn’t there passion when it comes to election time? All it takes is half an hour of your time to choose someone who will be your leader, to ensure that all your problems are addressed for the next five years."
