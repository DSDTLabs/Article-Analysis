PUNE: Peer pressure, a growing sense of intolerance and competition are among the main reasons for the rising cases of violence on school and college campuses, experts said.

 “Teenagers have become intolerant due to high level of competition in every sense of life. Jealously is the prime reason and sometimes insecurity also leads to aggression,” psychologist and counsellor   told TOI.
 
 
 She said teenagers, these days, have a sense of rebellion and revenge. “They want to rebel and want to take revenge even for small things in their lives. They don’t believe in solving their issues with a peaceful dialogue and resort to violence for instant justice,” Pendse added.
 
 Parents and teachers can work together to pacify or mellow down such students by paying more attention towards them. “I think parents and teachers can play a key role in pacifying their attitude. Teachers can identify students, who can be trouble makers and parents too can sense if their ward is becoming aggressive. A little counselling and timely intervention can make a huge difference,” Pendse said. 
  
 
 Sanjeev Sonawane, head of education and extension department at the  , said there are about 10% of total students in educational institutions with violent nature. “They are known as problem child who would constantly argue over petty things with their classmates or teachers. They are just waiting for a chance to take revenge,” he said.
 
 Sonawane said it is important for teachers and faculties in colleges to identify such students and counsel them. “Identifying nature of students in their class and counsel those in need is also an important part of ateacher's job.”
