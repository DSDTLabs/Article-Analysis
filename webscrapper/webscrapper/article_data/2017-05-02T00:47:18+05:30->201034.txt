New Delhi: A day after TOI reported about an FIR filed by a Lok Sabha   alleging an extortion bid of Rs 5 crore,   said on Monday that they had identified the  . Raids were conducted at her house but she was not found, the police said.

 The woman herself has alleged that she was first raped by K C Patel, the MP from Valsad in  , at his official residence on March 3 when he invited her for dinner. “I was raped multiple times by Patel. I had to make a CD as evidence so that he stops threatening me,” she said. 
 
 Around a month ago, she went to the Ghaziabad police to register a complaint but did not give a written complaint. According to the woman, she was told to go to Delhi Police as it did not come under the jurisdiction of Ghaziabad police. Pradeep Tripathi, SHO of Indiarapuram, said the woman said she would submit the CD only after an FIR was registered. 
 
 The woman said she “approached the court to know the status of my complaint after the police refused to register my case”.
 
 Both Patel and the police have rubbished the allegations. Special commissioner Mukesh Meena said investigations had revealed that the woman earlier registered a rape case against an MP from Haryana at Tilak Marg police station but later withdrew it. 
 
 “She took back her complaint when the police started probing it. We are investigating all possible angles,” Meena said. “This is a case of extortion. No case of rape has been registered,” he added. The police are going through her call details. 
 
 Patel claimed that he had been framed and he was waiting for a probe to clear his name. “I will cooperate in the investigation,” he said.
