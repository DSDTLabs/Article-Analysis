AHMEDABAD: An associate professor with St Xavier’s College has filed a complaint with Satellite police against his ex-wife for assault and intimidation. Police have lodged a complaint under sections of IPC and IT Act.

 Satellite police said Ishwar Mehra, 46, a resident of Nandan Apartment, Ramdevnagar, had married   Mehra in 1995. The couple has two children aged 19 and 15. After marital discord, the couple got divorce in 2014 and   got custody of the children. Ramila Mehra got married again to Ramnivas Agarwal, a resident of Goyal Park, Judges Bungalow Road.
 
 According to Ishwar’s complaint, Ramila continued to harass him even after the settlement in court and a written statement to the police that there would be no harassment from her to the family. He claimed that she continued to send her objectionable messages and threatened to defame him in a case.
 
 “On March 18, she allegedly entered in his residence with an unknown person and rummaged through a few drawers. When his daughter raised an alarm, Mehra’s father went to check. At that time, the two had an altercation with the family members after which she left the premises. We are yet to record the statement of the accused in the case,” said a Satellite police official. tnn
