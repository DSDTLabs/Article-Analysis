Surat: “Surat is one city that has shown the world how a city can become the centre of economic growth using its own strength,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said here as he arrived to a rousing reception at the Surat aiport en route Dahej and Bharuch.  In his brief six-minute address to a massive gathering, Modi said that Surat has achieved this economic growth in a span of just 25 years.  On a lighter note, he even said that gathering so many Surtis in mid-afternoon was a commendable effort. Modi was felicitated by chief minister Vijay Rupani along with representatives of Surat Bar Association and Medical Practitioners Association. “Scarcity of doctors has been a nagging problem in our country. But we have increased 4,000 seats in post-graduate medical courses at one stroke and this would provide sufficient number of doctors that the country would need in the future. These PGs would become professors in their own specialty area and prepare large number of doctors to the country,” Modi said. He also touched upon the Gujarat’s accomplishment of making its cities open defecation-free in a short span of time and said that nearly 500 cities and large number of villages would be free from this scourge of open defecation. The local BJP unit had galvanized its full machinery and pressed 300 luxury buses to bring people from nearby rural areas and towns at the airport.
