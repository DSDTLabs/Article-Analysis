BELAGAVI: In an effort to help engineering students, who enrolled in their respective courses between 2006 and 2010, complete their degrees sooner,   (VTU),   has come up with a seven-week crash semester programme.

 The initiative is meant for those students who would otherwise lose an entire year, as a result of arrears or backlogs they have accumulated. An arrear from the first year of the engineering course has to be cleared before the third year, otherwise he or she is denied admission to the fifth semester. Similarly, a student seeking admission to the seventh semester should not have backlogs from the second year. However, under the new scheme, the students who manage to clear their arrears, can enrol in the crash semester programme that is being conducted from December 2016 to February 2017, and based on their performance in the fifth and seventh semester examination, directly join the sixth and eighth semesters respectively.
 
 The decision to offer students who joined engineering courses between 2006 and 2010 the crash semester programme was taken at the VTU executive council meeting held on December 16, 2016.
 
 VTU registrar   told TOI that the varsity had taken the decision to ensure that students did not lose one whole year. “If the students clears the examinations that will be held at the end of the crash course, he or she will be directly promoted to the next semester,“ he added.
 
 Pallavi Raju Kottalagi, a student, said, “I was seeking admission to fifth semester, but with the new programme, I can directly join the sixth semester.Although there is not much time, it is great that we have been given this opportunity.“
