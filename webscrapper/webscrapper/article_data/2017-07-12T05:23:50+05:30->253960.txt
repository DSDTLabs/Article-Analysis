Mumbai: The   ( ) has backed the   stir launched in Bengaluru by the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV), a radical   known for wearing its Kannada stripes with gusto.

 KRV chief Narayan Gowda has sent an invite to the MNS to attend a seminar on the BJP’s attempts to thrust Hindi on states in violation of the country’s federal structure, said MNS leader Sandip Deshpande on Tuesday. The seminar will be held in Bengaluru on Saturday. It was learnt that Shiv Sena has not been invited for the seminar. 
 
 Stating that Gowda had telephonic talks with MNS president Raj Thackeray earlier in the day, Deshpande said, “Rajsaheb has backed the KRV stir. We too are of the view that the BJP is going out of its way to impose Hindi on states. Marathi has suffered a setback because the Centre has been arbitrarily insisting on the use of Hindi,” Deshpande added. Thackeray has deputed Deshpande to attend the day-long conclave as MNS representative.
