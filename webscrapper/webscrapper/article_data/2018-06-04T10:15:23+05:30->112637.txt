Bhagya Lakshmi’s mother interferes as she (Bhagya Lakshmi) is about to take Shravya away. She gives her a mouthful for her stupid behaviour. She handovers Shravya’s responsibility to Soundarya. Mounitha thinks that Deepa will be expelled from the house for sure.

 Meanwhile Soundarya and family along with the family reach home. Shravya is upset about her miscarriage. Soundarya, who threw a party announcing Shravya’s pregnancy earlier, is afraid of the embarrassment she has to face now. She reminds Soundarya that it is Adithya, (her husband) who revealed Deepa’s role behind her miscarriage.
 
 On Adithya’s request, Soundarya summons Malathi (their servent maid). She admits mixing saffron given by Deepa. Soundarya is infuriated to know this. In the meantime, Deepa comes down to inquire about Shravya’s health condition. She is devastated to learn about Shravya’s miscarriage. Soundarya chastises Deepa for her sinful deed. Raging with anger, Soundarya shames Deepa and orders her to leave the house.
 
 Deepa pleads not to be guilty of this. Adithya who always showered affection towards Deepa questions as to why she committed such a sinful act. Deepa is upset about the fact that even Adithya believes that she is guilty of this.
 
 Soundarya drives Deepa out and closes the door. In his prayer, Murali Krishna questions god about the injustice to Shravya. While his wife and mother-in-law accuse Deepa of the miscarriage, Murali Krishna rebukes his mother-in-law for the baseless allegations.
