KERI: Arvalem waterfall in the Bicholim taluka, one of Goa’s iconic waterfalls, reduces to a trickle during summer, however, this year, the fall has dried up even before peak season, and locals are blaming haphazard mining activities for the water crisis.

 Locals say that it is for the first time in the last half-century that the beautiful cascade has dried up in the last week of March. Last year, the fall had dried up during the last week of May. 
 
 Arvalem waterfall, a popular attraction for tourists and locals, hold special significance for Hindus from Goa and Konkan, who come here to perform the last rites of their relatives .
 
 Prakash Pednekar, 62, resident of Arvalem, said haphazard mining activities in the upper reaches has caused the fall to dry up. “The groundwater table as well as other water resources feeding the river upstream have been destroyed,” he said.
 
 Those who have seen the flow in upstream areas agreed with Pednekar. “Water level of the Cudnem river originating in Bhuimpal, Sattari has drastically reduced. The natural streams coming from Pissurlem have been destroyed by mining activities. The streams flowed as long as mining companies pumped water out of the mining pits,” wildlifer from   said.
 
 With mining activities in the state coming to a stop since March 16, the artificial supply due to pumping of water from mining pits into the river has stopped.
 
 “Water bodies in our area are badly affected by mining activities. After closure of mining, I requested the mamlatdar of Sattari to take the needful steps for releasing water from the mining pits into the streams and rivulets. We are presently suffering from a water crisis,” social activist from Pissurlem, Hanumant Parab told TOI. 
 
 A visiting group from Maharashtra were taken aback to see the dried up waterfall.
