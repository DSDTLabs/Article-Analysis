HYDERABAD: With the lid blown off a thriving contract   recently, police have now found that one of the three   agents arrested had visited the city 24 times earlier. The Omani agent, Al Qasimi Hassan Mazaaul Mohamed, was on his 25th trip to Hyderabad when he was nabbed, said  , assistant commissioner of police, Falaknuma. “He has been a frequent visitor to the city between 2012 and 2017. They (the agents) used to be in touch with brokers in Hyderabad and were acting as a bridge between the clients in Oman and the brokers,“ a police official said.

 “However, we are yet to find out how many marriages he fixed on his last 24 trips. We also found that the rest of the Omani nationals arrested, including three agents and five clients, had visited the city at least four times. We are now checking their passports and will investigate the matter further," said ACP Tajuddin.
 
 The cops were also shocked to find that all the Omani agents were married to Hyderabadi women and used their marriages to broker deals.
