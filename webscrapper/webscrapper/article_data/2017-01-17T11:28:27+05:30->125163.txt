VADODARA: The detection of crime branch (DCB) arrested former driver of Kalpesh alias  , one of the prime accused in the Mukesh Harjani murder case.

 Bharatsinh alias   was arrested late on Sunday evening. Baria took care of the logistics before and after Harjani was murdered. A police official said that Baria was working as Patel’s driver in 2004. In October last year, he met Patel two to three times and asked him for a job.
 
 Patel called Baria near   complex on   and revealed the murder plan to him. Baria’s job was to show the way to other accused to the crime scene and later drop them wherever they said. Patel had promised him economic benefits in return. Baria admitted to the police that on the day of the murder, he had dropped Salim alias Khatiyo Sheikh, one of the hired killers from Madhya Pradesh, on his two-wheeler at Vrundavan Township where Harjani was murdered.
 
 Later, he had dropped Sheikh, Mohammed Akbar and Anil alias Anthony Gangwani, who all have been arrested, at Godhra railway station in Patel’s car, the police said. Cops said that Baria has not yet revealed details about whereabouts of Viju Sindhi, another prime accused who is on run. A local court remanded Baria to police custody for two days on Monday.
 
 A police official said that Baria will be further interrogated about the economic benefits that Patel had promised him and where he was hiding during the past months. 
 
 Baria was arrested in the past too by Navsari local crime branch (LCB) in connection with a prohibition case.
