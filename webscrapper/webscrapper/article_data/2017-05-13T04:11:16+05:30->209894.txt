NAGPUR: The employees of   have once again come together to quest the thirst of people of parched areas. This summer, they are dispatching drinking water to the tribal drought-affected villages in  , Amravati.

 On Friday morning, around 15,000 litres of drinking water sealed in pouches was sent through truck that flagged off from the Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) office. In the coming two months, around eight such trips would be made to three most affected villages — Kulangana, Madki and Aahad which are over 200 kilometres away from Nagpur.
 
 The villages were selected after a survey that was conducted by some employees last week. “We visited Melghat and though malnutrition is a problem in most of the villages, these three were suffering the most due to scarcity of water. Even after digging as deep as 300 feet, villagers cannot find water,” said chief train clerk  . 
 
 The cost of each trip will be around Rs70,000, which incudes cost of water, diesel and transportation. “Over 150-200 employees of Nagpur Central Railway have contributed for the cause. We are expecting support from organizations too,” Khatekar added. The next trip will be on May 26. 
 
 Last year, the young staffers of Nagpur Central Railway took to the social media and started created groups, urging people to join them in helping people of drought-affected Latur. Thousands of water pouches were distributed to people living in Harunbhai, Bhusmurd and Nandgaon villages.
