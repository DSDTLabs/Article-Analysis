KOLHAPUR: Sustained agitation by the Congress-NCP as well as   over the   has delayed the   from farmers in Kolhapur district.

 “The protests by the parties for loan waiver has ignited fresh hopes in the farmers that their debts will be written off, which has adversely affected the recovery,” an official of the Kolhapur district central cooperative bank (KDCCB) told TOI on Monday.
 
 “As it is, more than 40,000 farmers have defaulted on Rs 158 crore loans in the last decade,” the official said.
 
 Union finance minister Arun Jaitley recently ruled out farm loan waivers by the Centre, saying that states can utilise their own resources in this regard. 
 
 The minister clarified that the Centre will not adopt a selective approach by helping one state and not the others.
 
 “The loan recovery is considerable in western   due to an assured income generated through sugar cane crop. The bills of sugar cane are deposited in farmers’ accounts in our bank, we deduct the loan instalments from this. However, since the debate on loan waiver started, recovery of loan payment has slowed down,” the KDCCB official said.
 
 Another official of the bank said, “The government is not clear about its policy. Once it comes out with a clear message for farmers, they will start clearing their dues.”
