Panaji: To verify collated data on public amenities and civic tax payers in the capital city, Imagine Panaji   Development Ltd (IPSCDL), the implementing agency for the Smart City Mission, will launch a door-to-door survey on January 15. 

 IPSCDL director Sidharth Kuncalienker on Wednesday said staff of CRISIL, a private ratings company, would visit 8,000 households in the city within a 40-day period to understand their views on 52 parameters.
 
 Under the Smart City Mission, IPSCDL has already begun geographic information system (GIS) mapping of the capital city to improve municipal tax collection and identify defaulters. The aim of the survey and GIS mapping is to ensure all residential and commercial properties come under the tax radar of the Corporation of the City of Panaji and to ensure all properties are assessed at the correct rate.
 
 “Two things that will be taken care of through this intervention are the under-assessed and unassessed properties,” MD and CEO of IPSCDL, Swayan Chaudhuri, said. “That gap needs to be identified by the survey. We are doing a LIDAR (light detection and ranging)-based drone survey and to corroborate the data, we will launch a door-to-door survey.”
 
 Citizens of Panaji will also be asked about house tax payments along with the experiences they’ve had regarding garbage collection, electricity and water supply, and other issues.
 
 “If someone does not get water, we will know this. There are some places where water is not supplied,” Kuncalienker said. 
 
 In the Sao Tome area, for instance, the government has laid new water pipelines but supply lasts just two hours per day.
