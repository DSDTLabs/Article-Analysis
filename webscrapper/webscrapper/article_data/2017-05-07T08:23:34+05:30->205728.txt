PUNE: The civic administration on Saturday said that it has worked on a contingency plan to deal with garbage and ensure that residents do not suffer due to the deadlock over dumping garbage at Uruli. 

 According to civic chief  , the plan will focus on running garbage processing units at maximum capacity, processing over 1,050 tonne garbage everyday, lifting of daily garbage, storing untreated dry waste at certain processing plants and treating stored garbage in phases. "We are working towards treating maximum garbage even as we hold talks with villagers. We are hoping for a solution at the earliest,"   said.
 
 He pointed out that, at present, 33 of 37 garbage processing units are functional. "The situation is under control," Kumar said.
 
 Regardless, residents have been complaining about piling garbage and instances of burning of trash.
 
 Kumar said, "Lifting of garbage and door-to-door waste collection has not stopped. We have instructed staff to ensure that garbage goes for treatment without delay."
 
 At the same time, the administration has continued its talks with villagers to convince them that steps are being taken to process garbage in a more scientific manner at Uruli.
 
 Solid waste department officials said there was a plan to restart some processing units and increase the daily garbage treatment capacity.
 
 Collector   told TOI that the proposal to acquire land at   is the in final stages of approval. The land at  , which is under the civic body's possession will be given to the forest department in lieu of this land. Officials said villagers should not have any problem with the land as it wasn't near the village. It's in an enclosed reserved forest area. Moreover, garbage will be treated scientifically at the site so no foul smell would emanate. The civic body has said it would take a year for the site to become operational since it will be done in a technical manner.
