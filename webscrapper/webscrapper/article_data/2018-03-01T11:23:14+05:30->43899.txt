BHOPAL: State finance minister   announced construction of a six-lane expressway between   and Indore at a cost of Rs 5,000 crore. 

 Approval has been given in principle for the expressway to be built under Bharatmala scheme of the Union government, he said. Apart from the expressway, bypass roads at Jabalpur, Sagar, Gwalior and Orcha are also proposed under the scheme. Taking a dig at Congress, the minister said that in 2003 commuters had to "look for roads in the potholes". "You are aware about the work done in the sector after 2003. In 2018-19, we have set a target to construct 3,000km road and 150 bridges, besides renovation of 3,500 km road," the minister stated.
 
 The Expressway will be independent of the existing Bhopal-Indore highway and will cut travel time by half an hour. Beyond this, there wasn't much cheer for Bhopal or Indore. Apart from the customary allocation for Smart City.
