Vadodara: The BCCI may soon hire a full time sports psychologist for the women’s cricket team. 

 The Indian women’s team coach Tushar Arothe has suggested to BCCI to rope in a sports psychologist for the team. “I made the suggestion and the cricket board has accepted it. The team needs a sports psychologist to improve its mental strength,” Arothe told TOI. 
 
 “We were in winning position but the players panicked and succumbed to the mental pressure in dying overs in World Cup finals. Having a professional who can help them build their mental strength will definitely help the team,” Arothe said. 
 
 The 50-year-old coach said that the WC was a great learning experience for him as well as the team. 
 
 He had coached the Indian women between 2009 and 2011 and again hired for the same job for a year in 2012. “When I was offered the coach’s job this time, I was excited but there was also some pressure as World Cup is a big event. When we started the campaign, no one expected us to even qualify. But we reached the finals. I guess this may be the turning point for our women cricketers as they have got lot of recognition,” Arothe said. 
 
 He said that when the team reached Mumbai there were thousands of people waiting at the airport to greet them. “Even PM Narendra Modi appreciated the team a lot when we met him on Thursday. He said the team may have lost the game but won people’s hearts. Meeting the PMm who knew each player by her name, was a big booster for the girls. He also spoke in Gujarati for a while,” Arothe, who has been offered coach’s job by BCCI for two more years, said. 
 
 But he doesn’t want to waste much time. “Our eyes are now set on 2018 T20 Women’s World Cup. I have told the girls to relax for some days and then get back to work. After our recent performance, expectations have increased and we need to deliver. Our batting and bowling department is fantastic but players’ physical fitness is one of my major concerns and we will work on it.”
