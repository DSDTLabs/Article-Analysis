AHMEDABAD: After twelve members of the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly received extortion calls and messages over the last month from   — a former aide of underworld don   — a   ex-MLA from Gujarat has now lodged a complaint with city crime branch, for similar calls from an unknown number.

 The former   stated that the caller demanded Rs 15 lakh as protection money and threatened to eliminate his family if the money was not paid.
 
 Senior crime branch officers confirmed that they received such a complaint from a BJP ex-MLA. “We are verifying the details mentioned in the FIR and are investigating the number from which the call was made. Our cyber cell is working on decoding the VoIP call,” said a senior police officer.
 
 This May, twelve MLAs from Uttar Pradesh, mostly from the BJP, lodged different FIRs claiming that they were receiving extortion calls from Ali Budesh, a former   Ibrahim man. “Budesh has fallen out with the D Gang and for five years has not executed criminal activities in India,” said a crime branch official. 
 
 Senior police officers said the ex-MLA contacted them on Wednesday. “According to him, he has been receiving calls from a foreign number. We suspect the call was been made using voice over internet protocol (VoIP). We have located the proxy server and have begun the process to identify the original number that the call was made from,” a top city police officer said.
 
 Police officials said their agencies are in touch with UP police as well. “We are gathering details of their investigation as similar FIRs have been lodged there. UP police even formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT),” said a senior city police officer.
 
 City crime branch is probing more than 50 complaints for extortion calls allegedly made by underworld don Ravi Pujari to politicians, professionals and businessmen. 
 
 No arrests have yet been made for the complaints involving Ravi Pujari.
