MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Friday summoned the state home secretary to know why police cover to constitutional posts like the governor, chief minister, judges and ministers is sought to be reviewed. The court heard a public interest litigation by advocate   for recovery of police   dues from private persons including builders. It had earlier questioned why public money was being wasted on private persons and those politically affiliated.

 The government’s lawyer submitted that the policy is being reviewed and suggestions called from director general of police and the revenue department. But judges were miffed to read a letter by joint secretary (home)   to the DGP for review of police protection. “We are not concerned with constitutional posts. We never said constitutional posts like cabinet ministers and other heads are not to have security. Several times we repeated and yet, he writes that the committee will consider whether they should be granted protection,” said the bench. The judges said the letter “seems to be very mischievous” and gives an impression that it is an order of the court.
 
 The bench questioned if Deshmukh was standing to lose something. “Is it a lack of understanding or intentional? We’ll initiate contempt against him. It is very dangerous if such people are there. Where would the security of the State go? You can't have officers who don't understand court proceedings and issues,” it added.
 
 Told that the chief minister is in-charge of the home department, the judges reacted: “Let him know how his home department works. We are very disturbed with this joint secretary. A joint secretary cadre person writing such thing.” They also said, “We don’t mind paying for security. Let them increase our salaries or give an allowance for it.” The secretary (home)   met the chief justice in her chamber during the court recess.
