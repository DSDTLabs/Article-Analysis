 The businessman had arrived at Alibaug in a vehicle with a friend to buy the land, which had a market value of Rs 1 crore, for Rs 80 lakh. “The businessman said around six unidentified men stopped them, forced them to go to another spot on the   road and looted Rs 40 lakh in new Rs 2,000 notes,“ said Sonake.
