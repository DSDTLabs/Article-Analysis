MUMBAI: A 55-year-old man who   a ticket checker for failing to get a   on a Mumbai-Hyderabad   in 2000 has been convicted and fined Rs 3,500. Shivsharan Birajdar had moved the sessions court in 2012, after he was found guilty and convicted by the magistrate court. The sessions court upheld the conviction on Wednesday. 

 Vasantrao Shinde, who had registered a complaint with the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway police station, said that on April 20, 2000, he was assigned the AC coach of the Hussain Sagar Express, from CST to Pune. He further said that at 9.20pm, he headed to a booth on platform 8 to collect the reservation chart. The accused entered the booth and arrogantly asked him why one out of two wait-listed tickets was unconfirmed. Shinde said he tried to pacify the accused by explaining that even the seats for those on RAC (reservation against cancellation) were yet to be assigned. 
 
 The victim alleged that the accused even threatened to burn the train and assaulted him. After cops investigated the case, a chargesheet was filed. Included were medical papers showing injuries suffered by Shinde. 
 
 In the appeal submitted before the sessions court, the accused denied the allegations. But the court held that Shinde’s evidence showed that he was assaulted and obstructed as a public servant from discharging his duty. “Being an injured witness, he stands on a higher pedestal and unless shown to be wholly unworthy of credence, his evidence cannot be easily brushed aside,” the court said.
 
 It held that Shinde would not want to let his actual assailant go unpunished only to falsely implicate the accused, who was unknown to him. “More particularly, no previous enmity was claimed and he had no axe to grind against the accused,” the court said.
