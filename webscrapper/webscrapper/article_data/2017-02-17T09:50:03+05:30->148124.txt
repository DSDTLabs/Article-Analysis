MUMBAI: If a new design is accepted by the BEST committee, the landmark ‘red’  , will soon change to white with yellow stripes. Five students of JJ Institute of Applied Art, along with their professor, have designed a new look and logo for the BEST buses. The BEST has got approval from the state transport department to ply two buses - one AC and another non-AC, painted in the new design on an ‘experimental basis’ for six months.

 “There is a nostalgic value attached to the red colour and revamping it was a challenge. So, we decided to use a colour that will appear peaceful in the chaotic landscape of Mumbai,” said Santosh Kshirsagar, dean of the institute. The BEST symbol of the bulb and the front-view of the BEST bus were also designed by professors from the institute in 1960s. Kanchan Gokhale, Pallavi Shedge, Samrusdhhi Varade, Rajat Bhele and   have worked on the project. Gokhale said that white is a politically neutral colour and is also most visible.
