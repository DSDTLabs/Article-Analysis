KOCHI: A protest programme was organized by   Pensioners' Welfare Association against the delay in implementing the seventh central pay commission report for employees and pensioners of commodity boards.“Pay commission reports 1to 6 were implemented for the pensioners and employees of boards along with central government employees. However, the seventh pay commission report was not implemented in the case of employees and pensioners of central commodity boards and autonomous bodies,“ said president of the association  .“Representations and memorandum at various levels repeatedly have not resulted in any positive results,“ he said.

 “Two months agp, Central finance ministry issued orders making the report applicable to statutory boards and autonomous bodies also. But administrative ministries like the ministry of commerce have not yet cleared and issued orders to autonomous bodies and commodity boards under their administrative control. This dharna is for drawing their attention for immediate action and redressal of our grievances,“ he added.
 
 The commodity boards include boards like Spices Board, Rubber Board, Coffee Boards, Tea Board, Tobacco Board, MPEDA, APEDA and other organizations totaling above 600, covering around two lakhs of employees and pensioners.
