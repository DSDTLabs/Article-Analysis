Mumbai: The country’s largest home loan company   has reported a net profit of Rs 1,701 crore for the quarter ended December 2016, up 12% from Rs 1,521 crore in the corresponding quarter in FY16.

 The loan book at the end of the quarter stood at Rs 2,86,876 crore. Individual loan disbursements grew by 14% during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 with growth slightly dented by demonetisation. On a consolidated basis the corporation’s net profit rose nearly 13% to Rs 2,729 crore from Rs 2,419 crore in the third quarter of FY16.
 
 The asset quality worsened gross non-performing assets, rising to over 0.8% (Rs 2,341 crore in absolute terms) compared with 0.72% in the year-ago period. The company’s share price closed almost flat at Rs 1,369 after touching the day’s high of Rs 1,378 in the  .
 
 Speaking to TOI, vice-chairman and CEO   said that the worst of demonetisation appeared to be behind, with January 2017 seeing much better customer applications compared to December 2016. According to Mistry, the interest subvention scheme, announced by the Prime Minister on December 31, has the potential to boost housing across the country. “The impact of these schemes would be much more than an increase in the tax breaks because it will have a much larger reach,” Mistry said.
 
 Modi had announced a 4-percentage-point interest subsidy on home loans up to Rs 9 lakh and 3 percentage points on loans up to Rs 12 lakh. Those willing to construct houses or expand their existing houses will get an interest subsidy of 2% for loans up to Rs 2 lakh.He said that demonetisation has not impacted demand for home loans. “It was not as much of a drop in demand as a holding back of purchases in anticipation of a price drop,” said Mistry. He added that there was not much scope for a general drop in prices but there could be a correction in the high-end market given the supply.
 
 Following demonetisation banks have intensified the rate war in home loans. However, Mistry said that not much has changed in competition in the last three quarters. “Banks have dropped their lending rates and our cost of funds has also come down,” said Mistry.
