MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday adjourned a case against actor Dhanush to March 19, which stated that the actor allegedly committed perjury, for which he should be prosecuted.

 The court’s registry listed the case filed by the couple -  , 65, and his wife  , 53, of Madurai who are still claiming that the actor is their son - to decide whether the couple can file such a case before the court.
 
 The couple had already filed a case before the judicial magistrate court in   in Madurai seeking maintenance from the actor by claiming that he is their son. Against it, the actor filed a case before the high court bench. Justice P N Prakash on April 21 last year quashed the couple’s plea declaring that the couple had not made out a prima facie case for trial and their petition was devoid of merits.
 
 Now, the couple filed a plea before the bench saying that the bench quashed their plea based on the documents - birth certificate and school transfer certificate, produced by the actor. tnn
