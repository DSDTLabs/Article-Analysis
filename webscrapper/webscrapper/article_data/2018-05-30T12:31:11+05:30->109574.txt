AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday directed   collector and the district development officer (DDO) to explain the urgency in demolishing 40 shops and cabins in Sardhar village panchayat and what prevented them from waiting for two days till the court hears the case.

 
 
 Justice Biren Vaishnav sought a report from the officials after shop owners complained that though the demolition notices were challenged before the high court, the authorities did not wait till Monday and hurriedly demolished their workplaces on Saturday morning. The shops existed in the village for nearly four decades.
 
 The demolition work was carried out by the village panchayat at the behest of the sarpanch, who was not authorized for the same, the shop owners claimed before the HC.
 
 The shop owners moved the HC last week after they received demolition notices from the sarpanch. The HC refused to grant urgent hearing and the matter was posted for hearing on Monday. In the meanwhile, the sarpanch razed their establishments when he came to know about the petition. The shop owners approached district collector and DDO urging them not to permit demolition for two days.
 
 The HC has posted the case for hearing on June 11, when the government officials are supposed to explain the haste in demolition drive.
