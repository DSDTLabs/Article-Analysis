A storyteller’s workshop was organised by The   at an art gallery in  . The event turned out to be a treat for the literati as they got to learn a lot of techniques of how to develop a story after getting an idea and the ways to convey it. A slam poet from Mumbai, along with Hussain Haidry, a story-teller and lyricist, who were the mentors for the workshop, conducted several activities for the participants. Post the activities, the mentors short-listed five best writers among all to narrate the story which they wrote on the spot. Anooja’s comedy story titled, Vo Naha Ke Chale Gaye left everyone in splits.
Swati Singh, one of the organisers of the event, was overwhelmed to see the response of the people at the workshop. "I thought it would be a bunch of just 10-12 people at the event. But I am pleasantly surprised to see so many people turning up." The event concluded with several selfies and autographs with the mentors.
