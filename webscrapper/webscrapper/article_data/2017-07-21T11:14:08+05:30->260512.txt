NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Wednesday registered an FIR against Aam Aadmi Party MLA   for allegedly molesting a woman and thrashing her son at their house in southeast Delhi’s Sangam Vihar. 

 According to the complaint, Jarwal and his supporters had allegedly barged inside the woman’s house and thrashed her son, accusing him of attacking an AAP supporter during the civic polls. When the woman tried to intervene, Jarwal allegedly touched her inappropriately. Cops registered a   of   and criminal intimidation against Jarwal after conducting a preliminary inquiry with the locals in the area.
 
 However, reacting to the FIR, Jarwal said that this was a politically motivated case. “The lady who has filed the complaint is a BJP volunteer. During the municipal elections, her husband and son had misbehaved with our candidate, who then went on to become the councillor. She has even registered a complaint against her husband but the police never filed an FIR in that case,” said Jarwal.
