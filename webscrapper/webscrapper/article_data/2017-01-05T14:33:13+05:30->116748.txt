If the ongoing meeting with producers, exhibitors and distributors is successful, the almost three-week old film strike in Malayalam cinema will come to a close. This time around, however, exhibitor's federation president   won't be included in the meeting. Grapevine says that all parties involved want the strike to end somehow, except Liberty Basheer, who is stubbornly holding on to the new demand, 50% of the profits from theatres. 
For the past three weeks, no Malayalam films have released in Kerala, neither have any new films started production. While Mohanlal starrer Munthirivallikal Thalirkkumbol and Dulquer starrer Jomonte Suvishengal are in the pipeline, Aamir Khan's   was released widely across the State.
