NEW DELHI: Controversial arms dealer   has been declared an absconder by a court here, paving the way for Delhi police to seek his extradition. He is believed to be hiding in London.

 Sources confirmed to TOI that Bhandari was declared a “proclaimed offender” by the court of chief metropolitan magistrate Deepak Sehrawat at Patiala House Courts. The development comes days after the defence ministry suspended all business dealings with Bhandari’s firm,  , for six months.
 
 According to police, the proclamation proceedings were initiated after Bhandari did not respond to the nonbailable warrant issued against him last year.
