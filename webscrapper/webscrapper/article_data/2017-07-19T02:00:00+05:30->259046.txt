PATNA: After heavy rainfall in early July leading to rise in water level of different rivers, hot and dry weather is being witnessed in most parts of the state, especially the state capital, for the last few days. Weathermen said the state is unlikely to receive significant rainfall before July 22 as the synoptic weather features are not supporting the  .

 Met department had earlier predicted monsoon revival by July 19, triggered by a low pressure trough developing over Bay of Bengal. The trough was expected to move towards Bihar causing widespread rainfall. However, it moved south towards Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, leading to dry spell in the state.
 
 “Normal monsoon was expected in the state this year with total seasonal rainfall at 96% of the long period average. However, certain synoptic features are proving unsupportive for the monsoon winds,” state Met scientist Anand Shankar said. “Storm activities were reported in southeast and south central Bihar on July 17 indicating that the monsoon winds are moving towards the northern side of the state,” he added.
 
 Although the entire state has been facing hot and dry weather, moderate rainfall is being recorded at isolated places in northeast and south Bihar. According to IMD officials, the entire state may again start witnessing fairly widespread rainfall after July 22 due to a favourable monsoon trough line formation.
 
 The state witnessed 14% excess rainfall till July 12. Met sources said 353.2 mm of monsoon rainfall has already been recorded in the state, which is 2% more than normal.
