BHOPAL: Next time if there is a problem in your smart phone, be cautious before handing it over to the company's service centre. 

 The issue is in focus since an incident, the first in the city, came to light on Monday. A 16-year-old girl's private pictures were fraudulently obtained by a service centre executive when she went to get her mobile repaired. The 28-year-old accused allegedly accessed her intimate photographs.
 
 The accused started sending obscene messages to the victim girl, a student of Class 11, and demanded Rs 20,000 or else threatened that he would share the photographs on the social media platforms. 
 
 The girl told her friends and parents about her ordeal and then called the man at Lalghati Square on pretext of discussing the matter. Her friends and kin then nabbed the accused. They thrashed him and handed him over to Koh-E-Fiza police on Monday night. Koh-e-Fiza police arrested the accused and registered a case on charges of extortion and molestation against him under relevant sections of IPC and POCSO Act.
 
 According to police, a few days back, the victim had some trouble in her smart phone after which she took it to company's service centre at Bairagarh. Later, she began to receive obscene messages from accused Shadab Ahmed Khan, 28, a resident of Regiment Road in Shahjehanabad locality. 
 
 He started threatening her that he had some of her intimate photographs and built pressure on her to meet him otherwise he would share it on social media platforms and defame her. When she protested he threatened to kill her and started stalking her.
