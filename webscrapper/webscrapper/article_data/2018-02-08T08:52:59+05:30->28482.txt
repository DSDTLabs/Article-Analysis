LUCKNOW: Three out of four children and teenagers in the 1-19 year age group in Uttar Pradesh have worms in their stomach, according to data from the health department shared ahead of National Deworming Day. 

 Worms in the stomach have been identified as the chief reason for iron deficiency anaemia. To counter the problem in 28 affected disticts, the state health department would be distributing free deworming tablets in all the schools and anganwadi centers on February 10. "Data shows that 76% children in state have worms in their stomach which can be treated with Albendazole tablet. On February 10, the tablets would be given to children in schools and anganwadi centers," said Pankaj Kumar, mission director, National Health Mission, UP. Experts pointed out that India had the highest number of soil-transmitted helminthes - the most common infection worldwide. 
 
 "Worm infestation contributes to iron deficiency which, in turn, leads to poor brain development," said Dr Ashutosh, secretary,  , UP. "It is responsible for malnutrition, anaemia, overall development and recurrent abdominal pain."
 
 Worm infestation is also associated with stunting. Data from the Rapid Assessment Survey shows that in UP, over 50% of children are stunted while another 28.4% are severely stunted. 
 
 Districts to be covered in the programme include Agra, Aligarh, Baghpat, Bijnore, Badaun, Bulandshahr, Chandauli, Etah, Etawah, Firozabad, Noida, Ghaziabad, Hapur and Jhansi.
