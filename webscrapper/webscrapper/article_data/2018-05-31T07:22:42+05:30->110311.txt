BENGALURU: Born with a hearing disability, Punyakirti B, battled the odds to score 64.2% in the CBSE Class 10 exams.

 When she was about a yearand-a-half, her parents Sathyanveshini JS and Basanth Kumar realised their daughter was not responding to any noise and later learnt that she had a hearing disability. About eight years ago, she underwent a cochlear implant surgery and started hearing with speedy recovery. Later, she underwent speech therapy for one year.
 
 
 Dr Sunil Dutt, clinical director, ENT, head of  , Apollo Hospitals, who operated on Punyakirti, said, “I am pleased to see her perform well in the CBSE exams. Her parents’ dedication towards her overall development is commendable.”
 
 Punyakirti, who had initially studied in a special school, joined The Smart School, Machohalli, after the surgery. She has also proved her mettle as an athlete, bagging 10 medals so far. She wants to pursue a career in commerce, but more than that, she aims to represent India at national and international levels in sports. “I had a practice session in sports from 5pm to 7pm every day, after which I would study from 8pm to 11pm,” she added.
 
 “All that differently abled children need is time and encouragement. I never let her lose self-confidence,” said her mother Sathyanveshini.
