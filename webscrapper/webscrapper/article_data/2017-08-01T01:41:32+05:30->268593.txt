THANE: Investigators probing the   reportedly stumbled upon a   used by the scammers to   with dispensing units using a remote control.

 It is learnt that a petrol pump in Nagpur resorted to remote control tampering of the electronic fuel dispensing machine as was done in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 “The previous raids saw that the pulsars (device present in the units) were tampered with by making some changes in them. In a recent raid we saw that an external device was attached to it to manage the dispensing of the fuel. We came across eight pulsar units whose wires were attached to an external device which could be controlled by a remote. The same technique was used by the accused to tamper with fuel stations in Uttar Pradesh. We came across 200ml less fuel being dispensed against five litres at this pump,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Abhishek Trimukhe.
 
 The police claimed that they have raided around 161 fuel stations till now and came across 90   which were dispensing less fuel.
 
 “We have raided pumps in 18 districts and arrested 24 persons, including a technician, Riyaz Mulani, who was picked up on Saturday and has been sentenced to police custody till August 2. The remaining 23 accused are in judicial custody. Mulani had bought some pulsars from arrested accused Vivek Shetye to sell them to a few fuel stations in the state. Shetye was arrested over a month ago for developing software for tampering with the dispensing units.
 
 Before the recent raid in Nagpur, the police said that they had come across four types of tampering. The accused used to tamper with the equipment in the fuel stations like the pulsar, which is an equipment inside the machine, the control card, keypad or the software.
