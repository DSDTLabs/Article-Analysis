After the rooftops of two buildings collapsed in   in February, the   (NDMC) is more cautious than ever about the structural safety of the buildings in the area. The restaurants and retailers were asked for structural safety certificate that had to be submitted to the   and now, as a per a recent report, the municipal council has rejected 25 applications for running restaurants, cafes and other eateries in CP. 

  Out of 100 applications which were received in the last two months for grant or renewal of licence, 25 of them have been rejected, said an official in a report. "Earlier, buildings which did not have fire or structural stability certificates, were served notices and reminders were sent to complete the required documentation while they continued to operate. But now it has been decided that no provisional licences will be issued and if no certificates are submitted, the licence will not be granted or renewed," the official was quoted as saying.
 
  The NDMC has also sealed rooftops of 21 restaurants and several rounds of discussions have happened in the last few months between the officials of the civic body and restaurateursâ€™ association."A group of restaurateurs had a meeting with NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar last week and they had a detailed discussion on the issue of running operations on the rooftops which are sealed at present. They have been told that NDMC is drafting a plan for rooftop restaurants in CP and will be sharing the same soon with restaurants. If both bodies agree, some decision can be taken about running rooftop operations," says a source.
