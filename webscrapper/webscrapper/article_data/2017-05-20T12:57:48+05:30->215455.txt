AURANGABAD: A one-year-old proposal of the   to spend Rs 1.15 crore for   guards is likely to see light of the day in coming days. The   ( ) officials on Friday said the proposal is in its final stage.

 The civic body had planned to spend the said amount on tree guards in the last season, but due to financial constraints and some technical reasons they could not procure the material.
 
 “We have already received bids from various suppliers and a work order will be issued to them very soon,” AMC garden superintendent   said.
 
 He added that the proposal got delayed last season because of poor response from the suppliers. “We had floated tenders in November-December 2016, but no one came forward. However, in the second attempt made in April 2017, enough suppliers responded and now the process finalizing an agency is going on,” Patil said, adding that the tree guards would be made available in monsoon.
 
 The authorities have decided to buy tree guards made of steel and fibre. “Some of the corporators were in favour of fibre tree guards while other wished to have guards made of steel. Accordingly, we are buying both the types,” he said.
 
 Patil said all the 115 corporators would be allotted fixed quota of tree guards. On an average the civic body needs more than 2,000 tree guards every year, but for the past few years, the authorities could supply less than 200 tree guards annually.
 
 In the backdrop of deficit rainfall and subsequent water scarcity in the city, the AMC has decided to undertake tree plantation on a large scale with the active support from citizens. For 2017-18, the municipal body has set a target of planting about 30,000 saplings.
 
 The civic body carries out tree planation drives all across the city, but the survival rate is less than 30% because of water scarcity and lack of tree guards. However, for the upcoming season, the authorities claimed to have done systematic planning.
