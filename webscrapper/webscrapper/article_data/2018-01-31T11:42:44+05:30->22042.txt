The clock rolled back in Bengaluru on Monday evening, as a fleet of charming vintage cars lined the streets of the city, with lovers of these classic beauties cheering on. The vintage parade witnessed as many as 50 classic cars and motorcycles that drove through Head Post Office, Palace Road and Thimmaiah Circle, ending the tour at Cubbon Park. 1936 Lanchester Straight 8, 1940 Lincoln-Zephyr, 1945 Buick, Vauxhall, Chevrolet Impala, Chevrolet Street Master, Jaguar and Mustang were among the cars that turned heads during the rally.
 “Historic vehicles are finding a new presence in the hearts of Bengalureans, and it is a welcome trend. It’s not just a thing among the old-timers anymore. Even young enthusiasts in the city are passionate about vintage car restoration works and maintenance. At a time when modern luxury motors are seen zooming around Bengaluru, there is a lot of sentimental attachment towards these automotives too, which is, precisely, also the reason we still get to see a good number of vintage cars on the streets of the city. But what’s most remarkable about it is that an increasing number of women car enthusiasts are seen behind the wheels of these classic beauties. So, it’s more than just nostalgia – it is a treasure trove for motorists,” says vintage car collector  .
