GHAZIABAD:   is causing respiratory illnesses among residents of Indirapuram’s Ahimsa Khand 2. 

 The residents claim the dust is generated from a stone-crushing unit near the locality which was relocated from Noida around three years ago.
 
 D K Maurya, president, Federation of Apartment Owners Association (FedAOA), said the members met the district magistrate, Nidhi Kesarwani, on March 16 demanding a solution to the problem.
 
 Maurya, who is from Niho Scottish Gardens, said all the residential societies in the locality have been affected by the   He said FedAOA would be filing a case at the NGT soon.
 
 The residents from Niho Scottish Greens, one of the worst-hit residential societies in the locality because of its proximity to the unit, also met the   officials in this regard last year but to no avail.
 
 When contacted, Kesarwani told TOI that the additional district magistrate has been told to launch a probe into the issue. 
 
 “We have to check the details about the land where the unit is being run. It is possible that the stone-crushing unit had been running for a long time and the residential areas were set up later,” Kesarwani said. 
 
 However, Maurya said the stone-crushing unit was relocated a few years ago, possibly after the NGT’s intervention. 
 
 He added that FedAOA would urge the NGT to look into the matter.
 
 Highlighting another concern, Anil Sharma, a member of Apartment Owners Association, Ashiana Greens, another residential area, said, “Trucks from the unit continue to ply on the newly constructed Hindon-Pusta road, because of which residents avoid the road and take the narrower arterial roads of the residential area.
