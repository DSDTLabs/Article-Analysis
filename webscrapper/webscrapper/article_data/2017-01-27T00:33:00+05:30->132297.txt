PUNE: The education department has decided to review the work of all Sainik schools in the state. The main aim of the exercise is to see whether the schools were fulfilling the purpose for which they were started, that is, of sending maximum number of students to  .

 “A committee under the commissioner of education has been formed to carry out the review work. A government resolution to this effect has been released,” said  , director of secondary education. 
 
 “There are nearly 30 Sainik schools in the state. We will visit all the schools and examine the quality of education and infrastructure, among other things. A report will then be submitted to the education ministry for further action,” a senior official of education department said.
 
 Pooja Jog, principal of Rani Laxmibai Girls Military School, Pirangut, said the biggest hurdle the girls from Sainik schools face is that they don’t have direct entry to defence institutes after passing standard XII. “Boys have direct entry to   after they complete Class XII, but that is not the case with girls as they have to complete their graduation and only then can appear for Combined Defence Services Examination. Till they are in school, they live in a very militarized set up, but when they go for graduation, they get diverted to other fields, hence the number is small,” Jog added.
 
 The school was started in 1997, and till now nine girls have joined Armed Services. Men candidates can join at the rank of Jawans after completing Std XII, an option that women don’t have. “The only option is to apply for   where students are trained for three years and are given BSc nursing degree and posted as nursing officers,” Jog said
 
 The committee will also review the syllabus of Sainik schools to see if it can be upgraded to the level of Central Board of Secondary Education.
