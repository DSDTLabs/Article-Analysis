New Delhi: A parliamentary committee led by chairman Mukul Roy and several MPs visited the Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday. While the purpose of the visit was to inspect the latest developments at IGI, the committee also inquired about the status of the airport’s Terminal 2 and asked the ministry for civil aviation to ensure that airlines are shifted there ‘as soon as possible’.

 The Transport, Tourism and Culture Parliamentary committee visited both Terminal 1D and Terminal 3 along with the newly renovated Terminal 2. Sources said the committee was happy with the preparedness and the infrastructure of Terminal 2. They, however, asked for the ministry of civil aviation to ensure that airlines are shifted as soon as possible so that the space can be utilised, reducing the burden on Terminal 1D.
 
 The committee members included MPs Ritabrata Banerjee, Kiranmay Nanda, Rajeev Shukla among others. Currently, three airlines — Indigo, SpiceJet and GoAir operate from Terminal 1D. “We have asked the ministry of civil aviation to ensure that the airlines shift to Terminal 2 at the earliest. This will reduce the burden on the existing terminal as it is already up to capacity. The committee has also recommended that commercial utilisation at the terminals is spread out so that there is less congestion and inconvenience for passengers,” said a senior MP and member of the committee.
