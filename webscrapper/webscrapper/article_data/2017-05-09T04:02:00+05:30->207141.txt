AHMEDABAD: The state government while sending a revised proposal for clearing final   around Nalsarovar stated that they had earlier included catchment areas which were not significant. The government shrunk the   range from earlier 2.35 km near limit and 13 km far limit to 1 km near limit and 4.1 km far limit.

  “These non-significant areas have now been excluded from the ESZ area in the revised proposal,” the government told the ESZ expert committee of ministry of environment, forest and climate change.
 
 However, officials said that earlier the 13-km radius of the ESZ had been made to carefully cover catchment for the only Ramsar site in Gujarat, Nalsarovar, and extend it up to  . The officials said that now that the ESZ has been compromised to 4.1 km radius by the government, it may adversely affect flow of water in the lake.
 
 The officials said that the minutes recorded in the 23rd meeting of the ESZ committee held on October 19-20 show that the ministry received no comments on the draft notification. The chairperson of the committee, while clearing the proposal for final notification in October had stated that the state government should promote green skills in the area.
