Every time actor   finds the right words to articulate his thoughts on social media, it has somehow led to a slew of doubts popping on the minds of the much simplistic Malayalis. This time around, it looks like fans are totally perplexed again, when the 'Ennu Ninte Moideen' actor posted, 'As I walk away from the sets of #TIYAAN for one last time..I wonder if it'll be me saying bye to the sets..or Aslan bidding adieu to me. Few characters can stake claim to influencing the actor at a level that is deeper than the self, inner than the conscience. Aslan will have taught me a lot..lessons that I'm sure are left to be discovered in my life henceforth.'

 'It has been a privilege to lend form to what I believe is one of the most complex characters ever written for me, in what is undoubtedly one of Malayalam's biggest ever productions. Thank you #Krishnakumar, #Murali and Mr. Haneef Mohammed of Red Rose Creations, whose conviction is the biggest reason behind the sheer scale of #TIYAAN. And yes..like always..felt like school days..arguing, disagreeing, fighting over pretty much every shot, and then silently acknowledging each other as we watch the shots on the monitor with my brother #IndrajithSukumaran. Oh...and did I mention? #LUCIFER was born on the sets of #TIYAAN (sic).'
 
 What followed was a splurge of funny comments from his followers while deciphering his post that they would have to run for a dictionary or find themselves a better translation of the same.
