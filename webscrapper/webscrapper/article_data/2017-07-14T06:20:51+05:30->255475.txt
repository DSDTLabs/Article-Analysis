HYDERABAD: Officers of the legal   in the city are an overburdened lot, with an acute   plaguing the department in Hyderabad and as well as other districts in the state. 

 Officials in the department and experts outside feel that the government would only benefit if the staff requirement is met. Elaborating on this, Srinivas Loksatha, president of Confederation of All Telangana Consumer Organisation ( ), said, "If there are sufficient inspection officers, there will be frequent inspections at establishments to keep a check on the violation of   rates. The money generated by penalties would come back to the government." 
 
 Vimal Babu, deputy collector in legal metrology department, Hyderabad, said the city has nearly 18,000 establishments, which would require as many as 25 officers. "There are just 14 officers in Hyderabad to keep a check on these establishments. Each officer already takes care of nearly 700 establishments. They are being overburdened with work," said Babu. 
 
 Owing to lack of inspections at establishments like malls and restaurants, consumers have been complaining of being cheated on the pretext of charges over MRP rates. "If someone is unaware of the GST rates of certain products they are gullible," said Loksatha. 
 
 He said that filing a case in   is also of no use as judgment takes years to come by. "There are over 4,000 cases that are still awaiting judgment, out of which 70% of cases have been pending for over four years. This is again due to shortage of staff in district consumer forum. Forums should dispose cases within 90 days, but cases have been pending for years," said Vijay Gopal, a city based anti-corruption activist. 
 
 The state appointed 10 district consumer   presidents for 12 forums. Still, 18 district forum member posts are vacant, said officials.
