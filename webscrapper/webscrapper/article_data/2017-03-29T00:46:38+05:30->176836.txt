GURUGRAM: There is no respite from frequent outages in DLF Phase-4 as the mercury continues its upward march. There has been a sudden spike in   in the area, residents say, with the temperature hovering around 37 degree Celsius for the past two days.

 “I was sweating when I woke up at 7am. I could not turn on the air conditioner because of the power cut. I don’t know when the outage started. My neighbours said it happened past -midnight,” said Anil Puri, a resident of lane 13 in DLF Phase 4.
 
 “Is this the right time to snap power? The   is doing it very often nowadays.” said Puri. Residents said only DLF Phase 4 has been facing power outages on a regular basis. “Time and again officials tell us that the outages take place here as we get the supply from the substation in Sector 28, which develops snag very often,” said Aarushi Dixit, a resident of lane 12 in DLF Phase 4. Discom officials cited infrastructure work as the reason for the spike in outages. 
 
 “Owing to the road construction work at Golf Course Road, one of the power lines got cut, triggering outage on Tuesday,” said Kuldeep Nehra, subdivision officer, DLF City. Nehra also said from Wednesday till April 4 there would be four-hour outage in Sushant Lok 1 — from 10 am to 2 pm— to carry out maintenance work on feeders.
