JAIPUR: A 35-year-old consumed poison laced food and also offered it to his wife and brother in which the husband and wife died at Bari town of   of the state on Wednesday while the youth was rushed to hospital in critical condition. 

 According to police, the man identified as   along with his wife Preeti (32) and his brother Rupesh (26) were found in unconscious state. “Their condition suggested that they had some poisonous substance. All the three were rushed to the nearby hospital where Anand Kumar and his wife were   dead while Rupesh was in critical condition,” said a senior police officer. 
 
 Rupesh was rushed to a private hospital in Agra. Police have suspected that illicit relation of Anand’s wife with his brother could be the reason behind the suicide. “We are probing into different angles as it was also found that Anand had taken some loans which he could not pay. But this can’t be a mere reason why the poison-laced food was also served to his brother,” the officer added.
