NEW DELHI: A day after a   hit   in which one man died,   sent a notice to the Delhi Transport Corporation asking seeking help in locating the accused driver. Sources said that he fled to his hometown in UP. 

 DCP (south east) Romil Baaniya said that police have registered a case under Sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC. Later, police may also add stricter sections of culpable homicide. 
 
 Specialised units have also been roped in to arrest the driver, who, officers said, has been evading police like a professional criminal. The bus has been traced to a depot in central Delhi after DTC officials reported the nature of damage caused to the vehicle after it rammed several vehicles.
 
 Eyewitnesses said that the bus, with number plate DL 1L PC 7020, was going towards Tughlaqabad on Ravidas Marg. Driving at a high speed, the driver reportedly lost control and rammed a rickshaw, which was flung into the air. The bus then hit 29-year-old Suraj, a resident of Sangam Vihar, who was on a motorbike. Suraj, who got stuck in the wheels of the bus, was dragged for over a 100m. The bus driver then fled.
 
 People took the rickshaw driver, who had suffered multiple fractures, to AIIMS Trauma Centre while Suraj was taken to the Majeedia Hospital where he later succumbed.
 
 Police officers said that they have got the CCTV footage of the area to identity the accused. They have also asked DTC to provide them information about the bus and the driver. The capitalâ€™s border check posts have also been alerted and teams have been sent to possible hideouts outside Delhi to trace the accused.
