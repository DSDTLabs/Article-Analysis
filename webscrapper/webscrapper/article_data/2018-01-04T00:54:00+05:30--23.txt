Mangaluru: Hours after the Pilikula water amusement park incident, where two girls and two boys were thrashed by saffron chauvinists , a Facebook page ‘Veera Kesari’ has justified the act.

 The post says that physical assault is the last resort to stop Hindu girls roaming with boys of other religions which results in love jihad. The post, which has gone viral on social media, added that the recent developments in society are paving way for destruction of religious and cultural values. Such incidents could have avoided, if we (Hindus) had religious education in place.
 
 Further, it warned girls in and around Moodbidri not to roam with youths of other religion, or else they will face the music. “You may have hundred reasons to roam with the boys of opposite religion, but we don’t need those explanations. We have advised you enough,” it stated, adding that there are youths at Moodbidri’s prominent college to keep an eye on such developments.
 
 “We have learnt that many girls who go to far-off places on tours are roaming with Muslim boys. Giving excuses of photo-shoot, some of them are going out with boys. In coming days if we find girls roaming with boys of other religion, we will beat the girls more than the boys,’’ the post warned.
 
 The post also said that it is not just a social media post but enough preparations have been made to implement the plan.
