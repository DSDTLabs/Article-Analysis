MARGAO: Fatorda MLA and minister for town and country planning, Vijai  , on Monday maintained that   would witness just one   celebration. 

 He also claimed credit for unifying the two rival Shigmotsav committees.
 
 Sardesai, along with several   (MMC) councilors and members of the Margao Shigmotsav Samiti 2018, offered the traditional coconut to Lord  , the presiding deity of the city, at Pimplapedd, to mark the commencement of the Shigmo festival. 
 
 Shigmo celebrations will be held under the aegis of the MMC. Yatin Phaldessai is heading the Margao Shigmotsav Committee. The float parade will be held on March 4 along the Opinion Poll square to   road route. However, with no official word from the rival group over a reconciliation, as claimed by Sardesai, it remains to be seen if the MLAâ€™s attempts have brought about a rapprochement.
 
 Over the last several years, while the Shigmotsav committee affiliated to the ruling party enjoyed state patronage for the official parade, the rival group would have a modest celebration.
