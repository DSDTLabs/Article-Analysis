Broken, battered and bruised – that's how the participants at the Devil's Circuit, a course with 15 military-style obstacles, described their experience in Noida on Sunday. It was a fun-filled Sunday in which the participants watched their bosses fall, supervisors cry and colleagues fail at various challenging obstacles.

 The racers had started flocking to the run from 6am, and over 8,000 people participated in the event, held near the   Expressway. Since most of the participants were corporate employees, office politics and gossip was inevitable. Vipul*, a corporate executive who works in Gurgaon, said, "I never imagined that I would get a chance to see my boss and seniors get down and dirty or crawl under a wire. I used to think that my supervisor was a strong woman, as she used to brag about her adventure trips, but surprisingly, she started crying when assigned to walk across the Burma Bridge. Ask anybody and they will tell you that it’s the easiest task."

 Pulkit*, a sales manager who works in Noida, said, "I still can't get over the fact that I swam across the giant ice tub. Every time I wanted to give up, I thought of my office crush, who was cheering for me. I wanted to make a good impression, so I dunked myself in ice-cold water. It was all worth it when she said, 'I always knew you could do it.'"

 Nikhil Kumar, a sports enthusiast, said, 'I have run many marathons, and though I never finished them, I've realized how boring they are. The obstacle run was fun and it was good to see people fail at it. It was great fun watching the gym bhakts and fitness enthusiasts in my office shy away from doing a certain drill." Priyanka Gupta, an HR manager, said, "We crawled, jumped and ran. It was so much fun. I really liked mud crawling. It was all about challenging yourself. In future, I will participate in more such events to increase my stamina."
