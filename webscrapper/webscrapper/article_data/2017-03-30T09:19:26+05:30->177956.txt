PATIALA: Punjab is likely to miss the March 31 deadline set by   for submitting a detailed plan of action to implement its February 22 order in which it had made it clear that industrial units releasing untreated effluents into drains should be shut down.

 In the order, the apex court had asked the state government to submit reports with regard to setting up common effluent   (CETPs). For this, the local civic bodies were to formulate norms to levy cess on users, so that the existing treatment remained operational.
 
 These norms were to be finalized by state local bodies department by March 31. However, the state authorities are yet to formulate the norms and submit them to the   (NGT).
 
 Sources revealed that no such plan was likely to be submitted due to the “short deadline” and the government would try to seek an extension. Punjab additional chief secretary (local bodies) D P Reddy could not be contacted for comment despite repeated attempts.
 
 The Supreme Court had also underlined that in case the norms were not laid out, Punjab government would have to bear the cost of running the CETPs.
 
 When contacted,   (PPCB) chairperson Manpreet Singh Chatwal said it was for the local civic bodies to decide the norms. He, however, said the board was already working to set up four CETPs across Punjab and four such plants were already operational.
 
 Chatwal said smaller industrial units found it unviable to install individual treatment plants, and it had come to the fore in the past that such factories discharged most untreated industrial effluents. “With the new CETPs, this problem will be curtailed to a great extent,” he said.
 
 In its February 22 orders, the Supreme Court had made installation of effluent treatment plants at all industrial units in Punjab mandatory for which a three month period was given to them.
