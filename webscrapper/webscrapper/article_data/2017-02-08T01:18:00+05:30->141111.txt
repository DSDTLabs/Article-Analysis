Mumbai:   leader Ajit Pawar on Tuesday claimed the late   stalwart Gopinath Munde wanted to join the   along with his loyalist MLAs, but his plan couldn’t take off as then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh advised him against engineering a “split”. 

 “Munde, who was the deputy leader in the Lok Sabha then, was ready to quit the BJP and join Congress, along with legislators like Pasha Patel, Madhuri Misal, Prakash Shendge, Pankaja Munde who too were ready to quit (BJP),” Ajit Pawar told a channel. 
 
 “Sushma Swaraj persuaded Gopinath Munde from leaving the party. BJP leaders like Devendra Fadnavis, Vinod Tawde and Sudhir Mungantiwar worked to ensure that no MLA quit the party,” he added.
