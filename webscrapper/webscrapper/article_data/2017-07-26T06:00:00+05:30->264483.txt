It was a fun evening for the members of a city   as they gathered for their annual ‘social meet’ recently. 

 The do kick-started with a ramp walk where the members sashayed the ramp with poise and confidence. It was followed by a musical night where artistes from Mumbai performed live. Later, everybody took to the dance 
 floor to shake a leg while a few preferred to sing. With good food, music and lots of masti, it sure was an evening to remember.
