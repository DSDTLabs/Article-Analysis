NAGPUR:   users who could not use the facility for about six months are going to be deprived of it yet again.   (NIT) has decided to close the Olympic size pool for some days for upgrade. This is against the spirit of judgment of Nagpur bench of   as the court had given six months time to the civic agency to  .

 A NIT official said that Rs8 crore would be spent on upgrade. “Four works will be done under the renovation project. A new filtration plant and ozonization plant will be installed. Underwater lights will be fitted in the pools and related plumbing will be done. The last is replacement of tiles and some other civil work,” he said.
 
 “The work order for ozonization plant and tile replacement has been issued. The one for the remaining two works will be out this week. We will then summon our architect from Nasik, who will prepare a work plan. We will try to keep at least one pool open and complete the work as fast as possible. In winter not many people use the pool and hence this is the best season for doing the job,” he added.
 
 In 2014, NIT had decided to construct a sports complex besides the swimming pool. The pool users moved the Nagpur HC against the decision. The HC directed the NIT to close the pool for six months and carry out whatever renovation and expansion it wanted within this period. Later chief minister   on request of swimming enthusiasts stayed the sports complex. NIT only did half-hearted renovation and opened the pool some days before the HC deadline.
 
 Nilesh Jog, a regular pool user, demanded that NIT should not close down the main pool for renovation. “Only the filtration plant needs to be changed. NIT should first install the ozone plant and then dismantle the existing one. There is no need to close down any pool. The question arises as to what the agency did in the six months given to it by the HC. Why was the filter not replaced during that period? Only the tiles of the showers were changed,” he said.
