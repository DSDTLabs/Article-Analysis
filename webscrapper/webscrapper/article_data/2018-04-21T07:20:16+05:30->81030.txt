 Srinivasa Rao had married Sunitha 10 years ago. Recently, he was sacked unceremoniously from his job in a private company in the city. He later told police that he felt humiliated after his friends and family came to know about the incident and so he decided to leave town for a few days.
 
 On April 12, he and his family reached Tirupati to offer prayers and checked into a hotel. An argument soon ensued between Sunitha and Srinivas and he expressed disappointment that his sacking had become known among his friends and family. Upset, he decided to end his life after killing his family. He piked their drinks with sedatives ans smothered them with a pillow.
 
 But after killing them, he could not summon enough courage to take his own life. He left the bodies in the hotel room. Guilt-ridden on Friday, he approached the Alipiri police and confessed to the crime.
 
 Cops reached the hotel and found the bodies in the room. They sent the bodies to the government hospital for postmortem. “We are investigating his claims and awaiting the postmortem exam report to ascertain the real cause of death,” Alipiri CI said. A case was registered under Section 302 ( ) of IPC.
