NEW DELHI: The father of an Indian shooter who is part of the CWG squad got unauthorised access to the athletes’ lounge at the Belmont shooting centre, leading to an unpleasant situation. The lounge is only accessible to accredited coaches and support staff, apart from the team members.

 
 
 
 The incident happened after India’s chef-de-mission,   got accreditation for  , father of double trap shooter Varsha, apparently because of their old friendship. As some of the Indian shooters saw Varsha accompanied by her father at the lounge area, they complained about it to National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) president  . The accreditation said that Vinay was Varsha’s personal coach.
 
 
 
 Raninder promptly asked Vinay to leave the lounge area, which he did immediately. NRAI chief later took to the twitter to express his dismay over the way IOA granted Varsha’s father the accreditation without even consulting the federation.
 
  
 
 “He was not on the NRAI list and nor is he an IOA official/member. His getting the accreditation which includes access to even the athletes’ area defies logic. The accreditation has been facilitated by the Chef de mission of the Indian contingent. On what grounds I cannot say,” tweeted Raninder. In a separate tweet, he added: “We are aware and am personally conducting a thorough investigation into it.” The controversy prompted top IOA officials to seek an explanation from Sisodia.
