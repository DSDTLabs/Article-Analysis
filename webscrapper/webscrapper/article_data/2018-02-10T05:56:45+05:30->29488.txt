NAGPUR: In a major threat to residents around the   dumping yard, huge heaps of municipal solid waste once again caught fire, this time barely 200-300 meters away from the houses.

 Even as fire tenders struggled to extinguish the fire, which reportedly broke out on Thursday, residents complained of severe breathing problems. They said the fire broke out on the side of  , ahead of Mahagenco’s sewage treatment plant.
 
 On Friday afternoon, the entire stretch of Bidgaon Road was engulfed in thick, foul-smelling cloud of smoke. Though   (NMC) had permanently deployed a fire tender at Bhandewadi, municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal on Friday increased the number of tenders to four. “The chief fire officer is handling the situation. If needed, we are prepared to put in additional resources for mitigation,” Mudgal told TOI.
 
 While many residents blamed ragpickers for the fire, a section of people said it was natural. NMC officials said that the fire was caused due to organic decomposition process.
 
 Members of NGO Green Vigil Foundation, who went to the spot, suspected that the fire was man-made. “For natural fires to ignite in a dumping yard, the temperature has to be quite high. Such kind of a massive fire cannot be natural in this weather condition,” said founder of Green Vigil Kaustav Chatterjee. He added that there are two sewage treatment plants (STPs) nearby, and the treated water should be used to fight the fire.
 
 While fires at the dump yard in summers were common, this is the fourth fire of this winter. In December, the dumping yard had caught fire twice in a span of 20 days.
 
 Residents said that the pollution situation is the worst they have ever seen. “The air feels toxic. Because of winters, the smog is not dispersing. People have started falling sick,” they said.
