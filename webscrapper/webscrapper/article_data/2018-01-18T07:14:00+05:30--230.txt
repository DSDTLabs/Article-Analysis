Gurgaon: The Gurgaon sessions court on Wednesday extended judicial remand of the Class XI student detained for the September 8, 2017 murder of a seven-year-old boy inside a school campus in Gurgaon’s Bhondsi area for another 14 days. The juvenile (referred to as Bholu as per a court order) will remain at an observation home in Faridabad till January 31.

 The next hearing in the case is scheduled for January 21, and will be held in-camera. A chargesheet is also expected to be filed by the end of this month as the 90-day timeline expires on February 8. The CBI had detained Bholu on November 7 and produced him before the   (JJB) on November 8, from where he was send to remand till November 11. Bholu has been in judicial custody since November 11.
 
 On January 8, additional district sessions court judge JS Kundu, while rejecting the bail application of the juvenile, had barred the media from not only revealing the identity of the juvenile suspect but also the victim, the school, witnesses and anything related to the investigation in the case.
 
 The juvenile’s bail application was first rejected by the JJB in December, and the sessions court later upheld the board’s decision and even imposed a fine of Rs 21,000 on his father for wasting the court’s time.
 
 The juvenile’s counsel, Sandeep Aneja, said, “Judicial custody was extended by another 14 days.” He said only judicial custody of the suspect was extended on Wednesday, and no hearing of the case took place.
