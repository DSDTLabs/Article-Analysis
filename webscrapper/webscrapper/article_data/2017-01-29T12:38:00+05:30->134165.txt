Rohtak: Complying with the orders of the DGP (prisons), Rohtakâ€™s Sunaria jail officials on Saturday tightened the security around the premises to avert any untoward situation in the wake of the Jat agitation for reservation that starts on Sunday.

 Jail superintendent Dayanand Mandola told mediapersons that DGP (prisons) has directed all the district jail superintendents to remain in touch with the superintendent of police and other government officials to keep a tab on developments. Mandola said at present there were 1,446 inmates in Rohtak jail and all the facilities related to essential commodities have been stocked up for next six months.
 
 On security ring, jail superintendent said that keeping the security of inmates and staff in mind, armed police personnel have been deputed on all the three routes leading to the prison. He said that though they were equipped with all the facilities but due to absence of bunkers with roof facilities, the police personnel have been forced to perform their duty under open sky braving cold weather and rainy season.
