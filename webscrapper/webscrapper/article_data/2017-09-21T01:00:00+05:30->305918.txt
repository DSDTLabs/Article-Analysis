CHHAPRA: The installation of high resolution CCTV cameras in at least 32 areas of the town before Durga Puja and Muharram is in its final stage. In the first phase, 16 places have been selected for installation of cameras and separate poles erected for the purpose. The rest 16 will be installed in the second phase.

 Zonal IG Sunil Kumar is likely to inaugurate the control room in the next couple of days to keep a watch on the movement of people through CCTV cameras. 
 
 SP Har Kishore Rai has directed the SHOs of different police stations to convene meetings of the local peace committees and take action against the troublemakers. He has also asked them to physically verify the Puja pandals and the procession routes before granting licences. 
 
 Puja committees, on the other hand, have been told to follow fire safety norms and rules of the State Pollution Control Board, failing which they would be liable for prosecution.
 
 ‘Idol immersion not allowed on Oct 1’: At a meeting of the Aurangabad district administration and police along with representatives of different Durga Puja and Muharram committees on Tuesday, a detailed programme was chalked out for immersion of Durga idols by September 30 midnight.
 
 District magistrate (DM) Kanwal Tanuj said it was decided unanimously that immersion of Durga idols would not be allowed on October 1 as Muharram processions would be taken out that day. “Large number of police personnel will be deployed in sensitive areas like Aurangabad, Kutumba and Daudnagar during the festivals,” the DM added.
 
 At least 532 Durga Puja committees and 544 Muharram committees were registered with the district administration last year. “This time, all organizing committees will once again have to obtain permission from the administration. Those, who fail to do so, will face action,” Tanuj said.
