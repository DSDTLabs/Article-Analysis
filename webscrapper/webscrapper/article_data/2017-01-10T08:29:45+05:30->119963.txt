 “Video data should be stored securely in centralized location. It should be treated as a classified document. All video data from all cameras should be stored without any human intervention, either prior to viewing or while viewing,” the notification said.
 
 A top police official told TOI classified means top secret status. “Public cannot get access of classified document. It cannot be provided under RTI Act too,” he said. The guidelines have come as a relief for civic bodies and police department. Handling of video footage would have been controversial due to lack of guidelines.
 
 NMC and police department would have access to   footage and data. There will be two control rooms, one at NMC head office and other at the office of commissioner of police. Officials will have to be careful that footage does not leak out or they would face action. It may be used only for specified purposes or through specific court orders.
 
 The home department made it clear that the private establishments can have its own set up of CCTVs. Even, bus depots, railway stations, airports, malls, hospitals, hotels etc may have their own systems and their integration to the planned system must be considered.
