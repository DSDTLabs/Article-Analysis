MUMBAI: Students across streams had a gripe about the manner in which assessment took place in the first half of 2017, when  . A total of 84,761 candidates applied for revaluation, 30% more than after the previous exam. The largest count of revaluation applications was from the   (28,019), closely followed by law students (14,493). In all, 4.53 lakh students took the exam. 

 Interestingly, about 73,000 students were wrongly failed in examinations conducted between 2014 and 2016. All passed after revaluation. The university failed to give details of candidates who passed after revaluation in the second half of 2016 and the first semester of 2017.
 
 "Students taking Mumbai University's exams are losing faith in assessment," said RTI activist  . "While 80,000 candidates applied for revaluation in all of 2014, the first half of 2017 has already crossed that application count." 
 
 "It remains to be seen how many students are disgruntled after the second semester exam," Durve said.
 
 The situation is confounding for students who don't receive revaluation results in time and are hence forced to appear for supplementary exams. In several cases, revaluation results are declared after students appear for supplementary exams.
 
 Applications for answer book photocopying too saw a spurt. In the second half of 2016, there were 6,965 such applications. After the first exam of 2017, that number was 18,157. Engineering and law faculties had seen 6,264 and 5,202 applications respectively, the highest among all streams.
 
 "The university should publish model standard answer paper sets and give it to paper checkers and also publish the same on their website," said Durve, who filed the RTI application. 
 
 "MU should also appoint a sufficient number of paper checkers so that there is no pressure on them in terms of time. Payment to paper checkers must be in line with the work. At the same time, strict action must be taken against erring paper checkers," said  .
