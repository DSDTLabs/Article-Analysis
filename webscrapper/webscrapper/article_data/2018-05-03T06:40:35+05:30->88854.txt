MUMBAI: In conflict with the complaints by parents and students and their medical report, an inquiry   submitted to the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights by the Thane   education department on Wednesday failed to mention that the students of   in Thane were reportedly beaten by their trustee in February.

 Angry over her sleep being disturbed, Shilpa Gautam, the school trustee, had allegedly locked up 50 students in a room and thrashed them with a fibre rod. Eighteen children landed in hospital, three of them with wrist fractures. 
 
  
 The report was submitted to the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which took suo motu cognizance of the issue.
 
 While the report by the deputy education officer at Thane Zilla Parishad said Gautam did not meet the investigators on three occasions citing health reasons, it includes a letter written by eight students. All the letters are identical and state that the trustee shouted at the students because of their mischief.
 
 The report said: “Students needed empty space to prepare for the school’s annual day celebration so the benches were moved and students were making noise. This is when the trustee came to check out the commotion... Shilpa Gautam shouted at the children in a loud voice and asked why they were making noise. The children got scared because she shouted loudly.” Activists called the report a “mischief”.
 
 “The children were taken to the hospital and there are medical reports proving that the children had injuries, some of which were severe,” said Ghanshyam Sonar, who is representing the parents.
