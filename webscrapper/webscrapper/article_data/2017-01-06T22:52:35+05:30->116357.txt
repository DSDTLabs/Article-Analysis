Ahmedabad: Wildlife enthusiasts have found evidence of tiger presence in the forests of Dang district bordering Maharashtra. Based on this information, Rajya Sabha MP Parimal Nathwani has urged the Gujarat government to conduct a scientific study or allow the central government’s investigation team to confirm the presence of tigers in the forests near Ahwa in Dang district.

 After the wildlife count of 2001, the Gujarat government had officially declared tigers to have become extinct in the state. But policemen and local people on Maharashtra-Gujarat border claim to have seen tigers in the forests there. Nathwani said in a statement that scats (faeces) of wild animals, collected on November 2, 2016 from the forest area in Maharashtra around 2-3 km from Gujarat, also indicated movement of tigers between two states. The scats show that at least a family of five tigers – one male, one female and three cubs – was present in the area, Nathwani stated. 
 
 Incidentally, two constables of Maharashtra police, posted on the check post on Gujarat-Maharashtra border, claimed to have spotted a tiger entering the Maharashtra forest area from Gujarat’s Ahwa forest in Dang. The big cat then went back to the forest in Gujarat, Nathwani said.
 
 “If the evidence is to be believed, we have tigers in Gujarat too. With the presence of both (lions and tigers) Gujarat will become a rare destination in the world where both the big cats are found,” said Nathwani.
