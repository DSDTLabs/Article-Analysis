PATIALA: Mohali-based special   court on Monday remanded chief of Khalistan Liberation Force ( ) Harminder Singh  , one of the escapees in the Nabha jailbreak of November 2016, to four-day custody of the National Investigating Agency.

 The NIA moved an application before the court that it needed to interrogate Mintoo in connection with the murder of RSS leader Ravinder  , who had been shot dead by two unidentified persons in October 2017, outside the main gate of his house in Gagandeep Colony in Jodhewal area of Ludhiana.
 
 Initially, the Punjab police had registered a case under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intent) of the IPC along with Section 25 of the Arms Act and Sections 10, 12 and 13 of the Prevention of Unlawful Activities Act at Jodhewal police station . They had also interrogation Ramandeep Singh and Hardeep Singh Shera, who are other prime accused in seven targeted killings of Punjab, and pieced together evidence that suggested that Mintoo was also involved in the case. Later, the investigations were handed over to the NIA which had registered a corresponding case on November 16, last year.
 
 According to defence counsel Jaspal Singh Manjhpur, Mintoo would now to be produced before the court on March 9, while the next date for hearing other cases of target killings had been fixed for April 3. He said the court has asked the prosecution to produce all accused through video conferencing during the next hearings till the NIA files its chargesheet against them.
 
 The NIA has got a 90-day extension for filing chargesheets after it moved applications before the court claiming that given the enormity of the investigations, the sleuths needed more time for filing chargesheets as the offences committed by the accused had inter-state and international ramifications.
 
 The NIA had claimed that the conspiracy had been hatched by persons living in Pakistan, United Kingdom and Italy and pieces of evidence were required to be collected from foreign countries by opening the diplomatic channels, for which more time was needed.
