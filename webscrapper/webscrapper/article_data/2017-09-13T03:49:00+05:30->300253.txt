Margao: President, state mahila Congress, Pratima Coutinho on Tuesday demanded that the police must step up vigilance around schools and educational institutes in view of the recent cases of crimes against children in several parts of India. “Police must verify persons employed in schools as bus drivers, conductors, peons, gardeners, etc to ensure that they do not have any criminal background. Schools should employ women as peons. Separate toilets could be provided for drivers, conductors and gardeners,” Coutinho said. tnn
