VADODARA: The   (VMC) will be beautifying entry points to the city from all directions with  .

 Some of these plants are exotic and have been procured by a private partner who has joined the VMC’s initiative.
 
 The VMC has been considering a plan to make entry points to the city visually appealing since quite some time. However, it did not want to do so merely by making gates or similar structures. It was decided to do so with greenery.
 
 The VMC in partnership with the   floated by a city-based outdoor advertising firm will plant exotic trees and plants at four entry points. The project has been taken up on a public-private partnership (PPP) mode. Advertising rights for earmarked space at these locations will be given to the firm.
 
 Sources said that after concerted efforts since over a month to identify exotic trees, members of the trust identified 12 varieties of trees and 27 varieties of shrubs that will be planted at city’s entry points. The functionaries of the trust travelled to places like Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, Kolkata and others to identify varieties of trees.
 
 A farm has now been converted into a nursery to nurture the plants. The exotic varieties of plants include Washingtonia, Ficus Panda, Phoenix Palm, Euphorbia and others that are not found locally. The plantations to the entries from each direction will have trees and plants that have the same colour or on which flowers of the same colour grow.
 
 The plants collected include over 6,000 trees that are already eight to 10 feet high and thousands of other plants. Around 12,000 more trees of different variety are expected to reach the city soon.
 
 “The initiative is a part of our Mission Million Trees. We will be planting trees not only in our spaces, but even across other institutions across the city,” said VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao.
