GAYA: Bodh   Temple Management Committee ( ), the body responsible for the management and conservation of world heritage site Mahabodhi Mahavihara, will set up a tent city on the western outskirts of the holy township for Buddha followers reaching here for the three-day-long   celebrations.

 Buddha Jayanti will be observed on April 30 this year to mark the holy coincidence of Buddha’s birth, enlightenment and salvation falling on the same summer full moon. The celebrations will begin on April 29 and conclude on May 1.
 
 Gaya DM Abhishek Singh, who is also the ex-officio chairman of BTMC, held a meeting on Monday to discuss preparations for the event. The meeting was attended by representatives of Bodh Gaya-based foreign monasteries as well.
 
 Sources said the ordinary Buddhist followers, known as laity, would be accommodated in the tent city to be established near the NH-83 intersection and separate arrangements will be made to accommodate 7,000 monks in the Kalchakra Maidan.
 
 Officials said Governor   would be the chief guest of the main event to be held near the shrine’s sanctum sanctorum on April 30.
 
 Gaya DM also directed the officials concerned to ensure uninterrupted water and power supply during the three-day event. BTMC will also arrange free e-rickshaws for old and differently-abled devotees. Altogether eight e-rickshaws will ferry the devotees in the restricted zone, where entry of motorized vehicles is banned. Two air-conditioned buses will also ply between Gaya railway station and Bodh Gaya.
 
 The district civil surgeon has been asked to hold special health camps for the visitors. Some officials attending Monday’s meeting raised the issue of beggars and stray dogs playing spoilsport during the all-important event. The DM asked the BTMC officials to address the issue.
