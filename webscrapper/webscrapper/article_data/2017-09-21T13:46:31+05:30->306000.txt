NAGPUR: Railway Protection Force ( ),  , nabbed 38-year-old Anil   while ferrying 36 kg low grade   in the general coach of Lucknow-Chennai Express on Tuesday. Nigam was remanded to custody on Wednesday by the local court.

 Senior PI Abhay Panhekar of GRP said Nigam’s call details shall be obtained. “We will probe all angles. It seems the low grade explosives were to be used in crackers,” he said.
 
 Joint senior PI WN Dabre said the packets have been sent to Forensic Science Laboratory for chemical analysis. “The explosives filled in two-inch plastic pipes were supposed to make small blasts to stop monkeys from entering farms, as they destroy crops,” he said.
