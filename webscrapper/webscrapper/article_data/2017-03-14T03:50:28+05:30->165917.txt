MUMBAI: When renowned architect F W Stevens designed the   headquarters back in the nineteenth century, little did he imagine that one day the Gothic structure would be adorned with decorative multi-coloured lights.

 Work on illuminating the BMC headquarters on the lines of   ( ) began last month. 
 
 Metal poles for scaffolding have already been put up all over the historic   for the purpose (see pic).
 
 One of the engineers who is involved with the project said the work will span a few months and is expected to be tied up before monsoon. “The building currently has warm lights which are switched on in the evenings to enhance its beauty. However, now the plan is to use a colour scheme of red, green and blue as well as the warm light with advanced technology. We will make use of these lights for over two dozen themes,” he said. 
 
 The   would be adjusted by two software programming control rooms. There is a plan to use a projector too, to beam different themes such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan or colours of the Indian flag on Republic Day and Independence Day. 
 
 “We are waiting for the lights to arrive. The lighting fixtures are being imported from China,” said a civic official. 
 
 Currently, a large number of Mumbaikars and tourists flock to CST to click pictures when the structure is lit on special occasions. 
 
 It may be recollected that the BMC, in its 2016-17 budget, had allocated Rs 10 crore to illuminate the municipal headquarters on the lines of CST. 
 
 Meanwhile, right outside the civic headquarters, the BMC has also begun work on constructing a viewing gallery from where photography enthusiasts would be able to click pictures of all the heritage structures around—BMC headquarters, CST and Capitol Cinema, one of the city’s oldest theatres.
