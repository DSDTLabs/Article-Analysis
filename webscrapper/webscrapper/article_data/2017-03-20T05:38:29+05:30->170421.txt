DEHRADUN: Pauri Garhwal has emerged as the most highprofile district in Uttarakhand with both the newly-inducted CMs of Uttarakhand and UP,   and Yogi   respectively, hailing from here.

 While Rawat is from   village, Adityanath hails from   village of Pauri. In addition, four former CMs and a host of prominent officials involved in the country's security hail from the hill district which lies in the western part of the state.
 
 National security advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval who is from Banelsyun village, RAW chief Anil Dhasmana who hails from Toli village, and Army chief   -belonging to Saina village -are the other success stories of the district.
 
 What is it about the place that makes it the breeding ground of success stories? Kotdwar resident Anil Maindola says that the region can easily be termed “the intellectual capital of the state.“ “However, despite there being so many CMs, cabinet ministers and bureaucrats from the area, the district continues to grapple with   problems and other issues,“ he said.
