  Surya is an Indian Army officer who has serious anger management issues. Although he is a brilliant officer, when anger takes control of him he is impossible to subdue. So, what happens to Surya? Does he get the better of his anger?
 
 
 The first half of the film, which is engaging in parts, is eerily reminiscent of Mani Ratnam's 'Kaatru Velidiyai'('Cheliyaa' in Telugu) in parts, without any of the subtlety of the Karthi-starrer. Surya is in-your-face, rude and has no qualms about being the way he is, even when it costs him his love, friends and even his career.

 ‚ÄòNaa Peru Surya, Naa Illu India‚Äô is a hard film to describe, what with so much happening in a span of less than 3 hours. The film has all the requirements of a commercial potboiler ‚Äì there‚Äôs a love track, a family drama, an ambitious man striving to make it big in his career, several points of conflict complete with goondas and other moral dilemmas that all play out while interspersed at regular intervals with colourful and highly choreographed songs.
