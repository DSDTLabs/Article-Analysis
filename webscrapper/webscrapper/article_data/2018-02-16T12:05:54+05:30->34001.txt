RAJKOT: A major fire broke out at a commercial complex near Khambhalia Gate in   on Thursday evening. 

 The fire started from the third floor of Chaitanya Complex. The blaze was triggered by a massive blast in the office of advocate Ramesh Shrimali in which three persons were badly burned. 
 
 “Those burned in the accident include Shrimali (39), Divya Bhadrecha (35) and an unidentified person. They have been shifted to GG Hospital,” said an official from Jamnagar fire brigade. 
 
 “Though initially it was suspected that the blast from a gas cylinder had caused the fire, the real reason of the accident is yet to be investigated, as there was no cylinder found on the spot,” added the official.
