GUWAHATI: A committee comprising senior health department officials and ophthalmologists will hold a meeting on Tuesday to recommend some changes for the civil   in   district where a 'botched' cataract operation was carried out almost a fortnight ago. 

 A senior official at the   ( ) told TOI on Monday that the sterilization system at the  , where elderly patients had reported loss of vision and severe infection after a routine cataract surgery, needs to be strengthened. Besides, there are other aspects, too, which need to be improved, he added. 
 
 Altogether, 13 elderly patients out of 41 had undergone a free cataract surgical procedure under the NPCB at the civil hospital on March 7 and 11.
 
 A state level investigation is still on to find out to what exactly went wrong. A report is expected next week. 
 
 "The officials and experts of the committee will sign and suggest recommendations for the civil hospital so that such incidents are not repeated again. The committee will ensure that no stone is left unturned to bring about the changes," said the NPCB official.
 
 The next course of action will be decided once the state-level inquiry report is out. Stringent action could be taken if it is proved that the surgical procedure was indeed a botched one.
 
 "Compensation for the victims will be decided after we get the report and if only it suggests that there were some errors during the surgical procedure. We are still looking into the matter," said a senior health department official. 
 
 Another confusion that still prevails is the total number of people who have reported loss of vision. The official from the NPCB told TOI that two to four patients have lost their vision in the eye on which they were operated on. 
 
 But the senior official from the department of health said it is not yet exactly loss of vision. "It is not yet confirmed. Vision could be reduced but there is no final word on it yet," added the official.
