NAGPUR: ‘Shatkon’, a 90-minute feature film on mystery adventures of six kids, shot mostly in the city, will hit the screens across   soon, said director Aditya Buty on Friday.

 Addressing a press conference, Buty said six kids from Nagpur have acted in the film which has stars like   and Prarthana Behere. Nagpur has wonderful characters who are given a platform to showcase their talent as actors in ‘Shatkon’. Love for kids made me direct the film, he added.
 
 Auditions were held to select the kids following which they were trained for about three weeks before the shooting began. The film focuses on curious nature of children and the benefits that come with it for a better society, Buty said.
 
 Buty said that he felt honoured that   readily agreed to act in his first Marathi film that was shot at Deekshabhoomi, Ramdaspeth, Ambazari and Bajaj Nagar, besides other locations. 
 
 Gokhale, who is in the role of a divisional commissioner, said, “I feel happy to have been invited to Nagpur for a film from where I started my career from the erstwhile   in 1968. The film tries to show how intelligent today’s kids are to make maximum use of digital technology.”
 
 Commenting on the controversy surrounding Madhur Bhandarkar’s movie ‘Indu Sarkar’, supposedly based in the backdrop of Emergency that was clamped in 1975, Gokhale said that in a democratic nation, every individual has the right to make a film on any theme which he feels is right and there should be no ‘private’ censorship.
 
 The children who acted in the movie were present along with their parents and shared their experiences.
