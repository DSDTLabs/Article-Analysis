RANCHI:   on Wednesday acquitted   charged for the murder of Gossner Evangelical Church   Martin Tete for the lack of evidence. 

 Roshan Lal Bhatia, Anil Kapoor and Tapas Mukherjee were acquitted by Justice Pradeep Kumar. 
 
 Speaking to mediapersons after the hearing, Bishwajit Mukherjee, the lawyer for the accused, said the court dismissed the case for 'lack of merit'.
 
 Bhatia, Kapoor and Mukherjee were three of the five accused in the Tete's death. Two other accused, CSR Topno and MG Mohan have died during trials. 
 
 Tete had gone to Kolkata in June 1990 and was going to return to Ranchi the next day. However, Tete's body arrived in Ranchi three days later. Tete's wife Herelin Tete lodged FIR at the Lower Bazar police station, alleging that Tete was murdered. The priest's body was later exhumed for medical examination.
 
 A medical board ruled that Tete did not die of heart attack following which the case was reopened. Bhatia was sent to jail by the chief judicial magistrate in 1993 but he came out on bail. All the five were acquitted for lack of evidence in 2002. Tete's widow moved the Supreme Court which later ordered the case to be reopened.
