NEW DELHI:   failed to transact business on Tuesday after   and the opposition repeatedly raised the issue of mob lynching in the name of cow protection, forcing the Speaker to adjourn the House. Besides seeking a debate on lynchings, opposition members also asked the Chair to revoke the five-day suspension of six Congress MPs.

 Appealing to “kind hearted” Speaker  , Congress leader in the House Mallikarjuna Kharge sought a lenient treatment to be shown to Gaurav Gogoi, K Suresh, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Ranjeet Ranjan, Sushmita Dev and MK Raghavan, who were suspended for causing “grave disorder” in the House on Monday. Supporting Congress, Trinamool Congress’ Saugata Roy said some MPs may have got carried away “in the fit of emotion”. He said the inauguration of the new President made it an auspicious day and the suspension should be revoked. 
 
 However, the government took a tough stand on the issue with parliamentary affairs minister   asking if the leaders were simultaneously supporting the actions of the suspended members and seeking revocation of their punishment. The Speaker did not take any decision.
