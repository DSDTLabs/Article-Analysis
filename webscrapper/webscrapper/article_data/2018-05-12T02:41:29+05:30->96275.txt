LUCKNOW/AYODHYA: From Sita's 'maika' (maternal home) in   - now in Nepal - to her 'sasural' (in-laws' home) in Ayodhya, the route for the bus flagged off by Prime Minister   in Nepal on Friday is repl ete with mythological significance.

 
 The bus will reach Ayodhya on Saturday morning, tracing the 450km 'Ram-Janaki Marg', the route taken by Lord Ram's wedding procession.
 
 While the 'Ram-Janaki Marg' is said to have passed through several districts - including Ayodhya, Basti, Azamgarh, Mau, Ghazipur, Balia, parts of Gorakhpur, Bastar, Patna, Vaishali, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Sitamarhi and Janankpur - the bus route has some minor variations. The bus will navigate through Janakpur, Sitamarhi, Motihari, Gorakhpur, Basti and then reach Ayodhya.
 
 "Sitaji was found in an earthen pot in the Mithila region of Bihar, now Sitamarhi. King Janak took her to Janakpur, where she grew up. Both these places bear mythological significance," said vice-chancellor of Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University, Faizabad, professor Manoj Dixit. "So the route is between the 'maika' and 'sasural' of Sitaji," he added.
 
 Meanwhile, the direct bus service evoked much interest among locals, seers and pilgrims in Ayodhya. Residents hailed the service saying it would further promote religious tourism and create jobs.
 
 The chief mahant of Gopal Mandir, Jagatguru Ram Dineshacharya, said the bus service was perhaps one of the best decisions by the government.
 
 Local tour operators hoped the bus service would boost their business. One of them said he now expected more offers of special packages for NRIs.
