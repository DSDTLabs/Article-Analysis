MUMBAI: Three months after a group of youngsters stole cash from donation boxes of two temples in   (east), and continue to evade arrest, a trustee of one of those temples has taken to social media for help.   footage from the temples captured the youths who masqueraded as devotees and carried a backpack along to hide the loot. 

 On February 27, two youngsters arrived on a two-wheeler at Vitthal Rakhumai temple at   road. "It was 3.30 pm and the temple was shut for visitors. Caretakers are usually present indoors, but had stepped out for a bit. The boys may have kept a watch and known that the temple opens for visitors at 4 pm, choosing a time when they could commit the crime undetected," said the temple's trustee  . "They kept the main door open and entered the inner sanctum," he said. Cameras captured them after they shut the door of the inner sanctum and started to work on the donation box. They had got tools and took a little over five minutes to break the lock. One of the boys kept watch. They stuffed the cash, estimated to be around Rs 30,000, in their backpack and left the inner sanctum. "The boys touched the floor with their fingertips before pretending to prostrate," said Kadam.
 
 On February 18, three youngsters had entered the nearby Hanuman temple. This time, they scooted with the donation box. Cameras outside the temple showed one of them seated outside while his two aides went in at 3.10 pm. One aide brought out the donation box discreetly and stuffed it in the backpack. The trio then fled. 
 
 "Footage from both temples was given to   police station and an FIR lodged, but cops claim their faces are not clear. ... Recently, I uploaded details of the theft on social media," said Kadam.
