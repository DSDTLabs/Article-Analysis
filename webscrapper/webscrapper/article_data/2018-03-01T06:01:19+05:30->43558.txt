AHMEDABAD: Soon after   (AMC)'s appeal to the citizens to promote 'tilak' holi and save water number of residential societies in different parts of the city have taken initiative to conserve water by celebrating dry Holi. While some have shun celebrations altogether, others are moving around to propagate celebration of dry Holi. 

  organized a community gathering on Tuesday, appealing community members to go celebrate dry Holi. "A few of us gathered and put tilak on each other's foreheads and later played Holi with gulaal and dry colours. The initiative has been taken to spread the message of tilak Holi and not waste water," said one of the members.
 
 Hitesh Thakkar, volunteer leader,  , said, "Year after year on Holi, there is wastage of water in residential societies. We have therefore decided to play dry Holi with gulaal and dry colours and not waste water. To create awareness about this,   of our association will be organizing a get together in different societies on Wednesday on SG Road and promote tilak Holi."
 
 Some residential societies have already issued directives to the residents and urging them not to waste water. "It's been a practice to discourage water wastage during the festival. We have warned the residents that no extra water will be supplied for Holi other than the twice-a-day supply and therefore, denizens must use water judiciously," said a member of Bopal-based housing society.
