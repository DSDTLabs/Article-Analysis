MANGALURU: With stringent rules of CBSE for NEET in place, it was a test not only for students but also for their parents as well. Scores of parents who accompanied their wards were seen busy in the early summer morning, making sure that they adhered to the norms.

 When this reporter visited some of the examination centres in the city, he found that parents and relatives were removing jewellery and exchanging footwear which they were wearing. People could also be seen removing sacred thread, head scarf, handkerchiefs, hair bands, wallets, hair clips, belts, watches and cellphones.
 
 Furthermore, some people could be seen running in anxiety and a confused state, as they did not sign their hall ticket, and some forgot to attach their photos. However, most of the candidates made sure that they reached the exam centre on time, while their guardians waited in the campus till the exams got over.
 
 Those who checked the students before entering the exam hall made sure that they had everything in place. Scissors and torch lights were in place to check students. Scissors are meant to be used in case someone wears long sleeves, which is not allowed as per rules. Torch light was used to see if anything is hidden inside the ears or mouth. NEET guidelines say that candidates are allowed to wear only light clothes with half sleeves. There should be no big buttons, brooch or badge. Candidates are allowed to wear slippers and sandals with low heels. “Compared to previous years, this time there was not much confusion, as candidates were well informed about the rules and process,” expressed an exam centre in-charge, speaking to TOI.
 
 Exams were held in nearly one-and-a-half dozen centres in undivided Dakshina Kannada. More than 10,000 plus students appeared for it. “Each centre had students from Kasaragod in Kerala, Goa and neighbouring districts,” said an in-charge of another exam centre.
 
 The NEET results are expected to be announced on June 5.
