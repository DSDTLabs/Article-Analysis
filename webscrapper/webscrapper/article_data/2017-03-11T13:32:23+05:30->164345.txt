PANAJI: The Congress has begun to increase its tally in the 2017 state assembly elections to put up a strong fight against the Bharatiya Janta Party in Goa. Congress has won eight seats while the BJP has won seven constituencies even as counting continues to decide the composition of the 40-member state assembly.

 Goa Forward has already won two constituencies and is leading in another constituency out of the four seats that it contested in Goa assembly polls. The MGP and the NCP have also opened their account with one constituency each.
 
 Congress had shown good momentum in the early half of counting day to lead in various seats before BJP began to trim Congress’ lead. 
 
 BJP’s vote share in the state assembly elections stands at 33.7% while the Congress continues to trail the BJP with 29.4% vote share. 
 
 The BJP suffered a major setback with current chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar losing to Congress candidate Dayanand Sopte in Mandrem.
