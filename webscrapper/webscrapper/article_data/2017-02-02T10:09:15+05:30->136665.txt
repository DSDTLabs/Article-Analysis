HYDERABAD: Telangana received a raw deal in the general budget presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday, government officials said. Hopes of getting an   (AIIMS) for the state were dashed when the minister granted the institutes only to Jharkhand and Gujarat. Incidentally, the Union health minister during his visit to the state had promised an AIIMS for the state.

 “It is disappointing not to get an AIIMS as promised. We will take up this matter with the NDA government. However, reduction of tax for small industries and relief on personal income tax are encouraging moves,” said  .
 
 Several other promises made to the state also failed to see the light of the day. During the budget speech, the finance minister did not mention grants for educational institutions promised in the AP Reorganisation Act. The Act had promised institutions of excellence for Telangana on par with Andhra Pradesh. AP was granted IIM, NIT, central university, Indian Institute of Scientific Research, Tribal and Petro universities by the Centre and some of them have already started functioning.
 
 “The Union budget has deprived Telangana its rightful institutions and funds. Despite our chief minister being the first one to support demonetisation, the Centre has failed to reciprocate it by fulfilling the promises,” S Venugopalachary, special representative of Telangana in New Delhi, told TOI.
 
 What shocked the state government was that there was no mention of financial assistance for Mission Bhagiratha. The project was lauded by the Centre and Niti Aayog had recommended funding of about Rs 26,000 crore for Mission Bhagiratha. Except giving funds under the head of arsenic and fluoride eradication program, no special funding was given to Mission Bhagiratha.
