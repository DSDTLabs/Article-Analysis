PUNE: Making the mandatory ‘video resume’ and promotional footage for the civic election is proving to be a tough task for candidates. The election commission has rejected 25% videos citing reasons pertaining to code of conduct violations.

 The condition, to make the   résumé, has been introduced for the first time. The résumé was seen as visual evidence of promises made by aspirants. While the election commission had made the video mandatory initially, it was later made optional considering the expenses involved in the entire process.
 
 As per civic officials, the video profiles are to be submitted to the election department and should be shown at polling booths so voters get a fair idea about the candidates.
 
 “Although the videos have been made optional, many candidates are working on them since some non-governmental organizations made such a demand,” a civic official said. 
 
 He added that this is increasing the pressure on the administration which has to check the clips. As per the official, as many as 1,090 candidates are contesting the elections. Separate videos for the biodata and promotional purposes would take the number to over 1,300.
 
 A special scrutiny committee has been formed to keep a watch on the videos. Those who wish to use the CD require an approval of this committee.
 
  “The committee includes broadcasting experts who provide technical support. It also has election officials who have knowledge about the code of conduct,” said Vilas Kanade, coordinator of PMC’s code of conduct cell.
 
 “We have asked candidates to provide scripts as well as video clips, both of which should pass the fixed parameters. We have rejected clips that did not abide by the norms. Nearly 200 videos have been approved,” said Sanjay More, a member of the screening committee.
