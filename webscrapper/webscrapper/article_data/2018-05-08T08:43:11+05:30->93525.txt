 After survey, data from 33 countries will be sent to Canada’s   by next month for further analysis. The study will then focus on formulating health policies with concerned governments and issuing preventive steps and treatment protocols.

 Prof Ghoshal, who is also the chair of international liaison committee of Rome Foundation, said that the survey is being done via internet and household method. “The internet mode is being undertaken in developed countries with high internet reach, but since internet penetration in India is around 40% only, so the household method of physical survey has been adopted here,” he said.
