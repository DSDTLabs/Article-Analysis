AHMEDABAD: Exports of ceramic products from Morbi are expected to almost double in 2017-18 reaching Rs 11,000-12,000 crore, compared to Rs 6,200 crore worth exports in the previous year say industry players. Competitive prices coupled with technological upgradation and higher production has revived Morbi, the largest cluster of ceramic tile makers in India.

 “Till December 2017, our export had already crossed Rs 8,500 crore. Although final figures are yet to be collated, exports are likely to further surge to Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 12,000 crore in financial year 2017-18,” said  , president,  .
 
 According to ceramic tile makers, exports from the region, which houses over 700 manufacturing units, are estimated to grow at 30% to 40% in fiscal 2017-18. “The Vibrant Ceramic Expo held in Gandhinagar in November last year played a key role in pushing up exports this year. The exhibition not only brought in large export orders, but also helped spread awareness among importers from various countries about the quality products being manufactured in Morbi,” added Kundariya.
 
 Tile makers in Morbi have heavily invested in technology upgradation as well as in-house research and development enabling them produce quality products in all sizes and designs.
 
 “As a result, production increased and its cost came down making prices of Morbi-made ceramic tiles competitive in the international market. Morbi, which was facing stiff competition from China, has managed to regain its share lost to the neighbouring country in the global market. All these contributed to the higher exports in FY18,” said industry players.
 
 Morbi ceramic industry exports its products to 150 countries, including US, Canada, Middle East and Far East and Latin American countries. Morbi-based ceramic tile makers have also made inroads into ceramics producing countries such as Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and  .
 
 Overall, ceramic tile production in Morbi is estimated to be around Rs 32,000 crore in recently concluded financial year as compared to Rs 28,500 crore in previous fiscal. “Exports now account for 35% of our total turnover,” Kundariya added.
