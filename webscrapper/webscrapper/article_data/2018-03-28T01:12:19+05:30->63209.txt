Trichy: Weeks after the common public and state highways department took up a cleaning drive along the Chettipaalam bridge near MGR roundabout and the parapet walls of Cauvery bridge distracting the attention of commuters, the political   is back at the same spots.

 The return of wall paintings in public properties particularly close to the right of way (RoW) only signifies the collective failure of respective stakeholders to punish and penalise the offenders who exploit the public properties for personal gains, rued the public.
 
 D Manoj, one of the organisers involved in the cleaning drive at Chettipaalam bridge said, “We have been persistently insisting the city corporation and other stakeholders concerned about the nuisance caused by political parties using public places for advertisements. But there comes no concrete response to keep such defacement on public properties at bay.” Recently, the political party Puthiya Thamilagam was accused by the youths involved in cleaning drive for defacing the public properties including flyovers and parapet walls of bridges by advertising their party’s upcoming public meeting.
 
 A couple of weeks back, city police based on a TOI report lodged a case against local unit attached with CITU for a similar violation under the provisions of Tamil Nadu Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act, 1959. However, suo motu crackdown from city police is farce against the offenders without any complaints, lamented the organisers involved in cleaning drives during weekends. 
 
 When contacted, an official with state highways department said that measures would be taken for removing the graffiti on Cauvery bridge, while a senior official city police assured that actions against the persons defacing the public properties would be taken under Tamil Nadu Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act.
