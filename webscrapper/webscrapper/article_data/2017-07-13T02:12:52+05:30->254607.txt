PATNA: A defiant   ruled out resigning from the Bihar cabinet on Wednesday and asked how he could be a scamster when he was all of 14 years and hadn’t even started sprouting facial hair at the time of the alleged land deal. 

 “It’s because of (PM Narendra) Modi and (BJP chief Amit) Shah that CBI has implicated me in the case of 2004. I was 14 or 15 then... moochh bhi nahi aayee thi,” RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s younger son and Bihar deputy CM said, after coming out of a cabinet meeting chaired by CM Nitish Kumar. While Tejashwi spoke, Nitish avoided the media.
 
 Unfazed by reports of Nitish-led JD(U)’s discomfiture over his continuance in the cabinet as he is an accused in the CBI’s FIR pertaining to an alleged illegal land deal, the 1989-born first-time MLA said he did not have any post at the time of the alleged land deal. 
 
 “I haven’t done anything wrong and have worked transparently ever since I joined the government,” Tejashwi said and reiterated that he would not resign and instead go to the people’s court against the conspiracy to frame him, as he had been mandated by the people to be in the government. Tejashwi said BJP leaders were earlier scared of his father. “Now, they are afraid of a rookie politician belonging to the backward caste because I expose their false promises made to people,” he said and added, “Hum munhtod jawaab denge (we will give a befitting reply).” 
 
 Meanwhile, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi called chief minister Nitish Kumar and thanked him for supporting Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the Opposition’s candidate for vice-president.
