HYDERABAD: The   and   (HMWS&SB) has decided to install ‘automated water meters’ on a pilot basis in three areas in the city. These meters, which work with radio frequency technology, will help the board collect meter readings online. Currently, the meters are operated manually, with an official visiting the households and issuing bills based on the noted readings.

 The   has selected three areas in three Operation and Maintenance (O&M) divisions — Chintal Basthi in Red Hills (O&M IV), SR Nagar in Banjara Hills (O&M VI) and Gachibowli division in O&M XV. The cost of installing the   in Chintal Basthi has been assessed at Rs 1.10 lakh while in Banjara Hills and Gachibowli it would be Rs 76.56 lakh and Rs 86 lakh respectively. The board will fix the meters in these areas on their own and no fee will be collected from the consumers, a senior Water Board official told TOI.
 
 The Water Board has prepared the proposal, along with the cost estimates, and will submit it to the municipal administration and urban development department in a week. Following that, tenders will be invited for the project. 
 
 The process of installing the meters is likely to start in July. Based on the success of the RFID meters, the officials will install it for all consumers, including those who currently do not have meters. According to the Water Board records, nearly 4.50 lakh consumers do not have meters and are being charged only nominal rates. The RFID technology will also help the board save losses due to fraudulent consumers. The   is already implementing the technology for the past couple of years.
