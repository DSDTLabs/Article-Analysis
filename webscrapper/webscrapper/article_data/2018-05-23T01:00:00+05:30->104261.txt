 traffic police has roped in city-based   Alisha Abdullah to do a public service announcement — on digital payment of fines and also spread awareness on safe driving. Alisha says, “I was called by AK Viswanathan (Commissioner, Greater Chennai) and R Sudhakar (Joint Commissioner, Traffic) a few days ago for a meeting and that’s when it got finalised. We did the shoot yesterday at Irungattukottai racing track. Instead of paying fines directly to the cops, traffic violators can pay it via net banking, digital wallets, etc. Cops will also give out e-challans to traffic violators. This commercial will be aired on television and also screened in theatres.” She adds, “Last night, I also did another shoot at Marina beach road to create awareness on safe riding, especially on the importance of wearing helmets.” Alisha had earlier acted in the Atharvaa-starrer Irumbu Kuthirai. Ask her how it feels to be in front of the camera again, and she quips, “It’s not that easy. Each shot had to be taken multiple times. Driving comes quite naturally to me, but what I had to say in front of the camera after coming out of the car was challenging. Over the weekend, I also did another shoot with budding Bollywood actor, Ahaan Panday, to promote electric cars in India. Also, I am in talks for doing a film on racing.”
