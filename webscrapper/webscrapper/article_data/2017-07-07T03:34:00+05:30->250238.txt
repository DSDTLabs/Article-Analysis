Panaji: The commission for persons with disabilities has directed the directorate of health services (DHS) to give an appointment letter immediately and with retrospective effect to a candidate with loco-motor disability who applied for the post of an attendant in 2015. The commission has also directed that T Gaude, who applied in the reserved category, be absorbed in the general category until they create a supernumerary post for him. The DHS received NOCs from the personnel department to fill up two posts reserved for the hearing impaired, one post for visually-impaired and one in the loco-motor disability category, but advertised double the number of vacancies in each of these reserved categories in 2015. The minutes of the district selection committee meeting held late 2015 and early 2016 for selection of candidates recommended Gaude’s selection under the reserved category for loco-motor disability. An offer of temporary appointment and an offer of appointment in September 2016 were also sent to him with a request to complete the medical examination and other formalities to join the post. Despite numerous visits to the DHS, he wasn’t given forms for medical examination and police verification like the others who received offer of appointment letters along with him.  The order passed by the state commissioner for persons with disabilities Anuradha Joshi states that the directorate of health services added salt to injury when it cancelled/withdrew his offer of appointment without citing any reason for such an act. The commission directed DHS to give Gaude an appointment letter immediately with retrospective effect, bringing him at par with the other three people who were given offers of appointments followed by appointment orders, and absorb him in the general category until it creates a supernumerary post. DHS has sought an additional 30 days’ time to implement the order and has moved the proposal to seek permission for his appointment, citing a ban on recruitment.
