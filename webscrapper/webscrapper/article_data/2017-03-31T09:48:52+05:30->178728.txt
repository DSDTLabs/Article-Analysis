 A woman tweeted the external affairs minister saying she needs help with her visa. 
 
 "Please help me for my visa," the woman said, adding in Hindi "Do I have to kill myself to get my message for help to you"? 
 
  
  
 
 The external affairs minister told the distraught woman to not kill herself, of course. She urged her to tell her what she was having a problem with.
 
  
  
 
 Turns out, the Indian woman is married to citizen of   – as per her earlier tweets – and she’s been denied a visa there three times.
