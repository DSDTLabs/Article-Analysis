The makers of ‘Baywatch’ dropped the second trailer online recently and if this new clip is anything to go by, we’re in for a fun ride when the film finally hits theatres in May this year. But looks like   fans will have to wait a tad longer because much like the first trailer, the second one too has the actress in a blink-and-miss appearance. 

 The trailer opens with Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson playing Mitch Buchannon, the head life guard, who takes his job and team seriously. His partner in crime is Zac Efron who plays the character of Matt Brody, a new recruit. The trailer gives us a peek into the laugh riot that it’s going to be – case in point being when Zac is seen disguised as a girl for their undercover operation. The other highlights of the trailer include Zac Efron and Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson showing off their super ripped bodies and some stylish action-packed sequences! 
  
 Priyanka looks totally in character as the baddie,  , but guess we’ll have to wait longer to see more of her. The actress took to Instagram to share the trailer and captioned it, “Drugs. Murder. A dead body on our beach. And it all started once she took over.” #BeBaywatch#VictoriaLeeds @baywatchmovie#May26
