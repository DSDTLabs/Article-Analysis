KOLKATA: Dinesh Karthik has made numerous comebacks to the Indian team since playing his first international match way back in September 2004. Leading   for the first time, he seems to have inculcated that never-say-die spirit in his new franchise.

 
 
 
 The ‘purple brigade’ has had its ups and downs in  , but what has stood the team in good stead is the ability to lift themselves when the chips have been down. They showed great character in winning four matches on the trot after suffering their heaviest-ever defeat in the competition - a 102-run drubbing at the hands of nemesis Mumbai Indians at Eden Gardens.
 
 
 
 The Knight Riders are now two wins away from lifting the coveted trophy for the third time. They face   in Qualifier 2 at the Eden on Friday, with the winners travelling to Mumbai to face Chennai Super Kings. Hardly an impossible task for a team which had won eight consecutive matches to be crowned champions in 2014.
 
  
  
 
 In a long tournament like the IPL, it’s important to peak at the right time. If KKR have timed their upswing well, the form of Sunrisers Hyderabad has taken a dramatic nosedive.
 
 Having ensured a top-two finish by winning nine of their first 11 games in the league stage, SRH have suffered defeats in their last four games — including Qualifier 1, against CSK. It’s been pretty even between the two teams this season so far, with Hyderabad winning in Kolkata and KKR triumphing in Hyderabad. Last year, KKR had got the better of SRH in the Eliminator.
 
 SRH will bank on their bowlers, who have time and again defended low totals this season. Even in Qualifier 1, they came close to restricting Chennai Super Kings after putting a meagre 139/7 on the board.
 
 But SRH will be aware that like CSK, KKR also bat deep and hence the job will be challenging. Afghanistan spinner Rashid Khan, who has 18 wickets in his kitty, will be raring to go after watching KKR’s batsmen struggle against the Rajasthan spin trio on Wednesday.
