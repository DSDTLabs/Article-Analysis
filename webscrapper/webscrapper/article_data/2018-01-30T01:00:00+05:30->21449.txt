'Life is uncertain and so are the tracks of some television shows!   and  , the lead couple of ' ', realised this when the makers of the show made an overnight decision to wrap up their tracks by early February, which will be followed by a two-year time leap.   tells us, “Neither did they give us a reason, nor did we ask them. In fact, our show is doing well in the early evening slot. I guess it’s a creative experiment and the producers want to turn it into a kids’ show.”

If you are the protagonist, you will not be able to do more than one show at a time. So, once the project ends, you have to start hunting for work again. Such a scenario causes insecurity among actors. I am fortunate that I am an RJ and I am quite satisfied with my acting career. I go with the flow and have even done cameos after playing lead characters. I believe that as an artiste, my job is to perform, irrespective of the length of the character. I am still positive and there is no bad blood between the producers of 'Bhootu' and me. We worked hard for seven months and now, it feels like our exams are finally over. I just want to clarify that contrary to the reports that we have been asked to leave or we are exiting the show, the truth is that our tracks are ending.”

I would advise them to save the money they make in the first two years; that will help them sail through the difficult times,” she sums up.
