COIMBATORE: DMK working president M K   accused chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami of pushing Tamil Nadu’s growth behind by about 20 years.

 In a statement on Sunday, he also vowed that DMK would not hesitate to end the “corrupt, undemocratic and illegal” government run by Palaniswami. “I warn Palaniswami not to day dream of cowing down DMK which has launched a democratic fight to end the   rule,’’ he said.
 
 Flaying Palaniswami for his attempts to politicize DMK’s efforts to revive waterbodies, Stalin dared the chief minister to order a probe into AIADMK’s claim of spending Rs 100 crore for reviving waterbodies in the state. “The CM says silt from waterbodies was given to farmers. Who were the real beneficiaries and how many of them were AIADMK men?’’ he questioned. Insinuating that the desilting works worth Rs 100 crore were given to AIADMK men, Stalin dared Palaniswami to order a probe if he denied involvement of AIADMK men in the projects.
 
 “Palaniswami is threatening government officials not to permit DMK to desilt waterbodies,’’ he alleged. He further charged that the chief minister was behind AIADMK and officials preventing his visit to supervise desilting of   lake in   resulting in a law and order situation.
 
 Recalling Palaniswami’s comments that DMK was attempting to fish in troubled waters, Stalin said that it was Palaniswami who was fishing in the troubled waters of AIADMK. “DMK is all set to achieve a huge victory in democratic way. So there is no need for us to fish in troubled waters,’’ he said.
