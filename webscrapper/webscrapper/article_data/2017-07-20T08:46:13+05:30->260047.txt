NAGPUR: The investigation into the   of Bhavesh Gautam has not met with much success. The inconsolable father of the 22-year-old, whose dead body found inside a 9ft deep empty water tank at   ( ) on Tuesday, claimed his son was murdered. He said the body was dumped at the desolate place to destroy evidence.

 The   was conducted in the presence of   police at GMCH on Wednesday, but did not hint at any suspicious or fatal injuries.
 
 Bhavesh, student of BE final year, was a native of Gondia. He stayed with four other roommates at a rented place in Vaibhav Nagar, Wanadongri, since last three years. His kin said they have been informed that Bhavesh had gone to Andhra Dhaba, located in front of his college, with an unknown man on a red Pulsar bike for lunch on Monday at 4pm.
 
 “My son could not commit suicide. He was enthusiastic about his forthcoming campus interviews. On July 14, he celebrated his birthday with his college group at a dhaba. I spoke to him on Saturday, since then we were not in contact,” Bhavesh’s father, Ramesh, a high schoolteacher, told TOI.
 
 College staffers said Bhavesh was very particular about his attendance and quite good in studies too.
 
 API Pradeep Lande, who is trying to unravel the mystery, said, “The medical report claimed ‘no suspicious’ reason for demise. The deep injury found on his back probably occurred after falling inside the tank. Still, we have some doubts, which could take the probe towards a different direction.”
