AHMEDABAD: While the state government has been beating its chest with claims that the   (MMR) has fallen, the CAG report proved these false for the last three years.

 The CAG report revealed that 15,817 newborns died within the first week of birth, due to lapses on the part of the   in providing the prescribed care and treatment.
 
  Though the neonatal morality rate (NMR) and infant mortality rate (IMR) reduced since 2011 through the Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK), a scheme to assure free care to all pregnant women and sick neonates, in the last three years, the MMR situation has worsened.
 
 MMR rose from 72 in 2013-14 to 80 in 2014-15. It climbed further to 85 in 2015-16, the report said with the comment, “Considering the pace and direction of achievement of the goals, it would be difficult for the state to achieve the target of 67 by March 2017. It was apparent that implementation of JSSK did not help in achieving the MMR goals. The implementation of the scheme was fraught with many deficiencies and gaps.”
 
  The CAG report holds low operationalization of   (PHCs) – just 323 out of the 1,334 PHCs were operational 24x7 by August last year. Despite implementation of Janani Suraksha Yojna and JSSK, the percentage of institutional deliveries at primary health facilities did not improve. In the majority of cases – 53% to 60% —   could not be provided to mothers and neonates. 
 
 This was because they were discharged in less than 48 hours of delivery.
 
 Even enough food was not provided to mothers and kids. Instead of thrice a day, diet was provided only twice a day. Diagnostic facilities were not available at some PHCs and community health centres (CHC), the report said.
