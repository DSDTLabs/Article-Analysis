Several people were injured and vehicles were set ablaze in clashes between   and BJP workers during the byelection in Ater assembly constituency in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday.

 Violence marred the Ater bypoll in   region of Madhya Pradesh, with Congress candidate   alleging a murder attempt and BJP calling him “mentally derailed”. In contrast,   voted peacefully. 
 
 Ten assembly constituencies, including two each in MP and Karnataka and one each in Asaam, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Delhi, Rajasthan and West Bengal, went for the bypolls.
 
 While the polling passed off peacefully in other areas, more than 10 people were injured in Ater after BJP and Congress workers exchanged fire and attacked each other with lathis and swords in this trigger-happy region. There were also reports of security forces firing in the air to disperse mobs. 
 
 Journalists were attacked and held hostage, vehicles wrecked, and guns boomed in Ater during the bypoll despite the presence of over 2,300 policemen and paramilitary forces.
 
 In a complaint faxed to chief election commissioner, Katare alleged that two criminals tried to capture booths. Six police SHOs were removed after Congress complaints in Ater, Phooph, Boomri, Bawai, Baroli and Sirpura.
 
 At Goarkala polling booth, supporters of both candidates exchanged fire, injuring at least six. 
 
 The violence was reported despite unprecedented security in Ater — there was one paramilitary jawan for 124 voters here, compared to 402 in Bandhavgarh. The turnout in Ater was a low 58.9% while Bandhavgarh saw over 67% voting despite the 40° heat.
