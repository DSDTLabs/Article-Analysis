MUMBAI: A 22-year-old woman has accused gangster Chhota  's younger brother Deepak Nikhalje (51) of raping her by promising marriage. The first-year engineering student also claimed Nikhalje assaulted her in 2016 when she was pregnant, causing miscarriage. 

 She approached the police on Sunday after Nikhalje's sister threatened her and demanded she stop harassing him. The police registered an FIR against Nikhalje and transferred the case to Navi Mumbai police as the woman alleged he first molested her at a farmhouse in Panvel and later raped her on several occasions. Nikhalje's two phone numbers mentioned in the FIR were not reachable.
 
  According to the woman, in 2014, when she needed financial help for private tuitions, Nikhalje's aide arranged a meeting with him. Nikhalje took her to his friend's bungalow and allegedly tried to get close to her. When she protested, he promised marriage. "He took her to hotels in Lonavla and had physical relations with her," said an officer. Later, when he refused to marry her, she messaged his wife and told them about their relationship. -S Ahmed Ali
