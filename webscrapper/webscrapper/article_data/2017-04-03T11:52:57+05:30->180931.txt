SHIMLA: A report of the   (CAG) has revealed that the losses of   (HRTC) increased by Rs 365.19 crore in five years, from Rs 653.45 crore in the 2011-12 fiscal to Rs 1,018.64 crore in 2015-16.

 The report, tabled recently in the state assembly, has cited poor operational efficiencies, a fare structure that did not match operational expenses, and the lack of a mechanism for route analysis between the state-owned corporation and private operators for the mounting losses. According to the report, HRTC’s net worth had “eroded” prior to 2011-12.
 
 Even as the losses rose by 56% in the five-year period, HRTC’s passenger share improved from 39.57% in 2011-12 to 45.80% in 2015-16. The report said the HRTC’s operational performance was below the all-India average among hilly states in respect of vehicle productivity, achievement of scheduled kilometres and fuel costs, depriving the state-run transporter of potential revenue of Rs 579.23 crore.
 
 According to the  , the HRTC consumed 498.38 lakh litres of fuel in excess of the all India average during 2011-16 resulting in extra expenditure of Rs 240.02 crore. The state government compensates the corporation for concessions and free passes for various sections of society. However, the corporation submitted its claims only on estimation basis and not on actuals, the report said.
 
 Of the total estimated claims of Rs 1,111.66 crore during 2011-16, the state government reimbursed Rs 895.00 crore, leaving Rs 216.66 crore unrecovered.
 
 There was no mechanism in place to ensure that burden of uneconomical routes were equitably shared by both the HRTC and private operators, said the report. It also said that no mechanism had been established to ensure reasonability of the price of a route permit and they were being allotted on an ad-hoc basis.
 
 CAG has recommended that the state government and HRTC should determine a criterion for allocation of routes between the corporation and private operators for an equitable distribution of uneconomical routes to ensure sustainable provision of transport services by both. It also recommended determining the price of route permits by adopting transparent procedures and institutional mechanisms.
