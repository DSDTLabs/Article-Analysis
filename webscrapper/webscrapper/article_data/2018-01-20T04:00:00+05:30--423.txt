Surat: Surat is on its way to become a slum-free city by 2022. Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has started building houses for nearly 80,000 slum dwellers of 354 slums pockets of the city. 

 SMC conducted a survey two years after central government’s announcement of housing for all by 2022 and found that there were at least 354 slum pockets in the city where 74,000 units were located and 80,000 people lived. 
 
 Two decades ago about 20 per cent of the population of the city lived in slums, but now the slums dwellers make up only 6.84 per cent of the total population. This could be mainly because SMC has been able to provide 97,000 slum dwellings families housing under different schemes. 
 
 “We plan to provide housing to urban poor of the city under schemes for economically weaker sections (EWS), low income groups (LIG) and middle income groups (MIG),” an officer of slum redevelopment department of SMC said.
 
 Around 8,110 apartment blocks are being built in Katargam, Mota Varachha, Dindoli and Vesu. These have been categorized as green houses and are coming up on SMC’s own plots through contractors. Thirteen projects to build 10,200 EWS houses are also underway and they are expected to be ready by 2019 end.
 
 Old SMC tenements will be rebuilt and occupants given new flats in redeveloped space under tenement redevelopment scheme. These schemes are going on at Althan, Anjana and Dumbhal and some 3,800 allotments would be made. All these schemes will be replicated in different areas by mid-2018 to meet the target of providing houses to 80,000 slum dwellers, sources said. 
 
 “We would comfortably relocate all the slum dwellers once these housing schemes are completed in the next four years. There is no doubt that we would be able to make our city slum-free in a short duration,” SMC deputy commissioner Ketan Patel said.
