AHMEDABAD: Touted as among the  , Madhapar, Baladia, and Kera in Kutch draw a large chunk of bank deposits from its residents settled in Africa. Some of the top construction, sugar, and cement companies in Africa are owned by Gujaratis, mainly from Kutch and  . This testifies to strong business links that Africa and Gujarat have enjoyed for decades. The   is a major market for pharmaceuticals, textiles, agriculture produce, ceramics, plastics, spices, agri-equipment, and auto parts to name a few. On the other hand, Gujarat imports pulses, sesame, and timber in large volumes from Africa. Rough diamonds mined in Africa are cut and polished in Surat, India’s diamond city.

 “Pharma exports from Gujarat to African countries is around Rs 8,000 crore and it is growing at 8%-10% annually,” said Chirag Doshi, former chairman of the Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association, Gujarat. For mid-sized companies, penetrating European and American markets is tough and therefore African and Latin American countries are ideal destinations for exports.
 
 Government data shows that Gujarat exported wheat, groundnut, fruits, onions, dairy products, among others, worth Rs 1,190 crore to Africa during the April-February period in the 2017 fiscal, while African nations exported wood and articles of wood worth Rs 1,186 crore to India during the same period. Kutch accounts for 70% of these imports. “A host of Gujaratis who have settled in African countries are major exporters of pulses. In fact, a huge amount of these exports are sent to India,” said Rajiv Vastupal, chairman, Gujarat state, FICCI.
 
 African Development Bank officials believe that there is ample scope for Gujarat-based players in power, infrastructure, services, agriculture, automobiles, and food processing sectors in Africa. Corporate houses have started looking at Africa for setting up manufacturing plants. Arvind Ltd established a garment-making plant, producing 3 million pieces, in Ethiopia last year. Apart from a 10-year tax holiday, duty-free access to the US, Europe, and 12 other countries have attracted the Ahmedabad-based textile-to-apparel giant to Ethiopia, which has a manufacturing facility of Cadila Pharmaceuticals as well. Sanghi Industries Ltd’s promoters are also mulling investments in Africa. However, raising debt in local currency as well as the volatility in some African currencies are seen as deterrents by the industry.
 
 Tourism is yet another sector where there is great synergy between Gujarat and Africa. According to Manish Sharma, a tour operator, around 30,000 people from Gujarat visit popular destinations such as South Africa and Nigeria every year. “Hundreds of farmers from Saurashtra have taken up agriculture in Africa,” said Parag Tejura, president, Saurashtra Vepari Udyog Mahamandal, which has been organizing Africa trade show for the past three years. “Exports and imports of agricultural produce and commodities are significant between the regions.”
