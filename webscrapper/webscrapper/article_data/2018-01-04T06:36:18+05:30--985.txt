BENGALURU: Two software engineers died on the spot after their car rammed a truck on Nice Road near Kengeri in west Bengaluru early on Wednesday. Prashanth G, 27, a resident of KN Block in Vidyaranyapura and his friend V K Akshay Kumar, of   near Magadi Road, were heading towards Bannerghatta Road when the accident took place at 6am. 

 “Prashanth’s office is in Domlur while Akshay Kumar works in  . Both were on leave on Wednesday. Based on their colleagues’ statements, we suspect that the duo might be going towards Bannerghatta or some other place for picnic,” police said.
 
 Prashanth was driving at the maximum speed when the accident took place. “A driver, who witnessed the accident, said Prashanth was overtaking a truck when the car rammed another truck which was moving ahead. Prashanth might have failed to notice the second truck due to morning mist,” police added.
 
 Akshay’s family members told police that Akshay, a bachelor, was staying at a PG near Bellandur. “He lived in Janapriya apartment, Kadabagere. As it was difficult for him to cover long distance between his office and home, Akshay had shifted to the PG last October,” Gangadhar H, a family member, said.
