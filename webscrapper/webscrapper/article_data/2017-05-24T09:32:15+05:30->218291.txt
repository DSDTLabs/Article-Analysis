 In a video which went viral on social media, Singh says, "I tried and helped out wherever I could. I took some who were looking for their loved ones to the hospital. They had no money and were stranded as the roads were closed. We stick together when it counts."
 
 Kaur said Sikhs would be taking part in a candle-light vigil in Albert Square on Tuesday evening to pay tributes to the victims lost and to console their families. They would also be there to offer tea and refreshments to the people.
 
 Amrik Singh of Sikh Federation (UK) said that Sikhs living and working in Manchester came out to aid those caught in the attack. "Sikh taxi drivers drove people away from the danger and gurdwaras opened their doors," he said.
 
 "The lives of 22, including children have been horrifically cut short by this evil act of terror. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and injured in this attack," he said.
