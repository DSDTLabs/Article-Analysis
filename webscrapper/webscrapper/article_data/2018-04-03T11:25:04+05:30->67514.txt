COIMBATORE: Heavy vehicles have been banned from using the new flyover at   for three months to facilitate the construction of the second flyover. The state highways department will also ban entry of all vehicles from 10pm to 6am to connect the columns on either side of the flyover, department sources told TOI.

 The 1.75km-long flyover, which begins near Park Gate and connects Dr Nanjappa Road to Sathyamangalam Road stretch, was inaugurated by chief minister   last November. Construction of the second flyover from Seventh Cross on 100 Feet Road to   near   had started last year. It requires 5.4m of vertical clearance from the first flyover.
 
 “Heavy vehicles like buses, trucks and commercial vehicles will not be allowed through the first flyover as we will carry out work to connect the columns. Only light motor vehicles and two wheelers will be allowed to use it for three months. The department has sent a letter to the city traffic police not to allow vehicles from 10pm to 6am till the construction work is over,” a senior official said. 
 
 After the officials restricted the entry of heavy vehicles on Monday morning, traffic jam was witnessed on Dr Nanjappa Road–Sathy Road stretch. Subsequent, city police deployed more than four traffic cops to regulate traffic.
 
 “We have requested the state highway authorities to finish the work within a month,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic)   said.
 
 The state government had allotted Rs 162 crore for the construction of the flyovers. As per the plan, the second flyover was expected to cover a distance of 1,226m. Now, the highways department plans to extend it by 52 metres towards the east till the electric crematorium at Avarampalayam. A tender will be invited soon for the extension work, sources said.
