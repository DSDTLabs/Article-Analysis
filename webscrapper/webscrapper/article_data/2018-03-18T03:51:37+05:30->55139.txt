The charity commission has restrained the   from taking possession of the   trust property situated at   till March 20.

 Marathwada Mitra Mandal secretary Mohan Deshmukh and one of its trustees  , a former assistant charity commissioner, had approached the state   seeking interim stay on the collector’s move to take back the land that was allotted to the trust in 1981.
 
  
 The collector had on February 26, 2018, ordered to take back the 11,000 sq mtr land belonging to the trust, which is mired in controversies. The applicants argued before the charity commissioner that the collector had not given them a chance of being heard and ordered to take back the land without following norms.
 
 On March 12, charity commissioner S G Dige ordered that “the respondent (collector) or his officers are hereby restrained from taking possession of the trust property situated at Bandra till next date.” He has placed the next date of hearing on the application on March 20.
 
 Deshmukh had pointed out that in 2009-10, the government had taken Rs 11.8 crore from the trust and allotted the land to it. “We had made an application to the government against the misuse of land by one of the trustees, former CM  . The government took cognizance of the representation and directed Mumbai collector to submit a report in this regard,” they contended.
 
 Deshmukh said that former CM S B Chavan was the founder president and trustee of the mandal. Later, Nilangekar was elected as the president of the trust. “Instead of carrying ahead the objectives behind formation of the trust, he allegedly chose to sell it off in a questionable manner without taking the trustees into confidence,” said Deshmukh, adding “Nilangekar had indulged in various financial irregularities involving the trust, funds of which he had used for his own purpose.”
