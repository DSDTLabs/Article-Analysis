MUMBAI: Pleading for a   of 10 years for   Khan, held guilty as a " " in the  , his lawyer Farhana Shah on Tuesday said he deserves parity with others convicted earlier in the case. 

 Shah said four other accused convicted and sentenced in 2007 by special TADA judge P D Kode, for a similar role of assisting in arms landing at Shekhadi jetty in Raigad and persuading young men to get arms training, were given only 10 years by SC in 2013 in the case. She urged special TADA judge G A Sanap, now presiding over the second trial in the case, to consider the roles played and said Karimullah is a mere 'arrow' and not the main conspirator of the blasts. There were no recovery of arms from him, she said. Judge Sanap, who had on June 16 held six of the seven accused on trial, guilty, is now hearing submissions on sentencing. One of the guilty accused, Mustafa Dossa, died last month. The judge said to Shah, "You say he is an 'arrow' but the prosecution says he is an 'archer'. The reference is to the   verdict which likened the main conspirators to archers and foot soldiers to 'arrows' to distinguish them for mitigating factors so the arrows are not given death sentence."
 
 Shah said the four others who played a similar role as Karimullah but were given 10 years were Khalil Nazir, Ejaz Pathan whose gang he was a member of, Shahnawaz Khan and Ehtesham. Special public prosecutor for CBI Deepak Salvi, who has sought death sentence for three of the five, will rebut once the defence completes its submissions.
 
 Karimullah's co-accused, Feroz Khan, submitted written submissions to show why he must be spared the death sentence. Abu Salem, whose extradition from Portugal has ensured that no death sentence is sought for him, will give his written submissions this week and will also argue that post-sentencing he be transferred to a jail outside Maharashtra on security grounds.
