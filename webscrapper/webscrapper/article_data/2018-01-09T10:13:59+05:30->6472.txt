  Police said the debt-ridden man has left a four-page note explaining why he was taking his life.
  
  Identified as Santosh Kumar Gupta (46), the victim hailed from Dabra in Gwalior district, Madhya Pradesh and had arrived in Agra on January 1 and checked into a hotel in Idgah area under Shahganj police jurisdiction.
  
  Gupta’s body was first spotted by hotel staff who entered his room at around 1:30 pm, when Gupta did not respond to calls or open his room’s door.
  
  A hotel staffer who did not wish to be identified said, “Gupta bought one airbag along with him and often spent time in the hotel room. On Monday, the housekeeping staff attempted to contact him twice and knocked at his door to clean the room, but he did not respond. When we checked his room through a window, we saw him hanging from the ceiling.”
  
  According to police, Gupta left a four-page letter explaining the reason for his suicide. He had taken a loan of Rs 65 lakh.
  
  Speaking with TOI, DSP Chaman Singh Chawda, who is also the circle officer, Lohamandi, said, “Gupta had lost over Rs 50 lakh due to demonetization. He blamed a BJP leader and his friend for not returning his money, so that he could repay others from whom he had taken the loan.
  
  “We will investigate the matter once the victim’s family reaches Agra and lodges an FIR. Gupta’s body has been sent for a post-mortem,” Chawda said.
  
  Police sources claimed that Gupta had given Rs 40 lakh to a Madhya Pradesh-based BJP leader at the time demonetization was introduced by the government and Rs 25 lakh to a friend, but none allegedly returned his money.
