Mumbai: State board schools will have to conduct   for class X students between February 15 and March 4. This is the second year that the state is conducting the online tests for its students to help them assess their interests while making a career choice.

 The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education in a circular to schools have asked them to assign a teacher for the tests. “All students appearing for SSC examination this year must be informed about the tests. Additionally, the school computers must be prepped and a teacher for the process,” said Krishnakumar Patil, secretary of the board. The aptitude test, a 40-minute exam with 150 multiple choice questions, will be conducted at the school in batches. 
 
 The results will be declared online in April and the report cards given along with SSC mark sheets. “The teacher in-charge will follow the online portal every day for updates. The test will be mandatory for all students,” said Patil. Last year, about 16 lakh students took the test. 
 
 School teachers said the board should have considered holding the test in class IX instead. “Students are already occupied with SSC exam. Holding the tests in class IX would also help them decide better,” said Uday Nare, teacher, Hansraj Morarji Public School, Andheri. tnn
