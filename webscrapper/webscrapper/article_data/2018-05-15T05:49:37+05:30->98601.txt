GANDHINAGAR: Spiritual guide from Indore,  , who had suggested the   project to then CM and now PM  , will be helping the state government envisage the project, he said on Monday in Gandhinagar. 

 Bhaiyyuji has a wide base in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra and counts many political bigwigs among his followers.
 
 Speaking to reporters, Bhayyuji said, "I met   government officials to discuss the Sant Nagari development plan. My role is to help the state government in envisaging the project. All financial and other aspects will be looked after by the state government."
 
 "It will be the first of its kind project in the country where contributions and lives of all major saints of all religions including Hinduism and Islam will be displayed," he said.
 
 Bhaiyyuji had shot to national fame when he acted as the mediator in the standoff between the Union government and Anna Hazare over the Jan Lokpal bill.
 
 The Sant Nagari will be developed over 200 hectares of land in the Sabarkantha district. The estimated project cost is Rs 575 crore.
 
 The project was envisaged by Modi around 2011 as the CM but due to non-availability of land it could not take off. The project will come up on the banks of the   near Dharoi dam in Vadali.
