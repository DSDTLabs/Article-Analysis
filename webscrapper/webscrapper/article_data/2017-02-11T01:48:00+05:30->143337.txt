MUMBAI: The shrinking green cover of   is under further threat as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has decided to set up an ‘operations and control’ (O&C) centre on a portion of Aarey close to the Western Express Highway in Goregaon.

 MMRDA’s metropolitan commissioner Praveen Darade said, “The O&C centre will monitor all   corridors that will come up in future. There are no trees on the land that we have sought from the Dairy Development Department.”
 
 However, this development on a vital green lung in the suburbs will be in addition to the 32-hectare-wide car depot that is to be built by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL) and a labour camp spread over 15 acres to house workers deployed for the Metro-II (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-VII (Dahisar-Andheri) projects.
 
 While the O&C centre will come up on four acres of land, another two acres will be required on a temporary basis to set up a casting yard.
 
 The decision is likely to fan resentment among citizens and environmentalists as Aarey, spread across 3,160 acres with over 4 lakh trees, has been steadily losing green cover due to encroachments and land allotments to both public and private bodies. Stalin Dayanand of the NGO Vanashakti said, “The government is acting in an arrogant manner and this decision proves it has no concern for the environment.”
