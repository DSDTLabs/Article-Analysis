The first song Tomake diyechilam chena chena kotha gulo from   starring   and   is out and people are loving it. “The song is peppy and melodious and I am getting positive feedback. The backdrop of London is also adding to the beauty of the song. But this is not the complete song. There are many more beautiful montages in the song which one will get to see it at the theatres only. The concept of the song is mine and I am happy that the audience is loving it. Arindom and   have lent their voices to the song and they have done a swell job. I still remember the day we were shooting this song in London. It was raining the day before but it became sunny just before we started shooting,” said Yash.
