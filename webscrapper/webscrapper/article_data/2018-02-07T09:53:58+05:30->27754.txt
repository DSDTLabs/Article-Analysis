LUDHIANA: The Punjab’s leading business association ––   and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) –– is working on a plan to use solar energy to replace the conventional heating systems in factories belonging to its members.

 CICU members Tuesday held a meeting with the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) and discussed the feasibility of this project.
 
 CICU president   said, “Several industrial processes require heating. These equipment are highly expensive and heating methods add to the running cost. In view of these factors,   is the best bet for the industry as it has low running cost and is completely nonhazardous.”
 
 “UNIDO, which works for the industry in different areas, will now help us get financial help from government bodies for the implementation of solar-powered heating systems in our factories. It will prove useful in high temperature applications and other applications including steam production, thermic fluid heating, air conditioning and incineration,” Ahuja added.
 
 The CICU president said, “Once we are through with all the formalities and have a plan of action, we will ensure that the majority of our members make use of this environment-friendly technique and cut expenditures.” 
 
 Dr Anil Misra, national project manager, UNIDO, addressed the industrialists and informed that UNIDO has teamed up with Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) to develop a financial package including the subsidy from the Union ministry of new and renewable energy and soft loan to support the installation of projects for industrial applications of heating and cooling.
 
 Other members present in the meeting included   Aul, S B Singh, Ram Lubhaya, Shiv Kumar, Rajesh Kumar, Sukhmeet Singh, S N Tiwari, Deepak Sharma, Ashwani Goyal, S K Soni, Jaswinder Singh, Hem Raj Mehta and Inderpal Singh.
