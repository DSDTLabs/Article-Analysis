Panchkula: Three days after a 16-year-old Karan committed suicide in Panchkula Sector 4 following the alleged   game, Haryana inspector general of police, CID, has sent a letter to all the telecom companies working in Haryana to keep a tab on the unnecessary messages and online links so as to avoid more such incidents.

 As per information given by the IGP, CID Anil Kumar Rao, who is also the head of digital investigation, training and analysis centre (DITAC), Gurugram, the telecom companies have been notified to update cops if they found anything suspicious going on in their network. “To avoid more such incidents through games and applications, we have issued an alert. Besides this, a special team is working on to identify the person or virus which is sending this link to the minors,” he said.
 
 IGP further said the recovery of data from Karan and the other kid’s mobile is under investigation.
 
 Apparently, cops have already issued an advisory to the parents and schools throughout Haryana. Through the advisor parents were told to monitor online activities of the kids, encourage outdoor activities, notice any abnormal behaviour like change in eating pattern, sleeping habit, depression, isolation or aggressive behavior. They were also advised to talk to their children regularly and in case of suspicion they were advised to consult a psychiatrist immediately.
 
 Schools were asked to encourage students to share computers, sensitize parents about the games. They were also told to keep an eye on any visible marks or wounds on the students’ bodies.
