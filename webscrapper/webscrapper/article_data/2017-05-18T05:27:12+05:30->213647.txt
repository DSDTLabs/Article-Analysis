NEW DELHI: After the   recruitment exam topper from Jammu & Kashmir,  , expressed his fears about his family’s security in the light of   officer Ummer Fayyaz’s abduction and killing in south Kashmir, the BSF, in coordination with the state authorities, has made “arrangements” to ensure their protection.

 “The BSF is taking care of his concerns, though there is no specific threat to him or his family. Things are being implemented,” a senior BSF officer told TOI but refused to share further details. The officer also made it a point to clarify that Wani had only pointed out concerns in the context of getting his sister a place in a hostel at Chandigarh, where she is studying engineering.
 
 When contacted, Wani, who is undergoing training at the BSF Academy near Gwalior, refused to speak, saying that he was bound by service conduct rules. “I have spoken to my seniors and it is for the BSF PRO to make any statement to the media,” he stated. Wani has topped the BSF recruitment exam last year.
 
 However, after Army officer Fayyaz was abducted and shot dead by terrorists in Shopian, aouth Kashmir, last week, he was quoted by a section of the media as saying that he was worried about what lay in store for him and his family as well as all those from the state who had joined the forces.
 
 Media reports had quoted him as saying that service personnel themselves should be allowed to carry personal weapons when travelling.
