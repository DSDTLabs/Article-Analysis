HYDERABAD: Criticising Governor   for his lavish praise of  , the Congress on Monday questioned the rationale behind such remarks by the head of state. 

 Speaking to media, opposition leader in the legislative council Md Shabbir Ali threatened to boycott the Governor. "How can a constitutional head like the governor compliment the CM? We are seriously mulling a proposal not to give him any more representations from the party," Shabbir said.
 
 He also questioned the basis for the compliments made by the Governor. "Are these compliments to KCR for not giving the CM post for SCs? Not giving three-acre land for Dalits? Not paying for students' fee or for not waiving farm loans?" he wondered. Echoing him, Congress leader Komatireddy Venkata Reddy said "The status and position of Governor has been lowered by Narasimhan with these remarks. The CM failed to fulfil many of his promises made during the elections including opening of Nizam Sugar factory. Under these circumstances, keeping the good of the people in mind, the governor should not have complimented the chief minister". 
 
  chief minister N   is learnt to have expressed displeasure with his ministers over the visible 'inclination' of the governor towards Telangana.
