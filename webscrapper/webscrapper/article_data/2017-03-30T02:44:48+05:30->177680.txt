MUMBAI: A   was averted as police halted north-bound traffic on   following a   pipeline burst below a   in   on Wednesday afternoon. Police said that a slight spark due to traffic on the flyover could have led to a disaster. 

 Due to the burst, there was no CNG supply at 19 gas stations—between Kandivli and Mira Road—till late in the night. This is likely to affect public transport like autos, taxis, fleetcabs and buses on Thursday morning.
 
 A source said that cooking gas supply too was affected in the western suburbs. Though a source in Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL) said that the cooking gas supply was restored in an hour, the CNG crisis is likely to continue on Thursday.
 
 K Ganesh, an auto driver, said, “There were long queues of vehicles outside gas stations. Pump owners said they were not certain when the supply would be restored.” Several auto drivers rushed to pumps in Goregaon and Jogeshwari, but there were long queues here too.
 
 An MGL spokesperson said: “The disruption will continue in Kandivli, Borivli, Dahisar, Mira Road and Bhayander as repair work is in progress. The pipeline was damaged during Metro project excavation work undertaken by MMRDA’s contractor. We expect restoration of gas supply in 24 hours.”
 
 MMRDA spokesperson Dilip Kawathkar said, “We will penalize the contractor but MGL had not informed us about the pipeline at the spot. We had called MGL representatives to identify location of utility lines.” However, an MGL official said they had been providing all information about their pipelines to MMRDA.
 
 Police has made a diary entry. After the leakage, police cordoned off the site and stopped traffic movement. “We had to plead to people to stop as most got agitated. It could have caused a law and order problem,” said senior inspector Avinash Sawant. “The gas was visible and had spread a few metres. We could smell it. The valves were turned off to plug the leak,” inspector Ravi Adane said.
