PATNA: Four   from Tiruchirappalli (Trichy) in Tamil Nadu were arrested on Friday for allegedly looting people in the state capital during the last several weeks. They were identified as Venkatesh Varan, Satya, Ganesh and Bandi Mutthukumar, all natives of   in Tamil Nadu.

 Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said they used to throw Rs10 notes around their targets to distract them for a few seconds and the gang members stole valuables and bags containing cash from their vehicles in the blink of an eye. He said the gang was involved in the Rs19 lakh loot from an SUV under S K Puri police station area a fortnight back. “They had also stolen a bag from a person in Pirbahore area a few days back. On April 3, they stole a bag containing Rs5 lakh and a pistol from an SUV on Budh Marg,” he said and added at least 20 other members of the gang were operating in   in three teams.
 
 The SSP said the gang has a pool of people to help them in seeking bail and other legal matters after getting arrested.
 
 He said a team of Bhopal police would reach Patna soon as the gang was also involved in several theft cases there with the similar modus operandi. He said they were in touch with Rajasthan police, too.
 
 Police sources said the gang committed several crimes in Allahabad from where it shifted its area of operation to Bhopal before finally reaching Bihar. “Soon after theft or loot, they pass the bags containing cash and valuables to a gang member who hands it over to his associates posing as passengers at Patna Junction,” they added.
