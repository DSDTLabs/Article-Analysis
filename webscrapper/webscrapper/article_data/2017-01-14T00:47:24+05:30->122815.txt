MUMBAI: A week after the shahi imam of Kolkata’s   Mosque, maulana  , issued a   against PM  , the controversial cleric faces a fatwa from a Mumbai-based mufti (one qualified to issue fatwas).

 In his fatwa, mufti Manzar Hasan Khan Ashrafi Misbahi, chief mufti of Madrassa Darul Uloom Ali Hasan Ahle Sunnat, has not only dismissed Barkati’s “fatwa” against Modi as an outrageous and condemnable political statement, he has also questioned the controversial imam’s credentials to lead namaz or prayers.
 
 “Such statement cannot be called a fatwa at all since the statement poses danger to the peace of society. This is his personal and political statement and Shariah doesn’t back such statements. …such a person cannot be an imam,” reads Misbahi’s fatwa, originally penned in Urdu. Misbahi claimed that Barkati is not a mufti (one who has been trained in ifta or a course in fatwa) and should not devalue the sanctity of fatwa by passing off his political statement as fatwas.
 
 Barkati disparaged the fatwa, saying, “Who is Misbahi? I have never heard his name. I don’t think one has to pay any heed to such statements. I will stick to all the statements I have made recently as they are for the betterment of society.” Last week, Barkati outraged many when he issued a fatwa offering a reward of Rs 25 lakh to anyone who was willing to “cut off Modi’s beard, shave his head and smear him with black ink”. The meeting where he issued the fatwa was chaired by Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali at the Kolkata Press Club.
 
 Misbahi has slammed Barkati also because the latter had “embarrassed” Muslims by leading funeral prayers in absentia of the liquidated al-Qaida chief   on May 6, 2011. Misbahi said on Friday, “Laden was a known terrorist and a confirmed terrorist cannot be a Muslim. So he didn’t deserve an Islamic funeral prayer.
 
 Yet Barkati led a prayer, creating schism among Muslims and bringing a bad name to the community. Muslims should stop offering namaz in his leadership.”
