LUCKNOW: All those using septic tanks in their houses for   will now have to ensure that only   authorized contractors clean the tanks so that the waste is disposed only at designated places. Over 50 % houses in the city use septic tanks. 

 LMC has designated 15 sewage pumping stations as the dumping spots for these tanks. It has directed   to register all private contractors who clean these tanks. Those found cleaning tanks without registration or even the registered ones, if found dumping sewage elsewhere, will be liable for penal action and penalty of Rs 10,000 each.   is currently registering machines at Rs 1,000 each and allotting them an ID number. Jal Sansthan's secretary   said, "The drive has been intensified over the past month to ensure cleanliness. We have to make residents aware about this move so that they don't hire unregistered contractors."
 
 This is the first time that the municipal corporation has tried to regularise dumping of sewage from septic tanks of the city.
