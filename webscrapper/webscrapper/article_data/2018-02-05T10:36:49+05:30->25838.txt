NAGPUR: Railway passengers wanting to hire a prepaid autorickshaw on Monday will suffer as over 400 members affiliated to Lokseva Prepaid Auto Chalak Malak & Taxi Sanghatna will be on a strike.

 President of the auto union   said the daylong strike is to draw attention of the   against allotment of parking space to Ola cabs inside the station premises. “These cabs have no RTO approval,” he said.
 
 Going through the bidding process, the Central Railway has awarded contract to Ola for 3 years at Rs35 lakh per year. Passengers have been long demanding Ola/Uber cabs at the station but due to opposition from auto drivers, these cabs were never allowed inside.
 
 Railway spokesperson & ACM SG   termed the strike as illegal. “We will provide security to passengers. The cab aggregator has been brought in as per railway policy and there is nothing illegal,” said Rao.
