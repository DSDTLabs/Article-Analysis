CHENNAI: A day after a Class X student died during a prayer meeting at his school in Thiru Vi Ka Nagar, police arrested the school’s headmaster and the physical education (PE)teacher.

 On analysing footage from CCTV cameras at the school,police found that students who came to school late were made to go on a ‘duck walk’ in the playground as punishment, which the victim’s parents alleged was the reason behind his death.
 
 Police, who initially registered a case under CrPC 174 (unnatural death), on Thursday altered the case to IPC section 304 (A) (causing death due to negligence) against Arul Lourdusamy, headmaster of Don Bosco Higher Secondary School, and PE teacher  . They have also booked them under the   Justice Act.
 
 The victim, M Narendran, had come 45 minutes late on Wednesday which led to the boy being punished, his father said. However, school authorities denied the allegations on Wednesday. The police on inspecting CCTV camera footage found that Narendran was among many students who was forced to go on a ‘duck walk’ in the sun.
 
 Following the punishment, the boy collapsed and was taken to a private hospital nearby. He was later referred to   where he was declared brought dead. 
 
 As the news of his death spread, the victim’s kin and parents of other students in the school staged a protest demanding action to be taken against the headmaster and the PE teacher. A few people also protested near Thiru Vi Ka Nagar bus stop on Thursday.
 
 Police sources said three students among the group that was punished narrated the incident. 
 
 “They gave a statement saying they were made to do a ‘duck walk’ and saw the victim collapsing on the ground in front of their eyes,” said a police officer. “We have recorded their statement too besides evidence from CCTV cameras.”
