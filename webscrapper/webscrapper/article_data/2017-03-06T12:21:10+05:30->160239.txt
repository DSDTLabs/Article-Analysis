 Addressing a press conference, Pawar said that the organization will start the second phase of the agitation from tehsil places on Wednesday which will gradually be extended to the entire district. He demanded that total ban would be possible only after 14% of liquor shops left out after the apex court ruling comes into existence are closed down.
 
 The apex court had on December 15, 2016 passed an order directing the governments to close down liquor shops within 500 metre radius of the state and national highways from April 1.
 
 It is mandatory on the part of the district collector and excise department SP to strictly implement the apex court order, Pawar said, adding that not a single liquor shop has so far been closed in Maharashtra. There are 525 liquor shops in the district out of which 451 are to be closed on or before March 31. However, instead of taking action, the district administration was trying to safeguard the liquor lobby which has the patronage of political bigwigs, Pawar claimed.
 
 The press conference was attended by Manisha Kate Bhosle, Shekhar Sarkate, Sarika Najane, Nitin Suraskar, Ashok Umratkar, Vinod Deotale and Yogesh Rathod.
 
 The judgment stated that no licences for liquor shops be granted in these areas. In order to ensure that this provision is not defeated by resorting to subterfuge, it would be necessary to direct that no exception can be made for grant of liquor licences in respect of those stretches of national and state highways which pass through the limits of any municipality corporation, city, town or local authority
