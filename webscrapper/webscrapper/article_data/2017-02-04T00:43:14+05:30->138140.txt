NEW DELHI: Two men who had robbed an elderly   of her life savings on January 23 were arrested by cops in Kirti Nagar on Friday. The men had come to Delhi from a village in West Bengal and had a history of involvement in similar cases. 

 Mohammad Iliyas and   were arrested from a slum near Inderlok from where they were planning to leave for West Bengal and eventually to Bangladesh. “A team led by Anil Sharma, SHO of Kirti Nagar, traced the duo after analysing the manner in which they had carried out the robbery,” said Vijay Kumar, DCP (West). “Technical analysis revealed their location near the slum cluster and a raid party went in.” 
 
 The men had entered the house of 65-year-old Sudesh Bhutani around 1am under the belief that it was empty. As they started breaking into the cupboards, Bhutani woke up. Holding her at knifepoint, the two forced the cancer patient to hand over the keys to her locker. Before leaving, they gagged her to prevent her raising an alarm. 
 
 The cops rounded up more than 100 criminals from the area who had a record of employing a similar modus operandi. They short-listed a few of them who were equipped with house-breaking equipment and finally zeroed in on Iliyas and Habibul.
 
 Iliyas, 40, had been released a few days earlier from imprisonment for a robbery-cum-murder in Punjabi Bagh. With the help of Habibul, 22, he kept an eye on the houses located on the main roads, paying special attention to the habits of people living in those houses. Once they were acquainted with the schedules of the people, the two struck, usually at night.
 
 Police said Iliyas was also involved in a robbery at Keshavpuram and in Ludhiana. In addition, a case of cheating had been registered against him at Sarai Rohilla. “Further investigation is in progress and the involvement of the men in other offences is being ascertained,” said a police officer. “We suspect the duo could be involved in 12 more cases in west and outer Delhi.”
