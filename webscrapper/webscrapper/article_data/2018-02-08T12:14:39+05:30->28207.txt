VADODARA: Students of M S University’s Faculty of Law will now get more choices when it comes to selecting a language during their studies. 

 So far, students pursing the five years   integrated law course had the option of selecting only German language as the other language during their studies in fourth, fifth and sixth semesters. 
 
 English is a compulsory language for students throughout their studies. 
 
 On Wednesday, a proposal to provide more language options to students of the faculty which was moved by senate member   was approved during the faculty board meeting. 
 
 “All students had to invariably select German as other language. Now, students can also select French, Hindi, Gujarati and Sanskrit as a language during their studies,” said Lakhani, who since quite some time was making efforts to ensure that students get more language choices. 
 
 The language options will be available to students provided that 15 % of the total student strength apply for the particular language. 
 
 For instance, if in a class of 150, 23 students opt for French as language option, they will be able to select French during their semester studies. 
 
 The decision will come into effect from the forthcoming academic year 2018-19.
