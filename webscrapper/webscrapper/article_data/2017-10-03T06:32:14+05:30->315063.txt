JALPAIGURI: A windy day with rain clouds hovering all across the sky , accompanied by drizzles could not dampen the   of the thousands of people -both   -who had gathered at a haat (weekly market) ground at Nagar Berubari in Jalpaiguri on Monday to  , a day after the nation observed it.

 This   had agreed to observe Muharram a day later to make way for the Hindus to hold a fair on the ground and immerse the Durga idols a day after the Dashami setting a bright example of harmony and brotherhood.
 
 Monday's Muharram was attended by thousands of people, irrespective of their caste, creed or religion in a similar fashion like on Sunday .
 
 “We live in a small hamlet and we have to be united. We are like one family . So there's no big deal if we have to postpon observing Muharram by one day ,“ said Nur Islam, secretary of the Nagar Berubari Muharram Committee.
 
 On Monday , Muharram in this small village -some 12 kilometers south from Jalpaiguri town -was observed with great fervour and devotion.
 
 Since Dashami was on Saturday , the organisers felt it would not be possible to organise the fair to give room for the haat. But the Muharram committee wrote to the administration saying they will delay their plans till Monday to accommodate the immersion on Sunday , on the day of the Muharram.
