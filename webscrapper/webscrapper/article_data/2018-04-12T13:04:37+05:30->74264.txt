PATNA: The state transport department and Patna district administration jointly conducted a ‘helmet and seat belt’ checking drive in the city on Wednesday and collected Rs1.50 lakh as fine from 454 drivers. The drive was conducted on Dak Bungalow roundabout, Hartali Mor, Kargil Chowk near   and Saguna Mor. 

 Transport secretary   said out of the 454 vehicles, 180 were two-wheelers. “The drive to ensure fastening of seat belt by the driver and the person on the front seat of a car will continue. The department has also roped in 18 enforcement officers to keep a tab on rule violators,” he said and added that commuters without helmets and seat belts would be fined.
 
 Those riding two-wheelers without helmets would be fined Rs100 for the first time and Rs300 the second time. For four-wheelers, the fine is Rs500 for the first time and Rs800 for the second time violation of rules. The habitual violators would also lose their driving licences. “If anyone is caught flouting the rules for the third time, his/her driving licence will be cancelled,” said Agarwal.
 
 The drive is a part of road safety initiatives taken with regard to the high rate of accidents in the state. “The aim is to create awareness among the masses and minimize the chances of road casualties. It will instill a sense of responsibility among the Patnaites who flout the road safety norms carelessly,” he said.
 
 “We will be conducting surprise inspections once a week from next week on any major road of the city. The department also aims to expand this drive to other districts also,” he said. 
 
 Vishal Singh of  , who was fined for not fastening seat belt on the first day of the drive, said, “It is a good start. We need strict laws like in big cities. It is just a start. Soon people will adopt good habits like using seat belts while driving cars.”
