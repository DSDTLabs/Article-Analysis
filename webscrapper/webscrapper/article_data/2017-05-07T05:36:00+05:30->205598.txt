NAGPUR: With the mercury rising every passing day,   Pandit Deen Dayal Institute of Medical Science and Human Research has decided to reach out to over 6,000 poor people by distributing free kits to help them beat the heat.

 The first such session was organized near railway station where 500 citizens received such kiys. The NGO has identified 10 busy areas across the city and will be carrying out the activity for the next 10 days.
 
 The kit consists of a white scarf, glucose tablets and cold water. Besides, the NGO is also distributing brochures about heat action plan for spreading awareness.
 
 NGO president Dr Viral Kamdar said, “Our aim is to spread awareness.   heat, which leads to sun stroke and dehydration, can’t be taken lightly. Citizens need to understand the severity of it because it can also lead to death.”
 
 “When we talk of summer, a white scarf is the most basic element. But poor people can’t even afford it. Hence, they roam around with an open head. They feel dehydrated and would lye idle, but can’t afford to take any measure,” he said.
 
 “Besides the poor, even middle-class people are lack awareness about the severity of heat, preventive measures, and call 108 for emergency service. Hence, we are distributing heat action plans to all the people passing by,” he added.
 
 The areas identified by the NGO are Teen Nal square (Itwari), Netaji Market, Jattarodi, Medical square, Meetha Neem Dargah, Nandanwan (Kalamna), Gaddigodam Square, Amardeep Anaj Bazar (Itwari), Panchsheel Square and Pratap Nagar Square.
 
 Besides, the NGO has been distributing free meals to the poor thrice a week during afternoon since the last eight months. Every Tuesday, food is distributed at Netaji Market, at Meetha Neem Dargah on Thursday, and near the railway station on Saturday.
