KOLKATA: A parked mini-truck, with rods dangerously jutting out of its carrier illegally, led to an accident on Suhrawardy Avenue in which one person suffered critical injuries in the head. 

 Police said the truck driver violated the rule and placed the rods protruding out of the carrier. Moreover, he did not have the usual warning sign — a red cloth or a light. 
 
 The incident took place around 6am on Thursday when the driver of a car, failing to notice the jutting-out rods, rammed into the truck parked on Suhrawardy Avenue near   close to Park Circus 4 No. Bridge. The car driver, Akbar Ali (51), incurred the most injuries, while three others travelling in the vehicle escaped with cuts and bruises. Ali, a resident of  , has been admitted to the surgical ward at  . 
 
 The police said they have identified the truck driver and arrested him. The truck as well as the car have been seized. A case has been registered at the Beniapukur police station.
 
 Even as the exact cause of the accident is yet to be established, the police confirmed that the truck did not follow the safety guidelines of hanging a red cloth or a light to indicate it was carrying dangerously placed goods. Though the cops said the truck was parked by the road, Ali claimed the truck had suddenly slowed down and so, he could not control his vehicle and rammed into it.
 
 Three years ago, the road transport ministry had deleted Section 93 of Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, which allowed goods vehicles to carry poles, rods or indivisible load “as long as the projecting part or parts did not exceed the distance of 1 metre beyond the rear-most point of the vehicle”. 
 
 But drivers continued to carry such objects. More than 10,000 people die on Indian roads due to the violation of this norm. At present, truck drivers don’t even follow the practice of fixing blinkers at the end of protruding objects to warn vehicles coming from behind.
