SURAT: The Gujarat Bank Workers’ Union (GBWU) has supported the statement of the   ( ) general secretary C H   blaming the Reserve Bank of India’s negligence for cash crunch in banks.

 Venkatachalam has warned that if timely action is not taken to improve supply of currency notes, AIBEA will be compelled to ventilate the anger and agony of banking public through agitations.
 
 According to Venkatachalam, unusual cash crunch in the banks in many states has resulted in bank employees facing public anger. Customers are abusing bank staff for no fault of theirs. 
 
 The problem, according to the AIBEA, started with government’s decision to print Rs 2,000 notes. If withdrawing of Rs 1,000 notes was to prevent hoarding of black money, hoarding has only become easier with Rs 2,000 notes. 
 
 General secretary of   stated that the AIBEA has noted that ATMs of the banks are not yet recalibrated to allow newly designed notes. On the other hand, RBI is not supplying banks with the required currency, resulting in shortage of currency in the market. 
 
 The AIBEA has noted that government is trying to push its agenda of digital banking. Hence, there is a doubt whether the government was deliberately printing less currency notes, he said. 
 
 RBI governor had made a statement that adequate currency notes were being printed. Then where have the currency notes gone? Are they not to ensure that the banks have enough cash to meet the requirements of customers. RBI has increasingly becoming irrelevant because it has become an appendage of the government, the AIBEA had observed.
 
 The AIBEA has called upon the central government and RBI to remove fears of the people with regard to the banking sector.
