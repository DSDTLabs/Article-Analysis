LUCKNOW: In a severe indictment, the committee formed by the state government to probe irregularities in Rs 1,500-crore   has nailed down the then chief secretary Alok Ranjan, principal secretary, irrigation, Deepak Singhal and over a dozen engineers for their   and   in favouring contractors. 

 The report of the committee has been sent to a panel constituted by the CM. Cabinet minister Suresh Khanna is heading the panel, with revenue board chairman Pravir Kumar, additional chief secretary, finance,   and principal secretary law and justice, Rangnath Mishra, as its members. 
 
 This panel would now recommend whether criminal cases should be registered against those indicted, or a   inquiry should be initiated along with departmental proceedings.
 
 The committee headed by retired chief justice Alok Kumar Singh has blamed Ranjan and Singh for misappropriation of funds, favouring tenders to certain firms, inflated rates of the tender items, gross insensitivity towards the environmental issues and abject lack of transparency in the entire project.
