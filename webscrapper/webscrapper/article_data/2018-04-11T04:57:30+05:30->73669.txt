KOLKATA: A body found on Digha railway tracks on April 7 was identified as that of 19-year-old Rahul  , a resident of Behala’s Sarsuna. He had gone missing on April 6.

 Shaw, a resident of the   area, had gone missing after leaving a mess in  , where he had been residing for work purpose. According to police, the victim’s relatives travelled to   on Tuesday and identified the youth.
 
 Family members said the victim, who studied at a city college, also had a part-time sales job. On April 5, Shaw had lost his phone at the mess. “Hence, he decided to travel to Kolkata on April 6 and purchase a new phone. He was scheduled to return to Rampurhat by April 9,” said a source.
 
 According to cops, the Digha GRP found the body lying on the   railway tracks but its face was beyond recognition.
 
 The GRP began looking for people who might have gone missing in the past few days at the adjoining villages but found no links. They then began searching at the hotels. “We got information that a youth had checked in on the night of April 6 but checked out the next morning. We matched the documents and informed Shaw’s family,” said an officer. The body was handed over after the postmortem.
 
 Police sources said they are investigating why the victim came to Digha. “The nature of injuries shows he was hit by a train. At the moment, it seems unlikely that he was forced on to the tracks. It is possible that someone had murdered him before throwing the body on tracks. Even suicide or accidental death can’t be ruled out. We will speak to his family members and relatives and the 20 boarders at Rampurhat,” an officer said.
 
 Cops said the mobile call records have so far not yielded any leads.
