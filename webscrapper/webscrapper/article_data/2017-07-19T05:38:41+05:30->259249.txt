KOLKATA:   top brass on Tuesday held a meeting with the members of Deshapriya Park Durga Puja committee and asked them to outline their plans for this year.   has been a crowd-puller over the last two years. While the puja had to be shut down after it crippled entire south Kolkata in 2015, the cops had a harrowing time managing the crowd — and the traffic — last year.

 Senior officers insisted that it was a first step to prepare for the  . “We will eventually meet all puja organizers. It is important to meet them to make a holistic plan. With rain expected this season, we want to be ready for all challenges,” said an officer who was present at the meeting. 
 
 Talking about Tuesday’s meeting, he added: “You can say this is our homework to know what is expected of us.” 
 
 The organizers, however, claimed that police have asked them to reduce the size of the Thai temple that is being replicated at the spot. Police officers have denied any such claim. 
 
 Another meeting has been planned next month where the cops will issue some guidelines to the puja committee. “We will tell them to stick to our guideline. In addition, we have asked them to share their plans with us so that we can prepare traffic and security plans accordingly,” said a senior IPS officer.
 
 In 2015, 11 people were injured and scores complained of suffocation as pandal-hoppers — including kids — tried to stream into the Deshapriya Park ground on Panchami. The effect on traffic was disastrous. The entire south Kolkata stood still through the night. Sensing the risk, the cops shut down access to the ground for the remaining puja days. “We are anticipating a huge crowd and we want to be ready for it. With more than 60% cars in a 10-km radius heading to Deshapriya Park, it needs both planning and cooperation from the organizers,” said a top traffic officer.
