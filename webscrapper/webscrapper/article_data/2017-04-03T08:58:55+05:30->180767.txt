BATHINDA:   has decided to approach the Supreme Court against its order banning serving of liquor at pubs, restaurants and hotels up to 220 metres of national and state highways.

 The association has also called upon the state government to use its discretion to take over the roads under the MC to avoid closure of bars and  . The decisions were taken in an emergent meeting of the Punjab Hotel Association held at Bathinda on Sunday. Hoteliers from Patiala, Fazilka, Muktsar, Ludhiana, Faridkot, Bathinda and other places assembled to deliberate on the issue
 
 Association president Satish Arora said, “Hotels on the highways may fall out of business as the chances of hotel industry’s survival are very bleak without serving liquor to its customers”. He further added that hotel industry is already in the red with occupancy rate very low and the latest directive will ruin the hoteliers, bar and restaurant owners having their establishments near highways.
 
 He said the state excise authorities had made them to deposit the license fee to serve liquor on March 30 and now it will have to return to hoteliers. He further said that lakhs of people are associated with the industry and their future too would become bleak with closure of such units.
 
 The hoteliers said they should be given at least two years to shift to places away from highways and the union government should compensate to overcome the loses to be incurred in shifting to other places.
