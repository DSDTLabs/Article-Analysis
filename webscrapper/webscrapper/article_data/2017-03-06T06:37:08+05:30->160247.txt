 The grooms were dressed in suits and wore safa, while their brides shone in bridal-wear, with mindhol (a pearl-studded accessory) on their forehead. As the couples entered, women started singing mangalashtak (a typical Gujarati wedding song). The couples then went through wedding rituals which ended with the exchange of garlands. The feast included undhiyu, shrikhand, and khaman-dhokla. The couples were given a felicitation certificate.
 
 Shahrad Shah (77), a retired lawyer and former principal of a Mehsana-based law college, was present with his wife Ila Shah, who performs a culinary show on various TV channels. “We married in 1966 and we have been happy ever since,” Shah said. “Small sacrifices and commitment are key to a happy marriage. Hardships last for the initial two to three years.”
 
 Saroj Dave (74), a retired primary school teacher, and her groom Gunvantrai Dave (77) were part of the ceremony. “I completed the 50th year of married life in May last year,” Dave said. “Our life is happy because we respect and love each other.” Jaysukh Vakharia (76) who married Kalaben (71) on March 2, 1967, said: “Old is gold and golden jubilee is great!”
