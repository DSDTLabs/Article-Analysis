It has taken 17 years and a project like KriArj Entertainment’s ' ' to reunite   and   on the big screen. Interestingly, the artistes, previously seen together in ' ' (1999) and ' ' (2000), won’t be paired opposite each other in the musical comedy. 
Anil says, “'Fanney Khan' is an exciting journey for me. I have always admired Aishwarya’s craft and it’ll be interesting to work with her again, after so long. This is also my first project with KriArj Entertainment. I am happy to join hands with such creative minds, who know the pulse of the audience. They’re talking about all the right things in the best of ways and the kind of cinema they make is exemplary of the fact that one doesn’t have to make a big movie to make a movie big.” He adds, “T-Series is partnering with us, which means that our film will feature some fantastic music. What makes this partnership even more significant is the fact that music plays an important role in the story, which revolves around the life of an aspiring musician.” 
 Anil is also gung-ho about teaming up with Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s company, ROMP Pictures. He sums up, “All their productions have an innate sense of honesty, vulnerability and rawness that the audience can relate to. The same ethos will reflect in this film. Perhaps the most fun and gratifying part of the film is developing Fanney Khan’s character. He is lovably flawed and celebrates the extraordinary in the ordinary even as his life goes through bizarre twists and turns.”
