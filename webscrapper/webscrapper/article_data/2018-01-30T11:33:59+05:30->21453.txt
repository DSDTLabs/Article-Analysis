GAYA: About 2,000 autorickshaws are off the roads for the last three days badly affecting normal life in   including business, medicare and schools. The autorickshaw drivers are on strike demanding withdrawal of the new system introduced on the station premises ending single charge for daylong operations. 

 As per the previous arrangement, auto drivers were required to pay Rs 15 for 12 hours use of the parking space irrespective of the number of entry and exit. Now, the auto operators are required to pay Rs 15 for each entry and exit, an arrangement unacceptable to the auto drivers. According to Left activist  , “The new arrangement was unfair to the auto drivers. The old system should continue.” Autorickshaws have replaced cycle rickshaw as the most popular mode of local conveyance for the low income group people of the town and as such disappearance of autorickshaws from city roads has resulted into major shrinkage in business transactions.
 
 Meanwhile,   on Monday discussed the issue with railway authorities. Sources say that efforts were being made to arrive at a solution. One formula being discussed pertained to conversion of Rs 15 for 12 hour system into Rs 30 for 24 hours.
