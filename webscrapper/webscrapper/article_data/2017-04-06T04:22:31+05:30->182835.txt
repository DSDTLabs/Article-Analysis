MUMBAI: The state government is set to allow the blackand-yellow cabs to operate as “ordinary-cum-AC“ taxis in Mumbai. An air-conditioned ride is proposed to cost 25% more than the normal fare, sources in   said on Wednesday.

 “This is my original idea from the time when I used to travel in a taxi. I discussed it with the unions after learning that they have been demanding it for a while now.The transport commissioner's office has been directed to work out a new costing formula. A notification will be announced soon,“ said transport minister  , who held a meeting on the issue at Mantralaya on Wednesday.
 
 “Most taxis are new models with in-built ACs and this will give passengers the choice whether they want the AC or not. Once this is allowed for an extra charge, taxis will compete with the app-based taxis,“ said a transport ministry official.
 
 Not everybody is that enthused. At the moment, a ride in an aggregator cab --always AC -costs as much as 20% less than kaali-peeli fare. “With the proposed 25% hike for AC fares for taxis, the cost of a ride could be 40-45% higher than by   or Uber,“ said transport expert  . “If you compare with the sharepool cabs of Ola and Uber, the fare per passenger will drop further,“ he added.
 
 Taxi union leader A L   welcomed the decision.“This has been our union's demand for two years. Most of our cars are new models with in-built AC. There are several commuters who demand AC and are willing to pay 10-25% extra, especially during summer. However, when our drivers offer this service, they are caught by traffic cops (they target kaali-peelis with the windows up). But soon, it will be legal to charge extra for AC rides.“
 
 Asked about the exorbitant rates compared to aggregator cabs, Quadros said it was just an “option“. “It will not be compulsory for riders to opt for AC, as we will operate as ordinary taxis and AC will be only on demand,“ he added.
