NEW DELHI: Continuing with BJP’s massive   outreach campaign, seen as having paid rich dividends in the recent UP assembly polls, Prime Minister   will embark on several new initiatives coinciding with the 126th birth anniversary of Dalit icon Dr   on Friday.

 The Prime Minister will visit Nagpur to pay homage to Dr Ambedkar while his ministerial colleagues will also fan out across the country to join the celebrations. During recent   meetings, Modi and party president   had repeatedly insisted on concerted efforts to eulogise Dr Ambedkar. The party’s massive victory in UP is being attributed to support from a large chunk of the Dalit voters.
 
 “I am extremely honoured to be visiting Nagpur tomorrow (Friday), on the very special occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti,” Modi tweeted on Thursday. “In Nagpur, I will pray at Deekshabhoomi, a holy spot that is very closely associated with Dr Ambedkar. A series of development projects are going to be inaugurated in Nagpur, which will have a positive impact on people’s lives,” he added. Modi will launch several initiatives for digital payments. He will also felicitate the winners of a mega draw of the two major incentive schemes.
