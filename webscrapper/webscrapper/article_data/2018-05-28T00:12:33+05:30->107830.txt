NEW DELHI: Two   allegedly   by jumping in front of a   near southeast Delhi’s   on Sunday evening. Cops recovered a   from a bag lying near the bodies.

 DCP (railways)   said that the victims have been identified as   (16) and Urvashi (17). An inquest under section 174 of the CrPC has been initiated for further investigation.
 
 Police said the incident was reported to them at 6pm. The bodies were taken to a nearby hospital where the doctors declared them brought dead. A preliminary probe revealed the suicide note, suspected to be written by Meenakshi.
 
 “She apologised to her father and other family members for taking the step and has asked them to take care of themselves. There is no conclusive reason for the step given in the note,” an officer said.
 
 However, Meenakshi’s brother told cops that she was depressed for the past year since their mother’s death. Cops suspect this to be one of the possible reasons. They are also checking if there was any academics-related stress.
 
 The death of her cousin is being probed. Cops suspect Urvashi may have died trying to save Meenakshi, since no suicide note was recovered from her. Both the girls lived in Ghaziabad.
 
 The family members of both the girls are being probed for more details about the incident. Cops are also going through the mobile phones of the victims and their parents. CCTV cameras around the station and nearby places are also being scanned.
 
 It is also being checked how they managed to reach Tughlakabad from their homes.
