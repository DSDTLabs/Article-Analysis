CHENNAI: A pre-feasibility study by a   on ferrying cargo and passengers across 10 inland waterways in   will be ready next month. Based on the report, a feasibility survey will be carried out and the project is expected to be ready in three years. 

 “After we receive the report, we will decide which routes to take up for further studies. It will take around three years for the project to be commissioned after the studies are ready,” an official in the   said. 
 
 Speaking at a familiarisation programme, Captain  , former director of the Indian National Ship Owners Association, said, “The government should look at an RTO format in   There is no need to apply international rules for domestic shipping.
 
  All we need is simple small ships that can connect ports, while rail and road transport can act as last mile connectivity.” Subhedar said domestic shipping by waterways was more economical than by road or rail. “A 5% shift in cargo from road to ships will mean that 200 million tons of fuel can be saved.
 
  The cost of moving cargo by rail is high. It costs Rs 8 per ton per kilometre by rail for a rake while it will cost only Rs 3 per ton per kilometre by ships.”
