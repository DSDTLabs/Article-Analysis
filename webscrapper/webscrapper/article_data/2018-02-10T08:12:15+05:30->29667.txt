BANGARMAU (UNNAO): Panic among the residents of   under the grips of an   is driving many to relocate over fears of banishment.

 Mukesh* of Premganj is one of them. His elder sister was engaged to a man from the neighbouring Hardoi district and the family happily making arrangements for the wedding. But the would be in-laws of his sister have stopped taking their calls since the news of   infections in Premganj and two adjoining villages made headlines. When Mukesh tried to contact them through a mediator, they called off the match. “No one in my family is infected, but moving away seems to be the only option left for us. Otherwise who will marry my siblings, including four sisters?” Mukesh asked.
 
 Shivam (45), a class-IV civic employee, lives with his mother (80). Both tested negative for HIV, but he feels ostracised by relatives. Life is no better at work either. “My colleagues have started ignoring me,” he said.
 
 Ratnesh (28) tested positive and is devastated. A Class VIII dropout, he lives with his two sisters and parents in Premganj and works as a “palledar” in Galla Mandi. “A grocer refused to sell things to me. My friend has suggested I shift from here. I know the time has come to leave Premganj,” he said.
 
 However,   chief medical officer S P Chowdhary said there was no need for panic. Health teams will hold check-up camps, where counsellors will be available, with ‘nukkad natak’ teams roped in as well to spread awareness, he said.
