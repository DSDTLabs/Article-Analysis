THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Scientists, who participated in the   as delegates, plan to submit a proposal to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, which aims at promoting and integrating scientific principles to offer solutions to societal needs. 

  It would set a unique model for the country, they said, indicating that advanced robotics and conservation biology can help in conserving the resources. Conservation expert Satyabhama Das Biju proposed to set up a web portal to map the critically-endangered species and details on ways to conserve them, while Prahlad Vadakeppat proposed robotics and artificial intelligence with Internet of Things to offer scientific solutions to the pressing needs of society. 
 
  Vadakkepat, lead scientist in robotics and associate professor at the  , is exploring the possibility of India's collaboration on robotics research. With IEEE Kerala and   ( ), he had tried to promote startups in robotics with the support of local industries. "Discussions were held with industrialists, academia, engineers and end users on the need for further robotics research, to support start-ups in the field and to develop various products that would be useful for the household and industry," he said. Noted wildlife conservationist S D Biju said there is no data available on the endangered species and many species are dwindling over the years. "In our proposal, we would seek government support in setting up a web portal for critically-endangered species with details and maps," Biju said. 
 
  Statistician and astrophysicist A M Mathai raised concerns over the fact that the central fund for scientific research has been reduced. 
 
  Scientist in molecular chemistry,  , a former professor of chemistry from IIT Madras, who has developed several technologies to remove contaminants from drinking water, said: "The state has to look at ways to promote scientific research from the basic level by improving the education system," he said.
