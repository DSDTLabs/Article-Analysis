 Hubballi: The young talents of north Karnataka always felt the need of a repertoire that can expose and nurture their talent like Ninasam which is doing so through its Tirugata, a tour of theatre troupe. 
 
 The city-based Sanskrit College in the city has come forward to meet the demand albiet in a very small way. Under Sanskriti Payana, a team of 22 students will stage Sampoorna Sadarame, a play written by Bellave Naraharishashtri in 21 selected places in Karnataka starting Monday. Veteran theatre artiste and activist Arundanti Nag will kick start the payana on Monday.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Nataraj Honnavalli, principal, Sanskriti College of Visual and Performing Arts, Hubballi, who has directed the drama, said: “For the first time we are launching a repertoire to stage plays by touring various places in the state. As it is the first attempt, we are staging play in only 21 places including Shimogga, Sagar, Mysuru, Hubballi, Tumkur, Davangere, Chitradurga, Nagamangal etc. The team members are undergoing a rigorous practice to present a powerful performance.”
 
 “Going by the kind of response we get, we will decide about extending this to all places in the state from next year, he added.
 
 Student Ajaya Nag, who is playing the role of Aadi Murty in the drama, said: I am really excited that for the first time I am performing on stage. This is a musical drama with more than 20 songs. It is now a short term repertoire, and we want to grow it into bigger one in coming days.”
 
 Anjana R, from Bengaluru, who is playing the character of Sadarame, said, he was into modelling earlier before joining the diploma. “I am very thrilled that I am playing Sadarame role. I am waiting Payana to take off.”
 
 This play is about a woman by name Sadaramae who falls in love with a King and how she encounters problems in her life and how she gets over them with her ability, she added.
