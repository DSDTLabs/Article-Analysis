NEW DELHI: Senior officials of the   government and the transport minister have written to the Delhi government in April requesting to visit the   Gate inter-state bus terminus.

 Special commissioner (transport) KK Dahiya confirmed about the request and said that the state is planning an infrastructure along the same lines. Delhi has three ISBTs — Kashmere Gate, Sarai Kale Khan and Anand Vihar. The Kashmere   one has been recently upgraded, with the other two also in queue for renovations.
 
 The visit by UP mandarins is expected to happen this month, Dahiya said, adding that various facets of the infrastructure and facilities would be shared with the officials. “We have been working on upgrading the Kashmere Gate   for some time now. The building has been restructured with new arrival and departure bays, state-of-the-art waiting area and various other facilities.”
 
 The terminal will be seen as a blueprint for the structure that is being planned by the UP authorities, Dahiya said.
 
 The Delhi transport department has planned to introduce new facilities at the Kashmere Gate ISBT like a separate waiting area for women that will be manned by women personnel, he said.
 
 The department recently diverted around 100 hundred buses from the terminus to decongest the area. Buses from Haryana and Rajasthan have been diverted to Sarai Kale Khan, via NH-8. Most of these buses take the road to Jaipur, and enter Delhi via Dhaula Kuan and NH-8.
