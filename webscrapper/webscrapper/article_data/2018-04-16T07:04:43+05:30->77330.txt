BENGALURU: In another instance of trees being chopped down to increase visibility of advertisement hoardings, about 10 trees on the  ,   were reduced to stumps.

 Pankaj Dhiman, who posted a picture of the chopped trees on Facebook, said the trees were growing on the median on the Outer Ring Road, adjacent to a hoarding promoting ‘antibacterial innerwear’.
 
 “There is no doubt the trees were cut down to improve visibility of the hoarding,” said Vijay Nishanth, an environmentalist.
 
 He said the trees were most likely of the Thespesia populnea (behendi) and Tabebuia rosea (pink poui) variety. “This is the second or third instance in Mahadevapura alone. As per a Lokayukta order last year, if an advertising agency is found to have caused damage to a tree, the BBMP is required to remove the hoarding and cancel the licence,” he pointed out.
 
 Nishanth said he and others intend to file an FIR against the owner of the hoarding on Monday. He said the assistant conservator of forests (ACF), BBMP, had promised to take action against the culprits.
 
 G R  , deputy range forest officer (RFO), BBMP, confirmed the trees had been cut, but had no idea who had done them.
 
 “Some small trees were partially cut in Mahadevapura, and the matter is under investigation. We are unable to share any more information at present,” Kumar said.
 
 In March last year, 17 trees were poisoned, while in another instance branches of 13 trees were cut on the Outer Ring Road between   and Chinnappannahalli to improve visibility of hoardings. The BBMP woke up to the menace and pulled down two hoardings.
