When debutante director   speaks about his film,  , his eyes literally light up at the slightest mention of the characters played by his lead cast   and Shanayana Katwe, namely   and  . The film, says the director, begins with Abhimanyu as a final year engineering student — a naughty yet honest kind of a guy who has 100% clarity about what he wants to do in life. His attitude and arrogance in some parts of the film will stay with audiences, as will his passion and dream about his life. 
Aditi, on the other hand, explains Raghavanka is very intense, yet level-headed girl who is also very focused about the direction of her life. In fact, her focus is such that people around her call her ‘textbook’. Her drive in life also stems from the fact that she is like a second mom to her younger sister Aadya. 
 Both characters, says the filmmaker, take origin from his own deep-rooted feelings. “Aditi is born due to the father in me; I would want my daughter to grow and be like Aditi, while Abhimanyu is a reflection of my attitude towards life,” Raghavanka signs off.
