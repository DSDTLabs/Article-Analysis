AHMEDABAD: After protests from city-based activists, construction of a toilet adjoining  , a monument protected by   ( ), was stalled. The toilet was allegedly commissioned by Khadia police for its Astodia Police Chowky.

 According to Shamshad Pathan, a city-based activist, he came to know about the issue from two locals. “I was surprised to know about this as any construction within a radius of 100 metres of the protected monument has to be approved by the ASI. 
 
 There was no such permission sought in this case. Thus, we decided to take up the issue with Khadia police and seek answers,” he said.
 
 City-based activists had decided to hold a protest but by Sunday afternoon the workers had started dismantling the construction. G S Shyan, inspector of Khadia police station, could not be reached despite several attempts. 
 
 ASI has already filed multiple complaints for encroachments around protected monuments in the city.
