 Shibin's parents said that their r son was facing an inquiry on alleged misbehavior with his colleague. 
 
 "He was framed with false charge by his senior officials since he acted against the corrupt practice of seniors in his previous 41 battalion by filing an RTI with Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). He filed an RTI on 24 September 2015 to know about the facilities for a jawan,'' said the parents.

 However, he was reinstated to service in pending inquiry on December 2016 after his parents sent a petition to the PMO and defense minister. 
 
 "We do not trust the current investigation team and the team is headed by same corrupt officers, who took the action against our son,'' said the parents. 
 
 Shibin is married to Sophiya, a school teacher.
