KOLHAPUR:   (KMT) buses reported an increase in the number of passengers by about 10% on Tuesday owing to the   in the city. 

 On a normal day, the average passenger count is around 98,000 while the same was 1.08 lakh on Tuesday. All of the KMT’s 114 buses were plying at full capacity during morning peak hours. The number, however, started declining by afternoon, when the rickshaws started plying gradually. 
 
 A senior KMT official said, “On normal days, some of the buses are off the roads for maintenance. Since we knew of the strike earlier, the preparations to deploy all the buses on major routes in the city were done. Short distance commuters were benefited in a big way.”
 
 On Tuesday, the effective distance travelled by the KMT buses reached up to 33,000 km, said the official.
 
 All the passengers using rickshaws regularly did not turn up for the public transport and efforts will be needed to woo people to use KMT bus service, said the official. “Also, joint efforts will be required between transport officials and KMT to act against illegal autos.” 
 
 Currently, the KMT incurs losses to the tune of around Rs 2 lakh daily, although the losses reduced a bit after new buses were added to the fleet. The total number of passengers has increased since the last two years due to improved services and awareness among people to use public transport.
