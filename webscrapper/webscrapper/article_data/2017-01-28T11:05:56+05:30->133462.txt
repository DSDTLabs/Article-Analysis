ROHTAK: With merely a week left for Punjab elections, a large number of leaders across political parties made a beeline to Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda on Friday, but dera chief   remained non-committal over extending support to any political party or candidate in the February 4 polls.

 Among those who visited Dera Sacha Sauda on Friday included Punjab cabinet ministers   and   and Congress MLA Amarinder Singh Raja Warring, who is contesting from Gidderbaha in Muktsar district, and former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal.
 
 The politicians from Punjab reached the dera headquarters around 2 pm and were taken to the Sach Khand hall where the entry of newspersons and outsiders was barred.
 
 They held talks with Gurmeet Ram Rahim for about 50 minutes after being introduced by the dera's political affairs wing members.
 
 Sources said the dera chief met the leaders at the same time, but remained non-committal over extending support to any specific party or candidate in the poll fray.
 
 Interestingly, the politicians who visited the dera also included candidates from   (AAP), which refuses to be part of dera politics to win an election. AAP candidates Malkeet Singh from Guru Harsahai and   from Ferozepur were among the visitors on Friday.
 
 The practice of seeking dera chief 's blessing by political parties started in 2007 as it wields enormous clout in Malwa belt of Punjab.
