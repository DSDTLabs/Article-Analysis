 “The study conducted by the Sri Ram institute has clearly found that   should be able to raise a revenue up to Rs 1922 crore through toll-tax but they raise only Rs 350 crore. Where does the rest of 1500 crore go?” Maken alleged. 
 
 Maken also took pot-shots at AAP-led Delhi government, “Their symbol is a broom but they have only humiliated safai karamcharis. If they had implemented the 4th Delhi finance commission, most of the financial problem would have been solved”

Farhad Suri, leader of opposition in south corporation said, “East corporation has not paid the pensions for over 44 months, north corporation for over two years and south corporation for 20 months.
