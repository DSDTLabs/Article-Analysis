Seat allotment in mechanical engineering, electrical and electronics engineering, civil engineering and information technology were 9,615, 8,773 and 2,655 respectively. The total number of streams available are 29.

 Experts attribute highpaying jobs in computer science as the only reason why majority of the students end up opting for that stream.“Recruitment is comparatively higher in computer science than other fields. Even the average package offered by companies to those from this branch is much higher,“ said NLN Reddy , placement officer at   , adding that quite often students seeking a career in electronics and communication and electrical and electronics engineering end up seeking jobs in IT firms.
 
 Reason: Better career opportunities in coding in the IT sector. "  and entrepreneurship is also a growing fascination among engineering students these days. Scope for the two fields is higher among students seeking career in information technology and computer science.
