Ahmedabad: Vejalpur police investigating the theft at a jewellery shop worked on different fronts on Monday. Police questioned the workers at a construction site nearby, checked CCTV footage, and also contacted police officials of other states to get information on any gang that uses similar modus operandi.

 On Saturday morning, Nilesh Shah, the owner of Samor Krupa Jewellers at Jivraj Park Society, had reported a break-in and theft of 1.5 kg gold, 7 kg silver, and Rs 2 lakh cash, all worth Rs 49.83 lakh along with CCTV and DVR from the shop. The thieves had cut a hole in the wall at the back of the shop and had cut four locks on the safe with a blow-torch. Police had recovered an LPG and an oxygen cylinder from the spot.
 
 “The safe had reinforced walls which are about 1 inch thick,” said an investigator. “It would not have been possible to open or move it. Thus, the gang members knew what to expect. The hole was spotted by a building contractor on Saturday morning so it is possible that the thieves gained entry early on Friday night and worked for several hours to breach the wall and open the safe.”
 
 Police checked footage from cameras between Jivraj Park and Vejalpur bus stand in search of clues. Officials suspect that the gang had a vehicle to move the cylinders.
