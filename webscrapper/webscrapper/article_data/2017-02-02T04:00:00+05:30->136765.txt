VADODARA: It is a common thing for account holders to pay charges for banking services like demand draft,   (RTGS), cheque books among others. But, Godhra-based Prime   was all set to levy charges for counting currency notes before recalling the decision on Tuesday.

 Prime Cooperative Bank had put up a board on January 25 saying that they will levy Rs 2 per bundle of Rs 10 currency note as counting charges from February 1. Banks are not authorized by the   (RBI) to levy any fee as counting charges. Yet, the board was put up at the entrance of the branch as well as near the cashier’s counter.
 
 Defending the bank’s decision, branch manager   told TOI: “Some of our customers were depositing their money in form of Rs 10 notes and coins so we had to put up that board.” But, he, later, said that they were not planning to implement the decision.
 
 “It was more of a preventive measure so that the customers do not deposit their money in such small denomination notes. We were not going to levy these charges,” he added.
 
 By evening the bank authorities had recalled the decision to levy these charges. “We have recalled the decision, however, we were never going to levy these charges,” claimed Shastri.
