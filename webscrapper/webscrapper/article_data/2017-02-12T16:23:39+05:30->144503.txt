Singer   has learned to 'embrace' her insecurities and come to terms with the unique things that make her who she is. 

  
  
 The 31-year-old singer has said that at a younger age she never wanted to be expressive because she was worried what   might say, but as she has gotten older she's come to terms with the "unique things".
  "Flaws are embraced rather than frowned upon. It's this time of realness. Sometimes it gets too real too. I do think we are living in a more diverse and expressive  ," Ciara said. 
 
 "As I got older, I learned to embrace those unique things. The insecurities don't go away, you know, when you're a young   you're still discovering your body and yourself and the world." "And I didn't used to be as expressive because I worried what people would say. Now I'm like you know what, I am who I am, take it or leave it, but I'm good with me."
