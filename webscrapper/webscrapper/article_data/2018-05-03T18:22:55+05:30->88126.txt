Actor, dancer, choreographer   was recently in Pushkar for a dance workshop. Shantanu, who was the winner of the reality show   (2017), made the best of his brief trip and visited some of the landmark places in this   town. During his Pushkar visit, Shantanu shared with us, “I am in Pushkar for a fitness workshop with Macedon D’Mello, who is also a member of our dance group, Desi Hoppers. It has been a wonderful experience. We got to attend some good fitness sessions where we learnt quite a few new workout regimes and techniques which we plan to soon incorporate in our warm-up sessions before dance rehearsals.”

 Not just taking part in dance workshop, Shantanu also went sightseeing. He adds, “We visited the Brahma mandir and also took some time out to visit the local market in the city from where we bought Rajasthani jootis and ate yummy delicacies. We were served Rajasthani food in a silver thali and it was amazing. We also watched a Kalbelia performance while relishing our food.”
