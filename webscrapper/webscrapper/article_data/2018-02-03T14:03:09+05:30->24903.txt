BHOPAL/JABALPUR: A division bench of MP high court on Friday dismissed a contempt petition filed by a lawyer against the state government for its failure to ensure release of  's film 'Padmaavat' despite the   order. 

 The petitioner O P Yadav had alleged that the state government didn't take steps as directed by the apex court and it was the reason why the film didn't release in MP. This amounts to the contempt of court, he contended.
 
 However, division bench of Justice S K Seth and Justice Subodh Abhyankar dismissed the petition agreeing with additional advocate general R K Verma and government pleader Rohit Jain's contention that the Supreme Court itself has propounded in the case Vitusha Oberai Vs Court of On Motion that any contempt petition relating to Supreme Court can't be heard by a high court.
