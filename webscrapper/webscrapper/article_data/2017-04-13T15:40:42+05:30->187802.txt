THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Due to drought, water from   is being released under the supervision of district administration. The water level in the dam controlled by the irrigation department was 74.45m. If the water is released from both canals, the level could reach dead storage within 12 days. Considering the drinking water needs, the district administration has imposed regulations for the release of water for irrigation purposes.

 At present, water is released to the canals only twice or thrice a month. This has affected many irrigation projects in Kerala and  . Drinking water supply project in Venganoor, Parassala and Kaalippara, which depend on Neyyar, too have been affected.
 
 The quantity of water available in Neyyar was 13 million metre cube. Sources in the irrigation department said that if two canals, each running over 30 km, were opened, the water will be available only for two weeks. “Now, the release of water is being regulated. The water will be released only if district administration allows,” sources said. One of the canals will be opened on Sunday after a gap of two weeks. Around 1 million metre cube water will be released.
 
 The dam will hit dead storage only at 65m. The lowest level reported in Neyyar dam was 62.5m in September 2003. Compared to current level of 74.45m, the water level on April 12, 2003 at Neyyar was 77.3m. 
 
 “In 2003, there was not enough rainfall in June. So, if the monsoon is not favourable, condition of Neyyar dam will worsen,” sources said.
 
 Kerala Water Authority had earlier planned to bring water from Neyyar to Aruvikkara by reviving an old canal, through which water was brought to Aruvikkara before the construction of Peppara dam. However, the proposal was later dropped due to dipping water level at Neyyar.
 
 The canals of Neyyar dam cover 171km across 23 panchayats. It provides irrigation to 11740 hectare.
