GURUGRAM: Forthcoming   in schools and poor awareness among drivers and schools has forced the regional transport authority (RTA) to extend the deadline for the compliance audit on   safety norms to July 1. Earlier, while launching the audit in early March, the   had fixed a deadline of April 1. 

 On Monday, RTA secretary Trilok Chand chaired a meeting with representatives of private Gurgaon schools and told them over 70 vehicles had been challaned in the past few days for not following the   safety norms. He said once the new deadline expires, the administration would take punitive action against violators. 
 
 Administrators carry out checks of school buses while they are ferrying students to or from home or school, to ensure vehicles actually used by schools adhere to all safety norms.
 
 There are 1,610 school buses registered with Gurgaon RTA. They have been prescribed guidelines by the Punjab and Haryana high court under its   (SSV) policy, which makes it a must for each school bus to have CCTV cameras, GPS systems and an attendant, among other things.
 
 Principals of schools, meanwhile, claimed they adhere to all norms under the policy. Peeya Sharma, principal of Ryan International School, Sector 40, said, “We have GPS and CCTV cameras in all our buses, which are always monitored.”
 
 Apart from the buses registered with RTA, officials from traffic police and district administration will also check if private schools are using any buses registered outside to eschew the rules.
 
 In addition, as per safety norms, all cabs and autos being used to ferry schoolchildren have to be painted yellow with a broad streak of dark blue on either side, Chand said. Speed governors in buses are also mandatory.
