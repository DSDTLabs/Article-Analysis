NAVI MUMBAI: If all goes according to plan, by 2021, driving on the   will be a smoother affair, requiring at least 25 minutes less to finish one’s journey. The   may give the work order for a ‘missing link’ around May. The   will be from   through an interchange to Kusgaon at the Pune-end. The estimated cost of the project is almost Rs 4,800 crore.

 “De-congesting the expressway was a top priority of the CM. The work has been sped up,” said MSRDC vicechairman and MD Radheshyam Mopalwar.
 
 The Mumbai-Pune highway capacity augmentation work was planned by a consultant (UIC-Dhruv-NOD) around seven years ago.
 
 Mopalwar told TOI on Monday, “The pre-qualification bid has been finalised with eight bidders each in two packages, and the finance bid will be tendered in February. Green hurdles have almost been cleared.”
 
 The project model will be EPC (engineering, procurement and construction).   will be arranged from financial institutions as debt, the MD said. “We will pledge toll collection, to be reimbursed to us from August 11, 2019.” Toll collection from that date till 2030 will be the equity pay-off for debt.
 
 The current toll will remain. But it will now be collected till April 2045 to recover the new project’s cost.
