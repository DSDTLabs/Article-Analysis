NASHIK: The construction of the first escalator at  , which began in December, has been delayed due to technical reasons and is likely to take a month for the completion of the civil works. 

 “The construction of the escalator has been delayed largely due to technical issues like obtaining clearances and permissions. The work which was to have finished by now will take another 30 days – likely in the middle of May. Efforts are on to ensure things fall in place before monsoon,” said a railway officer.
 
 The construction work of escalator on platform 1 is being taken on a priority basis while the escalator work on platforms 2 and 3 is yet to take shape. 
 
 Elevators are being constructed on all the platforms to give commuters access to the new foot over bridge that was constructed during the   and connects all four platforms at the station. 
 
 The escalator on platform 1 will be constructed at the space allocated behind the   (RPF) office near the two-wheeler parking lot. Similarly, the escalator to be constructed on the adjoining platforms 2 and 3 will take commuters to the foot-over bridge.
 
 Platform 4 already has a ramp and there is no provision for constructing any structure there. 
 
 “We wonder when the construction of the escalator will get over. Compared to the civil works carried out at Bhusawal railway station which started at the same time as it began in Nashik, the works are lagging way behind. Infact the civil works in Bhusawal railway station is already over. Since the electrical team is not taking over, works are getting delayed,” said Rupesh Bhangale, a resident of Bhusawal frequenting Nashik. 
 
 “After this, they will focus on platforms 2 and 3 where construction of only one escalator is on cards. Platforms 2 & 3 witness maximum rush. Trains coming from Mumbai halt at platform 2 and the trains leaving for Mumbai stand on platform 3. The work should have started parallelly at this platform,” Sangeeta Dhamne, a senior citizen said.
