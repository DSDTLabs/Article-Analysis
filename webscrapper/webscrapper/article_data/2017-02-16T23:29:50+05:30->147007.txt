Hyderabad: City-based drug giant Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) on Thursday informed the bourses that it has received an unfavourable ruling in a patent infringement case related to Palonosetron Hydrochloride 0.25mg/5ml, Swiss player Helsinn Healthcare’s nausea prevention drug Aloxi.

 “The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey issued its opinion regarding Helsinn Healthcare’s patent infringement claims against Dr Reddy’s Laboratories proposed palonosetron product, pursuant to a ‘paper’ NDA under Section 505 (b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.” 
 
 DRL informed the bourses that the court found that the company’s proposed palonosetron hydrochloride 0.25 mg/5 ml product “infringes certain claims of US patent nos – 7,947,724, 8,729,094 and 9,066,980” and that the “asserted claims of the ‘094 and ‘980 were not invalid”.
 
 “We are disappointed in the decision and intend to pursue an appeal in due course, a company spokesperson said.
 
 In March 2016, DRL had received USFDA approval for Palonosetron Hydrochloride injection. The approval came after DRL entered into a settlement agreement with Swiss pharma player Helsinn Healthcare SA in October 2015 to resolve patent litigations relating to Aloxi in the US. 
 
 Helsinn Healthcare had then announced that as a result of the settlement, DRL will be permitted to market a generic version of Aloxi in the US from September 30, 2018, or earlier “under certain circumstances“. The company did not disclose any further details about the settlement agreement.
 
 News of the adverse ruling sent the Hyderabad-based company’s shares tumbling to a 52-week low of 2,803.50 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Thursday before recovering to close at 2,926.85 a share.
