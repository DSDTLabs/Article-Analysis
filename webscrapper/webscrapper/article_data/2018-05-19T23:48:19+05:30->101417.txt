Ahmedabad: The   system for undergraduate courses is set to stay this academic session too, according to a member of the committee formed by the state government to explore the possibility of abolishing the semester system.

 The state government had formed the committee, which is headed by Gujarat   vice-chancellor Himanshu Pandya. The committee has so far met just thrice and is yet to reach a consensus on the decision it faces.
 
 Officials said the academic session is about to begin in June but the committee has not yet submitted its report. A officer said that once the report is submitted, officials will meet students, parents and experts to discuss their decision.
 
 Officials said that since the report was not submitted yet, there is a remote possibility that the system would indeed be abolished. A committee member said it had sought a clarification from the University Grants Commission on abolishing the semester system. The officer said that UGC norms mean that if the system is abolished, grants from the UGC will be affected.
 
 The government after abolishing the semester system in class XI and XII had formed a committeee when the students union demanded that the semester system must be abolished. Even during the meeting in GU, several principals had made representation to abolish the semester system in the UG courses.
