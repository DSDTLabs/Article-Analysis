LUCKNOW: Amid the ongoing row over the singing of ‘Vande Mataram’,   chief minister   said on Saturday that an opposition to sing the national song by some people is a “matter of grave concern”.

 Yogi was speaking at the launch of the book ‘A Governor’s Guide: Role and Duties of the Governor under the Constitution of India’ by UP Governor Ram Naik’s legal advisor SS Upadhyay at the   here. The governor was also present.
 
 Yogi’s comment comes after a controversy that sparked recently when a few corporators of   protested the singing of   at the corporation hall.
 
 “I was attending a function recently in Allahabad on the completion of 150 years of the high court of Allahabad where PM   and CJI Kehar were present. The programme took off with the signing of Vande Matram. But, unfortunately, 
  by some in the state. What concerns me is the unnecessary resistance to it,” he said.
 
 The chief minister said Uttar Pradesh was fortunate to have a learned and enlightened governor in Ram Naik, who has the courage to set things right whenever governments in the past have attempted to function arbitrarily.
