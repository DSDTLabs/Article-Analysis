 CAG reports state government admitted higher enrolment in schools than the actual number. The CAG stated, either the household survey was presumptive or the DISE statistics were highly exaggerated.

 The CAG also recommended for effective monitoring of students enrolled, the dropouts and those who complete primary education as stated in the Right to Education Act (RTE).
