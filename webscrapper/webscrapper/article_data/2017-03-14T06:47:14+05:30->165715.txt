 Krishnat Kore, a member of   (MANS), said the recent incidents of violence against women have thrown the state on a back foot. “The culprits in all the incidents from the rape of a Dalit woman in Washim district to illegal abortions should be punished. The state should provide security to its people,” he said. 
 
 Nilesh Bansode, a member of the  , said the recent incidents of murder, rape have damaged the reputation of Maharashtra. “Women are not feeling secure in the state. They are vulnerable to all kind of attacks, from eve-teasing to torture and harassment. A girl in Bondrenagar committed suicide due to harassment. Dalit woman in Washim district was raped and burned,” he said. 
 
 Bansode blamed the poor law and order in the state to the absence of an independent minister for the home department. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis holds the home portfolio.
 
 “The state does not have an independent home minister. Therefore, the number of crime in the state has increased. Even the police are not serious about the investigations in the Krishna Kirawale murder case. We have already demanded detailed investigation from all angles,” he said. 
 
 An organiser of rally, Rajvaibhav Kambale, said they took out the rally to raise their demands in a constitutional manner. “The Constitution has assured dignity and peaceful life. The incidents against women aim to demoralise them. But we should stand for justice for them. The culprits involved in rape, abortion and the Kirawale murder should get punished,” he said.
