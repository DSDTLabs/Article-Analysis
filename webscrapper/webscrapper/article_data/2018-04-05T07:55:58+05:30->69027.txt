Soon, students in Gurgaon   will not be allowed to enter the college premises and will be sent back home if they are riding a two-wheeler without   or   a car without strapping on the seat-belt. The order comes from the  . 
Dr Sushila Sharma, Nodal  , Gurgaon, says, “The department has instructed all colleges to enact this order strictly. We have put up notices and instructed the principals not to let students flouting traffic rules inside the college. Each college will make its own arrangement on how to enforce this order.” Students found tripling on two-wheelers will also be sent back home. Officials are mulling stricter punishment, like suspension and are hopeful that ‘no attendance’ will spur students to follow traffic rules. Colleges will soon be holding awareness drives where traffic police officials will speak to students about the importance of following traffic rules. 
 The decision is a result of the high number of student deaths due to road accidents. In 2017, 24 college students died in road accidents across Haryana and a substantial number of these accidents took place in Gurgaon. They add that while the order is applicable only to government colleges, a number of private institutions have expressed their support as well.
