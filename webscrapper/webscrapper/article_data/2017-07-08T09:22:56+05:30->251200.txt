PUNE: The curtain raiser for the inaugural edition of ‘Prawaas 2017’, an India international bus and car travel show scheduled to be held from July 28 to 30 at Navi Mumbai, was held in Pune on Friday with the theme centred on safe, smart and sustainable  .

 The event, which is being organised by the   Confederation of India (BOCI), aims to bring all the stakeholders from the bus and car operator associations onto a single platform. 
 
 The event is expected to see the participation of more than 3,000 bus operators, in addition to leading exhibitors, business visitors and expert speakers. For the first time ever, both public and private bus operators will come together to explore the possibilities of a deeper collaboration involving public-private partnership models.
 
 “The private bus operators handle over 64 % of passenger traffic.   demand is expected to grow at 15.4 % per year over the next 20 years and India is currently ill equipped to cater to this demand. The programme will try and find   solution to all issues,” Prasanna Patwardhan, president, Bus Operators Confederation of India (BOCI), said.
