 At the time when India hosts over 97,000 children suffering from   and this number is increasing at a rate of three-to five per cent every year, doctors in the city have a new task at hand—counselling parents along with their children.
 
 Type 1 diabetes, an auto-immune disorder, is caused when the insulin-producing cells stop working at a very young age, leading to the patients’ perpetual dependence on insulin medication. This procedure of injecting insulin often becomes traumatising not only for children but also for parents.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Sharing the concerns aired by parents, doctors say that it begins with them struggling to accept that their children have type 1   and later snowballs into fear about their wards being unable to lead an active life owing to the health issue and insulin dependency. It is at this stage, they say, that doctors must intervene and burst myths related to the disease.
 
 But the challenges are serious. “A lot of parents are still unwilling to go for counselling. There are also many who want to shift their children to alternative medicines. That’s not the right course of treatment,” said Dr V Sri Nagesh, a consultant adult and paediatric endocrinologist and diabetologist.
 
 While stressing the need for parents to shrug off archaic notions about the disease, Dr R N  , senior consultant and endocrinologist of Apollo Health City, Jubilee Hills, said how the new medical equipment can help in doing this. “Today home monitoring systems such as glucometers have become the most common method of tracking glucose levels. With these attached to insulin pumps, it has become even easier to administer insulin timely and as required.”
