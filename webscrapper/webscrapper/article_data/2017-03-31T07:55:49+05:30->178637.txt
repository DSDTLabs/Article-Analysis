MEERUT: In a bid to provide last-stop connectivity of   to the residents of Uttar Pradesh living in rural areas, a proposal for plying of private buses on 22 new nationalised and non-nationalised routes has been sent to the state government authorities by the transport department. Once approved, private players will be invited and permits will be given to them.
 
  Authorities say that the proposal was made after the   directed that people in rural areas should be connected to the city.
  
  Giving details, regional transport officer Mamta Sharma said, “The state government authorities had asked us to draft a proposal of routes which connect the city to rural areas. We have proposed as many as 22 routes and sent it across to the state government. We are waiting for their approval after which we will proceed.”
  
  While on most of the routes, Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) buses connect to rural areas but on routes where it is not possible to connect via  , permit for plying of private buses is given.
  
  “Once we have the approval in place, private players will be invited to take charge of the routes and approval for permits given to them on nationalized as well as non-nationalised routes. This move will help in connecting with the people in rural areas where there is no UPSRTC bus facility,” said Sharma.
  
  A survey was done on the 22 new routes before sending the proposal for approval to the state authorities and routes where passengers do not have the last mile connectivity have been preferred for the project.
