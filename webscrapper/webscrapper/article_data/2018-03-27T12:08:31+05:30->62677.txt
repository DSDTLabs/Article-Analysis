NAGPUR: In a big relief to farmers of Nagpur district,   (WCL) has agreed to supply water from its Bhanegaon mine to Mahagenco’s   power plant. The plant at present gets 37 million metre cube (mm3) from Totladoh dam per year. WCL will supply it 10.76 mm3 per year and thus equal quantity of water will be spared for agriculture. The mining company will supply water free of charge.

 During mining operations, groundwater is also dug out. Earlier, it used to be simply drained out.
 
 Energy minister   went in for this arrangement after scanty rains last year created acute shortage of water for farmers receiving water from Totladoh dam. Mahagenco has also signed an agreement with   (NMC) for purchase of 100 million litres per day (MLD) treated sewage water.
 
 “We will lay a pipeline from Khaparkheda to Bhanegaon to transport the mine water. The cost of the project is yet to be worked out. The cost of pipeline from Bhandewadi to Khaparkheda is also being calculated. When these pipelines are ready, Khaparkheda will need very little raw water from Totladoh dam and our share can be provided to farmers,” a Mahagenco official said.
 
 The agreement between WCL and Mahagenco was signed in Mumbai on Sunday at the residence of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Sanjay Kumar, director (personnel) of WCL and  , director (projects) of Mahagenco were the signatories. Bawankule and Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) of WCL, were present on the occasion.
 
 Mahagenco has also signed an agreement with the NMC for buying 50 MLD for Koradi power plant. It is already buying 130 MLD for Koradi’s three new units.
 
 Mahagenco will pay Rs 33 crore to NMC per year for getting 150 MLD (50 for Koradi and 100 for Khaparkheda). Union power ministry has made it compulsory for power plants within 50 km radius of big cities to use treated municipal water. This leaves Mahagenco with no option but to buy water from the NMC.
