MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday rapped the state for its poor investigation into advertisements, including the online ones that offer   services.

 “Your mandate is to give a clean and peaceful society to the citizens,” said a bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice   while hearing a PIL filed by Ali Ahmed Siddiqui, who said sex rackets were being run under the guise of escort services. The bench said the “grievance canvassed by the petitioner is of a very serious nature which touches upon the moral integrity of the country and requires better handling of investigation by responsible officers of the department”. It has summoned the heads of the social services branch, the crime branch and the CID on Monday.
 
 The government’s advocate,  , said that the police has been apprising the court of action taken. But the judges said they are not satisfied with it. Siddiqui’s advocate   said he could demonstrate that the phone lines are working and the websites are active. But Kantharia reiterated that action has been taken and since phone numbers have changed, the police are unable to trace the persons responsible. 
 
 Kantharia said despite blocking websites, the next day new are opened. But the bench pointed out that the administration has to do its job. “You are the responsible authority. What were you doing? You can’t talk as a common man,” said Justice Chellur. —Rosy Sequeira
