Actor   said he had reserved his goofy side for his children and friends, but is now excited to show it to the world through  .

  
  
 'Gringo', also starring  ,   and  , combines dark humour with dramatic intrigue. It is directed by Nash Edgerton. "Before 'Gringo' came along, I'd never really done a dark comedy before. The goofy side of me had always been reserved for my kids and my friends. So for me, 'Gringo' was a great opportunity to express that part of my personality," Oyelowo said in a statement. 
 
 'Gringo' revolves around mild-mannered businessman Harold (Oyelowo) who is assigned the task of delivering the formula of a new weed pill to a lab in Mexico and all the obstacles he faces. Oyelowo brought some of his own ideas into the project. "I challenged Nash to make Harold a Nigerian immigrant," said the actor.
 
 The 'Selma' star added, "My parents are Nigerian and I lived in Nigeria for seven years, so that element gave me something I could really relate to. I wanted to bring something fresh to the role because when you have a character who is deemed a loser, there are temptations to go for fairly low-hanging fruit by having him be nerdy and overweight and wear glasses."
 
 "I felt having Harold be a Nigerian in Mexico was an interesting way to truly make him a fish out of water."
