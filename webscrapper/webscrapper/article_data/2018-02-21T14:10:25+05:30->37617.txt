PATNA: Patna Medical College and Hospital ( ) has lined up several programmes to celebrate its 93rd foundation day on February 24 and 25. 

 Deputy CM Sushil   Modi will be the chief guest of the concluding function on February 25. State health minister Mangal Pandey will release a souvenir-cum-magazine of the college on the occasion.
 
 Altogether 27 medicos will receive gold medals for excellent performance in the postgraduate as well as undergraduate courses, while 14 gold medals would be awarded to postgraduate students. Over 400 alumni from different parts of the country and 80 from outside India have already registered to attend the event.
 
  will pitch for autonomous status to the college. “Considering that PMCH is one of the oldest and the largest referral hospitals in the state, it should be given the honour of an autonomous body,” said association’s convener-cum-treasurer Dr Sachchidanand Kumar.
 
 He said after becoming an autonomous body, it would come directly under the central government and hence the doctors would be paid NPA (non-practising allowance). “Private practice should be stopped in all government medical colleges and hospitals, but adequate facility and financial compensation be provided to the doctors,” Dr Kumar said.
 
 Dr  , secretary of the association, said even though PMCH is the largest referral hospital in the state, it has no trauma centre which another hospital in Patna (NMCH) has. He said PMCH receives nearly 12,000 patients every year.
 
 Association’s president Dr   said the body has been giving Rs2,000 per month since 2004 to help eight undergraduate students from the weaker sections of the society. “As of now, we have Rs29,66,795 in the association’s benevolent fund,” he said.
