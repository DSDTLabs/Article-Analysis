PATNA: The   (ED) will attach the properties of former Jharkhand minister   in connection with the money laundering case against   divisional commissioner and former Patna DM Pradeep Kumar. 

 ED officials at Patna zonal office said Pradeep, a 1991 batch IAS official, is an accused in the Rs130-crore   (NRHM) medicine scam in Jharkhand in 2003-04 when Shahi was the state health minister.
 
 Shahi, who won the 2014 assembly election from   in Jharkhand, is facing cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for allegedly amassing assets to the tune of Rs7.97 crore by abusing his official position between 2005 and 2009. 
 
 “We have strong evidence against Shahi and Pradeep for laundering money amassed through illegal means for acquiring properties in different locations. While properties associated with Pradeep, including one premium flat each at Kolkata and Ranchi, two houses at Udaipur and a plot of land at Bengaluru were attached on Tuesday, we would start attaching properties associated with Shahi in a few days,” an ED official at Patna said.
 
 He said Shahi and Pradeep formed a shell company named M/S Essar Enterprises. “The firm with involvement of their chartered accountant Shyamal Chakravarty was used by Pradeep and Shahi to launder money generated through illegal means,” the official said.
 
 ED had, in March 2015, took possession of four Gurgaon-based immovable properties of Shahi and his close aides. The book value of the properties was around Rs2.5 crore. Pradeep was a Bihar cadre IAS official, but went to Jharkhand after the state’s bifurcation in 2000. He was Patna DM from February 21 to April 4, 1998.
