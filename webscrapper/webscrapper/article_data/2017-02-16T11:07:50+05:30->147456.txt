CANACONA: A meeting held in Chaudi on Wednesday demanded that the government come out with a solution immediately to resolve the   along state and national highways, as around 140 bars will have to be shut down from April 1 in Canacona.

 President of Canacona businessmen association Diago D’Silva said the very basis of imposing the ban on liquor bars is wrong as accidents do not take place only because of the presence of liquor outlets on highways. “Most of the accidents take place because of reckless driving, poor road engineering, and many other factors,” he said. Former MLA   recalled how the state government, in the past, had brought in an ordinance to protect the interest of a 5-star hotel from demolition.
 
 “It is high time, the government thinks of getting an ordinance or by some other way, to protect the interest of thousands of Goans who are running their family business for decades,” he said.   also spoke among others.
