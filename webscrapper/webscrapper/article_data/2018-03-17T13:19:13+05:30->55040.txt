TRICHY: Trade and business development bodies here have requested defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman to establish a defence procurement centre here to serve as a catalyst for MSMEs to play a crucial role in the defence corridor. Citing the vast portion of land available with Ordnance Factory of   (OFT) on the city outskirts near Gundur, trade representatives urged the defence ministry to allocate a portion of land towards setting up a centre of excellence to share defence technologies.

 The trade bodies which submitted the proposal included   (CII) Trichy zone, Trichy District Tiny and   (Tiditssia) and   (BHELSIA). They said that defence procurement centre if established in the city under the defence corridor could encourage the MSMEs to make use of their engineering expertise in fabrication works to contribute to defence indigenisation. “It would be great if Trichy, known for its fabrication work, receives a manufacturing facility from Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). A strategic partnership programme can be subsequently initiated to help MSMEs work closely with defence equipment manufacturers,” N Kanagasabapathy, president Tiditssia, told TOI. 
 
 A S Ananthakrishnan, chairman, CII Trichy zone, after meeting representatives from   (SIDM), said that CII Trichy had already studied the strongholds of Trichy MSMEs here to contribute to defence indigenisation. “CII will be taking efforts to host frequent meets with MSMEs to sustain the enthusiasm,” Ananthakrishnan added.
