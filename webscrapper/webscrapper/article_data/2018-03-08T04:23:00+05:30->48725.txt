Vadodara: City-based Kaizen School on Wednesday witnessed some tense moments when a parent alleged that his kids were being tortured by the authorities for non-payment of fees. 

 The school on Sama-Savli Road, which was amongst the first to voluntarily reduce its fees as per the Gujarat Self Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2017. however refuted the allegations. 
 
 A parent reached the premises along with some media persons alleging that the school was punishing three of his kids for payment of fees in the range of Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000. But the school officials said that the parent himself has not paid any attention to the future of his kids despite several reminders and intimations from class teacher and principal regarding the poor academic performance of his wards. 
 
 “On Wednesday, after abusing our accountant on phone, the parent was insisting that we issue leaving certificate to his wards,” said school owner Ripal Shah. 
 
 “I tried explaining him that issuing leaving certificate at such a crucial juncture when his daughter is in class IX will only add up to the problems faced by the student. But it seemed that the parent was also concerned about creating an issue,” said Shah.
