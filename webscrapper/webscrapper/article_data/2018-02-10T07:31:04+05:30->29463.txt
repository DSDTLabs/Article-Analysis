NAGPUR: Two retired IAS officers,   and  , on Friday joined the   party. They were welcomed by party president   in the presence of state Congress president Ashok Chavan and AICC in-charge of Maharashtra Mohan Prakash.

 Significantly, Gajbhiye, who lives in North Nagpur, could be used to counter ex-minister Nitin Raut, who has of late not been on good terms with the state Congress president, and the Muttemwar-Vikas Thakre faction, which is holding reins in party’s city unit.
 
 Besides their bureaucratic background, Khobragade and Gajbhiye are dalits, and their entry into the party could help the Congress check alienation of the backward classes from the Congress. Dalits and Muslims were once the strongest vote banks that helped the Congress win every election from civic body to the Lok Sabha. 
 
 However, with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) making inroads into the state, the dalit vote has been drifting. Similarly, the Muslims have given up hope in the Congress, and are looking to newer parties like the Owaisi-led AIMIM. No wonder, the two dalit members were given immediate warm welcome by Rahul Gandhi and the party released a picture of him offering them bouquets. In stark contrast, the news of ex-BJP MP Nana Patole’s entry into the Congress was muted, and was released a week after he met Rahul Gandhi.
 
 Khobragade was a high profile, and even controversial, officer during his tenure in the government. After retirement, he had joined Republican Party of India before 2014 elections. Gajbhiye, though, was a rather low-profile officer, who took VRS to take a plunge into politics by joining the BSP. He had contested the state assembly elections in 2014 and got sizeable votes from North Nagpur seat.
 
 Asked why he preferred the Congress, Gajbhiye told TOI from Delhi that the Congress was the only party that could save secular democracy in the country, and he wanted to contribute to the effort.
