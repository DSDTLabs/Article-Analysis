CHANDIGARH: The new government of Punjab must heed the call of over 600,000 people in Punjab, who have joined hands with   to demand justice for the 1984 Sikh massacre, the human rights group said on Thursday.

 A special investigation team (SIT) formed by the Union home ministry in February 2015 to reinvestigate closed cases related to the massacre received a third extension in February. It has now been given time till August 2017 to complete its probe.
 
 The SIT has told the   that it had identified 59 cases for reinvestigation of the 267 closed by the Delhi police after the massacre. Of these, it has closed 38 cases and filed charges in four. The Supreme Court is already hearing a public interest litigation filed by Gurlad Singh Kahlon on the functioning of the SIT.
 
 “It is time the government enacted a law that will make those at the helm of affairs - politicians, police and bureaucrats- accountable for dereliction of duty when they fail to prevent communal violence,” said Harminder Kaur, a senior journalist.
 
  from   India said that, “The SIT has disappointed many who have struggled for justice. It has only filed four chargesheets in over two years, following a non-transparent process. The status report submitted to the Supreme Court does not even mention the reasons for closing the cases it had identified for reinvestigation.”
