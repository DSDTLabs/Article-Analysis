Figure out how your body language seems to others because it shapes who you are, or who you could be in the future.   in her   tells us how   shapes individuals. She says, “Our bodies change our minds, and our minds can change our behaviour, and our behaviour can change our outcomes.” Thus, with the right body language, we can change our lives and destiny.

  Social scientists look at body language as an important cue to study who you are and if you have meaningful experiences. If you are powerful, you will want to stretch out, you take up space, you are basically opening up. And this is true across the animal kingdom. Expressions of power are about expanding. When we are powerless, we close up. Confident people will be open and take chances. They enjoy risks. They are talkative. Adopt power poses if you want to appear assertive.
 
  Avoid low-power poses, like folding up, making yourself almost ‘disappear’. You may think it’s your nature that drives your body language, but it can work both ways. Since positive affirmation builds confidence, a confident pose can change your life, and your outlook towards life.
