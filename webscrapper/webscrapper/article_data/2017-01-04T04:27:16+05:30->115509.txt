This could severely affect bus   with up to 25-minute delays at bus stops and the transport division mounting over Rs 2 crore loss daily, pointed out BEST committee members at the panel meeting on Tuesday.

 “Last year, when we passed the proposal to procure 300 new buses in phases, it was decided that the first   would arrive latest by December 8. But this has not happened,” said Congress member Ravi Raja. “The first lot of   was expected in January, according to the promises made by ruling Shiv Sena-BJP combine, but now we learn they will arrive only after the civic polls.”
 
 BEST general manager Jagdish Patil informed the committee that the manufacturer has been asked to expedite the delivery of 300 buses. “If required, we will impose a penalty for the delay. The first prototype is expected in two weeks and the entire lot of 300 buses by the end of March.” 
 
 A Shiv Sena committee member claimed the ruling Sena-BJP combine had cleared the proposal for new buses in the interest of commuters 10 months ago, but the BEST administration is responsible for any delays.
 
 The new buses will be Euro-IV compliant with automatic transmission for easy maneuvering. They will also have more leg space, mobile charging points and a forced air circulation system.
 
 Also, two of the six electric buses that were to arrive in January, are likely to reach here by March-end, said sources.
