Ajmer: The bandh on Monday proved a costly affair for daily wagers. Tourists and devotees who came to Pushkar and dargah here were harassed when they were asked to get down from roadways buses. There were hundreds of passengers waiting at Ajmer railway station but railways cancelled many trains on Monday.

 People who live on daily wages such as auto rickshaw drivers, city bus drivers, loaders, truck owners, vendors, tea stall owners and others were the worst affected.
 
 The effect was seen in dargah region where tourist number was low and those who came and stayed in Ajmer were trapped here and unable to move out. Those who reached Ajmer bus stand to visit Pushkar were stuck at bus stand and there was no means to take them to Pushkar.
 
 According to Naya Bazaar Market Association a loss of Rs 100 crores was incurred and there was no transport business. Though hospitals, schools and medical shops were kept away from bandh but patients suffered as there was no public transport to reach hospitals.
