CHENNAI: In keeping with the Centre's push for a   amid the currency crunch, some of Tamil Nadu's most famous temples like   in Suchindram, and Bhagavathi Amman Temple in Kanyakumari have decided to go digital. 

 Five temples, including Nagercoil's Nagaraja Temple, Mondaikadu Bhagavathi Amman Temple and   in Velimalai, have partnered HDFC Bank for e-donations, e-hundis and e-offerings. 
 
 Devotees can walk into any of these temples and make offerings by swiping their debit or credit card in the PoS devices HDFC Bank has placed at vantage points. "Marghazi sees between 10,000 and 15,000 pilgrims coming to Suchindram. We have had positive feedback on this initiative," said H Venkatesh of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department at Kanyakumari.
 
 Visitors can also pay via 'M-Visa' platforms.
 
 "Visitors use smartphones to scan the QR code of the temple's hundi and pay with debit or credit card. Visitors can also select charitable initiative of the temple they want to donate to, based on different QR codes we have generated, which are unique to each temple," said R Suresh, zonal head, retail banking, HDFC Bank, Tamil Nadu. 
 
 "Our two digital solutions are easy to use and temple visitors can donate to the temples' current account or hundi," he added.
 
 HDFC Bank, which launched this programme on Friday, plans to extend the service to 40 more temples in the state as it has had several requests coming in from various religious quarters. "We already have an existing relationship with these temples, so they have reached out to us," said Suresh.
 
 Temple staff members were trained for a week on QR and PoS technology and what needs to be done in case of a transaction failure.
