HYDERABAD: There’s very little a team can do when defending a small total except back itself into bowling the opposition out.   failed to do that and in the process handed Sunrisers Hyderabad a one-wicket win in a humdinger where fortunes fluctuated like a yo-yo.

 
 For the second successive match, Sunrisers put the opposition in at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. During the chase, the guile of leggie   (4/24) did not matter in the end as   (32; 25b, 4x1, 6x1) and Billy Stanlake took Sunrisers to 151 for nine. The Sunrisers slid from 62 for one to 94 for four and 137 for eight with leggie Markande upstaging Rashid Khan’s remarkable returns of one for 13 from four overs as Mumbai managed 147 for eight.
 
 Markande had an outstanding game against Chennai Super Kings and he was in the act once again here, giving Mumbai a toehold in the door which they kicked open to expose the fragile SRH middle order. Markande won a review against Wriddhiman Saha for a leg before decision that was turned down by Nigel Llong just as the Sunrisers were threatening to make short work of the opposition with a 62-run first wicket stand off 41 deliveries.
 
 Skipper Kane Williamson feathered a touch to ’keeper Ishan Kishan, another decision reviewed by umpire O Nandan and when Markande ended Dhawan’s mayhem at 45 (28b, 8x4), it was time for the Sunrisers’ middle order to prove their worth. Both   and Shakib Al Hasan succumbed to the guile of Markande, who mixed it up beautifully, but in vain though.
