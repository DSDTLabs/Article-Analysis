CHENNAI: Sidelined   deputy general secretary   said on Monday his aunt   “herself shot“ a video of former   chief minister   while she was undergoing treatment at a Chennai hospital last year . The footage would be submitted to any inquiry panel set up by the government, he said.

 Jayalalithaa was hospitalised on the night of September 22, 2016, reportedly with fever and dehydration. She was in hospital for over 70 days, until her death on December 5.Hours after Dhinakaran's revelations, the state's   government appointed a retired Madras high court judge, Justice A Arumughaswamy (Retd), to investigate Jaya's death.
 
 TTV was responding to queries in the wake of state minister Dindigul C Sreenivasan's statement that he had lied about Jaya's condition and “merely parroted“ what   told him. Dhinakaran, who is waging a legal battle against the EPS-OPS combine to “reclaim“ AIADMK, also referred to CCTV footage available with the hospital management.“But we have footage shot by Chinnamma (Sasikala), after Jayalalithaa insisted she take a video because she had lost a lot of weight,“ Dhinakaran said, adding that Jaya was in night wear and watching TV when the video was shot. Explaining why the footage was not released earlier, he added, “No one saw her in night wear as she always wanted to look dignified.“ Dhinakaran said Sasikala had given him permission to release the video clip “at an appropriate tim“e to the inquiry panel, and was unwilling to use it during the R K Nagar by-poll.“We are ready to submit it to any inquiry panel, CBI or whatever .We are not scared,“ he added.
