 CHINCHWAD: On January 26, the Republic Day, one of the largest national flags will be unfurled at the Bhakti Shakti garden in Nigdi on the Pune-Mumbai national highway stretch.

 The 102ft-long and 80ft-wide   will fly atop a 107-metre flagpole, said the officials.
 
 Earlier, the national flag was to be unfurled at the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. 
 
 However, the venue was changed to Bhakti Shakti garden as it has ample space and the flag will be visible from a greater distance.
 
 “There is a sculpture of Sant   with   at the Bhakti Shakti garden. There are warkaris (devotees) with Tukaram Maharaj, and mavalas are shown carrying the saffron flag with Shivaji Maharaj. Landscaping and other related works are being done around the flagpole. It will be good to see the national flag unfurling on the Republic Day,” said  , a Nigdi resident.
 
 Shubham Landge, a Chinchwad resident, said, “The garden has already become a tourist spot. The unfurling of the national flag will be a nice experience. Many people would come to see the unfurling of the flag on Republic Day,”   said.
