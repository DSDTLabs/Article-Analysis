PUNE: Harshada Mahajan, a resident of Bavdhan, is elated over the extension of the   route up to  

 Like her, thousands of Bavdhan and Chandni Chowk areas will benefit from the decision. They would get direct access to other parts of the city through the eco-friendly mass transport system.
 
 The Metro route’s extension up to Chandni Chowk was proposed after the state government on Tuesday decided to allot biodiversity park ( ) land at Chandni Chowk for the Shivsrushti project. MahaMetro will now add a stretch of about 2-2.5km between   and Chandni Chowk.
 
 The work on the Metro route up to Vanaz is in progress. The MahaMetro has planned a station and a depot at Vanaz.
 
 On Wednesday, a MahaMetro official said a detailed project report (DPR) for the proposed extension would be prepared. It will throw light on the location of additional stations, alignment of the Metro route and other services to be provided on the extended Metro stretch.
 
 A senior MahaMetro official said, “It is certain that the extended stretch will be elevated and at the end it will climb up the hill. We are yet to finalize how many stations will come up on the extended stretch. There can be a station at Bhusari Colony. A decision will be taken on the basis of the possible footfall, the alignment and cost estimates of the proposed extension,” he said.
 
 Commuters stressed a station near Bhusari Colony would benefit many residents of the locality.  , a resident of the area, said the proposed extension would not only be an advantage for the residents but also for those travelling from Mumbai or Satara to Pune via Katraj-Dehu Road bypass.
 
 “Chandni Chowk has become a crucial junction for entering the city. With huge residential development taking place towards Pirangut, it is a wise step to extend the Metro service up to Chandni Chowk,” he said.
