Musician  , who is making his debut as a composer with Arun Vijay’s  , is excited that his song on the plight of farmers —   — has been received very well. “It has got 1M views on my Facebook page, and I am happy that people are able to relate to it,” begins the youngster, who says that he made the video after being inspired by a Hindi music video about a farmer and his little daughter. “I wanted to make something similar that moves people and makes them support our farmers,” he says.

 So, he went to   and spoke to the villagers there to understand what their problems are. “I stayed there for a couple of days, and realised how essential their problems are. I was so overcome with emotion that I wrote and composed the song there during my stay,” says Arun.
 
 He also scripted and directed the music video, which, he says, talks about how corporate greed shouldn’t be allowed to deplete our resources. “The Cauvery delta is one of the richest deltas in the world, but by allowing sand mining and hydrocarbon extraction, and dumping industrial waste, we are ruining the land. It is a huge asset and it needs to be protected by us because it is a non-renewable resource,” opines the youngster.
 
 He concludes, “Through this song, which we released on Pongal, I wanted everyone to be in the shoes of a farmer. I wanted them to think about how to rekindle the hopes of our farmers. And I think people are getting what I intended to say.”
