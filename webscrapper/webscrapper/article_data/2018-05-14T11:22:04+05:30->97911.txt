BATHINDA: Farmer organisation BKU ( ) has asked the Punjab state agricultural development bank (PADB) and other cooperative banks not to harass farmers who are not in a position to repay farm loans. The farm organisations have threatened to lay siege to bank officials if they go to villages for recoveries from those farmers who are unable to repay loans and have announced to hold sit-ins at   branches across the state on May 28.

 General secretary of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan)   said that like money lenders cooperative banks are obtaining blank cheques with signatures from farmers while disbursing farm loans. The bank gets warrants of farmers from courts when the cheques get dishonoured.
 
 “Even though the state government has claimed that small farmers who are unable to repay loans will not be arrested for failing to repay loan or their land will not be auctioned but farmers are still being harassed by banks. We have come across such cases of harassment of farmers in Bathinda, Mansa, Moga and some other districts but we stood by such farmers and made bankers return empty-handed,” Kokri said.
 
 Now, such officers will be gheraoed whenever they visit villages to harass farmers and sit-ins will be staged at banks on May 28, he said, adding that the famers had also decided to start sowing paddy from June 10 instead of state government orders of starting paddy sowing from June 209 as late sown paddy could ensure less yield.
