 Professor   who was enjoying second term as dean of MSU’s faculty was arrested by the anti-corruption sleuths in Jodhpur on Saturday. This is the first instance in which a sitting dean of the Baroda university has been arrested.
  
 The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) of Jodhpur has arrested Choondawat in connection with a teachers’ recruitment scam of Jodhpur-based   (JNVU). Choondawat was invited as a subject expert in the selection committee formed for appointing assistant professors in sociology department at JNVU in 2012.

 Choondawat, aged 62 years, who was due to retire in the second half of this year from MSU, is now facing suspension.
  
 As per civil service rules, any employee who spends 24 hours or more in police custody has to be suspended.
  
 “We have already approached the police department to collect the details of the complaint registered against him. Based on legal opinion and as per government rules, we will initiate further action,” said professor M N Parmar, in-charge vice-chancellor (VC) of MSU.
