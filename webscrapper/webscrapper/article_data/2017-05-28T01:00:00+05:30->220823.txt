She played the song to them and they loved it as much as the film’s footage,” says Taher, adding, “Ali Fazal loved the song and the trailer. He dug out his toys and did something special for us though he didn’t know we’d be recording his response to the song without telling him. Richa Chadha got her cat involved in the video. Daisy Shah and Varun Sharma have also done some fun things for us. We can only thank our friends for their gesture.”
