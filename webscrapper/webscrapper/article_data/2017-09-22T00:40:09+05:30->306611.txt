Panaji: With less than a fortnight for India’s opener against the United States, coach   said the emphasis will now be on maintaining their peak physical fitness and not allowing the confidence level to drop.
 
  India scored a comfortable 3-0 victory over Mauritius in an international   on Thursday. The hosts found the going tough in the opening 45 minutes but swept aside the challenge in the second session after Matos opted for an entirely new-look side.
  
  Matos wasn’t surprised with the result and had prepared for tough resistance from the visitors.
  
  “If you play the first team in the second (half) and second in the first, the result would be the same,” the Portuguese coach said after the win.
  
  “For about an hour, they were physically resistant. They were organised and in good physical condition. But then problems started (in the second half). They were tired and we maintained our rhythm. They were not as fit as us and it was normal for us to win,” said the coach.
  
  This was India’s last friendly before the opener against United States on October 6.
  
  “It’s important to continue with our physical and tactical work. It’s important to stay fit. We have only three substitutions at the   which means seven (outfield) players will have to play full 90 minutes. I believe all of them can do that.
  
  “Now, with 15 days to go for the World Cup, we must be in top condition. No experience is enough but, physically, we are in good condition. The players have been with us for seven months. Now we must stay confident. I am sure the boys will give hundred percent. If that is enough, the future will be good,” said Matos.
