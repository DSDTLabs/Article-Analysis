Rajkot/Ahmedabad: A total of 18 officers of Indian Coast Guard and police forces belonging to various states in the country attended a maritime interdiction of terrorism training from September 11 to 29 at the Indian Coast Guard station,   

 The training was conducted by the Anti Terrorism Assistance, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the USA under the anti-terrorism assistance pact between India and the USA. 
 
 The training covered theory and practical classes on personal safety, room intervention techniques, boarding tactics, frisking and searching techniques. The three-week training also covered training onboard marine platform where participants were taken to a ship for simulated boarding exercises, with many equipment having been brought from the USA. Maritime interdiction aims at disrupting and destroying enemy forces before they cause any harm to friendly forces. 
 
 Inspector General Rakesh Pal, commander, Coast Guard Region (North-West), who attended the concluding ceremony on Friday, said maritime security is a dynamic phenomenon and it holds enormous challenges to the security agencies at sea and land. 
 
 “History bears witness to different dimensions in which the sea can be used. On one hand, the sea seamlessly connects the world, brings in benefits of prosperity through trade and commerce, with its resources always available for humanity, but on the other there are always threats of piracy, armed robbery, drug, human and arms trafficking and terrorism emanating from it,” Pal said
 
 These threats have plagued the human civilization since ages and thus force us to design and develop appropriate strategies to tackle them, he added.
