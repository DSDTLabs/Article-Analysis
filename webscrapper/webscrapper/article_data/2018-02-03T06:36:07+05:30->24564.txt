BENGALURU: “Bahubali or the story of   need not be India’s answer to Hollywood epics like Troy or 300. That is a sensibility that Indians need to have,” said Anand Neelakantan, author of Asura, and Rise of Sivagami. Neelakantan was speaking at the prelude to the fourth edition of Times Litfest presented by ACT Fibernet, which was organized at   in Whitefield on Friday.

 “The western audience relates to Indian stories when they’re written in an Indian manner. The Indian way of storytelling is completely different from that of the West, which uses more darkness in stories. We have colours and more elements,” Neelakantan said, adding, “It is a known fact that Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayan and B R Chopra’s Mahabharat were two of the most popular television shows.”
 
 A game of truth and dare between Krishna Udayasankar, author of Immortal, and Samhita Arni of the Mahabharat for Kids and Missing Queen fame, translated into an engaging dialogue over the purpose of writing, setting contexts and finding inspirations. “One has to take a huge leap of faith when one decides to tell the story of another character. It’s one of the hardest parts about writing,” said Udayasankar. “While setting contexts, it’s very important to understand what different characters try to express to you. How would you narrate an abandoned Sita’s story as that of courage and grit,” Arni asked.
 
 Talking of fashion, films and cookbooks, designer  , his protege Schulen Fernandes and TV host and columnist   discussed at length about translating their fields of interest into books. “The biggest difference between films and books and organizing a show is that we know the latter has to go on at a particular time but a movie or book has its delays,” said Wendell.
