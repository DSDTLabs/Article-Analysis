NAGPUR: First chief minister of Maharashtra   always advocated social democracy and was instrumental in establishing cooperative societies for the betterment of farmers, said  , a senior journalist, on Sunday.

 Delivering a lecture on ‘Yashwantrao Chavan yancha ajcha Maharashtra’ organized to mark his 104th birth anniversary at Baburao Dhanwate Sabhagruha, Rashtrabhasha Sankul, Bhave said the leader was in favour of reservation to women and gave valuable contribution to the society. Chavan was a leader of the common masses in the true sense. Such was his foresight that the bills he proposed in the state assembly in the larger interests of the society became laws. 
 
 The strongman was shifted to Delhi by the Congress leadership and made the defence minister. He played a key role during the war with Pakistan in 1965, Bhave said.
 
 Politics alone was not his forte as Chavan was a littérateur and wrote 27 books. He established   and backed Marathi Sahitya Sammelan. He was closely associated with many poets and Marathi and Hindi writers, Bhave added.
 
  said, “The objective of setting up Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan was to perpetuate his memory by acknowledging his rich, outstanding contribution to society and promote his cherished ideas nurtured in freedom struggle and thereby strengthening socio-economical fibre of India.”
 
 Former minister Satish Chaturvedi, writer VS Jog, Ramesh Borkute, Mohd Salim Sheikh and   were present.
