AHMEDABAD: Over 250 junior doctors of Civil hospital in Asarwa area of the city went on flash strike on late Sunday evening after a woman doctor was allegedly assaulted by the relatives of a patient, who died during treatment.

  Sources said that one Laltaprasad Birju Giri, 64, an auto-rickshaw driver of Nikol area of the city, was brought to the hospital with severe head injuries after an accident near Viratnagar Crossroads. During treatment, Giri succumbed to his injuries. Giri’s relatives lost their cool and got into heated arguments with doctors and then allegedly assaulted a woman physician, Dr Zalak.
 
 Dr Vidur Joshi, a third-year MD student and president of the   at  , said that patients’ relative attacked the lady doctor on duty. “At present, all resident doctors are on strike, which involves emergency and ICU, too,” Joshi said.
 
 The flash strike created severe difficulty for patients as they were not entertained.
 
 The doctors’ strike in Civil hospital occurred at a time when the Dhule incident, where junior doctors went on strike after relatives of patients attacked them, is still fresh.
