Filmmaker  's first Kanglish film, Humble Politician  , has Danish Sait as his popular online alter ego, Nograj. Standup comic   plays his wife. Now, actors   and   have been roped in to play parallel leads in the film. 

 Saad explains, 'As everyone knows from Nograj's videos, he isn't exactly the protagonist. So, Roger, in that sense, plays the parallel lead in the film. There is no preaching in this film; we aren't showing a Gandhi. Instead, this is a satire that touches upon relevant issues today and borders on a few grey areas. Roger's character is pitted against Nograj and is more like the voice of reason. Sruthi plays his wife and her role brings in an interesting feminist perspective in the film and it is a very pivotal part to the entire narrative.'
 
 The entire team, which included key technicians and the entire cast, had a Hollywood-style table read session on Tuesday, in which they got to understand the film and know each other. The team is prepping to start rolling from February 27. The film, which has been co-written by Saad and Danish, is being backed by the makers of Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu.
