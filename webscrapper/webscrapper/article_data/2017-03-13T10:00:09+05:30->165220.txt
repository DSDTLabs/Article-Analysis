BHOPAL: More than Rs 35,000 crore of stashed cash was pulled out of hidden lockers of corporates and individuals and deposited in 25 major banks within 60 days of   in  , reveal documents accessed by TOI.

 More than 40% of these accounts are under I-T surveillance, say sources. Money in Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana Accounts rose by Rs 461 crore after the note ban — from Rs 863 crore on November 8, 2016, to Rs 1,324 crore on January 19, 2017. This debunks the belief that PMJDY accounts were the main source of depositing undisclosed cash.
 
 The document states that 25 major banks in the state had an aggregate deposit of Rs 2, 57,372 crore on November 8, 2016, which shot up to Rs 2, 92,901 crore by January 10, 2017 — a whopping rise of Rs 35,529 crore. The 10 banks that saw the maximum cash deposit were Union Bank of India, Indian Bank, Axis Bank, IDBI, Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, ICICI, HDFC, Syndicate Bank and Bank of India, say sources.
 
 It was this surge in deposits that led the MP government to constitute a special task force under state finance minister Jayant Malaiya to chart out a road map for adoption of digital transactions.
 
 Asked about the large amounts of cash deposited during demonetisation, Malaiya said it was the job of income tax department to verify the sources. “Training is being imparted at the block levels to promote cashless transaction. College students and volunteers have been roped in for this. It takes time to change the habit of using cash. I am also trying to use my debit card more than cash these days, he added. 
 
 Other members of the committee are additional chief secretaries of finance, panchayat and rural development, and economic & statistics departments. Principal secretaries of commercial tax, labour and cooperative departments are also on the panel, apart from the general manger, SBI, and convenor/general manager, State-Level Bankers’ Committee.
 
 The IT department has conducted 87 search operations and questioned 2,400 individuals across Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh after demonetisation despite being short of personnel.
