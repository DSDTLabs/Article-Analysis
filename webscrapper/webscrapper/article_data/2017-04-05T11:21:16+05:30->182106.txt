AHMEDABAD: The present respite from the scorching heat seems to be for the short term only, as the mercury is likely to soar from April 8, with wind patterns changing to northwesterly to northerly from southerly to southwesterly. Meteorologists said that northerly to northwesterly winds will be dry and hotter and will raise temperatures. The present wind pattern is southerly to southwesterly and carries moisture with it. Thus, the temperature does not shoot up.

 Jayant Sarkar, director of   (IMD), Gujarat, said the temperature will rise from April 8 onwards. “Right now, the wind pattern is southerly to southwesterly. These winds are coming over   from the south or south-west and are bringing moisture to the state. They are causing the humid   and lower temperatures. There was a drop in the maximum temperature in the state on Tuesday as well,” Sarkar said.
 
 “The Met department does not expect any kind of heat wave till April 7. From April 8 onwards, the temperature is likely to rise because the wind pattern will change to northwesterly to northerly. These winds are expected as be dry and hot, so from April 8 the temperature will increase and this will last for three to four days at least,” Sarkar added.
