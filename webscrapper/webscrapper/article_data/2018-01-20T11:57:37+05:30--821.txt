THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A special committee appointed by the   ( ) to study the functioning of autonomous colleges in the state has started its first sitting at the council office here at 10am on Saturday.

 The committee would meet the representatives of teacher’s organisations and student outfits, in two separate sessions. Right now, the discussions are going on with the teachers’ representatives.
 
 The committee was formed by the recently revamped council, following complaints that all was not well when it comes to the functioning of a small number of government and aided colleges that got academic autonomy during the former   rule. Several universities have alleged that the autonomous colleges affiliated with them were showing reluctance to follow the rules laid down by the university.
  
 Two representatives each of the organisations can participate in the meeting. The interaction with teachers' organisation representatives would begin at 2 pm on the same day.
 
 Unlike the former UDF government which took a stand in favour of giving academic autonomy to select higher education institute, the   led   government is not in favour of providing autonomy to the institutions. The Left teachers organisations and student unions were in the forefront against the agitations against government giving autonomy to colleges during the UDF rule.
