CHANDIGARH: Good news for all the teachers working under   (SSA) in government schools in Chandigarh. Around 812 junior basic training (JBT) teachers and trained graduate teachers (TGTs) working under SSA will finally get their dearness allowance (DA) for the last one year. Education secretary on Wednesday signed the DA enhancement file.

 Since January 2017, they had been getting their salaries as per the previous pay commission. It was due to lack of budget as the ministry of human resource development (MHRD) did not transfer the installment on time to UT, officials said. The budget of Rs 41 crore was transferred to UT only last week.
 
 In 2017, the DA was increased to 136% in January and to 139% in July. “Since the file has been signed, the teachers will now get their pending enhanced DA at 136% from January, 2017 to June, 2017 and 139 % DA from July, 2017 to December, 2017,” said  , president, SSA, Teachers Welfare Association.
 
 He added, “On December 22, we met the education secretary and requested him to issue DA enhancement letter at 139 %. We had also informed the education secretary that there was no need to take DA issue in the upcoming meeting of executive committee (EC) and SSA society as the matter was already settled in the EC in August 2011.
 
  In the August meeting, it was decided to give DA to SSA teachers as and when the letter is issued by the personnel department. We are thankful to the education secretary and director   for approval of the same.”
