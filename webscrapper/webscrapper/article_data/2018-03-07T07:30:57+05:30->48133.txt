 Having lost his father to heavy drinking,   had promised himself not to fall in the same trap. Yet when he started working as a driver to help his family,   and coaxing by some friends led him to drugs in his early twenties.
 
 From three tablets a day, he reached a stage where he would consume over 100 tablets of synthetic narcotics every day. “For years, I continued taking drugs and driving around. The   and the high that would bring temporary relief from the harsh realities of life, pushed me further. I had a huge debt and breaking the cycle had become almost impossible” he says.
 
 “Soon even my friends started refusing me money. To buy drugs, I would steal money from my house and even that of my relatives,” Mehra adds. “Soon I was also taking smack and heroine”.
 
 “By this time I was married and had a daughter. Every day, I would look at her and wonder what was I doing? One day, I came home and decided enough was enough. I sought help from my two brothers. They got me admitted to a de-addiction centre about four months back and I have made immense progress. I met my daughter a few days back and she asked when I was coming back. I am certain that it will be very soon,” he adds.
 
 
 
 
 The crackdown on drugs raised the price and the scarcity led to rise in the number of users arriving at drug de-addiction centres. State government-sponsored Saket Drug Deaddiction centre, in the home district of CM Amarinder Singh has seen the same trend. It has a capacity of 50 beds and treats many others as outdoor patients. Though latest data is not available, since it started in 1995, the centre has treated over 21,000 users, including 12,000 indoor patients.
