NEW DELHI: The Delhi high   on Friday refused to entertain a plea by an   claiming to represent   eatery owners, seeking a stay on a recent NDMC notice asking them to get mandatory fire clearance from fire department.

 “There is nothing more in the NDMC notice than compliance with law,” a bench of acting chief justice Gita Mittal and justice C Hari Shankar pointed out to the association’s counsel, declining any immediate  .
 
 HC also wondered how an organisation can come on behalf of all shop owners at Khan Market. “These are individual notices. There may be members who are not aggrieved or some who may have complied with the NDMC notice. Facts of each notice to   may be different. You have not annexed all the notices,” the bench noted, saying if any person was affected by the NDMC order, they have the option of filing individual writ petitions.
 
 Before HC, the petitioner association argued that NDMC has claimed its notice is to implement directions given by a bench of Delhi HC in a pending matter. However, there have been no such directions issued, it maintained, and further submitted that as per existing law, it is for the NDMC to obtain fire clearance from the fire department for the eateries, with the owners having no role.
 
 But the bench was not convinced and refused to stay the notice re-iterating that there must be compliance with law.
