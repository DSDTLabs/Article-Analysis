AHEMDABAD: More than 100 companies participated in the placement process for the 2017 postgraduate programme ( ) class at the   (IIM-A), during which 110 students made dream applications. But the e-commerce giant  , which had deferred the joining dates of 18 students last year, did not participate. Sources in the placement committee said that the company had not been barred.

 “The placement process was open to all companies, but Flipkart did not join it this year,” said a source in the IIM-A. Last year, Flipkart had deferred the joining dates for about six months after promising jobs to the 18 students. A controversy erupted after a strongly worded letter from the IIM-A to the company was leaked to the media. 
 
 This year, Amazon made the maximum number of offers: 18 . McKinsey & Company made the highest number of offers in the consulting domain (15). Among global banks, Goldman Sachs was the largest recruiter, having picked nine students. In the sales and marketing domain, HUL extended seven offers followed by Procter & Gamble, SC Johnson, and Samsung with six offers each. With 10 offers, TAS was the largest recruiter in the general management cohort. Sprinklr extended nine offers in the consumer tech cohort. Seven students opted out of the placement process to work on their own ventures, under the guidance of CIIE. This year, IIM-A placements were split in two stages. “As in previous years, students were provided the flexibility of making ‘dream’ applications to firms of their choice in a subsequent cluster even with an offer in hand ,” said a statement from the IIM-A. “There were 110 dream applications this year. This gave students the flexibility and choice to build careers in sectors of their preference.”
