 Arjun, the director of the film, says, “Lakshmi Menon is a professional dancer, and has been learning Bharatanatyam, for several years. That’s why we decided to rope her in, and it was in fact easy for us to shoot with her. She plays a village girl, who belongs to the 1987 era. She has in fact lost some weight to fit into the character. It is just one of the characters that she plays in the film.” 
 
 As for her styling,   says, “We had a couple of references for her look in the film. We approached Rasheed, a stylist who worked on Tamannaah’s look in Devi(L). We wanted Lakshmi to look ethnic, traditional, at the same time, elegant. Rasheed styled her, and made sure that she look fabulous on screen.” 
 
 The film has   playing the role of a   coach. Being a comedy entertainer, the film also has actors like RJ Balaji, Kaali Venkat, Chitra Lakshman, Munishkanth, and Marimuthu. Well-known director,   plays Prabhudheva’s dad in the film, and Amrish scores music for the project.
