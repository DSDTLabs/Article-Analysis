HYDERABAD: Reiterating that the   party has a history of fulfilling promises,   Pradesh Congress Committee president N   Kumar Reddy on Wednesday sought to reassure every farmer that the party will waive off 2 lakh per family crop loan if voted to power in 2019. 

 
 Reacting sharply to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's statement that it would not be possible for the Congress to waive off 2 lakh crop loan, Uttam said: "  has the history of making empty promises. He has failed to fulfil several promises, made to the people during Telangana agitation, in the last four years. He thinks that even Congress, on the same lines, will not be able to write off the loans. I am making it clear that the Congress, after being voted to power, will write off crop loans as promised. There should be no second thought about it," he told a gathering at Sanga Reddy where he participated in a deeksha organised by party's former MLA Jagga Reddy demanding a medical college to be established. 
 
 He stated that the budget outley of Telangana would cross 1.90 lakh crore by the time Congress comes to power.
