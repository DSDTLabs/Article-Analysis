Sinchana, a Class 4 student, had begged her father to leave her in her grandmother’s house. An inebriated Prajwal heard none of her pleas and told Sinchana he would kill her as he was unable to look after her. He slit her throat and shifted her body to a room upstairs, an officer said.

Prajwal went to his in-laws’ house in KHB Colony, and took Sinchana home in the evening.
 
 Prajwal spent the night with the bodies of his wife and daughter. He left home on Thursday morning and returned late in the evening with a pesticide bottle. On Thursday night, he cut his throat and wrist and called his father. Around 1am Friday, his father Ramachandra had rushed to Prajwal’s house and shifted him to  . Cops suspect a financial issue could have triggered fight between the couple. Prajwal had been thrown out of his job a year ago, after he turned alcoholic. He reportedly told police that he suffered from impotency, and suspected his wife’s fidelity. The family had relocated to Mysuru because of this.
 
 Prajwal claimed that Savitha had been demanding money and a share in property. It was Ramachandra, a retired BEML employee, who was taking care of his family.
 
 The couple had purchased their Basavanahalli home for Rs 90 lakh in 2017 and moved to Mysuru after quitting their jobs in Bengaluru.
