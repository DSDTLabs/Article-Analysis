PUNE: Sri Lanka have been one of India's favourite and frequent opponents. But not so for Test match cricket. For, India haven't hosted Sri Lanka since the Mumbai Test in December 2009 though they have played 11 home ODIs against them in this phase and more than 25 ODIs at all venues.

 As many as 27 Test players of Sri Lanka, who made their debuts since 2010, haven't played Test cricket in India. The most notable of them are Suranga Lakmal (36 Tests), Thirimanne Lahiru (26), Kaushal Silva (35), Dinesh Chandimal (36) and Dimuth Karunaratne (38).
 
 India last played a Test series against Pakistan in 2007-08. It was a home series. It means the likes of Saeed Ajmal (35 Tests), Mohammad Amir (25), Sarfraz Ahmed (33), Azhar Ali (57), Wahab Riaz (24), Asad Shafiq (53) and Yasir Shah (23) too haven't played against India.
 
 India's last home series against Zimbabwe was in 2002 and away series way back in 2005. On the other hand, India managed to get   to play at home twice in a row for Sachin Tendulkar's farewell Test in 2013-14.
 
 Though India are atop world Test rankings and hold the rubber against all nine Test-playing countries, the above facts take away some credit from the grand effort. Plus, India have never ever won a Test series in   and  . Even ICC's role in the scheduling that affects the rubber situation and ranking is questionable because the FTP and overall calendar has turned into bit of a joke.
 
 India have played 13 successive Tests at home. The other major Test playing nations don't even come close if we consider the last 50 Tests of these teams - the numbers are Sri Lanka (8), England and New Zealand (7 each), Australia and South Africa (6 each) and West Indies (5). Among India's six regular opponents, India have won their last 'away series' only in West Indies last year, losing to Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa and drawing the one-off Test in Bangladesh in 2015. Despite losing the above four away series, they are No. 1. Of course, they have won their last home series against Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, South Africa and West Indies.
 
 India's total performance against the six opponents in the respective last series both home and away reads: 37 Tests, 18 won, 8 lost and 11 drawn. Win percentage 48.65. If you concentrate on the home series, it reads: 19 Tests, 15 won, 1 lost and 3 drawn. Win percentage is a whopping 78.95. But in away games, it drops to a deplorable 16.67 percent. For, it reads: 18 Tests, won 3, lost 7, drawn 8.
