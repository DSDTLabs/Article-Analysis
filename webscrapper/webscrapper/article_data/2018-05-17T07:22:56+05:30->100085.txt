LUCKNOW: In yet another incident, a nine-year-old girl was attacked by a pack of four dogs in   on Wednesday. The continued menace has exposed chinks in the claims of the district administration and police that the situation was under control.

 
 A resident of   village in Khairabad,   was attacked in a mango orchard. Her three friends were with her. The incident occurred around 5.30pm on Wednesday. The girl was rushed to Sitapur district hospital where her condition was reported to be stable.
 
 City magistrate Harsh   said the girl told him that the four ferocious dogs caught her by the neck. Hearing her cries, some villagers chased the dogs with sticks. Pallavi has bite injuries on her head, neck and shoulders.
 
 Her father   was furious with administrative officials. He said he would migrate after the condition of his daughter improves.
 
 When TOI called Sitapur district magistrate  , she said that despite awareness drives, villagers were letting their children go out unattended.
 
 “We have roped in members of the police and forest departments and from NGOs. They are going to every nook and corner and telling people to not allow their children to go out alone,” said Verma.
 
 She added that forest officials had prepared a route map where teams would be camping permanently to nab the ferocious dogs.
