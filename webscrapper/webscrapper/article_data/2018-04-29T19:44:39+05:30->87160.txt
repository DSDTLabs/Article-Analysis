 Sunrisers Hyderabad win the coin toss, opt to bat first against Rajasthan Royals
 
 
 Both Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad, incidentally, are coming into Sundayâ€™s game after pulling off Houdini Acts in their last matches. While SRH defended what seemed to be an indefensible score against Kings XI Punjab, Royals chased down a target against Mumbai Indians that at one stage had looked impossible. That would be confidence boosters for both sides.
