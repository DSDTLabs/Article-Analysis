AGARTALA: Employees of   giant BSNL have taken to singing the   before work from Monday in an effort to   among different  . 

 According to Asim Bhattacharjee, the chief accounts officer of BSNL's Tripura SSA, the initiative was the brainchild of employees and not a diktat from the authorities.
 
 "Singing the national anthem before work is not mandatory for any employee or officer. We have started gathering at the conference hall at 10am every day from Monday to sing the national anthem. Anyone can join us. We hope the practice will improve work culture and fellowship in office," Bhattacharjee said.
 
 He pointed out that many corporate houses and institutions had adopted a similar practice and often organized assemblies or meditation sessions to motivate employees.
 
 "The BSNL head office here has a staff of around 150, including the general manager, and many of us don't meet each other for long periods. This affects fellow-feeling and work culture. Playing of the national anthem everyday will create better relations among us," he said.
 
 Bhattacharjee added that the practice had already been adopted in two training centres of the BSNL - in Jabalpur and Ghaziabad - almost a decade ago.
