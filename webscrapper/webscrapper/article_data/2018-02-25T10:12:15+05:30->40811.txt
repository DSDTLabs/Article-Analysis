HYDERABAD: The poll bugle has been sounded by   of the Bhartiya Janta Party( ).

 
 In an obvious bid to wrest the   Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 election, he will embark on a 135 km padayatra in Nizamabad parliamentary constituency from March 2. The seat is currently held by Kalvakuntla Kavitha, daughter of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.
 
 Arvind’s 10 day padayatra will culminate in a huge public meeting at Bodhan on March 11.
 
 “The time has come to keep my word and demand the state government to reopen the Nizam sugar factory. I will stand by sugarcane farmers," Arvind said in an announcement on Saturday.
 
 With its strategy worked out to win the Nizamabad parliament seat, BJP has shown interest to field Arvind Dharmapuri from the constituency.
 
 Arvind's father D Srinivas is a   member. Prior to joining the TRS, he was with the Congress. Arvind, however, chose to join the BJP to chalk out his own political course. In the last few months, through his Arvind Foundation he provided funds to save lives of 70 children by taking care of the cost of surgeries needed for their ailments.
 
 
 Arvind has also taken up the issue of Minimum Support Price (MSP) for red jowar farmers, for which they were agitating. He made a representation to Union minister of state for home Hans Raj Gangaram to take up the issue for not only red jowar but turmeric too with the Centre.
 
 
 He is also attacking the TRS government on its 'failures.' "What kind of progressive government chucks its people into abyss roads?? Please don't try to masquerade such acts of negligence as development, which claims the lives of citizens!" Arvind said on Facebook on the condition of roads in Nizamabad.
