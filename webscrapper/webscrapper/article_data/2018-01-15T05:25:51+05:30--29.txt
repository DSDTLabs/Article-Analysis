BENGALURU: It’s not just members of the public who are looking to purchase ISI-mark helments in the city. Leading the lot are city cops, who have been categorically told by additional commissioner of police (traffic) R   that they’d be the first ones to face the heat if they fail to comply with the helmet norms. 

 Cops are busy scouting for new helmets, with several of them even visiting other districts and neighbouring   as demand for specific type of helmets has been much higher than supply in the city.
 
 Many constables, head constables, sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspectors, who use two-wheelers, are purchasing helmets from different districts, including   and  .
 
 “It’s not that there is a shortage in supply of ISI-labelled helmets in the city, but we aren’t getting the type we prefer. We generally choose helmets which cover the chin, but not the mouth as it’s easy to use a walkie talkie or mobile phones,” said a policeman who bought a helmet from Belagavi.
 
 A constable from south-east division said, “Around 40 of our batchmates purchased helmets from   on Friday. The seller sent them in a bus and we collected them near Madiwala. Next week, 50 such helmets will arrive from the same seller.” Hitendra said he is happy that police personnel are ensuring they have helmets with   mark by February 1. “Being law-enforcers, we should set an example for citizens,” he said.
