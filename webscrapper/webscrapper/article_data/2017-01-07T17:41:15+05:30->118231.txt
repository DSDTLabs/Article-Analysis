 said she is a terrible dater. The 'Cheaper by the Dozen' star briefly romanced trainer   last year, going public with her first official relationship since splitting from ex-husband   in October, but it was doomed and by the end of November (16), the couple had called it quits.

  
  
 Hilary, 29, has opened up about her failed love life, insisting finding a new man isn't a top priority for 2017. 
 
 "I've never been a good dater. I meet, like, one person a year that I'm maybe attracted to. I never want to be that girl who's desperate to find a mate." 
 
 Instead, Hilary is focused on raising her four-year-old son Luca with former ice hockey player Mike, who she has remained close to since their split in 2014, after three years of marriage.
