NEW DELHI:   on Wednesday officially launched their much-awaited 
  –  . Pronounced 'tee-gaur', the car gets a starting price of Rs 4.70 lakh and will directly lock horns with the likes of Maruti Suzuki Dzire, Honda’s Amaze,  , Ford Aspire and Volkswagen Ameo.

 Tata Motors is looking to create a major dent in the expanding mid-segment sedan category and pricing it below Dzire – a volume driver for Maruti – is a clear sign that it intends to break traditional market boundaries. Tigor though has a lot working for it apart from its rather attractive pricing.
 
 Based on the Tiago platform, the Tigor stands taller than the hatchback. It is also wider and longer. 
 
 It has been loaded with features like dual-tone front bumpers, smoked projector head lights, 15-inch alloys and LED tail lights (varying with variants). On the inside too, the Tigor gets a host of features which include a five-inch infotainment system, eight-speaker system from Harman, automatic climate control, among others.
 
 Tigor is powered by the same engine seen on the Tiago. So, it gets 1.2-litre petrol engine which churns out 85 Ps of power and 114Nm of torque. The diesel variant gets a 1.05-litre engine with 70Ps of power and 140Nm of torque.
 
 Bookings for the car were thrown open last week for an amount of Rs 4,000. With an uplifted Dzire from Maruti and the all-new Chevrolet Beat Essentia also looming around the corner, the segment is buzzing with automakers vying hard to score over competition and win a place in Indian homes.
 
 Here is a look at how different variants of the Tigor will be priced:
 
 
 
 Tigor XE Rs 4.7 lakh
 Tigor XT Rs 5.41 lakh
 Tigor XZ Rs 5.9 lakh
 Tigor XZ (O)Rs 6.19 lakh
