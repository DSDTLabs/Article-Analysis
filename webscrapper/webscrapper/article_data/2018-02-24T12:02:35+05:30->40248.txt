MOHALI: The announcement to install CAT III-B instrument landing system (ILS) at the airport has raised the hopes for opening the night flying corridor and brought a sigh of relief to many businessmen in   and other parts of Punjab.

 
 The airport runway is under renovation in which the length will be increased enabling wide-body aircraft to land during the day, while installation of CAT III-B ILS will allow landing and takeoff during nights as well.
 
 
 
 
 The runway resurfacing work will enable flights to Europe, the US, Canada, the UK and other countries.
 
 
 Suneel Dutt, CEO,   (CHIAL), said the upgraded runway will be a gift for the region as it will facilitate widebody aircraft and help passengers of five surrounding states. He said for countries beyond 5,000 km, the open sky policies of the government will attract several airlines to operate flights from Chandigarh, which would have not been possible on the existing runway. He said, â€œWide body aircraft are capable of holding large quantity of fuel and such aircraft require longer runway to land and takeoff.
