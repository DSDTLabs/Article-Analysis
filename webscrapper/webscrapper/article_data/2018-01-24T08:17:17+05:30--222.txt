CHANDIGARH:   Vidhan Sabha privilege committee has summoned former deputy chief minister and   president   on February 6 for allegedly making derogatory comments against the speaker Rana K P Singh during the last yearâ€™s budget session.

 The privilege committee has also summoned the   (LIP) MLA from Atam Nagar in Ludhiana, Simarjit Singh Bains, for the alleged breach of privilege and creating ruckus in the assembly. Bains was barred from the assembly for allegedly throwing paper missiles at the speaker.
 
 It was on June 23, 2017 that the Punjab assembly had passed a privilege motion against Sukhbir when he, along with SAD-BJP MLAs, had registered a protest during the ongoing session alleging that the speaker had a biased conduct on June 22. The privilege motion was moved by the parliamentary affairs minister   for allegedly using derogatory language against the Speaker and the motion was unanimously passed by the House in the absence of the opposition.
 
 The speaker had accepted the privilege motion and had then sent it to the privilege committee to take further action. Badal and his party MLAs had carried out a protest on the issue of using force against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA to evict them from the assembly in which turbans of the three AAP MLAs were tossed.
