SECUNDERABAD: In what could come as a huge relief to residents of   area, special teams will fan out in next couple of days to catch stray dogs creating terror and roaming nonchalantly on the streets and narrow alleys. Believe it or not, more than 3,000 strays are on the prowl in the Cantonment, scaring the living daylights out of the residents.

 “We have set up special teams to catch these deadly canines. The teams are well trained and the exercise to trap them will begin in a day or two,” a senior   official told TOI.
 
  
  
 
 The   had to step in following a spurt in dog bite cases in recent times. “We acknowledge the fact that locals are terrified to move around because of the strays attacking them in packs. Also, complaints of dog bites are rising by the day,” an official of SCB health wing told TOI.
 
 All the strays which are caught will be sterilised at the board’s Bolarum dispensary. “Anti-rabies vaccination will also be administered to the dogs. Once the dogs are sterilised, residents need not worry,” a senior official explained.
 
 The strays are mainly found loitering around eateries, roadside food joints, bylanes and narrow alleys. The worsthit areas are Trimulgherry, Bowenpally, Karkhana, Bolarum and Marredpally. “We are too frightened to venture out in the night,” P  , a resident of Bowenpally, said.
 
 The board, which used to seek help of expert catchers, is beset with financial problems this time round and hence formed special teams of its own to catch the rampaging canines. “We used to pay ?1,000 to the catcher after a stray was trapped and an amount of ?1lakh was spent on catching them,” the official said.
 
 Sources said the officials received complaints from all the eight civilian wards. “We cannot say that most of the complaints we received pertain to one particular area. The stray dogs move from one area to another. Our teams will reach out to all the wards and try to put an end to this menace,” he added.
