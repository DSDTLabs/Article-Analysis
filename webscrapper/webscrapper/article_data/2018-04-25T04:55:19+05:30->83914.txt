MUMBAI: A bystander had a narrow escape when assailants shot dead Shiv Sena deputy shakha pramukh Sachin   on Sunday. The 27-year-old, who had stepped out with a neighbour for snacks, was hurt on his foot where a bullet grazed him. 

 Shocked, he said the shooting was the worst thing that had happened in his life. But it did not stop him from giving the police a detailed account of what transpired at  's Gokul Nagar on Sunday evening.
 
 The witness, whom TOI is not identifying for safety, said he would often come to Kandivli (East) from   (East) for a stroll. Around 8pm, he and his neighbour were standing at a panipuri stall at Gokul Nagar. "I received a phone call from my father, who is out of town. I answered the call and started pacing the stretch while chatting with him. I had veered away from the panipuri stall and was standing near another store when there was a deafening sound, like a bomb blast. Everything happened really fast. People started running helter skelter. A bullet had grazed my foot and blood was oozing out. I couldn't get a good look at the faces of the men who had fired the shots," he said. 
 
 In immense pain, he somehow hobbled over to his neighbour at the panipuri stall. At that time, he had no idea it was a bullet injury. His neighbour called up a relative and they took him to hospital by auto.
 
 "I'm having great difficulty moving as I can't use the foot that's injured. Doctors said I will have to stay at home for a month, which means I can't go to work," he said. He works with a private firm in   and stands to lose pay. His parents and siblings have gone to their hometown and neighbours are running around for him.
 
 Investigators probing Sawant's murder haven't made any formal arrests yet but are believed to have leads on the two assailants. An   dispute is believed to be the motive.
