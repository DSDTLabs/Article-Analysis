The Supreme Court’s decision to refer the writ petition seeking quashing of   to a larger bench for review, has brought cheer among LGBTQ community across India. Hyderabad Times spoke to the LGBTQ activists in city to find out what the news means to them. While they unequivocally welcome the decision, a lot more needs to be done, they say. 

 IT’S A PLEASANT SURPRISE BECAUSE WE FEARED OUR PLEA WOULD BE QUASHED
  The true moment of happiness would be when section 377 is repealed. But it’s a pleasant surprise because our sources had informed us that our plea would be rejected. Though our community in Hyderabad has not faced a lot of persecution like in other states such as Kerala, it’s a huge step that will further our cause.

  WE NEED TO WAGE A LONGER BATTLE TO CHANGE PUBLIC MINDSET ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY
  Section 377 is a small part of a bigger problem as there are various other sections in the law that are routinely being exercised to intimidate the LGBTQ community when seeking justice for sexual violence.So,we need to wage a longer battle towards decolonising the way people think about homosexuality and changes need to brought in the society as well as the law.The Hyderabad police has The Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Eunuchs Act,which directly targets the transgenders.Its use is not widespread,but its provisions are very problematic.

  DECRIMINALISATION OF SECTION 377 WILL BE A STEP FORWARD TO TRULY DEMOCRATISE INDIA
  The decision to revisit the judgment on Section 377 is a welcome step.It will remove the stigma attached to homosexuality and will definitely be a step forward towards the democratisation of society.

  IT’S GOOD NEWS, BUT THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO
  This is great news for the LGBTQ community. For the last one-anda-half-years I have been into LGBTQ activism and seen so many people scared of coming out to their families and society fearing legal consequences. We are presently working on a case of a lesbian couple who are facing a lot of issues, but this news comes as a relief; at least, their choices won’t be seen as a crime. But there is a long way to go because the society still doesn’t accept LGBTQ, with or without the law.
