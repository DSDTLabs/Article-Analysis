MAPUSA: Addressing a press conference on Thursday,   (MMC) chairperson Sandip Falari said that no individual or organization has any right to issue directions to the council on any issue. He was referring to comments made by   which stated that until the council incorporates the association’s twelve demands, which are submitted in its letter dated March 7,   shouldn’t proceed with the   contract tendering for 2017-2018.

 “We have got letters submitted by the merchant association on various issues such as pay parking, SOPO contract and convening the meeting of town vending committee, with deadlines, which is not acceptable. It is the right of elected council to decide and nobody has right to tell us what to do,” Falari said.
 
 Falari added that the merchant association can put forward their demands and can engage in a dialogue, but the council has the final word. He said that the council has undertaken a massive drive in the municipal market against stocking of goods on the streets, besides taking action against vendors at the bustand.
 
 The chairperson of the Mapusa Merchant Association, Ashish Shirodkar, said that they had submitted a petition of their demands to the MMC and Falari had assured them that he will take immediate action and the difference would be visible in market, but the council had failed to deliver as no measures were taken to streamline vendors in the market. 
 
 Shirodkar had warned the council that if it fails to take action against those stalls or kiosks which have been erected in the open space, following rehabilitation directions, the association will write to the high court of Bombay in Goa to consider it as a contempt.
