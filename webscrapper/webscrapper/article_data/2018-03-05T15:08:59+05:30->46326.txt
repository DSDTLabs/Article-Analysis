VIJAYAWADA: The Government General Hospital has been failing to serve the poor. The hospital, which has a footfall of around 2,000 patients every day, has been referring a majority of their cases to the Guntur Government Hospital as most of the super speciality   are available there.

 “ We visited the   GGH with a renal problem and doctors there referred us to Guntur saying that they do not have the necessary facilities to serve them. It is a problem for us to travel such a long distance. Officials should focus on adding super speciality services,” says MD Masthan, a patient from Kotturu Tadepalli.
 
 Cath lab facility is unavailable at GGH and patients are referred to private hospitals. “It is a shame that the biggest hospital in the capital city doesn’t even have a cath lab. Poor patients are forced to opt for corporate hospitals, which add to their burden,” said   capital region secretariat member Ch. Babu Rao
 
 The slow pace of works at the super speciality block in the new government hospital compound is worrying patients. Civil works at the super speciality hospital in   that started in June 2016 are yet to be completed. The project, which started with an estimated cost of Rs 150 crore with the Centre contributing Rs 120 crore under Phase III of Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana with a deadline of one year, has failed to meet its target.
 
 “The government should focus on providing medical facilities in hospitals. It promised to start super speciality services at the Vijayawada Government Hospital within a year, but it seems it will take years to complete,” said former legislator Malladi Vishnuvardhan.
 
 The superintendent of Vijayawada GGH Dr Chakradhar said that the works will take at least another three months for completion and extra staff is being recruited to meet the requirements for a 250-bed super speciality hospital.
