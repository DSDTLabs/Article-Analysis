KOCHI: An   of   people who have been deprived of care and protection of their children was held at government tourist guest house at   on Saturday. Fort Kochi sub-collector Imbasekhar heard 44 grievances at the meeting.

 “I have six children and I gave them my land. Now, they want me to move out from the ancestral house. Nobody wants to take care of me. I live with meagre pension fund. I don’t want to move out from this house where I have been living with my husband since my marriage at the age of 18,” said an 88-year-old woman from Kadungalloor.
 
 This is not an isolated case. Another 80-year-old woman from   also shared similar experience. Her younger son and daughter-in-law asked her to move out from the ancestral house where she had been staying since her marriage at the age of 20. 
 
 Many other elders lamented that their children were not giving them proper care after securing land in the names of latter. 
 
 Most of the complaints were related to issues over land property, which parents had gifted to children during happy times. But when parents get older and unable to work, children leave them alone. In some cases, parents preferred to withdraw complaint after children promised to take care of the elderly. 
 
 In a case, the sub-collector decided to issue summons to a daughter of an elderly man after she failed to abide by the earlier order of the tribunal to give maintenance amount to the father. 
 
 Though many complainants are living alone without the support of their children, they refused to go to old-age homes. All of them said that they want to die on the land where they were brought many years ago.
 
 In another case, the sub-collector issued an arrest warrant to a person who allegedly seized land by changing the title deed of the complainant in Aluva.
