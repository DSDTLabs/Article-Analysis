PATNA: Former chief minister   on Sunday said the reservation policy needed review as its fruits could not reach the needy sections of the society even in the last 70 years. 

 The BJP-led NDA ally and Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) chief also advocated for a common schooling system in the country so that the children of weaker sections of society could avail the same educational facilities as being enjoyed by the elite.
 
 Speaking to media after a function at Tajpur High school in Samastipur, Manjhi said the reservation issue was politicized deliberately during the last   assembly elections. Backing the earlier statement of RSS chief   that there was need to review the reservation policy, Manjhi said: “What is wrong in Bhagwat’s demand. If a common schooling system is introduced, there will be no need for reservation in the country.” 
 
 Manjhi also scoffed at the speculation that he might switch sides and jumped on to the RJD bandwagon. “I remain firm wherever I be,” he said.
 
 Sources close to Manjhi said he was planning to meet BJP president Amit Shah later this month to discuss with him the current political situation and his relation with the saffron party’s state unit and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar. 
 
 “If everything goes as per the plan, Manjhi ji will meet Amit Shah at New Delhi either on February 19 or 20,” said HAM(S) spokesperson Danish Rizwan. When asked about the probable topic of discussion, he said, “It will be on our (NDA) loss and gains in the recent past.”
