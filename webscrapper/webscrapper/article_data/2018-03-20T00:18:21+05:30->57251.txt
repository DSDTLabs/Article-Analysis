Tirunelveli: Demanding the permanent closure of a paper mill for allegedly polluting Thamirabarani river by discharging poisonous industrial effluents into it, a petition was submitted to district collector Sandeep Nanduri here on Monday. The petition also sought stringent action against the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), public works department and Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation officials who were allegedly helping the functioning of the mill. The petitioners, led by president of Thamirabarani Paathukaappu Iyakkam (Thamirabarani Protection Movement) J Sampath Chandrabalan and Fr Antony A Cruz said the river is the source of drinking water for lakhs of people in Tirunelveli, Tuticorin and Virudhunagar districts.  They alleged that the paper mill at Papaakudi pumped several lakh litres of water more than the permitted limit. In turn, it discharged poisonous effluents into the river, affecting the water quality badly. Recalling that public and the movement had laid siege to the mill on May 10, 2013 condemning these issues, Sampath said, “TNPCB officials who inspected the mill after the protest found that it was functioning without obtaining proper permission and ordered closure of the unit. But the mill was not closed.” He claimed that the discharge effluents violated all norms that the industry has to adhere to and discharged the untreated or poorly treated effluents into the river in large quantities when more water is discharged from the dam or whenever the river is flooded due to excess rains in the catchment areas.
