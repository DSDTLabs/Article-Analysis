SURAT: Though leaders in the   industry have reacted positively to the Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitely on Wednesday, they were expecting some bold measures like increasing the cap on PAN card rule from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh and the reduction in   of gold from 10 per cent to five per cent.

 Chairman of Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council ( )   says, “Nothing much is in store for the gems and jewellery sector in the Union Budget. However, the MSMEs in the sector will have an edge from the cut in the corporate tax rate for those having revenue less than Rs 50 crore per annum to 25 per cent. The setting up of centres under skill India scheme in key centres across the country will boost the availability of skilled workers in the sector.”
 
 Pandya added, “The long pending demand for reducing import duty on gold, which is currently at 10 per cent, is not considered. This will continue to fuel smuggling of gold in the country, thereby undermining the competitive edge for the gems and jewellery manufacturers compared to their counterparts in other countries.”
 
 Chairman of All India Gems and Jeweller Trade Federation (GJF) Nitin Khandelwal said, "With the implementation of the PAN card limit of Rs 2 lakh, the industry has been facing serious challenges. In order to avoid the challenges, the PAN card limit should have been increased at Rs 5 lakh.”
 
 He added, “Organised sector, which is growing by at least 2 per cent every year since past decade, is directly hit due to this.”
 
 According to Khandelwal, the high import duty on gold bullion at 10 per cent has been adversely affecting the industry. This has built a parallel economy, leading to wide scale gold smuggling. It is also affecting domestic retail and manufacturing industry adversely. Bringing down duty to at least 5 per cent will eliminate the grey market.
