LUCKNOW: If you have been hooked on to your computer or smartphone screen, streaming videos of TED talks wondering when Lucknow would be its host, then the wait is finally over! 

 Lucknow will host its first independent TED event-TEDx-on March 18. 
 
 Christened TEDx IndiraNagar, the event under licence from TED will see a number of speakers from across genres talk about their ideas and the impact they brought. 
 
 Eight speakers are expected to address audience in Lucknow. These include the German founder of Janwaar Castle Ulrike Reinhard, Bigg Boss contestant Nitibha Kaul, fashion designer Ken Ferns and co-founder of Sarthak Foundation Shubendra Pandey. 
 
 Others speakers are founder of Alexis Group Aditya Singh, GST expert and mentor  , founder of Project Impact Saurabh Pratap and co-founder of Venture Catalysts Uttar Pradesh Vinayak Nath. 
 
 "Our city had never been on the map of a TED or a TEDx event. So, a group of 25 of us came together to begin this. It was a long procedure that we followed for securing the licence to hold the independent talk for which we applied around two months ago. We were then shortlisted, went through several rounds of interviews, and only then were allowed to organise the event under the TEDx banner," said curator Ashish  . 
 
 Registrations to the event end on February 28. 
 
 According to Mishra, the speakers were selected from diverse backgrounds based on their ideas and the impact.
 
 TED started out as a non-profit platform in 1984 devoted to ideas worth spreading.
