Chandigarh: At a time when people are struggling to get through to police helpline number ‘100’, the UT police have blamed Mohali counterparts for the problem.

 Senior police officials of UT police, requesting anonymity, claimed that Mohali police do not keep their equipment at their police control room in good condition.
 
 On Tuesday, Surinder Singh, a manager of a Sector 26 restaurant, who was kidnapped on the road dividing Sectors 4 and 9 and robbed and dumped at Kharar, dialed ‘100’ four times but could not get through to the cops, leading to loss of crucial time that could have helped police catch the two car-borne assailants.
 
 Some people from adjoining areas have also complained that they have been able to contact cops on ‘100’ as the number had remained out of bounds for the past few days, but nothing have been done by the authorities in Mohali.
 
 Accepting that problems do exist, Mohali SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal said they have sent a communication to the engineers of BSNL, which manages all the landline services at the police control room, regarding the snags which would be resolved soon.
 
 Pawnesh Kumar, inspector of UT police control room, said BSNL provides services to all the police control rooms in the Tricity. “Mostly people living in border areas of Tricity face this problem. People generally call from their mobile phones at   and get connected to a control room wherever the mobile signals are stronger.” “In case, UT police control room receives any call from neighboring cities, we transfer their calls to the respective control room,” Kumar added.
