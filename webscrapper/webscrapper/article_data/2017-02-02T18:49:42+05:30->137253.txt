Heartthrob Harshvardhan Deo, who played the role of a small town boy in ' ', did something that is enough to make the girls swoon! Shedding his boy-next-door image, the young lad has gone and done a complete turnaround for a photo-shoot. He bared it all... well almost, as he covered his modesty with a bed-sheet in the smoking hot picture. 
On being asked about going bold for a photo-shoot, he said, "As an actor, I want to explore myself. I wanted to show another side of Harsh to the world, which is daring and bold."
 The dashing actor is open to doing all kinds of films, including steamy scenes on-screen. "Why not? I don't want to limit myself. I am a greedy actor and want to do a variety of roles," quips Harsh.
 Well, this guy surely knows how to raise the temperature!
