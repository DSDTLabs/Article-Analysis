MUMBAI: The 11th edition of the Indian Premier League has simply been inscrutable for   pace spearhead  . While on two occasions he faltered badly to give the opposition a win out of nowhere, on Wednesday night at the Wankhede Stadium, Bumrah helped Mumbai Indians snatch a win against  , who were cruising towards a win.

 
 Punjab needed 42 runs to get off the last four overs. Inform KL Rahul was batting on a sublime 51-ball 76 and keeping him company was Aaron Finch (46).
 
 Skipper Rohit Sharma tossed the ball to Bumrah in the 17th over and expected him to give as few runs as possible. Bumrah gave just 4 runs, but more importantly, got rid of Finch and Marcus Stoinis in that over. When he stepped up to bowl the 19th over, Punjab required 23 runs. Bumrah gave away just six runs.
 
 “I am very clear about what I need to do. If there is clarity about your plans, more often than not you will be able to execute your plans,” Bumrah said. Bumrah is touted as one of the best death bowlers going around in world cricket. But Mumbai Indians lost a couple of matches, which they should have won handsomely because Bumrah leaked plenty of runs in the last couple of overs.
 
 In Mumbai Indians’ opening match against Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede, Bumrah gave away 29 (9 runs in the 17th over and 20 in the 19th over) runs in his last two overs to give Chennai a dramatic win. In Mumbai’s match against Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur, the hosts needed 44 runs off the last four overs. Bumrah stepped up to bowl the 17th over and gave away just one run and picked up the wickets of Sanju Samson and Jos Buttler. But when 28 runs were required off the last two overs and Bumrah was given the ball to bowl the 19th over, he gave away 18 runs, which saw Rajasthan chasing the required 10 runs off the last over to win by three wickets.
 
 But Bumrah insists he sticks to his plans irrespective of the situation.
