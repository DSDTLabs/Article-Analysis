Even as Suriya's latest film 'Gang' is running successfully across theatres in the country, buzz has already begun intensifying for his upcoming film with director Selvaraghavan. The film, which is being touted as #Suriya36 (the actor's 36th film), has started rolling from Monday much to the cheer of the 'Singam' star. Producer SR Prabhu, who's bankrolling the project under Dream Warrior Pictures banner, made the announcement on social media, with the post, "  !!       (sic)."  The post was a clear give away that the makers are preparing for a Diwali 2018 release. "Yes..The journey begins   (sic)," director Selvaraghavan responded.   There has been an unprecedented buzz surrounding Suriya 36, primarily because this is Suriya's first collaboration with the ace director. Interestingly, Selvaraghavan had earlier revealed that he was making the film as a fan of Suriya, and that he taken nearly six months to write the script, the longest he has taken in his career. The untitled project, which marks the return of music director Yuvan Shankar Raja for a Selvaraghavan film after an alleged fall-out, also features Rakul Preet and Sai Pallavi as the female leads.
