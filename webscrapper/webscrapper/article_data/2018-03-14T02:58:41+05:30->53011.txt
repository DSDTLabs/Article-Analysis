GURUGRAM:   (HRera) on Tuesday announced that there should not be any difference in the amenities and facilities shown indevelopers’ advertisements and what they deliver on ground.   of real estate projects may land the developer concerned in trouble. 

 Homebuyers have been complaining about differences between what they were promised in realtors’ advertisements and what was delivered. Realtors have been giving fancy advertisements to lure buyers, but are found to be delivering what was not promised. “Developers who give false information and misleading ads to lure buyers will face action,” said chairman of HRera (Gurugram) K K  , while he was speaking at a workshop organised by the authority and labour department on Tuesday.
 
 Khandelwal said the authority has already issued notices to 3-4 developers. “Unlike in the past, now the developer cannot accept pre-booking,” said Khandelwal, adding that the objective is to ensure that developers should give correct information so buyers can take an informed decision without getting misguided. He said advertisements about the project can be given only after registration of project with HRera.
