Often, profound ideas become easier to grasp when expressed with a dollop of humour. Director Hansal Mehta’s ‘Simran’ is a case in point. The film revolves around   ( ), a girl in the pursuit of happiness. 

  Despite several roadblocks — her family, their conservatism and expectations, love, crime and redemption — she doesn’t give up on hope or her journey. 
 
  The film salutes her undaunted spirit and never-say-die attitude as she tries to achieve her goals. Hansal says, “I have always narrated serious stories, but ‘Simran’s tale had to be told in a lighter vein. I could make that happen because I had an actor of Kangana’s calibre on my side.”
 
  ‘Simran’, produced by  , Shailesh R Singh and Amit Agarwal, releases today.
