KOCHI: An extension of canvas onto the cinema screen,   (2014) - the debut feature by artist Babu Eshwar Prasad - which was initially denied a censor certificate after being deemed 'too confusing', saw a sizeable crowd during its screening at the   on Thursday at the Cabral Yard Pavillion. 

 With its sparse dialogue, existential concerns and fragmented non-linear narrative, the Kannada film is intended as a homage to the 'road movie' genre with "the road itself the protagonist". 
 
 "Just as the seed travels in the wind, my movie is about a journey. I have always had this fascination with journeys. I have also been most attracted to road movies. The road movie is the ultimate 'vehicle' for a character on a journey of reflection and change," Prasad said.
 
 While it reflects the works of filmmakers   and  , the film is at its core a dialogue with the iconic film Alice in the Cities (1977) by German auteur  , one of the first road movies Prasad saw. "I can never forget the impression it made on me," said Prasad, who was first exposed to world cinema as a printmaking student at MSU-Baroda.
 
 "The desire to make a film has been a longstanding one. As an artist devouring good cinema, I wanted to pursue filmmaking as an art form. All those years of watching have helped crystallise my ideas on the stories I want to tell and the way I want to tell them," said the Bengaluru-based artist, who had been shooting footage during car journeys along the featured road since 2006.
 
 Seen through the eyes of a civil engineer, the 96-minute wholly self-financed movie is about his encounters during a road-widening project in an unnamed village and along the way. "Many characters in the movie are inspired by real life people whom I have met or have known. In that way, this is a very personal, even autobiographical, endeavour," Prasad said.
