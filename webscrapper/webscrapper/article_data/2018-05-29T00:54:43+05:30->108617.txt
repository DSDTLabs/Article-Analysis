NEW DELHI: Indraprastha Gas Ltd ( ) raised   (compressed natural gas)   by nearly 4% on Monday to offset the impact of   and higher input costs in a move that is bound to prompt public transport operators to demand higher fares.

 The sole supplier of natural gas as automotive and kitchen fuel in the NCR, however, left the price of PNG (piped natural gas) unchanged.
 
 From Tuesday, CNG price will rise by Rs 1.36 per kg to Rs 41.97 in Delhi. In Noida, Greater Noida and  , the price will rise by Rs 1.55 per kg to Rs 48.60 per kg due to higher taxes levied by the UP government.
 
 IGL said the increase will have “a marginal impact” on the per-km running cost of vehicles. For autos, the increase will be 4 paise per km, for taxis it will be 7 paise per km and in case of buses, the increase will be nearly 40 paise per km — which is negligible in terms of per-passenger fare.
 
 Even after the latest revision, CNG will still offer more than 60% saving against petrol at the current prices. When compared to diesel, CNG will be nearly 40% cheaper.
 
 This is the second increase in CNG price since April 1 in Delhi when IGL had increased price by 90 paise per kg after the Centre raised price of gas from domestic fields by 6% for the April-September period in line with the new pricing formula. 
 
 Since that revision, the rupee depreciated sharply, although it regained some ground in the last two trading days. This raised IGL’s gas purchase cost since prices are denominated in dollar. Besides, the share of costlier gas from PMT (Panna-Mukta and Tapti) fields in IGL’s basket has gone up as a result of the revised allocation of gas from domestic fields for CNG service. The share of PMT gas, which is 66% costlier than supplies from fields of state-run   etc, has gone up to about 28% from 19-21% in IGL’s gas shopping list. 
 
 IGL will continue to offer a discount of Rs 1.50 per kg in the selling price of CNG for filling between 12.30 am and 5.30 am at select outlets.
