PUNE: The   ( ) and   will hold waterbird census in and around wetlands and important   and biodiversity areas (IBA) from January 6 to 21.

 A statement issued by the BNHS said waterbirds are key indicators to understand the health of wetlands. 
 
 They also highlight the importance of these wetlands for both humans and birds. 
 
 Asian Waterbird Census (AWC), a pan-India initiative, is a citizen science programme supporting management and conservation of waterbirds and wetlands. It is a part of the global initiative International Waterbird Census.
 
 The AWC encourages people to   waterbirds in wetlands around them and collect information to promote the management of internationally important sites such as Ramsar. People can participate in the census anytime in January, apart from the mentioned dates, and counts from any day in January will be welcomed.
 
 P Sathiyaselvam, a scientist working with Mumbai-based BNHS, said in the statement, “The AWC, primarily carried out by amateur and professional ornithologists, government and non-governmental agencies, has been successful in providing substantial information on status of wetlands and distribution of waterbirds. The data obtained will be valuable not only in order to conserve waterbirds habitats at the national level but also in the wetlands under the Central Asian Flyway at international level.”
