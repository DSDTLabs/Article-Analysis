 “I have been staying in Pondicherry over the last few months working on a documentary concerning women empowerment. There is also a cultural exchange programme on cinema, because of which the French participants are getting to learn a little bit of English from me and I am learning a little bit of French from them. In the midst of all this, news of my film being screened at so many cities together is of course more reason for celebration,” says Suman, who plans to attend at least two of the screenings — one in Kozhikode and the one in Pondicherry.
