PATNA: Japan’s Nara prefecture and Bihar’s   may soon ink a ‘sister state twinning agreement’.

  CM  , currently on a four-day visit to the island nation in the Pacific Ocean, made a proposal to the effect on Wednesday with a view to strengthening the bilateral ties between the two famous places of Buddhist importance.
 
 Nara has more Unesco World Heritage listings than any other 46 prefectures in Japan. Like Bihar, it has a large number of Buddhist temples and sites.
 
 Nara prefecture governor Shogo Arai hailed Nitish’s proposal and agreed to follow it up. “The Indian embassy in Japan will provide necessary support to see that the agreement takes shape,” said a statement issued from the office of Bihar CM on Wednesday.
 
 The Nara governor praised the visionary leadership of Nitish has given to Bihar and the progress the state has witnessed with him at the helm.
 
 Nitish, accompanied by state chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh, India’s ambassador to Japan Sujan   and others, also visited Nara’s famous Todai-ji temple. The Nara governor later hosted a traditional lunch in the honour of Nitish.
 
 Earlier in the day, Nitish met representatives of Ecocycle Corporation, a Japanese company working on environmental issues, and discussed ways and means to bring the corporation’s technology to Bihar to tackle the problem of contaminated water.
 
 Prior to that, Nitish met representatives of Innovation Thru Energy Company Limited and was briefed about the utility of ice battery’s cold ice chain technology for preserving food, vegetables, fruits and vaccines.
