MUMBAI: The festival of Mahashivratri that commemorates the marriage of Lord Shiva with Parvati will be celebrated on Tuesday. Temples are preparing to welcome throngs of devotees through the intervening night of Tuesday-Wednesday. 

 Shivbhakts from all parts of the city travel to Babulnath mandir near Chowpatty at least once a year on this day. Large rangolis and strings of floral garlands welcome worshippers, who bring milk for abhishek, apart from offerings of flowers, bel fruit, belpatra and datura.
 
 In Kopri, Thane, the Mahadev mandir that was set up by the Sindhi community hosts at least 10,000 devotees. Trustee Suresh Ochani said, “Our morning   takes place at 4am and through the day people of all communities arrive to pray and perform abhishek. This shrine was built by Sindhi refugees who migrated to India during Partition. The temple trust was registered in 1952.”
 
 Mahashivratri is special to music and dance professionals given that Lord Shiva as Natraj is the patron deity of dance. The second oldest Bharatanatyam training centre in the city, Kalasadan in Sion, will invoke the blessings of Natraj at the onset of the festival at night. 
 
 “Since inception in 1954, our teachers and students have been worshipping Lord Shiva with puja and offerings of dance at Mahashivratri,” said principal Sharada Ganesan.
 
 Sangeetanjali, a cultural organisation helmed by Acharya Anupam Rai, will trace the journey of music and dance from the Vedic era at Rangsharda auditorium, Bandra. The first part will be dedicated to Lord Shiva and the second half to Mughal culture. Anurita and Anuratn Rai will display their dancing and vocal skills while Kathak exponent Shriya Popat will sketch the name of Lord Shiva in sawdust by her intricate footwork.
