Guntur: Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu’s meeting with Guntur East YSRC legislator   is grabbing the attention of political observers. Naidu, who went to Guntur to inaugurate Omega Cancer Centre on Saturday, interacted with Mustafa in his caravan arranged at the helipad in Guntur.

 Narasaraopet MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao accompanied Mustafa in the meeting with the CM. He interacted with the CM for more than ten minutes. Mustafa’s meeting with Naidu created a buzz in political circles and rumours on his joining the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) soon took roots.
 
 Mustafa, who was a close aide of Rayapati Sambasiva Rao, was in the news for a while as he was in touch with TDP leaders. Rayapati Sambasiva Rao had been inviting him to join the party for a long time now.
 
 Mustafa, who joined the YSR Congress after bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, has contested from Guntur East constituency and defeated TDP candidate Giridhar Rao.
 
 Around 20 YSRC legislators have already joined the TDP and a few of them have become cabinet ministers. In the meantime, YSRC leaders have expressed anguish over the CM’s meeting with Mustafa. YSRC, which has been demanding disqualification of its legislators who joined the TDP, is now gearing up to make its demand louder.
 
 Meanwhile, Mustafa has said that he met the CM to request him to grant funds for pending development projects in his assembly constituency. “My meeting with the CM is simply official and there are no hidden secrets. I have requested the CM to allocate funds for development works, which are pending for years in Guntur town and the CM responded positively. I will not join the TDP and I strongly condemn the rumours,” Mustafa said.
 
 Meanwhile, the YSRC has taken Mustaf’s meeting with the CM extremely seriously and a few senior leaders of the party are preparing a report to submit it to party chief Jagan Mohan Reddy.
