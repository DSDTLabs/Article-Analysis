KANNUR: With the heavy rain continuing in the state, making life miserable, two people lost their lives in rain-related incidents in Kannur district. Several low-lying areas are submerged under water. 

 In one incident, a 53-year-old man, identified as Muhammed Kunhi, resident of   under Kannapuram police limits in the district, died after a coconut palm fell on him. Police said he was working as assistant in a sugarcane juice shop, and the coconut tree fell on its makeshift shed around 8 pm. Though he was immediately rushed to the hospital, his life could not be saved, said police.
 
 In another incident, a 20-year-old youth, identified as Christuraj, died when a boulder fell on him when he was removing water from a quarry at   under Kolavallur police limits on Sunday afternoon.
 
  
  
 Rainfall won't be as widespread as Sunday's but likely to be intense on Monday in pockets. Alert level 2 may be maintained if needed.
 
 Cloud accumulation along the hilly regions are evident. Dense clouds cover northern Kerala, Kannur and Kasargod. 
 
 In the incessant rains in the last few days, the roads have been damaged in many places and also the traffic was affected on the   near Valappattanam when an uprooted tree fell on the road. However, the tree was later removed and traffic resumed.
 
 Since it has been raining heavily for the last couple of days, there is fear of landslide in the hilly terrains, though no untoward incidents have been reported so far.
 
 In the low lying areas of the district, including Thalassery and Iritty, water logging has affected normal life and water has entered many houses as well. Officials said the loss is being estimated.
