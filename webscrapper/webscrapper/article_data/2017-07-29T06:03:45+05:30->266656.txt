CHENNAI: Nation’s longest serving woman prisoner and life convict in the   assassination case —   — has approached Madras high court seeking six months 'ordinary leave' to make arrangements for her London-based daughter Arithra’s marriage.

 Nalini, right now lodged at Special Prison for women in Vellore for over 26 years, said, “As a life convict I am entitled to be granted ordinary leave for one month once in two years. So far I have not availed myself of any such leave. Since I have to make certain arrangements for the marriage of my daughter, Harithra, who is currently living with her grandparents in London, I made a representation to the chief minister seeking six months parole on November 12, 2016.”
 
 “Since I did not receive any response from the chief minister's office, I made representation to the inspector-general of prisons on January 23. As the prison authorities also failed to respond to my request or grant me leave, I have been compelled to approach the high court seeking relief,” she added.
 
 The petition, which has been filed in the high court registry, is likely to be taken up for hearing on Monday.
 
 In February 2016, Nalini was granted 12-hour parole by the prison authorities to attend the funeral ceremony of her father   who passed away in Chennai. Another request made by Nalini to release her under a scheme for premature release introduced by the state government for life convicts who have served more than 20 years in prison is still pending for consideration with the government.
