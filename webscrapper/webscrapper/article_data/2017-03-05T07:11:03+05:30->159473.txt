MIRZAPUR: Elections are not just about caste equations, religion, development issues, campaigning and mud-slinging to achieve voter support, Divine intervention is sought too.

 A number of purohits (priests) in Vindhyachal, the mother of all ‘shaktipeeths’ (power shrine) are working overtime to evoke, augment and amplify the deity’s energy in favour of their political ‘jajmaans’ (devoted clients).
 
 Though the priests never divulge the details, special anushthaans (ceremonies) are under way for PM  , home minister Rajnath Singh, CM   and Congress leader   among others.
 
 “They may be politicians or powerful leaders but anyone who visits the temple is a devotee and like any ordinary person, members of political parties can get various pujas done to secure a successful future,” said Rajan Pathak, president of Sri Vindhyavasini Panda Samaj that has over 1,400 registered members.
 
 “Elections are a big occasion for the priests. Indira Gandhi was a regular visitor to the temple while Rahul is a recent entrant and Rajnath Singh’s association with the temple is famous,” he said. Vindhyachal is believed to be the hub of divine energies.
 
 It is said that powers of Lakshmi (as Maa Vindhyavasini), the epitome of material wealth, Saraswati (as Ashtabhuja) who embodies intelligence, and Kali, the face of valour and strength, all merge in Vindhyanchal to form a power triangle.
 
 “A puja in this place is a guarantee for sure and immediate returns,” said Shakti Upadhyaya whose ancestors performed a ‘vijay anushthaan’ for socialist leader Raj Narain in 1977. “Raj Narain had pledged to defeat Indira Gandhi.
 
 He came to the temple to perform a yagya and rest is history,” Shakti stated.
