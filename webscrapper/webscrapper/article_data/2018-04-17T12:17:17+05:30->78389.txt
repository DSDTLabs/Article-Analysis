THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: At a time when the ministers and MLAs themselves prefer private hospitals, Shashi  ,  , begs to differ. The Congress leader, who was admitted to the   here for day following fever and sore throat, took to Twitter to laud the service at the hospital.

 Must say to those who sneer at Government hospitals that it was a privilege to be in TrivandrumMedicalCollege. Outstanding doctors & nurses, terrific state-of-the-art equipment&facilities (sic), he had tweeted on Saturday.
 
 Apologising for cancelling on scheduled events, Tharoor had tweeted that “health set back overnight and the superb doctors at Trivandrum medical college insisted in checking me in so they could check me out. I am fine and discharged now.’’
 
 Medical college superintendent Dr M S   said the MP’s words were definitely a morale booster for the staff members of the hospital. “The hospital is always in the news for all the wrong reasons. Many, including the chief minister, have undergone treatment and they all are aware of the good facilities here. But not everyone speaks about it,’’ he pointed out.
 
 According to Dr Santosh Kumar S S, deputy superintendent of the hospital, the institution has been functioning sincerely despite being short of hands. “We don't have choices. We are bound to cater to any number people. Rarely someone appreciates us,’’ he said on Facebook.
 
 Dr Joby John, administrative medical superintendent, too said it was great when leaders and people’s representatives set example like this. “We are used to criticism only. This (Tharoor’s remarks) is a major boost for the efforts we are taking to provide better healthcare,” he said.
