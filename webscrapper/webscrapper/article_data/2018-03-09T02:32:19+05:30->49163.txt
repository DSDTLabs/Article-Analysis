NEW DELHI: Allegations of corruption have been levelled against the   in charge of a centre of DU’s   though the teacher herself has denied the charges. 

 An anonymous pamphlet, distributed in the campus, has alleged that Usha Tandon, the in-charge of Campus Law Centre, had misused around   from the student’s funds for renovating her office thrice in 14 months.
 
 The faculty’s finance documents, accessed by TOI, corroborates the claim. The documents showed allocation of funds for false ceilings, floor work and other renovation works in the in-charge’s office. 
 
 However, both Tandon and the engineering department said no renovation was carried out in her office.
 
 Presenting expenditure data for March 24, 2015; July 27, 2015 and May 25, 2016, the pamphlet claimed that Rs 7 lakh had been used to renovate the office’s false ceiling, wooden flooring and wall panelling. “Why such work was done thrice in such a short span,” it asked.
 
 However, Tandon told TOI, “No renovation work has been done under my watch. I came here in 2016 and the last time renovation was done in 2011. If one looks at my office, they can see that it is the same as before.”
 
 Her claims were backed by an official of the DU engineering department, who said “no work was done in her office by the department”.
 
 However, both failed to explain why the finance documents had mentioned the allocation of funds for the renovation of her office.
