KANYAKUMARI: Chief minister   on Wednesday distributed 35.4 crore, at 20 lakh each, to the families of 177 missing   since Cyclone Ockhi hit the Kanyakumari coast last year. The beneficiaries included families of 139 fishermen from Kanyakumari, 19 from Cuddalore, 15 from  , three from   and one from Pudukottai distrcits. 

 For many families, however, much of the relief will go towards repaying pending loans. Jeena, 29, whose husband Sajeev never returned from the sea following the cyclone, of Thoothoor in Kanyakumari will be left with only 6 lakh after repaying a pending house loan of 14 lakh. She also has to look after her two daughters, aged four and two. "We (she and Sajeev) wanted to give good education to our daughters. I am planning to keep the remaining 6 lakh as fixed deposit and use the interest to educate them," Jeena said. Worse is the plight of women who have to repay debts to unorganised moneylenders, who charge significantly more interests than banks. 
 
 However the cheques could not be given away to all the 177 families. Vallavilai hamlet lost 32 fishermen to Ockhi, out of whom families of five fishermen could not go to Chennai on Wednesday. Nisha, 27, the widow of Ousep could not make go as she has a three-month-old girl baby who was born December 25, after her husband went missing at sea.
