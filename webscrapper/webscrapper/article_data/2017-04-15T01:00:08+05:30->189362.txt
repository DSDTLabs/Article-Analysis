NEW DELHI: A 19-year-old boy was allegedly killed by his friend following an argument over a drink in outer Delhi’s Mundka on Thursday night. Police said that the friend was apprehended on Friday while he was trying to flee from the capital.

 The incident took place at 10pm when the accused had gone to the victim, Siddhant’s, house for dinner. They were drinking together and landed up having an argument about an issue they had in school.
 
 The situation aggravated, but before Siddhant’s parents could intervene, the accused pulled out a country-made pistol from his pocket and shot at Siddhant’s head and fled.
 
 On hearing the gun shot, Siddhant’s parents rushed to his room only to find him in a pool of blood. 
 
 Siddhant was rushed to a hospital, where the doctors declared him dead on arrival.
 
 “We received a call at 12am following which a team was sent to the hospital. Efforts were made to nab the accused and who was later apprehended while he was trying to flee from the city,” said MN Tiwari, deputy commissioner of police (outer).
 
 Police said they are yet to ascertain the source of the weapon. 
 
 The families have not given any information about what went wrong and why did the accused shoot their son. They said that both the families were very close and were unaware if the boys ever had any issues between them.
 
 Siddhanth was a Class XII student and the accused was his classmate.
