MUMBAI: The   may have sidelined him in Uttar Pradesh, but it considers controversial godman-turned-politician   a potent weapon to counter the Shiv Sena ahead of the  . The firebreathing Gorakhpur MP is likely to address rallies in Mumbai this weekend.
 
  Ever since they split, the two saffron parties have declared an all-out war against each other. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who has taken it upon himself to wrest control of the BMC from Sena, has been campaigning tirelessly.
  
  To boost the party’s fire power, sources said, it was decided to rope in the five-term MP and priest of the   who is known for his powerful oratory, though most of his speeches hinge on divisive lines.
  
  Adityanath recently kicked up an uproar in Uttar Pradesh when he reportedly said at a rally that the Muzaffarnagar riots could have been prevented had anti-Romeo squads existed back then – the BJP has demanding setting up of such gangs in the state. The 44-year-old leader had also raked up ‘love jihad’ during his campaign trails earlier this month.
  
  Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar confirmed that Adityanath would join the party’s BMC campaign this weekend. The pro-Hindutva speaker would be addressing gatherings at Vakola, Santacruz and Andheri.
  
  However, the decision can backfire too, said party insiders, particularly when the BJP is trying to woo young, educated voters with the clean and non-controversial image of Fadnavis.
  
  “There is no doubt Yogi Adityanath is a firebrand leader and a crowd-puller. But there is a huge difference between his audience in UP and Mumbai. It is possible that his line of thought may not go down well with the enthusiastic, first-time voters,” said party leader.
  
  Adityanath floated Hindu Yuva Vahini, a right-wing outfit, in 2002. Ever since, the HYV has been largely instrumental in his meteoric rise – from a student leader to five-time MP.
