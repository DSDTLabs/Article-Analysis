HYDERABAD: City students facing deportation for alleged immigration fraud in New Zealand have sought  's intervention into their cases before they leave for India on Monday.
City-based agencies that facilitated the students' travel to New Zealand had allegedly submitted fraudulent documents on their behalf to get the job done. The issue has been hanging fire for eight months, with the students forced to camp at the   for more than two weeks.
 
 According to a local newspaper  , the students hope to apply for visas to return to New Zealand from India if the Ombudsman finds that they were unaware of their agents' intention in submitting fraudulent bank account details with their original applications for student visas. “Students are confident that if the Ombudsman rules in their favour, they will have a strong case to make for their deportation status to be re-examined,“ student lawyer   said.
 
 Students are appealing the immigration authorities to reverse the deportation or ders on moral grounds. “There are 100 to 500 agents in India. How would we know that the agent was doing dodgy things? I will stay here as long as I need to cancel these deportation orders,“ said N Manoj, a city-based student told Newshub, a local news channel.
 
 Students fear that if their deportation orders are not reviewedreversed than finding jobs back in India will also be difficult for them.
