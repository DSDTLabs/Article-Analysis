RAJKOT: The chief judicial magistrate first class, Rajkot, on Wednesday, issued notices to Rajkot police commissioner  , police inspectors of detection of crime branch (DCB) and the Thorala police station in-charge, in connection with the alleged custodial deaths of two persons early this month.

 An FIR alleging custodial deaths of small-time bootlegger  , 35, and Shaktisinh Zala, 19, was filed on January 1 by Prakash’s father Devraj Lunagariya. Rajkot police lodged the FIRs against unidentified cops only after public outcry from the powerful   community to which Prakash belonged. M J Solanki, ACP (headquarters), is probing the case.
 
 Lunagariya filed an affidavit in court narrating the sequence of events in which Prakash and Shaktisinh were picked up by Rajkot police from Dhrangadhra town of  , and later handed over first to Bhaktinagar police station, and then to Thorala police station. He also demanded suspension of cops involved in the case as they might try to influence the probe by virtue of their official positions.
 
 Lunagariya’s counsel, Sanjay Pandit, said that he has sought investigation by CBI in all three FIRs lodged by police in this case. “As local police are involved in this crime, there is need of an independent agency to probe the case,” Pandit added. “Court has issued notices to Rajkot police commissioner and concerned cops and asked them to respond by January 13,” he added. 
 
 Prakash Lunagariya and Shaktisinh Zala were killed on January 1 night. Police, however, claimed that they had died after a clash took place between five robbers near Aji river over dividing loot.
