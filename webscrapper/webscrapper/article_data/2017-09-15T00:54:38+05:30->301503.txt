NEW DELHI: The IGI Airport management’s hugely-delayed plan to expand the overcrowded Terminal 1 could get stuck further with   clearly telling   Pvt Ltd (DIAL) that it is not in favour of shifting one-third of its flights from T1 to T2. Instead, it has offered to completely move its domestic operations to T2 if some modifications are made to this Asiad-era terminal. 

 DIAL had asked each of IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir to move one-third of their domestic flights from T1 to T2 by October-end. These low-cost carriers (LCC) had to inform DIAL about their shifting plan by August 31. 
 
 The original plan was to shift SpiceJet and GoAir to T2 and keep T1 for the 139-plane-strong IndiGo as the other two LCCs’ combined fleet is less than half of IndiGo. However, this turned out to be the first in a series of failed plans to decongest T1.
 
 “While the capacity of T2 is below IndiGo’s need by 40 lakh passengers per annum… with some terminal modifications for growth, it would provide a far better customer experience than your proposed split operation between T1 and T2. T1’s capacity has already been exceeded by 40 lakh passengers per annum (meaning it handles more   than its capacity),” IndiGo has written to DIAL CEO I P Rao in a letter dated August 30.
 
 IndiGo, which has over 40% domestic market share, has said it will need additional departure gates and night parking stands to completely shift domestic operations “within a timeline acceptable to us”. 
 
 According to the country’s biggest LCC that operates 1,070 weekly flights from T1, “the best option for our customers is to find a way for some   to move their complete operations to T2” till T1’s expansion work is on. 
 
 Explaining the problem associated with the partial shift, Indigo has said that in such a scenario, the airline will be operating from three terminals — T1, T2 and T3. “This will result in confusion among customers. Given the long distance between the terminals, getting passengers to the right terminal in time will be an insurmountable challenge,” the IndiGo letter, accessed by TOI, says.
 
 The peak-season traffic will start from October, which has already prompted a large number of advance bookings. “Splitting operations at this stage will create widespread confusion and cause grave inconvenience to the travelling public.” Such a split will also increase cost of operations, it adds. “Higher costs for us will lead to higher costs for our customers.” 
 
 Out of the shifted flights and passengers as per DIAL’s plan, two-third will belong to IndiGo alone. Also, airlines like Jet Airways and Air India operate solely out of T2, giving them an edge over IndiGo and SpiceJet that operate out of both T1 and T2. 
 
 Despite repeated attempts, DIAL did not comment about the future steps. Minister of state for aviation Jayant Sinha, who, along with secretary  , is trying to sort out the imbroglio, said he would review the situation shortly.
