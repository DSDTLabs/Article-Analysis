NEW DELHI:   across the capital held a   on Tuesday morning asking the ministry of environment, forest and climate change to enforce the National Clean Air Programme at the earliest. The protesters, supported by Greenpeace India, also sought a sector-wise breakup of how a 35% reduction in emissions is planned over the next three years.

 Carrying banners that read “Break free   coal, clean air now”, the activists said stationary sources like power plants need to be looked at as they are major contributors to air pollution.
 
 “We have allowed ourselves enough to become the victims of air pollution, something that can be easily mitigated by taking concrete and right steps. We are here because we need to see change, which is only possible if the government’s actions towards resolving the issue are discussed on public platforms so that we know where we are heading,” said Ritesh Dwivedi, an activist at the protest.
 
 Airpocalypse II, a recent report released by Greenpeace India, had highlighted that over 80% of cities where air quality was monitored are severely polluted. This impacts 47 million children across the country. tnn
