KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister   told reporters on Sunday that   will soon name decide later whether to field a candidate for the   seat in the state, triggering speculation about which way she will tilt.

 Given the assembly arithmetic in Bengal, Trinamool will win five seats and still be left with surplus votes. It can allocate its extra votes to Congress, which is short of around nine MLAs to win a seat. A Trinamool-Congress pact is seen as a strong possibility in the wake of the growing bonhomie between the two parties.
 
 Sharmistha Mukherjee, President Pranab Mukherjee’s daughter and spokesperson of Delhi Congress, is seen as one of the probables for the Rajya Sabha berth.Bengal   chief Adhir Chowdhury, a known Banerjee baiter, on Sunday said: “We will go by what the AICC says.”
 
 On Sunday, however, Chowdhury toned down his statement, “We will go by what the AICC says.” The Election Commission’s schedule has May 29 as the nomination deadline.
 
 Banerjee’s meeting with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi for discussions on presidential polls was the primary reason for unease in Bengal Congress ranks.
 
 A section in the state Congress is keen to throw its weight behind the Left Front’s 31 MLAs for a “consensus” candidate. While CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury has expressed his desire not to contest for a third term, sources said a final decision is likely on Tuesday.
 
 An alliance with Trinamool, sources argued, would be detrimental for the party in the state. While Congress had 44 MLAs, five have since switched over to Trinamool and Banerjee nominated one of the defectors to Rajya Sabha on Sunday.
