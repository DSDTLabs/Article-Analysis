Singer   was in town recently to record a song for composer and his college friend,  . The song titled, I Am CEO is a quirky song.   says, ���It is the opening song in the movie and has really quirky lyrics. The hero, played by Nakul, pulls in international celebrities and gives them a local twist. The song will be funny, peppy and fast-paced. The movie revolves around the hero���s dreams.��� 
The duo recorded the song for about an hour and spent the rest of the time sharing college memories. ���We have been friends for the past 14 years and I remember we used to finish college, head to Unwind Centre and jam for a while. Musician   used to join us, too, and we would jam till the next morning. We even used to say, ���one day when you become a composer, Sid and I will sing for you.��� And now, it has actually happened,��� shares an elated Siddharth.
