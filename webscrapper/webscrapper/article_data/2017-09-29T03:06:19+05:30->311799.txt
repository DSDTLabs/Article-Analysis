VARANASI:   vice-chancellor   has created more trouble for himself as a video of his attacks on female students for protesting against sexual harassment of a fellow student went viral on Thursday.

 In the video, Tripathi can be heard asking students, “Why did you protest and bring dishonour to the university?”
 
 He was interacting with female students living in the university hostels at Triveni Complex on Wednesday evening. 
 
 In the video, recorded by some participants on cellphone and uploaded online, Tripathi is heard saying, “Koi bhi dharam ki baat karne ka adhikaar usi ko hai jo khud dharam par chale. Tum ye bataao ki ladkiyon ne dharm ka paalan kiya, ki ek ladki ki asmita ko lekar bazar me pahunchin? (Those who are righteous themselves have the right to talk about righteousness. You tell me whether the girls did the right thing by raking up the issue of modesty of a fellow girl student in public like this?)”
 
 The VC was reacting to a student who asked him, “Sir, aap dharam se bataiye ki kya ladkiyon par lathicharge karna theek hai? (Sir, you tell us fairly whether the baton charge on girls was correct?)” “Bees baar tumhari teachers ne samjhaya (Your teachers talked to you so many times),” Tripathi berated the female students. 
 
 When the same student interjected, he interrupted her and asked, “Kai baar hua hadsa, zara batao? Kai baar hostel aaya, koi ek baar bataya haadsa hua? (How many times did untoward incidents happen? I came to the hostels so many times. Did anyone tell me once about such an incident occuring earlier?)”
