Chandigarh: Re-incarnating the era of birth control and family planning, in the pre-independent glow of India, Atul Pethe, famous Marathi playwright and director dished out an inspiring production named ‘Samaj Swasthya’ focusing on Professor Raghunath Dhondo Karve’s revolutionary contribution to India’s modern day understanding of contraceptives. 

 The play was the second last instalment of the ongoing Rang Sangam Theater Festival at   organised by Chandigarh Sangeet Natak Akademi.
 
 Written and directed by Pethe, the play revolved around the life of Professor Karve’s tryst with severe opposition from the conservationists objecting to his forward thinking ideologies of intercourse, morality of sexual desire, the plight of women socially branded as ‘goods’ or prostitutes having lost their virginity by violating the vow of chastity and the deeply pervasive evil of caste system, which he argued only existed as a permanent oppression of human pluralism and originates from human convenience. 
 
 Set in 1932, Mumbai, and written in Marathi, the dialogues weave the picture of ancient disputes and prevalent sexual ignorance accurately. B R Ambedkar’s stand on Dr Karve’s understanding of the caste system is also showcased very closely.
 
 The narrative questions and co-relates the epidemic of mental repression plaguing the nation today like it was then, in comparison to the older times where people were more progressive in thought and open to acceptance. 
 
 Dr Karve also used instances of Kunti bearing   out of a wedlock, Draupadi’s marriage with the Pandava’s, Krishna’s reputation of romancing his consorts in the forest as an example of loving without boundaries as well with the self proclaimed custodians of mythology and religion, thus paving a way for self interpretation of scriptures.
