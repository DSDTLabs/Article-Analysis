MUMBAI: The aggregator cab driver who was killed by bikers in   in Govandi on Monday was the sole bread-winner in his family and had taken a loan to buy a car one and a half years ago. Salim   (38) is survived by his wife, who is a homemaker, and three kids, one of whom is a special needs child and another only 11 months old. With no means of income left, the family wants the loan to be waived.

 “The special needs child is only 11 years old son,” said Shaikh’s nephew Azaz. The family stays on the mezzanine floor of a hutment. Azaz said Shaikh was employed with a private company but left the job as he thought driving a cab through an aggregator would fetch him more money. “He took a loan and bought a car. Now, the bank will take away the car and whatever my uncle invested in it will go waste. And what about his family and the children’s education?’’ he asked.
