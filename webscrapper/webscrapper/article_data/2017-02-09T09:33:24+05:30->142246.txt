AURANGABAD: The city's water supply system faces an uncertain future as the 24-hour deadline set by the   for the civic body to clear pending electricity dues of Rs 32 crore ended on Wednesday. 

 Power supply for the city's street lights has, however, been restored following intervention by the Bombay high court's Aurangabad bench.
 
  (rural) had on Tuesday evening sent a notice to the municipal commissioner asking him to pay the dues in the next 24 hours for the electricity consumed for the water supply schemes. 
 
 "The deadline was till Wednesday evening. So far we have not received a proper communication from AMC. We may go ahead with our plan (cutting power supply to water facilities) by Thursday," Sunil Jadhav, a senior MSEDCL official told TOI. 
 
 Earlier, the power company had disconnected power supply to the city's street lights. The civic body and a Shiv Sena leader had approached the high court on Tuesday seeking directions to the MSEDCL to restore power supply to the street lights.
 
 Tuesday's notice referred to a February 3 meeting between the civic body officials and the MSEDCL representatives, during which the power company had raised the issue of non-payment of tariff. 
 
 The civic body rejected MSEDCL's claim.  , the chief accounts officer, said the civic body owes only the December 2016 tariff of Rs 3.23 crore. He said the dispute involves the period between September 2014 and October 2016, when the water supply system was being handled by the erstwhile Aurangabad Water Utility Company. During this period, the civic body resisted MSEDCL move to charge commercial rates as a private company had taken over the water supply system. t
