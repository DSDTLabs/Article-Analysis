CHANDIGARH: Haryana agriculture minister O P Dhankar said chief minister   had made it clear both in his printed speech and oral remarks that there was no   with Punjab on the   Link canal issue since the   is final and Haryana’s execution petition is listed for hearing in July.

 Dhankar, who attended the 28th Northern Zonal Council meeting along with the chief minister on Friday, made these remarks while reacting to the press release from the Punjab chief minister’s office after the meeting. He said the press release was “misleading and incorrect”.
 
 Dhankar clarified that states had agreed to the suggestion from Union home minister Rajnath Singh to hold meetings at the level of officers and political executives on all other contentious issues of power and water sharing. Dhankar said the Union home minister agreed with the Haryana chief minister that while all states make serious attempts to resolve issues through dialogue under the aegis of the zonal council, failure to arrive at a resolution would leave only recourse to courts as the final option.
 
 The agriculture minister said that when Haryana pointed out that it was an issue of national concern that despite the Indus Water Treaty more than 3 MAF water goes to Pakistan, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said that happened only during the monsoon. 
 
 On this, the Haryana chief minister replied that Haryana is more than willing to accept this water even during the monsoon, Dhankar said, adding that Punjab did not react when the Haryana chief minister asserted that construction of SYL canal was a must for water to come to the parched fields of Haryana, whether during monsoon or otherwise. 
 
 Dhankar said the chairperson of the meeting suggested serious deliberation on contentious issues between states in which no state or UT had yet taken the matter to the courts.
 
  These remarks came while discussing items on the agenda like share of power for UT Chandigarh in Renuka and Kishau dams, construction of 27 mini hydel projects on Bhakhra Main line being opposed by Haryana, and short supply of water to Bharatpur in Rajasthan.
