 I have never spoken about this issue before, but I suspect that my husband is  . I have been married for the last 3 years and his guy friends always accompany us on our outings, be it a movie date, a vacation or any other celebration. Not only that, he even goes out to meet them after work for drinks and comes back really late in the night. Initially, I didnâ€™t get bothered about the same, but now it is getting too much to handle. I crave for some lone time with him. He barely gets intimate with me. Mostly we get intimate when he has to go out with his friends and it feels like compensation sex. Could he be gay? 
 
 
  
 Well, to clarify your doubts, I don't think he is displaying behavior of being a gay, and of course we will never know till he comes forward and explains himself. But with what you have described, it seems that he is a person who has an extrovert bent of mind and loves to be with people. Balance is the key in a marriage, which clearly is missing here. May be you haven't expressed the need of being with him alone, which actually should happen naturally, but now you need to be a bit categorical in expressing that both of you need time alone. Chances are that he might get defensive, to which you need to handle calmly and tell him that this relationship needs good cementing for future years and its healthy bonding.
  
  I would also suggest that you need to make some plans and be pro-active in taking few decisions of going out, be it movies, plays or comedy shows. You can also visit a psychologist if both of you are not on same page where sex is concerned. Expressing your feelings and doubts in a streamlined manner helps many couples.
