NEW DELHI: Taking on   for the his attack on PM Narendra Modi and the  , party president   said the  's public meeting on Sunday was a ' ' which highlighted the Gandhi family's "increasing irrelevance".

 
 "During today's 'Parivar Akrosh Rally', you will see abject India-hatred on display. After all, the Congress cannot digest that 125 crore Indians have seen through their anti-development and highly divisive politics. Congress's efforts to create divisions are fully exposed," Shah tweeted.
 
 
  
 He also questioned the contributions of four generations of the Gandhi family. "A dynasty and their courtiers, who were sent out of state after state by 'Jan Aadesh' now pretend to represent 'Jan Akrosh.' Today's Congress rally is nothing but a 'Parivar Akrosh Rally' which highlights their increasing irrelevance," he added.
 
 The BJP chief said if the Congress wanted to see 'Jan Akrosh', it should see the results of election after election where the party was "comprehensively defeated across the length and breadth of India". 
 
 Shah's counter offensive was complemented by law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad who said in Patna that Rahul was trying to instil a bit of enthusiasm into his "demoralised" party cadres.
 
 "Rahul Gandhi's rally in Delhi has been organised in the quest of power, though he has given it the name of 'Jan Akrosh' (people"s resentment). He has claimed that his party will win the assembly polls in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh as well as the Lok Sabha polls next year. He is daydreaming," Prasad told reporters.
 
 "We have no problems with Gandhi's daydreaming and whatever gimmicks he resorts to in order to hide his shortcomings. But the language he has used against the prime minister is deplorable," Prasad added.
