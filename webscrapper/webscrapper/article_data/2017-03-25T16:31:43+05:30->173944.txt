 PORVORIM: The liquor industry must have heaved a sigh of relief on Friday, as, except for a marginal hike in excise duty on beer manufactured in the state, and levy for possession and sale of molasses by manufactures, taxation on the industry is minimal. 
 
 Speaking after presenting the budget, chief minister   also promised to issue directions on Monday to provide   that operate along national highways.
 
 Molasses is bought from the   for distilling alcohol and is also used as cattle feed, but, currently, manufacturers are not charged for either its sale or possession. Now, they will be charged a total of Rs 50,000 as licence and processing fee. It has also been proposed to charge an additional fee of Rs 1 lakh on manufactures of high bouquet spirits, who import concentrated alcoholic beverages to sell to other manufactures within and outside the state.
 
 The liquor industry has always been heavily taxed, and even during March 2016, a similar pinch was felt when the excise duty on   and beer manufactured in Goa or imported was raised, and import fee on bottled wine brought into the state hiked from Rs 6 to Rs 10 per litre.
 
 A government official said that comparatively the liquor industry felt a milder pinch this time. “The industry will be affected if the SC order becomes applicable in toto, which may be why the finance minister has not touched the industry much,” he said, and added that GST may have also influenced the decision to downplay taxation on the industry, since its impact is not yet known.
