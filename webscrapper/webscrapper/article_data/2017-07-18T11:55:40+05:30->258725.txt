LUCKNOW: The state government on Monday   — one of them retired now — for their alleged role in irregularities committed during the execution of Rs 1,590-crore   Project. 

 An official spokesperson of the state government confirmed to TOI that the serving IAS officer has already been handed over a copy of the charge-sheet. This officer supervised the project it different capacities during the   government. 
 
 “The charge-sheet would be handed over to the retired officer after the department of personnel and training (DoPT) seeks the mandatory approval from the Union home ministry,” the spokesperson said.
 
 The principal secretary, home, on the other hand, told TOI that the process to hand over the probe into the multi-thousand-crore scam to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is on. The CM has already given his nod to hand over the probe into the irregularities to the Central agency.
 
 Just after taking over as the CM, Adity Nath Yogi, went for a spot inspection of the project and prima facie found grave irregularities. He set up a fact-finding committee under retired HC judge, Justice Alok Kumar Singh. The panel indicted these two IAS officers and several other engineers and officers of the irrigation department for their role. 
 
 After this, the CM set up another panel under cabinet minister Suresh Khanna to analyse the report of Justice Singh Committee and advise the government on the legal course of action against the guilty. The Khanna committee recommended a CBI inquiry into the entire project, departmental proceedings against the two IAS officers and criminal cases against the engineers. Subsequently, the government lodged FIRs against the engineers and now charge-sheeted two IAS officers.
 
 The serving IAS officer will soon submit his reply to the government while for the retired IAS officer, the DOPT — after seeking approval from the home ministry — proceed further.
