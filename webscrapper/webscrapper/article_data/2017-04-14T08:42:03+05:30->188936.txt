BHOPAL: As the tug of war over textbooks drags on, city-based schools have asked   for a year's breather in implementing order to use only   books from Classes I to VIII. Sahodaya group of schools in   Thursday claimed the board has given green signal to continue using non-NCERT books this session. 

 "We have taken verbal permission from the CBSE office for implementing their orders regarding NCERT books from the next academic session. With consent of all CBSE schools in city, we sought exempt on its execution from June 2017," said secretary, Sahodaya group of CBSE schools, Sojan Joseph. He said that the schools wrote to the regional office of CBSE in   seeking a year's time. Many schools in Bhopal have already started the session with books from private publishers as they have done for years.
 
 In one of the circulars issued by the regional office of   (CBSE/RO(AJM)/CIRNCERT(BOOKS)/2017-18) dated April 1, 2017, the board asks all the schools to comply with the orders as soon as possible and reiterates that NCERT books are mandatory. "Parents should not be coerced to buy textbooks of private publishers or additional textbooks by the school authorities and all schools must mandatorily use NCERT textbooks from June 2017," reads the circular, a copy of which is with TOI.
