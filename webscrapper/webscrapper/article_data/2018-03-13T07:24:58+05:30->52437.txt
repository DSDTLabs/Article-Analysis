NAGPUR: The decomposed body of Ramesh Zodape, a labour contractor, was found at a desolate place, off the road that connects Isasani locality to Mihan’s boundary, on Sunday. He had a hand-written suicide note in his pocket, blaming three persons, including a city police officer, for not paying the money due to him.

 Ramesh had left home at Chandra Nagar on March 6, informing the family that he was heading towards Seoni, Madhya Pradesh, to meet the persons who were supposed to settle his payments. The deceased’s son Mahesh claimed that he did not know the names or other details of his father’s dealings. He said his mother   may know the names of the persons who were supposed to pay his father. Ramesh’s family was clueless why his phone was switched off since then, but thought he was in the villages to seek labourers.
 
 Hingna police were informed about the body by local residents, who were alerted by the strong stench from the decomposed body. The mobile phone helped Hingna police inform his family through his son Mahesh’s number in the dialled list.
 
 While police claimed that forensic experts of   (GMCH) have indicated suicide by consuming poison, the family members asserted that there could be foul play behind the incident. They pointed out that he was supposed to head towards MP, but his body was found in another direction.
 
 Hingna police station senior PI   said Ramesh is likely to have visited a site around a kilometre away from where his body was found. “He has mentioned three names in a suicide note, stating that one was supposed to pay him Rs1 lakh while the other had dues of Rs1.5 lakh. The cop mentioned in the note had allegedly not paid him after the construction of his house. We will visit the site to quiz labourers whether the deceased had really reached the site,” he said.
 
 Hingna police have registered a case of accidental death.
