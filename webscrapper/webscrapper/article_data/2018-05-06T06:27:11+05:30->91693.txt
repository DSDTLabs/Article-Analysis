JAIPUR: Priya   (27), kingpin of a high-profile blackmailing racket, and booked for the   of a businessman with the help of her boyfriend and a friend, frequently prowled for wealthy men on over a dozen online dating apps for blackmailing.

 She had accounts on several dating apps and ran her own web site too. The cops said that in some instances she used fake names. “She always zeroed in on wealthy targets to blackmail them. Her targets were men with considerable reputation in the society. They never dared going to the police due to fear of infamy. But   managed to trick her into believing that he was richest among all her previous targets,” said an official.
 
 Seth, who has been accused of murder of Sharma with help of her boyfriend Dushyant Kamra (20) and Lakshya Walia (21), told cops that Sharma met her on an online dating app Tinder.
 
 “After she came out of the bail in March this year in a blackmailing case lodged against her in Vaishali Nagar police station, she decided to prey on a multi-millionaire hoping it would solve her financial problems,” the official said.
 
 During interrogation, the police found that Kamra and Seth had rented a three bedroom hall flat in Bajaj Nagar. “The posed themselves as a couple to get the flat,” official said, adding they suspect that forged documents may have been used to get the flat on rent.
 
 After Sharma had arrived at her flat on Tuesday night, she abducted him and checked his bank account. “It came as a rude shock for her to find that his bank account had only a few thousand. He called his other friends but couldn’t arrange for the ransom money,” the official added.
 
 When quizzed about the reason why they need ransom, Kamra and Seth gave contradictory statements. “Seth said Kamra was pressuring her for the money as he needed to clear debt. Kamra, on the other hand, said she was addicted to a fast lifestyle,” the official said.
 
 The trio were sent to seven days police custody.
