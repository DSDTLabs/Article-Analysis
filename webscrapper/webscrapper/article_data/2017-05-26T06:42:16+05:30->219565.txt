While just a week ago, several countries in Asia and South East Asia re gion were swept into the massive One Belt One Road ( ) initiative of China, India, in a quiet and unobtrusive manner, reached out to the $2.6 trillion regional economy of  , under its Act East policy. 

 Participating in the 25th year celebrations of India-ASEAN partnership, a delegation of innovators and start-ups to the   and Conference, organised by AIBC ( ), with the belief that the leap to the next growth phase will ride on the huge potential for SMEs and private sectors.Didar Singh, FICCI secretary general, is clear India has a definite and different approach to push trade between the two steadily growing economies despite China's aggressive forays in infrastructure involving all SE Asian countries. 
 
 He said, “India and ASEAN both have similar development scenarios and challenges, whether it is Indonesia or  , besides having physical and historical linkages. Moreover, India is quickly moving its start-up ecosystem from disruption to innovation and this is where I think the return on investment will be huge.Private partnerships will be main driver.“
 
 On the other hand, China's governmentdriven, huge investments seems an attractive reality for countries like Malaysia, as was evident from the view of Datuk J Jayasiri, secretary general of international trade and industry ministry (MITI). Expressing excitement at the OBOR initiative, he said, “This harks back to the time when   port was the most significant trade post and now this route will bring prosperity again.“
 
 But he quickly pointed out that India and ASEAN, and particularly Malaysia have an immense potential for economic engagement through private sector.
 
 This also found resonance with other experts and speakers present at the two-day conference, where parleys on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was being touted as resolving soon what with TPP failing to come through. India is actively involved in the RCEP negotiations which when established will have a combined GDP of US$23 trillion with a 32% share of the world goods exports. 
 
 T S Tirumurti, Indian high commissioner to Malaysia, who has been actively involved with promoting bilateral ties with ASEAN , said, “With Make in India, Startup India and Digital India, it is important that we become part of the regional supply chain feeding into the global supply chain. The natural propeller in India-ASEAN trade is the `centrality' of ASEAN that India adheres to. This epitomises strength in their oneness and this principle also acknowledges the criticality of the role ASEAN plays in the region.“
