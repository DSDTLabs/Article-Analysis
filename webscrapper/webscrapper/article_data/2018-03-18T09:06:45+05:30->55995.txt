CHENNAI:  , propaganda secretary of the now-defunct AIADMK Amma faction led by  , has quit politics, after accusing Dhinakaran of ignoring “Anna and Dravidam” in his newly floated political outfit,  . The firebrand speaker sought to put to rest the speculations of re-joining TTV camp or any other political party in the future.

 He said he would associate himself with literary circles, helping students improve oratorical skills. “Dhinakaran believes that he can run the party by ignoring Anna and Dravidam. I wish him success. I will not seek answers from him since he is a leader, whom I celebrated and respected once. He has done a murder in broad daylight,” Sampath told reporters in Kanyakumari. Sampath said he was not taken into confidence by the party leadership before deciding the new party name.
 
 Responding to the allegations, Dhinakaran said he sought three names bearing Dravidar in it, but they were registered by the rivals before the election commission. “It is an interim arrangement by us before retrieving the two-leaves symbol. Amma symbolizes Periyar, Annadurai and MGR. I won’t accept Sampath’s remarks belittling our leader,” Dhinakaran said. “We moved the court to get two-leaves symbol. If I float a new party, I would lose my rights as a petitioner, which is why I prayed before the court for an interim arrangement,” he said.
 
 Party sources claimed that Sampath was to be one of the speakers at the party launch in Melur, but he remained inaccessible throughout that day. “Despite repeated attempts by the partymen, he gave a cold shoulder,” said a senior leader. The former deputy propaganda secretary of AIADMK, Sampath quit the AIADMK in January last year when the party was headed for a split after the passing away of Jayalalithaa. He even returned the Innova car presented by Jayalalithaa for party activities. Four days later, he called on Sasikala at Jayalalithaa’s Poes Garden residence and revived his political fortunes.
