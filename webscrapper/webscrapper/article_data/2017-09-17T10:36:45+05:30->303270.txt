BENGALURU: Call them initial hiccups or  , technical glitches plaguing the   (GSTN) will persist for some more time. Most of them are expected to be resolved by October-end, chairman of the   (GoM),  , said on Saturday.

 Modi, who's also the deputy chief minister of Bihar, appealed to traders to avoid last minute rush to file taxes, which would overload the IT network. The GoM formed to look into the   on Saturday.
 
 
  
  
 
 Briefing the media after meeting the top brass of Infosys, the IT vendor for GST, Modi justified the glitches, calling them a part of GST's “stabilisation“ process. He said the Union government is playing a proactive role and hopes to resolve all problems coming in the way of GST.
 
 Modi said Infosys has assured them that most of the technical glitches would be addressed by October 30. “We expect 80 per cent of them to be rectified by then,“ he added. Explaining the problems, revenue secretary for the Union government, Hasmukh Adhia, said: “They crop up when someone wants to make changes in the tax form. Some forms are not available on the website.“
 
 However, sources present at the GoM meeting said the IT infrastructure was illequipped to deal with the glitches. “The fact that a GoM had to be constituted to oversee and monitor the fixing of these technical problems suggests that Infosys needed to be better equipped to handle them,“ said a minister.
 
 
 
 
 When asked whether Infosys had failed in providing competent services, Adhia said: “They have not failed.It's just that initial hiccups and other issues have to be sorted out. There is no largescale failure on the part of Infosys,“ said Adhia.
 
 When asked whether the government failed to identify the glitches before putting the system in place, Modi said trial runs were conducted but the technical challenges being faced now were identified only after implementation.
 
 The GoM was formed at the recent GST Council meeting to iron out the I-T problems faced while filing returns.
