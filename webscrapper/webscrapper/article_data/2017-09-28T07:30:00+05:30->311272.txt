Chandigarh: Unhappy with the decision of Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) rejecting its revised power tariff petition, the UT electricity department has challenged the order.

 The commission in its order on September 23 refused to approve funds to meet the revenue gap of Rs 208 crore of the department. The refusal has come as a major blow to the department already reeling under a financial crunch. In anticipation of funds getting approved, the department has already incurred an expenditure of Rs 242 crore from the consolidated fund.
 
 The commission did not approve Rs 33.74 crore on account of depreciation on gross fixed assets (GFA). The commission directed the department to approach the Union government to provide budgetary support to meet the revenue gap. UT superintending engineer M P Singh said they had to challenge the decision of the commission as it will take a toll on the financial health of the department.
 
 The department caters to 2.12 lakh consumers, of whom 1.75 lakh are from domestic category. The commission had also refused to reduce the target of transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, which the department termed as unrealistic. The commission has set a target of T&D losses at 13.75% for current fiscal year.
 
 As per norms of the commission, T&D losses cannot be more than 13.75% of the total power purchased. But the losses have been above 15% in the past three years, which has cost the state around Rs 40 crore. The department suffered T&D losses of 15.1 % in 2014, which rose to 15.17% in 2015, and to 15.24 % in 2016. Ageing infrastructure and overloading of transformers are the main reasons for the losses. At present, there is only one 220-KV sub-station, 13 66-KV sub-stations and five 33-KV sub-stations. Five 66-KV sub-stations have completed their life span of 25 years.
