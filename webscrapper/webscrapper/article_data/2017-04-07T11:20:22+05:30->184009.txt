  Two days back, the prices of chicken and mutton were Rs 165 per kg and Rs 400 per kg, respectively. "As Navratras have ended, and the wedding season is on, the demand for meat has increased. 
 
 "Besides, costumers have limited options now, as there is no buffalo meat," said  , owner of a meat shop near bus stand, here. 
 
  "Nonvegetarians can't change their habit overnight. Even Hindus eat meat, including buffalo meat, there is no denying. When such a large population eats meat, then the government can't just ban slaughterhouses. 
 
 "If the slaughterhouses were illegal, they should have been served notices and their conditions should be improved. The government should have resolved the problem by now, because chicken and mutton prices are increasing due to this, and will continue to increase," said a customer.
