LUCKNOW:   banned all types of protests on the campus, as also writing or sticking posters on the walls. “Anyone who flouts the order will have to pay a penalty of Rs 25,000,” stated proctor Prof Vinod Singh on Saturday. The new academic session will begin on Monday. 

 Students of the fresh batch have been asked to carry with them all the time the allotment letter bearing their latest photograph. Those already enrolled have been asked to carry their old identity cards and recent pay slip. During surprise inspection, students will have to show relevant documents, said the proctor. He also asked students to avoid walking in groups on the campus and warned senior students against ragging the new batch. 
 
 Singh asked students to either go home or to the hostel room, or visit the library after classes instead of loitering on the campus. Students have been warned their identity cards will be seized if they brought with them any outsider to the campus and their parents will be called to settle the matter. 
 
 Students have been asked to avoid bringing four-wheelers to the university. Any student found carrying arms and ammunitions on the campus will face disciplinary action. Chewing tobacco, or smoking is completely prohibited, reads the proctor’s order. Hostellers have been instructed not to accommodate outsiders and in case family members are visiting them, they must inform the provost in advance and seek permission to take them to their room. Singh warned that if outsiders are found staying in hostels, it will lead to expulsion of the student in whose name the room is allotted and FIR will be lodged against him/her.
