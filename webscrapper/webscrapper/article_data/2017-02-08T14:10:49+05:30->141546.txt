To celebrate the spirit of Valentine's Day 2017, it is important to say and do things for those we love. Cajoling us from the moment we first opened our eyes, helping us take our first steps, soothing us through heartbreaks to being our constant support, parents, without doubt, are our forever Valentine. And nothing will please them more than some heartfelt messages from their kids, reminding them of how precious they are...

 “Without you there would be no me. It's as simple as that! I love you with all my heart. Happy Valentine's Day!”
 
 “As my Mom and Dad …as my friend… as a Valentine… you’re the best!”
