Disgraced movie mogul   is using an email allegedly written by   star   to rebuff  's claim that the producer sexually assaulted her in 1997. 

 Reportedly, according to a statement from Weinstein's attorney  , two people whom McGowan claims to have informed about her alleged assault at the time - her then-manager and Affleck - have denied that the   reported the attack to them. 
 
 "She never told me nor did I ever infer that she was attacked by anyone. Any accounts to the contrary are false. I have no knowledge about anything Rose did or claimed to have done," Affleck allegedly wrote in an email to Weinstein, according to Brafman. 
 
 McGowan has previously claimed in a series of tweets that Affleck knew about the alleged assault. Brafman said that McGowan's claims that the film producer sexually assaulted her is 'a bold lie'. "Watching the 'performance' by Rose McGowan as she looks to promote her new book however, has made it impossible to remain quiet as she tries to smear Mr. Weinstein with a bold lie that is denied not only by Mr. Weinstein himself, but by at least two witnesses," he said.
