HYDERABAD: The   on Thursday directed the state government and HMDA, revenue and municipal officials to forthwith stop constructions being carried out by a realty firm, ' ' at 150-acre government land on Devatalagutta near   in Ranga Reddy district until further orders. The court gave this interim order while hearing a PIL filed by Namram Reddy of   who questioned the 'indifference' of the authorities to the illegal constructions in government land. 

 The bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice Shameem Akther studied a report submitted in a sealed cover by the committee they constituted to look into the allegations. The three-member committee was headed by A Venkateswara Reddy, high court judicial registrar. The report confirmed that several illegal structures came up in the government land. Y Rama Rao, the counsel for HMDA, too confirmed the large-scale irregularities by the realty firm for years together.
 
 The bench went through the photos and the report furnished by the committee and questioned the silence of the officials. When PSP Suresh Kumar, counsel for the petitioner, expressed an apprehension that the officials who kept quiet all these years might now go to the extent of regularising the plots in favour of 450 persons who bought them from Pride India Builders, the bench said: " No Construction. No Erection of any structures, statues etc. Nothing shall be permitted there until further orders." 
 
 When the advocates appearing for the realty firm sought to refute the contentions, the bench asked them to file their objections in writing. The court sought to know how the constructions were allowed in the land in survey numbers 78, 79 and 80, falling under the conservation zone. "Authorities shall now ensure that there are no further constructions in the area until further orders," the bench said. It should be ensured that none occupies the homes in the meantime, the bench said.The case will come up again for hearing in June.
