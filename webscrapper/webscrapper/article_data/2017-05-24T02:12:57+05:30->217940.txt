GURUGRAM: The MCG will be conducting a tree plantation and adoption drive along with   (RWA) of the city ahead of monsoon.

 MCG officials said they had alreday spoken to multiple RWAs in the city in order to identify spots within their areas where trees can be planted, and to accordingly raise a request for the saplings.
 
 “Every year we get requests from the resident’s bodies for plantation. This year we have decided to involve them at an earlier stage. We are telling them to adopt each sapling and then takeover its responsibility in terms of watering and saving it,” said an official.
 
 He added that every year multiple saplings are planted, but many of them die as no one looks after them. Making residents responsible for the saplings will ensure that the saplings sustain and turn into trees.
 
 Resident welfare associations said they will ensure full support. 
 
 “We welcome the initiative. However, residents should not look at tihs as a photo opportunity and must responsibly take care of the saplings,” said  , RWA member, sector 40. He added that they have decided to revive the green belt from their sector up to Cyber Park.
 
 Residents from sector 45 are also working with the corporation in the same regard. “We had asked the corporation officials for around 300 saplings along with tree guards.
 
  The officials have in turn asked us for the assurance of the saplings turning into trees,” said Surender Kaushik, resident welfare association president, sector 45.
