MUMBAI:   on May 3 directed the state government to conduct a survey on vacancies among doctors in government and civic hospitals "on a priority basis" and take steps to recruit staff. 

 Unhappy with the state of affairs of vacancies pending since 2012, a bench of Justices Naresh Patil and G S Kulkarni ordered a special recruitment drive.
 
 "The government will conduct a survey in respect of vacancies of medical officers and essential staff in hospitals attached to the corporation and civil/government hospitals on a priority basis. The recruitment drive will be then undertaken," directed the bench. It was hearing a PIL by Rakesh Bhamare in 2015. If proposals are pending with  , they have to be "expedited", said the  , directing approval for proposals for appointment of senior doctors, HODs and other posts.
 
 Bhamare, from Nashik district, had relied on   to allege tardiness in filling vacancies by the state public health department and civic authorities, some dating back six years. 
 
 The HC said the government had to provide infrastructure, medical staff, and funds for civic-run hospitals, which the state last week said it had taken steps to do so. The HC posted the matter to June 15 and gave time authorities to reply to Bhamare's contempt plea against officials for non-compliance of a 2016 order to form a special committee to inspect and review conditions of municipal hospitals.
