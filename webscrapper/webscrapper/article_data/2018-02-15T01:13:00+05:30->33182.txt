CHENNAI: For the first time   may be done by contract workers at the city airport as   ( ) has roped in ex-servicemen for the purpose to tide over the staff shortage. 

 Around 30 to 40 ex-servicemen have been inducted and are being trained. 
 
 Personnel who are directly recruited into the IB and policemen deputed from different state police force man the immigration counters and screen passport and other documents. These officers are considered as the final gatekeepers and have the final say in allowing a foreigner into the country.
 
 Retired immigration officers are of the view that handing over such a sensitive duty to retired paramilitary personnel may not be a good step as they may not have the set of skills acquired by the IB officials. 
 
 The move to recruit ex-servicemen comes after there have been complaints from passengers of long queues at immigration counters at the international terminal. Though   has been requesting for more personnel to man the counters, the immigration wing was not able to allot people. 
 
  ministry approved the plan to bring in retired personnel from the forces on contract in November last year. 
 
 Airport sources said “Around 30 to 40 staff are needed to staff the counters. These are young people who have many years of service left. They have been selected after an interview and extensive training is being given.” 
 
 However, officials said the “Most of the screening is now automated. The staff have to just scan the passport and look at the data to find out if the details match or whether there is any look out circular or travel restriction is popping up against a passenger’s name. Seasoned officers watch the body language too. But with automation that may not be needed. Besides, there will be IB staff who will be monitoring the passengers.”
 
 Senior officials also have access to the camara feed installed at the immigration counters through which passengers pass by.
