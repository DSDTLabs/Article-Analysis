UPDAIPUR: A part of heritage park   is undergoing a transformation. It will soon house the state’s first   with a variety of local and scheduled species. A zoo was earlier running in the park for several years. Later, the animals were shifted to Sajjangarh Biological Park. Now, Gulab Bagh is being converted into an exclusive bird park. It may take around ten months for the project to complete, sources said.

 Spread over an an area of 51,135.47 sq m, the project is estimated to cost around Rs 11.50 crore. An assistance of Rs 8 crore has been granted by the Centre while the rest of the amount would be pooled in by   and the UIT.
 
 The project comprises a water bird area, enclosures for caged birds, free zone and a learning centre along with public facilities. There would be a wide range of species like Carolina Duck, Emperor Goose, Scarlet Ibis, Manchurian Crane, Chilean Flamingo, White Stork, Ross Turaco, Great Blue Turaco, Victoria Crowned Pigeon, Military Macaw, Dusky Lory, Green-Napped Rainbow Lorikeet, Yellow-Bibbed Lory, Chattering Lory, etc.
 
 “Gulab Bagh is a heritage park made in 1862. We conceived the idea of turning the place into a bird park after the zoo stopped functioning so that large number of people visiting the park get to see birds in their natural environment,” Rahul Bhatnagar, chief conservator of forests (wildlife) told TOI. Over 50 varieties of scheduled and local birds could be seen here.
