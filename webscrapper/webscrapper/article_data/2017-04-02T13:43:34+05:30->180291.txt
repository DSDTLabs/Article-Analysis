Back in 2015, when Shiboprasad Mukherjee and Nandita Roy's blockbuster   had released, megastar   had taken to Twitter to express his views on the film. He wrote, "'Belaseshe' ... the film in Bengali with subtitles.... it's simplicity grabs you by the heart and converts you into a human!" Clearly, senior Bachchan was moved by the soulful movie that clashed with  's  , where Big B was playing 
the lead. 
 
  
  
 
 
 This year too, it looks like, history is repeating itself. Shiboprasad's ambitious next   is releasing on the same day as Big B's Sarkar 3. Speaking about it, Shiboprasad said, "It was an unbelievably overwhelming gesture when Amitabh Bachchan expressed his views about Belaseshe. This year, his sarkar 3 is releasing the same day as Posto and I believe it will only bring good luck for me. Soumitra Chatterjee and Amitabh Bachchan are both icons of the Indian film industry. I'm hopeful that the audiences will give them equal love. Belaseshe did phenomenally well as did Piku. I hope, this year too, the statistics are quite the same. I wish him all the luck for Sarkar 3."
 
 We hope both the films rule the box office.
