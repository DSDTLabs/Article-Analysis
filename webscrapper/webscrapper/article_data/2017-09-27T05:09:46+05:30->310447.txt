ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani agent has accused his own intelligence agency of protecting terror groups in a petition in the   high court, and questioned the agency for not taking any action against suspected terrorists.

 Petitioner Malik Mukhtar Ahmed Shahzad, a sub-inspector in Pakistan's   ( ), filed a petition in the Islamabad high court, requesting for a thorough investigation against his seniors by the   (ISI), the country's premier intelligence body.
 
 “The issue of connivance, complacency and involvement of official of IB and other senior bureaucrats raised in the petition may graciously be entrusted to the ISI for investigation,“ the petitioner requested the court.
 
 Shahzad, who joined the IB in 2007, has alleged that the agency did not take any action against terror organisations with roots in Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and India despite concrete evidence against them.
 
 His petition names several Pakistan intelligence officials, including a joint director general, directors and deputy directors as conspirators in the matter. Shahzad added that the matter was even reported to the IB director general but no action was taken.
 
 While alleging that many of his seniors were on the payroll of foreign intelligence agencies to protect terrorists, Shahzad stated, “Upon thorough intelligence gathering process, it transpired that certain high officials of the IB themselves are directly involved with the terrorist organisations having linkages with hostile enemy intelligence agencies.“
 
 Shahzad added that he “has been running from pillar to post including approaching the prime minister to raise this issue of national security and protection of lives of the citizen of this country but in vain.“
 
 The petition states that some IB officials had travelled to Israel and had direct links with Afghan intelligence, which, it was found later, had links to another terrorist group from Kazakhstan. It adds that some senior IB officials also facilitate Afghan nationals in getting Pakistani nationality.
 
 “These terrorists used to disguise themselves as citrus dealers in Kot-Momin and Bhalwal, Sargodha, in Pakistan's Punjab province.The business was a mere camouflage,“ the petition said, adding that the son of joint director IB (Punjab) was dealing with the said terrorist groups.
