CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader   on Sunday asked if chief minister   and Congress MLAs will resign over the adverse   judgment on the   (SYL) canal issue.

 “Amarinder Singh and 46 Congress MLA’s had resigned to protest the Supreme Court decision on the SYL canal issue in November 2016. A similar crisis over SYL canal is likely to arise on Monday when the Supreme Court is expected to deliver an adverse judgment over this burning issue,” he asked.
 
 “It’s a matter of record, that the Supreme Court while deciding on the Presidential Reference last November had held the Termination of Water’s Agreement Act 2004, passed by the then Capt Amarinder Singh government Unconstitutional. The Hon’ble Supreme Court had directed construction of SYL canal at the earliest. All pleas of Punjab to first decide the   available had fallen on deaf ears,” he added.
