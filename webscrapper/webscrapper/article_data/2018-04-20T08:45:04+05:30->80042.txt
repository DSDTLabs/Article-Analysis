AJMER: Two criminal gangs fighting for supremacy in a jail may appear like a move script but it’s a reality in   where a murder convict killed his cellmate over a petty dispute on Thursday morning. 

 The murder behind the bars is most likely the fallout of a gang war going on inside the jail and the authorities are now thinking of shifting and reshuffling the prisoners.
 
 Criminals in the   are running gangs from inside. Earlier this month in an incident of firing on a property dealer of  , it was discovered that a mobile call for extortion came from the central jail. After investigations, the police arrested prisoner Ramswarop Gazani for threatening the property dealer.
 
 Sources said the criminals in the jail want to retain their influence in the locality with the help of gangs both inside and also outside the prison. 
 
 The gang leader is the one who has been convicted for a heinous crime. Controlling the barrack, jail and other prisoners contributes to his supremacy.
 
 “Mostly, these prisoners are sentenced for life and have found no relief in appeals. The only option left before them to have some vague pride and power is to run a gang inside the jail,” said a retired jail officer.
 
 When a new prisoner or undertrial comes to the jail, he is threatened and sometimes beaten by the members of the gangs to follow their terms and conditions. 
 
 On May 31, 2017, an undertrial   (29) of   committed suicide by hanging himself in the barrack number 11. After investigation, it came to light that the accused was a drug edict and therefore committed suicide. But sources said new inmates are harassed if they don’t join the gangs. 
 
 Murder of   inside the jail is also case of fights between rival gangs.
