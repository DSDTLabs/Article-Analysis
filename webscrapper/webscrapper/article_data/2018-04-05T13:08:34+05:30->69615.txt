Delhi’s alarming air pollution has been a highly debated topic that B-Town celebs have also been a part of. This time around, actors   and   chose to promote another pressing issue - road safety. 

 
 The ‘October’ actor along with ‘Pari’ star teamed up with the Delhi traffic police to raise awareness about road safety.
 
 The post was subsequently promoted by Varun Dhawan too. Ironically, Varun was previously caught by the   for not wearing his seatbelt to lean out of his car and take a selfie with his fan while halted at a traffic signal. 
 
 
  
 Subsequent to that, Mumbai Police tweeted to him that being a youth icon, he should be "responsible" and such acts were only permitted on the silver screen. The tweet exchange ended with the actor apologising and the police issuing him an E-challan. 
 
 
 Well, looks like Varun is making up for past mistakes.
