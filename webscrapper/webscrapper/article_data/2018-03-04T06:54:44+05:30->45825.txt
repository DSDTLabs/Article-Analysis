KOLKATA:   chairman Ashwani Lohani is satisfied with the construction of tunnels and the precautionary measures undertaken for the   corridor in Kolkata on Saturday. 

 Lohani entered the tunnel from Howrah Maidan and travelled nearly 200m beyond Mahakaran station inspecting the first tunnel boring machine at work.
 
 Metro Railway CPRO Indrani Banerjee said, "He inspected the tunnel under the Hooghly riverbed. No moisture was found there. He was also taken to the emergency evacuation and ventilation shaft near Strand Road. This shaft ends 19m below the riverbed and is the deepest one in the country."
 
 Lohani also inspected the Howrah station at a depth of 33m, which is one of the deepest such constructions in India. He then checked portions of the tunnel below the Brabourne Road flyover, the old buildings in Burrabazar and heritage structures like synagogues, churches and government offices. He was later briefed on the schedule of the project.
 
 The first phase of the E-W Metro corridor between Salt Lake's Sector-V and Salt Lake Stadium will be commissioned before Puja this year. Officials hope to commission the entire stretch from Howrah Maidan to Salt Lake Sector-V by the end of 2020. The project faced delays due to land hurdles and shifting of alignments. There were also delays in getting permissions from several agencies for use of land.
 
 "Construction is now progressing fast and we don't anticipate any further delay. In fact,   hopes to achieve more than last year," Banerjee said.
