The correlation between the weight and height of a person is an indication of a person’s health. This is called Body Mass Index (BMI). It has always been associated with the incidence of diabetes.   is often times dependent on race, genetics, eating habits etc. Many studies have compared BMI of different races and have found that as opposed to Caucasians most Asians are at higher risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. Strangely Asians develop   at a much lower BMI as compared to their European counterparts. What it really indicates is that despite lower prevalence of obesity Asians tend to be at greater risk and the current data supports this. It has been revealed that 60% of world’s diabetic population is resident in China and India. China is up against oncoming disaster called diabetes where it is predicted that 6 out of 10 Chinese people are either already diabetic or at least prediabetic. 

 
 In a recent study published in the journal, Clinical Interventions in Aging, it was observed that nearly 22% of the elderly in China were already diabetic. The study focused on the premise that Type 2 diabetes is usually accompanied by hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver and a much higher BMI. This inevitably always leads to increased mortality due to cardiovascular conditions. This increased BMI was studied as an indicator in a population of 479 seniors aged between 65-95 years who were hospitalized with recently diagnosed diabetes. This study compared them with a group of 183 prediabetics and 62 people without either of these conditions. BMI and the other associated conditions were found to be higher in diabetics as compared to the other 2 groups. This is a clear indicator of decreased insulin sensitivity as the BMI increases, which leads to other associated health issues. Needless to say these are difficult times for the Asian population.
