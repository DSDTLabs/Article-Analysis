PATNA: State energy department is holding camps in villages across   to ensure 100% household electrification before the December deadline this year under PM’s  .

 
 Officials said around 7,000 households have been provided   connections in the state through camps since March. “A survey is conducted using Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011 data to identify new and the existing consumers who need restoration of their connections. Those households that are not covered in SECC data will also be provided electricity connections under   Yojana,” said superintending engineer (electric supply circle, Patna) Dilip Kumar.
 
 “After a weeklong survey, three-day camps are set up in the villages to complete requisite documentation on-the-spot to expedite electricity connections free of cost. Our junior electrical engineers (JEEs) visit the households to monitor and supervise the work progress. The data of new consumers is uploaded to Saubhagya portal within 24 hours of the consumer registration,” he said.
 
 Kumar said transformers, meters and wires are also provided under the scheme and the entire process is done within two days. The first bill is generated after a cycle of 45 days. “We have engaged a company to collect first bill directly from the consumer’s house,” Kumar said. He said the connections are free for below poverty line (BPL) families. For above poverty line (APL) family in rural areas, a token money of Rs500 is charged.
 
 “Seven camps have been held since March and we have served first bills to around 3,000 of the 7,000 new consumers,” he added.
