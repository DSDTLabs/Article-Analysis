NEW DELHI: Two “businessmen” discussing multi-crore deals would enter a car showroom, inspect a sedan and signal a salesman to get it ready for a  . The salesman, anticipating an instant deal, won’t delay but once on road, the duo would either throw him off the car or ask him to get off on a pretext and flee with the car. They managed to steal at least 50 cars from across the country till the crime branch of Delhi Police laid a trap following a tipoff and arrested them.

 Five cars, including a Fortuner, Duster, Verna and a Bolero, have been recovered. The police are now looking for two associates and other stolen cars. The gang would steal SUVs and sedans and replace their registration and chasis/engine numbers with those of damaged cars bought as scrap. Refitted cars were mostly sold in Delhi. The arrested have been identified as Arif Husain from Moradabad and   from Raipur. They told cops that they used to buy the scrap from insurance companies that had settled the claim, allowing them to obtain the documents of damaged cars.
 
 Joint commissioner of police (crime)   said Husain, who had a business of auto spare parts, met Alisher, one of his accomplices, in 2011 and was lured into the crime. “Alisher himself was involved in several such cases in Maharashtra. Husain came in contact with Singh through Alisher and sent him to buy the car scrap along with their documents,” said Ranjan. 
 
 The men used to earn almost 80% profit through these sales, said an officer. Husain’s friend, Kamal, used to tamper with the original numbers, he added. After a case was registered in west Delhi, a team led by DCP Madhur Verma was formed to bust the racket. The accused were arrested on Tuesday after the police got a tipoff that Husain would come near a school in Dwarka Sector 16 to deliver a stolen Duster to his associate Singh.
