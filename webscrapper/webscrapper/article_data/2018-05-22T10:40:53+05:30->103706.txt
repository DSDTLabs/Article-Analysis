DHARWAD: Fed up with irregular and erratic   during peak summer, the residents of Dharwad staged a protest in front of the   (KUWS&DB) office here on Monday.

 The protesters led by former mayor and   leader   demanded that the authorities visit areas facing acute water shortage and take steps to streamline distribution of water.
 
 Shivu said major parts of the city are covered under the 24X7 drinking water supply sceme, but due to the negligence of officials, several wards are not getting regular and sufficient water. This apart, the water board is charging exorbitant water cess, he charged and demanded that it should be reduced, the former mayor added.
 
 “Some areas including Channabasaveshwar Nagar, Ulavi Channabasaveshwar Nagar and neighbouring areas coming under ward number 17 are facing severe drinking water crisis for the last few days. Though, the matter was brought to the notice of officials several times they did not respond,” he alleged.
 
 These areas are covered under continuous water supply, but officials are supplying water according to their whims and fancies. Keeping aside all their work, the residents are forced to stand in front of taps to get a pot of water, the residents charged.
 
 To add to the woes the water is released after midnight. Due to shortage of water, the residents are forced to pay huge sums to private water tankers. The new meters fixed to get water cess are faulty and more tax is being collected, alleged the residents. Shivu complained that officials were not receiving phone calls of corporators too.
 
 On getting information, KUWS&DB chief engineer   met the protesters and told them that the disruption in water supply was due to technical snags and things have been restored. He assured them that there will be hassle-free water supply henceforth.
 
 He also promised to conduct a meeting of assistant executive engineers and ensure that all the issues are sorted out.
