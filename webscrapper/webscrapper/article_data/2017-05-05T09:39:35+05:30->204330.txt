AHMEDABAD: After almost two and a half months of  , the   that had replaced calcium carbide pouches are now under scrutiny. 

 Samples have been sent to the food and drugs laboratory of the state government in Vadodara for conducting tests on the content of these ethylene sachets.
 
 Whether these ‘ethylene sachets’ are allowed under prevailing food laws was examined by a team of experts last week. 
 
 During Wednesday’s raids, the   ( ) officials seized a sizeable number of   fruit ripening sachets. 
 
 “The content of the sachets is unknown, and how these sachets are being sourced by fruit traders is also unknown,” said a senior AMC health official. “Ethylene treatment requires proper chambers where ethylene gas is released in a controlled setting. The content of the present Chinese sachets is not known, so we have seized them,” he added.
