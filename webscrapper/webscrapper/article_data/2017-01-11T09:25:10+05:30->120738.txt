NAGPUR: The world of wild animals was brought alive through a display of magnificent photographs at Rangayan Gallery, Chitnavis Centre, on Tuesday evening. Srushti Paryavaran Mandal showcased 78 curated photographs from over 700 entries it received for its national level wildlife photography competition held in memory of wildlife activist Raju Harkare. G Mallikarjuna, deputy conservator of forest, Nagpur, inaugurated the exhibition, which will continue till January 12, from 12.30pm to 8.00pm.

 An Indian leopard feasting on a kill, two black bucks locking horns, an elephant in a dust storm, a sloth bear peaking from behind a tree — each photograph brought moments from the world of wildlife unbelievably close to one’s eyes; some of them rare species. Three entries were chosen for prizes and another three received special mention. Pratik Pradhan, a Mumbaikar, won the first prize of Rs25,000 for his photo of a heterometrus scorpion. The second prize of Rs15,000 went to another Mumbaikar Sarang Naik for capturing seagulls in slow shutter. Sourav Mondal from Kolkata won the third prize of Rs10,000 for the photo of a red panda in eastern Himalayan habitat in pre-winter. 135 participants across India participated in the competition this year.
 
 The photographs were judged by   and photographer Prasenjit Yadav. Relative placement of different elements in an image and how they complement each other, lighting, creativity, and story were taken into consideration while choosing the winning images, said Yadav through a written post at the venue. Raju Harkare, in whose memory the exhibition was organized, was a rescuer of wild animals, says Srushti member and green activist Swanand Soni. “He was a proactive animal lover, whose style and angle helped in conservation of animals. He had equal love for all animals,” added Soni.
