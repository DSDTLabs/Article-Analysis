Amritsar: Punjab-based industry body Indo-Foreign Chamber of Commerce (IFCC) said on Saturday that duty-free trade over the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir had overshadowed business carried out between the two countries through the Integrated Check Post (ICP) in Attari near here. 

 IFCC president B K Bajaj said though the Centre had allowed traders to barter only 21 items between Kashmir and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, almost everything, including products of South India, was being traded in the name of barter. “Indian government should unilaterally close the barter trade,” Bajaj said.
 
 Duty-free, cross-border trade between the two parts of Kashmir was started on October 21, 2008, through Slamabad (India)-Chakothi (Pakistan) and Chakan Da Bagh (India)-Rawalkot (Pakistan) routes. It is not governed by any foreign trade policy. The Customs Act, 1962, is also not applicable on it.
 
 When contacted, commissioner of customs (preventive) Dipak Kumar Gupta said barter between the two Kashmirs had not affected traed at Attari in anyway. “We allow exchange of only prescribed goods; this does not involves imports and exports as money does not change hands,” he said.
 
 Bajaj disagreed. He cited an alleged drug-smuggling racket busted in 2017. In that case, an Amritsar-based trader was accused of getting heroin smuggled through the Kashmir route. The Indian trader would export items to Pakistan through the barter route and his businessman in Pakistan would pay for the heroin to Pakisyan-based smuggler, who would then sneak in the contraband into India. 
 
 The Indian smuggler who would receive the drugs would then pay the Amritsar trader, it was alleged. “This is nothing less than legalized smuggling,” said Bajaj.
 
 There is a also a risk involvement for the customs staff in Kashmir as they often come under shelling from the across the border. “We have four to five staff members who are forced to hide in bunkers in such a scenario,” said commissioner Gupta.
