Life OK is all set to herald a dramatic change in Indian television with 'Prem Ya Paheli Chandrakanta'. A fantasy love story, it is based on a novel by  . While public perception is that the story is the love tale of a beautiful princess, there’s much more to it. The show, starring Kritika Kamra and   as Princess   and Warrior Prince   respectively, will bring alive the entire magical story. 
The story of the duo stretches over generations and shows how they conquer the tilismic world with their destiny and power. Unlike the earlier version (on Doordarshan), the show will begin with a prelude of 100 years. 
 
 A lot of work has gone into the show, with research taking up almost two years. Be it multi-locale shoots across India, grand palatial sets or gory battleground scenes enhanced by VFX experts from Hollywood, it promises to be a never-seen-before visual treat to the viewers. That’s not all, the lead pair was asked to follow a strict diet and exercise regimen for six months before the shoot started. Kritika’s royal avatar has already generated a lot of buzz. 
 
 Director-producer Nikhil Sinha, known for shows like 'Siya ke Ram', 'Devon ke Dev…Mahadev and Hatim', says, “Everybody has seen 'Chandrakanta', but nobody knows the origin of it. I’m fortunate to introduce the prologue of this story by introducing it from Prince Virendra’s perspective.”
