AHMEDABAD: A   from a Banasknatha village has been given   for a   after receiving threat calls for using 'Sinh' in the names of the groom's nephews on wedding invitation. 

 An FIR was lodged by Deesa police after the head of the family, Kanji Bhadru, who is a cop himself with Deesa town police station, started receiving threat calls from members of Darbar community objecting to use of the surname generally used by Darbars or Rajputs.
 
 P S Chaudhary, deputy superintendent of police (DSP) of Deodar taluka in Banaskantha, said that two accused - both from Darbar community, have been arrested and sent to judicial custody in Palanpur jail.
 
 "We have arrested Bhupatsinh Piraji Rajput and Sarangsinh Malabhai Rajput, resident of Suigam in Banaskantha, on Wednesday evening in connection with the complaint lodged by Kanji Bhadru," said Chaudhary. "Bhadru had received about 50 calls threatening him of dire consequences after he used the 'Sinh' surname in the invitation card of his younger brother's wedding."
 
 Bhadru had printed the names of his nephews as 'Uttamsinh' and 'Azadsinh' in the tahuko (the invitation by children in a wedding card) section, which the Darbars objected to.
 
 A native of Golagam village in Vav taluka of Banaskantha, Bhadru said that he had sought police protection for his younger brother Hitesh's wedding for the pre-marriage feast on May 11, and also for the wedding procession on May 12. 
 
 Chaudhary said that the family has been provided five armed policemen who will be deployed at Bhadru's house round the clock. Sources said one police Inspector and two police sub-inspectors will be patrolling in the village until the wedding is concluded.
