PUNE: Sudhir  , the minister of finance and planning as well as forests department, said filling up of vacant posts across the government departments in the state will not put a dent on the state exchequer.

 Mungantiwar said the revenue target for the state was Rs 92,000 crore, but the state managed Rs 1,20,000 crore. “We have a surplus of Rs 28,000 crore and the necessary funds have been allocated for these posts,” said the minister, who was in the city to take a stock of the tree plantation drive to be undertaken in July.
 
 In a decision, that can be termed as an “election-year decision,” the state cabinet on Wednesday decided to fill up 36,000 vacant posts across 10 departments. During the budget session of the state assembly, chief minister   had said that 76,000 vacant posts would be filled up on the priority basis. Accordingly, the government decided to fill up 36,000 posts this year while the remaining 36,000 posts would be filled up next year. As many as 11,005 posts in rural development; 10,568 posts in public health; 7,111 in home; 2,572 in agriculture; and 1,664 posts in urban development departments, along with another 1,300 posts in four other departments would be filled up this year.
 
 Addressing the tree plantation drive, the minister said the state aims to plant for 13 crore sapling in July. Of this target, Pune division will get 1.95 crore saplings.
 
 
 
 The finance minister also called for an inquiry into furniture works at the   building without the government having allocated funds for them. Though the works were cleared in the budgetary allocation, the tender-floating and the contractor-appointment processes can only take place after the funds have been disbursed. The minister sought answers from the PWD.
