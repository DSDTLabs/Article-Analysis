When the victim’s minor brother tried to intervene, they assaulted him, Dalvi said. Then, when shack owners tried to intervene, the tourists created a ruckus and fled the scene. 
 
 The incident occured when the brother and sister were playing on the beach. Their parents were sitting in a nearby shack. The father then lodged a complaint witht the police, following which two of the assailants were nabbed. Dalvi said that the rest of the group was arrested later, adding that two of the assailant were minors.

 While the juveniles have been lodged at Apna Ghar, the other nine are in police custody. All of them are from the Dhakanwadi area of Pune. Police have also attached the mobile phone used to take photos of the girl.
