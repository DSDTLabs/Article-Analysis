BICHOLIM: The second day of the Lairai zatra at   on Saturday saw nearly one lakh   walking on a bed of embers, or the homkhan, while performing the ritual of ‘agnidivya’. Dhonds are devotees who adhere strictly to various rites and rituals of the festival, are vegetarian and follow abstinence for five days before the zatra.

 Goddess Lairai, believed to be an incarnation of goddess Parvati, is the most popular deity in Goa and the Konkan region. She is even revered among Goan Catholics as   (mother of God).
 
 Twenty-two Chowgule manakaris — believed to be close devotees of goddess — followed the dhonds through the bed of fire, while the male priest of the temple was the last to walk through it, bearing a kalash on his head, thus marking the end of the first phase of the zatra.
 
 Friday, the first day of the zatra, saw the performance of several rituals like sprinkling holy water in the village; dances by the dhonds in the temple and around the homkhan; bringing and placing firewood of vows by devotees; worship of the kalash believed to contain the soul of the goddess; processions to Mudder — the goddesses’ native place; and the arrival of the holy kalash at the homkhan. Following this, the homkhan was prepared for Saturday’s ceremony by placing burning sticks in it — a ritual that continued late into the night.
 
 On Saturday, the priest, accompanied by the dhonds and the 22 Chowgule mankaris, took a dip in the holy ‘Dhondhachi Tali’ (lake meant for the ‘dhonds). Thereafter, the priest blessed the dhonds who then proceeded to walk on the embers. The air echoed with chants praising the goddess as the first phase of zatra came to a close with the ‘agnidivya’ ritual. The second phase of the festival commenced on Saturday evening and will continue till Tuesday.
