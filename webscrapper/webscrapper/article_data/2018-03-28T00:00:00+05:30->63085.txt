Over 35 students, activists and supporters from the city gathered at Town Hall on Monday to protest   on campuses, as they raised slogans and shared their own experiences. Organised by The Students Outpost (TSO) — a group formed by students from various colleges in the city to address issues against sexual harassment — the   saw several students speak up about sexual harassment incidents that have taken place in their colleges.

 Shalom Gauri, a student and member of the TSO, says, “There are a lot of colleges in the city that do not have any system in place through which students can put forth their concerns to the   management. It is mostly on paper. And even if they have a system or a committee in place, they don’t have a student representative. Most of the colleges that have a student’s council are there only to organise fests and other events.”
 
 By organising a protest like this, the group aims to gauge the attention of the authorities. “One of our goals was to make some noise about the issue itself. We met many students, who we didn’t know before, who have experienced sexual harassment, but had never spoken up. A protest like this will make the authorities sit up and take notice; it puts pressure on them,” says Shalom.
 
 How can educational institutions make students safe on campus? “Students, faculty members and the non-teaching staff need to be sensitised about these issues. Having an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), along with a student representative will also help. In addition to this, they can also have more discussions about such incidents and try to not hush it up,” says Shalom, adding, “It would be nice to have female security guards on   as well.” According to the group, which has been active since June 2017, participation from students has gone up and they hope to reach out to students from more colleges in the near future.
