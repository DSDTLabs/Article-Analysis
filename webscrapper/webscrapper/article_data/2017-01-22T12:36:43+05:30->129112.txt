Actress   says the 'Guardians of the  ' sequel will be even better than the first movie. 

  
  
 The 29-year-old actress, who is reprising her role as   in the follow-up to the   superhero film, said she can not wait for fans to learn more about her character. 
 
 "I'm so excited for people to see it! I just feel like it's all of the best elements of the first one, just amplified. It's even better - it's funnier, the music's even better ... the second album is a blinder. It's great."
 "And in the first one everyone was being established. Now that that's out of the way, you really get to delve into all of their dilemmas and things like that. I think family would really be the main theme of the thing. And my character Nebula is dealing with a whole lot of stuff there - we see a whole new side to her," Gillan said.
