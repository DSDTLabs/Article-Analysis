HYDERABAD: New   continue to be elusive at banks and ATMs across the city even as Sankranti approaches. Citizens and traders in the city have been suffering because of the lack of smaller denomination notes while banks remain clueless about supply. “Last week there was a good supply of Rs 500 and Rs 100 notes, but now we are running short,” a manager of a public sector bank said.

 The supply dipped after salary week, during which time more Rs 500 notes were dispensed through ATMs. With ATMs dispensing Rs 2,000 notes, festive shopping has become difficult.
 
 “When I went to withdraw cash in a ATM, I saw a barrage of Rs 2,000 notes,” S Bhavana Chakarvarty of Kachiguda said. In several places, though banks were giving cash of Rs 24,000, but this was in Rs 2,000 notes. According to RBI sources, the shortage is because of ‘slowdown’ at the Mysore press, which supplies currency. “Once the Mysore press enhances supply, the position will improve,” said an official. tnn
