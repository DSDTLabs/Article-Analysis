NEW DELHI: The Centre on Thursday notified the appointment of senior advocates Vikramjit Banerjee, Aman Lekhi and   as additional solicitors general for the Supreme Court, more than eight months after the positions became vacant. 

 With the new appointments, the strength of ASGs in the SC has gone up to eight. The terms of serving ASGs — Maninder Singh, Tushar Mehta, P S Narasimha, Atmaram Nadkarni and Pinky Anand — have been extended till June 2020. The vacancies arose after the appointment of L Nageswara Rao as an SC judge in May 2016 and the resignation of Neeraj Kishan Kaul and S S Patwalia in June 2017. 
 
 The   on Appointments also decided to appoint senior advocate   as ASG for Delhi HC to fill the vacancy arising from Sanjay Jain’s resignation. 
 
 Banerjee, who has authored a book on fundamental rights and contributed an article ‘Dharma, Religion and Law’ in Oxford University’s ‘Encyclopedia of Laws and Religions’, had been practising law for two decades and was the main assisting counsel to senior advocate Ravi Shankar Prasad in the Ayodhya land dispute case before the Allahabad HC. 
 
 The HC had divided the disputed land equally between deity Ram Lalla, Sunni   and Niromohi Akhara. Banerjee was appointed advocate general of Nagaland in June 2015. 
 
 Aman Lekhi, senior advocate and BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi’s husband, has followed in his father P N Lekhi’s footsteps and established himself as a successful criminal law practitioner. Sandeep Sethi, one of the leading advocates of Delhi HC, was a batchmate of Lekhi in Delhi University. 
 
 Both graduated from CLC in 1989 and were designated senior advocate a year apart in 2004 and 2005 respectively. However, the government appears undecided about appointing a lawyer to the post of solicitor general of India, which has been vacant for more than four months since the resignation of senior advocate Ranjit Kumar on October 20.
