LUCKNOW: Amid controversy over the ban on   houses in UP, the state government has decided that it will not run abattoirs.

 UP urban development minister   told TOI on Saturday that the state government is not in favour of running abattoirs. Khanna, however, clarified that the decision was not influenced by the BJP's ideology but based on past experiences of public sector being in commercial activity.
 
 “Past experience indicates that governments carrying out commercial activities have not been very successful. So, we did not feel in spired to open slaughter houses to incur losses further. Rather, the government would prefer encouraging private players to set up abattoirs,“ said Khanna.
 
 “Government will grant no objection certificates to any private player that fulfils the mandatory formalities.Along with this, the government will improve efficiency in the existing abattoirs in the public sector,“ said Khanna. The existence of slaugh ter houses, legal and illegal, and increasing meat export from UP, were major issues in the BJP's campaign for the 2017 assembly elections. The party , in its manifesto, had committed that it would shut all slaughter houses in the state if it was voted to power.
 
 As soon as the formed the government in March, a ban was clamped on slaughter houses, raising a national furore and huge loss of exports and also the order threatened the dairy business in the state. Later on, the government clarified that only illegal slaughter houses would be banned and the government would run its abattoirs. These were, however, insufficient in view of growing demand for meat in the domestic market as well as export demands. UP is the largest meat exporter in the country and India turned world's top meat exporter long back, beating Brazil.
