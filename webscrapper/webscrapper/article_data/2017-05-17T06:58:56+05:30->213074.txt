MUMBAI:   chairman V K Sharma has defended the instituion's investment in the   ( ), and said that the opposition to  's investment is not a war between `smoking and non-smoking' as it is made out to be.

 "We have an obligation to protect our capital and the organisation which is a national institution," said Sharma responding to a question on the ongoing case in the Bombay HC challenging LIC's 16% investment in ITC.
 
 "If we exit this highly productive investment, somebody will snap it up. So it is not a war between smokers and non-smokers or health versus disease. It is a commercial decision and so far this has made immense commercial sense. Also, ITC has diversified and today only 45% of its revenue comes from tobaccos, which some years back was 90% or more," he said.
 
 Sharma said that LIC being a long-term investor, with its Rs 23-lakh-crore portfolio, had a contrarian approach to investing. "In FY17 we invested Rs 40,000 crore in markets and also booked profits of Rs 19,000 crore," said Sharma.
 
 This is 72% more than the Rs 11,000 crore of equity profits booked in FY16, when it had invested Rs 50,000 crore in equity markets. The recent sensex rally has helped it book 19% more profit in the March quarter alone. During the April-December period of 2016, it had netted Rs 16,000 crore in profit.
 
 When asked about LIC's view on the   deal, Sharma said the corporation fully supports the deal.However, the  ' need to rework the deal structure to protect LIC's investment terms or repay the around Rs 2,300-crore loan.
