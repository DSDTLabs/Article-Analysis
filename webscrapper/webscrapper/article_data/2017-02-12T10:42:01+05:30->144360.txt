AURANGABAD: Members of   (ABVP) clashed with members of   (BKMM) after the latter tried disrupting an event held on premises of   (BAMU) to mark the death anniversary of Deendayal Upadhyay.

 University-based National Service Scheme (NSS) along with members of Earn and Learn scheme on Saturday organised a lecture ‘Deendayal Upadhyay Yancha Ekatma Manav Darsha’ at the Mahatma Phule hall.
 
 Soon after the lecture started, several members of the BKMM reached the auditorium and raised objections over conduction of the lecture. They disrupted the lecture citing that though the hall — where the event was going on — has been named after Mahatma Phule, but his death anniversary was never celebrated. The youths also shouted slogans against right wing organisations.
 
 Morcha’s attempt to disrupt the on-going lecture did not go down well with the ABVP members who passed on the message to their BJP counterparts.
 
 Meanwhile, varsity vice-chancellor Balu Ananda Chopde intervened and summoned the agitating youths at the management council hall to discuss the objections raised by them.
 
 In no time, ABVP members along with the BJP workers barged into the hall by breaking the glass panels on the entrance door and assaulted BKMM members. On realising the situation is going out of hand, the authorities brought the matter to the notice of the police and a team from Begumpura police station rushed to the spot.
 
 The police on Saturday evening confirmed receiving couple of complaints, including the one from the varsity’s chief security officer.
 
 Police sub inspector Rajendra Bangar said, “We have received two complaints including the one from the security officer. The other complaint is from one Sachin Shinde, belonging to the BKMM. The action on the complaints would be taken only after going through the   footages.”
 
 The officer added that in couple of days the entire picture would become clear and the police would zero down on the miscreants.
