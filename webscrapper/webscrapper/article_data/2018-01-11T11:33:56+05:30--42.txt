PUNE: Frustrated over the harassment by her estranged friend, a 15-year-old girl from Aundh ended her life by hanging herself from the ceiling of her house on Tuesday afternoon. 

 The victim's friend, a 20-year-old youth from the same locality, was arrested under the charges of 354 (D) [stalking], 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
 
 Sub-inspector Kiran   of the Chatushrungi police said that the girl, a school dropout, was in a relationship with the youth earlier. However she had stopped talking with him since the past five months. "The girl's mother, who lodged the complaint against the youth, claimed that the latter used to harass her daughter regularly. He used to call her or try to meet her frequently," Madane said. 
 
 The sub-inspector said the girl was under stress following the harassment. 
 
 "On Tuesday afternoon she was alone in the house and hung herself from the ceiling with her 'dupatta'," Madane said.
