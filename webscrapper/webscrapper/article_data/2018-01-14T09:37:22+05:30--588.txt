LUCKNOW: As India gets ready for business at the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand, three UP players – Shivam Mavi, Shiva Singh and   —will also seek glory in order to enliven the Indian challenge. India play their opening match against Australia at  ,   on Sunday.

 Shivam, the Noida born all-rounder is a right-arm fast medium bowler who can use the long-handle well with the willow. The player, who was a regular for India under-19 against England will hope to do well in conditions where the ball is likely to seam and swing more.
  
  
 During the England tour last summer, he came up with an attractive unbeaten 86 at Worcester in the Test, and also bagged four wickets. In the next game at Chesterfield he was again in the news scoring 41 not out and claiming six wickets with a haul of 4/51 in the first innings. At 16 years, wicketkeeper batsman Aryan is one of the babies of the side.
 
 
 
 
 The Moradabad lad, who grabbed the opportunity when provided a chance against South   scoring a stylish 86 during a practice match in New Zealand, will believe that the team management shows faith in him and provides him chance during the tournament. Aryan’s father, Dr Sanjay Juyal is a physician who practices in  , but Aryan has played all his agegroup Board matches for UP.
 
 Another Moradabad player Shiva will be in fray with his left-arm spin. The 18-year-old boy, who also did India duty during the under-19 Asia Cup and the away series against England in August last year will find the conditions not very suitable for his type of bowling in New Zealand. Still he came up with a creditable show of 2/9 in the practice game against South Africa.
 
 With the senior Ranji Trophy squad not performing well for the past couple of years, these youngsters are likely to provide the state team a new steam next season thanks to their experience of playing against and watching the best in New Zealand.
