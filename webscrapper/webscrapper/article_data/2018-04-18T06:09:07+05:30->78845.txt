THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   in the   will now think twice before staging a strike. The indefinite  , which was called off on the fourth day, has made the doctors do an introspection.

 A day after the strike ended after receiving a severe bashing from the state government, the leadership of Kerala Government Officers’ Association (KGMOA) is facing flak from its district units. At least half a dozen district units of   have questioned the state leadership on what they had achieved with the strike.
 
 A unanimous resolution passed by the district committee strongly condemned “the untimely and extemporary decision of the state leadership to go into a strike without proper consultations with senior leaders and the immature handling of the whole strike process”.
 
 “The state leadership showed its immaturity. The strike call was not acceptable for many of us,” said a former office bearer of KGMOA .
 
 The association lost its face after the strike, as the government refused to withdraw the disciplinary action taken against the doctors in Palakkad. The government had demanded written apologies from the doctors for their act. This itself proved the fact that the strike was a setback, said a district office-bearer of the association.
 
 Most of the district committees have viewed that the entire state committee was responsible for the pathetic situation and demanded the resignation of state office bearers taking the responsibility of ‘failure of the strike’.
 
 The indefinite strike was called off on the fourth day on Monday, after a three-hour discussion held with health minister  . The minister agreed to meet representatives of KGMOA only after they submitted in writing that they had no objection against the proposed changes in duty pattern to be made as part of implementing Ardram Mission.
