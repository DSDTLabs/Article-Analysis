DEHRADUN: The district administration is going to start auction for sand mining in Rispana, Bindal, Nalapani, Kunduwala and   rivers from May 28 in Dehradun district.
 
  In a meeting chaired by additional district magistrate Arvind   on Thursday, river mining training was given to 40 bidders present at the meeting for the first time.
  
  Dehradun district magistrate SA Murugesan said, “If river bed material accumulates to the extent where it poses a threat to the structures and human habitation in the surrounding then the district magistrate has been empowered to order for the extraction of the material to ensure protection of people and property under the Disaster Management Act.”
  
  He said that last year mining was not allowed in these local rivers so a lot of river bed material has deposited which needs to be extracted.
  
  Pandey said, “The bidders were given sand river mining training whereby they were informed about the scientific manner in which they have to conduct the extraction activity. They were also briefed about other norms and regulations regarding collection, transportation and storage of the material.”
