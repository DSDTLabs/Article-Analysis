Hyderabad: City-based drug giant Dr Reddy’s Laboratories on Friday said there are no claims against the company for monetary damages as a result of the unfavourable ruling by a US court in a patent infringement case over a generic version of Swiss pharma player Helsinn Healthcare’s anti-nausea drug Aloxi (Palonosetron Hydrochloride). “We would like to state that there are no claims against the company for monetary damages because the proposed Palonosetron product has not been marketed,” DRL said in a filing to the BSE.

 “As for ‘quantum of claims’, the claims only sought injunctive relief against the company to prohibit the manufacturing, use, import and sale of the company's Palonosetron product prior to expiration of the patents-in-suit. Therefore, the company believes there is no monetary ‘compensation’ or ‘penalty’ damages owed to Helsinn due to this decision,” DRL added. On Thursday DRL had informed the bourses that it had received an unfavourable ruling in a US court in a patent infringement case over launching of a generic version of Aloxi in the US market. Aloxi injection is used to treat adults and help prevent nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy.
 
 In its intimation to the bourses on Thursday, DRL had said: “The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey issued its opinion regarding Helsinn Healthcare's patent infringement claims against Dr Reddy's proposed palonosetron product. The court found that Dr Reddy's s Laboratories proposed palonosetron hydrochloride 0.25 mg/5 ml infringes certain claims of US patents...and that the asserted claims were not invalid,” it added. 
 
 DRL had said it was “disappointed in the decision” and intends to “pursue an appeal in due course”.
