CHANDIGARH: The development plan of   for a projected population of over 39.55 lakh up to 2031, notified by the   government, not only provides all facilities that go in the name of sustainable urban living but also guards against certain pitfalls. 

 Be it density of population per hectare, connectivity by roads or  , power supply, traffic management, basic facilities or civic amenities, the plan tends to look forward to find a solution to any problem that may arise in near future.
 
 Giving details of the extension of the proposals, an official spokesman said on Sunday that the plan contained proposals for urbanization from Delhi border in the north to the foothills of the Aravalis in the west and beyond Gurgaon-Agra canal in the east and up to the revenue estate of   village in south. Since this town cannot be expanded towards north due to the constraint of Haryana-Delhi border, the additional area beyond east of Agra canal, south and south-west of the town had been proposed for the development of additional area to accommodate additional population, he added.
 
 The Final Development Plan-2031 has been proposed, keeping in view the overall town density of 115 persons per hectare, to accommodate 39.55 lakh persons within an area of 34,368 hectares by 2031. An area of 14,558 hectares has been proposed for residential purposes on the basis of average residential density of 271 persons per hectare (PPH). Every residential sector will be developed according to sector density indicated in the drawing with 20% variation on either side, and in addition to it the density as prescribed in the new integrated licensing, affordable group housing and transit oriented development policies.
 
 Three sectors 119, 143 and 146 adjoining the proposed industrial sectors have been proposed with a density of 600 PPH, wherein only group housing projects will be permitted. Eight pockets of 25 hectares each have also been reserved for high density development of 1,125 PPH in Sectors 99, 112, 119, 122, 139, 143, 146 and 156, paving the way for construction of smaller flats and for providing housing to low and medium income group.
 
 The spokesman said the decision regarding increase in sector density had been incorporated in the plan with three provisions. These are - additional area for infrastructure should be provided in the already planned or developed residential sectors to meet the requirement of additional population, minimum width of the roads in a residential colony or sector should not be less than 12m and minimum area for parks or open spaces in a residential colony or sector should be planned in such a manner that it should meet the minimum norm of 2.5sq m per person. 
 
 An area of 2,078 hectares has been proposed for commercial purposes. In addition, Sectors 100, 120 and 154 have been proposed as city centre.
