NAVI MUMBAI: Corporators cutting across party lines on Tuesday hit out at   for its   drives, disrupting the   meeting.

 There was no time left to discuss the revised   presented by the standing committee chairman. 
 
 Most members, including the mayor, accused civic chief Tukaram Mundhe for submitting a compliance report on illegal constructions in the high court, opposing the state cabinet’s latest draft policy of regularizing illegal structures in the city. The administration was also criticized for not amending the development control regulation while the state was ready to do so.
 
 “How can the commissioner write to the HC against the state policy,” asked mayor Sudhakar Sonawane. Sena corporator M K Madhvi said they would meet the chief minister and apprise him of “civic chief’s autocratic style”.
 
 Additional civic commissioner Ankush Chavan said the civic body was ready to regularize some structures, if possible, under the MRTP Act. The government can amend the existing act, Chavan said.
