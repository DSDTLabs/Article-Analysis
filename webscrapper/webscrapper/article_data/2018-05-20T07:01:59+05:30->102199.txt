HYDERABAD: After a poor show for two years, Telangana students bounced back this time around and walked away with eight of the top 10 ranks in the medical stream (agriculture and pharmacy) and seven top ranks in the engineering stream, in the Telangana State Engineering, Agriculture & Medical Common Entrance Test (TS EAMCET 2018), results of which were released on Saturday. In 2017, six of the top 10 ranks in engineering and five in medical stream were bagged by AP students.

 
 Hyderabad boy, Ayyapu Venkata Phani Vamsinath, secured the first rank in engineering, with a combined score of 95.72 and 150.87 marks in Eamcet and   from Kurnool topped the charts in agriculture and pharmacy (AM stream) with 93.38 marks and 145.88 Eamcet marks.
 
 “As the AP Eamcet results were released even before we conducted the  , a lot of students from the neighbouring state gave our test a miss. While the attendance percentage among candidates from Telangana was 94.25 and 92.29 for engineering and AM respectively, the percentage attendance of AP candidates in Eamcet was only 86.08 and 79.76 (in engineering and AM). This might be a reason why more number of students from Telangana made it to the toppers list,” said N Yadaiah, convener, TS Eamcet 2018.

Unlike other years, when the new academic session commences only in August, this time we want to start classes in June,” said Srihari.
