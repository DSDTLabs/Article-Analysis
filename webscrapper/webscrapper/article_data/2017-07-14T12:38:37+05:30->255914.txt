A fringe Tamil youth outfit has filed a police complaint seeking action against   contest   for allegedly using abusive language against people living in slums in the TV reality show Bigg Boss Tami. Tamil Youth and Students Federation said actress Gayathri Raghuram had allegedly chided another participant,   using the abusive term. Such abusive language allegedly insulted and belittled slum dwellers, said the complaint filed a day after a Hindu outfit sought a ban on the show, alleging it denigrated Tamil culture.

 Coordinator of the outfit S Guhan wanted action against the actress under laws including Protection of Civil Rights Act. "We want Vijay TV to publicly apologise for it," he told PTI. Yesterday, Hindu Makkal Katchi (HMK) sought legal action against  , hosting the show, and the actors participating in the show that is being telecast on Vijay TV since June 24. 
 
 Reacting to the complaint, Haasan had said "I have faith in law... if they want to arrest me, let it happen, law and justice will protect me." The actor, recalling movies of top Tamil film directors of yesteryear like K Balachander who dealt with family issues in their movies, said the reality show was just like that and it was about "co-existence."
