 is stunning and we all know it but her sheer energy is what makes her even more beautiful. The 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage' hottie graced the   cover for the first issue of the year and killed it with her charm and poise. The leggy lass looks drop-dead-gorgeous on the cover sporting a denim jacket and sneakers. 

 In a behind-the-scenes video, Deepika can be seen in high spirits as she poses with utmost perfection for the lens. The lady is giggling and joking around and having a blast while striking delicate poses and making the best of it. Have a look.
