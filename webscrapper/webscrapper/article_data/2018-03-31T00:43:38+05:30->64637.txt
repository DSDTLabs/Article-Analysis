New Delhi: From passengers wanting to use knives to cut fruits during their plane journey to spurious power banks that have been made heavy by clay — Central Industrial Security Force ( ) comes across flyers on a daily basis who are unaware of what can’t be carried in the hand and check-in baggage. 

 The problem gets compounded, said officials, when passengers argue about items like inflammable liquids and even   and claim they pose no threat. The onus of informing the passengers about the prohibited items primarily lies with the airlines, they pointed out. 
 
 While power banks are allowed in hand baggage, CISF said their task was made trickier when these were put in check-in baggage after making them heavier using clay. “We saw a lot of such cases last year. However, the number has gone down this year, though we still see some power banks like that,” said a senior CISF official. 
 
 Officials said they helped passengers with any enquiry about such items, but focus only on hand baggage for which instructions are available with the airlines. “We have observed that in most cases, passengers don’t check instructions on what can be carried in the check-in and hand baggage. While most frequent flyers are aware, first-timers often carry restricted items and we have to seize them,” said a senior CISF official.
 
 Among the most common prohibited items found in handbags are lighters,  ,   and even toy guns. In some cases, passengers have even tried taking kitchen knives, an official said. “They carry fresh fruits and say they need the knife to cut them during the flight. CISF personnel are often stationed before the checking points and keep informing passengers what items should not be there in their bags,” said the official.
 
 Last year, CISF had done away with stamping of domestic handbags at a number of major airports, including Delhi, to reduce the queue-up time for passengers while maintaining high-security levels by using precision HD cameras.
