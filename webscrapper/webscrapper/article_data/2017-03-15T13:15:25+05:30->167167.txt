NEW DELHI: A chartered aircraft carrying BJP president   and Union minister   to Imphal on Wednesday suffered an engine problem mid-air, prompting the pilot to return to the airport here.

 Following the engine snag, the two BJP leaders shelved their plans to travel to Imphal for the swearing-in ceremony of   as Manipur chief minister, sources here said.
 
 Naidu along with Shah and BJP leader Ram Lal had left for Imphal at 9.39am from the Indira Gandhi International Airport. The special chartered aircraft was carrying three more passengers besides the BJP leaders.
 
 After taking off, the 'Falcon 200' business jet of AR Airways developed some problem in its engine prompting the pilot to return to the airport here at 10.17am, airport sources said.
 
 Singh is scheduled to take oath as the new chief minister of Manipur on Wednesday.
 
 Governor   had on Tuesday invited Singh, who was unanimously elected the leader of the 21-member BJP legislature party, to form the government.
 
 The invitation to Singh came after four members of the Naga People's Front, an NDA ally, met the governor and declared their support to BJP for government formation.
