MUMBAI: An unidentified torso remains unclaimed at the mortuary of Cooper Hospital. Doctors said only a DNA examination would tell if it belongs to the   executive or the pilot who are missing or to those who are believed to have been found after the   helicopter crash.

 On Sunday, the remains of five deceased, including that of one of the two pilots, Capt Ramesh Othakar (47), were handed over to the families. The Pune resident’s body was identified with the help of a mole on his body. The second pilot (yet to be found) was Capt V Katoch.
 
 Ateam of three forensic experts, Dr R Sukhadev, Dr S Sonawane and Dr  , carried out the autopsies. The cause of death was found to be similar for all: shock and hemorrhage due to multiple lacerations and fractures. Two of the deceased, including ONGC’s Pankaj Garg, had some scarring. A forensic expert said, “None had classic burn injury, but two had scarring or moist burns, which happens if something hot is poured on the skin.” Experts said the absence of burn injuries could point to the possibility that the helicopter didn’t catch fire mid-air. Skin samples have been collected to detect the inflammable substance that may have caused the moist burns.
 
 As bodies arrived at hospitals, staff clicked photographs on cellphones and showed to relatives to help with identification. “We have collected blood and tissue samples (from all) in case there are any disputes in the future,” a doctor said.
