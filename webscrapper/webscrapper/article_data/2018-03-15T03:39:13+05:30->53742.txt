GURUGRAM: After a delay of more than two months, Gurugram   ( ) has finally set the ball rolling for the much-awaited city bus service.

 The technical   process was opened on Wednesday, in which four bidders participated. The GMDA is running against time as chief minister   had announced that the bus service would be launched on August 15 in the city.
 
 A bus service for Gurugram has been in the works for over a decade now, but has been stuck on the drawing board. Things started moving in the right direction only after GMDA was formed last year. The technical bid was supposed to be opened in December 2017 but shelved after bus manufacturers said they would not be able to provide air-conditioned buses within the timeframe set by the government. 
 
 The authorities had earlier planned to roll out a fleet of 500 buses — 200 air-conditioned and 300   — by April 2018. However, they had to rework the tender document after bus makers expressed their inability to manufacture air conditioned buses within the deadline. According to the latest plan, the service will be launched initially with only 200 non-AC buses. A separate tender process will be initiated for the remaining 300 buses at a later stage.
 
 “The date of opening technical bids had to be extended for around four times since December for various reasons, which include some technical glitches in the Haryana e-procurement website and requests from interested bidders seeking extension of the date. Four bidders participated in the technical bid on Wednesday, and now we will scrutinize their documents and open the financial bid by month end,” said a GMDA official.
 
 The authorities hope to roll out the bus service by mid-August . “The stage one of technical bidding is over and whoever meets specifications will participate in financial bidding process. The one who wins the financial bid will then have to form a special purpose vehicle,” said V Umashankar, CEO, GMDA.
