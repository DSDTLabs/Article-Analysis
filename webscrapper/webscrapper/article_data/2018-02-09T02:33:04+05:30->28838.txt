NEW DELHI:   was to get his two children—one three-year-old and another only three months old—treated with the money he had. Two days ago, when the 25-year-old was robbed, he decided to fight back. He was stabbed to death for resistance. 

 The family said Yadav had been saving up for a week to get the two children treated at a hospital and that’s why may have resisted. 
 
 Originally from Bihar, Yadav lived in Delhi with his wife and three children. He and a few others worked as vegetable vendors. On Tuesday, they left home early. “He and his wife were to take their daughter and son for treatment the same evening and so he was carrying Rs 2,000 with him,” said Raj Kumar, Yadav’s brother. 
 
 Yadav was the sole breadwinner in the family and the family is now in trouble. “My brother always wanted to give his children good education so that they don’t end up with a similar fate. Now, the only option the family has is to return to the village. I am now afraid about their future,” the brother said. 
 
 “Ravinder worked day and night and it was really tough to save money. He resisted (the robbers) so that he could use those Rs 2,000 for his children’s treatment. But his family members have now fallen sick crying over his death,” the brother said.
 
 The other victims of the gang said they were scared to venture out, especially on the same road, as they feared another attack. “I now wait till 7am so that there is police presence in the area and I don’t get attacked. The little money that I made in the last few days was also robbed along with my phone,” said Ajay Singh who was robbed at knifepoint in Tilak Nagar.
