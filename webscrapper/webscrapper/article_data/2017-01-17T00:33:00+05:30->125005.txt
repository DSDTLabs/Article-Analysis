Indore: The Indore Municipal Corporation has started issuing challans to shopkeepers, who are not disposing waste properly. Officials of the civic body conducted inspections late night on Saturday. Many shop owners who had not kept dustbins were fined. Officials said that challans of Rs 250 were issued. Commissioner of IMC Manish Singh gave strict instructions to the shopkeepers to ensure that such things do not happen in future. “We will pay surprise visits to shops. While we have levied fines of many shopkeepers, we also found that many of them have started keeping dustbins outside their shops,” Singh said. The IMC had earlier issued instructions to all the shops in the city to install two dustbins in their shops, one for renewable waste and the other for non-renewable waste. The segregated waste in collected by the door-to-door garbage collection vans. Officials said that similar instruction would be issued for private buildings in the city too. The door-to-door collection system would also be implemented in industrial areas.
