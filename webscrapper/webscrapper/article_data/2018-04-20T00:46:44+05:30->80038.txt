NEW DELHI: A   has alleged that he was brutally assaulted in   for refusing to pay them Rs 5 lakh. 

 Naveen Kumar alias Manoj claimed that he was first booked under a false case of Arms Act by the cops when he failed to give them Rs 5 lakh. On April 4, he was allegedly taken to Metro Vihar police post where he was beaten with sticks.
 
 Kumar showed injury marks all over his legs and buttocks and claimed that he endured them due to the beating by the cops. After his allegations, the court ordered that his medical be conducted again and the second MLC report was found to be different from the first one.
 
 However, cops refuted the claims and stated that the man was involved in a firing incident in Shahbad Dairy on the night of April 3. DCP (Rohini) Rajneesh Gupta said that Kumar was found in possession of a weapon which was used in the shootout. “We have initiated an inquiry into the allegations made by the man and will take necessary action,” Gupta said.
 
 Investigating officers claimed the injury marks on his body were due to a fall he had from a staircase in his house.
