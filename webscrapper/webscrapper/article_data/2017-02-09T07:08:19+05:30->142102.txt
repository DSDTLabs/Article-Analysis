VADODARA/ANAND: Congress leaders   and Rajendrasinh Parmar got unanimously elected as chairman and vice chairman of the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers Union Limited, popularly known as Amul Dairy, during a specially called board meeting in Anand on Wednesday. 

 Election of board of directors of the district dairy union was held in May 2015. But the BJP-ruled state government had nominated three representatives to the dairy’s board which the dairy had challenged in the   High Court. The state government had withdrew its nominees last month paving way to the election for the two posts. 
 
 The dairy’s board comprises of 17 members of which 13 are elected representatives while the other members include a nominee of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation, a nominee of the Kaira District Co-operative Bank, Anand district registrar and dairy’s managing director. 
 
 Ramsinh Parmar, who has remained seven times MLA from   constituency since 1990, had first got elected to the board of Amul in 1978. Since then he has been elected to the board in all the consecutive elections. 
 
 He was first elected as chairman in 1990 for a year after which he got elected again for the period between March 1996 and July 1996. Since, 2002, when he got elected as chairman, he has continued on the post. 
 
 “It is because the faith that farmers have put in me that I get re-elected. We will ensure maximum benefits to our farmer members and at the same time ensure quality milk and value added milk products to consumers in the country and across world markets,” said Ramsinh, recollecting how the dairy’s turnover was at Rs 465 crore in 2002 when he was elected as chairman while farmers were paid Rs 170 per kilo fat as procurement price. 
 
 “Our turnover is expected to cross Rs 5,600 crore this year while we are paying Rs 610 per kilo fat to our farmers as on date,” he said.
