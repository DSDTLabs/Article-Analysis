NAGPUR:“The soil of Vidarbha is not suitable for growing cotton. Still, farmers here have been concentrating on cultivating Bt cotton. This is the reason behind crop failure and farmers’ suicide,” said  , director of ICAR-National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning, Nagpur.

 Singh was delivering the Dr Ashok S   lecture organized on Friday by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri). Juwarkar was the former head of land environment and management division at Neeri. The lecture is organized every year in his memory. “Several wastelands belonging to Manganese Ore India Limited in Maharashtra, Western Coalfields Limited in   and Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Limited in Karnataka, were rejuvenated under his supervision,” recalled Neeri’s director Rakesh Kumar.
 
 Singh said 64 million hectares of cropland in the country were affected by degradation. “The problem started post 1990 due to over-exploitation of resources that led to unsustainability in agriculture and social insecurity,” he said adding that except for Brahmaputra basin, all others had dried out.
 
 As the cropped area got staggered from 1950-2010, there is no scope for horizontal expansion of agriculture, Sharma said. “Remote sensing and GIS can help in developing soil health cards. Also, soil and water conservation programmes should be taken up for small-scale farmers while subsidies should be provided only to middle-level farmers to encourage them towards diversification of crops,” he added.
