NEW DELHI:   asked the   government on Wednesday if it had thought through its decision to approach the   on  , and was not falling in Pakistan’s trap to internationalise bilateral issues, including J&K.

 The opposition party also lashed out at the Centre for the deteriorating situation in J&K in the wake of the killing of a young Kashmiri Army officer by terrorists. Asked about India’s decision to move the ICJ, Congress spokesman Ajoy Kumar said, “Has India been exposed to any kind of risks because it (the move) will also allow Pakistan to go to ICJ and raise issues?”
 
 Kumar said India’s traditional stance has been that all issues with Pakistan would be resolved bilaterally and the change could give an opening to Pakistan to internationalise Kashmir. “The best resolution (to issues) is bilateral at all times, no matter how recalcitrant Pakistan is,” he said. Senior CPI member D Raja said, “This decision has vindicated India’s stand in the international community. Pakistan will now have to reconsider its actions and decisions.
 
 With the   intervening, it reflects the larger international sentiment against Pakistan’s decision. Pakistan will be questioned thoroughly if it does not respect the ICJ’s decision." CPM politburo member Brinda Karat welcomed the decision, and said the Left parties were happy that Jadhav had received international support.
