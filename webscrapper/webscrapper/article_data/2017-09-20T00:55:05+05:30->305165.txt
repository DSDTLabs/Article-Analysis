MUMBAI: After restaurant owners petitioned the state government to review the ban on  , the government has asked the excise department to find a solution to the issue. Over 40   across the city have been shut after the excise department decided to scrap daily licences. 

 The department’s decision came after it found several restaurants were using the daily club or temporary party licence, meant for special occasions, functions and festivals, to serve customers right through the year. Officials said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has directed the excise department to review the issue and see if the condition to give licences can be reviewed to help the business. 
 
 While a host of permissions from various authorities are required and many conditions need to be fulfilled for obtaining a permanent licence to serve liquor, and since the BMC has no   restaurant policy, the excise department couldn’t give a permanent licence for the same.
 
 On Tuesday, a senior official from excise department said they have no problem in issuing permanent liquor licences to rooftop restaurants if they have restaurant licences. “It is up to the BMC to come up with a specific policy on the issue,” the official said requesting anonymity. The official also added the government has asked them to review the issue, which they are in the process of doing.
