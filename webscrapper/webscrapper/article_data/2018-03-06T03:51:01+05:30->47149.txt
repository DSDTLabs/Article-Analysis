Delhi Police questioned   MLA   for more than two hours on Monday, in connection with the alleged midnight   Anshu Prakash. Last Monday, police said they served notices to two MLAs — Tyagi and   — asking them to join the probe. 

 Tyagi appeared before police at 5pm. He was questioned on the sequence of events and asked to give a detailed account. This will be corroborated with the statement of others present there. 
 
 Police said Tyagi was evasive in his answers and denied having assaulted Prakash, or that he saw him getting beaten up.
