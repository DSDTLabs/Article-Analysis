Vadodara: The khakhee-coloured tents are a ubiquitous sight in several communally sensitive areas of the city. Inside, are the state reserve police (SRP) personnel resting on a cot in a cramped space.

 However, lives of the these men, who play a pivotal role during clashes, is all set to change for better after several years. The police department will install portable and quality cabins for the SRP men staying at makeshift tents in the old city areas. 
 
 The all-weather cabins will be installed with all the necessary facilities. 
 
 “The cabins will have a toilet, two beds, a fan, cupboards and even a weapon rack. Having iron coating and galvanized roof, it will provide quality living standard and security to the SRP men posted in sensitive areas. We have already made one such cabin that will be installed soon,” said Manoj Sashidhar, city police commissioner. 
 
 “The tents currently have no toilets, fans and even bathrooms. They have to visit neighbourhood homes or go for open defecation. The idea is to give them an ideal resting place so that their quality of life and productivity goes up,” Sashidhar added. 
 
 During rioting incidents in the past, the SRP tents made of cloth had been set on fire by the mobs. The city witnesses frequent communal clashes over petty issues.
 
 The police said that one it cost Rs 2.20 lakh to make one portable cabin and they are looking for sponsors to fund the project. 
 
 “The first cabin will be kept at Atladara check-post and we aim to have such cabins at all the 20 SRP points that are in tents in the city. We currently have four companies of SRP posted here. If the project is successful, we will approach the state government which may replicate it across the state,” Sashidhar told TOI. 
 
 The police said that given the kind of stress SRP men face while on duty, such resting place will help them in rejuvenating themselves and perform better.
