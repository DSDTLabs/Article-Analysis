AHMEDABAD:   will not have its senate and student welfare representatives’ elections for the third year, as   high court on Monday observed that the decision to hold elections has not been properly taken according to the provisions of statute as well as ordinance.

 The HC was approached by a senate member after the GU vice-chancellor took a decision on March 15 to stay the elections that were scheduled on March 25. 
 
 The challenge was on various grounds that the VC did not have power under an ordinance to stay the election process once it was already set into motion. 
 
 The membership of two senate members who got elected unopposed from medical and dental faculties was also under challenge. 
 
 Moreover, the question of application of reservation policy prescribed by the   was also raised in the petition.
 
 The HC said that there was no question of holding elections this year, but directed GU to hold the elections in time next year. The HC also directed the state government to take a decision within three months on reference made by GU with regard to the reservation policy.
 
 Earlier, the HC pulled up students and student unions for their aggression shown on campuses and the way they allegedly misbehaved with the VC’s wife after the VC stayed the elections. 
 
 The HC advised the students to focus on their studies and not to become desperate to build a career in politics through students politics.
