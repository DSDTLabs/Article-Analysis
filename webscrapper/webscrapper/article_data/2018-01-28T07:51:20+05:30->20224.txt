KOLKATA:  , who entertained Bengali cine-goers with his comic act as well as menacing performances as a villain - in films like 'Sanyasi Raja', 'Agniswar', 'Sabyasachi' and ' '- breathed his last on Friday. 

 On December 23, Bhattacharya was admitted to a private nursing where he succumbed to age-related problems. He was 84. He is survived by his two daughters and son.
 
 "He had age-related issues.   complicated the situation. It's sad that his contribution to Bengali cinema remained unsung. Not a single actor from the industry came to pay his/her respect after his demise or when he was ailing," said Dr Sujata Ray Manna, who Bhattacharya treated as his daughter.
 
  
  
 
 Bhattacharya used to work in the Indian Post and Telegraph department from where he retired in 1991. He balanced his passion and profession well and also went on to do jatras. Bhattacharya's well-built figure and convincing act in negative roles made him a popular choice when it came to either playing a robber or a cop.
 
 Director  , who cast him in 'Goopi Bagha Phire Elo', remembers him as a 'great actor' to work with. "Despite his talent, Bengali cinema typecast him as a villain. For Bengali movie-goers, it was easy to accept him in negative roles where his physique and looks were an asset. Whenever I would bump into him at the studio, he would just say: ' 't forget, I am still around and would want to work'," Ray said.
 
 Though primarily known as a 'villain' in  , few can forget Bhattacharya's comic act in Umanath Bhattacharya's 'Charmurti'. He stole the show wearing a ghagra and dancing to the tune of 'Ghachang Pu Khabo Toke'.
 
 Much before he did movies, Bhattacharya left a mark on the stage. Veteran theatre personality Asit Basu said: "From '64 to '71, he had worked as an actor in the Little Theatre Group. For a couple of years, he was also the secretary of the group. ."
