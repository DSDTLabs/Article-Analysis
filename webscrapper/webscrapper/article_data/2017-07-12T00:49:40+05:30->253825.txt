Thane: After the   (SC) ruled that the   in the   can be denotified as national  , proprietors and staff of restaurants and bars along the highway were in a celebratory mood. 

 The ban imposed on restaurants and wine shops within 500 meters of the national highway had majorly hit all eateries and liquor dens along the Ghodbunder Road as well as most of the hotels in Thane.
 
 With most hotel revenue heavily dependent on alcohol sales, the SC ban had hit business and a few of them were forced to downsize.
 
 “The hotel industry is lobour intensive and sales determine the staffing pattern. With 80 per cent of the business depending on   asking for liquor, any order to stop serving liquor is bound to make a negative impact on not just revenue collection but also employment. It was not feasible to have the same number of employees for 20 per cent business,” said Brijesh Sharma, owner of Shelter restaurant on Ghodbunder Road. 
 
 The ban had also affected liquor distributors whose business went down completely as no dining places were taking alcohol stock from them.
 
 “Almost 40 per cent of our business went down due to the SC ban. Of the 250-odd restaurants and bars which had permits to sell liquor, more than 100 were hit. Also, the business impacted more in Thane as compared to Mumbai as this city has more such food-cum-liquor joints along the highways,” said a liquor distributor.
 
 Residents said that they are relieved that they will no more have to go to pubs outside Thane. “There were so many options that one could choose from if they wished to have liquor along with friends in a good ambience. But after the ban one had to go to neighbouring cities like Mulund, Ghatkopar or to the suburbs. This had even come as a big hole in the pocket as one had to put in cash to travel back home in fleet cabs,” said Valerian Andrews, resident of Ghodbunder Road.
