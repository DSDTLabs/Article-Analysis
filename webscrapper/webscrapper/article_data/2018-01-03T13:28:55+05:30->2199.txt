PANAJI: The directorate of fire and emergency services has been conducting safety audits of government buildings, educational institutions and hospitals and will compile a report this month. 

 The directorate was asked to relook fire safety measures and check compliance following the major fire that broke out at the   bus stand in October where losses were pegged at Rs 1.20 crore.
 
 Director of fire and emergency services   said the directorate has proposed the setting up of a distinct fire preventive cell that will only concentrate on inspection and prevention of fires. 
 
 The fire inspection system has been decentralised with three zones — North, Central and South — where inspections are carried out and fire clearances issued at the local level to permit ease of doing business.
 
 According to the official gazette of December 2014, high rise buildings over 16m from the ground, shipyards, industrial buildings, shipyards, workshops, tank farms of petroleum products, flammable gas godowns, public spaces and establishments registered under the Goa Establishments Act, 1973, owners or occupiers have to take fire safety precautions. 
 
 These include means of access and exit requirements, underground/overhead water static tank, fire service standard inlet connections, first and hose reel, automatic sprinkler system, fire extinguisher of ISI certification mark, automatic fire detection and fire alarm system, illuminated exit way marking signs, fire check doors and fire resistant doors, public address system, alternate source of electric supply, explosion suppression/venting system, and barrier free access.
