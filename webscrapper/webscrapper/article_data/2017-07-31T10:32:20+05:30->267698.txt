PUNE: In an attempt to sensitise people on the skewed sex ratio, members of a city-based NGO have undertaken a unique initiative, wherein they will use an autorickshaw to visit 161 districts in India under the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme.

 The 50-day long campaign ‘Rickshwathon’ kicked off on Sunday.
 
 The aim of the campaign is to create awareness and educate people about the ill effects of the   number of girl child. The State Women Commission has extended its support to the campaign. 
 
 Girish Laad, director, Rising India Research Foundation, a Pune-based NGO that initiated the campaign said, “Two members have volunteered for the campaign, which kicked off from Pune. One of the members is a non-resident Indian (NRI) and the other one is from Wai in Satara district. They will visit 161 districts in India where the sex ratio is skewed.”
 
 “The volunteers will hold discussions with the local NGOs and women welfare commission officials on local issues. They will also conduct awareness programmes and educate people along their way. They will speak about the adverse effects of sex selective abortion and the plummeting girl child number in our society,” Laad said.
 
 Pune Mayor Mukta Tilak flagged-off the campaign around 9.30am on Sunday.
 
 Incidentally, the latest report underlines the concern about falling sex ratio at birth in Maharashtra.
 
 According to a report from the state health department, Maharashtra’s sex ratio at birth dipped by eight points in 2016 as compared to the previous year,. The report says the ratio of newborn girls per 1,000 boys went down from 907 in 2015 to 899 in 2016.
 
 The report, which is based on the Civil Registration System under the Birth and Death Registration Act, notes that the sex ratio at birth in Pune district showed a promising upward trend till 2014. However, it went down to 891 in 2015 and fell sharply by 53 points to 838 in 2016. In fact, among the districts in Maharashtra, Pune and Osmanabad registered the second-highest decline in the sex ratio at 53 points. The worst decline was in Washim district (62 points). Ideally, 951 girls should be born for every 1,000 boys, the report says.
 
 The Union government had started the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme in 161 districts in India to arrest the decline in girl child sex ratio and promote women’s empowerment to improve women’s status in the country.
 
 According to the data available on the ministry of women and child development website, the census of 2011 showed a significant declining trend in the Child Sex Ratio (CSR) in the country.
 
 The data reveals that the number of girls for every 1,000 boys between the age group of 0-6 years reached an all-time low of 918 in 2011 from 976 in 1961.
