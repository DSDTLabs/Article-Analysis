NEW DELHI: Nearly a year after Delhi   hit headlines for a   played at the   metro station, the mass transit authority has said it has been unable to identify the culprit despite “best efforts”.

 In response to an RTI query by Aseem Takyar, the   (DMRC) said, “Identity of the person involved in display of pornography content on LED TV screening at Rajiv Chowk Metro Station could not be established despite best efforts.” 
 
 The Delhi Metro said an internal inquiry had been conducted and the report sent to the Delhi Police. “Based on inquiry, as a preventive measure all security features were ensured to be enabled on LED screens during further commissioning of LED TVs,” it said. 
 
 The incident had occurred on April 9 last year when a porn clip played on the LED system at the Rajiv Chowk station for 10 minutes. According to reports, it had just been commissioned and its wifi port was accessible. In a statement soon after, the Delhi Metro had said: “From preliminary investigation, it is established that the incident is of 9th April at around 5pm. The LED TV (Smart TV having multiple features) system was under commissioning and wifi port was accessible. Prima facie, as per CCTV footage, three men have run porn clip through their mobile on this TV at Rajiv Chowk station. CCTV footage is under examination to identify the culprits.”
 
 The Delhi Metro had also said that it would ensure that “this sort of interference with the system” will not be possible in future and that the software is centrally controlled. “In the interim, during the commissioning process itself the contractor will be advised to ensure password protection,” it had said.
