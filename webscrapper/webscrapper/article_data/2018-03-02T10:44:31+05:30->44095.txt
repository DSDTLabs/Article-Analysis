Having witnessed unprecedented shortfall in fulfilling the domestic water requirement of the city last year due to drought and subsequent poor yield from bore wells, the   has planned to introduce a ‘Save Water’ campaign among residents to promote the judicious use of water.

 With more than one lakh metered connections, the civic body said that close to 55% of the demand, that is around 122mld is addressed through borewells established on   and   riverbeds. However,   sources said that May and July will be very critical for them to fulfil the water needs due to extreme summer.
 
 The city, once known for supplying potable water to households twice a day has been forced to supply the same on alternate days last year due to poor yield in the corporation’s borewells. The unprecedented move saw backlash from residents who were used to receive adequate quantum of potable water each day. To avoid the recurrence with dedicated summer about to commence, the urban local body (ULB) has planned to conduct a month-long awareness campaign promoting the judicious usage of potable water. "Under the theme ‘save water’, we have planned to place awareness hoardings and rope in students for conducting awareness drives among residents," corporation commissioner N Ravichandran said.
 
 Corporation sources said that they will not solely depend on the borewells and collector wells in Kollidam and Cauvery riverbeds for addressing the water needs and claimed that a contingency plan would be chalked out to supply adequate quantum during summer.
 
 As outflow from   dam to delta districts was restricted to 500 cusecs for the past couple of weeks now. The situation may worsen if the mercury levels surge in the absence of summer showers.
