NEW DELHI: The   plans to write to the government suggesting that candidates who have been charged in a voter bribery case be debarred from contesting polls for five years thereafter. 

 The poll watchdog will be approaching the law ministry soon to amend the Representation of the People Act to disqualify candidates named in chargesheets for bribing voters from contesting elections to Lok Sabha as well as assembly for up to five years after the court frames charges, sources in EC told TOI on Sunday. 
 
 The recommendation is in line with the election panel’s tough stance on poll bribery. Since last year, the commission has cancelled three assembly bypolls in Tamil Nadu– in Aravakurichi and Thanjavur in 2016 and R K Nagar recently– after noticing large scale attempts by political parties to influence voters with gifts and other inducements. 
 
 The EC had earlier suggested to the home ministry to make poll bribery a cognizable offence by amending the Criminal Procedure Code, apart from asking the law ministry to consider including large scale poll bribery as a valid ground for countermanding of poll. Only recently, the commission indefinitely put off the R K Nagar assembly bypoll after it found that money was used to influence voters. The bypoll, which was to be held on April 12, was necessitated following the death of J Jayalalithaa. 
 
 
 
 
 In its lengthy order, the commission had pointed out that political parties and their top leaders used “innovative ways” to bribe voters in the R K Nagar assembly seat to outwit law enforcement authorities mandated with keeping an eye on poll expenditure. Many complaints were received by the commission on inducement given to voters by distributing money and gifts in innovative forms like tokens, including for milk, prepaid phone recharge coupons, newspaper subscription, money transfer in no-frill accounts in banks and even mobile wallets.
