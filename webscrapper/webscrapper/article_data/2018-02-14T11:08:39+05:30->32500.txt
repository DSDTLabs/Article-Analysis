PANAJI: A day after the   cancelled mining leases in the state and ordered stopping of all operations from March 16, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office called for a report on the economic impact of the judgment on Goa, chief minister   said on Tuesday. 

 Parrikar said the state will e-auction the already mined ore, which will yield enough revenue for the current mining season ending May 31. He said the actual impact, if any, of the ban will be felt only in the next mining season.
 
 
  
 
 “I received a call from the PMO, as PM was not in India. They asked what is the issue, what is the economic impact and sought a report. PM sent a message that I could meet him in person if needed. This was the message from his office,” the chief minister said.
 
 Last week, the Supreme Court quashed the second renewal of lease granted to the mining companies by the state government.
 
 “I will be speaking to the mining belt MLAs on Wednesday. But it will take some time to analyse the impact. Presently, there is no crisis as we have time till March 15. We will see that it is pulled up to May 31 by e-auction and other means. So the issue of this season is resolved. Whatever ore is left for e-auctioning, we will do it so that the current season is taken care of,” said Parrikar .
 
 He, however, said that he is not in favour of forming a mining corporation to tackle the issue. “Some people suggest that a corporation be set up. Is there any other way? You have seen how corporations function. Will the government really be able is the question. I do hold my own opinion, but I will consult all stakeholders and only then will I tell you the final policy,” said Parrikar.
