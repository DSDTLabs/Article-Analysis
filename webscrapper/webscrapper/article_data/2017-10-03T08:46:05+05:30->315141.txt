GURUGRAM: The   administration has asked Neerja  , the suspended principal of Ryan International School's   branch where Class II student Pradhyumn Thakur was murdered, to join another branch of the school in the city as a teacher. But the Ryan campus she was sent to, in Sector 40, said it was not willing to accommodate Batra.

 A senior school management official of the Ryan Sector 40 branch, who did not wish to be named, said: â€œThe deputy commissioner has ordered us to take Neerja Batra but we do not feel this is the right decision. She will not be joining us immediately as she still remains suspended from her job."
 
 Deputy commissioner   was put in charge of   after the Haryana government took over control of the school for three months. Batra was suspended after the September 8 murder of the seven-year-old boy , allegedly by a school bus conductor after a failed sexual assault attempt. Batra has been questioned by police but no case has been filed against her. The police does not hold her accountable as she had informed the school's administration of security loopholes before the murder.
 
 The official of the Sector 40 branch, however, said the decision to send Batra there was not acceptable. Singh said it was up to the school management to decide where it would employ Batra.
