NEW DELHI: The English bard Shakespeare may have said ‘what’s in a name’ but for  , a misspelt name in government rolls delayed his posting as well as made him lose out on seniority. Now in a scathing order to the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board, information commissioner   has pulled up the board and issued a show cause notice to the public information officer for the delay in response to Handa’s   application.

 In a first, the order, while noting the “unjust mental agony” and “pecuniary loss” suffered by Handa, has sought to know why he shouldn’t be entitled to compensation by DSSSB. The order adds, “The Noticee is directed to explain why penalty to the tune of Rs 25,000 should not be imposed upon him for causing deliberate obstruction to the flow of information and also explain why a compensation to the tune of Rs 3 lakh should not be awarded to the applicant, by the DSSSB.”
 
 Handa, who applied for a post in 2012 and was selected in 2015 through an exam by the DSSSB, however had to wait till September 2016 to get the job, as his name was registered as ‘Siddharth Manda’ on the DSSSB rolls.
 
 Despite repeated RTI applications, Handa was denied information on why his request was not being met by the DSSSB, a fact that earned the ire of Azad when it finally came to the notice of the central information commission ( ).
 
 “The PIO and DS CC-II has not only denied information and justice to the applicant but also acted in complete contravention and violation of the provisions of the RTI Act and in contempt of the orders of the FAA. Despite the approval of Chairman, DSSSB for carrying out the rectification of records in December 2015, the needful was done only in August 2016.”
 
 The public information officer comes in for special censure in the order, with Azad adding, “In fact, the concerned PIO did not even bother to appear before the Commission and explain the cause of such inordinate delay in taking remedial measure.”
