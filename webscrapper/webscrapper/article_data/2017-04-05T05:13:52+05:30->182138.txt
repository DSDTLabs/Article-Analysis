MUMBAI: The Bombay high court rejected the bail application of a Mulund resident accused of allegedly raping his stepdaughter after she told the judge that she was forced to retract her statement. Justice   had interviewed the girl after learning of a statement she had recorded before a magistrate about having lodged the FIR to teach her stepfather a lesson for not allowing her to be on soci al media or meet her boyfriends.

 The court noted that she had resiled from her complaint after her mother, who is also an accused in the case, was released on bail. “After interviewing the victim and taking her into confidence, this court is convinced that the statement (before the magistrate) was given under pressure and coercion and that she had retracted from her earlier statement only to save the family . The survivor is not residing with her mother at pre sent,“ said Justice Jadhav, while relying on the statements of other witnesses, who had helped the girl lodge the complaint.
 
 “Taking into consideration heinousness of offence committed by the accused, this court is of the opinion that he does not deserve to be enlarged on bail,“ said the judge. The survivor, who was below 18 years old, had in August 2016 confided to one of her friends that her stepfather used to   her since he married her mother in 2005. The fri end called the child helpline number and reported the incident. The girl said she had spoken to her mother about it but was asked to remain quiet.
 
 After the mother was released on bail by a special court, the girl's statement was recorded before a magistrate, where she apparently said that the FIR was false. She told the magistrate that she did not wish that her parents were prosecuted for being strict with her. (Names withheld to protect survivor's identity)
