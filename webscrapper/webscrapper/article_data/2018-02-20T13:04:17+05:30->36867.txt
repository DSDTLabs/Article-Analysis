COIMBATORE: A group of residents belonging to the SC community at Majara   in   in   taluk on Monday submitted a petition to the district collector seeking land patta and permanent houses.

 About 150 families live in 50 huts and shacks in the locality. “Over the past 15 years, newly-wed couples and those who have come to live in the locality from other places had no option but to sleep outside. Families with toddlers and school children are facing severe difficulties,” the petition said.
 
 “We have to abandon our huts and seek a shelter when it rains heavily,” said  , a 60-year-old woman, who lives in a shack. 
 
 As there is no poromboke land in Varappalayam, they sought land on the sides of the Koduvai Senjeri Hill Road.
 
 Kalavathi, another petitioner, said they could apply for ration cards and free toilet scheme only if they have land patta.
