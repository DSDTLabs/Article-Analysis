MOHANLALGANJ: Better known for making controversial remarks, BJP's Unnao MP   described the Congress' symbol of "hand" as a khooni panja that had looted the nation since Independence. 

 Addressing an election meeting on Saturday for Independent candidate RK Chaudhary, who has the BJP's support in Mohanlalganj, he also called BSP chief Mayawati "daulat ki beti", who was taking the help of criminals for power even as he accused chief minister Akhilesh Yadav of ill-treating his father Mulayam Singh Yadav. 
 
 Chaudhary was earlier in BSP but revolted against Mayawati and is now contesting as Independent. 
 
 Maharaj said Chaudhary was the real "Dalit ke Beta". Accusing Mayawati of giving ticketes to candidates with criminal antecedents, he said, "Gunda chhadhega haathi par toh goli marega chhati par (Elephant happens to be symbol of BSP), in a clear distortion of Mayawati's slogan of "chadh gundan kee chhati par, button dabao hathi par."
