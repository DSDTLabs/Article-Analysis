MUMBAI: State’s records show that farmers in Mumbai secured benefits to the tune of Rs 287.19 crore under the 2009 loan waiver schemes announced by the   government. 

 State Congress chief and former chief minister Ashok Chavan raised doubts after the Maharashtra government announced that debt-ridden cultivators in the city and suburbs would get relief from the 2017 loan write-off plan. 
 
 Chavan had questioned the tweet by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday that there were 694 farmers in Mumbai and 119 in the suburbs. A high-ranking bureaucrat confirmed to TOI that farmers existed in Mumbai and the suburbs earlier and that they also got relief under the loan waiver scheme declared by the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government in 2008 and Congress-NCP government in 2009.
 
 The bureaucrat claimed that when the UPA government declared the loan waiver scheme, 270 farmers–269 from Mumbai city and one from the suburbs–benefited as their loans to the tune of Rs 2.87 crore were waived. In 2009, when the state government declared the loan waiver scheme, it wrote off Rs 287.19 crore in debt. 
 
 Among the financial institutions, who had given loans to farmers in 2009, included Mumbai Bank (Rs 1.8 lakh), SBI, Andhra Bank, Karnataka Bank and Dena Bank (Rs 286.72 crore) and urban banks (Rs 44.73 lakh).
 
 In 2009, loans to the tune of Rs 2,011 crore were disbursed by financial institutions in western Maharashtra. The corresponding figures for Konkan, Marathwada and Vidarbha were Rs 360 crore, Rs 969 crore and Rs 482 crore.
 
 Leader of the opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil on Thursday asked Fadnavis to explain why only 89 lakh farmers out of 1.36 crore were considered under the loan waiver scheme.
