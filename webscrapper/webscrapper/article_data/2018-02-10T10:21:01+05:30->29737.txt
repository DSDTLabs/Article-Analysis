CHANDIGARH: Union food processing industry minister and Bathinda   on Friday asked Punjab chief minister   to issue statutory permissions for two cold chain projects sanctioned for the state that have been inordinately delayed. 

 In a letter to the CM, Harsimrat said both cold chain projects had the potential to generate thousands of direct and indirect jobs for youth and ensure enhanced prices for the farmers. 
 
 The union minister said, "The apathy of state government functionaries in not granting the required statutory permissions on time is a cause of concern as delaying the projects deprives the farmers and youth of the benefits that they are likely to get as a result of early operationalization of these projects." tnn
