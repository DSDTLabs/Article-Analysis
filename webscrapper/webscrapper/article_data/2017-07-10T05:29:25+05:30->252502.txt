Gurgaon: At least 100 residents of the housing society Gurgaon 21 within township Vatika India Next in Sector 83 took out a protest march around 10.30am on Sunday, against “exorbitant common area maintenance charges and poor quality of construction in the society”.

 Starting from the society, the protesters marched 2.5km to  , where the society has a facility and sales office, and submitted their complaint to concerned authorities.
 
 The residents complained plaster from ceilings and terraces in the flats have been falling off whenever there is a storm or heavy wind. “In May this year, a huge chunk of plaster (around 50kg) shredded off the F2 tower and fell through the stairwell, which completely shattered the heavy plastic dustbin kept by housekeeping staff on the ground floor,” said Suneet Gupta, a resident of the society..
 
 Residents also complained that Enviro, the maintenance agency, is charging them extremely high common area maintenance charges. “The maintenance agency conducted a study on upkeep cost of our society, compared with others. Enviro came out as the most expensive,” said Hemant Bharti, another resident. Enviro’s maintenance cost is Rs 3.26/sq ft while that of  , which is close by, is Rs 2.65/sq ft.
 
 “We didn’t want to protest but after three years of trying to contact the developer, we were left with no option,” said Rajeev Singh, RWA president.
