Mumbai:   aims to double its customer base to 1.6 crore in 18 months through its latest digital initiative christened 811 (pronounced eight one one), said  , VC & MD, Kotak Bank on Wednesday.

 As part of its aggressive organic growth plan, it is banking heavily on the digital push, and 811 will bring in every aspect of banking on a single mobile platform. It would also enable new account opening in just five minutes using only income tax   and   number. 
 
 Kotak also put put to rest all media speculation, at least for some time, about any acquisition that the bank was pursuing to grow. 
 
 “Merger of ING Vysya Bank with Kotak Bank in April 2015 doubled our geographical spread. Now with 811, we embark on a bold organic growth journey,” Kotak said. He also said that with 811, the bank became the first lender to integrate Aadhaar-based OTP verification into banking, introduced by the RBI last December. The bank will also allow zero balance account opening through this channel and will continue to offer 6% interest rate to savings bank holders. 
 
 Kotak Bank’s 811 offering is not a wallet but a full-fledged bank account, Kotak said. Kotak said that the name 811 was derived from the date the government started its demonetisation process, November 8, and said this will help the bank acquire customers without physical presence through branches.
 
 The bank’s board is meeting on Thursday to decide on its future fund raising plan, including offloading new shares to institutional investors, also called   issue. It has already started talking to merchant bankers to gauge investor interest for an offering as much as $1.8 billion (about Rs 12,000 crore).
