CHENNAI:   O Panneerselvam on Tuesday sought the intervention of Prime Minister   to stop construction of check dams by Kerala across the   river as it is being done “without obtaining the prior concurrence of Tamil Nadu and in violation of the final order of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal.”

 Panneerselvam pointed to media reports about Kerala government’s plan to construct six check dams across the Bhavani river, a tributary of the river Cauvery.
 
 “The Kerala government may also be advised not to take up any project or works without obtaining the prior concurrence of the Tamil Nadu government and until the Cauvery Management Board and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee come into force and judicial references are finally settled,” the chief minister said in a letter to Modi.
 
 Panneerselvam said the media reports have caused great concern and anxiety among the people of Tamil Nadu dependent on waters of the Cauvery basin including the Bhavani, for irrigation and drinking water supply.
 
 The chief minister said he was informed that the Kerala had commenced earth work for laying the foundation of two check dams at Thekkuvattai and Manjikandi. Further, at Padavayal, the work of levelling the land has commenced and materials for laying the foundation have also been stocked.
 
 “I wish to inform that any attempt to construct check dams across the Bhavani river without disclosing the details of schemes and obtaining the prior concurrence of the Tamil Nadu government, violating the order of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, will affect the natural flow of the Bhavani river, and consequently diminish the flows to Tamil Nadu,” Panneerselvam said.
