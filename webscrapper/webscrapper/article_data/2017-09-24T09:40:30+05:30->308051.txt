CHANDIGARH: Punjab   chief vigilance officer will conduct an inquiry into how the university’s inspection committee granted temporary affiliation to CGM College Mohlan, Mukstar, during the past five years.

 The decision came after the university’s second-highest governing body, the syndicate, tabled a report by a committee which paid a surprise visit to the college on August 12 and found out that a school was being run on its premises. After the inspection, the committee decided that no examination centre will be set up in the college
 
 During a discussion lasting one and a half hours, syndicate members said the   should look at how the college got affiliation for three courses. 
 
 In its report, the three-member committee made eight observations against the college’s management.
 
 The committee said no classes were held in the college except that of BSc agriculture. On the day of the visit, the committee said, when the college’s management learnt about the inspection, it asked school students who were present in the college’s classrooms to flee from the back gate. The committee said this pointed to a school being run from its premises.
 
 According to the committee’s report, teachers appointed for the college were asked to take classes of the school. The committee, while referring to the salary record, said teachers were paid through bank, but the whole amount was withdrawn on the same day and this was unusual.
 
 It said though the college had been operating for five years, one of its buildings did not have a single room, door or window. The committee was also suspicious of the method used by previous inspection panels for giving affiliation to the college. It said, previously, all committee members belonged to the evening studies department. It added that hardly any students attended college classes regularly, but several of them were appearing in university examinations and this raised suspicion of large-scale cheating.
