CHENNAI: Shocked by a   statement that 94 children (48 girls and 46 boys) were rescued from begging after concerted raids conducted by 47 special teams on April 21, the Madras high court said people responsible for the rackets must face stringent penal action.

 “We are hopeful that either police or authorities under the Factories Act and other enactments will take appropriate penal action against the persons who are responsible for either employing the children or allowing them to beg,” said a division bench of Justice S Nagamuthu and Justice V Bharatidasan, in its recent order. The bench has adjourned the case to June 9.
 
 Besides 94 children, 79 adults, including 70 women, were secured, said  , additional commissioner of police, law and order (south), Chennai.
 
 Coimbatore city commissioner A Amalraj filed an affidavit stating that police have rescued 91 children. Of them five children had been pushed into begging while others were employed in various establishments, he said.
 
 Child trafficking and begging came into focus after M B Nirmal, founder of Exnora International, filed a habeas corpus petition to trace eight-month-old Vimal and the nine-month-old Sharanya, who were taken away by a car-borne gang while they were sleeping on the platform with their parents on Wall Tax Road in Chennai last year.
 
 The bench has since been issuing a series of orders. In pursuant to one such directive, police filed an affidavit stating that operations in Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts led to the rescue of the 94 children. While parents of 17 have been identified, the remaining 73 children (40 girls and 33 boys) have been lodged at 12 homes as per directions of Child Welfare Committees, which carried out verification of parentage.
