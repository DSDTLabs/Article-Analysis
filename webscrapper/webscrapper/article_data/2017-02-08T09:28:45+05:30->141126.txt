NEW DELHI: The government seems to be riding on the enhanced fuel cess and collection of user fee to push the  . At least 85% of the total allocation for   proposed in the Budget (2017-18) will come from these two revenue sources.

 Estimates suggest that out of Rs 64,900 crore allocation for the sector for the next financial year, Rs 55,369 crore will come in the form of fuel cess and toll, which is the highest ever. This is being seen as a sustainable financing model to continue the government’s thrust on building more  , which has potential to create more employment and push  .
 
 The share of fuel cess for highway development has increased dramatically after 2014-15. Records show it was merely around Rs 2000 crore in 2003-04 and increased to about Rs 9,600 crore in 2014-15. But the significant jump happened during 2015-16 when the highways sector received nearly Rs 23,000 crore of fuel cess for road development.
 
 Because of additional excise duty levied by government on petrol and diesel, the collection of both cess and excise have gone up in the past two financial years. Justifying the increase in excise on fuel, the government had said that part of this will be used for developmental activities, particularly national highways and rural roads. It had said that those who consume petrol and diesel and use these roads must pay for it.
 
 The fuel cess collected from the sale of diesel and petrol goes to the Central Road Fund (CRF) and subsequently it’s allocated for national highways, state and rural roads besides for railways to take up construction of rail over bridges. Highway sector get over 50% of this cess.
 
 Budget data show that actual total collection of fuel cess during 2015-16 was Rs 69,540 crore. During the current financial year, it’s estimated to be around Rs 80,800 crore and for the fiscal year (2017-18) it’s estimated to be around Rs 81,200 crore.
 
 CRF was first constituted in March 1929 by setting apart Rs 2.64 paise per litre out of the customs and central excise duty levied on petrol for the development of state roads. The CRF was revamped in 1998-99 and the CRF Act came into force from November 2000 during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.
