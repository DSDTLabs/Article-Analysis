HYDERABAD: Congress leaders   and   Kumar Reddy on Saturday slammed chief minister   for not having the minimum courtesy to acknowledge that it is Congress which granted statehood to  , after which he became the CM.

 Responding sharply to KCR’s remarks against Congress and Uttam Kumar, Shabbir said, “I want to remind KCR of his alleged involvement in passport scam during his early days into politics.” He dared the CM to hold a public meet in  , where the students are ready to chase him away for making empty promises on filling up of vacancies.
 
 Demanding an apology from KCR for making personal remarks against Uttam Kumar, Shabbir said KCR has gained reputation of being a pheku (bluff master) and has lost credibility. Uttam said as the main opposition party, Congress has the responsibility to keep a check on whether or not the government is utilising public money appropriately. “We are highlighting misuse of public money by KCR and his family. Even PM does not live in such a luxurious building as KCR lives in Pragati Bhavan,” Uttam said.
 
 Uttam sought to remind KCR that he had claimed during statehood movement that his children were living in the US and would not join politics. “Presently, his entire family including son, daughter, son-in-law and nephews are enjoying top positions in the government and party.”
