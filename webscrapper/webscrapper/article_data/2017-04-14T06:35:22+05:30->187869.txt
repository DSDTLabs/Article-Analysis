LUCKNOW: Internal survey of Lucknow Municipal Corporation to realign periphery of wards shows the pattern of population growth in Lucknow since 2005, when wards were last revised. In core city, population growth rate per ward has been decreasing constantly while it has been exponential in the outskirts—almost double the population standard for each ward. 

 This is because the inner city got saturated by late 1990s and offered hardly any scope for development. Hence, all residential colonies started developing along the   on highways like Kanpur, Faizabad and Sultanpur roads. A town planner in Lucknow Development Authority said, “Since the wards within the city got saturated, there grew in commercial value. We could only change their land use from residential to commercial. But development of residential localities and townships could only happen on the outskirts as there were large chunks of unused land there.” 
 
 Since land was scarce in the city, government started promoting   culture in 2000 which increased the density of population on land compared to single houses/plots. Also, there are many localities like Mahanagar, Aliganj, etc where families have migrated to bigger cities or abroad for job prospects, resulting in dip in population. The growth has been so disproportionate that   has to revise the 110 wards’ periphery afresh based on census 2011, ahead of municipal polls this year. 
 
 Census 2001 showed Lucknow’s population at 21.85 lakh. In 2005 when wards were revised based on 2001 census, it was ensured that every ward has equal population of about 19800 people. However in 2011, census shows Lucknow’s population at 28.17 lakh which means distribution of 25600 people in every ward.
 
 But while surveying wards, LMC found that in core city wards like Nishatganj, Colvin Taluqdars’ College, Hazratganj, etc, the population growth rate has been less compared to the outskirts like Chinhat, Faizullahganj, Sitapur Road, Raebareli Road etc. Additional municipal commissioner P K Srivastava said, “We have to revise wards based on population growth. The inner wards have less population, so we have to increase their area by clubbing another ward with it. On the outskirts, population in a few wards has reached beyond 50,000-60,000, so we need to divide them into two wards.”
