BHOPAL: A rare arthroscopic surgery was successfully performed at   ( ), according to a press release here on Monday. The intervention took place on Saturday. In the minimally invasive surgical procedure on a joint, an endoscope was inserted through a small incision. The patient   was suffering from ankle synovitis, a condition in which soft tissue lining of the ankle joint becomes inflamed. It causes severe pain and swelling. It can be caused due to injury and overuse, said Gandhi Medical College (GMC) department of orthopaedics professor Dr Ashish Gohiya. 

 Inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis) and osteoarthritis can also cause synovitis. “Membrane in the joint gets swollen and is the cause of pain and disability in the patient. The diseased part is removed. Till now open synovitomy was conducted. By arthroscopic surgery, there is better coverage,” he added.
 
 Arthroscopic surgery for ankle is rare and GMC is the one of the few centres that conducts the procedure. Ankle arthroscopy is useful for minimally invasive ankle fusio in arthritis cases, fracture repair in ankle fractures, ligament injuries of ankle, ankle impingement, infection, loose body removal and others procedures. After the first arthroscopic surgery at GMC, the patient is expected to make a full recovery, he added.
