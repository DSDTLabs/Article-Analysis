KOCHI: City school managements are furious over a recent directive by the regional   office asking them to abstain from holding Saturday classes for students from grade I to V. 

  Managements are miffed over the fact that CBSE put forward this directive without consulting any of the schools.
 
  This directive by the CBSE is in response to a suggestion by Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, who had received several complaints of children being overburdened at schools and requesting them to take action against the Saturday classes. 
 
  "As per the Right to Education Act, there must only be 200 working days for students from grade I to V. But CBSE and CICSE schools in the state have been holding regular classes on Saturdays," said Babu Narikuni, a former member of the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. 
 
  "This order does not confirm with the ground reality that haunts school facilities in the state," said T P M Ibrahim Khan, chairman of  .
 
  He said that schools in the city remain shut on several working days due unforeseeable reasons including strikes and are often unable to follow the charted syllabus.
 
  On many occasions, schools organize extra classes in order to complete the syllabus before the examination deadlines.
 
  "We are talking about children who are not more than 10 to 12 years old. Children have the right to leisure and spend time with their family. Even extracurricular activities can be held after school hours, instead of Saturdays. It is more important that they get their weekend," said Babu Narikuni.
 
  Khan said that the new decision will cause great inconvenience for parents.
 
  "Several students come to school on Saturday for their extracurricular activities, this is an opportunity for the children to learn and explore things other than their subject. In a family where both parents are working this is a safe solution, which also helps the child learn something productive," he added.
