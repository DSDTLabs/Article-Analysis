Coimbatore: Even though the rural local bodies regularised more than 10,000 plots in the last few months, the civic body has been piling up files delaying the approvals of unapproved individual plots. As per corporation officials, around 500 applications have been received so far. “We have gained revenue of nearly Rs 3.5cr. We are according approvals and have received another 1,500 applications. Applicants have to fill up challans and pay the due amount to get approval,” town planning officer Ravichandran said. However, he did not reveal the number of approvals given so far. Corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan said that he had instructed the officials to speed up the process and clear all the files quickly. The government has decided to extend the deadline by six months. The process was extremely slow in rural local bodies initially. However, special camps were held at various locations including Sulur, S S Kulam, Madhukkarai, Veerakerala, Periyanaickenpalayam and other blocks in which bank officials, panchayat officials came under one roof and approvals were accorded within hours. As per the process, the applicant needs to register online by paying Rs 500 and then paying Rs 600 per sqm. Some officials said that since the fee was higher, many applicants had delayed payments.  But, activists said that even those who had paid the fee were not accorded approvals. Civic activist SP Thiyagarajan said that several applicants had been waiting for months to get approval. “This scheme was brought to reduce the time and make it easy for public to get approval. But it is only making it more difficult for the plot owners,” he said. Sources said that even in the local bodies, several panchayat officials were not very keen on giving approvals and delayed the process. But, several camps were held in the last few weeks due to the intervention of senior officials.
