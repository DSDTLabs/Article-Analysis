ERODE: Aggrieved at officials’ failure to supply them potable water for the past six months, residents of   in   panchayat here on Saturday staged a road roko.

 Traffic on   village panchayat road was disrupted for almost two hours as residents of Ellappalayam and Sittasalai took to the road with pots.
 
 Vellankoil panchayat officials had set up borewells in several pockets of the panchayat. And they used to fill the tanks, enabling the residents to have potable water through borewells.
 
 “Most bore wells had gone dry due to drought. And we were not distributed potable water for the past six months. We are struggling without water and forced to walk nearly 5km to fetch water from other villages,” the protesters said.
 
 The residents also pointed out that the couple bore wells, which are now functioning, might run out of water at any time. “If those bore wells also go dry, the water crisis will aggravate,” they said.
 
 When alerted, Siruvalur police and panchayat officials rushed to the spot and assured that they would take necessary steps to address the issue. Subsequently, the residents withdrew the protest.
