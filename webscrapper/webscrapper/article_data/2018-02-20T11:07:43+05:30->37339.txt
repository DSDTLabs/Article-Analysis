THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader   has alleged that the murder of   leader   has happened with the knowledge of the   leaders. Now, the CPM has the responsibility to explain to the people of the state why they had to carry out such a brutal murder, Chennithala said. 

 Chennithala inaugurated the indefinite dharna of Youth Congress state president Dean Kuriakose and vice-president C R Mahesh before secretariat on Monday. The leaders launched the protest demanding the arrest of the CPM leaders who were involved in the conspiracy behind Shuhaib's killing. 
 
 He flayed the chief minister for remaining silent on the murder that has happened in his home district. "His silence shows that his party has active role behind the killing and his party leaders were well aware of it. It is nothing but shameful for a chief minister who is unwilling to condemn the killing," said the opposition leader. Chennithala also alleged that those who were arrested were not real culprits. "We strongly have a doubt whether the people who have been surrendered are the real murderers. There is every doubt that they are dummy culprits paraded by the CPM," he said.
 
 The opposition leader said that already several photos of those surrendered before police standing along with the chief minister and other CPM leaders have started coming out. Now, at least the CPM cannot runaway from the responsibility of the killing of Shuhaib. 
 
 He reiterated that the CPM cadres who were out on parole from   jail have close links with the murder. But the police are not ready to investigate into this due to political pressure.
