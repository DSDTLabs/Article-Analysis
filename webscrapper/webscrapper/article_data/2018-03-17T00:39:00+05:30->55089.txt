Police have found that the 45-year-old man found dead on the highway in Dharmapuri on February 27 was murdered by his wife and son to get the life insurance money worth several lakhs.

 The woman strangulated to death her husband Madeshan, a textile trader from Nethaji Nagar in Periyampatti near Karimangalam, and dumped the body on the highway with the help of her lover and his aides.
 
 Police have nabbed Madeshan’s wife Revathi, son Yogesh, her lover Jayaprakash and his two friends in connection with the murder. “Yogesh had sought the postmortem report. We felt it was unusual for the family to seek the same since none of them had raised any doubt about the death. So we interrogated him and he spilled the beans,’’ said a police officer.
 
 Madeshan was found dead on Dharmapuri-Krishnagiri highway on February 27. Since his body was on the road with several injuries, it was initially assumed as an accident. But the police had their suspicion and started probing if it was a murder.
 
 Two days ago, Yogesh had gone to the government hospital demanding the postmortem report of his father. When the police inquired the reason, he said the insurance company was asking for same to process the life insurance claim. “We grew more suspicious and inquired Yogesh as well as Revathi. They then confessed to the crime,” an investigating official said. The younger son of Madhesan was, however, unaware of the conspiracy, the official added.
 
 Revathi told the police that there were two life insurance policies, one worth Rs 10 lakh and another Rs 45 lakh in the name of Madhesan. Revathi was the nominee in both the policies. tnn
