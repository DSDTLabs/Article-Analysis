 “We start at 3:30am with an aim to pedal at least 120km. It’s difficult in the high temperatures but the thought of saving   lifts our spirit,,” said Faizal. Murthy added, “We have faced problems, but after completing 1,800km, we are prepared mentally more than physically for the rest of the journey.” 
 
 The duo expressed gratitude for the encouragement received in the city. They have also created a Facebook page to reach out to maximum people.
 
 Ajay Kamble, an AEO volunteer, said, “The   are carrying a message of utmost importance.” Another volunteer Vikas Bemarkar said, “As responsible citizens we too should use cycles for a day. This will help to reduce pollution to a great extent. We at AEO commute by cycles at least twice a week.”
