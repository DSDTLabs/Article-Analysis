The pre-match menu will include fruits and nuts, low-fat smoothies, whole wheat brown bread sandwich, sprouts, beans, eggs and much more. After the match, the players will be served soup without cream, green salads with dressing and the main course will include non-oily vegetable curries along with steamed or grilled options in non-veg. “We have been instructed to keep food light considering the weather and heath routines of the players. Everything served to them will either have no oil or very little olive oil,” said Samee. The players will be at the stadium much before the match begins so they will be served fresh fruits at regular intervals. KXIP has tied up with a local fruit box vendor for this. A source let in that the diced fruits will be served in crystal glasses to players.

 “The fruit glass will contain more seasonal fruits and some continental fruits, like Kiwi. Fruits were served to the players during practice sessions as well. Each glass has been designed to hold 200-250 calories only,” said Hardeep Singh, owner of the fruit supplying firm. Fruits like watermelon, muskmelon, grapes, oranges, papaya are favourites this summer. These fruits have been treated with ozone technology that removes microorganisms and toxins that contaminate fruits during farming, processing and distribution, said sources. tnn
