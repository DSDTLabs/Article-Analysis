NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court sought a response on Monday from the National Human Rights Commission, to be submitted within a month, on the need for a stand-alone   and brushed aside the Centre’s ploy to dissuade judicial intervention in the issue by terming it a legislative exercise.

 A PIL by ex-law minister and Congress member   sought a direction to the government to enact a stand-alone law to punish police for custodial torture.
 
 Solicitor general Ranjit Kumar said   had already taken note of the issue and was taking steps in this regard. When he said the court should not get into the matter relating to legislative exercise, a bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar, Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice L N Rao said: “It is a matter relating to Article 21 (Right to Life). Tell us your response in the reply affidavit.”
 
 Kumar said his repeated attempts during the UPA government to get “The Prevention of Torture Bill, 2010” enacted had failed. The bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on May 6, 2010 and in the   it was referred to a 13-member committee headed by Kumar. The Committee recommended a comprehensive law to prevent custodial torture. But it did not get passed in the RS.
 
 The petition said the issue of escalating custodial violence remained unaddressed primarily because of lack of comprehensive legal regime. Kumar’s PIL said the   adopted the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 1984 and it was brought into force in June 1987. 
 
 Non-signing of the convention has cost India dear as a Danish court refused to facilitate the extradition of Kim Davy, a prime accused in the Purulia arms drop case on the ground that he might face torture in the hands of Indian police.
 
  has registered 2,044 cases of torture in police custody of which 574 were in 2008-09, 615 in 2009-10 and 855 in 2010-11, Kumar said citing a 2011 report by Asian Centre for Human Rights.
