Thirty-six years after it first won the hearts of Kannada audiences, the My Lord song is all set to make a comeback, albeit in a new avatar.

 The song — picturised on Dr   and   in the 1982 film   — is being recreated for Dr Rajkumar's grandson,  's upcoming film, Ananthu V/S Nusrath. Since   is a lawyer in the film, the song only seems fitting.
 
 It will be interesting to see how the song has taken shape in its new avatar and how Vinay does justice to his legendary grandfather's hit number.
