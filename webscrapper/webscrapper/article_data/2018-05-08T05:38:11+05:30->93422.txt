Following the Bombay high court’s recent order, private schools across the state have decided to admit students allotted to them under the   ( ) Act quota of 2009.

 The local civic bodies, which had put the admission process on hold due to a deadlock between schools and the state government, may be able to restart it only after the end of the vacation.
 
 In an order issued on April 24, the high court stated that the schools cannot refuse to abide by the mandate of law and must admit students according to the list furnished by the education department. “In the event of failure of the school to abide by the mandate, it would be open for the competent authority to take appropriate steps as permissible in law,” read the order.
 
 All unaided non-minority schools in the country have to reserve 25% of their seats at the entry level for students from economically weaker sections. Several schools this year have however not agreed to complete the admission process due to a dispute with the government over unsettled RTE reimbursements for the past five years.
 
 “The state has in the high court also assured that the payments will be made accordingly and in the best interest of the children, we have started the admissions,” said Rajendra Singh of Maharashtra English Medium Schools Trustees Association, one of the groups participating in the protest.
 
 The delay however might cost parents and students dearly as the   education department might not be able to hold the further rounds of admission immediately. “The next round of admissions can’t be started without the backlog of the first round is cleared. Also, with schools on vacation, we aren’t able to get that done. We have also written to the state to allow us to block the pending seats and continue with the process but we are awaiting instructions,” said a senior BMC official.
 
 In round one, while over 3,200 students were allotted a seat, only 2,050 admissions were confirmed.
