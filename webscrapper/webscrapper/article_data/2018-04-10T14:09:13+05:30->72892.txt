SURAT: A 20-year-old   was booked at Varachha police station on Sunday for submitting his school leaving certificate with fake date of birth twice to the   (SMC). The accused, who had not attained the legal age for marriage, which is 21, changed his date of birth and got two marriages registered since 2016. 

 He separated from his first wife whom he married after a brief affair and recently got married to another girl. The girl’s father was against the marriage ever since he came to know about the past of the accused. He lodged a police complaint of forgery on coming to know about the accused having submitted fake certificate for registration of marriage.
 
 The police have booked Vimal Dholariya, a resident of Varachha, on a complaint from a diamond polisher   (name changed) who lives in Ahmedabad. Dholariya was booked under various Sections of the India Penal Code, including 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for cheating) and 471 (using forged document as genuine).
 
 The accused got married to Patel’s daughter despite being a year younger than the permissible age of 21 years for marriage in India. Patel’s daughter got married to Dholariya against her father’s wish. Patel came to know that Dholariya had married another girl in 2016 and got the marriage registered in central zone office of SMC. He had then submitted school leaving certificate with fake date of birth, which showed him to be 21 years of age. 
 
 Dholariya got married again in February 2018 to Patel’s daughter and this time submitted school leaving certificate with another date of birth in east zone office of SMC. 
 
 “We have registered statements of a few individuals who are connected with the case. We will register statement of the accused and arrest him,” the police said.
