Madurai: Students should undertake tree planting and rainwater harvesting as their responsibility towards society to manage climate change and water crisis, vice-chancellor of Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU), P P Chellathurai has urged outgoing graduates of the American College after conferring degrees to them on Saturday.

 Delivering his convocation address, Chellathurai said that MKU, along with academics has undertaken various community outreach programmes like planting trees, adopting villages, identifying talent in these villages and grooming them. Likewise, graduates too should take up tasks contributing to the society. He advised the graduates to pursue a career of choice against chance which requires lot of hard work and sharpening of their skills. 
 
 Chellathurai urged them to do things differently and better than others considered difficult or impossible. “All of you need not be job seekers all the time but also job makers because you have high potential under the flagship programme ‘Make in India’ launched by the Prime Minster of India. God has given us two hands, right hand is for self-development and left is for society development,” he said. 
 
 About 457 undergraduates, 203 postgraduates and 66 MPhil scholars were awarded their degrees. Principal, Dr M Davamani Christober welcomed the gathering and briefed about the college.
