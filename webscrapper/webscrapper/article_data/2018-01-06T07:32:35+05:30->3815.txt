GURUGRAM: The annual ratio of female births to male in the district has crossed the 900 mark for the first time in a decade. The overall   for 2017 has been reported at 901, which is a 2% increase from the previous year. The sex ratio was 883 in 2016 and 875 in 2015. The highest sex ratio in the district was reported from Bhangrola, and the maximum births were reported from the Gurgaon city zone (14,909).

 A total of 27,665 children were born in the district in 2017, including 14,551 boys and 13,114 girls. The highest sex ratio in 2017 was reported from the primary health centre (PHC) in Bhangrola village, IMT Manesar (1,089). The lowest sex ratio, meanwhile, was reported from Narnaul (850).
 
 The district administration said it has been taking measures to ensure a better sex ratio with a strict crackdown on female foeticide. “This is a big achievement for Gurgaon. The health workers from rural sectors and in the field of gynaecology helped us identify illegal clinics where sex determination and termination of pregnancy was being conducted. We have taken steps against them,” said Dr B K Rajora, chief medical officer, Gurgaon.
 
  
  
 
 Haryana, which was among the bottom rankers on the sex ratio table in the 2011 Census, embarked on a major course correction with Prime Minister   launching the ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ campaign in 2015.
 
 The latest numbers have come as a relief to officials in Gurgaon, considering the awkward situation that arose after discrepancies were revealed in sex ratio data reported by various districts in the state in 2017. The data of multiple districts came under the scanner, the worst being Palwal and Mahendergarh. Two officials in Palwal’s municipal corporation were suspended for fudging data. TOI had reported that a gardener-cum-peon was compiling the data in Palwal. In Mahendergarh, a clerical error had reversed the numbers for boys and girls.
 
 Officials said all the numbers had been rectified. The chief minister had also lauded the performance of the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao team for reporting birth of 950 girls for 1,000 boys in March 2017. The same now stands corrected to 930 for the state.
 
 For Gurgaon, the number, though significant, is not a surprise since the sex ratio has been steadily improving since 2010 when it was 841 girls per 1,000 boys.
