 In response to the article published in TOI on May 19, 2018, ‘Kudachi rly station lacks basic amenities’, South Western Railways ( ) public relations officer Pranesh K clarified that, “Kudachi is an NSG-5 (earlier ‘D’) category railway station. It caters to an average of 3,100 passengers per day and around 11 pairs of trains are dealt on a given day at this railway station. As per Railway Board norms, all the requisite passenger amenities at this station, based on its category, have been provided.
 
 In the previous summer, as experienced in most parts of North Karnataka, there has been an acute shortage of drinking water at this station, mainly due to drying up of the Krishna River. To combat this problem, Railway administration has provided borewells which caters to the need of drinking water. Although tube lights are provided, in recent rains and thunderstorms, some of these lights were damaged and they were repaired immediately.
 
 Further, once the station gets the status of 'junction' on commissioning of Bagalkot-Kudachi railway line, additional amenities will be augmented at this station.
 
 “Though all the essential amenities are provided by Railways, there have been several cases of vandalism by miscreants, especially theft of water taps from pedestals, damaging of benches, leaving such amenities defunct. As SWR cares for the comfort of its passengers, the defunct amenities at   railway station will once again be set right after a thorough inspection. We also appeal to our passengers to use railway amenities with care and avoid vandalism, which ultimately causes inconvenience to travelling public,” said Pranesh.
