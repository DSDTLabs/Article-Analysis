PATNA: The   (JPNI) Airport, Patna, registered 29.9% growth in passenger flow between April and September last year, according to the latest   (AAI) report.

 As per the AAI figures,   handled 15,23,395 passengers between April and December, 2016 against 11,72,566 during the same period previous year. In terms of monthly passenger movement, it handled 1,86,704 flyers in December last year against 1,32,292 in the same month in 2015.
 
 Senior Patna airport officials attribute the increase in passenger traffic to more flights and low airfare. “Around 10 flights operated from Patna airport in 2012-13. The number has now increased to 23 and is likely to reach 26 in March and 32 flights by June. The airfare on various sectors have also come down recently, making it well within the reach of flyers. Besides, a large chunk of floating population in Bihar keeps flying from Patna airport,” JPNI Airport director   told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 The airport officials claimed around 7,000 footfalls at the terminal building stands daily, whereas the total seating capacity in the passenger holding area is not more than 1000. It is in acknowledgement of the paucity of space in the terminal building that the state government and the AAI are working on its expansion plan.
 
 The Union cabinet, chaired by PM Narendra Modi on January 24, nodded the transfer of 11.35 acres of AAI land in Anisabad to Bihar government, which has agreed to transfer 13 acres of its land where the state hangar and   (IOC) depot exist and 6.5 acre owned by Special Task Force (STF) adjacent to the airport to develop a two-storey swanky terminal building equipped with aerobridges.
 
 Lahauria said the land is scheduled to be transferred on February 28 and expansion work of the terminal building is expected to start in June-July.
