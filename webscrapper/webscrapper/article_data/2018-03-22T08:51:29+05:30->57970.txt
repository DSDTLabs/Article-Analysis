NEW DELHI: Gangster   and 20 others have gone on a hunger strike at the high-security   to press for   similar to those enjoyed by fellow inmate  . Sources said that Rajan not only has a television in his cell, but can also avail other special amenities. Bawana and gangster-turned-politician   had protested the special treatment given to the underworld done a week ago too.

 Jail sources said that Bawana’s father, Prem, had recently approached court on the issue of equal rights for all prisoners. In response, the court asked Tihar jail authorities to explain by March 22 why special facilities were being forwarded to one individual.
 
 Bawana and Rajan were both lodged in Jail No 2 at Tihar, but after intelligence inputs about a   conspiracy to kill his rival Rajan with the help of the former, the jail authorities had shifted Bawana to another cell.
 
 The jailed gangster’s father claimed in court that that while Rajan was kept back in Jail No 2 and provided heavy security, Bawana was sent to a solitary confinement. The jail authorities refuted this and said Bawana was not kept in solitary confinement, only shifted to a high-security cell.
 
 In its plea to the court, Bawana’s family defended the demand of the gangster and Shahabuddin for better facilities in the high-security prison. According to them, Rajan is not only being provided with a television, but also gets books and newspapers as per demand. However, when they approached senior jail officers with requests for similar facilities for Bawana, they were rebuffed. The jail authorities also denied that Rajan was being given special treatment.
 
 Copies of the court application, moved through advocate M S Khan, have been sent to the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court and Delhi high court and to the director-general, Prisons.
