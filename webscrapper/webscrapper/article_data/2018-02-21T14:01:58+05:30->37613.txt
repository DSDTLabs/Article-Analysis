PATNA: The   (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister  , has approved Rs 2,729.10 crore for the doubling of 100.6km-long Muzaffarpur-Sagauli and 109.7km-long Sagauli-Valmiki Nagar rail lines and their electrification. While Rs 1,347.61 crore will be spent on doubling of tracks, Rs 1,381.49 will be utilised for the electrification work.

 These projects will cover Muzaffarpur, East Champaran and   districts, a press release issued by the Patna office of PIB said on Tuesday. “Areas served by this route are densely populated ones. Currently, passenger trains suffer congestion and stoppages on   route as the line capacity utilization is up to 213%. Altogether 38 mail and express trains are running on this section with thousands of passengers travelling daily. Additional capacity will ease congestion and allow faster and reliable movement with minimum delays. In addition, it will enhance safety through more availability of maintenance blocks,” the release added.
 
 In addition to decongesting the entire route from Muzaffarpur to Valmiki Nagar, doubling of rail lines will improve capacity and connectivity, thus paving way for economic prosperity and overall development of the region. “Development of eastern regions of the country is important for achieving the ‘New India’ vision of the Prime Minister by 2022. Champaran region is on the border with Nepal and doubling of the rail line will lead to better connectivity with neighbouring country as well,” the release said, adding electrification will lead to faster trains, reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable environment. “It will also reduce fuel import dependence and result in energy cost savings for Railways,” it said.
