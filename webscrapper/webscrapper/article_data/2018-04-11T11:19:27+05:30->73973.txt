CUTTACK: Seven years since it was proposed, a   (NHAI) project to set up truck parking lots between   and Bhubaneswar remains a non-starter. The   said the work had not started because of encroachment of land at the site of the project. 

 "Nothing has been done. Hundreds of trucks are parked by the side of the highway, causing traffic jams and inconveniencing commuters. I return home late from Bhubaneswar every night. It takes me around two hours to cover the journey, thanks to traffic congestion on the NH16. Earlier, it would take me only 40 minutes," said Sushant Panda, an employee of a hotel in Bhubaneswar.
 
 Every day, more than 15,000 trucks use the NH16 between Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. "With both sides of the national highway packed with trucks, driving at night is scary," Panda added.
 
 Trucks are parked on the NH16 at various points such as Palasuni, Rudrapur, Phul Nakhra, Pahala, Pratap Nagari, Sikharpur, Jagatpur and Manguli. "Not only at night, things are difficult even during the day," said another commuter,  .
 
 "We have discussed the problem with the NHAI and the transport department several times. Letters have been written and appeals made but to no avail," said  , secretary of the  . "We are forced to park the vehicles by the side of the road as there is no proper parking place. The NHAI should finish the work as soon as possible," he added.
 
 NHAI project director Biju Patri acknowledged the delay and said, "We have around 30 acres of land near the NH16 between Cuttack and Bhubaneswar but some of it is encroached upon. We will carry out an eviction drive this month to rid the land of settlers. After that, we will begin work and the parking lots will be ready by the end of this year," added Patri.
