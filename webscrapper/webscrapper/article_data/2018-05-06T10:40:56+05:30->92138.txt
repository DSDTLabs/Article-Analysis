BELAGAVI: BS Yeddyurappa’s instruction to his partymen on how to get people not supporting BJP to vote in favour of the party candidate has sparked off a controversy.

 
 At a public rally on Saturday at MK Hubli village in   assembly constituency where the party has fielded Mahantesh Dodagoudar,   said: “Yaru matadararu namage mata kodolla nimage annisutto, avara kai kalu katti Mahantesh Doddagoudar avaranta olle vykatiyanne gello haage maadi.”
 
 It literally translates as, “Tie the hands of those who you think will not vote for BJP and ensure a gentleman like Mahantesh wins.” But colloquially, it means workers should fall at the feet of voters if need be and get Mahantesh elected. However, the remarks set off a row as the literal translation did the rounds.

 Taking a dig at Congress, Yeddyurappa said it has divided the state into three factions of Siddaramaiah, G Parameshwara and  . He dared   to bring them all on a single dais if possible. He also said Congress is a sinking ship.
 
 BJP state vice-president KP Nanjundi, MP Suresh Angadi and MLA   were present.
