PANAJI: Bharatiya Janata Party core committee on Saturday held a meeting with independent candidates   Gaude and   from Priol and   constituencies, signalling that the party is likely to support the duo in the upcoming assembly elections.

 BJP blocks in Priol and Navelim have raised strong demands that the party field its own candidates in both constituencies. A meeting is likely to be held with the blocks before taking a final decision in the matter.
