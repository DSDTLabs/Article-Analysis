NEW DELHI:   is reportedly keen on   leading India when they face Afghanistan in a one-off Test that starts from June 14 which means he will have to either skip or alter his plans to play county cricket in England.

 
 
 
 Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) is keen on getting India Test specialists a hang of the English conditions before the team embarks on a tour of England which include five Tests, three ODIs and as many T20Is. 
 
 But BCCI feels that should Kohli decide to give the Afghanistan Test a miss, it will tantamount to disrespecting their opponent and also set a bad precedent. 
 
 "If a decision has been taken to allow the India captain to miss an international game and play County cricket at that point of time, it would set a very bad precedent," the daily quoted an unnamed BCCI official as saying. "It would give a very bad message to the visiting Afghanistan team; that maybe the opponents arenâ€™t worthy for us. It would be disrespectful to the Afghanistan team and also, it would be unfair on the broadcaster. (Even if) he is playing in England at that time, he can come back for one Test and then fly back. And if he is so keen to play County cricket, has he sought permission to miss his   games?"
  
 TOI had earlier reported that the CoA wanted Indian cricketers to spend time in the county championship or play India A matches before the start of England tour.
