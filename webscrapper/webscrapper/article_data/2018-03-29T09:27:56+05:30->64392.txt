LUCKNOW: Expressing satisfaction over a productive assembly session, Speaker   on Wednesday said that members of Opposition parties had regretted their unruly behaviour with Governor   during his joint address on the first day of the budget session. 

 Addressing a press conference on the last day of the session, he told reporters that since the Opposition members have apologised, that chapter had been closed. The session that started on February 8, was adjourned sine die on Wednesday. 
 
 With 61 sittings in this session, this was the longest session in the recent period, he said, adding " important bills like   were passed during the session."
 
 Dixit expressed his satisfaction that both the treasury as well as the opposition thoroughly discussed issues related to the public importance that included agriculture, power, law and order and development .
 
 It was for the first time that members from Opposition did not troop into the well of the House to vent their grievances during the entire session as the Speaker had warned that if they would do so their issues would not be heard. Another highlight of the budget session was that   allowed first-timers and young members to speak and air their views.
