Ahmedabad: Today’s students are more exposed to subjects than those studying 10 years ago thanks to internet and smart phones. Engaging them is an uphill task even for good teachers. For teachers, the set of problems start with textbook-based learning especially for practice-based subjects such as chemistry. These were some of the issues that came to fore on the first day of the two-day orientation workshop at Science City for a group of 35 chemistry teachers from across the state.

 The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), a UK-based chemistry community, has joined hands with GUJCOST and Science City to impart a first of its kind training programme. Two expert trainers Manorema Ramdas and Jaya Swaminathan from the RSC engaged the teachers on a number of topics on Thursday.
 
 “Our focus is to provide a well-rounded method which is both effective and engaging for students such as integrating elements of games and group activities while teaching chemistry. The teachers are also trained in using available material for experiments,” said Ramdas.
 
 Swaminathan said that now the teachers have to play the role of mentors and enhancing their understanding of the subject. “Our focus should be to develop a good foundation of subject understanding in students right from the early classes,” she said.
 
 Over the course of workshop, the teachers will be given inputs on online resources available and how to use them effectively. “There will also be hands-on demonstrations, carrying out simple experiments related to the syllabus, which may even be carried out in the classroom on a micro-scale,” said an organizer.
