BENGALURU: In a bonusfor the   ( ), the   ( ) has reduced tariff by Re 1 per unit, but this is unlikely to be passed on to   commuters.

 
 Until Monday, BMRCL paid Rs 6 per unit of electricity consumed, but that will now be reduced to Rs 5 with retrospective effect from April1.
 
 Mahendra Jain, managing director, BMRCL, revealed Namma Metro expends about Rs 5.5 crore on electricity and the reduction will save the company about Rs 65 lakh per month, considering Namma Metro uses about 65 lakh units of electricity every month.
 
 “The tariff reduction is very welcome,” Jain said. “It is an environment-friendly move to incentivise electricbased mobility solutions. Our operational expenses are rising mainly on account of higher security, higher staff costs, longer operational hours during off-peak hours, apart from others.”
 
 Asked if passenger fares would be reduced, Jain said, “Revision of fares is deliberated by the audit committee of the board and decided with the approval of the board and the government. So any proposal for fare revision has to be decided at the appropriate level. However, keeping in mind our overall financial situation, and considering that our fares are fairly competitive, there is no proposal to revise the fares at present.”
 
 KERC has reduced tariff for regular suburban electric trains by 40 paise per unit. It aims to encourage electrification in public transport and reduce carbon emissions.
