AHMEDABAD: Thanks to a  , a person escaped imprisonment for six months even after the   had upheld his  

 Ankleshwar-resident, Nimesh Hajariwala, got away with just a small fine because his case papers were not available to the high court to hear his appeal. The case papers were destroyed by a court in Bharuch in 2012.
 
 In this case, Hajariwala’s grocery shop was raided and rotting jaggery was found from his shop in 1997. He was booked for violation of the Bombay Prohibition Act because jaggery was stored for making country liquor. A magisterial court in Ankleshwar held him guilty and punished him with six-month jail term and Rs 1,000 fine.
 
 A sessions court in Bharuch upheld Hajariwala’s conviction in 2002 after which he moved the high court. His appeal was pending since then. When the high court took up his appeal for hearing in 2017, it noticed that the court records pertaining to the case were not called earlier.
 
 When the high court asked the lower court to send the case papers, the Bharuch court informed the HC that the documents were destroyed in 2012 as per the norm that case papers had to be destroyed after 10 years of the end of proceedings. The high court was helpless.
 
 The high court observed that the lower courts had not discussed much on the evidence placed before them and their orders were lacking proper reasoning. However, the high court upheld the lower courts’ orders but in the absence of the case papers, it could not hear much on the case.
 
 On Wednesday, the high court finally decided to spare Hajariwala the jail term but he has been asked to pay the fine of Rs 1,000.
