PUNE: The   is visited by four to five lakh devotees each year during  . The crowd brings with it a large amount of  , which is a major   as the shrine is located in a sanctuary and can upset a delicate ecological balance. 

 Located on the edge of the eponymous wildlife sanctuary in Ambegaon and Khed talukas of the district, Bhimashankar is one of the 12 ‘Jyotirlingas’ found across the country. It holds an important place for worshippers of Lord Shiva. Devotees throng to the shrine carrying offerings of coconuts and flowers in plastic bags. These bags are then dumped after the offering, and can flow downstream with the river Bhima located near the temple, across the 130 sq km sanctuary.
 
 Chief conservator of forests (CCF) – wildlife wing, Pune, KP Singh said that the temple is located near the edge of the sanctuary. “Due to its location, the crowd at the temple does not directly interact with other parts of the sanctuary premises. Our own staff as well as that from local administration manages the visitors every year. They ensure that the devotees do not dump any waste along the route,” he said.
 
 Range Forest Officer (RFO) Tushar Dhamdhere explained how they are doing their best to convert this waste into something useful. “Over the last 6 months, as much as 500 kg of plastic waste collected from the sanctuary by our team as well as citizens has been given to a Pune-based organisation which is converting the same into polyfuel. This polyfuel is a clean source of energy for villagers living around the sanctuary,” he said.
 
 However forest fires still remain a major concern, “During the dry summer months, chances of forest fires are very high. Hence, volunteers from our staff, NGOs, village eco-development communities (VEDCs) ensure that no burning cigarettes, beedis or other inflammable material are dumped by the visitors,” the official said.
