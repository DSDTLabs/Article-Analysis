When we contacted 
  
  star   prior to the   festival on what his plans were, he said the following: Every year, around 4 generations of our families from the elders to toddlers meet in Bengaluru at a farmhouse which belongs to   garu. We would spend the three days of the festival there. But this year, Chiranjeevi garu, Bunny ( ) and Charan (Ram Charan) are all busy with their shootings. So, it’s going to be a family dinner or something of that sort in Hyderabad. To me, Sankranthi in Hyderabad means a deserted city…..(laughs ) but it just goes to show how many people from across the country have contributed to its development and made this wonderful city, their home. But, since I grew up in Chennai, I remember the days when as a youngster, during Bhogi, I used to purchase the ‘Dappu’ and try my hand at it. I also remember feeding cows and paying their owners on Mattu Pongal, the third day of the festival. “

 On the other hand, Sirish is quite pleased with the response to 
  
  which he says is his best work to date. “The credit for this goes entirely to director  . I have grown as an actor under him and hope to work with him in future as well.”
