New Delhi: The AAP government on Monday told the   that the lieutenant governor has approved the extension of benefits of semi-open and open prisons to women convicts as well.

 A bench of acting Chief justice Gita Mittal and C Hari Shankar took the submission on record and disposed of a PIL that had sought the quashing of guidelines which excluded women prisoners from semi-open and open prisons. The PIL had alleged discrimination by the authorities as women were denied the facility available for men inmates.
 
 The AAP government told the court that the LG, Anil Baijal, had approved the amendment to the existing guidelines and the notification in this regard has been issued with immediate effect.
 
 The governmentâ€™s submission came on a petition filed by advocate Sunil Gupta, former law officer of Tihar Jail, seeking setting up of a special semi-open and an open prison for women inside Delhi prisons in a time-bound manner.
 
 A semi-open or open prison allows convicts to work outside the jail premises, earn a livelihood and return by evening. The concept, adopted by jail authorities across the country, was brought in to assimilate convicts with society and instill confidence in them to help lead normal lives outside the prison. 
 
 The plea claimed that the guidelines in selection criteria denied the facility to women without any rationale or justification. Gupta also alleged the guidelines violated the fundamental right to equality of women prisoners.
