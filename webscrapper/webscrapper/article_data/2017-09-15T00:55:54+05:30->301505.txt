NEW DELHI: The   ( ) on Thursday dismissed the Centre’s   seeking modification of their order banning 10-year-old diesel vehicles in Delhi NCR, saying that emissions from diesel vehicles were still quite harmful and equivalent to the emissions of 24 petrol vehicles. The order means 10-year-old diesel vehicles in Delhi NCR will now have to go off the roads.

 A bench headed by Justice Swatanter Kumar said that the tribunal had noted emissions from diesel vehicles were highly carcinogenic in nature and quoted a CPCB study which said that one diesel vehicle was equivalent to 24 petrol cars or 84 CNG vehicles on the road.
 
 “The report speaks loudly, that it (diesel) is the most harmful of the exhaust emissions, which releases particulate emission that are carcinogenic. Thus, the contention that there will be reduction of carbon dioxide levels by use of diesel is not a positive factor in favour of use of diesel as fuel,” the order said.
 
 NGT also noted that the   has also junked a similar plea and said that the ministry of road transport and highways which had sought modification in the NGT’s April, 2015 order had failed to provide that 10-year old diesel vehicles will not be harmful to people.
 
 The tribunal also further refused to agree with the ministry’s submission that the order banning 10-year old diesel vehicles was in violation of the motor vehicles act, 1988. It said that since the government had failed to discharge its statutory obligation, NGT could not be a ‘silent spectator’ and let the citizens suffer. The tribunal also added that degradation in air quality had required action from them.
