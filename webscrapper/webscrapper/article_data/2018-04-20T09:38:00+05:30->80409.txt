CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday issued notice to the Haryana government on a plea seeking probe into the credentials of persons availing  , old age pension and widow pension in the state. Petitioner  , a resident of Bhawar village in Sonipat district, has claimed that 39 people in his village were found to be availing disability pension, though none of them was disabled.

 The petitioner had lodged a complaint with the director general, department of   and empowerment, giving names of some persons of his village, who were getting disability pension, though they were not having any disability. An inquiry was conducted by the department found that 39 persons of his village were getting disability pension for last several years, some from July 2006, and some from January 2011, the rate of which stood increased to Rs 1,800 per month from November 2017, but none of them could produce any document, or medical certificate to prove their disability.
 
 Their disability pension aggregating to Rs 39.42 lakh from 39 persons of his village is being recovered, similarly an amount of Rs 4.42 lakh for other pensions is being recovered from five other beneficiaries of his village. A departmental inquiry for imposing major penalty proceedings was ordered against a clerk of the district office, for approving such pension, but even that inquiry has not been started so far.
 
 The counsel for the petitioner argued that if so many ineligible persons are beneficiaries of such type of social security pensions in one village alone, the magnitude of the fraud and resultant loss to state exchequer all over the state can be beyond imagination. Presumably, vote bank politics does not permit the government to order such inquiry on its own, argued the counsel seeking directions to conduct probe.
 
 The matter would now come up for hearing on July 3.
