Nagpur: Controversies in Nagbhid forest range under Bramhapuri division fails to stop. On Monday, dumping of meat near Bamhni village in the range caused flutter among local residents.

 Sources said panic gripped villagers when a section of them found six sacks filled with meat dumped in bushes on the roadside nullah. The spot is 4km away from where Srinivas (T10) was electrocuted. Electrocution of wild animals is rampant in the rice belt.
 
 “Initially, we suspected it to be a case of murder, but after opening one of the bags, it was found to be animal meat,” said villagers.
 
 The meat, around 250kg, was filled in empty plastic sacks of fertilizers. “Villagers suspect it to be meat of some wild animal and must have been dumped by poachers,” forest department sources said.
 
 Nagbhid RFO RM Talande denied that the meat was of wild animals. “We had sent our men at the spot and found that the meat was basically intestines of some domestic animal,” said Talande.
 
 However, villagers said it was meat as dogs were feasting on it. The policemen who visited the spot too did not collect any samples to verify the facts.
 
 Villagers said forest officials, who should have collected samples for forensic tests, left the matter to police and did not take any cognisance.
 
 Nagbhid PI BD Madavi did not respond to the repeated calls made to him. Police station staff admitted no action has been taken in the matter.
