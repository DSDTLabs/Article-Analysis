HYDERABAD: A joint action committee (JAC) of Telangana contract lecturers on Friday laid siege to Gandhi Bhavan, Congress headquarters at Nampally here in the city, demanding that the party withdraw a case it had filed in high court on the issue of regularisation of their jobs.

 The agitators alleged Congress was speaking in two voices. While the party has filed a case in the court, it was preventing the government from taking a final decision on regularisation of their jobs and on the other, it says it was in support of the contract lecturers demand for regularisation of their job.
 
 They, however, called off their agitation after a couple of hours following an assurance from the party that it was with the lecturers and supported their demand. “The Congress party leaders at Gandhi Bhavan assured that they are with us in this fight. We had to stage this protest because a representative of Congress was playing a double game with us. But, now Congress made it clear that it had nothing to do with Rai and extended its full support,” said  , president of the contract lecturers association. 
 
 Meanwhile, the   (TPCC) on Friday accused the ruling   of instigating contract lecturers to lodge a protest against the Congress. Reacting strongly to the protest by a group of contract lecturers outside Gandhi Bhavan here, TPCC vice-president   alleged that the police ‘backed’ the agitating lecturers. He said the contract lecturers should have agitated outside the TRS office or the state Secretariat as the ruling party had failed to fulfil its pre-poll promise to regularise their services.
 
 “The lecturers have fallen into a TRS trap. The state should be blamed for the problems. The government has neither regularised their services nor issued guidelines. The Congress is in favour of regularisation of their service. In fact, the Congress manifesto had supported the lecturers’ demand,” Ravi said. The Congress leader alleged that CM was behind the agitation.
