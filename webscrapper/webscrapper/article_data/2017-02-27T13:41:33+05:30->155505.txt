 "I spend roughly Rs 3,000 per day on nine-year-old Yuvraj's food. The money which I earn from Yuvraj helps my family to keep my other cattle in better condition. I could have charged more than Rs 500 for a single dose, but I deliberately keep the price low as I want to carry on with this business as a social service," added Karamvir.
