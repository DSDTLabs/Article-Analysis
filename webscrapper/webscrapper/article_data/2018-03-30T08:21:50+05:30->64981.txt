BENGALURU: Passengers reaching the   (KIA) could soon meet a   offering airport directions and information on Karnataka’s tourist places.

 Tourism minister Priyank Kharge on Thursday said the humanoid, named KEMPA, built on artificial intelligence by Bengaluru-based startup Sirena Technologies is being tested for deployment at KIA. “KEMPA will give information on various tourist places in the state and interact with passengers in Kannada as well,” he said.
 
 A 1.19-minute video posted by Kharge on Twitter shows KEMPA talking in Kannada and English. It also suggests places to visit in the state and also engages in casual conversation with passengers.
 
 Kharge said Sirena Technologies is one of the startups that benefited from the government’s startup policy. “We’ve created an environment for startups to come up with innovations. This humanoid is completely made in Bengaluru,” he said.
 
 It is also expected to provide visitors with check-in information and directions at airport. 
 
 In foreign countries, humanoid robots are commonly seen assisting passengers. Lufthansa Airline and Munich Airport have recently introduced a humanoid robot in Terminal 2 for check-ins, scanning passengers’ baggages and issuing boarding passes.
