Surat: The city police have booked father of the five-year-old girl, who died after manja slit her throat, for causing death due to negligence. Khatodara police also named an unidentified person in the complaint.

 The girl Fatima was standing in the sunroof of the car on December 31 when a manja slit her throat.
 
 Police booked her father Yunus, a resident of Hathuran village in Mangrol taluka and an unidentified person, who was flying the kite. They were booked under the Indian Penal Code Section 304A (causing death by negligence) Section 269 (negligence) 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and under Motor Vehicle Act for dangerous driving.
 
 “Father has been booked as the girl was standing dangerously in car’s sunroof. Any person inside a moving car should be seated with a seat belt fastened,” deputy commissioner of police, zone II, Vidhi Chaudhary said.
 
 Police are yet to make any arrest in the case. The incident had happened when they were driving on the Udhna flyover. Fatima, who suffered severe injuries, was shifted to a nearby hospital, where she succumbed on Thursday. The cut was deep and long that doctors had to take 18 stitches in the neck to cover the wound. However, she died due to heavy blood loss as an important blood vessel was ruptured.
