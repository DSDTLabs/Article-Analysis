 Panvel RTO is stated to have developed 5 acres of plot as the testing track out of the 15 acres allotted by the state government. 
 
 As per the letter addressed to the deputy RTO on Tuesday, residents have asked the officials to conduct brake testing in Taloja. 
 
 “The plot allotted to Panvel RTO is ideal for brake testing as it is merely 9km away from the plot being developed in a residential area of Nerul. Instead of causing inconvenience to residents, the deputy RTO can seek from the transport department to permit them to use the test track constructed by Panvel RTO,” said local corporator Ithape.
