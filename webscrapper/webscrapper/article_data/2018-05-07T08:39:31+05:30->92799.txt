Ten years ago, on this date, we made a leap of faith as we entered   as tourists, nor to make Goa into a ‘state of mind’. We did not come to Goa for quick gains, but to share its heritage and aspirations and help to take both forward. Ten years later, The Times of India—a 175-year-old world leader—is here to stay, through good times and bad. We are proud and privileged to be associated with the poise and wisdom of Goans with which you straddle tradition and modernity.

 Over the past 10 years, The   has transformed itself in line with the changing needs of our readers, but our core values have remained constant. Our cornerstone: To serve our readers. We have also upheld our heritage, one which we are fiercely proud of. We have no political agenda, no political ideology and no political masters. We draw our strength from our readers, collectively and individually, who empower us to speak without fear or favour.
 
 
 As we embark on our next journey, we will continue to champion your causes, safeguarding and furthering the local agenda, with not just balanced news and incisive comments but stories of triumph of human spirit. Wherever you seek change, we will be your change agent. And it will be through a conversation, not a monologue.
 
 Our unflinching position has always been society above the state. Over the next 10 days, starting today, we will focus on 10 priority areas where Goa has made a mark but needs to do more, so that the dreams of Goans are realised.
 
 We have rejoiced in your good fortune and we have stood by you through your rough patches. But that is history. Together, we can be the custodians of the future and we promise you that as a loved friend who has your best interests at our heart, we will continue to tell your stories.
