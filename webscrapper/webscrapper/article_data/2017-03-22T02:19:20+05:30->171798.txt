NEW DELHI:   has asked its seven Delhi   to short-list five to six names of probable   for the municipal elections in consultation with the district teams. The names would be placed before the core committee and the four-member panel appointed by BJP chief Amit Shah for final approval, say sources. 

 This is for the first time BJP has not appointed a candidate selection committee. And the party has to rely completely on the MPs as there are only three BJP MLAs in Delhi and most of the sitting councillors are upset about not being repeated this time. But while AAP has announced most of its candidates and begun door-to-door campaigning, BJP is yet to start moving. 
 
 The party would have to complete the candidate selection process in the next few days as the nomination filing process, which starts from March 27, has to be completed by April 2. Sources said that some MPs met MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, who heads the managing committee, in this regard.
 
 “MPs are having a say in the candidate selection process, as the new team of councillors will be their main team during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” said a BJP functionary. In the 2015 assembly elections, the MPs weren’t given any key role. They had little say in the candidate selection process as well as the party had appointed 14 senior functionaries, including Union ministers, oversee poll preparations in different areas.
 
 “The party can’t afford to take a chance this time. This election is crucial for BJP. Though we have an advantage as the public mood is in our favour, the party has to fight strong anti-incumbency as it has been in power in municipal corporations for a decade,” said a BJP functionary.
 
 MPs say they want councillors who can deliver. They have serious issues with the functioning of the three corporations. Many of them have complained about their projects getting delayed due to the lackadaisical attitude of the three corporations.
