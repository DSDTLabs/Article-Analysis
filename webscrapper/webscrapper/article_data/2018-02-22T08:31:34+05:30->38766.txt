CENTURION:   clouted a 30-ball 69 as South Africa beat India by six wickets to level the T20I series 1-1 here on Wednesday. Set a challenging 189 to win, the hosts rode on Klaasen’s belligerent knock and skipper JP Duminy’s calculated 64 not out to romp home in 18.4 overs. Klaasen, who hit seven sixes, took legspinner Yuzvendra Chahal to the cleaners during the middle overs to put South Africa on the victory path.

 
 
 
 Earlier, in testing conditions, India rode on a 48-ball 79 from middle-order batsman   – who impressed with some commanding and innovative strokeplay – to wrap up at 188/4.
 
 Pandey took his time settling down after the top-order’s early departure, taking a good 12 balls for his first boundary. But once that happened, the right-hander began to look dismissive of the South African attack on a wicket they thought they had a chance. Pandey was particularly harsh on the unimaginative Tabraiz Shamsi, sweeping the bowler before he was taken out of the attack.
 
 
 
 
 At the other end,   – who’s struggled with the bat so far – found the onus back on him yet again to get the runs and this time the former skipper did manage a delightful 27-ball 51. The two batsmen put together a 98-run stand for the fifth wicket.
 
 Luck appeared to stay with the Indians too, with Pandey narrowly missing a run-out and Dhoni benefitting from inside-edges and a dropped catch. Encouraged by the loud cheers that followed, the wicketkeeper-batsman seemed to have rediscovered his mojo.
 
 The ball swung, fractionally better than the last few matches played at this venue, and South Africa knew they got it right when India lost their first three wickets cheaply. As against trying to bowl short and bounce out the Indians like last time, South Africa made corrections and eked out some results.
 
 It was a fuller one from   that got Rohit Sharma plumb in front of the wicket for a nought.
