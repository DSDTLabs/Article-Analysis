Mumbai: The   revenue and forest department has formally cleared the diversion of 1.28 hectares of private forest land for scripwriter Salim Khanâ€™s Panvel farmhouse. 

 The notification was issued on Monday. The clearance has been granted following an in-principle approval granted by the Union ministry of environment and forests last September. The land has been diverted for regularization of constructed bungalows, swimming pool with jacuzzi, road and laying of an underground water pipeline and electricity cable along the road and other allied purposes in Raigad district with certain conditions,
 
 The forest documents sourced by TOI show that the property was purchased by Khan at Vajapur, Panvel taluka, in July 1993. By 1995, Khan had constructed a bungalow at the site. Officials noted, while the project falls under the Matheran eco-sensitive zone, it was beyond the 10km distance from the Karnala sanctuary. Hence, it was recommended that under the   Private Forest (Acquisition) Act, 1975, Khan be declared as the legal owner of the land.
