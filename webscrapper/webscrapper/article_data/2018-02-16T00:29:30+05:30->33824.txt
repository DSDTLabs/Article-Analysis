Kadapa: In a special operation at Jaipur in Rajasthan on Thursday, the Kadapa district police of Andhra Pradesh arrested an international red sanders  .

 The accused was identified as Ashok Kumar Agarwal (57), the main associate of international   smuggler Ali Bhai of Indonesia. 
 
 Addressing a press conference, Kadapa SP Babujee Attada said the police raided Agarwalâ€™s godown and seized 164 red sanders logs and 44 red sanders idols weighing about 3 tonnes worth Rs 4 crore in the open market. 
 
 The kingpin has links with international smugglers in China, Dubai, Singapore, Nepal and Indonesia. In India, Ashok also has nexus with international red sanders smugglers in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. Attada claimed that Agarwal had confessed that he had smuggled over 1,000 tonnes of red sanders logs in the past 10 years, operating from Jaipur, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. 
 
 Recently, the Kadapa district police arrested red sanders smuggler Syed Nayeem at Bellary in Karnataka and seized 2 tonnes of logs from his godown. Similarly, the railway Kodur police arrested the smugglers of Rajampet area and seized red sanders logs from their possession. 
 
 During interrogation, the smugglers confessed that they were supplying red sanders logs to Agarwal of Jaipur city through Ali Bhai. After collecting information on him, a meeting was held with DGP M Malakondaiah who coordinated with his Rajasthan counterpart in executing the operation. 
 
 Attada said three teams were deputed about one month ago to Jaipur city to track the movements of Agarwal.
 
 The teams stayed for about one month at Jaipur to trace the location of the kingpin but in vain as the smuggler was moving from one place to another too often. Finally, on February 2, the Kadapa police received information about the location of Agarwal and arrested him in his godown.
