THANE: An on duty traffic constable was assaulted allegedly by a minor and a youth as the official had taken action against them for flouting traffic rules on Friday evening in Thane. 

 The cop, Mahesh Yadav(47), was in a towing van and put jammers on the car of the accused as it was in 'no parking' zone.
 
 "Yadav insisted that the accused,   (21) and his 16-year-old friend, parked their car without causing a traffic jam. When he returned later he saw that the car was not moved and so he put a jammer on it. The duo started abusing Yadav and kicked him. The boys were under the influence of some drug," said a police officer.
