AHMEDABAD: Call it the  . After   unleashed   on  , city police too have decided to form a permanent anti-Romeo squad to make the city   

 Gujarat was one of the first states in the country to constitute anti-Romeo squads way back in 1999. The squads, however, would come into action only temporarily in major cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot during New Year celebrations and traditional festivities like Navratri and Gauri Vrats when young girls spend time in public places during the night time.
 
 Now, a permanent anti-Romeo squad consisting of 10 police officials including male and female cops will be formed. It is likely to become operational on April 18. ACP (women cell) Panna Momaya said, "Apart from taking prompt action on complaints against eve-teasers, we will also conduct flash mock drills at places frequented by teenagers and educate girls on how to tackle lumpen elements and seek police help by dialing helpline numbers."
 
 The squad would also patrol isolated spots in the city during night hours to boost safety, added a senior police official. The city cops get an average 100 cases of eve-teasing; while majority are resolved, 25-odd get registered as police complaints.
