The judge observed that evidence exists in witnesses’ statements, and that the statements of many independent witnesses had been recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before judicial magistrates.
 
 The court observed that witnesses’ statements, evidence regarding telephonic conversations between Hardik and co-accused persons, and the opinion of Forensic Science Laboratory officials reveal that through his speeches and telephonic talks, Hardik and others hatched a conspiracy to get things done forcefully and to terrorise people. This led the administration to resort to use force, spurring law and order problems.
 
 The prosecutors nailed Hardik’s prospect of getting a discharge from the case by citing the statement of a co-accused, Ketan Patel, who turned an approver after he parted ways with Hardik. The court said that if Ketan Patel’s statement is evaluated with the evidence placed by the prosecution, Hardik prima facie appears to have committed offences punishable under sections 121A, 124A and 120B of the Indian Penal Code .
 
 Hardik’s advocate Rafik Lokhandwala said that they would appeal against the order in the Gujarat high court. Hardik was booked under sedition charges by the city crime branch in October 2015. He was also booked on similar charges in Surat. A court in Surat has also refused to discharge him in the sedition case. He has knocked at the Gujarat high court’s door.
