VISAKHAPATNAM/VIZIANAGARAM: Devotees in large numbers gathered at Trinadha Swami Temple in   in Pachipenta mandal, Vizianagaram district, on the occasion of   on Friday.

 Trinadha Swami Temple is the only temple in Vizianagaram district other than the one in Kurupam where Brahma, Vishnu and Maheswara are worshipped together as Trinadha Swamy. The temple was consecrated by the Varanasi family in the early 1800s and literally comes to life during Sivaratri when thousands of devotees from Vizianagaram and South Odisha come to seek the blessings of the Lord.
 
 “The reason why people come in such large numbers to this temple on Sivaratri is that they get a chance to worship the Trimurti and later head to the hilltop Shivalayam,” said P Surya Rao, a resident of the village. The locals conduct a huge Jatara on the occasion and the village elders make sure that the festival is observed with a great deal of zeal and celebratory spirit, he added.
 
 “This is my first time to the Jatara in 20 years as the last time I came here was way back in 1996. Things have a changed a lot. Earlier the people coming here were an eclectic mix of tribals, Odiyas and locals from surrounding villages. However, one can now see a lot of Telugu people taking part, apart from those settled in nearby Odisha,” said P Venkata Patro, a native of the village who now resides in Koraput district.
 
 The Jatara is a massive three-day festival with different troupes of bards and drama artistes from Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts. One of the organisers, P Eswara Rao said, “The local people make huge contributions to ensure that the Jatara is conducted in a proper and elaborate manner. More importantly the crowds have to be managed.”
 
 Regarding the number of people who have come for the Jatara, P Krishnaji, one of the old custodians of  , said, “The numbers have vastly exceeded our expectations. This year we have more than 30,000 people here.”
