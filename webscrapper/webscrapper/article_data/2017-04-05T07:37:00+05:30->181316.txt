LUCKNOW: In an unusual development, March 31, the closing of  , coincided with large scale   in the city. More than 50 cases of cloning have been reported with 36 complaints being brought to the notice of Hazratganj-based cyber cell on April 1, 2 and 3. In what seems to be the work of an organised cyber gang with countrywide reach, a common plot has been detected in such frauds. Cyber cell incharge VVS Sirohi said at least Rs 10 lakh has been swindled from   in three days.

 “We feel that some   managed to get their hands on confidential customer information of a particular bank branch in Hazratganj. A report will be forwarded to the data center of the bank in Mumbai for further clarity,” said Sirohi. While   of the customers remained in their possession, they got text messages about withdrawals. Miscreants used the card twice to take out Rs 40,000, in most of the cases. Sub-inspector Sudheer Kumar Gautam was also targeted by the gang on April 1. “I started following up on the case and found that many more people have been duped. Two other constables had Rs 40,000 withdrawn from their accounts,” said Gautam.
 
 On Tuesday, a police team inspected the ATM booth outside the Ashok Marg branch of the bank, the place where 60% of the victims hold savings account. Fraudulent transactions have been undertaken in Vadodara in all the cases.
 
 Sirohi said earlier too a gang which skimmed debit card data had been busted in city. “We are finding out if the same miscreants have come out on bail,” said Sirohi.
