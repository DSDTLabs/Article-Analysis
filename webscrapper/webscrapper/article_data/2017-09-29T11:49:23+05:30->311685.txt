CHANDIGARH: The Regiment of Artillery celebrated its 190th Gunners Day on Thursday at Chandimandir military station. The Gunners Day commemorates the raising of the artillery unit namely the “Bombay Battery” on 28 September 1827.

 The Regiment of Artillery has consistently done well in all roles assigned to it, be it its active operation across the entire spectrum of modern day conflict, in the international sports field or any other realm of activity. With a strong leadership, professional culture and effective training methodologies, the Regiment of Artillery continues its quest for excellence and lives up to its motto, ‘Omnipresence with Honour and Glory’.
