Mysuru: This is a classic example for how a government scheme may fail to give the desired results. In May 2017, the education department released funds to all   to provide   and socks to students between Class 1 and 10. Yet in several schools of old Mysuru region, this scheme is being implemented at the fag-end of the academic year due to shortage of funds to buy shoes and socks.

 According to sources in the department of public instruction (DPI), in Mysuru South, North and Rural blocks, 92 schools had faced fund shortage due to the difference in the amount released and the actual number of beneficiaries. "Several schools implemented the scheme at the beginning of the academic year by adjusting money from other heads. The rest are implementing the scheme now after the DPI transferred money to the school bank accounts," said a source privy to the developments.
 
 
  
  
 
 "A few schools had received excess amount while some had received less than required amount. In a few schools, school development and monitoring committees took care of the money required while in other schools, students were asked to wait. Now the DPI has directed all the concerned to send an utilisation certificate by February 15," he added.
 
 When contacted, DDPI   said all school students have provided with shoes and socks now. "If we receive any complaint from any particular school over delay in distribution, we will initiate action," she added.
