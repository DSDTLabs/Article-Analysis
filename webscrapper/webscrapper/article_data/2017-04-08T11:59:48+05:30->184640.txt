LUDHIANA: Seven armed robbers held a family of three hostage and escaped with cash and jewellery in Durga Colony, Focal Point, in the small hours of Friday. 

 Pankaj Goyal, a garment trader, was in Delhi for a business work and his wife Sunita Goyal was alone at home with her two sons, aged 14 and 10, when the robbers struck. "Our tenants live on the ground floor and we on the first. I was sleeping with my children when around 12.45am seven masked men woke us up." 
 
 The burglars placed a ladder in a neighbouring house to gain entry to the Goyal's lobby. The open door of one of the rooms made their task easy. Two of them were armed with pistols and as many with knives. "One of them pointed a gun at me and the other at my children. They asked me to give them Rs 5 lakh. When I told them that we don't have the amount, one of them said, 'Goyals have enough money'. Then the five others started searching my house. They took away Rs 1.50 lakh cash, 10-tola  , 1.5kg silver from the almirah and an LCD. Before fleeing, they removed the SIM card from my mobile." 
 
 Neighbours rushed to their house and called up the police after the family raised the alarm. Assistant commissioner of police (Sahnewal) Gurmeet Singh Kangra said the   cameras installed in the locality have captured the robbers. "The footage shows the burglars climbing down the ladder with the loot. All of them were masked and are yet to be identified." 
 
 Police suspect it to be the handiwork of a person known to the family. "The robbers knew the family lived on first floor, had kept cash and jewellery in the house and that Pankaj Goyal was out of town," a cop added. Sunita said one of the robbers addressed her as "bhabhiji" while asking for water. Sahnewal police have registered a case of  .
