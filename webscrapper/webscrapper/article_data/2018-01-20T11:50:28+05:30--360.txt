AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has directed all district judges to monitor and oversee the applications for remand sought by police officers in cases that are punishable up to 7 years imprisonment.

 The HC’s registrar general P R Patel has issued a circular to all district judges, principal sessions judge and chief metropolitan magistrate in Ahmedabad to comply with the guidelines issued by Justice   in December 2017 for all judges and police officers of the state, on how to proceed for arrest and remand of people in cases where punishment can go up to seven years in jail.
 
 The HC had said that unless in exceptional circumstances, an accused is not required to be arrested and sent on police remand. The HC had asked courts to grant remand only if police’s case appears genuine and the grounds for remand are mentioned in police’s case diary. The judges must not issue arrest warrant in such cases on basis of routine grounds for remand that accused may escape and tamper with evidence.
 
 The high court also directed judges to keep police officers in check, if they keep arresting accused in such cases by overlooking the law. The HC has asked judges to report such cops to the high court’s registrar general through district judges, if they persistently arrest people “in mechanical or malafide and dishonest manner in violation of law”.
 
 The HC’s registrar general was directed to place such cases before a judicial bench so that the director general of police (DGP) can be instructed “to take action against such errant police officer for his persistent default” or actions against the cop under the contempt of the court can also be initiated. The HC also directed all district judges to discuss the issue in monthly meetings with judges and senior police officers.
 
 The registrar general’s circular has asked all judges to comply with the HC directions.
