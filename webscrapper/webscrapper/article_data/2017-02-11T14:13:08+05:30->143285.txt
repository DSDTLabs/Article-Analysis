PANAJI: The outgoing BJP-led government has been looked at with suspicion due to a probable  , but the party feels that there is no need to dissolve the legislative assembly.

 BJP’s view is that “there is no need to dissolve Goa legislative assembly”, but it is for the Governor to decide on this issue, said South Goa MP, Narendra Sawaikar in a press conference on Friday even as debates rage over whether “assembly should be dissolved and why the government did not convene a session in December 2016 when it had ample time at its disposable.”
 
 The last session was held on August 31, 2016 while the election results are scheduled for March 11. As mandated by Article 174 of the Constitution, the Governor should summon House before the lapse of six months period between the last and the next session.
 
 Sawaikar said some rulings of the   party’s view. “And since the government has already sought a legal opinion, the issue need not be deliberated further,” he said. tnn
