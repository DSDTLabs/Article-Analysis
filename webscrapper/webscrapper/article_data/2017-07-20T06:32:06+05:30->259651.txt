CHENNAI: The state will no longer be just a  , it will also ensure   don’t fleece patients, Tamil Nadu   Systems Project joint director Dr   said on Wednesday. 

 As a first step the state has ensured that the cost of treatment for certain diseases is uniform across hospitals, he said at a conference on Affordable Healthcare for All - Way forward for TN organised by Confederation of Indian Industry. “We pay Rs 64,000 for angioplasty and stenting procedures to all hospitals. Now, as a next step we will have to see why some hospitals charge Rs 4-5 lakh for the same surgery,” he told TOI after the discussion on central and state government’s move on the capping of prices in hospitals and its impact on stakeholders.
 
 In February, the price of coronary stents a metal device used to prop open blocked arteries were capped at Rs 30,000 and it led a cost drop of about 85%. “The cost of the most expensive product has come down. So the cost too should,” he said.
 
  from the private hospitals agreed that there should be price regularisation, but they said pricing should not come in way of patients’ comfort or safety. Pointing out the state insurance does not provide for laparoscopic cancer surgeries because they are more expensive than conventional open surgeries, laparoscopic surgeon Dr Praveen Raj from GEM Hospitals said it would be retrograde. “At a time when surgeons across the globe are moving towards minimally invasive procedures, we can’t go back to open surgeries for the sake of cost. Minimally invasive procedures have the advantage of reducing the risk of infection, bleeding and spurring recovery,” he said. 
 
 Doctors said, if the state wished to play the role of a regulator, it should include views from all the state holders including manufacturers, hospital managers, doctors and patients before they arrive at standard operating cost and treatment.
