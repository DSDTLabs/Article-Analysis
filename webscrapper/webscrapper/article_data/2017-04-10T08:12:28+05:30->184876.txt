PUNE: A three-year-old succumbed to   here on Sunday, taking the number of   to 30 since the beginning of the year.

 Currently, the condition of another 23 patients is critical. They are on ventilator at various hospitals across the city.
 
 The girl, a resident of Ghodegaon in Ahmednagar district, developed influenza-like symptoms on March 26. She was running a temperature and was throwing up on March 26. By March 29, she also developed cold and cough, followed by drowsiness and breathlessness a day later. 
 
 She was initially treated by a general physician in the neighbourhood.
 
 Eventually, she was admitted to a hospital in Ahmednagar on April 3. Her condition worsened and so she was moved to   in Pune on April 5 and was put on ventilator support two days later. However, she suffered a cardiac arrest due to swine flu-induced pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and died around 10.45pm on April 7. The toddler had tested positive for swine flu.
 
 The girl’s case does not stand in isolation. The civic health department’s recent analysis of swine flu mortality this year clearly reveals that children below the age of 10 years and adults in the productive age bracket of 31-50 years are most vulnerable to swine flu. 
 
 Senior paediatrician   explained, “Children, mainly below five years of age, are not exposed to   or any other influenza virus so their natural immunity is yet to develop. Also, children in the 5-10-year age group have are in close contact with classmates, increasing their chances of being infected”
