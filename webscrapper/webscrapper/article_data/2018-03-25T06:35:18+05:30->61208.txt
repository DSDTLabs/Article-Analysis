CHANDIGARH: The   has ordered   into the faulty result prepared in selection of 1192 clerks by   (SSSB) Punjab to the prejudice of the candidates of Backward Class (BC) category.

  has passed these orders while hearing a bunch of petitions filed by candidates who had appeared in the selection process under BC category.
 
 In its orders, released on Friday, the HC has directed the CBI to conduct an inquiry/investigation into the matter “to determine the reasons for favouring the candidates lower in merit and “to find whether there is any evidence of illegal gratification being received/exchanged by the State/Board officials for extending undue favours to the candidates lower in merit which ultimately culminated in their appointment”.
 
 The premier agency has been directed to conclude its investigation into these points within a period of 10 weeks, and to place the inquiry report before the HC in a sealed cover.
 
 Earlier on December 15, 2017, the HC had directed SSSB, Punjab to recast the final merit list of candidates for recruitment to 1192 posts of Clerks, and to issue appointment letters to those candidates of BC Category, who had obtained more marks than the last selected candidate of the general category.
 
 The relief, provided in December 2017 orders, was applicable only on those who had approached the HC. In the fresh petition, the petitioners are demanding that in case their names fall within re-cast merit list, they should also be issued appointment letters as clerk. On this, the HC has handed over the matter to CBI.
 
 The allegations in the case are that board had violated the law that says if a reserved-category candidate scores more marks than the general category (GC) candidates, then the reserved-category candidates have to be selected against GC seat. However, the BC category who had scored more than the GC candidates, were rejected, whereas the GC candidates scoring lower marks were selected.
