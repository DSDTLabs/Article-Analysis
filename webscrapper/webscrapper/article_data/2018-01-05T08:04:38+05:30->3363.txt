CHANDIGARH: The Haryana   said on Thursday that it would hold three ‘manthan shivirs’ (brainstorming sessions) in the state, beginning January 15, to deliberate on increasing its outreach. With   and then the state assembly polls approaching, these camps were being held to strengthen the party.

 The three ‘shivirs’ will be of three-day duration each. “The first ‘shivir’ will be held in Gurgaon from Janaury 15 to 17 while the second will be held in Chandigarh or Panchkula from January 29-31. The last ‘shivir’ will be held in Sirsa in the first week of February,” Haryana Congress president   told reporters here. Around 1,000 leaders from the state will attend these camps, he said. 
 
 Replying to a question, Tanwar explained that the ‘shivirs’ were different from the ‘chintan shivir’, which the ruling M L Khattar government held recently. “It was a futile exercise held by a worried BJP government to find out ways and means to hold forte and keep the Opposition at bay. However, the ‘manthan shivirs’ are being held to chalk out constructive plans and policies of the party for the betterment of people,” Tanwar said.
 
 Hitting out at the Khattar government, he alleged that various sections of society were fed up with its ‘misrule’. He said the Congress had chalked out a strategy to bring back to the party fold all those leaders who had quit in the past. “The party is in touch with 20 such leaders who had either left the party as also those who are in other parties and are considering to join the Congress,” he said.
 
 Tanwar added that he intended to take out a cycle yatra in February. “Through this yatra, which we intend to start from north Haryana sometime in mid-February, we will touch each and every assembly constituency,” Tanwar said, adding that Congress president   had also been invited to hold a rally in the state.
