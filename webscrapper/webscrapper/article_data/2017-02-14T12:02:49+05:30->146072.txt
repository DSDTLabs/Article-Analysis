ITANAGAR: Union minister of state for home   said the Centre is taking serious note of the contents of the 60-page note, purportedly written by former chief minister  , before he committed suicide on August 9 last year. 

 Rijiju refused to comment specifically on the slew of allegations contained in the notes, which was leaked by a news portal recently while still in court custody.
 
 "The state of Arunachal is in a nascent stage. We must have a proper understanding of issues before we try to derive political advantage out of a tragedy. Pul's death was a tragedy; he was one of the stalwarts of Arunachal politics. His demise is a great loss for the people of the state. All allegations, however, are widespread as he has touched upon various issues," he said.
 
 The MoS said the demand by his eldest wife for a   probe into the allegations is not something the government can take a call on by itself. Chief minister  , who denied commenting on the allegations, said he would soon issue a statement after he sits for a meeting with his cabinet.
