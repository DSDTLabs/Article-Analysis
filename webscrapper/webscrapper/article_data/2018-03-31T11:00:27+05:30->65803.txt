TIRUPUR: Knitwear industrialists in the dollar city were relieved as the state government decided to exempt the state from intrastate e-way bill temporarily. 

 “It would take at least 17 different processes to manufacture a garment. Unlike many other industries, most of the processes would be done by different job work units. These units are spread across the district between 30 and 40 km. So, it would be very difficult if e-way bill would be made mandatory,” said knitwear industrialists.
 
 Post-GST, the central government announced that e-way bill was mandatory for transporting consignment worth above Rs 50,000 or more than 10km. While the central government has decided to implement the interstate e-way bill across the country on April 1, the state government passed an order recently to exempt e-way bill within the state.
 
 “It would be difficult to obtain e-way bill for every consignment through online as lakhs of traders would be engaged at a time. So, the industrialists would be in haste to complete the process, which would worsen already affected business,” said  , general secretary of South Collar Shirts and Innerwear   Association. “We have met chief minister   in February and urged him not to implement the e-way bill at all, especially intrastate,” he added.
 
 “But it is important to make the exemption permanent. We believe that the state government will make it permanent since it would benefit thousands of manufacturers,” said the industrialists.
