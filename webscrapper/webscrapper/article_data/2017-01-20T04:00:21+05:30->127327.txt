THANE: A 35-year-old   was arrested in the 32kg Mannapuram gold   case of Ulhasnagar recently. This is the fourth arrest in the case. He was given 125gm of the stolen   for transportation services he provided for the heist, police said on Thursday. 

 Seventeen persons from the Sahebgunj and Nepali watchman gangs had broke into a centre of the gold finance company and decamped with ornaments valued at around Rs 9 crore on December 26, police said, adding that only 3kg has been found till date.
 
 Khadak Singh Ahuji, 35, a   partner for Ola, was acquainted with the gang, due to his past criminal record, police said. Undercover sleuths trapped him following a tip-off that he would be going to Wagle Estate.   sources said they would remove him from the platform.
 
 “Ahuji is a history-sheeter, arrested in a few house-breaking cases in Mumbai and Thane. In fact, a few months back, he had got bail in a case and was driving a   in the city,” said a senior police officer. After coming out of the jail, he contacted an absconding accused of the Nepali gang and he was roped in for pick-ups and drops for some gang members, and for giving them safe passage out of city with the booty, added the officer.
 
 “He also guided the gang on alternative routes for carrying out the heist. The three arrested accused exposed his role,” said an officer.
 
 After dropping off the last set of accused after the heist, he was given some gold as a reward for his services, police said.
