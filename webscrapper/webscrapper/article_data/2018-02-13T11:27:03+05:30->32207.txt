Reality TV star   says she "reprogrammed" herself to think differently about food to win her battle with her weight.

 Khloe spoke about it on TV show "Revenge Body".
 
 "I love food, I'm a huge foodie. But everything in moderation for me. It is re-programming your mind. But once you get there and once you re-programme it, you start feeling good and your skin is great and your hair is growing," Khloe said.
 
 She had earlier said she has been giving into cravings and eating more while she is expecting. But she has continued to workout and "can't wait" to get her pre-pregnancy body back.
 
 "During my pregnancy, I'm obviously not beating myself up about what I'm eating at all. I'm more encouraged by how, after the baby comes, I'm going to work off every pound. I'm actually really excited to get my body back. I can't wait!
 
 "Of course, I can't go as hard as I did before, and I really do miss my intense workouts. Honestly, though, I'm just happy I still have the energy!"
