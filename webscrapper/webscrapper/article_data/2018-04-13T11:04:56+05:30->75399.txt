KOLKATA: Indian archers bagged a rich haul of seven medals in the   Stage 2 event that concluded in Manila on Wednesday. Aman Saini and Divya Dhayal claimed bronze in individual categories — men’s and women’s compound events, respectively — while the team events fetched five medals.

 
 It was a very creditable performance from a second-string Indian contingent which achieved podium finishes in all team events barring men’s compound. Saini got past his countrymate Pritish Chowdhury 143-137 in the quarters but went down 146-148 to eventual gold-medal winner Paul Marton de la Cruz of Philippines in the semifinals. Saini claimed bronze by beating Lin Che-Wei of Chinese Taipei 145-138.
 
 Divya, who won a bronze in the women’s compound team category in the Stage 1 tournament in Bangkok last month, defeated teammate   142-136 in the last-eight stage. But she failed to make the final, going down 138-147 to Chen Yi-Hsuan of Chinese Taipei. Divya then raised her game in the bronzemedal playoff match, which she won 10-9 via tie-break after being tied 138-all with Chinese Taipei rival Lin Ming-Ching.
 
 Both the men’s and women’s recurve teams clinched bronze after losing to Korea in the semifinals. The men’s team of Akash, Ho Gora and Gaurav Lambe lost 0-6 in the semifinal but subdued Mongolia by same margin to claim bronze. The women’s trio of Ridhi, Sakshi Shitole and Promila Daimary went down 4-5 in the last-four clash before outclassing Mongolia 6-2 to seal bronze.
 
 The compound and recurve mixed teams, too, claimed bronze while the women’s compound team of Mrinal Hiwrale, Dhayal and   fell 221-225 to Chinese Taipei at the final hurdle to be satisfied with silver.
