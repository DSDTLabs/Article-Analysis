NAGPUR: Nana Patole, the member of Parliament who resigned from the   and Lok Sabha in December, has now written to the central election commissioner seeking announcement of byelection for the vacant Bhandara-Gondia parliamentary seat.

 Interestingly, Patole has mentioned in the letter that his resignation from Parliament was accepted on the same day as that of Yogi Adityanath and Keshavprasad Mourya, who resigned from   and Phulpur seats in Uttar Pradesh, respectively. Patole said while bypolls for the two UP seats were held on March 11, no decision was taken on Bhandara-Gondia seat in Vidarbha..
 
 Patole has expressed surprise over this exclusion and has blamed Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. “The state has to recommend a date for conducting elections. But since Fadnavis knows for sure that there was no chance of winning that seat this time, he has preferred to keep mum,” said the former MP.
 
 Patole, an OBC leader, had left the Congress to join BJP in 2009 and first got elected to the state assembly from   district on BJP ticket. In 2014, riding the   wave he contested for the Lok Sabha and managed to defeat NCP stalwart Praful Patel.
 
 But within two years of that he was disillusioned by the Modi-style of governance and started openly expressing dissent to Fadnavis, mainly over issues related to farmers in the region. In December last, he finally quit the BJP and Parliament and returned to the Congress.
 
 Patole is not sure he would contest the same seat again for the remaining term of a year. There is also confusion since the Congress and NCP are almost certain to have a fresh political alliance and the seat may be claimed by the NCP as per the earlier seat-sharing formula. “Who contests from the seat is not relevant. Why the poll date is not being announced is my worry. I have requested the CEC to announce the date at the earliest,” said Patole.
