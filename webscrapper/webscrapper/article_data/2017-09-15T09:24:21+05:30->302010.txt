CHENNAI: The city police will soon take over the responsibility for providing security to the Madras high court from the  . In a prelude to taking on the job, and to save Rs 66 crore paid to the national para military agency annually, the government on Thursday created the post of deputy commissioner of police (Madras high court security) and appointed P Sundaravadivel to it.

 CISF has been guarding the fortified high court campus since October 2015, after chief justice   issued an order in this regard. At the time, CISF officers confirmed that they would stay in charge of security at the 155-year-old court until the state police was ready to take over. “If the government wants us to stay back, we will continue with our work, or we will shift our location to other areas, as instructed by our battalion commandants,“ an officer had said.
 
 In March this year, Acting Chief Justice R M T   said the court should be easily accessible to the general public and not appear like a military camp. It should be up to the local police to tackle a law and order problem, he said.
 
 He said the state government had been paying a huge sum of money every year to the CISF for its added responsibility. “In other parts of the country, excluding Delhi, state police personnel man the high courts,“ Justi ce Teekka Raman said. Former Madras High Court Advocates Association president   pointed out that the state government spends around `66 crore a year in expenses on salary for the CISF personnel guarding the court, their accommoda tion and other perks.
