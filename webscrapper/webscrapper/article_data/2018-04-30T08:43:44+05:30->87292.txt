JAIPUR: With rise in temperature, city hospitals have been witnessing a surge in the number of diarrhoea cases. The health department has also alerted its officials on heat stroke and other related diseases due to severe heat in the state. 

 
 
  
 
 Daily the biggest government-run child speciality hospital JK Lon is reporting 8% diarrhoea cases out of total cases reported daily in the hospital. “Over the past few days, the number of cases of diarrhoea have increased significantly. The percentage of diarrhoea cases among total patients received by hospital has increased to eight per cent,” said Dr  , superintendent, JK Lon Hospital. 
 
 The cases are reported not only from Jaipur city but also from the rural areas of neighbouring districts including   and Sikar. 
 
 The hospital’s out-patient department has increased to 2,200 patients daily due to increase in cases related to food-borne and water-borne disease. In summers, such cases increase significantly. However, hospital claimed that it is not alarming but in summers such cases always tend to increase. 
 
 Health department officials claimed that they have intensified their efforts to prevent such cases. “We are organising ‘Mera Gaon Swasthya Gaon’ from May 1. In the two-month campaign, efforts will be made to ensure that villagers, not only in Jaipur but also across the state will get clean water for drinking,” said a health department official. 
 
 Also, they will encourage people to eat fresh food and fruits to prevent such diseases. “We have issued directions to all the hospitals in Jaipur district to remain alert on food-borne diseases including diarrhoea, dysentery and vomiting. Also, we have issued an advisory to the people to follow it to remain healthy during summers,” said Dr  , chief medical health officer, Jaipur-I. 
 
 Health experts pointed out rise in temperature that helps bacterial growth in food items. People should eat fresh food to ward off risk of bacterial infection during summers.
