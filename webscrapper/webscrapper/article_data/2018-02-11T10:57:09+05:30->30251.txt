 For a down and out team, South Africa looked surprisingly buoyant at the Wanderers cricket stadium on Friday. Right now, they are desperately in need of some inspiration if they are to prevent India from running away with the series. On the eve of the fourth One-Day International against India, they are clearly depending on two factors to back them up as they gear up for a must-win game.
 
 Three down in a six-match series and with three more games to go, the hosts will be happy to find the mercurial AB de Villiers back in the team. Along with AB, they head into a special game — the pink ODI — here, reminding themselves of the significance of this occasion and the fact that they haven't ever lost a game in that attire on the previous five occasions.
 
 On one of those five occasions, de Villiers had ended up smashing a 44-ball 149 runs — against the West Indies in January 2015 — an innings that remains the icing on the cake for South Africa among all other dominating 'Pink Day' performances at home.
