MARGAO: During the extraordinary gram sabha meeting held on Sunday, the   residents voiced their firm opposition to the proposed double   while expressing their concern over the delay in constructing the railway ovebridge (ROB) or underbridge (RUB).

 Guirdolim sarpanch Sonia Fernandes told TOI, “Since the Guirdolim village panchayat had neither received the Central government notification nor the plan of the proposed double railway tracks, the gram sabha unanimously resolved to write to the   collector   requesting him to provide the panchayat with a copy of the project plan within seven days. It is nearly 30 years now that the affected local residents have been demanding either an ROB or RUB at the railway crossing.” tnn
