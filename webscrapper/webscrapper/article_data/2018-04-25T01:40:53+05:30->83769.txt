NEW DELHI: A day after a   was   at her house in south Delhi’s  ,   are   for the   who was   last month. Police have learnt that the help was employed in January this year to look after the woman’s husband while she had travelled to the US to meet her daughter. After she returned, the help was dismissed since she was absent from work regularly.

 Family members said that the victim, Usha Kumar’s movements were limited after she had suffered an injury to her hip. “The accused must have been aware of this and entered the house when no one was present in the apartment. She was alone at that particular time of the day as her husband had gone to meet someone for work,” said MM Sharma, a neighbour.
 
 “I had met her a few days back. Despite her injuries, she had climbed to the first floor to greet me. It is likely that she might have put up a fight against the attacker,” added Sharma.
 
 Probe suggests that the attackers might have been looking for something specific in the house and had ransacked the room. Kumar’s jewellery and some valuables kept in the house were found intact.
 
 After the woman’s cremation, the family members would also be asked about the role of the household help.
 
 Kumar’s brother MN Dutta said that in January, Kumar had travelled to the US alone and had employed a woman to cook food for her husband, Ajay Kumar. “She had contacted her through a vegetable vendor who used to visit the family. After she had returned in March this year, she found the help did not turn up regularly and dismissed her. She should also be questioned in this regard,” said Dutta.
 
 “It is likely that the person who had attacked Kumar did it for revenge. Her throat was found to be slit by a knife and the face bludgeoned. We are trying to find out someone who might have held a grudge against her,” said a relative.
