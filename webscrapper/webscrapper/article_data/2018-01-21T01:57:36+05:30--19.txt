GURUGRAM:   from ward 10   was caught up in a controversy when rumours that she had attempted suicide started doing the rounds on social media groups in the city on Saturday morning.

 Later in the day, Sheetal blamed her opponent Prashant Bhardwaj, who lost the civic polls to her, for the rumours and threatened legal action.
 
 It all started when messages started flashing on social media groups, saying, “Mangat Ram Bagri’s daughter-in-law has consumed poison and tried to end her life on Saturday morning.”
 
 As the news spread, Sheetal held a press conference to clarify that nothing of the sort had happened and alleged the rumours were spread by Prashant. “The whole thing was orchestrated to defame my family and specifically my father-in-law and hurt his political career. Bhardwaj had earlier also taken jibes at me and my family during the civic election campaign, however we never expected him to stoop so low,” she said.
 
 The councillor now plans to move court against Prashant for defamation and harassment. 
 
 “The rumours caused worry and tension among our friends and family members. We are consulting our lawyers and will definitely take legal action against him for spreading the rumours,” said Sheetal, who was one of the candidates in race for the mayor’s post.
 
 She also accused Prashant of framing her father-in-law in “false illegal liquor businesses” some months back.
 
 When contacted, Prashant said he never posted on social media platforms it was the councillor who had attempted the suicide. “I was talking about the suicide attempt by Mangat Ram’s nephew who was admitted to a city hospital and a case has been registered at Sector 9 police station,” said Prashant, who contested the   elections as an independent candidate.
 
 Mangat Ram, however, said no such incident had happened in his family.
