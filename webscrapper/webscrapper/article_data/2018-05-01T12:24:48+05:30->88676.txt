THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state has been taking new strides in plan implementation as part of avoiding the mad rush in March with 1,147 local bodies across the state submitting their annual plan documents (2018-19) for the approval of district planning committee by March 31. 

 Only 53 local bodies failed in submitting the plan documents in March and according to officials, plan submission of the entire 1,200 local bodies have already been completed by April 25, which is going to be a historic feat in terms of plan implementation in the state. The local bodies can now avail almost a year for execution of projects.
 
 The local self-government had introduced revised timelines for plan implementation for the period 2017-18. In 2017, 1198 local bodies had submitted plan document by May 2017 and remaining two local bodies submitted plan document by June 15, 2017.
 
 Although local bodies had submitted the plan documents by June 2017, works were stalled owing to confusion resulting from   and the actual objectives envisaged from early submission of plan document could not be met fully.   K T Jaleel said the government aims at attaining 100% in revenue collection and plan implementation in 2018-19.
 
 "Last fiscal, we could achieve nearly 90% in plan implementation despite challenges posed by GST. The revenue collection had touched an unprecedented rate of 70.07%. This fiscal we aim at cent percent in collection of revenue and plan fund expenditure. The local bodies have already been allotted 20% of plan fund," said Jaleel.
 
 The government mooted the new timelines for plan implementation as local bodies usually submitted plan documents for approval only after September.
 
 Thus, each local body could get an average of only 4-5 months for plan implementation. In 2017-18, the local bodies had got 9-10 months for plan implementation, which helped them attain nearly 90% in plan expenditure by March.
 
 The officials associated with plan implementation said the enhanced time period would result in effective implementation of projects.
 
 "Often by February, many local bodies would start diverting funds or initiate multi-year projects as there would not be enough time for completion of projects. For the first time, local bodies in   can execute projects in 11 months," said an official associated with   department.
 
 The revised timeline had already yielded positive results in 2017-18. While the state percentage of plan implementation stood at 67.07% for 2016-17, it was 85.43% in 2017-18. Gram panchayats had taken the lead in 2017-18, recording 90.63%.
