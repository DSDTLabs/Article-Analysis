JODHPUR: Deputy superintendent of police (DSP)   felt a sense of accomplishment on Wednesday after a Jodhpur court sent Asaram to life imprisonment till death. Mishra was the investigation officer (IO) who painstakingly probed the allegations, even in the face of relentless threats by Asaram’s followers.

 “I am happy that five years of our hard work resulted in his conviction,” Mishra said. A native of Jaipur, she was an assistant commissioner of police ( ) in Jodhpur in 2013, when the case first came to the Jodhpur police.
 
 It was nothing short of baptism by fire for the young officer. “It was also my first posting. I joined on July 21, 2013, and the case came to us next month in August,” she said. Currently posted as circle officer (CO) at Mandal in  , she is still hated by Asaram followers for her role in building a strong case against him.
 
 Mishra told TOI that Surat police had once alerted her to many conspiracies which were being hatched by Asaram’s supporters to eliminate her. During the initial days of investigation, intelligence agencies informed her that she was in the “hit-list” of agitated followers who were planning to buy AK-47 like lethal weapons to halt the investigation.
 
 “I was never afraid, even when the intelligence bureau (IB) warned me of some possible attacks. As an official, we are trained to handle dangerous circumstances,” she said. She was also threatened to be exploded with a bomb.
 
 “I am happy with the outcome, it shows that everybody is equal before the law,” she said. The   police also congratulated Mishra through its twitter account.
 
 “We highly compliment tenacious investigation by ACP Chanchal Mishra. She withstood severe grilling in Court by Asaram's counsel for 85 days & filed first chargesheet in 2.5 months. It is such resolute acts that bring credibility to police investigation,” the official account of the state police tweeted.
