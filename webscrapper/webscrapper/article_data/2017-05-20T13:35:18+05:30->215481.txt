'Premam' beauty   has stormed into stardom with her debut as "Malar" and has never looked back ever since.

 
 She has become a quintessential actor in the south cinema and is soon going to be seen in Sekhar Kammula's 'Fidaa' alongside Varun Tej. The girl-next-door look of Sai Pallavi has earned her some cult following and that is what had the producers and directors knocking her door. 
 
 
 After, 'Fida', the actress will be seen with actor Nani in 'MCA'. Both 'Fida' and 'MCA' are produced by Dil Raju.
 
 
 Recent news about Sai Pallavi has surfaced saying that the actress was approached to star in a bilingual project, which will produced by Lyca Productions under the direction of A L Vijay.
 
 Surprisingly,   will essay the protagonist's role in the Tamil and Telugu movie which is billed to be a horror flick. Remember AL Vijay's recent outing, a trilingual with Tamannaah, Prabhu Deva and Sonu Sood- 'Abhinetri', the movie went on to gross decent figures at the box-office and we only think that the latest one too is something on those lines.
 
 It is also said that the movie is titled 'Karu' in Tamil and is expected to go on floors from June.
 
 
 However, any other details that we can give you here need authentication and let us wait for an official announcement.
