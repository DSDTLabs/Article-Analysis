NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has asked the insurance regulator to direct all companies not to issue or renew insurance of vehicles unless they have ‘pollution under control’ ( ) certificate. 

 
 As per law, no vehicle is allowed to ply without at least having third-party insurance, a rule which is largely flouted due to poor enforcement. The ministry has also asked   ( ) to direct the companies to submit their compliance report by June 15. The ministry will also write letters to about two dozen insurance companies. 
 
 The letter issued on Tuesday said, “The Supreme Court has directed vide its order dated 10th August 2017 that the insurance companies will not insure a vehicle unless it has a valid PUC certificate on the date of the renewal of the policy. It may further be noted that fitness certificate is also a mandatory requirement for all valid registered transport vehicles.” 
 
 The ministry has also set April 2019 as the deadline for putting emission reports of all vehicles online.
