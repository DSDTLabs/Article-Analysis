Vijayawada: An officer on special duty ( ) of APSRTC, working directly under managing director (MD) M Malakondaiah, filed a complaint with Krishna Lanka police on Saturday, stating few unidentified miscreants had forged his signature and gave appointment to one Abdul Kasim, a resident of Kadapa.

 According to the special officer, Nageswara Rao, the unidentified accused persons forged his signature and submitted the appointment letter for junior assistant to Kasim (transport department) in the secretariat in Velagapudi.
 
 The shocking issue came to light when one Chand Basha, who works in the secretariat, alerted the OSD about the fake appointment letter. Nageswara Rao immediately reported it to Malakondaiah and other higher-ups. They approached Krishna Lanka police. Nageswara Rao said, “Since 2013, there were no recruitments conducted by APSRTC and I am not a competent authority in appointing any candidate. This could be the handiwork of fake job gangs,” Nageswara Rao told TOI.
 
 Krishna Lanka circle inspector Chandrasekhar said the OSD’s signature did not match with the one on the appointment letter. He said the statement of Chand Basha was recorded and a team was sent to nab Kasim. A   case was filed in this regard and cops are conducting a detailed investigation. ‘We will arrest the accused persons behind the racket,’ Chandrasekhar said.
 
 Earlier, RTC had issued a press release warning the public that miscreants were allegedly scamming people by offering fake jobs.
