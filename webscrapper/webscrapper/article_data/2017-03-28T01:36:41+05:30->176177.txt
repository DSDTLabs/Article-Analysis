NOIDA: Many residents of   woke up to dirty and foul-smelling water in their taps on Monday.

 While the   has been persisting for nearly a month, it was particularly bad on Monday because of   and a   valve in the sector malfunctioning. 
 
 Residents of F Block in Kendriya Vihar, Sector 51, said the water supplied to them on Monday morning was pale yellow and foul-smelling. “Complaints were received on the sector’s WhatsApp group from several residents,” said Sanjeev Kumar, general secretary of Sector 51 RWA.
 
 According to Kumar, the main valve of the water pump near gate No. 9 of the sector has been defective for over a week. But the problem of water leakage has persisted for a month, he said. “The problem has been recurring for a month now because whenever we reported it the authorities carry out only temporary repair. We had requested the department to fix it permanently. Despite paying the water bill regularly, we are getting polluted water in our taps,” Kumar said.
 
 Kumar said that the problem of poor quality drinking water was rampant across Noida. Residents of Sector 27 had complained last month. “The quality of water supplied in Sector 27 is so bad that it seems some sewer line is linked to the water pipeline. Repeated complaints to the junior engineer concerned have fallen on deaf ears,” said Anil Singh, who lives in Sector 27.
 
 When contacted, project engineer M D Pandey told TOI that the water leakage problem occurred in two areas in the sector. “One problem is a broken pipe which is nearly 20 years old and needs repair. Another is related to a valve which is frequently damaged by school buses which have damaged it by running on it. We hope to repair the broken pipe by Monday evening. For the second issue, we are considering shifting the line to another location so that the valve does not get damaged. This might take a couple of days,” Pandey said.
