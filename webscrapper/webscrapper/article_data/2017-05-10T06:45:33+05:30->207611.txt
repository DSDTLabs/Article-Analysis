Mumbai: Candidates who took the Sunday’s entrance exam have found that the   version of the   (National eligibility cum entrance test) was different from the English one. Parents said that they wanted a re-exam as the question papers were markedly different. 

 Parents claimed that while they were of the opinion that the exam question papers ought to be a translated version of the English paper, but 85% of the questions in the Marathi version were different. The NEET was conducted in 10 languages. 
 
 In fact, a parents’ group said the Bengali question papers too had different questions from the English question paper. 
 
 “The government has conducted a ‘one nation one exam’ without foolproof planning,” said a parent. They compared the version S of the English paper which seemed the closest to the Marathi but found that 85% of the questions were different. The Marathi version also does not match with any of the   NEET paper, said another parent. However, the CBSE which conducts the NEET, said they had not received any complaints from students. “However, if students want to, they can challenge this,” said PRO of CBSE Rama Sharma. 
 
 Over 11 lakh   and BDS aspirants on Sunday appeared for the NEET at over 1,900 centres across 103 cities.
