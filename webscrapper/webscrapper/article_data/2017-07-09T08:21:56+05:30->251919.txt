PUNE: Problems like less-than-satisfactory living conditions, overcrowding, and staff shortage at   prison were thrown into sharp relief after the murder of an inmate by another inmate on Saturday.

 “Anger management and dissatisfaction are the two biggest problems with prisoners,” said human rights advocate Asim Sarode. “Such incidents are outbursts of pent-up anger. Unfortunately there are not enough doctors or counsellors to help prisoners. The living conditions in   jail are in violation of human rights,” he added.
 
 However,  , former additional director general of prisons, said prison authorities do their best with what they have. 
 
 “Despite being understaffed, the authorities do their best to maintain discipline among the inmates. According to me Yerawada is one of the better-kept prisons,” she said. 
 
 The jail also struggles with overcrowding, said Sarode who worked in the jail for a decade. It’s capacity is 2,000 inmates but it houses 3,000 he said.
 
 “But the conditions here are much better than   jail. You cannot expect the convicts or undertrials to behave normally as they are dealing emotional trauma,” a senior police officer said.
 
 Sarode also stated that insufficient food or scarcity of water are the main reason for flashpoints. “The uniform diet is unsufficient for many prisoners, who sometimes snatch food from the weak and helpless.” he said.
 
 He further underlined the inhuman conditions in which the inmates are housed. “I have seen the prisoners develop rashes due to the poor quality soap. Their bedding stinks as there is no water to wash them. Such are the living conditions in the prison,” Sarode added.
