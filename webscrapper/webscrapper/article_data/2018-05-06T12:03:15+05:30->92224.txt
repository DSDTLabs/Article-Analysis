PANAJI: The   ( ) is keen to have 'Dempo' back in the ILeague but not with the allconquering team that has won the maximum titles in the combined history of the   and I-League.

 
 Dempo won five national titles and were the most dominant side between 2005 and 2012 when they won five league titles under coach  , who was also handed charge of the national team. Dempo parted ways with Colaco in 2013 and the Goan club has never quite hit the all-time high since then.
 
 In fact, in 2015, Dempo were relegated to the second division I-League but were back in the top tier a year later. There were celebrations all around as the 'Golden Eagles' returned to where they belong but the AIFF's proposed roadmap that made the Indian Super League (ISL) the top-tier league and relegated I-League to the second division meant Dempo, along with two other Goan clubs –   and Sporting Clube de Goa – opted to withdraw from the I-League.
 
 Having sat out for two successive seasons now, 'Dempo' could return to the I-League but only if club chairman   agrees to join hands with the AIFF and sponsor Indian Arrows, the AIFF's developmental side.
 
 According to sources, AIFF president   has held talks with Dempo and asked him to mull over the proposal.
 
 "We've not made any proposal. We had some discussions (with Dempo) last season but nothing has been discussed for the next season," said AIFF general secretary  .
 
 The AIFF general secretary said they would be "happy to have someone who can partner Arrows."
