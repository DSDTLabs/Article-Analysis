YAVATMAL: District collector Sachindra Pratap Singh has ordered an inquiry by the economic offences wing ( ) to probe into the alleged duping of people to the tune of several hundred crores by a Mumbai-based financial company.

 TOI had reported about the scam in its May 6 edition. 
 
 The collector has urged depositors and agents to file their complaints with the EOW department of the SP office so that the case can be probed by them.
 
 The collector said that the financial company received crores of rupees from farmers, farm labourers and women folks in the rural areas and promised the investors a lucrative interest rate.
 
 However, the firm shut down its offices across the state and the office-bearers were found to be absconding. The aggrieved depositors then started filing complaints in the city police station.
 
 Since the amount involved in the cheating case is pegged more than Rs 200 crore in   alone, it can be investigated by the economic offences wing of the police.
