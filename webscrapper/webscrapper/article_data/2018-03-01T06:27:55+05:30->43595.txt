MUMBAI : The   (EOW), probing the Rs 7,035 crore   (PCL)  , has initiated the process of   and other accused to recover 51 lakh  . This came as chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Wednesday that the accused would be arrested.

 Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had attached dozens of the firm’s properties, and EOW is likely to attach those bought with ill-gotten money through investment schemes.
 
 The special investigation team last month searched residential premises of five directors and seized documents. “Sebi’s priority could be to pay money to preference shareholders and then take it forward to pay loans, if any, and give debentures. EOW will directly be dealing for victimised investors who have lodged complaints,” said a source. Sebi had recently put up four properties for auction but only a plot near Pune could be sold for Rs 17.5 crore, added the source.
 
 More than 250 investors in the state have given statements to police about the investment scheme and how they were cheated. “We have booked the accused under provisions of the stringent Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors’ (MPID) Act, and will auction the attached properties as per court orders. The aim is to give justice to investors,” said an officer.
 
 The state government may make legal amendments to protect depositors and keep a check on companies duping investors with fraudulent schemes. Fadnavis said cases have been filed against the accused. “The arrests are delayed as the main accused has died,” he said. He said the state had directed that investors’ money worth Rs 7,035 crore be returned within three months. — Inputs by Priyanka Kakodkar
