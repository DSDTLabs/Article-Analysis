It has been a little over three months since Adah Sharma’s Tamil debut film with actor-filmmaker Pradbudheva ‘Charlie Chaplin 2’ went on floors, however her actress is as excited and enthusiastic about the film as she was on the first day. The prospect of sharing screen with   still thrills her; she is in awe of him and heaps praises on him when asked about the ‘Abhinetri’ star.

  Describing her character in the film as “little crazy”, Adah tells how Pradbudheva helps her to get a shot right. He often givers her suggestions and asks her to incorporate little expressions here and there. And after incorporating his inputs when she watched the take, she realises how one small expression can change the whole scene.
 
  Gushing about her co-star, Adah also said that the actor is usually quiet, but his sense of humour help diffuse difficult situations and keeps everyone laughing. He’s a lot of fun, admits Adah.
 
  Adah has earlier starred in several south films like ‘Heart Attack’, ‘S/O Satyamurthy’, ‘Rana Vikrama’, ‘Subramanyam for Sale’ and ‘Garam’.
