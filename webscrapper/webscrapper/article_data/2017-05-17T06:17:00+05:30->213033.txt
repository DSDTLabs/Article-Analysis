A student of Class III at North Point English Academy, my son,  , currently has to study two languages, English and Hindi. I made him select Hindi over   because I don’t know Bengali well and cannot teach the language to him. 

 I hail from   and studied Hindi back at school. My husband is also in a transferable job. But even otherwise, we want our Archismaan to go outside   for higher studies and at that time, Hindi will help.
 
 But having said that, I also want my son to learn Bengali. Having spent some years in Bengal, I realise that depriving him of the knowledge of the language will rob him of the opportunity to learn from the rich literature. The first thing a child learns in life is his mother tongue. So it is important that he is proficient in the language. 
 
 Bengali will also help him communicate better in Bengal and connect with people around him. Since I was not very proficient in the language, I had a lot of difficulty in communicating with locals. I don’t want my son to encounter a similar situation. 
 
 I am rather glad that the state government has taken this initiative. The move, if implemented, will help realise what I have been thinking for some time. My belief is that every child must have sufficient knowledge about his culture because it is the culture that stays with him wherever he goes. Irrespective of being a Bengali or a non-Bengali, the question of the utility of a language does not arise because it connects one to the culture. And that connection is only possible through a strong command over the language.
 
 One learns any subject properly only if it is compulsory and not a choice. Having a strong foundation in the language will also make it easier for him to deal with the language in Class IX or Class X. Things will be a little difficult initially, but with consistency, I know everything will be sorted out in time.
