 After Boney separated from his first wife and married Sridevi, Arjun and his sister Anshula have been living their lives independently sans their father. However, the sudden demise of actress   seems to have brought the family together. The recent family gathering is hinting towards the beginning of a new bond between the father and son duo.
 
 Arjun had recently returned back to Mumbai from Punjab where he was shooting for his upcoming film 'Namastey England' which also stars   and hosted a dinner for his father and step-sisters.
 
 Meanwhile, on the other hand, Janhvi too has resumed the shoot of her upcoming debut film 'Dhadak'. Helmed by Shashank Khaitan, 'Dhadak' also stars   in lead role.
