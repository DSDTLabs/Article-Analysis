NAVI MUMBAI: A 31-year-old man, working as a sweeper at a school in Kharghar, was arrested on Sunday for allegedly sodomizing an 8-year-old boy inside the school. 

 The boy, a class II student, narrated his ordeal to his mother on Sunday, two days after the incident, when she observed that he was getting scared to go to school. The boy told his mother the sweeper had fondled his private part. His father said he had seen blood on the private part. But, medical reports do not mention injury. The police said the accused had forced the boy into oral sex. 
 
 Senior inspector Dilip Kale of Kharghar police station said, “The boy said the incident occurred on Friday between 1pm to 3pm. The sweeper approached him near the toilet on the third floor and took him to an empty class on the ground floor where he unzipped the boy’s pants and fondled him.”

  The police has started scanning CCTV footages from all 14 cameras in the school building but the footage did not show the accused with the boy.
 
 While the boy’s mother works as a househelp, his father is a chauffeur with a private company.
