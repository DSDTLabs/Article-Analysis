ROHTAK: Days after the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) gave its support to the ongoing Jat agitation for reservation, former Haryana chief minister   of the Congress on Thursday also announced his party’s support to the demands of the community, including reservation in jobs and educational institutes under the other backward classes (OBC) category.

 Congress MLA from Badoda in Sonipat Sri Krishan Hooda on Thursday reached Jassia village in Rohtak, where a dharna had been organised under the banner of the All India Jat Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti led by its convener  . Addressing the gathering, MLA Hooda said, “The Congress will raise the Jats’ demand in the   and will stand by the community till their demands are accepted.”
 
 Attacking the BJP governments at the Centre and in Haryana, the MLA said the Jat community on dharna had seven key demands and they all were acceptable. Hooda told TOI on phone that the Jats on dharna had his support as long as their agitation remained peaceful. He said in a democratic set up everyone had the legitimate right to raise their demands within the constitutional limits.
 
 Unlike Wednesday during the presence of AIJASS convener Malik, the turnout at the Jassia dharna was not massive but moderate. Notably, the AIJASS had asked political parties, including ruling BJP, to support its demands. 
 
 Meanwhile, on the fifth day police and paramilitary personnel continued to keep a vigil on the dharna venue by camping at a safe distance.
