 The incident came to light when Devkishan Katadiya did not reach his home at Kamrej near Surat on Saturday. On Friday, Katadiya’s parents had asked him to come home after his viva results, in which he had failed, were declared. On Saturday noon, his father Devshi called him but he did not answer the phone. He called several times in the afternoon but when the call went unanswered, Devshi asked the hostel’s warden to check for his son in his room.
 
 The warden found Katadiya’s phone, wallet, identity cards and a two-page letter addressed to his family members. In the letter, Katadiya stated that his exams went well yet he failed. He alleged that some teachers had been unjust and had deliberately given him poor marks despite his good performance in the viva. He also wrote that because of his step, his family will be very sad yet he is going away as injustice has been done to him.
 
 His family members reached city on Saturday night and informed Gorwa police about it. The police on Sunday took statements of his friend. “Through the statements of his friends, it looks like he was under depression due to which he went away. Yet we are making efforts to find him,” said S M Bharwad, Gorwa police sub-inspector.
 
 Katadiya’s brother Hitesh said that his brother had never failed during all these five years. “He had cleared the university exam but had failed in viva. So what he has written may be true,” said Hitesh, who is preparing for GPSC exams.
