MUMBAI: A technical glitch disrupted the local train services on Mumbai's Harbour line between Wadala and Sewri stations early on Thursday.

  
  
 
 The problem occured at around 6.30am due to a fault in the over head electrification (OHE) system,   tweeted. 
 
 The Central Railway said that BEST is running additional buses to clear the morning rush. Harbour services between CSMT and Vadala Road will soon be restored, it said.
