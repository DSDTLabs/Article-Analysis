MUMBAI:   president Sharad Pawar on Saturday warned CM Devendra   that his government would be held responsible if NCP leader   suffers any untoward fate in the days to come. In a strongly worded letter to Fadnavis, Pawar expressed concern over the deteriorating health of Bhujbal who has been languishing behind bars since March 14, 2016 and his health is in a fragile condition.

 Fadnavis reacted to Pawar’s communication, saying the jail authorities are concerned about his health. “Bhujbal is in magisterial custody, the government has alimited role, the administration is trying to provide him proper health care,’’ Fadnavis said in response to TOI’s message.
 
 Pawar said, “As of now, legal matters concerning Bhujbal have not been decided by the court and unless and until judiciary comes to a conclusion, he is deemed to be innocent. The apex court has time and again held that bail is the rule and jail an exception. The same principle is applicable to Bhujbal. It is unfortunate that bail has been denied to him time and again, however, I do not want to comment on it.”
 
 Stating that Bhujbal is a respected mass based and OBC leader, Pawar said he does not expect anything but proper treatment for him, which is his constitutional right. “Knowing well Bhujbal’s overall health condition and advancing age, I am sure you will direct that prompt steps be taken to ensure that proper medical treatment is administered to him. I am saddened to record that if Bhujbal suffers any untoward fate, your government will be responsible,’’ Pawar said.
 
 Bhujbal was arrested under   allegedly after the state exchequer suffered a loss of Rs 870 crore in Maharashtra Sadan scam. His nephew, Sameer, was also arrested.
 
 A senior official said last week Bhujbal was admitted to JJ Hospital due to abdominal pain.
