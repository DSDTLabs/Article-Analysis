HYDERABAD: :   Cement in unlikely to engage in negotiations with other companies to seek a better deal than the Rs 7,266 crore offered by UltraTech Cement even as the insolvency tribunal hearing the matter suggested that lenders could consider an out-of-court deal. 

 UltraTech has offered a comfort letter to   that controls 98% of Binani Cement, helping it raise funds and settle the dues and withdraw the case from insolvency proceedings. The offer came after Dalmia Bharat emerged as the most-preferred bidder.
 
 On Tuesday, the Kolkata bench of NCLT contended that in the larger interest of the creditors, the Committee of Creditors (CoC) could give it a consideration, an agency report said. This came despite suggestions that the case could be withdrawn only after approval had been received from a higher court. The lawyer for the CoC argued against an out-of-court settlement.
 
 Binani Cement and UltraTech have, however, maintained that Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) lists value maximization as the key objective. Armed with the court order, Binani Industries now intends to begin negotiations with lenders, the company's advisor Sameer Kaji told TOI. 
 
 Asked if the company would accept a higher bid, Kaji said, "The company is committed to what it has said. It will only benefit the equity holders. The interest of all creditors, secured, unsecured and trade creditors, have been taken care of." 
 
 The Binani advisor further said that the interests of unsecured lenders such as   and SBI Hong Kong were also protected by the latest offer by UltraTech in what has been a high-pitched battle for the cement company as rivals look to ramp up presence in North India. Binani and UltraTech have accused the resolution professional for the insolvency proceedings of initiating steps that lacked transparency.
