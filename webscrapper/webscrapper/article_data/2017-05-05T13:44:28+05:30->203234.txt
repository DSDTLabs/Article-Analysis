PUNE: A   (NAS) will be done every year for standards I, III and VIII. The test will be conducted in 680   in which 34,000 government and government-aided schools will be sampled. The exam will be held simultaneously across the   and assessed simultaneously.

 Y Sreekanth, head of the educational survey division in NCERT, said, “Till now, the NAS was a three-year cycle. This year onwards, it will be a   process, held and assessed simultaneously across the country.” 
 
 Sreekanth addressed the   for education officials where he said the tests will be based on the learning outcomes defined for each class and if there is a deficiency, solutions will be given.
 
 The assessment will probably be done in September-October period while the feedback assessment will be done by December. Based on how students perform on the test on learning outcomes, they will be taught to improve in the last quarter between January and March.
 
 As per the NAS action plan, the test will be developed by NCERT and then translated into regional languages. 
 
 In February, Dheeraj Kumar, the outgoing commissioner of education, had spoken about how Niti Aayog along with HRD ministry had come up with an idea to rank states based on quality of education provided at the primary level. “The states will be marked out of 1,000 marks. Of this, 600 marks will be determined by the NAS and the remaining will depend on the administrative reforms in the education sector by a particular state,” Kumar said.
 
 A principal and educationist said students are subjected to too many tests and a blanket assessment and then a blanket improvement model will never work. “The Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation is the best way to analyse individual students and help them improve. By testing students, we are again bringing back the notion that only exams can test the intelligence of students. What we require is a better implementation of CCE and well-equipped teachers,” the principal said.
