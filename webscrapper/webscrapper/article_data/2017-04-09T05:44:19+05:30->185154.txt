BALLARI: Police arrested five persons of a family on Saturday, for the murder of their daughter  , 22, and her friend,  , 20. The murders are suspected to be honour killings, which shook Hagaribommanhalli taluk of Ballari district.

The family objected to Reshma falling in love with Nagraj, and beat them to death with iron rods on March 27. While Reshma died protecting Nagraj from the brutal assault, he died three days later on March 31, at the doors of Manipal Hospital. His family members requested an autopsy to find out the cause of death.
 
 The autopsy report said Nagraj died due to injuries. His parents, suspecting that their son was murdered, requested police to investigate. Charges were filed under Sections 302, 202 IPC, and as an SC/ST atrocity case.
