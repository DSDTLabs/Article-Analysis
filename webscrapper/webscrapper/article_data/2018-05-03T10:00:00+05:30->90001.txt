Director Dhrubo Banerjee’s latest release, Guptodhoner Sondhane, had a special screening at a city multiplex on Sunday. A bevy of stars attended the event, which also saw the presence of the cast and crew of the film. 
 
  
 However, the lead actor of the film,  , who plays  , a dashing and suave Oxford-return history professor and unearths a hidden treasure of Mughal prince   from his ancestral mansion, gave the event a miss. 
  
  
 The director, who was seen ushering in the guests, said, “The film has a lot of   and nostalgia attached to it. The shooting of the film was a memorable experience for all of us. Also, I am hoping that the character of Sonada will strike a chord with the audience. Even though he’s not a goyenda, his virtues and qualities 
 are similar to that of Bengalis’ favourite Feluda.”
