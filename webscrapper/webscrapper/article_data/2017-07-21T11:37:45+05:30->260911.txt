LUCKNOW: As expected, the election of NDA's presidential nominee   saw   by MLAs in Uttar Pradesh as well. While the total strength of NDA MLAs in UP is 325, Kovind received 335 votes. This means that even if all four independent MLAs voted for the BJP-backed candidate, there were still six legislators from SP and other   parties who voted for Kovind.

 Independent MLAs Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya and Amanmani Tripathi had openly expressed their support for Kovind's candidature when the voting took place. On Thursday, when the result of voting for Presidential election came out, cross- voting by other party candidates became amply clear.
 
 The Samajwadi Party was already a divided house with SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and his borther Shivpal openly supporting Kovindâ€™s candidature, while SP chief Akhilesh Yadav asking his MLAs to vote for UPA nominee Meira Kumar. The extra votes received by Kovind clearly suggested that the BJP backed candidate got the votes of SP MLAs other than Shivpal.
 
 Speculations of BSP MLAs voting in favour of Kovind too has been rife amid reports of a couple of of them being in touch with the BJP leaders. BSP's legisltaive party leader, Lalji Verma, had, however, put the speculations to rest saying that there was no differences of opinion within the party.
 
 Political experts said that the cross-voting by members of SP and/or BSP was indicative of BJP managing to make inroads into rival camps. This was despite claims by Congress, SP and BSPthat the Presidential election was not just a contest between two individuals but also two ideologies.
