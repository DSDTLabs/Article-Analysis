NASHIK: It seems that the   medium students of Middle School   examination who lost their opportunity to get scholarships due to administrative goof up last Sunday have to wait longer to get justice. 

 The students were served the question papers of mathematics in   medium. As most of them failed to understand many narrative questions, they came out without solving the question paper. 
 
 While the education department held the school principal of the examination centre responsible for the goof up, the school authorities, on Tuesday countered education officer’s action and claimed that the blunder has happened due to administrative failure. 
 
 The Maratha   (MVP) authorities submitted an official correspondence to Education commissioner Dheeraj Kumar and requested him to intervene. MVP General Secretary Dr Nilima pawar made it clear that the Principal of schools should not be held responsible for the goof up at the time of Scholarship examination. 
 
 “The entire process of scholarship examination is being conducted by the education department and   of Examinations, Pune. The forms were filled and the I-cards were distributed online. It is not proper to hold the principal of the school or the examination centre responsible for the goof-up,” he said. tnn
