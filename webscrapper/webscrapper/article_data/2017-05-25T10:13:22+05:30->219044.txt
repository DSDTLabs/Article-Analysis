Today, she’s the popular Suhana from Kuch Rang Pyaar Ke Aise Bhi, but the journey to fame wasn’t easy for five-year-old  , who plays   and Erica Fernandes’s daughter on screen.
 
  Her real father, fruit vendor Shafi Shah, was struggling to make ends meet before Aaliya hit pay dirt with the   show.
  
  “I’m not connected with the entertainment industry in any way. For a couple of years, I also worked as a part-time autorickshaw driver in the evenings in Surat where we lived, to earn a little extra money to support the family. When Aaliya was three, she would enact TV show characters and follow everything on it.
  
  
 
  
  Seeing this, I thought of taking her to the acting field. With some help from my friends, after two years of auditions and struggle, Aaliya got Suhana’s role in Kuch Rang Pyaar Ke Aise Bhi. It gives me immense happiness to see my daughter act on national television. We are better off now,” Shafi Shah told Mirror recently, while Aaliya is loving every bit of the limelight. “I am always excited to act. My co-star Golu (Pragyaj Jain) has become my best friend and together we have a lot of fun on the set,” Aaliya beamed.
