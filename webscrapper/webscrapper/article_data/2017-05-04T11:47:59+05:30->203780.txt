HYDERABAD: Making it clear that all the lease holders who refuse to vacate the premises after the expiry of lease period come under the definition of  ,   of the   said that Greater   is well within its rights to evict such traders who have been running several shops in the beach road area of  . 

 The judge said this while dismissing scores of petitions from several such traders who were urging the court to stop their evictions.
 
 The Judge in his order said that all the traders had set up their shops along side the beach road in 1991 after securing the premises from GVMC through a lease. The last renewal for their leases was done in 2008 and even that lease term had ended in 2011. 
 
 When they refused to hand over the premises, the GVMC, which is seeking the area for its beach beautification project, has slapped on them the eviction notices under Public Premises (eviction of the unauthorised occupants) Act, which is a Central Act.
 
 The traders were claiming that the GVMC cannot be an authority under this central Act and hence its application on them is unlawful. The district judge had earlier dismissed these contentions and directed the traders to hand over the premises to the GVMC. The district judge orders were challenged by the traders in the high court. 
 
 Justice Kodanda Ram said that there is AP Public Premises Act which is a state Act and all its provisions are identical to the Central Act and just because the GVMC estate officer wrongly quoted the word central Act in the place of the state Act, this does not invalidate the ongoing eviction process.
 
 After the judge dismissed their plea, they requested the court to grant them three months time to vacate the leasehold premises. The judge granted them one month time.
