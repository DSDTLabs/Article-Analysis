CHENNAI:   and Japanese coast guard are to hone skills in Bay of Bengal next week to fight   in Straits of Malacca in   and Philippines sea. Indian and Japanese coast guard ships already patrol these areas because the sea route between India and Japan and South Korea pass through these pirate infested area. 

 With trade increasing, anti-piracy operations are becoming important. Joint exercise will help better coordination. An Indian Navy ship had just returned from South Korea and Malaysia. Japan Coast Guard (JCG) ship Tsugaru reached   on Friday. After the welcome ceremony organised by Indian Coast Guard Japan Coast Guard ship Tsugaru’s commanding officer   said, “We are here for anti-piracy cooperation. 
 
 This is the fifth time a Japan Coast Guard ship has come to Chennai.” Indian Coast Guard ship Shaurya was in South Korea and has returned to Chennai a few days ago. The forces are also in close association with Malaysia and Singapore as well to bring in a combined effort to tackle pirates.
 
 A senior official of Indian Coast Guard said that pirate activity had gone down considerably. “But we need to work together on these sensitive shipping lines to ensure that trade can be carried out without the risk and delays associated with piracy,” he added.
