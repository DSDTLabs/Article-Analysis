Actress   says she no longer leads her party girl lifestyle. In fact, she would rather not even use that word.

 According to reports, Lohan says all the rumours are what led to her opening up a nightclub in Greece.
 
 "I get so uncomfortable with that word 'party'. People are still stuck in the past, of the stories I had in Los Angeles and I hate it. It was all lies," told Lohan.
 
 "I thought, ‘What's the one thing that people have most misconstrued about me? It was probably about me always going to clubs, so I was just like, ‘Well, I'll make my own'. And now I never go to clubs," she added.
 
 The 31-year-old actress has lived in Dubai over the past few years and currently enjoys the privacy that it provides.
 
 "I moved here for that purpose - I don't have to be publicly seen all the time or discuss what I'm doing. I get more work done because I don't have the scrutiny and fixation on what I'm doing every second. I work all the time; my mind never stops," said Lohan.
