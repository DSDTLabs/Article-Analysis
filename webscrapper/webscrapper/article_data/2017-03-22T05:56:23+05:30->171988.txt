CHANDIGARH: The inaugural session of the seventh Chandigarh Social Science Congress (  VII) on the theme of ‘Achieving sustainable development goals: Opportunities, challenges and strategies’ was held here at Law Auditorium, Panjab University (PU), on Tuesday. The keynote address was presented by the chief guest H K Dua, eminent journalist, parliamentarian and   awardee, who is an alumnus of  . 

 The theme of the congress was introduced by dean, faculty of arts, chief coordinator Chasscong VII, Prof B S Ghuman who underlined the significance of the global agenda of sustainability highlighted in the UN preamble regarding people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership. He suggested five ways through which academics can join the pursuit of sustainable development. 
 
 Dua in his key note address chalked out certain areas of concern, one of which was the impact of social media on social development. “Research says that a large chunk of the students’ time is being wasted in reading, responding and managing the social media where all wisdom is reduced to 144 letters, shallowness of prosaic messages and negative activities like trolling to destroy one’s so-called enemy are influencing the people in unforeseen ways. The coming up of a concept like post-truth, which is not a lie but also not a truth and has been coloured in specific ways to reach a certain agenda, has also changed how perceptions are shaped in the society,” said Dua. 
 
 According to Dua, statistics are being used to reduce people into numbers, dots and digits. He recalled the novel by the writer   titled ‘Hajar Churashir Maa’ where a bright student is reduced to corpse numbered 1,084. 
 
 Dua has contributed Rs 40 lakh towards the setting up of  , which will carry out outreach activities and work to promote media literacy among the masses.
