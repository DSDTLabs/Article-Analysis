NEW DELHI: Pakistan fast bowler   has picked Indian captain   over Joe Root, Steven Smith and Kane Williamson as the best batsman in the world. Amir, who conducted a chat session on Twitter, was asked who he thought was the best in the business among the four, and his reply was: "They all are but personally Virat kohli"

  
  
 Amir reiterated his statement by replying to another tweet that asked of him: "who is currently the best batsman in the world according to u". Amir's reply was once again Kohli.
 
  
  
 In the Champions Trophy final, Amir ripped the heart out of the Indian batting order with his devastating opening spell in which he removed India's top three - Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma - as Pakistan went on to beat India by 180 runs to win the ICC title for the first time. 
 
 Amir revealed that he equally cherished picking up  's wicket in his first ever Champions Trophy in 2009. The left-arm quick removed the leading run-scorer in ODIs for 8 as India fell 54 runs short of Pakistan's total of 302 during the league stage at Centurion. 
 
  
  
 Amir also revealed that the spell he bowled against India in the 2016 Asia Cup remains his favourite. Defending 83, Amir sent India in early trouble removing Rohit, Dhawan and Suresh Raina and restricting them to 8/3. It took a counter-attacking knock from Kohli to ensure an Indian win.
 
 The two have shared mutual respect and admiration for one another in the past and continue to do so. Kohli had earlier praised Amir for sporting a wonderful comeback to cricket after his troubled past of match fixing. Kohli even gifted Amir a bat out of affection during the eve of the India-Pakistan match at the Eden Gardens during the World T20 last year.
