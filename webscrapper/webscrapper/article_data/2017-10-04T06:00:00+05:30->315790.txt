Held at their resort tucked away in Moinabad, the classy bash turned out to be one helluva party, where Hyderabad’s good ol’ p3 crowd gathered to bond over some great food and good music. From   and   to Brij-Bhupen Sahanis to Zia Ansari, Savita Menon and more, the do saw old party buddies reconnecting and chilling out.
