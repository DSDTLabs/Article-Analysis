NEW DELHI: Just a few months after he scored an excellent 175 off 141 balls in an ODI against Australia, Tendulkar broke a barrier that had not been breached in over 40 years on this day in 2010. On a flat track in Gwalior, he stunned the South Africans to become ODI cricket's first male double-centurion. Tendulkar overcame cramps, heat and humidity to script an amazing innings which contained 100 runs in fours alone. He finished on exactly 200 not out, taking his tally of ODI centuries to 46 while eclipsing Saeed Anwar's 194 against India and Charles Coventry's 194 not out versus Bangladesh. 

 Belinda Clarke of Australia was the first player to score a double century in ODIs when she smacked an unbeaten 229 against Denmark Women in the 1997/98 World Cup match played at the Middle Income Group Ground, Bandra, Mumbai on December 16, 1997. 
 
 His first century took 90 balls, his second half-century just 28 balls, and he reached 200 with a steer past backward point. His awesome effort took India to a match-winning 401 for 3. The capacity crowd at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium witnessed history on Wednesday as Tendulkar, statistically the greatest batsman the game has ever seen, pushed a Charl Langeveldt delivery through the off-side and ran a single to achieve a feat which no other cricketer has achieved.
 
  
  
 
 One-day international cricket, since its 1971 inception, had to wait nearly four decades to see a batsman score 200. The previous best mark was shared by Zimbabwean Charles Coventry (194 not out against Bangladesh in 2009) and Pakistan's Saeed Anwar (194 against India in 1997).
 
 As the crowd erupted with unbridled joy, Tendulkar, tired but composed, took off his helmet, looked skyward, closed his eyes to offer a silent prayer.
 
 His captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni came down from the striker's end to shake hands and hug him.
 
 And as Tendulkar set on his way back to the pavilion after the completion of the Indian innings, a tumultuous celebration greeted him.
