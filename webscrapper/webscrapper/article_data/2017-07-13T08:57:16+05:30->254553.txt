Celebrating a green Ganesh Utsav will not be a costly affair anymore thanks to the Goods and   ( ).

 Purchasing a Ganesh idol made with local soil and natural colours will be affordable from this year than the fancy idols made with Plaster of Paris (PoP). There is 12% GST on PoP and 28% GST on paints and varnishes (including enamels and lacquers) based on synthetic polymers or chemically modified natural polymers, making it costlier than eco-friendly idols. 
 
 As per experts and idol-makers in the city, the GST effect may not be visible this year, but from next year, celebrating an eco-friendly festival will be a better deal. “Most of the idol makers are in the final phase of their annual idol making exercise as Ganesh Utsav will start on August 25. Big idols are almost ready for colouring. So, the price effect may be negligible this year. But, GST has encouraged the use of eco-friendly idols,” said leading sculptor in the city, Mayur More. 
 
 Earlier, there was 10% VAT and Import Duty on PoP while 18% tax on chemical colours. The GST has increased tax on both these goods. 
 
 On the other hand, it has made locally produced clay idols, earthen pot and clay lamps free of taxes.
