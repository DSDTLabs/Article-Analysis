CHENNAI:   chief minister O Paneerselvam on Tuesday night received support from unexpected quarters -- opposition party leader and   working president M K   – after the former declared that he had forced to resign. 

 Stalin said "strict action" should be taken against the people who had forced a sitting chief minister to resign. Stalin said DMK would function not as an enemy but as an opposition party and support a functional government in this time of crisis. 
 
 He urged the acting Governor C Vidyasagar Rao to establish a "functional government" in Tamil Nadu immediately. 
 
 Stalin said, "The Governor must do this either by convening the assembly or by finding out which party has the support of MLA majority.” 
 
 Stalin has been showing cordiality towards Paneerselvam ever since the latter assumed office after the demise of AIADMK leader and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. 
 
 The opposition leader stood by him when the assembly met to pass the ordinance allowing jallikattu and later attended Republic Day celebration where Paneerselvam hoisted the national flag and received the salute.
