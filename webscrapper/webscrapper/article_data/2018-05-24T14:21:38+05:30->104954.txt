 A total of 394 students had secured above 491marks last year but not a single student could do it this year. Abolition of the ranking system was attributed to the fall in the number of high performers. “It is indeed a positive shift where students are not going for high scores but focusing on the basics of the subjects.
 
  Moreover, they are realising that it is their understanding of the subject that would help them crack competitive exams not their score in the board exams,” said chief educational officer M  .
