PATNA:   CM   on Wednesday said his Shiromani Akali Dal and ally BJP would win majority of the seats in the Punjab assembly polls slated to commence from February 4.

 “We are certain of getting three-fourth seats in the upcoming Assembly elections as there is no opposition in Punjab,” Badal told reporters soon after arriving at Patna for participating in the ongoing Parkashotsava celebrations on Wednesday.
 
 Badal arrived here on a chartered flight along with his son and deputy chief minister of Punjab Sukhbir Singh Badal and daughter-in-law and Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. Bihar chief minister   was at Patna airport to receive the Badal family. Nitish and Badal have been close to each other for over three decades.
 
 Badal praised Nitish for making elaborate arrangements for ongoing   celebrations. “Khalsa Panth would always praise Nitish for organising such grand celebrations,” said Badal.
 
 Badal stayed at hotel in the city with his family members and attended dinner at Nitish’s official residence 1, Anne Marg, in the evening. He is slated to be at   on Thursday for the main Prakashotsava celebrations, which is to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well.
 
 Badal’s predecessor Captain   too offered prayers at Takhat Sri Harmandir Sahib Gurdwara on Tuesday, followed by RJD chief Lalu Prasad. Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi too visited the gurdwara on Wednesday. Delhi CM Kejriwal had also offered prayers at the holy shrine on Monday.
