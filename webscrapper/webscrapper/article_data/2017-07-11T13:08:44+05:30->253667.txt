 has finally confirmed that his next film will be in the direction of Koratala Siva. The duo was actually supposed to do a project earlier and producer Bandla Ganesh had come forward to bankroll it. But a month after the launch of the film, it was shelved. Explaining the reason for this,   said in an interview that he was not fully satisfied with the script and did not want to rush through with the film. He had therefore requested Charan and the producer that they call off the film and start another one only when he was absolutely certain about the script. 

  It seems like Koratala has now come out with the perfect script for Charan. The film will go on floors in the summer of 2018 with the sole exception being that Ram Charan himself is going to produce the film, along with Niranjan Reddy of 'Matinee Entertainments', which is touted to be an action-entertainer. Charan is currently doing ‘Rangasthalam’ in the direction of Sukumar whereas Siva is directing   in ‘Bharat Ane Nenu’.
