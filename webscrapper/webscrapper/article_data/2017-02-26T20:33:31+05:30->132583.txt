The Iranian star of Oscar-nominated film 'The Salesman' said today she would boycott the awards in protest at President Donald  's 'racist' ban on Muslim immigrants. 

  
  
 "Trump's visa ban for Iranians is racist. Whether this will include a cultural event or not, I won't attend the #AcademyAwards 2017 in protest," tweeted Taraneh Alidoosti, the film's 33-year-old lead  . 
 
 
  Trump is reportedly poised to stop visas for travelers from seven Muslim countries, including Iran, for 30 days. 
 
 He told on a news channel yesterday that his plan was not a 'Muslim ban', but targeted countries that 'have tremendous terror.' 'The Salesman', directed by acclaimed Iranian filmmaker   is nominated for best foreign language film at the Academy Awards, which take   next month. 
 
 Farhadi won an Oscar in 2012 for his film 'A Separation'.
