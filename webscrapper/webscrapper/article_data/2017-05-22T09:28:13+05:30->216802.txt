PUNE: A sessions court has rejected the   application of one of the four accused involved in the murder of a watchman at a construction site in   in April 2015.

 Ramesh alias   was among the four accused arrested by Wanowrie police for bludgeoning the victim, Akbar, with cement blocks on April 26, 2015. Salim Mujumdar, the other watchman at the site, had lodged an FIR.
 
 The court had rejected Ammya’s first bail plea on October 9, 2015 after the police had filed a chargesheet on July 23, 2015. He has been in jail since his arrest.
 
 Additional sessions judge M R Purwar, while rejecting his plea, “The chargesheet makes it clear that the offence in question was committed in a pre-planned manner. The FIR and supplementary statement by the complainant is self sufficient to demonstrate involvement of present applicant. Fifteen days prior to the assault, the modesty of daughter of deceased was outraged and deceased had slapped Ekkya and at that time, Ekkya gave threats. It therefore, prima facie reveals that in order to take revenge, the present offence has been committed in a pre-planned manner. Specific overt act and role of present applicant is there in the statement of the witness. The applicant’s disclosure statement led to recovery of blood stained clothes. Therefore, there is strong prima facie caase against the present applicant.”
