NAGPUR: Followers of Gandhian Thought on Friday decided to promote Mahatma Gandhi’s ideology among youths on a massive scale ostensibly with a view to ensure that peace existed between different religions in the country and they worked unitedly for a common goal. 

 The proposal came during ‘Ba-Bapu 150 jayanti varsha samyojan sabha’, a meeting of Gandhians, organized by Nagpur Zilla Sarvoday Mandal (NZSM) at Sarvoday Ashram, to mark the 150th birth anniversary of the Mahatma and Kasturba Gandhi. 
 
 Secretary of NZSM   said, “Regular programmes must be organized across the city, highlighting Gandhi’s life and works so that more youths can participate in the events.”
 
 Lawyer Mama   said, “Before promoting Gandhian ideology among citizens, we must ensure that his followers properly understand his views. We must interpret the way the Mahatma would have acted in today’s time.”
 
 “Gandhi’s views on secularism, tolerance, brotherhood and dharma, besides others, must be followed to bring about a change in the attitude of people. We should work to bring together people from various religions rather than dividing them. Implementation of ‘lokneeti’ is essential than ‘rajneeti’ to create a healthy society,” Gadkari added.
 
 Dr   said, “Booklets on the life and thoughts of Gandhi should be distributed to the people so that they could understand his ideology.”
 
  said, “It is necessary to acquaint people with Gandhi’s views for which ‘bhajans’ written by the Mahatma should be sung at different squares every week.”
 
 Social activist Madhukar Khopde said, “Portraits of Gandhi should be put up at every school and government office. If this is not done, then we should stage protests and force the authorities to do it.”
 
 Gandhian thinker Leela Chitale and social worker Umesh Choube were present at the meeting.
