VADODARA: The   high court has temporarily stayed order of sessions court and the trial against land agent Arvind Jani in a case of Negotiable Instruments Act. The sessions court had ordered Jani to deposit Rs 25,000 with district legal service authority for filing a revision application in the case which was filed by   ( ).

 Jani’s lawyer   argued before the high court that the trial in the lower court was according to regular trial procedure even when his lawyer had objected to the procedure during the trial. The high court has stayed the trial as well as the order of the sessions court until the final disposal of the case.
 
 BCA had filed a case against Jani as a post-dated cheque of Rs 8.22 crore issued by him had bounced. BCA had invested Rs 4.5 crore in 2007 in a piece of land in   in a deal which was done through Jani. However, since the deal fell-off the cricketing body was trying to recover the money along with interest.
 
 Jani had filed a revision application in sessions court saying that the BCA’s case against him that is being heard by the trial court is not according to the procedures of law. Before filing the application in district court, Jani had applied in the lower court too but his application was rejected.
 
 The sessions court had rejected Jani’s application on the grounds that he was aware about the validity of the law yet he filed the revision application which has delayed the trial since June 2015. The court had therefore ordered Jani to deposit Rs 25,000 with district legal service authority.
