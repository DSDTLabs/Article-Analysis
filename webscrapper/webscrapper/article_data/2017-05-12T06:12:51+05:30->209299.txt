IMPHAL: Taking serious note of the alleged threats a   appearing on behalf of the family of a   has been subjected to,   has initiated a   

 The case could be referred to the National Investigating Agency (NIA), if necessary, said principal secretary (home) J Suresh Babu, considering the alleged involvement of militant outfits.
 
 The lawyer, Utsav Singh Bains, is providing legal assistance to the family of Irom Roger, a student who was shot dead in a case of road rage in March 2011. The case shot into the limelight because of the involvement of Ajay Meetei, chief minister N Biren Singh's son. Ajay is now in jail after a local court sentenced him to five years' imprisonment in January this year.
 
 Bains reportedly wrote a letter to the Union home ministry, saying that the victim (Irom Roger)'s family engaged him as a lawyer to file an appeal in Manipur high court and Supreme Court against the accused. He visited Imphal from March 17 to 19 for the case and following his return, he received WhatsApp calls on March 22 from a person who said he was calling from (the underground) PLA (People's Liberation Army) and "NSCIM" and that he (Bains) should not go ahead with the case. 
 
 Though the lawyer said he informed the SP (CID) Imphal of the calls, DGP LM Khaute said no such report - verbal or written - was made to the SP. 
 
 A   has begun a probe to establish the veracity of the case, the principal secretary said at an impromptu media conference held at the chief minister's secretariat on Thursday.
 
 Khaute said protection would be given to Bains whenever he comes to the state for the case. He added that initial inquiry has revealed the number from which the calls were reportedly made was from Myanmar and that a clearer picture will soon emerge.
 
 "We take the case very seriously and we have extended all our efforts in handling the case and if required we will refer the case to the NIA," said the additional chief secretary.
