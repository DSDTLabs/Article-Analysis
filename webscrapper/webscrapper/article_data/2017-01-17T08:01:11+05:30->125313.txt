VADODARA: When city-based   were called to rescue some puppies that had fallen in a well in   on Saturday, they thought it to be a  . But when they reached the spot, they couldn't believe their eyes. Four puppies that were about six weeks old were resting next to a six-foot long rock python! 

 The reptile that preys on small animals and birds seemed to have developed a liking for the puppies. 
 
 "We had received a call that some puppies were trapped in a 70-foot deep well in Kandari village in Karjan. We reached there and began efforts to track them down. When one of our volunteers, Ketan Raval managed to climb down the well with a rope, he saw this rare sight," said animal activist Neha Patel. 
 
 "The puppies had slipped inside the well from a narrow passage and were trapped inside for last four days. The python, who was in the well, could have easily preyed on them but it rather cozied up to the pups. It was an unusual behaviour by the python," Patel told TOI. 
 
 She was accompanied by other activists including Anil Gohil and   in the rescue operation. The puppies were pulled out of the well in a sack and later the python too was rescued. 
 
 Though non-poisonous, rock python can injure big animals and humans with its bites. It usually preys on large rodents, birds and frogs. 
 
 "The python could have felt threatened by the puppies and easily coiled around them and suffocated them. But the puppies and python had developed an unusual relation. The puppies were cozying up against python who too was protecting them," Gohil said.
