PUNE:   police on Wednesday booked four youths from the Padmavati area for allegedly stalking and molesting a 17-year-old girl for the past two months.

 “One of them caught hold of her bag, while another held her hands. The third suspect attempted to grope her. Their fourth accomplice hurled abuses at the girl,” said an officer from the Sahakarnagar police.
 
 The girl somehow managed to free herself and ran to her house. She lodged a complaint with the police on Wednesday. 
 
 The suspects have been booked under sections 354 (A) (sexual harassment) and 354 (B) (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe her) of IPC and the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
 
 “All the suspects are on the run. We will soon arrest them,” said  , senior inspector of the Sahakarnagar police.
 
 Nikam said the girl’s parents were labourers. “The suspects would pass lewd comments on her,” he said, adding that they would even follow her right up to her home.
