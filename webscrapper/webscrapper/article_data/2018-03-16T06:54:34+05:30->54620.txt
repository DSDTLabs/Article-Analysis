HYDERABAD: An amount of Rs 750 crore has been specifically allocated in the state budget for taking up road repairs in the city.

Municipal administration minister   had later convened a meeting of officials and directed that repairs be undertaken. Finance minister   who presented the budget on Thursday listed 'Hyderabad road development, including GHMC area' among the 34 flagship programmes of the state government. 
 
 "Road repairs need to be undertaken immediately when damages are noticed. Potholes will have to be filled without delay. That will help maintain the condition of roads ," Eatala Rajender said in an interaction with the media after the budget presentation. He said in the villages too if the roads are not maintained well and in time, the entire road would get washed out and it would appear as if a road had never existed there.
