NEW DELHI:   is the most   for   across India during   season, a   conducted in   across the country has revealed. It included 456 critically-ill adults and children. 

 The study found that scrub typhus, encephalitis, malaria and bacterial sepsis were the other common causes for ICU admissions across from August to October. Some of the hospitals include Sir Ganga Ram hospital (SGRH), PGIMER, Chandigarh, Christian Medical College, Vellore.
 
 Researchers said the motive behind conducting the study was to identify the prevalence, reasons and utilisation of ICU resources and outcome of a patient with tropical fevers in Indian ICUs.
 
 “Tropical fevers are caused by number of viruses, bacteria and protozoa and often get transmitted by an insect bite. The challenge lies in clinically diagnosing them at the time of presentation as they often present as undifferentiated fever and with overlapping signs and symptoms,” said Prakash Shastri, one of the authors of the multi-centric study. 
 
 It has been published in a recent issue of The Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine. Shastri, who is vice-chairman of critical care department at SGRH, added that laboratory confirmation may not be available or reliable in first few days for such patients and it is important to treat these patients early as delay leads to increased complications and increased hospital stay and expenditure. 
 
 A report by the municipal corporations of Delhi recently confirmed that 10 people died because of dengue in Delhi last year. Malaria claimed five lives, taking the total number of fatalities caused by mosquito-borne diseases to 15. Across India, health ministry data shows that dengue claimed nearly 250 lives in 2017, compared to 245 deaths in 2016 and 220 in 2015. 
 
 Dr Sunit Singhi, another researcher and part of the multi-centric study said case fatality in ICU patients studies by them was 18.4%.
