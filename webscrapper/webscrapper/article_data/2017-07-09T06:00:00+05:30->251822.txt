KOLKATA:   Netaji Subhas, the only military installation in the country to be named after Subhas Chandra Bose, celebrated its 43rd anniversary on Wednesday. 

 INS Netaji Subhas, the naval base in Kolkata headed by Commodore Suprobho K De, Naval Officer-in-Charge,  , provides administrative and medical cover, logistical support and other assistance as required by outlying naval units. 
 
 The organization predominantly engages with the civil administration to undertake a series of activities throughout the year for raising awareness about the   amongst the local populace. It also conducts regular campaigns in schools and colleges to motivate young minds to consider the service as a viable career option.
 
 Originally known as INS Hooghly, the base shifted to its present location on December 16, 1959. On July 5, 1974, this premier naval establishment was renamed INS Netaji Subhas. The renaming ceremony was performed by Joan Dias, wife of Anthony Lancelot Dias, then governor of West Bengal.
 
 As part of its social responsibility, personnel from INS Netaji Subhas visit old age homes, schools for disabled persons and orphanages to spend time with residents and donate essential items. On the occasion of its anniversary, a barakhana was organized for services and civilian personnel on the campus. Commodore De emphasized upon all personnel to remain committed to the overall vision of the service and continue to liaise with the state administration to implement plans and policies towards enhancing coastal security.
