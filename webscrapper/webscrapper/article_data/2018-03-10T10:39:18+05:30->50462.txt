AGRA: The   is plagued by shortage of ambulances so much so that patients here are forced to share the emergency service with strangers while they are being ferried from one block to the other. Severely rusted and lacking in basic facilities, patients risk catching infections and getting injured during transportation. Hospital sources said there were just two ambulances for more than 1,500 patients that visit the hospital every day.
 
  “I waited for more than 30 minutes to get an  . When it finally arrived, there were many other patients in the vehicle. I squeezed my way inside,” said a 33-year-old patient, who did not wish to be named.
  
  The two vehicles appeared unwashed with corroded stretchers for beds. There are no oxygen cylinders, first-aid boxes or other emergency equipment inside. Patients also said that drivers lock the ambulance door from outside to restrict more people into it.
  
  “We can step out of the ambulance only when the driver unlocks it,” added another patient.
  
  “I made my grandmother sit with many others inside the ambulance. She was ill and could barely sit but we had to manage. More than five patients and their attendants are ferried together at one go,” said  , 33, a resident of   area.
  
  Many also said that summers are most difficult as the ambulances have no air-conditioning or oxygen cylinder to aid the elderly and ill patients.
  
  Dr  , superintendent-in-chief at S N Medical College, said, “We have asked for two more ambulances and they are expected to arrive soon.”
  
  Official sources also cited scarcity of drivers in the facility. “Around eight posts of drivers are vacant. Many of them are also employed to ferry doctors. There are some other ambulances meant especially for VIP services. These vehicles are fitted with monitors, refrigerators, emergency kits and oxygen cylinders,” said an official, on anonymity.
