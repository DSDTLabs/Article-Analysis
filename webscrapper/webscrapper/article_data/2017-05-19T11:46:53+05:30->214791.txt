THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Officials of the   department (MVD) penalised 40   for having illegal fittings on their vehicles.

 The drivers were slapped with a fine during the fortnight-long drive led by transport commissioner S Aananthakrishnan.
 
 The drive against erring three-wheelers was launched based on complaints, especially from women passengers and pedestrians.
 
 While women complained of rickshaws having more rear-view mirrors than the stipulated two, pedestrians raised concerns over jutting pointed objects, fitted as part of the wheel covers.
 
 There were also complaints of fare meters fixed in such a way that passengers could not see them.
 
 Drivers found to be using multiple mirrors were ordered to remove them. MVD also imposed a fine of Rs 500 on them.
 
 “It is illegal to install additional mirrors, pointed objects on the disk of tyres and fancy lights after the registration process of a vehicle is completed,” said Aananthakrishnan.
 
 A city-based auto driver, S Mohankumar, expressed support to the initiative.
 
 “The pointed objects on tyres are dangerous for pedestrians and women passengers do not prefer travelling in autos with additional mirrors. It is a good decision by the MVD to check such  . The decors and mirrors distract the driver also,” he said.
 
 MVDs enforcement wing would be launching another drive against installation of fancy lights in vehicles from next week. Any extra illumination other than the permitted ones would invite action.
 
 The MVD has received several complaints from motorist that such lights acted as distractions while driving.
