VADODARA: Minor stone pelting was reported at   near Godhra on Wednesday afternoon over a petty issue between members of different communities. The police registered an offence regarding the incident and beefed up security in the area.

 The incident took place over an old rivalry regarding the construction of a house by a member of the minority community. The local residents have been objecting to this stating that it is in the middle of the road. The   had earlier razed the house.
 
 “The issue is old and a suit has also been filed in the case. Some trenches have been left behind where the foundations of the house were dug up,” said V K Nayi, Panchmahal’s deputy superintendent of police.
 
 On Wednesday, some locals were filling up these trenches and the family that owned the house objected to it. “The trenches were being filled as people were to visit the area following death of a person there recently. The objection led to an altercation and there was stone pelting,” said Nayi. He added that the situation was brought under control soon and offences were registered by both sides involved in the incident.
