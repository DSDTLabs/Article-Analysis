AMRITSAR: Hoping to take up issues concerning Punjabis and suggest taming the hardliners in   for the sake of peace in  , former inspector general of police (IGP)   has sought an appointment with Canadian Prime Minister   who is scheduled to visit Amritsar on February 21. 

 Displaying his photograph with Trudeau clicked in a Montreal gurdwara during his visit in April 2010, Bhullar on Thursday said he had found Trudeau to be very energetic, a visionary and inquisitive about Punjab, Punjabi culture and Sikhism. "During our meeting, we had interaction on various issues and I was literally fascinated with his worldly and political acumen," said the former cop.
 
 Bhullar said ever since he came to know about Trudeau's Amritsar visit, he wanted to meet him and share issues of Punjabis living in Canada.
 
 He said he sent an e-mail to the consulate general of Canada in Chandigarh on Thursday, seeking an appointment with Trudeau during his visit.
 
 The former IGP said he would want to discuss how he could further win hearts of Punjabis living in Canada and convey him the Sikh gurus' message of 'sarbat da bhala' (wellbeing of all). "I will also want him to tame the hardliners in his country since their acts are inimical to peace in Punjab," Bhullar said.
