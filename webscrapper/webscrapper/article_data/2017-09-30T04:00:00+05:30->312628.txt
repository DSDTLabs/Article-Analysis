Palanpur:  ,   

 Rajendra Kumar Saini (50) was living with his family in Adinath Society. 
 
 On Thursday night, his wife Geeta (46) registered a complaint against his cousin brother Ramesh Saini and wife Pushpa, who live in Bikaner in Rajasthan. Geeta told the police that the couple was demanding their share in his land as well as in the agriculture produce. Rajendra also owned some land in Bhoyan villge near Deesa and Ramesh was asked for Rs 4 crore as their share in this land too.
 
 Geeta said several years ago her husband had sold his agriculture land in Deesa following persuasion by Ramesh and then purchased land in Mandar in Rajasthan. Ramesh was already in possession of this land and was tilling it, she said.
 
 “For the last four months, Rajendra Saini was under severe pressure due to his cousin’s demand. On Thursday, he shot himself with his licensed gun,” the police said.
