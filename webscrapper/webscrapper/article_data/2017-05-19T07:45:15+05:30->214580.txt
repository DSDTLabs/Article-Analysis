CHENNAI: Despite the state's engineering admission process having gone online last year, students and parents from across the state are now turning up in large numbers at Anna University every day for clarifications that range from the basic to the bizarre.

 “Around 20 to 30 aspirants show up every day to ask about the medical and arts admission process.They don't seem to know how it works despite our instructions online,“ says   (TNEA) special officer R Manoharan.   points to make shift helpline officials fielding doubts from a number of applicants. “We've made the process online and even provided mobile access for applications to make things simpler,“ he says. “Yet we have applicants who struggle for an hour to enter even basic details. They have zero knowledge on how to operate a computer or enter an OTP [one-time password].“ But students say glitches plague the online process.
 
 “I was told that once the online application is completed, I would receive a verification mail in two days. It has been a week and I still haven't received a verification,“ student K   says.
 
 Applications errors also require a tedious correction procedure that is done at the campus. M  , a student who had come to make a few changes in his application, says, “I was asked to meet an officer on the first floor. Then I was sent back to the enquiry desk. It took two hours, finally , to make a few minor corrections in my application but my school name is yet to be corrected.“
 
 M Badhusha, a parent, says it's tedious when officials have to manually make corrections. “We request the officials to make the facility available online so that we don't have to wait for long hours,“ Badhusha says.
 
 By Wednesday, the applications had touched 1 lakh.The number is expected to surpass last year's count.
 
 “We received 1.38 lakh applications last year. We are clearly witnessing an upward trend in applications and expect more this year,“ Manoharan says.
