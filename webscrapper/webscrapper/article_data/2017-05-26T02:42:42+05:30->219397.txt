NEW DELHI: Chief minister   on Thursday paid a surprise visit to   in north Delhi’s Mangolpuri and took stock of the facilities, besides interacting with patients.

 Kejriwal was accompanied by health minister   and Mangolpuri MLA Rakhi Birla.
 
 Three days ago, the CM had directed the chief secretary to ensure 100% availability of medicines, consumables and functioning equipment in all Delhi government hospitals.
 
 The CM visited all departments apart from the wards and the pharmacy and talked to quite a few patients. While several of them told him that they were satisfied with the functioning of the hospital, a release from the government stated that a number of them also complained of several problems. 
 
 “I have asked the medical superintendent (MS) to take action. I will also talk to the lieutenant governor in this regard and take appropriate action. I will make more such surprise checks in the coming days. We will make all systemic changes required,” Kejriwal said later. 
 
 He also said few cases of money being taken at some levels were reported to him by the patients and action will be taken after identification. “#AAP will ensure free medicines and treatment to all people visiting government hospital without any discrimination — @ArvindKejriwal,” the party later tweeted.
