Panaji: Government employees travelling by the 5.30pm bus from Panaji market to Margao have written to the state-run Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited (KTCL) demanding a bigger bus for their daily commute.

 The bus service starts between 8-9am with five buses (at 15 minute intervals) from KTCL-Margao and reaches Panaji market by 9-10am. In the evening, however, only one bus takes passengers from Panaji to Margao. “We are all cramped in this one bus. We need at least a 55-seater bus to accommodate all of us,” said one of the commuters, Vrundavan Raikar.
 
 “The bus has a seating capacity of only 38 commuters and the remaining passengers remain standing,” the letter said.
 
 Over 50 employees of Panaji-based government offices, including the Entertainment Society of Goa , directorate of fisheries, department of information and publicity and electricity department, have signed the letter written to KTCL.
 
 A KTCL official said, “This special shuttle bus operates on smaller city roads. Manoeuvring a big bus through such roads or even finding place to park it will be very difficult.”
