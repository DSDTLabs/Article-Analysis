MUMBAI: With the home run in sight, Mumbai City will be looking to bag as many victories as possible in the fourth season of the  . Facing them in their 13th outing are Jamshedpur who are one spot above them in fifth.

 
 Every victory earned from their last six matches would indeed play a crucial role in steering The Islanders towards the semifinal play-offs but Jamshedpur are likely to be thinking along the same lines.
 
 Mumbai have 17 points from 12 games while Jamshedpur have 19 from 13. A win on Budget Day at the   will take the hosts to fourth spot, but depending how the likes of Goa and Pune City get along, coach  ' side may well be hoping for permutations and combinations to work in their favour for them to finish in the top four.
 
 "We have a possibility of top-four spot and a win on Thursday will take us closer towards our goal," said Guimaraes, fully aware his team cannot afford any more mistakes. "Every little detail will make a difference in our push for the top-four spot," added the Costa Rican, who would be happy that his struggling side came away with a high-scoring win in Goa despite his rock in defence   missing the game.
 
 Guimaraes' counterpart,   said his team was under no pressure. "It is not a must-win game for us. It is almost a must-win game," said the Englishman.
 
 For their debut season, Jamshedpur have done fairly well, and Coppell is happy with the team's results, though less so with the level of performance. "No coach will ever be happy with the level of performance. He will always look for more from his team. But, considering everything, we are not in a bad space. We had a few goalless games, then we had a few scoring draws. I would rather take cleansheets," said the Englishman.
 
 A victory for Jamshedpur will be more decisive for the visitors as it would see them catch third-placed Pune City on 22 points. It would, however, sound the death knell for the home team.
