BHUBANESWAR: A group of around 60   on Monday   in front of the   here urging the state government to take preventive steps to stop the   (SCD) in the state especially Kandhamal district.

 A delegation led by Hemanta Naik, convener of   and People Affected by Other Genetic Health Disorder Forum, submitted memorandums to governor Dr S C Jamir and health secretary Dr Pramod Kumar Meherda urging them to start an innovative project to contain the disease that slowly kills the people of Kandhamal.
 
 Naik said thousands of people are suffering from the disease in his district. He alleged that the patients don’t get medicines of this disease in the government hospital of Kandhamal.
 
 “The state government should come up with an innovative project by involving community organisations to create awareness among the people of the tribal areas to prevent the disease. It is seen that people with SCD get married and have children. They don’t know that their genetic health disorder will also create problem for their kids,” he added.
 
 He urged the health secretary to take immediate and concrete steps to contain the disease in the tribal districts like Kandhamal. 
 
 National Health Mission state director Shalini Pandit said the state government is planning to open 10-bed dedicated day care centres at the district headquarters hospital of Kandhamal, Sundergarh and Balasore. Treatment of SCD and blood transfusion facilities will be available there, she added.
 
 She said they have a centre of excellence at Burla in Sambalpur to treat the SCD patients. “We have also a day care facility at Capital Hospital here for treatment and counseling of the patients,” she added.
