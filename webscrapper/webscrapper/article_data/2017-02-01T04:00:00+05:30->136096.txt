Mumbai:   reported a net profit of Rs 2,442 crore for the quarter ended December 2016, down 19% from Rs 3,018 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The bank’s earnings were hit by an increase in  , which slowed interest income growth.

 Announcing the results on Tuesday, the bank’s MD and CEO,  , said that profit growth was lower because the year-ago quarter had an exceptional item arising out of sale of shares in its life insurance subsidiary. Without this Rs 600-crore exceptional item, the increase in profit would have been 3.5%, she said.
 
 Kochhar said that there was a shift towards retail business in recent months. Retail loans now account for 48.9% of the bank’s book and current and savings account deposits are 49.9% of the bank’s deposits.
 
 Gross non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans rose to 7.91% at the end of December, from 6.82% at the end of September and 4.72% a year ago.   rules do not allow banks to recognise interest received from bad loans as income. As a result, the bank’s net interest income for the quarter dropped to Rs 5,363 crore from Rs 5,453 crore a year earlier. The bank’s shares closed down 0.7% to Rs 269 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The results were announced after market hours.
 
 According to Siddharth Purohit, banking analyst at  , the results were in line with expectations. “The comforting factor is that 75% of the slippages has come in from known accounts (watch list). Slippages from the non-watch list corporates was Rs 1,660 crore and remained at similar levels like Q2FY17, which indicates that a large part of the asset quality issues for the bank will remain within the watch list itself. While overall loan growth remained muted, the retail demand continued to be strong — up 18%,” he said.
