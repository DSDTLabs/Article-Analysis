CHENNAI: Bars attached to   outlets in the   of the city have ensured non-stop supply of  , even after the outlets close for the day at 10pm. 

 Residents of Vinayagapuram on Perambur - RedHills Road said liquor was available here round-the-clock though only Tasmac shops are allowed to sell it, that too between noon and 10pm. 
 
 “This has been a menace. I was shocked to see recently a drunk emerging from one such bar asearly as 5.30am and entering another,” said a resident of Vinayagapuram.
 
 A visit by TOI on Monday found that a bar attached to a Tasmac   was operating near   Junction on Jawaharlal Nehru Road well before the opening time. Consumers were found drinking here at 10am. 
 
 While the Tasmac outlet had an entrance from the main road, the bar could be accessed through another side. 
 
 “The shop has been under the scanner of  ,” said another neighbour. “After a brief pause, these bars have started serving liquor.”
 
 Tasmac sources confirmed that such activities were thriving, and they blamed patronage of local politicians. “There are three Tasmac shops at Lakshmipuram, which is in the vicinity of Retteri. Each shop generates Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.50 lakh every day. But these illegal bars earn double that,” said a Tasmac source.
 
 When contacted, a Tasmac official in Tiruvallur district said steps are being taken to close down such bars. “We will ensure stern action,” he said.
