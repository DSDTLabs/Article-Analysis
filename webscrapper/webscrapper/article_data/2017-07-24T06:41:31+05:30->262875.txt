CHENNAI: The first day of the TNEA ( ) general counselling round saw a turnout of 81.75% with 2,329 out of the 2,898 students called for counselling taking part. A number of top rank holders who received their enrollments on Sunday at   said they would be giving the highly-anticipated medical counselling a miss, hinting that fewer students than anticipated may migrate from their allotments here to medical colleges. 

 Of the 162 top rankers, 116 turned up for the counselling, said registrar S.Ganesan.
 
 Sessions that started in the morning saw students thronging to computer science (434 enrollments), electronics and communication (625) and mechanical engineering (403) in particular. With a TNEA rank of 26, G   from Madurai said she had opted for the   programme, along with nearly half the students ranked in the top 20. She was also one of the handful of toppers who had written NEET. "I scored 330, but if I don't get a government college seat, I will continue with engineering," she said, echoing the thoughts of several other students.
