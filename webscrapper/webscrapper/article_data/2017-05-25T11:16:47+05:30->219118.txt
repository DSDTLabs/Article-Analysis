Every aspiring singer dreams of getting an opportunity to sing with their mentor. For  , one of the most versatile singers in Bollywood and the voice behind hits songs like Sau Tarah Ke, Breakup Song,  , that dream has now become a reality with the release of ‘Affu Khuda’. She has lent her mellifluous voice for this new Bollywood track alongside her mentor  . From the soon-to-be released Marathi film ‘Fun Unlimited’, the song presents both singers at their best, singing a remix of the 60s super hit song from the movie  . 

  The song is most certainly a memorable one for Jonita as Sonu Nigam was the first from Bollywood to introduce her to the professional stage. What started with the need for one singer to perform at his public concert in Canada led to an invitation to tour with him around the world. “The way I met him was through an online contest he held in 2009 where I was one of the winners. The result was that I got to be part of a tribute to Michael Jackson in which Sonuji also sang. I was thrilled then, and now my dream of sharing a film song with him has finally come true! I've always looked up to him growing up, and while sharing the stage with him for years now, I never run out of things to learn from him,” said Jonita.
