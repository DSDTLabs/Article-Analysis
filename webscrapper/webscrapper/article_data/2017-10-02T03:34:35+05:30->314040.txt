 Ashok Datar of Mumbai Environmental Social Network said, “There is an urgent need to revive  , formed few years back, but discontinued some months back. It will be a group of like-minded citizens to raise the voice of commuters.”
 
 “We can use the forum to put pressure on the authorities to execute projects which benefit the common man and ensure that the latter gets basic facilities/amenities at railway stations,” he said, adding that the stampede was uncalled for.
 
 A V Shenoy of Mumbai Vikas Samiti said, “We will write on behalf of the forum to Union railway minister Piyush Goyal a charter of demands. A key demand will be to give more powers to Central and Western Railway general managers or divisional railway managers to execute projects here without Railway Board interference. The board can take policy decisions, while implementation of basic facilities/amenities for passengers should be done at the local level. Every file need not go to Delhi for clearance.”
 
 Another senior transport activist said GMs should have powers to implement projects for commuter safety or convenience on priority.
 
 Goyal had met senior officials on Saturday. “Goyal decided to empower GMs to spend money to ensure passenger safety, to check delays in execution of projects and red-tapism,” an official said.
