 Daughter of violinist L Subramaniam and the late singer Vijayshree, Bindu is known for her fusion  , which is an amalgamation of   and western tunes.
 
 For me, it was just a natural form of expression, where I blend classical and western tunes, which I felt was honest and spoke to me. If I had to do only classical music, it wouldnâ€™t be me. I feel, in some way, that I am in between the two genres.
 
  As a woman, I feel you always need to prove yourself a little extra. If you are a musician or an artiste, people just naturally assume that music is your hobby or a part-time job. They just dismiss it naturally. More   are afraid to do something different. If you look at the music industry, women have been struggling. But now they have moved to a point from just being props. We need to be at a point where   has got nothing to do with our talent.
 
  Things are changing now. I see young girls are willing to try something different. Children want to do something different, which is considered normal. I think it also depends on the mentorship and the role models. Women need to have a strong role model because when we look for support, it helps.
