BENGALURU: The   on Friday decided to take control of fee regulation and safety of schoolchildren in   and   in the state.

 Government sources said the decision to regulate the fee structure was taken to curb the exorbitant fees charged in certain reputed private institutes.
 
 At the other end, sexual harassment and child abuse which took place in some CBSE and ICSE schools are said to have prompted the government to take control of the safety aspects in such institutions. Sources said the government will pass common rules and regulations for safety of students in these institutions, including managing safety inside the campus and also on buses ferrying students.
 
 The control over these private institutions will be brought about with an amendment to the   Act, 1983, in the ongoing legislature session next week.
 
 CBSE and ICSE schools said they have not yet heard from the government on fee regulation. They said the government must study the issue before taking a blanket decision. “Schools which impart quality education should not be compared with those who cheat parents. How can all schools be punished because a few are flouting the rules,“ asked a principal. The education department, they said, must categorize schools and identify those fleecing parents. “A good school needs to pay its teachers well. We struggle to get good teachers. Coaching centres and private tuitions have taken away good teachers. If we don't pay them well, how will we run the institution,“ asked the head of another institution.
 
 While principals said the black sheep must be removed from the system, it is not right to brand all schools 'greedy'. A principal said: “Parents are willing to pay for good education.That's the norm across the world. It's the government's job to provide quality education for every child in the absence of which these problems will crop up.“
