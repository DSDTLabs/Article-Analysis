MYSURU: The grandson of philosopher, statesman and the second President of India, Sarvepalli  , visited   on Wednesday.

  Desiraju, former secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, spent nearly an hour at the heritage bungalow in Saraswathipuram where Radhakrishnan once lived. His grandfather taught philosophy at the University of Mysore from 1918 to 1921.
 
 Keshav, who lives in Chennai, visited the All India Institute of Speech and Hearing (AIISH) at the university’s Manasagangotri campus before heading to the bungalow, which was built in 1916. With financial aid from PES Educational Institutions founder MR Doreswamy, the university has restored the structure as “a public centre for philosophy and Indian culture”.
 
 AIISH public relations officer Keerthi Kumar, UoM computer science department head Hemanth Kumar and UoM retired chief librarian Ramasheshu accompanied Keshav. Ramasheshu said Keshav looked at the collection of rare photos of Radhakrishnan displayed at the centre with pride. Keshav was thrilled at seeing the vast collection of books on his grandfather, stored in the mini-library at the centre.
 
 “Keshav spoke in fluent Kannada. He rejected our request for delivering lectures on Indian and western philosophy organized by the university twice a month. Saying that he will not deliver any talk, Keshav said he will attend seminars,” Ramasheshu said. Keshav was given a copy of ‘Tatva dharshana: Sarvepalli Radhakrishnanravara vicharadare’, published in 2014. Ramasheshu said Keshav enjoyed seeing the books penned by his maternal uncle and historian Sarvepalli Gopal.
