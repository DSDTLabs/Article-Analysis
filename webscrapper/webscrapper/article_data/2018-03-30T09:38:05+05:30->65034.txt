BHOPAL: Going beyond their   — research work, scholars of the premier   (IISER) did their bit to   around the institute on health and education issues.

 Students set camps in villages to make rural population aware of health and education under Gaon Chale Hum programme.
 
 Gaon Chale Hum is a programme run by the Central government under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA). To learn about culture in villages and know problems being faced by villagers, a college team set a camp in village Bakaniya, which is 14 km from   campus, said Hanuman Singh Dagur, who is taking care of activities being run under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA). Sourav Datta is the coordinator of UBA.
 
 “The team included 42 students from different states, who are studying in the IISER. We visited village and interacted with villagers. We had discussion with school principal, teachers, sarpanch and students,” Hanuman said.
 
 Narrating their experiences, students say teachers wish to provide high-quality education to students, but school infrastructure is not good.
 
 “From our team, many students delivered lectures on topics, including sports, culture, agriculture, unemployment, health, girl’s education and many more,” Hanuman said. Students told them about how to prepare paper bag, how to use primary health kit and such others.
 
 Students organised drawing, dance, speech and other competitions. Through Prabaht Pheri, students tried to convince villagers about importance of girls’ education. The team has prepared a report on village Bakaniya and sent it to the Prime Minister’s Office.
