Jaipur: Former Jaipur MLA and city Congress president Pratap Singh Khachariyawas on Monday launched an attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious smart city project in the state. 

 He said that the Congress will register a complaint against the state government at Lokayukta to seek probe. Moreover, if party comes to power in the next assembly elections, the matter would be investigated and action would be taken against the officials who were involved in the implementation of the project. 
 
 Khachariyawas accused that the state government and Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) is carrying out Rs 2,600 crore scam and public money is being misused in Walled City area which is already developed.
 
 Khachariyawas said, “In Rs 2,600 crore, the government can develop a new city. The JMC is wasting crores of rupees in the beautification of Walled Ccity. The old stones are replaced by new sub-standard stones,” he added.
 
 He further accused creation of urban infrastructure, including access to clean water, electricity, sewage and modern amenities, does not seem to be the goal of the smart city Project. “In more than 50 % of the colonies water lines are not laid. Project should have been aimed at improving amenities for the urban poor and the middle class,” he added.
