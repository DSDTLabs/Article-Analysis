With   Chief Minister   said that  's movie   will not be released in her state, the Congress on Tuesday said there was a conflict between the central and state governments on the issue.

  
  
 "For us, the release of any film means it has been certified by the censor board ( ). The government of India should ask Vasundhara ji if she is opposed to the Information and Broadcasting Ministry."
 
 "The censor board, which comes under the Ministry, has given a certificate to release the film," Congress leader   said.
 
 "Is she not opposing the central government by not allowing the film to release (in Rajasthan)," he asked.
 
 Babbar said: "This is a conflict between the central and state governments. She should reply to this."
 
 Vasundhara Raje on Monday said  , now rechristened 'Padmavat', will not be released in cinema halls across the desert state.
