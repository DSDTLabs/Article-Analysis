HYDERABAD: With major chunks of   in the city either auctioned or stuck in litigation, the state government is repeatedly hitting a wall in its efforts to find land for its need. The government a couple of days ago decided to identify 50 acres for shifting 'Dharna Chowk' from Indira Park to another location as protests at the venue were severely affect road traffic and causing inconvenience to residents of the area. But sources in   say land free of litigation is not available unless they begin scouring outside in 40-50 km radius of the core city.

 “Though hundreds of acres government and wakf land are available at places like Miyapur and Raidurg within city limits, it's in legal dispute with claims and counterclaims. The government can get only a few acres of litiga tion-free land within the city,“ a revenue divisional officer of the city told TOI.
 
 Even for   rally highlighting the unemployment problem a few days ago, the police suggested that the rally be held at either Shamshabad, Abdullapurmet and Cheriyal in Keesara mandal or at Gandipet, Nagole or Miyapur. Except Nagole, all the other areas are 30 to 40 km from the core city .While the land in Miyapur is in legal tangles, Nagole metro land cannot be converted for permanent `Dharna Chowk` as the land is required for metro rail and `Save Musi' project “Protests and dharnas are held to bring their problem to the notice of the state government and they can meet chief minister after the protest.Even mobilizing the people for protests is difficult without any transportation facilities.Political parties hold meetings in core areas such as Secunderabad Parade Grounds and  , but asking those organising protests to leave the city for their rallies, is not justifiable,“ S Chandrasekhar, founder president of   said.
