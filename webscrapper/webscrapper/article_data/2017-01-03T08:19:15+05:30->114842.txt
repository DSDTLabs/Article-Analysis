 Sunitha Rao, a 38-year-old who narrowly escaped a chain snatching bid at the railway platform at Begumpet last year said that finding a policeman during an emergency is difficult.“Although I stopped wearing gold after the incident, the number of people who told me that there were mobile snatching bids at the  , at peak hours, left me scared,” she said.
