AGRA: Mathura police has registered a case of communal and hate speech against BJP Yuva wing state general secretary and party’s candidate from Maat constituency of Mathura,  .
 
 Confirming the move, ADM, Ravindra Kumar, said cases have been registered against two people, including the BJP candidate, for using indecent words and communal and hate language during public meeting at   Mishra Girls Degree College on Sunday. According to police while addressing the meeting Nishad dubbed himself to be a true follower of "bharat mata" (mother India) and said he would not tolerate any "khilwad" with her. 
  
 Nishad used these words while reacting to UP cabinet minister, Azam Khan's statement dubbing "Bharatmata" a "dayan" (witch). “We cannot tolerate anyone calling Bharatmata a dayan”, he said.
  
 Attacking AIMIM leader  , he said the Mulsim leader was misleading Indian people which again is intolerable. 
  
 He said, "I love Muslims like President, APJ Abdul Kalam but if someone tries to project himself as "Aurangjeb", then I will cut him as I’m also a son of Maharana Pratap". 
 
 He said, "Ganga, Geeta, Gayatri and Gau mata ke sath Cher char bardasht nahi" (can't tolerate any disrespect to Ganga, Geeta, Gayatri and Cow)”.
 
 While attacking Akhilesh, Nishad challenged him on the issue of Ram Mandir and said, “Maa ka doodh piya hai to ek eent masjid ke naam par laga ke dikhao, phir hum tumhe tumahri aukat dikhayenge” (if you are really your mother’s son, put one brick for the Masjid at the Ram Mandir site and then we will show you your real worth).
