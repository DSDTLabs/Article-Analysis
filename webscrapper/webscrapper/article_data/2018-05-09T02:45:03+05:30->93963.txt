NEW DELHI: After 27 years,   witnessed a unique moment on Monday— a   mating a  . In an attempt to produce healthier mixed offspring, 3-year-old white tigress, Nirbhaya, and 5-year old Bengal tiger, Karan, were released into the enclosure for visitors to see.

 The zoo authorities have successful bred two types of tigers in 1991, which resulted in the birth of one white and one Bengal tigers.
 
 Renu Singh, Delhi zoo director, said they were planning this for a while and on Sunday, both the animals were released together for the first time. 
 
 “We had kept them in close proximity with a caged wall between them to see how they react. On Sunday evening, we released them together and they bonded well. One could expect offsprings by wildlife week in October,” she said.
 
 The tigers were released in the open on Monday for the public. The officials said they would not be kept together for too long.
 
 “The tigress was distressed for the last three to four days. The animals need to mate during this period. Once this is over and breeding is successful, we will separate them and they will return to their original enclosures,” said Singh.
 
 The gestation period of a tigress is 110 days and a fully grown tiger can live in captivity for around 20 years. 
 
 The idea behind this is to improve the genepool owing to white tigers having recessive genes, and to reduce inbreeding among them, the zoo official said.
 
 “White tigers have been inbreeding and the Royal Bengal tiger will not only introduce the dominant gene, but also improve the genepool of the offsprings that can either be a white or a yellow tiger,” said Singh.
 
 Nirbhaya is the offspring of a popular   pair at the zoo — Vijay and Kalpana.
