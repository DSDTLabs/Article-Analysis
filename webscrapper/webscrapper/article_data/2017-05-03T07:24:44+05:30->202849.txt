The main ground is - what if the party in power makes up false cases against members of the opposition. The EC had answered it by saying don't consider any cases filed within six months prior to the election. There is an independent authority in the court. This is sufficient protection against false cases.
 
  
  
 
 I haven't seen anything of this kind. From election to election, it has been refined in  . It used to be money under the morning newspapers. Now there are coupons, top up of mobiles, direct payment to wherever you have mortgaged your jewellery or other materials, ingenious method of not paying you within the constituency but outside. 
 
  
 
 
 Normally, in a constituency with 2,50,000 voters, the Commission has only three to five observers. This time in R K Nagar constituency, they brought in 270 observers. If the political parties can have one contact person for bribing 50 voters, in R K Nagar you should have 5,000 observers. If we have not already been shamed enough, I don't know if we are waiting for a 5,000-strong EC observer team to come for us to be shamed more.
 
  
  
 
 Over the years, the spending of the state on developmental activity has enormously gone up. Every such thing is being viewed as an opportunity to knock out money. So it is the opportunity to make illegal wealth being in seats of power which is the driving force. Unless you can stop that, you are not going to stop bribery.
 
  
 
 
 I don't want to blame everybody in TN, but the received wisdom today is that the TN voter expects money to vote. The two major parties in TN which started bribery in a very systematic way have really brought tremendous shame on this state. In the entire country, if you talk about voter bribery, nobody will recall any state except Tamil Nadu.
