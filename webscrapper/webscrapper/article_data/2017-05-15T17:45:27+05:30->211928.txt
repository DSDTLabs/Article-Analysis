Actor Sharwanand had to experience a dud in the form of 'Radha' last Friday after his movie 'Sathamanam Bhavati' went on to win a national award. 

 
 The actor however is very active behind the screen as well. He and his father had acquired business rights of a couple of films earlier and distributed them. This time around, Sharwanand along with his brother has eyed actor Nikhil Siddhartha's upcoming movie 'Keshava', directed by Sudheer Varma.
 
 
 They have bought the rights of the film in Andhra Pradesh for Rs 4 crore. Sharwanand has nose for good scripts be it his own film or films that has other heros. We hope Keshava lives up to the expectations that it generated with the movie's pre-release buzz.
 
 Keshava is made on a strict budget of Rs 3 crore which comes in as a surprise to most of the young filmmakers and actors, given the immense response from public to the film's teaser and trailer. The amount however is what it costed the makers excluding the remunerations of Nikhil and director Sudheer Varma.
 
 
  is the female lead of the movie which has actress Isha Koppikar in a prominent role. Music of the film is composed by Sunny MR.
 
 
 Keshava will open in theatres worldwide on May 19.
