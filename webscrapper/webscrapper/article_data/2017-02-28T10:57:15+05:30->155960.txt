NAGPUR: Former revenue minister and   Eknath Khadse on Monday appeared personally to depose before the Dinkar Zoting commission inquiring into allegations of land grab against him. The deposition is expected to end on Tuesday, sources said.

 The former minister has also moved an application seeking recasting of issues before the commission. This was opposed by counsel for Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), which is party in the case, as the land under question was in its control. The commission is expected to take up Khadse’s application on Tuesday after his deposition ends.
 
 Khadse as well as others present during the proceedings refused to divulge details of what transpired during 90 minutes that the ex-minister was present at the commission office. There were strict instructions that the matter should be kept away from the media.
 
 However, the probe into allegations of illegal transfer by Khadse of MIDC land at Bhosari in Pune district in the name of his wife and son-in-law has taken a curious turn. Starting his deposition last Wednesday before the commission, Khadse is reported to have claimed that he was totally unaware of the land transaction. This claim amounted to reversing his earlier stand that the said land was not government property but purchased from private owner Rasool Ukani.
 
 In a U-turn, he has now claimed he was not aware of the deal till June 6, 2016.
 
 Khadse had resigned on June 4 following the probe ordered by chief minister  . The former minister was accused of conflict of interests while facilitating transfer of the MIDC land for a price of Rs3.75 crore to his wife Mandakini and son-in-law Girish Chaudhari. The opposition accused him of misuse of office as the land’s market price was in the range of Rs 40 crore.
 
 Judge (retd) Zoting sought answers to some questions and is likely to ask a few more on Tuesday, sources said.
