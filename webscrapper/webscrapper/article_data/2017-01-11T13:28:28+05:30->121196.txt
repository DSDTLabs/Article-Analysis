NEW DELHI: Former finance minister   said the BJP government has done a great damage to India's economy which was built with hard work over last ten years of UPA.

 Speaking at the Congress convention against demonetisation,  ,   said people were not talking about various schemes launched by Prime Minister   since they were all forgotten by government itself but were ruing the prevalent social strife and joblessness.
 
 He said demonetisation was a foolhardy step as was the push for digital payments. He said it was the right of a citizen to decide how he should pay for his purchases, citing high prevalence of cash economy in Europe and the US.
 
 The Congress convention adopted a 'condolence resolution' on deaths caused by note ban.
 
 Slamming the note ban, Chidambaram wondered how will the ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes end black money, terror funding or counterfeiting. He said counterfeits of new Rs 2000 notes have already been seized in Indore, Moradabad and Kanpur.
 
 He said the PM had promised to end corruption but the first Rs 2000 notes were seized in Kandla Port Trust and other places in Gujarat.
 
 According to Chidambaram, 15 crore people depend on daily work and 30 crore on daily income in india, and that livelihood has been taken away in 50 days of demonetisation.
 
 He said the farm prices have crashed and farmers are suffering.
 
 "One man takes the decision. He says I am the Fuhrer, I am the leader," mocked Chidambaram.
