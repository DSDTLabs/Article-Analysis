Jaipur: An 80-year-old ex-serviceman is now doing the rounds of courts to prove that he is alive and retrieve his land from the usurpers who grabbed his land in connivance with revenue officials.

 According to Anurag Kalvatiya, counsel for complainant Prahlad Singh, said that he is a native of Hardas ka Bas in Sri Madhopur in Sikar district. He had served in Army from 1961 to 1972. Since he was unmarried after the retirement, he was living with his sister in Haryana. He had 12 bigha of land at his native place. In 1988, a woman named Kaushalya Devi of his village claimed Prahlad Singh is her husband, and is no longer alive. She in connivance with the revenue officials without even seeking a death certificate changed the title of the land.
 
 The woman died in 1999 and her only daughter Mali Devi approached the lower court to get the land in the name of her mother transferred in her name. Prahlad Singh came to know of the fraud only in 2013.
 
 Though the land is still in possession of Singh’s relatives as he was declared dead, he has approached the high court to declare him alive and requested that the land be given to him. The high court on his petition stayed the lower court’s proceedings of transferring the land in the name of Mali Devi and issued notice.
