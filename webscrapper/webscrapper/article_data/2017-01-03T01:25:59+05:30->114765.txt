NOIDA: A broken water pipeline outside the SBI branch office in Sector 61 has washed away the New Year cheer for the residents and commuters who complained that leakage in the last three days has led to   in the area.

 Dr Virendra Singh, Sector 61 RWA president, told TOI that this was a recurring problem. “Every two-three months, we face the same issue because of leakage in the pipeline. It gets particularly difficult when the water is supplied in the mornings between 6am and 9am and in the evenings from 6pm to 9pm. I have been chasing authorities for a solution but officials say they are helpless because of ongoing construction work in the area,” he said.
 
  junior engineer Yogendra Kasana, who is in charge of the area, however, said the problem was brought to his notice late on Sunday evening. “I got to know about the problem late on Sunday evening. We are expecting to fix it by Tuesday evening as repair work is under way,” Kasana said.
 
 According to Kasana, the issue can be resolved permanently only when the ongoing construction work of the 3.8-km elevated road, which will connect Shopprix Mall in Sector 61 with NTPC crossroads near Sector 24, is complete. The 3.8-km stretch is a part of 6-km overhead stretch of Master Plan Road-II, which is being constructed from   in Sector 28, till Shopprix Mall in Sector 61. The Rs 415 crore project is expected to be completed by October this year and it is likely to ensure seamless travel to Ghaziabad, Delhi and Greater Noida.
