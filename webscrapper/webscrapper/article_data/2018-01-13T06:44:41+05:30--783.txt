BENGALURU: Karnataka industries minister R V   has urged Prime Minister Narendra   to declare IT city Bengaluru the second capital of the country, considering its diverse and vibrant culture and geographical position.

 That’s not all. The minister has further sought a bench of the Supreme Court in Bengaluru and also a Parliament-like structure to host the winter session of Parliament.
 
 In a letter to Modi on January 5, the senior   minister justified his demand saying, Bengaluru is located in the southern region which is free from natural calamities and extreme weather conditions. 
 
 “India urgently needs a second capital and Bengaluru is the best place to fulfil that role. A country of India’s size and scale cannot be managed from one location, especially when the government is gearing up for a paradigmatic and radical change in terms of depth of governance, structural reforms, national reconstruction and international partnerships,” he wrote.
 
 The minister has said that Bengaluru with its multifaceted lifestyle, industrial development and technological innovations is an ideal place to become the second capital in the south.
 
 Moments after his ambitious letter went viral, Deshpande was trolled and ridiculed on social media. “...first fix Bengaluru traffic and infrastructure problem. It’s already dying! @CMofKarnataka tell your minister to concentrate on work not on nonsense,” read a tweet by @thatwatcher.
 
 “Election time nautanki. Sir will you announce your constituency   as 2nd capital of Karnataka? Better fix Bangalore infrastructure nightmares,” wrote VinD, another Twitter user.
