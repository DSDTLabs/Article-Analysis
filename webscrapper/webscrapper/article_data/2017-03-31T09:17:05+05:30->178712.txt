New Delhi: The gunning down of a middle-aged woman and her son’s friend by unidentified assailants in southwest Delhi’s Chhawla on Thursday evening appeared to be another chapter in the ongoing gang war in the area. However, police later discounted this view and said they were investigating whether the youth killed was romantically involved with the woman.

 Police are also probing if 45-year-old   is connected with another murder allegedly committed by her son Anshul, who has evaded arrest for several weeks now. 
 
 On Thursday, Dhankar requested Sharad, 24, a close friend of Anshul, to take her to Gurgaon and the two accordingly started off on the youth’s scooter. At Shikarpur village, they were intercepted by armed men on a bike while crossing an isolated stretch. The attackers apparently opened fire and killed them there, the cops said after quizzing the local residents in the absence of eyewitnesses. The two victims appeared to have each been shot four times.
 
 Local police and the Crime Branch have formed teams to conduct a manhunt after registering an FIR for murder.
 
 One of the early lines of investigation, later dismissed, was the possibility of the shooting’s link to ongoing gang wars. In mid-February, the murder of a man named Dinesh, alias Mangu, was captured on CCTV. The footage showed the killers waylaying Dinesh, who was riding a scooter, and shooting him on his forehead. As the man fell off the scooter, one of the assailants, his face obscured by a helmet, was seen pumping two bullets into the man. The police identified Anshul and a criminal from   involved in four other murders as suspects in the case. 
 
 “Anshul is an associate of gangster  , who suspected Dinesh of being an informant of the Jyoti Nandu gang. Manjeet got Anshul to kill Dinesh,” alleged a police officer. The cops had conjectured that Dhankar’s attackers were trying to avenge Dinesh’s murder and possibly mistook the helmet-clad Sharad for Anshul.
