MUZAFFARNAGAR: The   district administration has invoked provisions of the stringent National Security Act ( ) against Bhim Army’s district chief, Upkaar Bawra, for inciting violence during the April 2 Dalit protests ( ). Bawra is currently lodged in the district jail.
 
  The development comes days after   police invoked NSA against former BSP MLA Yogesh Verma, who is dubbed to be the mastermind behind the Bharat Bandh violence in which several vehicles were burnt, two people died and many more sustained injuries. Sources said that Muzaffarnagar police is now preparing a list of perpetrators and may slap NSA on all of them.
  
  Bawra, who had surrendered in the court of the chief judicial magistrate on April 12, was earlier booked by New Mandi police under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 436 (mischief by fire or any explosive substance with intent to destroy house), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty).
  
  Confirming the development, Muzaffarnagar SP Omveer Singh told TOI, “We are preparing to slap NSA on half-a-dozen people who created law and order problems on April 2. We are scanning CCTV footage to identify the culprits.”
  
  Earlier this month, the state government has extended the application of NSA on   founder and chief, Chandrashekhar Azad, by another three months. The period for which the NSA applied on Azad was due to expire on May 2.
