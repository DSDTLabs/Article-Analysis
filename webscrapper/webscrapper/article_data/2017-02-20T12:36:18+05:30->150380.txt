KOCHI: Demanding the dissolution of   (Fefka), Malayalam Cine Technicians Association (Macta) Federation said that the South Indian film actor, who was allegedly raped early on Saturday, is the latest victim to FEFKA’s criminal associations.

 “Fefka is an organization that gives its membership to anyone who will shell out a membership fee of Rs 1 lakh. So there will be criminals among them.   had served as driver to many film actors although he was a historysheeter,”  , general secretary of   said.
 
 Baiju alleged that there was a conspiracy between drivers and a few film industry field personnel and the association of producers had no idea about it. “No cars with the production company will be sent without the knowledge of the production controller, said the Macta statement. “There is a need to investigate this aspect,” said Baiju.
 
 Meanwhile, B Unnikrishnan of Fefka rubbished the claims. “Not all drivers on film sets are from Fefka. None of the suspects in the case are Fefka members. However, five vehicles are allowed for personal use. I haven’t even heard of Pulsar Suni,” he said, adding that the association had no credibility to make such an allegation.
 
 A senior police officer, meanwhile, told TOI that many actors were employing those with criminal history as a safety measure. The officer also hinted that actors carry large sums of money in cash while travelling
 
 “One of the reason for the presence of such ‘thugs’ is a blind belief that they will be able to provide help during emergencies. There are records of many with criminal history working with actors. There were some spats that were reported earlier. The accused involved in the crime Pulsar Suni is a historysheeter and born criminal. His presence is an example of the same,” said a police officer under condition of anonymity.
