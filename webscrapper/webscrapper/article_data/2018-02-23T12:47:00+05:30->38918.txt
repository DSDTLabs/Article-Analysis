All five communities clubbed under MBC were being given the additional quota benefits with ‘special backward classes’ (SBC) certificates.

 The minister was replying to   Dhiraj Gurjar’s charge that Gujjars and four other communities were not being issued MBC certificates by officials concerned, as a result of which youth from these communities were unable to avail quota benefits entitled to them.
