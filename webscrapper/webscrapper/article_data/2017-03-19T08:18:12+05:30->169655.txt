NEW DELHI: A Jaipur girl’s romantic encounter with a Delhi youth on Facebook took an unexpected turn. The 22-year-old brought her to the capital with a promise to marry her and locked her up in a hotel room. The accused, Imraan, was later arrested on the charge of kidnapping and the girl was rescued by the crime branch from Mahipalpur.

 Police said the youth was planning to sell her to traffickers. They are probing if she was sexually assaulted or not.
 
 “Imraan had a Facebook account with a fake name and sent a friend request to the victim. A few months after she accepted his friend request, he asked the girl to come to Delhi to meet him. He also promised that his family would like to meet her so that they could make their relationship official,” said G Ram Gopal Naik, DCP (crime).
 
 Once she left home without informing her family, the latter filed a missing complaint in Jaipur. On March 16, a team of Rajasthan Police sought help from their Delhi counterparts to trace her. An intensive search operation was conducted in Gari, Mahipalpur and Vasant Kunj and the accused was finally arrested from Mahipalpur.
 
 The victim had arrived in Delhi from Jaipur on March 14 after her communication with the accused on Facebook and WhatsApp, said the officer.
 
 During the inquiry, it was revealed that she was forced to stay in a rented house at Mahipalpur.
 
 “When the victim came to know the real nature of Imraan, she resisted and refused to live with him. But she was beaten up and her mobile phone was snatched by Imraan,” said the officer.
