JAIPUR: The Ajmer Dargah represents Islam in India, says author  , while discussing the life and teachings of 12th century shrine of   at the   (JLF) session, ‘Khwaja Gharib Nawaz: A Message of Love,’ on Monday.

 Dehlvi was conversation with Imtiaz Ali, Reema Abbasi and Syed Salman Chishty. “Indian Islam is very organic and very much rooted in the sub-continent. It is the Mecca of my heart,” said Dehlvi, while explaining her spiritual connect with Islam. While defining the plurality of Sufi Islam, Dehlvi said that 108 verses of Chishti order saint Baba Farid, whose shrine is in Pakpattan, is part of Guru Granth Sahib.
 
 Chishty, a khadim (priest) at Ajmer Dargah, spoke about the unconditional love given to everyone who visits the shrine. “The free meal service, which has lasted 800 years, highlights the importance of equality. Here vegetarian food is prepared in two big cauldrons for people of every faith and belief,” said Chishty.
 
 Bollywood director Imtiaz Ali took the opportunity to narrate the purpose behind the Sufi’s visit from Iran to Hind. “He came to India at the age of 52. It appears that Hindu scriptures and Indian philosophy attracted him to Hind,” said Ali, who drew comparisons between Sufism and Hindu philosophy. “The song ‘Kun Faya Kun’ from my movie ‘Rockstar’ was taken from the Quran. The literal meaning of this verse is similar to the hymn of creation in Rig Veda,” said Ali.
 
 Replying to a question on what advice should Sufis give to those staging a protest against the presence of Bangladeshi writer-in-exile Taslima Nasrin outside the JLF venue, Chishty said, “Hate attracts hate.”
