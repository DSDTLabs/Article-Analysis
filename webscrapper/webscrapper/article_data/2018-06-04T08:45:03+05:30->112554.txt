LUDHIANA: Long   continue to be a major problem for residents of Ludhiana. Even on Sunday, power cuts took place for four to five hours. As a result, people in different areas had to suffer immense heat. Power cuts mostly occurred in Jalandhar Byepass, Salem Tabri, Gill Road, Model Town, and BRS Nagar.

 Officials of   State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) claimed they were fixing poles broken due to the storm a few days ago. Jalandhar Bypass resident   said: “I am a housewife. I have to make breakfast, lunch, and do many other household chores, which I’m not able to do without power, so it is really difficult for me to perform all my daily tasks with such power cuts.”
 
 Factory owner   said: “Due to these power cuts, sometimes we have to face heavy losses. Without electricity, our workers can’t work, which affects their production. They can’t preserve their goods for a long time without power.” Salem Tabri resident Geeta added: “The government has to take some serious steps regarding this problem, because due to these cuts, shopkeepers, housewives, and children all have to suffer. And when we call the electricity board officials, they don’t even respond.”
 
 PSPCL chief engineer   mentioned: “I am not aware of areas where power is off, but when somebody contacts me, I am always there to fix the problem. By next week, we will have 20 additional phone lines, so people can contact us easily. The Punjab government has sanctioned Rs64.82 crore for strengthening the power distribution network of Ludhiana city. This project will change the power situation of Ludhiana, and we are putting in our entire effort to make this project successful.”
