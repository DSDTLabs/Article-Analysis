Coimbatore: In line with its decision to restructure the administrative setup of educational officers at the district level to ensure effective monitoring of schools and quality of education, the state government has now bestowed powers on joint directors (JDs) to administer schools in a region. The joint directors will be moved from the department headquarters and they will be given powers to administer all kinds of schools in a particular region, said an official source with the school education department. “The revenue districts in the state will be divided into six regions and a joint director will be asked to look after a region,” the official said. So far, joint directors had been administering schools based on their type. This move is expected to improve the monitoring of the education system as chief educational officers (CEOs) would come under the direct supervision of joint directors, a source said.  The school education department had recently issued a circular to bring all types of schools in an educational district under the supervision of district educational officers (DEOs) and the schools in revenue district under the supervision of CEO. As per the circular, the posts of inspector of matriculation schools, district elementary educational officer and inspector of Anglo Indian schools would be converted into the posts of DEOs, who would monitor all the schools in a particular territorial jurisdiction. tnn
