AMRITSAR: On the eve of the   budget session, ‘jathedars’ appointed by the   have sought that the committee members be made accountable for the incidents of desecration of Sikh scriptures and security of gurdwaras in their respective areas.

 Talking to TOI on Tuesday, ‘jathedar’ of Takht Damdama Sahib Baljit Singh Daduwal alleged that SGPC members were largely involved in politics whereas they should be working in their respective areas for the propagation of Sikhism.
 
 He stated that they had asked the general house of the SGPC to ensure that every member was made accountable for the incidents of disrespect to Guru Granth Sahib or other Sikh scriptures. “SGPC members should also keep a record of number of gurdwaras and Guru   in their area and ensure implementation of maryada (Sikh code of conduct),” he maintained.
 
 Daduwal said till date a large number of gurdwaras had not installed CCTVs for round-the-clock security of the premises and the holy books despite several appeals made both by the SGPC and the Akal Takht. He suggested that the SGPC should also make public the offerings and help received from those running ‘kar sewa’ (voluntary service). Citing an example, he said, “During various religious functions organised by the SGPC, langar was offered by those doing ‘kar sewa’ during Baisakhi function held at Takht Damdama Sahib but the expenses were shown in the SGPC’s account.”
 
 He futher said that the Sikh clerics had also demanded recovery of Rs 90 lakh from former SGPC president Avtar Singh Makkar for spending on advertisements of pardon granted to   chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim by the Akal Takht. “The money belongs to ‘sangat’ (community) and not ‘Panth dokhi’ (guilty of misconduct), so it should be recovered from Makkar and others responsible for spending it,” he quipped.
