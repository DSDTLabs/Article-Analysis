Tirunelveli: Eight fishermen from Kanyakumari, Tuticorin and Tirunelveli districts who were detained in Kish Island in Iran for 120 days will be returning home through Chennai on Wednesday morning. They are among the 15 fishermen who were working in Dubai.

 “There was lot of confusion in getting them released, as the agent who sent them to Dubai and their employer in Dubai wanted them to come back for work for him. But the fishermen were not ready to go there as they were forced to involve in illegal fishing,” claimed president of the International Fishermen Development Trust (INFIDET), P Justin Antony.
 
 Antony, who has been following the issue since the detention added that the long-fought struggle by the fishermen through repeated audio and video messages in WhatsApp has now yielded results with their release. “Eight people who went fishing have been released and will reach Chennai early on Wednesday morning. Six other fishermen who went fishing in the second boat will also be released soon,” he added.
 
 The fishermen released on Tuesday were identified as S Alfred Newton Sahayam, 37, and T Jude Frank Herban, 23, of Rajakkamangalam, T Siluvai, 34, of Puthenthurai, and J John Prakash, 31, of Mandaikadu Puthoor in Kanyakumari district, G Yonas, 32, of Tuticorin, and C Gladwin, 54, S Chenkiskhan, 27, and R Udhayaa Kumar, 44, of Uvari in Tirunelveli district.
 
 They flew from Kish to Dubai at 9.10am (Iran local time) on Tuesday. They will start from Dubai at 10.55pm on Tuesday and reach Chennai at 4.25am on Wednesday.
 
 On October 24, 2017, they were fishing in two boats when they accidentally strayed into the territorial waters of Iran and were detained by Iranian Coast Guard.
