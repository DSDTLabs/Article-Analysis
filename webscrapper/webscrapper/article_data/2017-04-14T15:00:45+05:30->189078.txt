NEW DELHI: Putting on a brave front after 
  in miserable fashion, AAP chief   concluded after a post-mortem today that voters were upset the party's sitting candidate contested in the Punjab Assembly polls.

 Jarnail Singh resigned as a legislator from the Rajouri Garden constituency in Delhi to contest assembly elections in Punjab in February. He lost. And this move led to AAP's bypoll loss yesterday.
 
 Deputy chief minister   also admitted yesterday that the vote reflected anger against AAP. He, too, added that the anger was over the party's decision to have sitting legislator Jarnail Singh contest in Punjab rather than at the performance of the AAP government.
 
 Yesterday, not only did the AAP bypoll candidate Harjeet Singh lose the Rajouri Garden seat to the  , he didn't even get enough votes to recover his deposit and had to forfeit it.
 
 Harjeet managed to get just 10,243 votes, even as the winning BJP candidate Manjinder Singh Sirsa got a whopping 40,602 votes. The   party, which came in second, garnered 25,950 votes. Sirsa regained the constituency that he had won before, in 2013. 
 
  Kejriwal said today that the bypoll's results would not impact the municipal polls, as the issues involved are different.
 
  "After winning 282 seats in the Lok Sabha, BJP too lost many bye-elections," Sisodia said yesterday. He added AAP would tell people about the good work the government has done and win the corporation polls handsomely.
