Taking its efforts to leverage technology in education, CBSE has now launched a mobile app for students to locate their board exam centres. With CBSE’s X and XII exams starting from March 9, this new app called Exam Centre Locator (ECL) App will use GPS technology to geo-locate the student’s centre. A student can easily find the address and images of the designated exam centre on the map and know how to reach using the inbuilt access to online maps. To start using ECL, a student or a parent has to register through mobile number to receive an OTP (One time password) number. The student or parent can then access information by selecting the option Std X or Std XII and entering the roll number.
