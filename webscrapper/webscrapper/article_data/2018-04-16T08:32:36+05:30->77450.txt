LUCKNOW: In a study, King George’s Medical University’s ( ) paediatric orthopaedic department has found a biomarker (chemical) in blood which if tested within four hours of injury caused to a child, can help in early diagnosis of compartment syndrome and save the child from limb amputation.

 Compartment syndrome is a condition after an injury in which internal bleeding or swelling builds up pressure that causes a dangerous condition which may lead to amputation as only treatment.
 
 The syndrome under trauma usually develops in the forearm or leg.
 
 In the research spanning over five years, head of peadiatric orthopaedic department, Prof  , found that if the biomarker — creatinine kinase — is tested to be six times higher or more in the blood after injury, compartment syndrome can be suspected.
 
 “Compartment syndrome in trauma happens to both adults and children but in children, it is difficult to diagnose. Some of them are not able to explain the pain and others are not co-operative, which leads to loss of time, when the situation to amputate can be avoided,” said  .
 
 “We tested the findings of the study and progress of the results on 56 patients, and found that the biomarker was 10 times higher in these patients. So if within four hours of an injury, the test is run for the biomarker and it is found to be six times higher or more, treatment should be headed towards compartment syndrome,” he added.
 
 Prof Singh said that test for biomarker is inexpensive and can be performed at any laboratory.
 
 Prof Singh recently presented the study at the 20th Asia   2018, at   in Turkey.
