Actor Joe   says he 'never wanted' to be in a high-profile relationship until he met ' ' star  . 

 The 40-year-old actor, who tied the knot with Vergara in 2015, reveals he knew the Colombian-American model was the only woman for him from the moment they met. 
 
  
  
 "I was never part of a celebrity couple before this, because I never wanted to go through the difficulty that can bring in terms of paparazzi and attention. The two of us knew that once it became public that we were together - and we had conversations about how that would change a lot of things."
 
 "(Sophia) is the only woman on the planet that I was willing to go through all of that for, because she's the greatest," he told. Despite not wanting his relationship to be in the spotlight, Manganiello admits the "pressure" of media attention has actually worked in their favour as it has only brought the couple closer. 
 
 "All that pressure has just brought us closer together. It's not something that we welcome into our lives. We try to stay private. At the end of the day, it's really nobody else's business but ours."
 
 "It's just that I love her and she loves me and here we are. And there is a price for that, when living in the public eye," he says.
