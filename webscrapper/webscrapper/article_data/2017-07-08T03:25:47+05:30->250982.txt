KOLKATA:  , which carry a mammoth traffic from Howrah to the central business district, will be closed to traffic for three days from Friday midnight. The vehicles bound for Kolkata will be diverted to Foreshore Road. But since the approach to   from the Howrah side is saturated, it is unlikely that commuters will get respite from snarls.

Central Kolkata-bound buses can avail Strand Road but south Kolkata-bound vehicles need to go via Vidyasagar Setu. North Kolkata-bound vehicles can avail Strand Road and MG Road. From Saturday morning, parking won’t be allowed on N S Road, MG Road and Strand Road. Tram services will be suspended on M G Road, Strand Road, Rabindra Sarani and B B Ganguly Street.
 
 Meanwhile, Afcons has started serving notices to other seven unsafe buildings for immediate reinforcement of structures. The engineers have started putting structural supports to different parts of the building at 111, N S Road, one of the seven unsafe buildings. Grouting of the foundation will be carried out. The structural distress of the building will be recorded and the residents will be temporarily shifted to a hotel. The buildings will be completely evacuated on July 11.
