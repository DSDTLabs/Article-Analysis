PATNA: A 13-year-old girl was allegedly kidnapped and gang-raped by her two minor neighbours when she was returning from a marriage function in the village under the   police station area in Patna district around 11.30pm on Thursday. The survivor returned home in a devastated condition early Friday morning and informed her family members, who lodged a complaint with the police. Both the accused, in 14-16 years age group, were arrested,   said.

 “Both minors were sent to juvenile home. The accused have confessed to their crime,” the SHO said, adding the survivor was sent to local hospital for medical check-up.
 
 In another incident, a 16-year-old boy has been arrested for allegedly raping his eight-year-old niece under the Mirganj police station area in Gopalganj district around a week ago. The girl’s father lodged an FIR after infection spread in the survivor’s private parts.
 
 Mirganj police station SHO   told this newspaper that the incident took place a week ago when the survivor’s paternal uncle on the pretext of giving sweets called her to a secluded government school near home and raped her. “The survivor narrated her ordeal to her parents. But fearing stigma, they did not report the matter to the police. After her condition deteriorated on Friday morning, her parents lodged a complaint against the accused,” he said.
 
 The accused was booked under Section 317 of the Indian Penal Code (child abuse) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The girl was admitted to Gopalganj sadar hospital and was kept under observation.

On April 14 midnight, a 17-year-old girl from Hilsa in   district was allegedly gang-raped near GPO roundabout under the   police station area in Patna. While two of the accused — Chotan Kumar and   — were arrested a day after the incident, the other others — Monu Kumar and Bauwa Kumar — surrendered before at a special POCSO court here on Wednesday.
