BATHINDA: The long-drawn conflict between Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and Bhai Roop Chand Langar Committee over control of 161 acres of land at   in   was resolved on Wednesday after a successful mediation by the Bathinda zone inspector general of police (IGP) M S  . Both the SGPC and the langar committee have agreed to maintain peace.

 Violent clashes had taken place between the SGPC task force and the langar committee members in 2016 over control of the land. Since April 1 this year, the langar committee had not allowed the SGPC men to enter their area.
 
 “As per the agreement, the SGPC will take control of the land and would offer it on lease. It will provide 90% of the lease money to the langar committee, while keeping the rest of the amount. Since the land could not be given on lease in the current financial year, the SGPC will cultivate it for which the lease money has been fixed at Rs 45 lakh. SGPC will give Rs 40.50 (90%) lakh to the langar committee,” IGP Chhina told TOI.
 
 Bhai Roopa Chand Langar Committee president   said, “We wanted to take control of the land but as per the prevailing circumstances and to maintain peace, we have agreed to receive 90% of the lease money. This will be spent as per wishes of the gurdwara of our village and the langar committee. We will not disrupt the SGPC or any lessee cultivating the land.”
 
 SGPC additional secretary Kewal Singh said that since the langar committee had agreed to not cause any trouble, it was agreed that 90% of lease money be given to them.
 
 Chhina said, “The police and district administration will ensure that the agreement works and that no party creates a problem. Police will keep an eye over developments till everything returns to normal.”
