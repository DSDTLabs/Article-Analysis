FAIZABAD: A   leader was booked along with a few others for announcing a   of Rs 20 lakh for anyone who would behead former SP MLA Azim Ul Haq.

 A letter with this announcement allegedly issued by Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV) leader Surya Mani, who is lodged in Basti jail, went viral on social media.
 
 Those booked include HYV leader Arvind and a few others, said SHO Tanda Kotwali Wakeel Singh. 
 
 Haq, a former MLA from Tanda, Ambedkarnagar, was allegedly involved in the murder of HYV leader Ram Babu Gupta five years ago. However, he was given a clean chit in police investigation.
 
 “We took the matter seriously as it may spread communal tension and affect law and order,” said Brijesh Kumar, PRO to Ambedkarnagar’s superintendent of police. 
 
 “However, the authenticity of the said letter cannot be confirmed. We can’t say if it came from the jail and was written by the said person or not,” he added.
 
 In the letter, Mani has also appealed to make cow protection a priority and go to any extent for it.
 
 Gupta’s widow   had defeated Haq on Tanda seat in the assembly elections contesting on a BJP ticket.
