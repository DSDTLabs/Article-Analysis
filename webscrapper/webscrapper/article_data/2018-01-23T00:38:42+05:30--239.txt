MUMBAI: The Bombay   on Monday told the state government to take stringent action against “overcrowding” of school buses and send   to check these.

 A bench headed by Justice Naresh Patil was hearing a PIL by PTA United Forum seeking action against buses violating the rules under which permits are issued. The judges said school buses that carry children beyond their capacity must be dealt with stringently and their licenses cancelled. “Give them a warning that it will be taken very seriously,” said Justice Patil. 
 
 To the court’s query, the government’s advocate replied that there were no flying squads to check school buses for violations and overcrowding. “You must have mobile squads to check for overcrowding,” said the judge.
 
 The petitioners’ advocate said Motor Vehicle Rules mandated a transport committee of representatives of  , school, and the transporter in every school. 
 
 The judges directed the state to ensure such committees were set up in all schools.
