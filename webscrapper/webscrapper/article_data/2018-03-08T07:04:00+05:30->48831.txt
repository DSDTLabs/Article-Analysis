Greater Noida: A day after Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) threatened to cancel the allotment of 100 acres of land belonging to BSP chief Mayawati’s Bahujan Prerna Trust for non-payment of dues amounting to over Rs 110 crore, the Authority set up a committee to investigate if there were any irregularities in transfer of the land to the trust. The committee has been set up by   CEO Arun Vir Singh upon the direction of Authority chairman Prabhat Kumar who also holds post of divisional commissioner Meerut. The committee is to submit its findings within the next 15 days.

 According to YEIDA CEO, the 100 acres of land was allotted to a real estate company on March 27, 2011 but this company transferred the land to Bahujan Prerna Trust within two months. “The real estate company transferred the land soon after paying YEIDA 10% of allotment money as registration fee,” said Singh. “Before we could issue the allotment letter, which is issued after Authority receives 10% + 20% (30%) of land cost or full payment of land cost from the allottee, the land was transferred to the trust on May 27, 2011. We then received Rs 18.38 crore (20% of land cost) from the trust on May 28, 2011.”
 
 Singh said they need to examine how was the land transferred by the original allottee without this condition of depositing 30% cost of land to YEIDA. “A committee has been set up. The issues under the committee’s scanner will be whether norms were followed while transferring the plot to the trust and whether the conditions of YEIDA brochure were followed,” the CEO said. “I have asked the OSD to submit the report of the committee within the next fortnight. If any irregularities are uncovered the officials concerned and the allottee will be brought to book.”
