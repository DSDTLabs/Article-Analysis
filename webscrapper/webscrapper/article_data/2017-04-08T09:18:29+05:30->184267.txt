PANAJI: Curchorem MLA Nilesh   was reappointed as the chairman of the   on Friday, ruling him out of a ministership. In the cabinet expansion expected next week, Dabolim MLA Mauvin Godinho and former   neta and its MLA Vishwajit Rane, who joined   on Thursday, may find themselves being inducted into the Manohar Parrikar government. 

 Sources said Cabral, who is considered to be close to Parrikar, was in the race for ministership. But with him being sent as the   chief, both Godinho and Rane are the front runners to join the Parrikar team.
 
 Currently, the Parrikar cabinet is 10-member strong, which includes the chief minister and there are two more cabinet berths that can be filled. Of the nine ministers, only two are from the BJP and the party is expected to induct two more from its fold into the cabinet. 
 
 Cabral confirmed to TOI that he has been reappointed as the GTDC chief but said the board was not fully reconstituted. “The board would be reconstituted shortly,” he said.
 
 Late on Friday, the Parrikar government also issued an order appointing Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienkar as chairman of the Economic Development Corporation (EDC). Santosh Kenkre, a chartered accountant by profession, has been appointed its vice-chairman. 
 
 Other members appointed on EDC board include Sandeep Bhandari, Ralf D’Souza, Purshottam Pednekar, Shivprasad Manerkar, a representative of IDBI and the finance secretary or his nominee from the finance department.
