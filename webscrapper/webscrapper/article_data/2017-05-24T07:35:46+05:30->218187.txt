PUNE:   who are unable to pay the fine immediately will now have to surrender their driving licences to the police. The motorists will get their licences back on paying the fine either digitally or at the nearest Vodafone Store, with whom the   have a tie-up.

 The stringent system is being rolled out from Wednesday across all traffic divisions in the city. The police will soon get an additional 300 swipe machines to ensure cashless payment of fines.
 
 The digital payment of challans was officially rolled out in the city on April 5 with the challan books being replaced with swipe machines. However, in case of non-pa yment of fines, the traffic department was till now not exercising its powers of seizing driving licences. This resulted in only a small percentage of the penalties actually being recovered since the digital payment launch (see box).
 
 Now, with the induction of a fresh batch of swipe machines, no leniency is expected for rule breakers, who will now have to pay the fine on the spot with their debitcredit cards or surrender their licences.
 
 Police commissioner Rashmi Shukla said, “This is a step towards change. Not only will the e-challan system reduce the hassle of handling cash and issuing receipts, it will directly put an end to all allegations of corruption.“
 
 Past offenders too won't be able to get away, an official said.
 
 
 
 
 Making vehicle users surrender their licences for non-payment of fines is a welcome step which will make rule enforcement more stringent. There has been a pressing need for an effective deterrent since the police were not even seizing the licences of those who did not have the cash to pay the fines. With the new system in place, the police should now create the fear of the law in the minds of those who do not even blink while violating traffic rules. Enforcement also needs to be visible at night.
