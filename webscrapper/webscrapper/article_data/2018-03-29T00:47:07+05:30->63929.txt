Tirupur: As per the high court direction, the city corporation has closed a six-storey building of a private textile showroom on Kumaran Road here for 24 hours as a punishment for deviating from the original building plan approved by the Local Planning Authority (LPA).

 While hearing the PIL filed by V P Ravichandran, a social worker, the HC directed the authorities to seal the building, owned by Siva Textiles, for 24 hours as it violated the corporation and the LPA rules. 
 
 “Though the LPA approved to construct the building in 4,735sqft (440sqm), Siva Textiles’s owner had constructed it in 10,650sqft (990sqm). Besides, it was supposed to be four-storey building but it was constructed for six-storey, including an underground floor. They did not obtain permission to the underground floor but they have built it and made as parking lot, which was supposed to be in the ground floor as per the original plan,” said Ravichandran.
 
 “The corporation, as per an RTI reply, was collecting tax only for 440sqm instead of actual 990sqm,” he added.
 
 When contacted, a senior corporation official told TOI that “Any deviation from the approved plan is a violation. Being shareholder of the legal powers (along with LPA), we had sealed the building for 24 hours, from 10.30am on Tuesday, as a punishment directed by the HC. The showroom has got a grace period, from the HC, to regularise the building by June first week. Actual plan should be submitted before the LPA, which would decide the fate of the building based on whether the plan meets the guidelines .”
