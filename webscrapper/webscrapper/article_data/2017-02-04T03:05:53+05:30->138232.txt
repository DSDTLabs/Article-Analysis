KOLKATA: The five ongoing   Railway projects in Kolkata have received Rs 2,557 crore in this year’s Budget. As anticipated, the biggest gainers have been the E-W corridor, Noapara - Dakshineswar - Barrackpore and   links. Metro plans to commission the links up to Dakshineswar and the Airport from Noapara as well as the phase I of the E-W corridor — between Sector V and Sealdah — by June, 2018. 

 The E-W corridor has been allotted Rs 1,937 crore in the Budget. According to an official, this will be sufficient for the completion of phase I. While track laying is nearly complete on viaducts, rails are being welded in the underground stretches, he said. Work in Howrah for phase II is also progressing as per schedule. Allocation for the Noapara-Barrackpore stretch has been Rs 100 crore while the Noapara-Barasat link has received Rs 220 crore. These projects had received Rs 55 crore and Rs 125 crore, respectively, in last year’s Budget. 
 
 “The project cost for the 18-km Noapara-Airport-Barasat is Rs 3,159.59 crore. Till March 2016, the spending was Rs 190.21 crore. This is because there has been no work beyond the airport towards Barasat. The progress of work between Noapara and the airport picked up in the last few months after the state government took the initiative to relocate encroachers. The project cost for the 14.5km Noapara-Baranagar-Dakshineswar-Barrackpore is Rs 2,069.60 crore. Till March 2016, only Rs 152.50 crore could be spent since no work was possible beyond Baranagar towards Barrackpore. As a result, the allocation of Rs 55 crore for 2016-17 was revised to a mere Rs 1 lakh. This year’s allocation of Rs 100 crore will come in handy as work is now progressing at a fast pace between Noapara and Dakshineswar (via Baranagar) after the state’s intervention,” a senior Metro Railway official said. 
 
 Allocation for the 32km   has remained largely unchanged. In 2016, this project got Rs 248 crore and it has received Rs 250 crore this year. Till March 2016, the spending for this Rs 4,259.50crore project was a mere Rs 865.25 crore. The 2016 allocation of Rs 248 was also revised to Rs 230.10 crore. While no deadline has been set for completion of the project, Metro Railway plans to commission the stretch between New Garia and Ruby by June, 2018. According to the official, the project has faced trouble regarding its alignment but most of that has been resolved.
 
 The worst off has been Joka-BBD Bag stretch where progress has been extremely slow. This project received only Rs 50 crore in 2017 as compared to Rs 90 crore in 2016. Till March, 2016, spending for this Rs 2,913.50 crore project was a mere Rs 383.05 crore. The official pointed out that progress has improved ever since KMC and the government started helping in removing encroachers.
 
 “It is evident that there has been progress from the fact that the original allocation of Rs 90 crore for 2016 was revised to Rs 164.99 crore during the year. If all goes well, the allocation of Rs 50 crore for 2017-18 will also get revised. We have been assured that lack of funds will not be an impediment for any of the projects,” the official added.
