Thane: After numerous technical glitches, the state board announced its first   list for   on Tuesday.

 Out of the 1.77 lakh plus students who appeared for the examination in the academic year 2016-17, as many as 32,503 secured a distinction in the Thane division while 49,379 got a   class. 
 
 While the cut off percentage of Shubham Raje, M H College and IIT Pace (Thane) increased by around 0.8 percent to around 7 per cent, other junior   here showed no significant difference as compared to last year despite the rise in students’ performance this year.
 
 The most significant increase in the cut off percentages was seen in colleges offering science degrees. 
 
 Ekta Harshawardhan, principal of IIT Pace junior science college (Thane) said, “Though the cut off has risen, only 371 out of 720 seats were filled in the first   compared to last year’s record of 600. This time, we even have one applicant who had secured 100 per cent in her class X examination. So we are happy with the quality of students that are applying and are hoping the seats will get filled up quickly in the next lists.” 
 
 It was observed that Thaneites preferred Mumbai colleges to city-based ones for commerce and arts stream. Those opting for science chose local colleges. The last day to claim admission based on the first merit list is July 13. The second list will be displayed on July 20.
