HYDERABAD: Stating that the existing rules allow a person to seek modification of his date of birth within three years of noticing the anomaly in the records, the   has dismissed an appeal filed by a resident of Warangal on the grounds that it is time barred as it was filed 19 years after the date of birth was recorded in school records. The bench of Acting Chief Justice   and Justice   said this while dismissing an appeal by   of Warangal. 

   's father could not ensure that the correct date of birth was entered in school records while admitting him in school. As a result, his date of birth was wrongly mentioned as September 4, 1982 instead of May 4, 1982. He made an application in the year 2016 for correction of his date of birth. However, as per GO 430 dated Dec 31, 1992, the period allowed to file an application to change or alter the date of birth is three years. Stating that he was preparing for the civil services examination for which the upper age limit is 35 years, he made an application to the authorities concerned requesting for correction of his date of birth. Though the difference is a mere four months beteween the original date of birth and the recorded date of birth, he was insisting on modifying it because the recorded age will render him ineligible for the ensuing   exams.
 
 The government authorities rejected the request as the application for correction was made after lapse of 19 years. Challenging the same, he filed a petition before the high court and a single judge dismissed the plea saying that the petitioner completed post graduation on the basis of the date of birth mentioned in the school records at the time of admission. "He cannot attribute lack of knowledge; the petition was filed only when he realised that he would be crossing the maximum age prescribed by the UPSC for attending the exam," the judge observed.
