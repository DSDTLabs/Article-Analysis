PANAJI: Differences between the BJP and its alliance partner the GFP seems to extend beyond the demand for the installation of the statue of Opinion Poll stalwart Dr   in the assembly complex.

 On Tuesday, TCP minister and GFP president   questioned as to why the BJP thought of only discussing the issue of the statue and not about the sharing of the   waters in its executive meeting, on Monday. "Can the issue of the statue be discussed and that of Mhadei be ignored? We will pursue the issue of Sequeira's statue," he said, adding that Mhadei cannot be ignored.
 
 "In the past, the fear was that of a merger with  . Now the fear is of this merger. If Mhadei gets diverted then we will have to merge with Karnataka," he said.
 
 Expressing his disappointment over the resolution passed by the BJP, rejecting his party's demand that Jack Sequeira's statue be installed in the assembly complex, Sardesai said, "My demand remains unchanged."
 
 GFP spokesperson Trajano D'Mello expressed happiness that two of the party's demands - that of observing January 16 as Asmitai Dis and including the Opinion Poll in the school syllabus - have been accepted by the government. On the third demand, the party president will pursue it as there is huge support, he said.
 
 "Sardesai has always stood for 'Goem, Goemkar and Goemkarponn," D'Mello said, adding that Sardesai's family was active in seeking the Opinion Poll of 1967, and he has always supported honouring the 'heroes of the Opinion Poll'. GFP also took umbrage to former CM Laxmikant Parsekar's statement as to why Sardesai was silent on the issue all these years.
