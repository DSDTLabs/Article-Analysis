Mumbai: For the first time, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) weekly disclosures failed to divulge its asset-liability figures as on June 30 — a move aimed at avoiding an indication of the amount of   currency turned in. The central bank, however, promised to disclose the numbers in its annual report, which will be published in August.

 The June 30 disclosures are significant because the   closes its books for its accounting year on this date. Also, this was the last date for non-residents — who were not present in India during demonetisation — to turn in any Indian currency they had legally taken out of the country.
 
 According to the latest data released by the central bank, the total currency in circulation was Rs 15.17 lakh crore as on July 7, 2017. This is Rs 2.13 lakh crore less than the amount as on the same day last year. As on November 8, 2016, the total amount of currency in circulation was Rs 17.7 lakh crore.
 
 Last week, RBI governor   informed a parliamentary standing committee that the bank was still not in a position to provide the exact amount of demonetised currency returned to the central bank. He also said that the central bank has cut staff holidays to complete counting of currency notes and ordered more machines to expedite the process.
 
 The RBI discloses its asset-liability figures under its weekly statistical supplement. This   data is part of the information the central bank has committed to disclose as a signatory to the International Monetary Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standards ( ).
