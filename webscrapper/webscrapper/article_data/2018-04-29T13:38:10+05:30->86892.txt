BENGALURU: “Criminal”. That's the word Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Virat Kohli used to describe his team’s bowling show after they failed to defend 205 against Chennai Super Kings on Wednesday. The Kolkata Knight Riders bowlers too didn't cover themselves in glory when they conceded 219 runs against an embattled Delhi Daredevils on Friday. On Sunday, bowlers on both sides get a chance to redeem themselves in a crunch match.

 
 
 
 When the two sides meet at the M Chinnaswamy stadium, it will make for an intriguing contest of hard-hitting batsmen and quality spinners, many of whom are yet to come to the party.
 
 
 
 With two wins from six outings, the home side is precariously placed at the sixth position. If they want to keep their playoff hopes alive, they have to realise there is no margin for error from here on. Kolkata, on the other hand, are placed fourth, but if they don't pull themselves up, the slide is inevitable.
 
 Both sides have a lot of wrinkles to iron out in their game. Kohli for one will hope to convert the starts he has got at home so far. While AB de Villiers has been the go-to man and Quinton de Kock has been making healthy contributions, the rest - barring Mandeep Singh - of the RCB batsmen have done little justice to their place in the squad.
 
 Given the turn the Bengaluru strip has been offering, the ineffectiveness of Corey Anderson at the business end and the fact that their economy in the last six overs is above 13, Kohli could ring in the much-needed change among the overseas players. He can opt for Tim Southee or Moeen Ali, and use the services of New Zealand allrounder   as a bowler. The misfiring Pawan Negi too could find his place under threat. Yuzvendra Chahal and Umesh Yadav will continue to be the main bowlers for the hosts, and Kohli will be careful in how the team utilises their eight overs.
