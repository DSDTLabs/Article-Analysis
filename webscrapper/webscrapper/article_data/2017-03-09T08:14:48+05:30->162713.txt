CHENNAI: Why aren't women able to get absorbed into their industries after a sabbatical and how can this be changed? 

 This wasn't just a   but the seed of thought that brought two   Vandana Ramanathan, 29, and Jinal Patel, 25, together to  . 
 
 Vandana, a mother of two children, drew from her own experience while putting the initial sketches for 'Wsquare', the first coworking   in the country, as the duo describe it. 
 
 It was launched in   on Wednesday on the occasion of International Women's Day and new hubs will come up in other parts of the city soon. 
 
 The coworking area is a casual workspace for women from all walks of life, with special focus on pregnant woman and new mothers, who are unable to work from home or want to network. 
 
 With weekend workshops and on-call health and lifestyle services, the founders have filled the niche of a community working space designed specially for women. 
 
 "We wanted to build a space for women to work from, whether it is setting up their own company, working as a freelancer or even just ideating," explains Jinal, pointing to the recreational yoga room, workspace and lounge for startup ideators and professionals to network and brainstorm.
 
  Currently, women can take up daily, monthly or even 10-day passes to use the space. The two plan to expand the coworking hubs to other cities. A second centre is being launched in Mumbai next week.
