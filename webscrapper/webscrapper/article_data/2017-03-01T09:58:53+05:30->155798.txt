MAU: She readily allowed Qaumi Ekta Dal, led by don-turned-MLA  , to be merged with her party last month despite facing all-round flak. On Tuesday, BSP chief landed in   to campaign for the jailed mafia don who is the party’s canidate from the Sadar seat.

 Seeking vote for him,   said that his victory would erase his ‘bahubali’ image. “I urge you to vote in large numbers, thereby ensuring a comprehensive victory for Mukhtar Ansari. Once he wins the assembly polls, his ‘baahubali’ image will gradually diminish,” she said. Mau is going to the polls on March 4.
 
 Mayawati also accused SP and BJP of having double standards about such “strongmen” in politics. “Both the parties have soft corner for people like Raja Bhaiya. Former CM Kalyan Singh of BJP had described as kunda ka gunda. But, both these parties help Raja Bhaiya in elections,” she alleged. 
 
 Mukhtar, who faces 40 criminal cases, including those of murder and kidnapping, recently joined BSP after the merger of his QED with the SP couldn’t take place due to objections from chief minister  . Mayawati then allowed QED’s merger to consolidate its Muslim-Dalit combination in some constituencies of eastern districts where the Ansari brothers have their strong influence.
 
 BSP has fielded him from Mau, from where Mukhtar has been winning for the past four times. Besides, his son Abbas has been fielded from Ghosi and brother Sibgatullah from Mohmmadabad. Mukhtar was given custody parole by a trial court from February 16 to March 4 to let him campaign in the election. However, Delhi high court set aside the lower court order.
 
 Mukhtar has been in a jail since 2005 for his alleged role in the murder of BJP legislator Krishnanand Rai and his six supporters. Rai's widow had got the case transferred to Delhi from UP on grounds that Mukhtar could influence and intimidate witnesses, hampering a fair trial in the state.
