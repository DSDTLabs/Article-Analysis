NASHIK: Maintaining a good flow of communication between doctors and patients was the prime focus of the   (MUHS) budget for the 2017-18   that was presented on Friday. 

 Considering the current duress in the doctor-patient relationship, the MUHS has allotted funds of Rs 25 lakh to train budding doctors on good communication skills while handling patients and their relatives. “The university will organise special workshops and camps for students, as well as practising doctors, to better their communication skills. This will help boost doctor-patient relationship,” said vice-chancellor Dileep Mhaisekar. 
 
 The MUHS Senate passed its annual budget of Rs 377.37 crore for the 2017-18 academic year. The university will also focus on setting up a separate research department. 
 
 “We want to develop the university’s research potential. For this, a separate department for research will be established. Apart from Rs 3 crore for this , we have set aside Rs 1 crore for state-of-the-art research labs at all four MUHS divisional centres. Besides, Rs 25 lakh will be set aside for conducting national and international workshops and seminars, Rs 25 lakh for teachers’ training, Rs 25 lakh for expert lectures and Rs 50 lakh as special research encouragement funds,” Mhaisekar said. 
 
 According to the V-C, these are long-term investments and will yield good results in the next five years. The MUHS has also made special provisions for students willing to go to foreign universities for higher studies. Funds of Rs 3.05 crore were allotted for personality development, career counseling and communication skills-related projects.
