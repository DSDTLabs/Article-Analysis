KOCHI: Authorities anticipate a huge turnout of tourists as the city gets ready to host   but the infrastructure in   has taken a beating. The walkway constructed in the beach a few months ago and a large part of the beach was lost due to  . Piled-up waste in front of tourist attractions is also contributing to the eye sore. 

 According to office-bearers of  ,   authorities haven't taken any step for cleaning the beach. "Most part of the beach has been lost due to sea erosion last month. A walkway constructed in the beach was completely demolished in the high tide. While constructing the walkway, we had asked the corporation authorities to use the funds for extending the breakwater instead. Had the breakwater been extended, it could have checked the sea erosion," said Antony Kureethra, secretary, 
 
 Tourism Promoters Association, Kochi. Corporation officials said they will have to get various nods for renovating the walkway.
 
 "Waste remains piled up in front of Folklore Theatre, Fort Kochi bus stand, beach and boat jetty. The corporation authorities can use the fund allotted under Swachch Bharat for cleaning these areas," said Kureethra. He also alleged that the government failed to protect the Chinese nets despite the promises. "Now, almost all of the Chinese nets have been mechanized leading to loss of heritage value. Many of the heritage buildings in Kochi are being reconstructed without retaining the heritage aspects. Kochi will lose much of its heritage if this is not checked," he said.
