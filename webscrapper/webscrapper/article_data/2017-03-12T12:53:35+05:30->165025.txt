 I am a 38-year-old married woman with a child. I met a man on   about a year ago. Now, I guess Iâ€™m in love with him.
 
  I had an arranged marriage and have no issues with my husband. He is very loving and caring. But what I feel for the man I met on Facebook is completely different. I have never felt the same for my husband. I go mad if he doesn't talk to me even for a single day.
  
  I have just kissed him once 3 months back. But, I can still feel the magic of that moment, which I never experienced with my husband of almost 18 years. I was brought up in a conservative family, where I never used to hang out with men or had an   or anything else before marriage.
  
  I am just going through the chat history and reliving all the moments. I feel he has opened a new side of me, which I never knew I had. At the same time, I don't want to hurt my husband or disturb the family. I cannot leave him for my selfishness, but I can't control my feelings for this guy also. I' m in a confused state of mind. Please guide me. -
 
  
  
 I really don't mean to break your heart, but dear- grass is always greener on the other side. This is the most common phenomenon I handle in my practice, where I see people falling for men or   on social media. The picture or the nature shown there by people is completely away from reality, and hence we find people very mushy and rosy, matching the world of our fantasy. Your co-dependency on this man you met on Facebook is my point of worry. I suggest you to please work on your marriage and try and cement your bond with your husband. The reason you got attracted to this man is due to lack of exposure, where dating was concerned. Boredom can be also a strong reason. Let go of the relationship outside your marriage for a healthy and positive life.
