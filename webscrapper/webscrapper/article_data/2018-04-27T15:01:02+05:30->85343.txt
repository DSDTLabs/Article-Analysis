NAGPUR: Following a call from the Association of   Medical Interns (ASMI), the interns at the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) and the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) staged demonstrations and held protest march in the colleges against the government. The protest is against the   monthly   being paid to them in comparison to the amount of stipend paid to the interns in other state.

 The interns have asked the state government to fulfil their demands till May 3, 2018 otherwise the strike will be continued. ASMI is demanding a stipend of at least Rs 20,000 monthly.
 
 The interns serve the patients in rural sector for one year after passing their MBBS. There are about 4,000 interns in state. They say that they are getting just Rs 6000 per as their monthly stipend whereas this amount in other states is much higher.
 
 “We were promised a rise up to Rs 11,000 by Dr  , chief, directorate of medical education and research in 2011. But all these years we have been receiving only Rs 6000 stipend. We have only been getting assurances and no rise in the amount has been seen. Though the qualifying examination across India is same, the stipend varies from state to state,” said Dr Shubham Borekar, joint secretary, ASMI, GMCH.
 
 Dr  , joint secretary ASMI, IGGMC said that there are no fixed working hours for the interns and there is tremendous mental stress during the work. In addition to that, government is imposing the rule of compulsory medical officership before appearing for the NEET post graduate examination. The interns are left with no option but to continue with the low stipend.
