JAISALMER:   whose land was used in fencing at the border adjoining Pakistan are still awaiting compensation.

 
  colonel   had recently raised this issue in   demanding compensation for 11,465 bighas of land belonging to 1,959 farmers in 55 villages.
 
 The MP said that a court on January 28, 2013, had ordered the Centre and state governments while remarking that farmers should be given the right to do agriculture work on their ancestral land. 
 
 The MP said that farmers of J&K, Punjab, Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh in Rajasthan talked to officers of revenue department and defence ministry and got the gates opened at each 1-2 km for farming, whereas farmers of Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Barmer districts, due to lack of awareness and illiteracy, did not get the gates opened during fencing. As a result, in these three districts, 1,959 farmers of 55 villages are not able to do farming on 11,465 bighas of ancestral land.
 
 The MP demanded that 100 metres of land has come between Indo-Pak border fencing and zero point, but farmers have got right for only 6 feet strip, so compensation should be given for the land that has come in fencing. The farmers demand that they should be given land in nearby villages and compensation as per the market price for the remaining land.
