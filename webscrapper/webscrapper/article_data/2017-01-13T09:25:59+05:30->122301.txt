KOLKATA: Reeling under acute  , the   on Thursday said this was leading to overburdening of work and rising pendencies. 

 The sanctioned strength of Calcutta HC is 72 and it has only 39 judges at present, which works out to a vacancy of nearly 46%. The approved strength of the country's 24 high courts is 1,079, of which 464 posts or 43% are vacant.
 
 During the hearing of a case   said: “In the last few years no appointment of judges were made in the High Court and for that we, who are the sitting judges are overburdened with work.” “We the judges”, Justice Somadder said, “are not getting proper facilities. We do not have any personal secretaries of our own... Chief secretaries or cabinet secretaries are getting much more facilities than us.”
 
 He further said: “If we want something for improvement of work, finance department says there are difficulties to provide money for that. A portion of the High Court’s corridor is collapsing but the renovation work hasn’t begun yet. Like this, one day may be the judiciary which is one of the pillar of the democracy can collapse any time.”
 
 Even as Calcutta HC tries to offset disposals against fresh cases on a month-on-month basis, the pendency had prompted former Chief Justice Girish Chandra Gupta to write to former Chief Justice of India T S Thakur seeking appointment of three HC ex-judges and a sitting judge to reduce this backlog. The last HC appointment was of Justice   on October 6.
