Sankara tells everyone that pandit ji has come up with tomorrow's date for Bihaan and her wedding. She tells Tina that now soon she will be her mother.
 
  Sankara asks Bihaan if he is happy. Bihaan tells her that he is happy if her daughter is happy. Thapki starts crying. Shraddha threatens her that Bihaan will soon go away from her forever and she should get ready to leave.
  
  Shraddha takes Sankara out for bridal shopping. A buffalo starts running behind Sankaran. Buffalo's owner tells them that it got crazy seeing red color.
  
  Shraddha asks Sankara to hide their buffalo Gulabo inside. She then asks the buffalo owner she met in the market to come home.
  
  Thapki gets ready as a bride to make Bihaan remember the past. Thapki then gets a message from Bihaan to come out. She goes out and as soon as the buffalo sees her, he breaks the rope and runs towards her. Thapki runs inside the house holding Tina's hands. Tina falls down. Everyone panics.
