JAIPUR: A team of   (ACB) carried out searches at the offices and warehouses of   dairy on Saturday after it received a complaint that milk products were being illegally sold in the market with an alleged connivance of dairy officials and private distributors. 

 ACB officials told TOI that currently the dairy has authorised the sell and distribution of only May batch’s  , but a few days ago the packets of November batch were found at a few shops. 
 
 “The batch products are sold in the market in order to maintain the stock and the quality, until one batch is completely sold out, the dairy doesn’t introduce new batch in the market. In this case, the milk powder of May batch were not cleared and Saras had not authorised the distribution of November batch of milk powder,” the official told TOI.
 
 Seeing ACB inspector   and his team, senior officials of the dairy left from the office to avoid scrutiny. The ACB took several papers into its custody and quizzed dairy officials.
 
 The ACB also sent its teams to carry out searches at the warehouse in Bagru which Saras have taken on rent to store milk products. “Upon investigation, we found that owner of these warehouses, also happens to be one of the distributor of Saras products. This raises the question if milk products from here were sold in the market,” a senior ACB official told TOI. 
 
 “We are investigating the case. We have collected several papers which we are investigating to know how the November batch’s products were sold in the market,” Singh said.
 
 He added that ACB is carrying out the verification of warehouses of the Saras. “A particular batch number of a dairy product is released in the market after complete verification of its quality,” an official told TOI.
