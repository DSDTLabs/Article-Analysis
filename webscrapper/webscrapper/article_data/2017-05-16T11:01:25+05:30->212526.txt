LUCKNOW: Irked over SP MLAs' behaviour who threw paper balls at the governor in the   on Monday, chief minister   is planning to impose   before they enter the House. Chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi has taken a strong note of the gross misbehaviour by the agitating   who were hurling paper bombs and missiles at the Governor   during his speech on the opening day of the first session of the UP Assembly. 

 The CM strongly disapproved of the paper attacks, and display of placards and banners to him and the governor by the opposition MLAs in the House. 
 
 Yogi is learnt to have enquired from the government and assembly officials how to impose a ban on brining placards and banners to the assembly. He also asked if MLAs can be frisked. At present, MLAs only have to pass through the metal detectors to ensure they are not carrying any firearm or sharp-edged metallic article like knife, but they are not frisked. Yogi might initiate some measures after having consultations with Speaker Hriday Narain Dixit.
