VIJAYAWADA: A fresh controversy has erupted over the   (SIT) that was constituted to reinvestigate the   murder case. Ayesha's parents have opposed the inclusion of   in the SIT. Saherunnisa, presently working as the Machavaram circle inspector, has been involved in the investigation process of the case from day one.

 P Srinivas, advocate who represented P Satyam Babu in Vijayawada session’s court, also said he has reservations over Saherunnisa in SIT.
