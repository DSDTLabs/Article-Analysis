VADODARA: Professor   of the sculpture department of M S University’s Faculty of Fine Arts had to face some thorough grilling as a three-member fact-finding committee constituted by the university began its probe against him on Monday. 

 Ahmed has been accused of selling off sculptures of master artists to a city-based gallery owner without their knowledge. 
 
 The issue was raised by veteran artist and former dean of the faculty   who had written mails last week stating that Ahmed had sold off his sculpture to gallery owner Hitesh Rana without his knowledge. 
 
 The sculptures which Ahmed sold to Rana were made by veteran artists Mistry,   and late Mahendra Pandya for which Rana has already paid Rs five lakh. 
 
 After the controversy, Rana has announced that he will surrender the disputed sculptures to the faculty. 
 
 On Monday, when the committee called Ahmed to record his statement he kept beating around the bush, said a source in the probe committee. 
 
 “He first claimed that the sculpture was given to him by a senior friend way back in late 1980s. When we asked him about the name of the senior friend, he said there were couple of them and he will have to recollect the names which is surprising,” a committee member told TOI. 
 
 Mistry who also recorded his complaint before the committee reiterated that he had left the sculpture at the department while leaving the faculty in 2002. 
 
 The sculpture was last seen at the faculty at the time of VadFest which was held in 2015. 
 
 “We will now call senior artist Jyoti Bhatt and gallery owner Hitesh Rana to record their statements,” said syndicate member  , who is heading the probe committee which has arts faculty dean professor P S Choondawat, fine arts dean professor Sunjay Jain as members and Mayank Vyas as member secretary.
