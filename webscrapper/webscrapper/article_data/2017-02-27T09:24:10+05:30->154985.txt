JAIPUR: The principal of model government school at   in Baran district was put on ‘awaiting posting orders’ for turning down the request of RSS members to hold a function in the school on Sunday. 

 Angry over the incident, students of the school staged a demonstration in the village on Saturday.
 
 “The letter I have received only mentions administrative reasons for placing me on APO. I was informed that RSS wanted to use the premises. There are members of all communities in the school, and the school management committee was of the opinion that such a function could not be allowed in the premises. I also had no orders from my superiors to allow use of the school for such a function. I went by the rule book, which does not allow the use of a school for such events,” principal   told TOI.
 
 Mubarak Ali, a member of the school development and management committee, and other villagers and members of the panchayat also joined the students in their protest. The students said their principal had been doing a good job and deserved to be rewarded for it, not punished. 
 
 Baran education officer   could not be reached on phone for comments in the matter.
