AHMEDABAD: Popular culture has romanticized the shooting star as the omen of the perfect time to wish for a boon. But what if one’s wish is to find these  ?

 Narendra Bhandari, a professor with the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL),   — who has also worked with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR),  ,  ,   — has spent considerable time of his five-decade career collecting and analyzing meteorites.
 
  The Gujarat Science Academy has recently published Bhandari’s book “Falling Stones and Secrets of the Universe” in which he deciphers the celestial phenomenon and what the analysis of meteorites can reveal about the cosmos. In general parlance, meteorites can be described as the remainder of a meteor — a piece of rock or metal from outer space that survives the passage through Earth’s atmosphere and impact with the surface. So far, scientists have found about 30,000 meteorites on Earth tracing their origin to Moon and Mars, and asteroids from the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
 
 “It is astonishing what these stones can tell — they are among the earliest products of our solar system,” Bhandari said. “They have in them well-preserved records, not only from the beginning of the solar system but also of the universe. Their composition gives us a peek into the origin of elements, primordial and stellar nucleosynthesis and the impact of cosmic rays.”
 
  
  
 Bhandari researched over 15 meteorites from Gujarat and Rajasthan soon after they had entered Earth. In all, he has worked on nearly a thousand meteorites found from across the globe including in the US and Italy. “Gujarat and Rajasthan have large arid regions where meteorites can be found with ease,” he said. “People play a major role in identifying and reporting meteorites. In one instance, a schoolgirl prevented her father from throwing a stone after it was found in a pit. It turned out to be a meteorite.”
 
 
 
 **The evolution of life on Earth is closely associated with celestial stones. A popular theory suggests that the seeds of life on Earth came in the form of amino acids from outer space through meteorites. 
 
 **A mega meteorite ended the reign of dinosaurs on Earth 65 million years ago. Evidence of the phenomenon can be found in cosmic dust — dark or reddish in colour — deposited between Cretaceous and Teritary shales, the depth at which fossils of dinosaurs are found. The dust is rich in iridium and other elements which are found in high concentration in meteorites.
 
 **Lonar Lake in Maharashtra is actually a 1.8km crater formed 46,000 years ago by the impact of an object with 100-metre diameter.
 
 **Rare Earth metals, widely used in products such as smart phones and solar panels, arrived on Earth through millennia of meteorite impacts. 
 
 **Billions of micro-sized bodies rain on Earth at a high speed, resulting in nearly a hundred tonnes of material in the form of fine dust falling on Earth on a daily basis. Round the year, Earth passes through specific areas with large concentration of space debris which result in ‘meteor showers.’ Some of the well-known showers include Leonids in mid-November and Orionids in early December.
 
 
 
 The year was 1976 and the place was Dhajala in Surendrangar district where a school assembly saw a bright fireball in the sky. A hissing sound streaked across the horizon. An ‘ulka’ had indeed fallen and scientists from Ahmedabad led by Bhandari reached at the spot on the second day. The team camped in the village for months and managed to find about 500 fragments, the largest weighing 12kg. The meteoroid, considered to be originating from the asteroid belt, is suspected to have initial weight of 20,000kg of which only 75kg survived upon impact. Volunteers who collected fragments were mostly local school students. 
 
 
 
 
 Is there a chance of you stumbling on a celestial rock? The chance cannot be ruled out. Experts say that meteorites look very distinctive — they have uneven surface and show signs of burning or melting due to atmospheric friction. They are heavier than normal stones. Most of the meteorites are attracted to magnets and also reveal small fragments or chondrules upon using the file on their surface.
