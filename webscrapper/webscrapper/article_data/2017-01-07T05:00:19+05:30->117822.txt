MUMBAI: Hoping to garner Dalit votes, the   government on Friday paved way for the construction of Dr  , just before the code of conduct for civic polls sets in.

 The state urban development department has issued a notification saying that the 2.03 hectare land, out of the 4.84 hectare at   in   (W), is deleted from the ‘special industrial zone (I-3)” and included in the surrounding residential zone and reserved for a “grand memorial of Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb   Memorial”. 
 
 Prime minister   had laid the foundation stone of the memorial in 2015, however, nothing has moved since then.
