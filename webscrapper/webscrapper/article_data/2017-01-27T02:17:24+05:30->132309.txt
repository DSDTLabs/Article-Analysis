NEW DELHI: Police have arrested a 24-year-old youth after he killed a 35-year-old man in southwest Delhi’s Dabri late on Saturday night. The man had fired two rounds at the victim and then attacked him on his head with a sword. Police said that the accused was wanted in several cases of attempt to murder, robbery and gambling. 

 The accused, identified as Nawab Khan, was arrested in connection with the murder at a JJ Colony in Bindapur, Dabri on January 21. Police said that Khan was apprehended from near Bhalswa Dairy flyover at the outer ring road on the day of the murder. 
 
 The accused told police that due to an ongoing gambling rivalry, he and his friends planned to kill the victim. 
 
 According to police, Khan — previously involved in several cases of robbery, attempt to murder, Arms Act, Gambling Act, etc — was involved in a gambling racket and was at war with Raju, the victim, who too was involved in the same criminal activity. They both had a criminal record. 
 
 Due to the running feud between them, Raju had attacked Khan on two occasions. To avenge the same, Khan had planned to kill Raju as the latter and his associates were repeatedly threatening him.
 
 “Raju arrived at the spot and threatened them again, resulting in his revenge murder using sword and pistol by Khan and associates, who fled the scene afterwards,” a police official said.
