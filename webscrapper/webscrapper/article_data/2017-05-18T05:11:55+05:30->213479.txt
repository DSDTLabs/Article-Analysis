NEW DELHI: Sacked   minister   on Wednesday lodged a   with Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) against chief minister Arvind   for financial irregularities. Mishra purportedly submitted evidence of AAP’s “fake balance sheet” among other evidence of “misappropriation of funds” and funding to the party through shell companies using black money.

 “I have submitted to CBDT the fake balance sheet that has Kejriwal’s signature. The evidences would expose him further,” Mishra told reporters after coming out of the CBDT office. Most of the evidences against Kejriwal were the same ones submitted to CBI.
 
 Earlier, Mishra had claimed in a blog that Kejriwal has been to office just twice in the past one year. “Kejriwal works the least among all CMs in the country. He has gone to office just two times in the past one year,” he said. He claimed that soon Kejriwal will become the CM facing probe in the largest number of corruption cases.
 
 “Even as the houses of his friends and relatives are being raided, even as more and more corruption is coming to light, Kejriwal leaves his house after many days to watch Sarkar 3. That’s right, Sarkar 3,” Mishra said on Twitter.
 
 Meanwhile, the AAP MLA from Burari, Sanjeev Jha, who had gone on indefinite fast against Mishra’s hunger strike, broke his fast on Wednesday. He went on fast seeking evidence from Mishra to back his allegation that Kejriwal took Rs 2 crore from cabinet minister Satyendar Jain. “It is now clear that Mishra’s allegation were false,” Jha said.
