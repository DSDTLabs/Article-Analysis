GAYA: Amidst growing demand for speedy   of the culprit who abducted and allegedly killed the eight-year-old girl after rape, Magadh division commissioner Jitendra Srivastav on Thursday said the culprit, now in custody, would be put on speedy trial. 

 In a similar case, in which a Japanese tourist was raped in April 2010, justice was delivered within record 30 days during which everything including registration of the case, investigation, submission of chargesheet, charge framing, deposition and cross examination of the witnesses and final argument by the two sides was completed. Three of the five accused were awarded life imprisonment in the much-publicised case. 
 
 “In Tuesday’s case, the accused Chhotu, who is in his late 20s and has a criminal record, deserves capital punishment for this rape and murder,” said   lawyer Aziz Ahmad Muneri. The case falls in the rarest of rare category, said the lawyer.
 
 According to SSP Garima Malik, she is yet to receive the postmortem report. The postmortem was conducted by a four-member medical board in the forensic science department of Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College (ANNMCH) and the report is likely to come on Friday. 
 
 “Forensic experts have examined the place of occurrence and collected evidence. DSP (city) Alok Kumar has been made the case investigating officer (IO),” said the SSP.
 
 Though officials are reluctant to share postmortem information, sources say that rape has been confirmed. Zonal IG Naiyyar Hasnain Khan told TOI on Thursday that he has directed the Gaya police to submit a chargesheet within a week. “Laxity in investigation will not be tolerated,” said Khan.
 
 Meanwhile, heavy police deployment has been made in Gewalbigha locality of the town, the scene of violent protests and arson on Wednesday.
