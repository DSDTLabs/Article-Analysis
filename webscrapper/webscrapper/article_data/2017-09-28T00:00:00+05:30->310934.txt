Yaamirukka Bayamey fame   will be introducing actor Saikumar’s son Aadi   in Tamil with  , which, he says, is an adventure film. “This is not a horror film, though there is a horror element in it. It is an adventure film that begins in the city and moves to a fantasy version of a village. We have all heard grandma’s stories, which will always have a mix of everything — scares, thrills and also excitement, as they will mostly be adventure stories. This is one such film,” says Deekay.

 He adds that the film will have period portions as well. “The film goes back and forth between the past and present, and this story takes place in the modern times and in the 1960s,” he informs. On casting Aadi, he says, “Aadi has acted in a few Telugu films. In fact, he is doing the Telugu remake of Yaamirukka Bayamey. He is handsome and suits the role of my hero.” While   has been roped in for the female lead, Deekay reveals that Kaatteri will, in fact, have four heroines! “We are currently in the pre-production stage and it will take us two months to go on floors. We will be selecting the other female leads in the coming days,” he says.
