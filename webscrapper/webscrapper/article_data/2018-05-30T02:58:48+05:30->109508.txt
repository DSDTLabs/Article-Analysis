MUMBAI: Almost a year after former Doordarshan anchor   was killed after a portion of coconut tree fell on her in   during rains, the police are on the verge of closing the case as an accident. 

 Pictures of the tree was sent to the agriculture university in   for analysis. The university's expert team that studied the pictures recently sent its findings. "The report says that the tree was fine from the outside, but had become hollow in the middle of the truck, so due to winds it cracked and fell, " said an official of Chembur police. 
 
 Kanchan's husband   reacted strongly when he was informed about the report. 
 
 "I am not aware of the findings, but I feel that one department is trying to cover up the mistakes of another. They admitted the tree had become hollow, but are not directly admitting the tree had got infected though it was brought to the  's notice that it was infected," he said.
