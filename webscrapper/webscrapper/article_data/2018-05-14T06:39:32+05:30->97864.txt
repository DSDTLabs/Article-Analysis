BENGALURU: Residents of Bellandur were in for a rude shock on Thursday morning to see 24 trees were chopped down in their area. They suspect the trees in the median over a stretch of 500 metres near the skywalk on   were felled by miscreantsto givebetter visibility to advertisement hoardings nearby. This is said to be the fourth such incident in the recent past.

 
 Three varieties of trees – Tabebuia, Pongamia oiltree and Pride of India— were felled. In a desperate bid to save stumps and salvage the chopped portions of the trees, residents along withenvironmentalist andtreedoctor Vijay Nishanth applied fungicide to them on Sunday .
 
 “By applying fungicide on stumps as well as the bark, we can prevent infection on trees. They can grow again without any infection as they have good growth capacity,” said Vijay.
 
 Residents said tree chopping is due to the hoarding menace on either side of the road, similar to what happened in Marathahalli last month where 10 trees were cut. “These trees have been cut by private organizations to improve visibility of their hoardings. This hasbeen happening for sometime now and based on our complaints to the Lokayukta, three FIRs have been filed. There is an order which makes it illegal tocuttreesfor the purposeof better visibility. The licences of these organizations must be cancelled and their hoardings must be brought down immediately,” said Vijay, adding that a complaint willbe registered on Monday.
 
 OdetteKatrak, a resident,said: “All these trees have been cut overnight when most of the cops in the area were busy with elections.”
