MUMBAI: Shiv Sena chief   is caught in a dilemma over party  's assault on an   in New Delhi on Wednesday.

 "Shiv Sainiks, who are steeped in the Sena's culture of street violence, will be upset if Uddhavji suspends Gaikwad from the party or asks him to resign his Lok Sabha seat, or both," said a senior party functionary on Friday. "On the other hand, the diehards will feel elated if Thackeray leaves Gaikwad unpunished. But that would send wrong signals across the nation."
 
 Political analysts said hawks in the Sena have gained an upper hand since Thackeray adopted a tough stance vis-a-vis the BJP during the BMC elections. The sentiment has carried through in the party's pro-active role in bringing the assembly to a halt over a loan waiver for farmers.
 
 But judging from Thackeray's stance of seeking an explanation from his MP, Matoshree seems eager to send a clear message to Sainiks, who can't think beyond strong-arm tactics, to mend their ways. The Sena president has instructed Anil Desai, party secretary and RS MP, to seek details of the incident from Gaikwad. "After Desai briefs Uddhavji, Gaikwad will be summoned by Matoshree," said the party functionary. There is no move so far to ask Gaikwad to quit the party or as MP, it is learnt.
 
 "The incident has poured cold water on Uddhavji's attempts over the last few years to project the Sena as mainstream political organisation which believes in democratic traditions," the partyman added. Thackeray also held talks with Anandrao Adsul, the Sena veteran in the Lok Sabha, it is learnt.
 
 Sena ministers Eknath Shinde and Ramdas Kadam have said there was no need for the party's Osmanabad MP to resort to violence. This is in sharp contrast to the Sena of yore when Sainiks would unitedly back, even lionize, a party colleague who indulged in street violence, said observers. The two, however, were quick to add that Gaikwad ought to have been treated with "respect" as he is an elected representative.
