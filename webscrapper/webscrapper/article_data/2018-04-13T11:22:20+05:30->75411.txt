CHARMINAR: As the swanky   ( ) gets ready to chug out in  , women commuters from different walks of life, especially those from the office and college-going crowd, are eagerly awaiting to check if the new project will ensure them that much-needed space, safety and comfort.

 While HMR has ensured denizens that women play a major driving force behind the city’s dream project, women commuters say that they have been looking forward to a transport system that will help them commute to their work places located in the new city more comfortably.
 
 “It is has been very difficult to even commute in share autos or spend money for share cabs or carpools on a daily basis. And buses are always crowded. We hope that the metro will solve these problems,” she said.
 
 While some women are expecting the Metro to be safer than other means of transport in Old City, some look at it as a relief from the horrendous traffic jams.
 
 “Traffic is the biggest problem in Old City. It is a humongous task to find a way out of these narrow roads almost every day. I am hoping the new Metro will offer a reprieve from our daily commuting woes. What takes you one hour by road should take just 15 to 20 minutes by Metro,”   Rashid, a software employee said.
 
 The Metro will be a boon to all those women who struggle to catch the bus or a share auto.
 
 “I heard there is going to be a train every few minutes and that is exactly what we need. If the   are frequent, you are technically never going to miss a train,” Bushra added.
