GUWAHATI: The Centre on Wednesday conveyed to   chief minister Sarbananda   that it would soon set up a committee to implement a key clause of the Assam Accord of 1985 which has remained on the back burner for the past 33 years. 

 
 The clause provides for constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the indigenous communities of Assam. “The home minister promised that a committee will be set up at the earliest, in consultation with the state government, for implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord,” Sonowal said after his meeting with   minister   in New Delhi on Wednesday. 
 
 The chief minister’s office said Sonowal had requested Singh to consider doing so. Clause 6 of the accord states that “constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards, as may be appropriate, shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people”.
