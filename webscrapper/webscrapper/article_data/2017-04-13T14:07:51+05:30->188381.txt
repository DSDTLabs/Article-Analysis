Ratnavali calls   forward along with wife Anjali. He hesitates to come and tells her that   should go first. When Jetha doesn't agree, Taarak goes up and is surprised to see the locket has gone missing from his chain. Everyone is taken aback by shock. Anjali is suspicious about him keeping it somewhere purposely, but Taarak refuses.
 
  Taarak tries to remember where he'd drop the locket, but finds out that it was stuck. Taark is tensed as Ratnavali sprays the liquid on it. He is happy to see that the stone changed colour to red and now black. Ratnavali explains it to everyone that Taarak's love for Anjali was always evergreen and will also be in the future. Anjali and Taarak share a romantic moment and everyone starts clapping.
  
  Up next is Bhide and his wife Madhuri. Bhide has questions, which he wants to ask from Ratnavali, but Madhuri get suspicious of him when he asks too much about the stone and the spray that is used.
  
  As Ratnavali sprays on the stone, it turns yellow, which means that Bhide loves his wife a lot, but at times is unable to express it to his wife and his love is old school.
  
  Then comes Sodhi and wife Roshan. Meanwhile, Jethalal is tensed about his stone turning black.
  
  
 
  
  When everyone awaits the result of Sodhi's stone, they are shocked to see the stone break as soon as the liquid is sprayed on it. Everyone starts questioning Sodhi and he stands there speechless.
  
  Ratnavali tells everyone that it is a good sign that the stone broke. Sodhi shouts in excitement. She tells them that the stone could not bear the intensity of love Sodhi has for his wife Roshan. Everyone is happy but Jethalal is tensed as it is his turn now.
