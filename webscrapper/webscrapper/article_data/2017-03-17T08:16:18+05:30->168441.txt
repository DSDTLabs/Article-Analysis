 Responding to the court's earlier query regarding the status of the proceeding before lokayukta in the same matter, prosecution informed that pendency of the case before lokayukta is not a bar for VACB to proceed as Prevention of Corruption Act is a central legislation whereas the statute under which lokayukta is formed is a state legislation. They also presented a letter sent by the registrar of lokayukta allegedly stating that pendency of proceedings before it is not a bar for VACB to proceed with the investigation.
 
 Defending VACB's action, prosecution has submitted that its proceedings were based on a CAG report. A quick verification was conducted and the FIR was registered on the basis of the findings in the preliminary enquiry, the court was told with the aid of documental evidence.
 
 Questioning VACB's decision to register an FIR, the former chief secretary has contended that chances of conviction is remote even if prosecution in the case is permitted to continue. Pointing out that he had an unblemished career for 35 years, he has claimed that he is innocent of the allegations levelled against him in the FIR.
