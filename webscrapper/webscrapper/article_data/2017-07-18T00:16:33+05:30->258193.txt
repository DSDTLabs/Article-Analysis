Pune: After  ,   have stopped the   for the  . 

 Contractors, who have moved machinery and manpower for the project, want   and these 'idle charges' will make the project costlier by at least Rs 25 crore. The more the delay, the more public money will be wasted. 
 
 Sources said the process to move the machinery will start in a day or two. Workers, who are stationed on this site, will be asked to leave. “The   are asking to remove their machinery. They claim that it has become difficult to carry out work. They have demanded to remove the machines and manpower. We are planning to approve it,” Pravin Gedam, coordinator of the project for PMC, said.
 
 Shiv Sena leaders have been supporting the villagers’ demand for a compensation package. They claim they will not allow the project to move forward otherwise. BJP leaders from these parts are voicing the same concerns.
 
 “Very few people received compensation. Farmers have lost confidence in the authorities. Though we are BJP workers and leaders, we have come here in our personal capacities. We want to keep the agitation beyond party lines,” Atul Deshmukh, president of BJP’s Khed taluka and a project-affected farmer, said.
 
 “The problem can be solved if a nodal officer is appointed. The authorities should take up the issue seriously. But they are not doing so. Farmers have not got compensation,” Sharad Butte-Patil, Zilla Parishad member from the area, said.
 
 “Our land has been taken up for this project, but we are in the dark about our future. We are not aware of where we are going get the compensatory land. So we have started the agitation,” Satyavan Naval, a BJP Youth wing leader, said.
 
 Suresh Gore, Shiv Sena MLA of Khed constituency said the issue is being discussed with all the stakeholders. “We hope to start the works soon. A camp was organised to deal with the issues raised by the farmers,” he added.
