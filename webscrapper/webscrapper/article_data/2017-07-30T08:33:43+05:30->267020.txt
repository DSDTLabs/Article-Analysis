For the first time in almost eight years,   has stepped back inside an akhada in Old Delhi. During his initial   days, Sangram would train at different akhadas in the city, including the Delhi Police akhada in north Delhi. Now, as he gets ready to play wrestler   in his biopic, Sangram has decided to give modern workout methods a miss and returned to the akhada and desi training to lose weight. The wrestler has lost around 6kg in the last few months, and plans to lose another 10kg by November. 

  "I exercise each day for three hours. I don't get to visit the akhada every day since I keep travelling, but my training schedule incorporates the exercises that I used to do in the akhada. The only difference is that now my training is of a higher level than what I did earlier. It is an advanced version of cross-fit training, to explain in layman's term. It is not something I would have done 8-10 years ago," says Sangram.
 
  
  
 
  Explaining his workout schedule in detail, he says, "I get up at 6am after sleeping for six hours, as I feel that is the ideal time that my body needs. I start my workout at 7 in the morning, with 10-15 minutes of warming up. Not many know that digging the akhada pit with spade is the best warm-up exercise. For next 25-20 minutes, I just jump. I follow that up with bar exercises, that include 20 sets of pull-ups and chin-ups and extreme bar exercises like rock climbers do. I also do chakrasan, where you have to keep your head on the ground and create a curve with your body."
 
  He adds, "I also have taken inspiration from  's workout schedule, and do decline bench sit-ups, which are very good for reducing fat around your belly. I rely little on weight training. I have a different workout schedule for all days of the week. Three days a week I do wrestling, as thatâ€™s the best workout for the whole body."
