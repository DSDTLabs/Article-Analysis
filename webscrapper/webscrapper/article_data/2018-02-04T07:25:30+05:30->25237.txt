Chandernagore: The Indian colts thrashing Australia by eight wickets to clinch their fourth U-19 World Cup trophy on Saturday brought double delight to Chandernagore.

 Reason: local boy Ishan  . The lanky fast-medium bowler and a son of the suburban town, around 50km north of Kolkata, had bagged two crucial wickets making the victory possible.
 
 
 Ishan had raised expectations by claiming four wickets in the semi-final against Pakistan. In the final, he didn’t disappoint. With figures of 7-1-30-2, he proved the selectors right.
 
 Moments after Manjot Kalra hit the winning runs, Ishan’s father Chandranath Porel said, “This is the best day of our lives. Words can’t express how happy I am.”
 
 
  
 Fans and the Porel family took to   — where they live — with fireworks and banners carrying Ishan’s pictures. They watched the final on a giant TV screen that had been put up on the road, as the crowd chanted, “India....India...Ishan...Ishan....”
 
 Ishan’s mother   struggled to hold back tears every time she saw him on TV screen.
 
 “I am so proud of my son. We shall give him a grand welcome. Ishan’s hard work has finally paid off,” she said as tears rolled down her cheek.
 
 This World Cup has not been easy for Ishan. He injured his foot in the first match against Australia and missed the next three matches. Just when everyone feared that he might not have any further role to play in the competition,   made a strong comeback in the semi-final against Pakistan.
 
 Bibhash Das, Ishan’s coach, said, “The biggest challenge for us has been to keep him physically fit. We will do our best. Porel should target World Cup 2019 now.”
 
 “He was consistently clocking 138kph. His forte has been speed and bounce. He’s not a swing bowler per se, but he has the ability to generate off the seam movement and more bounce,” said Das.
 
 Porel grew up in a family with strong roots in sports.
 
 Ishan’s father feels his son has it in him to earn a place in the India senior side.
