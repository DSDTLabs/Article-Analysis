MANGALURU: BJP national president  , while speaking to TOI, said   that he is known to carry out to win polls for his party in other states is not required in Karnataka. He said this is because there is anger against the state government across all sections of society, and the caste of candidates has hence become irrelevant. Yet on Tuesday, during his visit to the coastal city for a series of road shows, Shah indulged in a bit of local social engineering of his own.

 This he did with a visit to the Sri Kshetra Gokarnanatha, the epicentre of the Billava community, that also houses a shrine dedicated to social reformer saint Sri Narayana Guru. What makes this more interesting is the fact that the temple is managed by former KPCC president B Janardhan Poojary, an eminent leader of the Billava community. But during election time, all is fair game, and Shah literally made an unscheduled pit stop to this temple before heading straight to the airport.
 
 Received by the temple trustee H S Sairam, Shah paid obeisance to Lord Mahaganapathy, Goddess Durga, and the navagrahas, before praying to Lord Gokarnanatha, the presiding deity. Sairam offered a shawl to Shah and also wished him all the best. He then also prayed to Brahmashree Narayanaguru where a woman priest performed arati. Shah’s personal assistant was on hand to provide him with currency that he placed in the arati plate after the puja.
 
 A beaming Shah exchanged pleasantries with the people and accepted salutations from the Gujarati community who wished him ‘Jai Sri Krishna’, a traditional Gujarati greeting. Mahendra Singh, UP minister for rural development, medical and health, Nalin Kumar Kateel, Daskhina Kannada MP, Uday Kumar Shetty, Mangaluru zonal in-charge of the party, K Monappa Bhandary, former MLC and other senior leaders of the party were present during the visit.
