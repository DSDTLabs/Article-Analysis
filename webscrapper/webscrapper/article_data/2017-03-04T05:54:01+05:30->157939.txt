HYDERABAD: Meteorologists may have forecast sunny weather near the   on March 4, but the mood will be sombre. Indian-Americans, deeply grieved over racist attacks against the community, will converge at the White House in Washington DC for a candlelight   and express solidarity with the victims of the   in Kansas. 

 Engineer   of Hyderabad was shot dead and his colleague at Garmin, Alok Madasani, was injured when a man opened fire at them at Austinâ€™s Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas on Feb 22. Another man, Ian Grillot, was injured when he attempted to save the duo from the alleged culprit Adam Purinton.
 
 Following the shooting, candlelight vigils and a peach march was held in Olathe while an online petition is gaining ground to elicit a response from the White House. The latest vigil, right in front of the seat of power, is being held to show that the Indian American community stands together against hate crimes, Islamophobia and xenophobia.
 
 The hosts of the candlelight vigil, Pooja Pandey, Sayed Naved and Shruti Bhatnagar, said that they have already obtained the necessary permission and security clearance for the event.
 
 The organisers recounted how on December 21, 2016, an Indian American woman from Harford County, 47-year-old Aravinda Pillalamarri, who is a US citizen who has lived in Bel Air for more than 30 years, was detained by the local law enforcement and questioned about her immigration status. Several such narratives have been rising of late, they said.
 
 Participants in the vigil have been asked to bring battery-operated candles in keeping with the regulations of the permit for the event. They can also bring flowers if they so wish. The collaborators for the event are Aligarh Muslim University Alumni Association, International Hindi Association of Washington DC, Sikh Coalition of Maryland and Sikh Association of Baltimore.
