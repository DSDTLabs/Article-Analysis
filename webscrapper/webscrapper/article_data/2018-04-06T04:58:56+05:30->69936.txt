NEW DELHI: Continuing with his assault on   over the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,   president   on Thursday shared a video of   purportedly claiming that the Act had been scrapped and PM Modi had kept quiet about it.

 "See how Rahul Gandhi fictitiously revokes the SC/ST Act to incite hatred in society," Shah tweeted while sharing a video of Rahul purportedly making the remark while addressing an election rally in  .
 
 Shah shared the video before dining with a Dalit family on the second day of his Odisha visit. He has been regularly sharing meals with Dalit families on his trips as part of the agenda to woo the community.
 
 BJP has aggressively tried to counter the opposition's bid to paint it as anti-Dalit since the SC made alterations in the SC/ST Act.
 
 Senior party members have disagreed with the SC verdict and a review petition was filed on which the apex court will start hearing soon. BJP has accused the opposition of inciting mob violence in which nine lives were lost.
 
 Concerned about the party's poll prospects, BJP functionaries are on an overdrive to assuage the Dalit community that it had no role in the recent court verdict. BJP is also wary about the opposition's onslaught over reservations and is keen to avoid a repeat of the Bihar assembly polls when it was accused of attempting to tweak the quota system after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's statement.
