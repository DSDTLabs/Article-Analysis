The special investigation team probing the actress rape case is learnt to have recorded the statement of  , actress and former wife of Dileep, as part of making her a witness in the case.

 “The actress’ statement was taken at a flat in Ernakulam by a top police officer who visited her in private over a week ago,” sources close to SIT said. They said the team had met the actress earlier too but SIT members refused to confirm it.
 
 The bail petition filed by Dileep in the high court had also claimed that the actor wouldn’t be able to influence the witnesses as Manju was one of the main witnesses. “Reference is made to two other witnesses, the complainant and Mrs Manju Warrier, who appeared to have been questioned by the additional director general of police. These witnesses can never be influenced by the petitioner (Dileep) (sic),” the petition reads.
 
 Meanwhile, ‘Pulsar’ Suni’s advocate BA Aloor said his client would move court for permission to record a statement under Section 164 CrPC in the wake of new developments in the case.
