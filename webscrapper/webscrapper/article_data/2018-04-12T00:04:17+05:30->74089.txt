MUMBAI: A 50-year-old   of  , who had not reported for work since a week, was found dead in the bathroom of her flat in a   building at   (East), on Wednesday. Manisha Bhave’s death was discovered around 10am after neighbours complained to the police about a foul smell emanating from her third-floor flat. 

 A neighbour called the police control room and Andheri cops entered the flat after breaking open the door. They found her decomposed body in the bathroom. 
 
 Bhave, a history professor at the   college, had not reported at the college since April 4. She had lived alone in the flat for 12 years since her divorce and did not have any children. 
 
 “No one in the building knew of her death or thought of checking on her whereabouts. It was a foul odour from the flat that prompted Bhave’s neighbours to alert cops. It is suspected that she might have fallen in the bathroom after suffering a cardiac arrest,” DCP   told TOI. 
 
 Police do not suspect any foul play.
 
 Cops are questioning the college management why it did not check up on the academic, though she had not turned up for almost a week. 
 
 “The autopsy report will give a clear picture about the cause of death. At present, a accidental death report (ADR) has been registered,” said Andheri police senior inspector Pandit Thorat.
 
 College officials refused to speak on the professor’s demise.
