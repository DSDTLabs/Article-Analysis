NEW DELHI: Noting the heinous nature of the crime, a special court on Tuesday awarded double-life imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs 1 lakh on a man for raping his six-year-old  . The court took in consideration the mental and physical trauma the victim must have endured.

 Special   court of Additional Sessions Judge Rakesh Pandit noted that the accused had taken advantage vulnerable victim’s age. “Considering that the convict had taken advantage of the tender age of the child who could not protect herself and that the convict exploited the piousness of the relationship, the facts do not demand a lenient view,” the court observed.
 
 The victim had given an account of her ordeal due to her maternal uncle. The prosecution relied on the victim’s statements that show that the convict forced her to have oral sex and later raped her on February 28, 2014. Though the girl warned him that would complain to her mother, the man told the child that her mother could do him no harm.
 
 In his defense, Kumar had argued that “no such thing” had taken place. Through his lawyer, he claimed that there was dispute between him and the victim’s mother, and he being falsely implicated.
 
 But the court referred and relied on the forensic tests and inferred that the victim was subjected to “penetrative sexual assault”. “So, in these circumstances, the prosecutrix was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that accused had committed aggravated penetrative sexual assault,” said ASJ Pandit.
 
 The court sentenced the man to life imprisonment under Section 376 ( ) and another life term under Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of Protection of Children Against   (POCSO) Act. 
 
 Besides the life term court also fined the man Rs 50,000 on each count and directed that Rs 25,000 of the Rs 50,000 would be given to the victim.
