ALLAHABAD: They might be separated by   of their states but their   towards lord Shiva seems to be the factor that unites them.   from states like Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand are thronging Allahabad to collect water from Sangam during the holy month of Shrawan, before they march towards Varanasi's Kashi Vishwanath temple. 

 Amid chants of Shiva mantra and Shiv Tandav Stotram, the kanwariyas are marching bare foot, looking forward to offer 'jalabhishek' to please lord Shiva.
 
 "It is not only during Magh Mela, Kumbh or Ardh Kumbh that people assemble in Allahabad from across the globe. Devotees of lord Shiva come here every year from far flung states to take water from Ganga," said AK Mishra, a city-based priest. 
 
 Nitin along with his group of seven kanwariyas arrived at Dashashwamegha ghat on Thursday to collect water from Sangam. "This was the first time when he, along with his friends, decided to don the saffron attire of kanwariyas and take part in all rituals associated with the month of Shrawan," he said. 
 
 Balak Ram and his family members, who hail from Sasaram in Bihar, too arrived at the ghat to collect the holy water. 
 
 "Scores of people from our village come to Sangam every year to participate in kanwar yatra as Sangam holds a lot of significance in our religious books. The locals provide us with potable water and eatables," said Balak Ram.
 
 Manoj Awasthi and his younger brother come from all the way from Rewa in Madhya Pradesh to offer their tributes to lord Shiva. 
 
 On Thursday, the Dashashwamedh ghat at Daraganj and Sangam wore a crowded look as thousands of kanwariays arrived at the ghat to take water from the holy river before starting their journey to Kashi Vishwanath temple, Padila Mahadeo temple and Baijnath Dham. 
 
 Officials at Daraganj police station said the strength of kanwariyas has increased after the second Monday of Shrawan month and we are maintaining a strict vigil in and around the ghat area.
