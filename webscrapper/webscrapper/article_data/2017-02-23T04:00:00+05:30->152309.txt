Markets regulator Sebi has directed mutual funds (MFs) to provide an exit option for all investors before making investments in derivatives. This is applicable to MF investors whose scheme information documents (SIDs) do not envisage investments in derivatives.

 “However, prior to the scheme commencing participation in derivatives, all investors of such schemes shall be given exit option with no exit load for 30 days, as against exit option to only dissenting unit holders mandated earlier,” Sebi said.
 
 MF schemes, whose SIDs do not envisage investments in derivatives, were required to obtain positive consent from a majority of the unit holders before commencing investment in derivatives earlier. However, Sebi received representations to the effect that obtaining the mandatory positive consent from a majority of unit holders was challenging due to the vast geographical spread of unit holders.
 
 The representations urged the regulator to do away with the requirement. Following this, the ‘Mutual Fund Advisory Committee’ of the regulator recommended that “for participation in derivatives market by such schemes, the requirement of obtaining positive consent should be dispensed with and all investors of the scheme should be given exit option with no exit load.”
 
 “Based on the above considerations and in view of prudent investment norms that are in place for investment in derivatives by mutual funds, it has been decided that for introduction of derivative investments in an existing scheme, the requirement of obtaining positive consent from majority of unit holders shall no longer be applicable,” the regulator said.
 
 Existing schemes of MFs, whose SIDs do not envisage investments in derivatives, can participate in derivatives market after disclosing the extent and the manner of the proposed participation to the unit holders, SEBI stated. “The risks associated with such participation shall be disclosed and explained by suitable numerical examples,” it said.
