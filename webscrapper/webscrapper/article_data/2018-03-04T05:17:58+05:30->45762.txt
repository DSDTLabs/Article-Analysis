NEW DELHI: An unidentified man died on early Saturday when a fire engulfed a night   operating out of a tent in Dandi Park, north Delhi. 

 Around 15 people were sleeping in the tent at the Delhi governmentâ€™s   complex on route to ISBT Kashmiri Gate when the fire broke out around 1am. Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) has issued a show-cause notice to the voluntary organisation managing the shelter. 
 
 A decision is also expected next week on whether to shut down all temporary shelters set up in tents as the temperatures have started rising.
 
 Fire department officials said three fire tenders were sent around 1am. The fire, which was doused in an hour, started in the tent situated next to a porta cabin.
 
 Police officers said the charred body was found during the cooling operations. A preliminary probe revealed that the victim was in his early 30s. The body has been sent for an autopsy and the police are trying to identify him from the register of the NGO. A case has been registered at Kashmere Gate police station.
 
 Investigating officers suspect that the fire might have started from a beedi. Some occupants, sources said, were probably smoking inside the tent, which is not permitted. The caretaker of the shelter, who was also sleeping inside the tent, was rescued by other inmates. 
 
 According to DUSIB member Bipin Rai, the NGO responsible for managing the shelter has been asked to explain the reasons behind the fire. According to the rules governing the   shelters, smoking is not allowed on the premises. Also, the caretaker is assigned the task of preventing any unusual activity at night. 
 
 A DUSIB official pointed out that preliminary inquiries indicated that caretakers managed to alert those sleeping inside. However, one person who was sleeping at the extreme corner got trapped as the tent collapsed, blocking the escape route.
