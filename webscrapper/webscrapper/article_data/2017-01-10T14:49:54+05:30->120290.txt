NEW DELHI:   has stirred the pot by excluding   from his list of greatest-ever Indian captains, while hailing   as the 'dada captain'.

 "By far, Dhoni is the best captain I have seen. My salaam to a dada captain. With so many wins under his belt, no one can even come close to Dhoni. He is easily India's most successful captain, by a distance. He is someone who never chased the chair.
 
 "He is someone who never chased milestones. Otherwise, he wouldn't have retired after 94 Tests in Australia," Shastri said.
 
 Incidentally, Shastri, in his capacity as team director, was the first to speak out on how selectors would have to take a call on the future leadership of the ODI team while keeping the 2019 World Cup in mind. He had also said that Dhoni would take the call on retiring from captaincy on his own. Shastri is happy his judgment was spot-on. 
 
 "This has given Virat (Kohli) time till the Champions Trophy to prepare for the title defence. MS has won everything there is to win, he really has nothing to prove," Shastri said, adding that Kohli has a long way to go.
 
 Incidentally,   is second in Shastri's list of great captains. He then named   for winning successive Test series in West Indies and England in 1971. Shastri also named Tiger Pataudi and also mentioned the name of Sunil Gavaskar for leading the side in the 1984 World Series win.
 
 "The names that follow in that list are a fair distance behind Dhoni. They are Kapil Dev, who led India to the World Cup title in 1983 and because of whom we won the Test series in England in 1986. And Ajit (Wadekar) in an era before there was One-day cricket, when we won successive Test series in the West Indies and then England in 1971. And of course, Tiger (Pataudi) for his flamboyance. Baaki koi nahi (there is no one else)," he added.
