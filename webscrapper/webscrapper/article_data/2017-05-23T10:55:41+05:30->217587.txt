AURANGABAD: In their third agitation in less than a month against water scarcity,   residents on Monday resorted to a ‘handa andolan’ in front of civic body’s office.

 Misarwadi residents on Monday threatened to lay an internal water supply line in the locality linked with the civic body’s water supply network and skip water charges.
 
 The alleged apathy of the civic officials prompted the residents’ demand. The residents said they would connect the Mirsarwadi area with the main water supply line installation and resolve the water scarcity issue permanently within the next eight days. “But we will not pay annual water charges to the civic body,” said  , one of the protesters.
 
 Chavan said the residents had given enough time to the   ( ) to make arrangements for water supply.
 
 The residents said that the adamant civic administration is paying no heed to residents who have been undergoing immense pain, hardship and face difficulties in fetching water.
 
 On April 27, when residents had launched their first agitation, civic chief D M   had promised quick action. He also conducted a site visit, but the AMC made no provision of water supply. Later, the residents took out a morcha on May 8. On Monday, they once again staged a demonstration.
 
 More than 7,000 Misarwadi residents have been facing severe water scarcity for the past many years as the area is not linked to the civic body’s water supply network. Residents buy water supplied by private agencies. Each of them reportedly spend around Rs 1,000 a month on water only because the AMC is delaying installation of the water supply line.
 
 Another resident said the civic body should immediately start laying a water pipeline to provide respite to the residents. “If the civic body is unable to provide water through taps with immediate effect, it should supply water through tankers,” he said. 
 
 Apart from this, residents are also demanding better roads, drainage lines and streetlights in the locality.
