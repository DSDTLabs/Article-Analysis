Nagpur: Two days after several discrepancies were noticed in the BCom final year question paper of ‘Financial Accounting’, Nagpur University administration is yet to act on it. About 60 marks questions were found to be full of discrepancies, as pointed by the students and later endorsed by the teachers.

 Though NU administration is tight-lipped about any decision in this regard, Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Neeraj Khaty said they would be seeking an experts’ opinion, before deciding on future course of action. Though the students had complained to the invigilators at centres when the discrepancies came to notice on Tuesday, the director informed that he was yet to receive its copy. He said he came to know about students written complaint from his clerk.
 
 “I am yet to go through it as complaint was with our clerk. But after reading in the newspapers, we’ve decided to seek vice chancellor SP Kane’s permission for taking an expert opinion,” he told TOI.
 
 This is third such blunder from the Exam Section after it earlier messed up with BBA and MSW papers held on March 20 and April 3 respectively. In these cases, the issues pertained to old and new course question papers, yet they generated lot of anxiety among students. In BBA paper, NU was forced to even hold an optional re-exam. The discrepancies were found in three questions comprising 20 marks each. 
 
 According to students, the paper setter had copied the question paper from one of the guides and randomly changed numbers in the balance sheet which was part of questions.
