SURAT:   and surrounding areas have requested   to order central government to waive off 20 per cent of capital gain tax imposed on total sale value of agricultural land. 

 A letter in this connection was written by the farmers from Surat and surrounding areas to the Supreme Court stating that they happen to be the highest tax paying community in India. Most of the urban farms form a part of the town-planning scheme, where the farmers have to surrender 40 per cent of the land to municipal corporation and urban development authority. 
 
 After the surrender of the land, farmers are left with 60 per cent of the land on which betterment charges or incremental contribution has to be paid. To pay these charges, farmers need to sell a portion of the land in order to generate funds for payment of the charges.
 
 Thus, the farmers are left with 50 per cent of their original agricultural property without earning any income from secession of the land. Now when farmers try to sell the remaining land in future, they can’t without paying 20 per cent of capital gains tax on total sales value of the land.
 
 Rajiv Bhatarkar, a farmer who wrote the letter on behalf of the urban farmers, said, “In terms of lifetime wealth, we have to incur massive loss of 70 per cent in our agriculture land. As compared to urban farmers, no other community, including businessmen and industrialists, sacrifice such a large extent of their wealth to the government.” 
 
 Bhatarkar added, “The only option left to urban farmers is to convert their agricultural land holding into non-agricultural (NA) land holding to ensure that the loss in value of land is reduced.”
