PURULIA: Chief minister   on Wednesday left an administrative meeting at   mid-way, reportedly after BDOs and other officials were unable to give satisfactory feedback on their work, particularly the mid-day meal scheme at primary schools. This is the first time the CM walked out of such a meeting.   has held over 200 administrative meetings since she became the chief minister in 2011. 

 Coming out of the meeting, Banerjee said, "They (the officials) have not executed the instructions given to them. I have told the chief secretary that I am very firm and straight-forward in such matters. I won't hold an administrative meeting here till the district administration does what it is supposed to do. Since they haven't, I left mid-way."
 
 Elaborating on reasons why the district administration had incurred her wrath, the CM said, "We had asked each of the ICDS centres to recruit one person at a time under the MGNREGA scheme for mid-day meals at all primary schools. But the ICDS centres failed to follow that directive. I don't like lapses. The DM has joined quite recently, but other district officials did not do their work properly. I can't accept this."
 
 The CM, however, was satisfied over another meeting she held with the Purulia Chamber of Commerce. "Work on the industrial front has been very positive. Purulia has very good industrial prospects. Besides, we are conducting a survey with the   to ascertain the mineral wealth and decide how we can use it to further industrialisation," she said.
