AHMEDABAD: In a huge relief for 37 students of   in Meghaninagar, the education department has decided they will be able to take the board exams as external or private candidates. The decision was taken to ensure that no student wastes a year. Meghaninagar police arrested the trustees of the school — Suresh   and Harish Desai — while the administrator, identified as Pritesh Patel, and other accused persons have gone underground. It came as a shock for the students of the school when they learnt, ahead of the board exams for class X on Monday, that their school was no longer affiliated to the   board.

 Taking up the issue seriously, the board had lodged a complaint against Patel and three trustees including Dave and Desai and a clerk of the school for fooling students and collecting fees of Rs 9.58 lakh without any approval from the board.
 
 According to the complaint lodged by education inspector Paresh Parmar, classes 9th and 10th were running on the campus of the New Navchetan School without permission.
 
 “The school had not even furnished the details of the teachers to the board. The school administration had even failed to furnish board exam slips to students in time,” said inspector A D Gohil of Meghaninagar police station. Gohil said that as it was a question of the future of the students, police acted swiftly and arrested Dave and Desai and were searching for the other accused.
