They want to be fighter pilots,   officers and policewomen. The Delhi contingent of the   for the   has girls from DU colleges like LSR, Kalindi, Maitreyi, Gargi, Shivaji, JMC, Dyal Singh,   and more. In the middle of parade rehearsals, these girls tell us that for most of them, NCC is a stepping stone to a career in uniform.

  For them, the   (NCC) is not an extracurricular activity that is done to get some extra attendance from the college. It is rather taking one step in the career that they have already chosen for themselves. It is not easy to get into the   Camp (RDC) as part of the NCC, the girls at the RDC have done their bit of the struggle to reach this level. Some have been part of the NCC for three years now, and have gotten their first chance to be part of the camp this year. For the girls who are in the RDC, and have been selected to participate in the Republic Day Parade, this is just the beginning of their journey into the field of combat forces. The ultimate goal for these girls from different colleges of DU is not only to get just trained for the future, but also serve the nation. While most of them had gone to practice at the Rajpath for the final day, DT spoke to some of the DU girls who are part of the NCC’s Delhi contingent about what inspired them to join the camp, and what is it that drives them to undergo such rigorous training.
 
  
 My dad is a Subedar-Major in the Army. Since my childhood, I wanted to get into the combat forces. I have done my RDC in junior wing for two years. This is my second year in the senior wing. I think this is the first step towards the future that I have chosen for myself. The ultimate aim is to get into the Army and serve the nation.

 I joined the NCC while I was in school. After I entered college, I joined it again and this is my second year in it. The training imparted here is preparing us for the future. People might think that women can’t get into combat forces, but I don’t agree. I wish to show people that we are no less.

 I joined NCC because I wanted to get into the  . My family supports my decision completely. I had once seen a documentary on the lives of army officers, and that was also one of the reasons why I chose to become one.

 It is my mother’s wish to see me as part of the Indian Army. There are members in my extended family who are in the Army, so she wants me to make her proud. For my parents, we are their sons who can serve the nation and work hard as well.

 I have been a part of the NCC for the last three years. It is not easy to get selected for the R-Day parade. Though most of the students in this batch come from a defence background, there is nobody in my family who is from this field. So, the urge to learn and be a part of this comes from the fact that I have to do something on my own. I want to join the Delhi Police in future. While everyone else is thinking of joining the Indian Army, I think the police work equally hard, and we must consider that too that as a career choice.

 I have been part of the NCC in my college for the last two years. Since my dad is an Indian Air Force officer, he was the one who induced the interest in me for this field. I want to experience his life and see what he has been doing all through these years. Following in my dad’s footsteps, I want to join the Air Force after this. Women are no less than anyone. It is important that we rise above this classification, and see each other as hard working individuals.

 This month of training at RDC has taught me a lot. I have come across several new people, learnt so much and explored the options that I can take up for my future. Like most students here, I also want to serve the country as an Army officer. The opportunities and the exposure that one gets here are immense. It feels great to know that several young girls are keen on joining the combat forces. For most of us, who are into it, we are doing it not just as an extracurricular activity, we are genuinely interested in taking this up in the future.

 It has been two years since I joined NCC. I want to join the Indian Army because it is my parents’ wish to see me as an Army officer. The ranks of this job and the opportunities that one gets here interest me. My maternal grandmother and grandfather are retired Army officers, so I want to be the next generation to serve the country from our family. My family supports me in my decision completely and it is not right for anyone to think that women can’t get into combat forces as they are capable of doing anything.

 I have been part of the NCC for the last three years. My dad is in the Army and he is one of the biggest reasons why I wanted to get into this field. I want to join the Air Force as a pilot, and NCC is the platform that gives you the opportunities and the right exposure to know about the armed forces. It is also the first step for us to know about the defence forces. The training, coming together of different people from various parts of the country and the opportunities, it all makes us understand more about the forces and the work that we wish to do in the future.

 It has been three years since I have joined the NCC. I want to join the Air Force, that is why I am acquainting myself with the surroundings of the defence forces. There is nobody in my family who is from this background. I am the first girl from JMC in the last three years, who has made it to the RDC. This is the chance for me to represent my college as well as the camp. We should not judge our capability on the basis of our gender.

 When I see officers here, I get inspired to become like them. People think that how would one manage studies with this, but if you are really into this, then you can. My parents want me to join the Indian Army, that is why they asked me to join NCC. Dangal toh abhi aayi hai, par mere papa toh kabse kehte hain ki, meri betiyaan beton se kam nahin hain. The three women fighter pilots are a source of inspiration for us and have proven that women are no less.
