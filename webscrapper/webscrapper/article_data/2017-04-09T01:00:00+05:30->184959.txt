 is in love and may tie the knot next year with Bengaluru-based businessman  . The pretty actress tells us, “It is sort of an arranged-cum-love match. My bhabhi introduced me to Koushik on a common WhatsApp group as she thought he was a perfect match for me.” Lovey says that Koushik was unaware of her profession when they started talking. “He learnt I was an actor only after he looked me up on the internet. He then started watching my show and is now a fan,” she laughs. 

 Talking about what attracted her to him, she says, “He is a positive and sensible guy. I also get to learn so much from him. Our relationship is growing stronger with every passing day and I feel blessed to have him in my life.” The couple plans to get engaged later this year, but marriage will have to wait. She shares, “The wedding will happen only next year as we need time to focus on our respective careers.”
 
 On the work front, Lovey is currently on a self-imposed break. “I left ' ' after being a part of it for almost three years, during which the show went in for three generation leaps. I needed a break due to personal reasons, but I will surely return with something good,” says she, adding, “I plan to continue working after marriage. My future in-laws are progressive and love to watch me on screen. However, apart from acting, I also plan to explore other avenues in the entertainment business.”
