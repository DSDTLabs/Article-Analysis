HYDERABAD: One of the two sons of the Bangladeshi businessman, who was picked up from   and let off few days ago, is still under police vigil as he was drawn towards terrorism. And what's disturbing, he's still a minor and had turned into an   sympathizer. Officials feel they nipped the threat in the bud.“He watched terror videos and read Qaida content on internet. Since he was a minor, we counselled him and let him go. But, he is still under watch,'' said a top Telangana police officer. He's not in touch with any terror outfit or handler, but closely follows developments in terrorism.

 A Bangladeshi national, Abdullah, was recently arrested in   in Uttar Pradesh for alleged links with a terror outfit,   (ABT), as he allegedly provided logistical support to associates.
 
 Abdul Malek, father of the minor, made money during his stay in India since 2009 and was in possession of an Indian Passport, which he obtained fraudulently. Malek is an acquaintance of an on-the-run ABT member and intelligence sleuths launched a manhunt for him. Police tracked down Malek for clues on Abdullah's whereabouts. During investigations, police stumbled upon the fact that Malek's minor son was turning into a radical. Officials said a boy, displaying inclination towards terror, is a matter of concern.
 
 “This is another case of self-radicalisation through social media. Family members were not aware about the minor's activities,'' an officer said. Interrogation of Malek and his two sons did not give leads on ABT member, a fugitive, who's on their radar. Police have registered a case against Malek family under Passport Act, since they confessed to have illegally obtained an Indian Passport. They were also booked for cheating.
