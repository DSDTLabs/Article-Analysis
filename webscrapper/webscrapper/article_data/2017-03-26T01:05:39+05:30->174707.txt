NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement on Saturday that Aam Aadmi Party would do away with   on residential properties if it was victorious in the municipal corporation elections created a storm, with BJP and Congress slamming the party for a proposal that could aggravate the problems of the cash-strapped civic bodies.

 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that after two years of the   government asking the corporations to collect   assiduously, especially in unauthorised colonies, “it is shameful that today CM Arvind Kejriwal is saying this”. To this, VP Pandey, leader of the House in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, added, “If such a major source of revenue is stopped, the civic bodies will become beggars dependent on the state government.”
 
 Satya Sharma, mayor in EDMC, said that the corporation had already waived penalties on overdue house tax, but the entire tax could not be removed. BJP’s Subhash Arya, leader of the House in SDMC, elaborated that property tax was impossible to execute. “According to Section 113A of the Delhi Municipal Act, 1957, house tax is obligatory tax and can’t be waived. Moreover, the state government has made it conditional on us to increase house tax revenue in order to qualify for a part of the financial assistance it gives.”
 
 Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken dismissed the proposal as a “jumla” and claimed instead to have prepared a proper roadmap on how to make the corporations financially self-reliant. “We are not making empty promises, but telling the people how we will do this,” he declared.
