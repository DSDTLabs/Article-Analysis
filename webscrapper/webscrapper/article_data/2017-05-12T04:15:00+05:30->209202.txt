NAGPUR: Lakadganj police have recovered betel nut worth more than Rs20 lakh after arresting two persons in a case of cheating. The arrested persons have been identified as   and Rajendra Chambhare. 

 Police said one of the accused, Mukesh Kumar, who is yet to be arrested, had duped trader   by delivering betel nuts to Khan and Chambhare instead of taking the consignment to Delhi. 
 
 Kumar had, on at least two occasions earlier, delivered Nagriya’s consignment to Delhi. On May 2, Kumar brought a different vehicle to take the consignment of 323 sacks of betel nut weighing around 21 tonnes to Delhi. Considering Kumar’s good service, Nagriya had allowed him to leave for Delhi with the consignment. When Kumar became untraceable, Nagriya lodged a complaint at Lakadganj police station. A team, under PI SM Mane, cracked the case in less than a week’s time.
