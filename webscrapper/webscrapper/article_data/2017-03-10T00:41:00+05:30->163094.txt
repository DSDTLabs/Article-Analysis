Panaji: Members of the Mhadei Bachao Abhiyan (MBA) expressed their protest against the Kalsa project in Kankumbi on Thursday and urged the Central government to take the matter seriously. They were speaking to media personnel on Wednesday. 

 “The life of many animals in the forest area is in danger due to the Kalsa project. We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will come to the conclusion that Karnataka is acting irresponsibly and therefore be told to stop the project,” said president of the abhiyan, Nirmala Sawant.
 
 Environmental activist Rajendra Kerkar said, “By going ahead with the project, Karnataka is going to destroy not only environmental ecology but also the water resources of Goa.” He added that Karnataka had built earthen embankments which were obstructing the natural flow of water coming into the the Mhadei wildlife sanctuary.
