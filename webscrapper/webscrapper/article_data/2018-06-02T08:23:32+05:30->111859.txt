AHMEDABAD: The popular Hindi song might tell you that ‘Tu jahan jahan chalega, tera saaya saath hoga’ (Wherever you go, your shadow will follow you) but it might not prove to be true - momentarily though - for next few days in  . The citizens will be able to experience the phenomenon, known as   Day (ZSD) where the shadows will disappear completely for a while.

 It is a general belief that the Sun is directly overhead at 12noon every day. But due to the Earth’s rotation around the Sun, only the region between   of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn experience the phenomenon twice a year. Dhananjay  , an Ahmedabad-based science communicator, said that for Gujarat, the ZSDs in major cities fall in June and July. Some parts of   experience it in late May.
 
 
  
 
 “The Earth’s axis is tilted at the angle of 23.5 degrees. Thus, different times of the year sees northern and southern hemisphere facing the Sun. We thus experience change of seasons. The path of the Sun in our sky is also not linear and thus it generally doesn’t come directly overhead,” said Rawal.
 
 “Only a few know that the phenomenon actually helped the ancient Egyptians to calculate diameter of the Earth and tilt of the planet’s axis while observing the ZSD around 250 BCE,” he said.
 
 Amateur astronomy clubs in Gujarat have planned a slew of activities to engage science enthusiasts and children in the activities related to ZSD.
