MUMBAI: A biological father's name cannot be replaced with that of the adoptive father in the birth record of a child only on the basis of a registered  , the   ruled on Thursday.

 A bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Anuja Prabhudessai said an order of a competent court is necessary for the change.
 
 A couple -the mother of a 13-year-old girl and her second husband -moved the HC after the deputy registrar, births and deaths, in August 2016 refused to change her birth record.The woman had divorced the girl's biological father and received permanent custody of their daughter.After she remarried, an   deed was executed in May 2003 with the biological father as a party to it. After getting the deed registered, the couple applied for the girl's birth record to be changed.
 
 The couple's advocate argued that the deputy registrar could not have rejected their plea for change in the girl's birth record based on a registered adoption deed. He said under section 16 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, whenever a registered document is presented to court, it should presume that the adoption is done in accordance with its provisions. But the judges pointed out that section 16 lays down a rule of evidence and that such presumption will be available only when the document is placed before a court. The registrar, births and deaths, is not a court and cannot adjudicate whether the adoption is valid or not, they said.
