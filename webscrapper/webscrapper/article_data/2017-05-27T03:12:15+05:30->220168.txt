NEW DELHI: Amid rising terror threats,   has decided to have dedicated PCR vans with commando units. On Friday, police commissioner Amulya Patnaik flagged off the first batch of Parakram to be stationed at crowded locations. These commandos will be armed with latest equipment in order to be the first resistance wall in case of a 26/11-style terror attack.

 “In case of a terror attack, these men will be able to hold back until SWAT teams arrive. We have trained 10 teams and will get more,” police commissioner Patnaik told TOI. The contingent will also have women commandos.
 
 Each Toyota Innova van with an open hatch will be manned by three commandos armed with AKM rifles. The men were trained along with National Security Guards to take on suspects in crowded locations. 
 
 All vans are GPRS-enabled and fitted with pan-Delhi wireless communication. Their drivers will be armed with small weapons and have been trained by NSG on offensive and evasive driving, and firing in mobile mode. 
 
 The units will be posted at CP, ITO, Vijay Chowk, Palika Bazar, IP Marg, Saket Select City Mall, Vasant Kunj Mall, Pacific Mall (Subhash Nagar), Market/Mall Complex (Netaji Subhash Place), Akshardham and Lotus temples, and Jhandewalan. The unit will be under the operations cell headed by special commissioner (operations) Dependra Pathak.
