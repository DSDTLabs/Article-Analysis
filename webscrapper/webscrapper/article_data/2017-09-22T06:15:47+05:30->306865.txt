AHMEDABAD: After assuring the   last year that it was considering a “general policy” for   in  , the government went silent on the issue, and narrowed its submission on Thursday only to providing flats at concessional rates for high court staff and for the government pleader’s office.

 For the past few years, 429 such employees had been demanding plots in the vicinity of the HC campus, and began legal battle, said their advocate Amit Panchal.
 
 During hearing of the appeals filed by the HC employees, the state government on December 16, 2016 had told the high court, “The state government is considering a   to cover cases like the one involved in the present matter for the metropolitan cities of Gujarat state and an appropriate decision will be taken as expeditiously as possible, and preferably within a period of four months from today.”
 
 When the government did not do anything, the HC employees urged the court to direct the government to fulfil its promise. Under the pressure from the HC to keep its word, the government told the court today that a policy decision was taken on Wednesday for land at concessional rate for constructing highrise residential flats for eligible employees of the high court, as well as office of the government pleader.
 
 The state government chose to remain mum on the statement that it would make a “general policy” for providing houses for government employees in big cities of the state.
 
 A suo motu PIL has been pending before the high court since 2000 with regard to the government’s policy of allotting plots to its employees at concessional rates in Gandhinagar.
