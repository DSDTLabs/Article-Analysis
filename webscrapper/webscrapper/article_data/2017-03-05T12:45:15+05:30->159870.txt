BHUBANESWAR: Agriculture minister   on Saturday attributed the distress sale of tomatoes in Keonjhar district to overproduction. In a statement in the assembly, Maharathy said favourable weather conditions had helped tomato production in the district to go up, resulting in a fall in prices. Quoting the wholesale price index, he said nationally the price of vegetables was lower than that of last year. 

 The minister, however, was silent on setting up of infrastructure, particularly cold storages, a factor widely seen responsible for the distress sale of vegetables across the state. Official sources said Keonjhar has only one cold storage facility with a capacity of 5,000 tonne. 
 
 
 
 
 Maharathy said Keonjhar district collector N Thirumala Naik visited certain tomato growing villages and initiated discussion on setting up of a committee through which farmers could sell vegetables directly to retailers. The minister claimed he has also instructed authorities of the integrated tribal development agency (ITDA) to ensure purchase of tomatoes directly from the growers for residential schools. "Due to the intervention of the administration, local traders have been buying tomatoes directly from farmers since March 3 at Rs 120 per crate," he said.
 
  The farmers' wing of the BJP, which organised a massive protest here during the day, was far from impressed with the minister's statement.   president Sibaji Mohanty said the government has been regularly dishing out false promises.
