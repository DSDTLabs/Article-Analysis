GHAZIABAD: A year after GDA responded to a letter written by Federation of Association of Apartment Owners, for the re-installation of a   on   to restrict the movement of heavy motor vehicles in the residential area, no action has been taken.

 In a letter written to Ghaziabad Development Authority, the federation has demanded an answer from the GDA officials for the unexplained delay in the construction of a new height barrier despite an earlier investment of Rs 2.5 lakh on the same.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Alok Kumar, patron, FedAOA and a resident of  , a residential society in   said, “This is a huge failure on the part of the government as they failed to restore a structure to deter the plying of large trucks, tractors and school buses on a road of a residential locality, thus increasing the risk of accidents in the residential area. We had persuaded the SP (traffic) and the GDA officials to conduct a survey in this area for assessing the requirement of a barrier and after it was approved by the authorities, the stone crusher mafia managed to demolish it in the presence of the traffic police and the GDA officials.”
 
 Lack of a barrier has been a longstanding woe for the residents of Ahinsa Khand-II. “There is a school here who has opposed the installation of the barrier because they have their school buses entering the Pushta road from NH-24. But there is another road right behind this road that connects to Pushta road and can be used for the same purpose, but to no avail. The illegal stone-crusher has also been operational without notice,” said D K Maurya, RWA president, Niho Scottish Garden, a residential society in Indirapuram. 
 
 The GDA officials could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.
