LUDHIANA: Government Senior Secondary School, Sekhewal -- where last year students appeared for final exams sitting on mats -- on Wednesday got 50 desks, thanks to  .

 Around 800 students study in the school, which lacked desks for about 100. In March 2017, when the education department made the school as examination centre for open board exam, some students had to sit on mats to write the paper. After that, the school authorities borrowed desks from a nearby private school as an interim measure. Since then, the school had been requesting the education department for providing desks or finding a donor.
 
 On Wednesday, the company provided 50 dual desks, sports equipment, music instruments and science equipment for the laboratory. A function was organised on the school premises where the students were overjoyed to see the new writing tables.
 
 Principal   said, “We had been looking for donors for long. Due to shortage, we had to make three students sit on one dual desk, while others attended classes on mats. In winters, students found it hard to sit on the mats. I approached district education officer (secondary)   and asked her to get some desks under   activities. I am glad that United India   Company Limited helped us. They have promised to keep assisting us in future too.”
 
 A Class VI student said, “In winters, we felt cold on the mats. We are happy as tough days have ended now.”
