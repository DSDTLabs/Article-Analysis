Chandigarh: The municipal councillors are running from pillar to post to get the bicycle tracks of their wards repaired after civic contractors have dug these up to lay pipelines and install street lights. Three councillors shared with TOI how they were struggling get the construction mud cleared off these paths.

 Ward 18 councillor   said: “It has been more than two months since the contractor concerned dismantled the bicycle track to lay some pipelines. We have filed many complaints with the municipal corporation for urgent repair of the tracks but no action has followed.” Ward 20 councillor   said: “The contractors have ploughed a large stretch but failed to restore it, due to which, cyclists can no longer use these tracks. The civic authorities need to either chalk out a plan for timely reconstruction or do it in patches.”
 
 Ward 1 councillor   said he had suggested using cement instead of paver blocks for the tracks, since it would cost the same and prevent the tracks from becoming too rough. “But the   seems to have made all decisions beforehand and accommodated no such change in its plan.” He said the civic authorities should complete the repair of the tracks before monsoon, so that the mud that was dug out didn’t turn damp and become slush.
 
 He called for installing superior reflectors on the roads to prevent accidents at night.
