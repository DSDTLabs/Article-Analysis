GHAZIABAD: A   of a traffic constable pulling the hair of an autorickshaw driver and a voice from behind seeking a bribe of Rs 100 from him went viral in the social media on Friday. The location has been identified as near the bus stand in   under Kotwali police station. However, it is not clear who shot the 27-minute mobile phone video and the date on which it was shot. 

 The driver could be heard crying for help and asking the constable to seize the vehicle but stop beating him.
 
 Although SP (traffic) SN Singh denied the bribery allegation, he said an inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the facts. 
 
 The constable has been identified as Rajiv Kumar.
 
 “I have seen the video. According to the constable, the auto driver had parked his vehicle in the middle of the road and caused a traffic jam on the busy stretch. The constable also claimed that he had issued a challan to the driver for this offence. As far as bribery allegation is concerned, how could a cop seek money openly in a crowded place? It looks like someone in the background is saying this. The traffic inspector has been asked to verify all these facts,” Singh told TOI. 
 
 However, the senior official accepted that the constable should not have pulled the driver’s hair. “It should not have happened. Appropriate action will be taken for this, he added.
