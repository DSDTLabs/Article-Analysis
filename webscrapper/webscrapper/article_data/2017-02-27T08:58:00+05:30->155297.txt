MANGALURU: The boy who trotted to college on horseback has now opened a   to teach the sport to the public. 

  Avinand Achanahally's   is now about two months old. It was a result of curious enquiries that came after seeing him taking the horse on Mangaluru roads. To impart basic training to his students, his stable now houses four animals, including a pony which goes by the name of Minto. 
 
  Avinand is the son of a planter couple, AL   and KU Roopa, from Hanbal village near Sakleshpur. The USP of his academy: Avinand assures that students will be able to ride their horses on their own after 22 classes of one-month duration. 
 
  Now, Avinand has 32 students ranging from a seven-year-old to a 60-year-old. He offers basic, intermediate and advanced horse riding courses to enthusiasts. "It improves physical fitness, burns around 650 calories in 30 minutes of continuous riding, strengthens muscles and is a stress buster,'' promises Avinand, whose love for equines led him to learn horseriding at Horse Stables in JP Nagar, Bengaluru. 
 
  Avinand, who did BCom at  , completed his masters in social work from the School of Social Work, Roshni Nilaya. 
 
  In the final year of his master's course, he started riding to college on horseback. His first ride was a seven-year-old Kathiawadi breed 'Sikander' which he bought for Rs 70,000 in Mysuru about three years ago. 
 
  Enthused by the response, Avinand wants to conduct horse riding crash courses as a summer camp in April.
