Thiruvananthapuram: Despite the city receiving summer rains, scarcity of water is still a major problem. Several areas in the city such as Ambalamukku and Kowdiar still face a water crisis. KWA’s pipe replacement works are also causing erratic supply to many areas.

  has only a single tanker truck to distribute water to the entire city. Incidentally, KWA is in possession of around 8 tanker trucks and all except one are under repair.
 
 Currently, a 10,000-litre capacity tanker truck is supplying water to the north and south divisions of KWA. Not only this tanker is insufficient to supply water to the entire city, this big tanker could not enter narrow byroads and lanes. In addition to two 10,000 litre tankers, KWA has four 9,000 litre and two 6,000 litre tankers to distribute water to houses located near narrow lanes.
 
 When contacted, an official of KWA said that seven tanker lorries were taken for testing and yet to be released from the government workshop. During summer, when KWA needed tankers to supply water to various areas, most of its tankers were in the workshop.
 
 “Since the trucks are used for distribution of drinking water, periodic test is necessary. As all the tankers were purchased at one time under the JICA-assisted water supply project, the test has to be done almost simultaneously. Unfortunately, this happens during March-May months. Also, the bills of maintenance of each truck would cost around Rs 50,000 which has to be approved by the office of managing director. This would delay the release of vehicles,” said an official.
 
 Sources said that some tankers were in workshop due to issues that could be settled with minor maintenance works. “Earlier KWA used to hire vehicles. Now that too has stopped,” sources said and added that some tanker lorries stopped service after KWA could not settle bills at the petrol pump.
