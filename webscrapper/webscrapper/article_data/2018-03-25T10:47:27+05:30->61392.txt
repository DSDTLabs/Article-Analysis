KANNUR: The second phase of the agitation by ‘Vayalkilikal’, the collective of the local residents of   in   district, will begin on Sunday with a march from Thaliparamba to Keezhattur, followed by erecting new shed in the   where the CPM had erected placards in the name of the field owners, saying that they were ready to give their land for development and maximum compensation should be given. The old shed was set on fire allegedly by the CPM workers on March 14.

 Though the government has asked the National Highway Authority of India ( ) to consider the possibility of having an elevated road to protect the watershed, the  , who claim they have the support of the majority of residents there, are adamant that even that would not be permitted through their paddy fields.
 
 The second round of agitation will have the participation of major political parties including the Congress and the BJP apart from environmental activists.
 
 In order to counter this campaign, the CPM had taken out a march on Saturday from Keezhattur to Thaliparamba to convince the people about the need of the bypass.
 
 CPM leader MV Govindan, who addressed the rally, said the bypass through Keezhattur would be made a reality at any cost, and said that it is a fake campaign that the bypass will destroy the entire paddy fields. Only around 6.5 acres of land would be filled in Keezhattur, claimed the CPM leader, who also rejected the   (KSSP) report, which said the environmental impact of the project would be huge and hence alternative means should be explored. He also said no hills would be demolished to fill the fields for the road.
 
 Though the CPM is hell bent of defeating the campaign by Vayalkilikal, the party has asked the cadres not to create any tension or clashes with the agitators. However, considering the volatile situation, police have strengthened vigil and large numbers of policemen have been deployed in the area.
