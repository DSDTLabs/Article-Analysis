Pune: A sessions court here on Monday rejected the anticipatory bail application of women's rights activist Trupti Desai and three others in a case registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and other criminal offences. 

 Additional sessions judge A K Patil held that Section 18 of the Act provides a bar on the grant of an anticipatory bail in such cases. Besides, the court upheld additional public prosecutor Vilas Ghogare-Patil's argument that custodial interrogation of the four accused was required for the recovery of cash Rs 27,000, two mobile handsets and a gold chain, allegedly snatched by the accused from the complainant, and an iron rod and a wooden stick used for assaulting him. 
 
 Desai’s lawyer Milind Pawar told TOI, “We will move an appeal against the trial court's order in the Bombay high court on Tuesday.” Pawar said, “While Section 18 does provides a bar on anticipatory bail, we had cited Supreme Court and High Court rulings which made an exception to this and held that the trial court must consider a prima facie case for or against the grant of such relief. There was an 11-day delay in the lodging of an FIR and the complaint itself appears to be planned and doubtful. For all his claim about the nature of assault, the complainant did not take any medical treatment in a hospital. We feel the court ought to have considered these factors.”
 
 Ghogare-Patil, pointed out the delay in lodging of the FIR was because the complainant was under fear of the accused. Following a July 11 directive, Makasare appeared before the court along with his lawyers Narayan Pandit and Sagar Kothari for presenting his case as per the provisions of the Act.
