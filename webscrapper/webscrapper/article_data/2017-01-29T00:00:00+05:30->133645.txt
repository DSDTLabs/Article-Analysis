‘My Saviour’, a mega bible stage production directed by   premiered recently in the capital city in the premises of the   School Ground, Kowdiar. The two hour long show narrated the life of Jesus Christ. More than 150 artistes performed in the musical drama which was said to have the biggest stage in the country for a Biblical show. The audience was transported to the streets of   as live sheep, camel, horses and goats strolled on the stage, adding originality to the act. The spectacular show with rich 3D visuals and monumental sets rendered an aesthetic feel to the onlookers. Taking episodes from the New Testament of the Bible, the play interpreted Jesus as a protector and not as a reformer. The dance-drama delivered the inner meanings of the sayings of   rather than showcasing the Lord’s miracles. A visibly delighted Pratheesh RP, who gave life to Jesus on stage, says, “It was an honour for an actor like me to don the role of Christ on stage. I felt blessed when many viewers from various parishes told me that they saw the real Christ on stage in me. I had done a lot of ground work before the act to know more about Jesus Christ’s features and mannerisms, apart from the well-known facts. I felt very spiritual while on stage. As homework I became vegetarian prior to the performance.” The show was well received and some of the audience could be seen with closed eyes, tears streaming down their cheeks during the crucifixion of the Christ on stage.
