MYSURU: With elections for the mayor’s post scheduled on Wednesday, hectic lobbying went on till the last minute from the two women corporators of the   party.

 Both women corporators made appeals to chief minister Siddaramaiah, who was in Mysuru, to consider their candidature.
 
 The elections will be held at Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar auditorium in   ( ) at 11.30 am. In-charge regional commissioner Shivayogi C Kalasad is the returning officer for the elections.
 
 While the mayor’s post has been reserved for SC (woman), the deputy mayor’s is for ST (woman). Both JD(S) and   have no SC woman corporator, while Congress, which is the single largest party, has two corporators who fit the bill.
 
 Both Congress corporators — Gandhinagar (ward 50) corporator Kamala R and Jayalakshmipuram (ward 23) corporator Bhagyavathi, are lobbying for the post. The corporators and their family members have already met senior party leaders to pitch their candidature.
 
 Siddaramaiah, who is in Mysuru to take part in various programmes and launch of development works, will finalize the mayoral candidate.
 
 The deputy mayor’s post, which is reserved for ST (woman), will go to JD(S) as neither Congress nor the BJP has a woman corporator from the ST community.
 
 JD(S) Kyatharamaranahalli (ward 61) corporator Indira Mahesh will likely be elected as deputy mayor unopposed. The four standing committee chairpersons’ posts will be shared by the BJP-JD(S) alliance.
 
 MCC council former opposition leader J S Jagadeesha said the party leaders are still discussing on the mayoral candidate. “The candidate will be finalized by leaders and will be directed to file the nomination,” he said.
