RAIPUR: A day after   chief   hogged the limelight with protest at the office of   (EOW), a group of farmers from his native village on Saturday staged a dharna in front of his residence here, demanding return of their land allegedly grabbed by the family. 

 A group of 15 people, said to be farmers from Kurudih village, reached the residence of Congress leaders here and began raising slogans, demanding return of their land which, they alleged, is in possession of Baghel family. Initially, police did not have any information about the protest by the farmers, who sat down in front of his house -holding placards and raising slogans against the Congress leader. 
 
 The farmers, headed by a local sarpanch, alleged that about 77 acres of their land is in the possession of Bhupesh Baghel's family and they don't even have road access because of alleged land grabbing by the influential family of state Congress chief. However, PCC chief Bhupesh Baghel had clarified earlier that he has nothing to do with the land in question being referred to by the farmers. After he came to know about protest, Congress leaders invited the farmers to his house and asked them about their grievances besides reiterating his position that he had nothing to do with the land concerned. Congress sources say that Baghel's political adversaries had plotted such a protest by the farmers in front of the house. After EOW registered cases against Congress leader, his wife and mother, PCC chief had went public alleging that it was the outcome of nexus between chief minister   and Janata Congress Chhattisgarh founder Ajit Jogi.
 
 Former CM Ajit Jogi's legislator son Amit Jogi reacted to PCC chief's remarks saying that state Congress chief's visit to EOW to office to surrender was a 'stunt' to garner sympathy. "If Baghel feel that EOW had registered a false case against him, he should move the court to quash the FIR instead of resorting to political gimmicks," he added.
