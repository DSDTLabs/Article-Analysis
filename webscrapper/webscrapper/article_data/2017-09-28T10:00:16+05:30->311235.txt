NEW DELHI: When students of the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT-D)’s Aravali hostel went for their breakfast on Tuesday morning, one of them found a   floating in the coconut chutney served to the students. This incident, which left many students unhappy with the hygiene situation in the hostel mess, has made the administration take several immediate steps to improve the   situation.

 A student,  , was the first one who sighted the dead mouse. “By the time I found it, many had already eaten the chutney,” Darokar wrote on his Facebook wall. He then informed the mess supervisor and blamed the night mess for this mistake.
 
 He, however, pointed out that even the hostel mess was not in good condition and wanted the administration to take the matter seriously.
 
 Informed of the incident,  , the house secretary and Amandeep Singh, the mess secretary of the hostel met with the warden and other officials and discussed the “irresponsible behaviour, poor hygiene, and poor infrastructure conditions.”
 
 Addressing the concerns of the students affected by the incident, the   director Ramgopal Rao informed that a committee of three wardens has been formed to investigate the matter and report on it soon.
 
  “I can assure you that some people in the mess where the incident took place are going to lose their jobs In the last one year we have been continuously renovating the hostels and the messes. It is taking time as the only time window we get for renovations is two months,” he told the students on social media.
