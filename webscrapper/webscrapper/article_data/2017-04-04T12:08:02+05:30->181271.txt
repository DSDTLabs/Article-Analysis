PUNE: The recent hike in Ready Reckoner (RR) rates will deal a major blow to affordable housing in the state.

 With no waiver or concession announced for the affordable housing segment in the state so far, the consumers will finally have to bear the burden of the cost escalation due to the hike in RR rates.
 
 Interestingly, states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and   have already issued various affordable housing policies, including huge discounts on stamp duty.
 
 “The state government had committed to do the same (offer discounts). On the contrary, land and building rates have been increased more than 12% in the outskirts of the city, where projects under affordable housing are coming up in a big way,” developer   said.
 
 The formation of the Pune   (PMRDA), when compared to the town planning, will increase the project approval costs manifold in the suburban areas, thus, making housing even more expensive for the consumers, Kulkarni added.
 
 Shrikant Paranjape, president, Credai, Pune (Metro), said increased rates will bring down the number of such projects, affecting government’s goal of housing for all. “The shortage in supply will also result in higher selling prices and land rates in the outskirts of the city,” he said.
 
 A policy recommendation put up to the state requesting for abolition of stamp duty, service tax, local body cess and VAT for affordable house buyers is pending. While developers said the same has been followed by other states where generous waiver in all taxes has been implemented.
 
 The hike has not gone down well with potential buyers. Kuldip Singh, a private firm employee looking to buy a property under affordable housing, fears that he would end up paying more for a small dwelling. “The rates in the outskirts is high and this will only increase the price of the low-cost housing. The government needs to look into it,” Singh added.
