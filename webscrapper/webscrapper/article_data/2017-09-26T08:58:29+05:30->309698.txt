 “The runway of the airport has been partly damaged due to the erection of the German hangers for the September 22 event,” director (operation) of the state civil aviation department, captain SP Singh, said. 
 
 The director added, “The district administration is incharge of the airport. It did not take the civil aviation department into confidence while allowing any such works at the airport, particularly along the runway. The civil aviation department will take necessary steps to get the damages repaired after getting official information in this regard.” 
 
 The runway of the airport, which was developed by the public works department (PWD) (building division) is 4,000 feet long and 250 feet wide.
 
 “Apart from reconstruction of the damaged part of the runway, the stone dust and stone chops laid along the sides of the runway will have to be removed as it may cause disturbances during landing and take-off,” Rameshwar Das, executive engineer of PWD, said after inspecting the area. 
 
 Das added, “Saryu construction, a Ranchi-based private agency, was given the task of erecting the hangers. Had the agency taken us into confidence before digging the area to set up the pillars, this damage could have been averted.”
