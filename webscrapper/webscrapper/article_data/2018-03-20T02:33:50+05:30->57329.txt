NEW DELHI: The share of   schools in the city’s school education system has been on the rise in the last four years, touching nearly 40% in 2016-17, having logged an increase of nearly 10% between 2014-15 and 2016-17. However, correspondingly, enrolment in Delhi government schools fell in the three financial years, giving rise to questions about the efficacy of government strategies to improve its schools. The Economic Survey, released on Monday, however, noted that Delhi government spent nearly Rs 6,712 extra on each student in the past year.

 According to the Economic Survey of Delhi 2016-17, the government increased its annual per student expenditure from Rs 54,910 to Rs 61,622 last year — an all-time high between April 2014 and March 2017 — as it focused on infrastructure and amenities in schools. 
 
 However, enrolment remained at the lower end of the spectrum compared with corresponding figures in the preceding fiscals. Enrolment was 16.1 lakh in 2013-14, fell to 15.1 lakh in 2015-16 and recovered marginally to 15.3 lakh in 2016-17.
 
 The survey also revealed that there exist schools in the capital that do not have basic necessities like electricity and playgrounds. More than 12% of the city’s schools do not have playgrounds, in clear violation of the Right to   Act that makes it mandatory for every school to do so. The reach of electricity has also not reached every school, with at least 0.1% of the total lacking a power connection. However, the survey pointed out that every school in the capital had access to toilets — for both girls and boys — and drinking water.
 
 The number of children attending pre-primary and primary schools in Delhi have also decreased though there are more children now than in the past fiscals in middle and secondary schools.
 
 The performance of students in CBSE’s Class X exams was calculated at around 92.4%, lower when compared with the 93.1% across India. The performance of Class V and Class X students in Delhi, according to the National Achievement Survey 2015, was lower than the national average.
 
 Interestingly, only two new universities in Delhi were started in the last seven years despite the need to accommodate a high number of students clearing the Class XII exams. The maximum increase in the number of colleges was five in the past year alone for professional education. On the other hand, 10 new technical institutes opened in Delhi after 2011, and enrolment in these institutes increased 54% since then.
 
 Of the students enrolled in institutions of higher education in Delhi, women comprised 48%, better than the national average of 46.3%.
