CHENNAI: Even as he was parrying questions on allegations linking him to an audio tape purportedly that of a college assistant professor asking some students to offer sexual favours to higher officials, governor Banwarilal   found himself in another controversy on Tuesday.

 
 
 Lakshmi Subramanian, a woman journalist, present at a press meet convened by the governor at the   on Tuesday evening, said she was shocked at Purohit patting her on her cheek.
 
  
  
  Soon after the meet, the journalist tweeted: “I asked Governor Purohit a question as his press conference was ending. He decided to patronisingly — and without consent — pat me on the cheek as a reply.”
 
  
  
  MP   was quick to react, tweeting, “Even if the intention is above suspicion, a person who holds public office has to understand that there is a decorum to it and violating a woman journalist’s personal space does not reflect the dignity or the respect which should be shown to any human being.”
