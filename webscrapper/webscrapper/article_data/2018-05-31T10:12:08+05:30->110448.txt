KOLKATA: The city continued to remain warm and humid with the   touching 36
  C and maximum relative humidity shooting up to 87% on Wednesday.

 
 Even though some of the neighbouring districts received thundershowers, Kolkata continued to sweat. But the weather could change on Thursday with a cyclonic circulation set to develop over Jharkhand. A thunderstorm could hit the city, predicted the   ( ).
 
 “Moisture from the sea is responsible for the humidity. Kolkata has not received a thunderstorm in the last 12 days. The depression that developed over east-central Bay of Bengal near Myanmar was sucking away all the moisture. “It hit the land on Wednesday and stopped attracting moisture which is good news for Kolkata. There should now be enough moisture to feed the circulation over Jharkhand and trigger a thunderstorm,” said RMC director GK Das. He said the storm could strike a day later if not on Thursday.
