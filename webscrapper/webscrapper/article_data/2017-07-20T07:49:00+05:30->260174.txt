Chandigarh: Consumers in Haryana will now have to pay more for electricity consumption in the remaining nine months of this financial year. The Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) has increased the tariff ranging between 25 paisa per unit to 50 paisa per unit for different sectors with effect from July 1.

 The commission has spared domestic consumers who use up to 150 units per month from the hike.
 
 Those consuming between 151-250 units will have to pay 25 paisa per unit more (Rs 5.25); 25 paisa per unit more (Rs 6.30) for using between 251-500 units and 35 paisa per unit more (Rs 7.10) for those using more than 500 units.
 
 Asked about the reasons for power tariff hike, HERC chairman Jagjeet Singh replied, “Because we have to recover the pending losses of Rs 1,010 crore.” He added that HERC has plans to start smart grids which require money and power distribution companies (discoms) in Haryana are already running into losses. “We are making our sincere efforts to recover pending power bills and check transmission losses too,” he said.
 
 HERC has also increased power tariff for non-domestic (commercial) consumers ranging between 30 paisa per unit to 45 paisa per unit. Commercial consumers of up to 5 kilowatt light transmission (LT) will have to shell out 30 paisa per unit more (Rs 6.35). Whereas the commercial consumers above 12 kilowatt LT will have to pay 45 paisa per unit more than what they are paying now.
 
 Similarly, for the high transmission (HT) industry above 50 kilowatt, HERC has affected an increase of 50 paisa per unit.
 
 Box: Farm sector spared
 
 However, the agricultural sector has been left untouched this time too from the tariff hike. Farmers are getting power supply for metered tubewell operations with motor up to 15 brake horsepower (bhp) at 10 paisa per unit and for unmetered tubewell operations with motor up to 15 bhp at a fixed rate of Rs 15 per bhp per month.
