BENGALURU: The  's (CID) special investigation unit may investigate the case of missing techie  , the high court said on Monday. 

 Justice   made this observation after the police commissioner indicated in his report that 80 officials deputed to the   (SIT), which is probing the case, are needed for other pressing duties, including assembly elections, and investigation can be continued by the special investigation unit. 
 
 The judge adjourned the hearing on a petition filed by Ajitabh's father Ashok Kumar Sinha to March 12, while asking police to show progress/result in the case.
 
 Additional Advocate general A G Shivanna said probe is on and there has been no concrete progress as yet. He said no transaction took place on the OLX platform where Ajitabh, 30, had advertised to sell his car. An unknown person called Ajitabh using a sim card which was obtained by submitting a fake ID proof. The card was used only for that call.
 
 Ashok Kumar Sinha claimed that despite registration of two FIRs by Whitefield police on December 20 and December 29, 2017, his son is yet to be traced.
