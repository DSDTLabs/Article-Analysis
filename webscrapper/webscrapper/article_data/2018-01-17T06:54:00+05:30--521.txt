Kolkata: West Bengal Pradesh Congress president   Chowdhury stoked the debate on the Congress-CPM alliance on Tuesday, three days ahead of the CPM central committee meeting in Kolkata from January 19 in which the party will finalise its draft political resolution for the congress in Hyderabad in April. 

 Chowdhury held that CPM’s breaking the alliance with Congress had helped BJP gain support in West Bengal. “CPM’s pulling out of the alliance went against the trust people had reposed in this alliance to fight Trinamool. This has in effect helped BJP use the political vacuum and emerge as a force,” he said.
 
 Chowdhury argued that CPM’s stand would lead to a division in opposition votes that Trinamool has been looking at. “Trinamool wants a four-cornered fight as that helps its candidates to sail safe,” he said. He also accused Trinamool of paving the way for BJP in Bengal.
