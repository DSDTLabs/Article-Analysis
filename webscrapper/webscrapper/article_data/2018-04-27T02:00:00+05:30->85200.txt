PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday asked the officials concerned to take necessary steps to increase conviction rate in cases registered under the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.

 He said a management information system (MIS) should be developed for real time monitoring of cases at different stages, such as post mortem, forensic test, status of submission of charge-sheet in court, status of trial, conviction, acquittal, pending cases and status of ex-gratia payment.
 
 Addressing a meeting of the state level vigilance and monitoring committee constituted under the Act, the CM asked the principal secretary (home) Amir Subhani to call a meeting of DGP, IG (weaker section) of the crime investigation department and the director (prosecution) to review pending   cases. Nitish asked Subhani to discuss the matter with law department and director (prosecution) and issue an advisory to officials concerned to increase conviction rate in the cases registered under SC/ST Act.
