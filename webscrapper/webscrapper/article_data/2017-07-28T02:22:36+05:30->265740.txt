MUMBAI: Many   and their   who tried to meet education minister Vinod   and chief minister   to demand action against schools flouting fee regulation norms at Mantralaya were taken in police   to  , where protests are held, on Thursday. 

 Among the group were parents from a Navi Mumbai school who have been fighting illegal fee hikes for over two years. “We wanted to submit our request to the higher authorities as we have been fighting illegal fee collection for years but there has been no action by education officials. Five parents met Tawde and he assured us a five-member committee will be set up,” said a parent.
 
 Also present were parents from Shardashram Vidyamandir, Dadar, where the management and authorities had a stand-off over a fee hike. 
 
 Parents were upset as not all of them could meet the minister and raised concern over the taking of students in   vans. “They were standing in queues to enter Mantralaya. Police cannot put young children in vans. This is harassment and we will take it up with the government,” said Anubha Sahai of Indiawide Parents’ Association. 
 
 DCP Manoj Sharma said they were only taken to Azad Maidan.
