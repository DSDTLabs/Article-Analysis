Tirupur: About  ,800 shops and commercial establishments remained closed in Avinashi on Thursday in response to a bandh called to protest against the hike in bus fares by the state government. 

 “Middle class and poor people are affected by the hike badly. They now have to spend 50% more than what they spent earlier,” said a social worker and one of the organisers. It used to cost only Rs 19 to travel from Avinashi to Coimbatore, but it has doubled now, he added.
 
 The organisers said they were clear that the opposition parties should not get credit for the bandh. The main opposition party like DMK was not bothered about the issue, said a trader.
 
 “Since Avinashi is the constituency of assembly speaker P Dhanpal, we hope that the bandh observed by all trade bodies here will drwa the government’s attention. So, we silently organised the bandh and we did not mention any names of the organisers in the pamphlets which were distributed to the traders. Otherwise, many people might have tried to thwart the effort,” said the trader.
 
 “The bandh was successfully observed with the cooperation of all shops including grocery and fruits shops. It was not easy for them to shut the shops as they have perishable goods. All the shops remained closed till 6pm,” he added.
