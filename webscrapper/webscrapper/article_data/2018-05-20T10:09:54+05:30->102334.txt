NAGPUR: The high-profile clash between   and   was the talking point on the fourth day of the Khasdar Krida Mahotsav   tournament here at the Subhedar Hall.

 
 Whenever the two talented girls face each other, spectators always get their moneyâ€™s worth. And Saturday was no different. Top seed Malvika overcame the stiff challenge from second seed Ritika 23-21, 21-13 to bag the all-important U-19 girls singles crown.
 
 Nabeel Ahmad emerged as the surprise packet as he clinched his maiden district title. In a nail-biting U-19 boys singles summit clash, Nabeel shocked second seed Makrand Nimbalkar 21-15, 11-21, 23-21.
 
 Earlier in the morning session, Malvika thumped third seed Pavitra Somani 21-15, 21-8, while Ritika prevailed over Anjali Kshirsagar 21-16, 21-16 in the U-19 girls singles semifinals.
 
 The new pair of Rashi Lambe and Ritika Thaker lived up to their top billing and reputation to claim the U-19 girls doubles title. In a final which failed to rise to great heights, Rashi and Ritika made the light work of another new combine of Anjali Kshirsagar and   21-10, 21-7.
 
 However, the match of the morning session was undoubtedly between Nabeel Ahmad and Sudhanshu Bhure. Third seed Nabeel perhaps recorded the biggest win of his career so far when he stunned top seed and former state champion Sudhanshu Bhure in a pulsating encounter. The match witnessed some exciting rallies and powerful smashes from both the players and kept the crowd on the edge of their seats.
 
 The tall and lanky Nabeel will now take on second seed Makrand Nimbalkar, who quelled the challenge of fourth seed Om Ghode 21-16, 21-18 in the second semis.
