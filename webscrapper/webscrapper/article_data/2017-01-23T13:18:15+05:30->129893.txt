 Nearly 500 police personnel were deployed at the two mandals to control over the crowd, but they were out numbered by the protesters.
 
 The protesters, including women, children, youth and senior citizens, gathered at the construction site to condemn the government’s failure to release their compensation and implement the new relief and rehabilitation packages for the displaced persons.

 According to sources, the project began in 2006 at an estimated cost of Rs 930 crore to store nearly 9 TMC of water collected from Vamsadhara river. Nearly 6,000 acres of agriculture land belonging to around 10,000 farmers of the 29 villages were taken by the government against a compensation of Rs 1.5 lakh for each acre. But so far, no compensation has been given, sources added.
 
 Moreover, during a recent visit, irrigation minister Devineni Uma Maheswara Rao told the concerned officials to complete the project by June this year at any cost. Following this, local minister K Atchennaidu told the officials to adhere to the deadline and take help from the police if any displaced person tries to obstruct the project, sources said.
 
 When contacted, Srikakulam collector P Lakshmi Narasimham said, “I have called the local field officers for a meeting to inquire about the project works. I can’t comment anything on it without analysing the incident thoroughly.”
