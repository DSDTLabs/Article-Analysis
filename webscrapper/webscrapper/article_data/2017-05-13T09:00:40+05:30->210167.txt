BENAGALURU: The relatives of two MLAs are locked in a tough contest for the state   president's post. Polling will begin on May 14. 

  It's virtually a battle between north Karnataka and south Karnataka. Sindhanur MLA Hampannagouda Badarli's nephew   (bottom left) is pitted against Madhu giri (Tumakuru district) MLA K N Rajanna's son K N Rajendra. Another candidate M Amruthraj is said to be backed by a minister representing Bengaluru constituency; K Kemparaj is also in the fray. 
 
  Pol ling will be held to all posts from May 14 to 16; counting of votes is scheduled for May 18. The results for the president's post will be announced on May 20. Caste equations and the clout they wield are among the factors which will seal the candidates' fate. There are apprehensions of the polls being rigged, with complaints having been made to the election commissioner appointed to oversee the process. 
 
 Congress MLC  's tenure as the Youth   president for six years has concluded. The new chief will have a three-year term. According to party sources, the move to get the president elected unopposed did not work as chief minister Siddaramaiah was not in favour of the same. "Let the boys have a friendly fight," he is reported to have said.
 
  Badarli, a Lingayat, is being backed by Arshad, while Rajendra, a scheduled tribe, is being tacitly supported by some senior ministers. Amrutraj and Kemparaj are both Vokkaligas. For th e post of the Bengaluru unit president, it's a triangular fight between transport minster Ramalinga Reddy's daughter,  , P Vishwanath and Rakshit Shivaram.
