 During the fourth tree counting held in 2017 by forest department in non-forest areas of the state, increase in number of trees and tree density in south Gujarat was found to be highest among all the four zones of Gujarat.
 
 South Gujarat is the only zone where fruit trees contribute a large percentage in tree population. In Surat district, there are 49.78 per cent of timber trees that contribute to total count of 138.90 lakh trees. Fruit trees contribute to 30.33 per cent of the total count of trees. Against this in the Dang, fruit trees contribute to 10.93 per cent of the total count of 39.75 lakh trees, while timber trees make up 65.86 per cent.
 
 Valsad is the only district in south Gujarat where fruit trees outnumber timber trees. In Valsad, out of total of 128.99 lakh trees, 41.37 per cent are timber trees and 42.23 per cent fruit trees. In Valsad, 29.53 per cent of trees are mango trees whereas in Surat it is 16.17 per cent, Dang 4.46 per cent, Tapi 11.21 per cent and Navsari 23.22 per cent. The major reason behind increase in tree population during the past four years is tree plantation schemes of social forestry department and incentives given to people for planting trees. 
 
 Deputy conservator of forest, Surat, Puneet Nayyar told TOI, “Increase in tree density in Surat district can be attributed to quality plantation work done by forest department outside the forest area.”
