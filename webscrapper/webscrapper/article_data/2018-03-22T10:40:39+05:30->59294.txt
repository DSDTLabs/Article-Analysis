KOCHI:   needs to address man-made droughts by urgently embracing a water management plan, which will include simple remedies like rainwater harvesting, said experts.

 “There’s a change in the rainfall pattern over the year. Earlier, we had heavy rains in June-July, but now we are seeing more rains in August-September. In fact, the concept of Kerala monsoon, which is identified with the rainy months of June-July, is almost not visible. While there is not much difference in the amount of rainfall, the distribution does affect and hence it is important to collect the water and ensure that it trickles down to the soil,” said C K Rajan, climate scientist.
 
 He said that whatever way the rainwater is discharged into the ground will increase the sub-soil water level. “The way groundwater is being exploited is beyond comprehension because highpowered motors are being used to pump water even from groundwater sources. “While it takes several years for a proper recharge and increase in level will not happen at the same pace as it is being exploited,” he said.
 
 Though there is a rule that any building of more than 100 sq m should have a rainwater harvesting facility, it is being done in namesake manner for availing noobjection certificates, said C M Joy, environmentalist. More than 80% of the flats don’t have an efficient rainwater harvesting system. “In many of the flats they don’t function in reality. On paper, it is there, of course,” he said.
 
 “Apartments, which have realised that there is a major problem, are using it properly. But a good number of them aren’t and then they reel under severe water shortage,” said  , president, Apartment Owners’ Apex Association.
