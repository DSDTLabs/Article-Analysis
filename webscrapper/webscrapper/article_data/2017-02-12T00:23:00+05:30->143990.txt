Bhopal: Some of the best university cricketers will be in Bhopal this Sunday, chasing the country’s second oldest cricket   — only there is no cup to chase for.

 The running trophy of Rohinton Baria cup interuniversity cricket tournament, second only to Ranji, has gone missing. No one knows where and when. “It will be embarrassing for us during the prize distribution if the winners ask for the running trophy. I have written to the Association of Indian Universities regarding this,” said Barkatullah University’s director-sports Akhilesh Sharma. AIU organises this annual tournament.
 
 The trophy was donated by Ardeshir Dadabhoy Baria of Bombay in memory of his son Rohinton in 1935 for a tournament to be played among Indian universities. Initially, BCCI organised the tournament, but the interuniversity sports board of India (IUSB) took over in 1940-41. 
 
 BU last organised it in 2001-02. “I can recall that the trophy was sent by train from Kolkata. It was a heavy gold plated trophy, made of brass. I have spoken to the winner of last year’s tournament, but they told us that the trophy was not given to them by the hosts,” said Sharma.
 
 Director-sports, SRM University, Chennai, K Vaithianathan told TOI that last year’s hosts, Saveetha University in Chennai, did not given them the trophy. “I asked them, but they said they were unaware about it,” said Vaithianathan. The authorities of Saveetha University gave the same reply. AIU officials said they are trying to trace the trophy. “Let me talk to the universities. Ideally, the trophy should have been with the winner of the last year’s tournament,” said AIU secretary Gurdeep Singh. Trophy or not, the tournament will be hosted by BU according to schedule, he added. “We will send a new trophy in case the original isn’t found,” said Singh.
