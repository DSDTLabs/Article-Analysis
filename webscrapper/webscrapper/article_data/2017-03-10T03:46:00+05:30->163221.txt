Panaji: Goa Forward Party (GFP) will be equidistant between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress, said party’s mentor  , adding that his party was not in a hurry to come to power.

 He told TOI that the possibilities that might emerge after the March 11 results were discussed at the party’s meeting on Friday.
 
 Asked who will GFP support in case there is a hung assembly, Sardesai said, “Let’s cross the bridge when we come to it. Let the results be declared and then we’ll decide.”
 
 “Let the parties come with proposals to us considering that there will be no clear majority. We’ll examine the proposal but will push our agenda for Goem and Goemkarponn. We will never go back on this,” Sardesai assured.
 
 If GFP becomes part of any dispensation, there will be a common minimum programme enlisting our demands on preserving Goenkarponn, he said. To a query, he agreed that both the BJP and the Congress have betrayed the cause of Goa over the years.
 
 “If they don’t agree to our demands, we’ll not be part of such dispensation. We are not in any haste to come to power”, Sardesai said.
 
 In a controversial statement, he said that if the party they align with did not stand by their word on Goemkarponn, then they would not hesitate to destabilize the ruling party.
 
 On the exit polls, Sardesai said that the results were far from reality. “The ground reality is different. There were many factors that determined the results. There was also the silent voter factor,” he said, adding that BJP would not be close to getting the magic figure of 21 seats.
 
 Asked which party according to him will emerge as the sigle largest party, Sardesai said it could be the Congress. “But that doesn’t mean our support is automatic,” he added.
