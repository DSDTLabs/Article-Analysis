 Potharaj’s parents were construction labourers and he too had worked as a coolie when he was a student. “It’s an inhumane act by police, who were supposed to arrange an ambulance or body carrier. But they used a garbage van. We condemn it and will hold a protest soon,” said Ningappa Chavadi, president of the Haveri district unit of  . Potharaj’s uncle, Nagaraj, said, “When we objected to police carrying Mounesh’s body in a garbage vehicle, they didn’t listen to us. They shouldn’t use such vehicles to shift bodies,” he said.
 
 Haveri SP K Parashuram said the police had tried to get a private vehicle to carry the body but nothing was available due to the festival rush. “No vehicle is provided to us to shift bodies. Even ambulance won’t carry bodies. So we have been shifting bodies using locally available vehicles,” Parshuram said. “We usually get vehicles from local authorities, but this time we did not get any. We didn’t intend to hurt anyone,” he said.
