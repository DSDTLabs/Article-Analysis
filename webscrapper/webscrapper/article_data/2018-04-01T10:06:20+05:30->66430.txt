BENGALURU: A woman contesting her   cannot make his second wife and their son parties to the dispute, the   has said.

 A matrimonial dispute under the Hindu Marriages Act is between a husband and his wife and the list of parties cannot be expanded unlike other civil disputes, Justice Vineet   said. He dismissed a petition filed by Chithravati (name changed) of Channarayapatna, Hassan district.
 
 “The concept of necessary and proper parties, under order 1 rule 10 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code, cannot be widely construed to be applied to such a matrimonial dispute between the two parties. It is not a civil suit in the nature of a property dispute, which is being decided by the court. It has to decide the fate of a Hindu marriage, whether it is to be dissolved under section 13 of the Act or not,” Justice Kothari observed.
 
 The high court noted that Chithravati had already initiated legal proceedings by filing a suit for declaring her husband’s second marriage as illegal, and the same will take care of her interest.
 
 The petitioner had challenged the June 22, 2016 order passed by the family court, Hassan, which dismissed her application to implead Padmavati (name changed), the second wife of her husband Swamy (name changed) and the son born from the second marriage. The divorce petition was filed by Swamy.
 
 “In a divorce petition filed under section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, the lis is essentially only between two parties, the husband and his wife. The specified grounds on which the divorce can be obtained under section 13 have to be established by the applicant or the petitioner who files the divorce petition,” the judge said.
