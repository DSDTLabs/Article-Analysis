KOLHAPUR: The model code of conduct has come into effect in the city after dates for   elections were declared. If anyone is found violating the model code, strict action will be taken against them, said district collector Amit Saini.

 He also asked the concerned government officials to act on every complaint raised regarding the violation of the code of the conduct and take appropriate action with immediate effect.
 
 Saini spoke about the code’s strict enforcement on Wednesday when he convened a meeting of the steering committee at the district collectorate and guided the members regarding the implementation of the model code of conduct. He asked all members to strictly follow the guidelines set by the election commission. 
 
 “All the returning officers who are in-charge of the talukas, must work with a video surveillance team, static surveillance team, flying squads, squads deployed to survey check posts and ensure that all these individual teams are functioning properly. They should ensure that boards, banners, hoardings depicting advertisements of the candidates are removed from their respective jurisdictions,” said Saini.
 
 All the political rallies, meetings, marches and other political activities should be recorded on camera to ensure the model code of conduct is not being violated, he said.
 
 The district administration has set up a helpline 0231-2651950 for queries and complaints by people as well as candidates regarding the election process and the model code of conduct. 
 
 To spread awareness among the voters, the district administration will organise a voter awareness rally on January 25. Students from various colleges in the district, NCC and NSS students will participate in the rally.
