BHUBANESWAR: Struggling to overcome intra-party schism, Congress on Sunday hinted that it would not rope in any high profile leaders for the task of ‘star campaigners’ in the ensuing   next month. The opposition party also flayed BJP’s decision to make heavyweight leaders, including Chhattisgarh chief minister   as star campaigners of the saffron party. 

 “Our candidates are our assets. They themselves will be Congress star campaigners. Selection of candidates for 851 Zila Parishad zones has been finalized,” Congress state president   said.
 
 Making a veiled attack on BJP’s star campaigners, Harichandan said those parties that hire leaders from outside lack confidence. “It seems those parties lack good leaders or campaigners in Odisha. That is the reason why they are dependent on star campaigners from other states,” Harichandan said. 
 
 While he refrained from commenting on infighting within Congress, recently he asserted that the party is united. But frequent war of words between different leaders only lent credence to the growing public perception that all is not well within the main opposition party. 
 
 Harichandan and leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra recently hogged attention for their reported differences on party matters. Distance between Harichandan and Mishra surfaced in August last year. Absence of Harichandan in an all-party meeting convened by Mishra on Mahanadi water issue on August 3, 2016 did not go down well with many. The schism escalated when a delegation of Congress MLAs led by Mishra met Rahul in Delhi on October 15, 2016 and reportedly expressed their displeasure over Harichandan’s performance. It was evident after party’s Jeypore MLA Taraprasad Bahinipati went on record several times in media, slamming Harichandan. Some party leaders were earlier vocal against AICC general secretary in-charge of Odisha B K Hariprasad. Hariprasad was booed and abused by a group of Student Congress leaders in a hotel here.
