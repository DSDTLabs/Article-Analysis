GANDHINAGAR: After maintaining a studied silence till the last day of filing  ,   announced names of former minister of state (MOS) railway and senior tribal leader Naran Rathwa and party spokesperson and senior Gujarat high court lawyer and women rights activist Ami Yagnik as its candidates from Ahmedabad.

 Rathwa had lost the Lok Sabha elections from Chota Udepur seat in 2014 elections. Yagnik has never contested any elections. More than two dozen leaders had expressed their desire to get RS nominations. 
 
 Rathwa, who has significant command in the central Gujarat region, has been given a ticket considering the party’s tribal vote bank. Yagnik has been chosen as the women representative and for her ability to speak against BJP in national media. Yagnik regularly appears on national TV channel debates and is considered close to Rahul Gandhi. However, she is yet not a figure in vote bank politics. It was expected that Congress may nominate a Patidar, OBC or scheduled caste leader for the Rajya Sabha seat. However, the party preferred to induct a professionally qualified person instead of a caste-based leader. 
 
 Yagnik, when contacted, said, “I am happy and thankful to the party for this new responsibility.”
