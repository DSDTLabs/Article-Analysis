CHENNAI:   in   is stagnated on the   near the   for weeks due to a sewer line leak. 

 Shopkeepers on the foul-smelling 50m stretch are complaining that the stagnation along the sidewalk is keeping customers away. At peak hours, pedestrians and commuters on two-wheelers are forced to put their feet into the filth.
 
 The leak is from Metrowater's sewer main line, a 300mm (1 feet)-diameter pipeline that conveys sewage from homes in south Mylapore to the Adyar sewage pumping station through the force of gravity. The pipeline slops along the its network to reach the pumping station which uses electric motors to pump the sewage to the treatment plant at Perungudi. Secondary treated sewage from the Perungudi STP is emptied into the Buckingham Canal which drains into the Bay of Bengal through the Muttukadu lake along East Coast Road.
 
 A Metrowater official said, "It does not appear to be a serious problem. The leakage will be plugged by Monday."
 
 A hawker at intersection of RK Mutt Road and Canal Bank Road said, on condition of anonymity, "A government official and two labourers inspected the leak a fortnight ago but went back without fixing it." Ahead of the north east monsoon which is set to commence in October, officials are yet to attend to sewer line leaks at several busy spots in the city. 
 
 Arterial roads such as White's Road, near Government Hobart School for Girls, and the General Patters Road, near Express Avenue mall, saw stagnation due to overflowing sewage for months.
