NEW DELHI: The Centre will hold a tripartite dialogue with rebel Naga group   (UNC) and Manipur government brass here on Friday to explore ways to end the nearly three-month-old economic blockade of NH-2 in Manipur. 

 The blockade, which has hit the movement of trucks and cut off supply of essentials like petrol and diesel to Manipur, is being enforced by UNC to protest the state government’s ‘unilateral’ decision to carve new districts out of hill areas, many of which are dominated by Nagas. 
 
 Government sources told TOI that both UNC and Manipur government brass have confirmed that they will be attending the tripartite meeting, to be chaired by joint secretary (north-east) in the home ministry Satyendra Garg. The meeting will hear UNC’s grievances against the Manipur government’s move and seek their resolution by the state government, with the Centre playing the role of a facilitator. 
 
 UNC president Gaidon Kamei and information secretary Shangkhan Stephen, who are both under judicial custody, were flown to New Delhi under security cover on Thursday to join Friday’s tripartite meeting. Though a similar tripartite meeting was convened on November 15 last year and UNC representatives had volunteered to attend, the Manipur government brass chose to stay away. The Centre had subsequently faulted the state government for avoiding the meeting and accused chief minister Okram   of bringing hardship to the people of Manipur for his narrow political gains. 
 
 Ibobi Singh is counting on his poll-eve move to create new districts to boost his chances of returning to power. Alternatively, his act has the BJP worried about its own electoral prospects. The UNC-sponsored economic blockade on the state’s national highways entered its 93rd day on Thursday.
