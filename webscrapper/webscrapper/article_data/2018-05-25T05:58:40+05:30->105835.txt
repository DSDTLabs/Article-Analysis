CHANDIGARH: Hot weather conditions in the city continue to make life miserable for residents. According to weathermen, heatwave will continue till Sunday. Following the forecast, some private schools in Chandigarh have called for summer vacation in advance, which was going to begin next week.

 On Thursday, the maximum temperature in Chandigarh was recorded at 41.8°C, 4 degrees above normal and minimum temperature was touched 25.6°C, 2 degrees above normal. The day temperature was lower than Wednesday’s 42.6°C, 5 degrees above normal, but that brought no respite to residents.
 
 The parents of students studying in government and private schools that will close only by the end of the month also wished for early vacation and so did the teachers.
 
 Arvind Rana, a government school teacher, said, “While the rooms of school heads and of officials of education department are pleasantly cool, with the heatwave on and temperature touching 43°C, the classrooms of government schools are unbearably hot as slow-speed fans fail to cool down a class full of 40 to 70 students. Some schools are even holding 30-minute morning assemblies which should be stopped.”
 
 “The convents and so many other schools are already closed. All schools in Delhi closed on May 19. I wonder why schools in Chandigarh are still open despite the scorching weather,” said Archana Pandit, a parent.
 
 In the next two days, the temperature is expected to shoot up to 44°C, the weathermen said. Though after crossing 43°C on Tuesday, the day temperature on Wednesday dropped by a few notches. However, it did not bring any respite from the scorching heat.
 
 According to Chandigarh   department, the sky is expected to remain clear with heat wave continuing all day long. For Friday, the weathermen have given a forecast of mainly clear sky with maximum temperature expected to be around 43°C. The minimum temperature will be 26°C.
