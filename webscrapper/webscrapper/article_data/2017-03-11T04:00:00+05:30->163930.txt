Mumbai: In a bid to boost its struggling passenger vehicle business,   has struck an alliance with German auto giant   to jointly develop a new range of products. These models will hit the road in 2019. This is Tata Motors’ second partnership after  , with whom it has a joint venture for manufacturing cars, engines and transmissions. 

 Currently, Tata Motors’ alliance with Volkswagen is for passenger vehicles but it could be broadened to include commercial vehicles. In the past, Tata Motors had a tie-up with Daimler through which it had rolled out its first batch of trucks with the Benz logo in 1954. 
 
 Talks with Volkswagen were initiated by former Tata Motors chairman   a year ago and the partnership, signed on Friday, will cover developing new-age mobility models and vehicle components for India and beyond. The alliance comes as Tata Motors tries to reverse its fortunes in the domestic business by reducing the number of car platforms from six to two, streamlining the organisational structure and adapting to market trends quickly. Losses at the company’s stand-alone business widened from Rs 460 crore to Rs 1,651 crore in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. 
 
 “This is in alignment with Tata Motors’ efforts to make itself ‘FutuReady’,” said the company’s MD Guenter Butschek. He had confirmed this impending collaboration in an interview to TOI a few days ago.
 
 Teaming up with Tata Motors will also help Volkswagen to plug the budget model gap in its product portfolio and improve its presence in India and other fast-growing automobile markets after its earlier arrangement with Suzuki Motor collapsed in 2015. 
 
 The alliance will be led by Volkswagen’s   unit and it will develop vehicle concepts in the economy segment, said the German automotive giant. This indicates that Skoda will look at the lower end of the market, targeting mass customers.
