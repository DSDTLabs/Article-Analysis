BENGALURU: Armed with a search warrant it obtained on Wednesday night, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) might raid the houses of friends and relatives of Congress leader   in connection with the   notes case, agency sources said. 

 
 One bank manager, who was held in the demonetisation currency case, has said that he did it at the behest of senior Congress leader DK Suresh. The CBI has obtained search warrant against Suresh and 11 others. 
 
 It is yet to be ascertained whether the Shivakumar is one among those 11. 
 
 DK Suresh, who got the information on Wednesday night, held a press meet on Thursday morning alleging that it was a conspiracy against him for helping his brother to prevent the Bharatiya Janata Party from coming to power. 
 
 While CBI sources from Delhi were yet to confirm about the raid, sources close to DK Suresh said that the raid had begun, but they were yet to search the house of Suresh.
 
 
 
 
 At the press meet, DK Shivakumar and his brother Bangalore Rural MP DK Suresh deplored the political move by BJP government for "letting loose" the CBI/IT/ED against them to lure them to support the BJP.
 
 The leaders alleged that they were under "constant pressure from the BJP sources" since the days Gujarat legislators landed in Bangalore last year to support the BJP. "But the BJP is making every effort to lure us towards them," the Congress leaders said.
 
  
  
 
 
 As regards search warrants, DK Suresh asserted his name and that of his brother were included afresh after the BJP government failed to prove majority in the Karnataka assembly. It was evident that BJP has to accept the defeat as DK Shivakumar played a prominet role in keeping the Congress and JD(S) legislators together.
 
 The brothers expressed confidence they would withstand all the "machinations and temptations" and would remain loyal to the Congress party.
