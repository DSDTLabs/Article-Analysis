Panaji: The Church has clarified that none of its monuments would come under the ‘adopt a heritage’ scheme unless an NOC is granted after due consideration.

 Fr Valeriano Vaz and Fr J Loiola Pereira, who attended the meeting chaired by minister for archives Vijai Sardesai, on the central government scheme, in the secretariat, on Monday, have issued a clarification “in view of some malicious and defamatory statements doing the rounds in the social media with regard to the participation of the Church in the ‘adopt a heritage’ scheme”.
 
 “It was agreed that the archdiocese, as the owner of the monuments, would draw up an NOC listing all the conditions/restrictions/safeguards that it might deem fit in each case. No intervention at the selected church sites would be allowed without the consent of the diocesan authority, which would draw up this NOC after due consultation at various levels,” the statement reads.
