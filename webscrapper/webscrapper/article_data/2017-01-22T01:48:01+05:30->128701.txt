GURGAON: Surplus power with   is likely to come as a windfall for industries in  . This is because electricity consumption during off-peak hours is going to become cheaper for those industrial consumers who draw power from high tension (HT) lines.

 The   has decided to introduce a concessional tariff plan on pilot basis for HT industrial consumers during off-peak hours (10pm to 4am). A concessional rate of Rs 6 per unit will be applicable for power consumed between 10pm and 4am.
 
 In Gurgaon, most of the discom’s high-tension industrial customers comprise of manufacturing factories. “All industrial consumers who have high-tension connections can avail of this scheme. This will not only increase efficiency of their industrial units, but also help DHBVN use its surplus power,” a senior discom official told TOI.
 
 The tariff plan, though, is applicable only for the number of units consumed more than those during the corresponding billing period of the preceding year. “If a unit consumed, say, 35,06,578 units of power in December 2016, and the consumption during the corresponding month of the previous year was 26,58,844 units, the excess consumption will qualify to be billed at the concessional tariff of Rs 6 per unit,” the official said.
 
 “For new connections that have not yet completed a year, their consumption for the preceding month will be considered for the concessional tariff,” he added.
 
 The new tariff plans will be applicable till March 31.
