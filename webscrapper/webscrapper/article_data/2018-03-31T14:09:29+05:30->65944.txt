NEW DELHI: England batsman   has been confirmed as the replacement for   in   for the 11th season of the IPL starting April 7. Warner had earlier this week stepped down as captain of Sunrisers following the ball-tampering controversy that broke last Saturday in Cape Town, and then had his IPL contract torn up once Cricket Australia suspended him for 12 months. 

 
 
 
 A BCCI press release today confirmed that Hales, 29, has been purchased by SRH for his base price of Rs 1 crore having been overlooked during the player auction in January. This will be Hales’ second stint with an IPL franchise, having earlier been part of Mumbai Indians’ squad. Hales has never actually played in an IPL match, however. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 His T20 franchise career has seen Hales play for Adelaide Strikers, Hobart Hurricanes and Melbourne Renegades in Australia’s Big Bash League, for Islamabad United in the Pakistan Super League and for his county, Nottinghamshire. He is the only England batsman to have scored a century in Twenty20 internationals. 
 
 Warner, 31, was the leading run-getter for SRH in the 2017 IPL and guided them to the title in 2016. For his leading role in the ball-tampering controversy during the recent third Test between Australia and South Africa, Warner has been suspended for one year and stripped of ever holding a leadership role within the Australian team. The CA investigation found that Warner was guilty of giving advice to a junior player on how to tamper with the ball "including demonstrating how it could be done” and for misleading the Newlands match officials by concealing his knowledge of and involvement in the plan and did not voluntarily report his involvement.
