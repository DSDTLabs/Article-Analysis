VADODARA: The  , it seems, has picked up the cue from   initiative of Prime minister  . 

 A major initiative to clear all paper files and documents from   has been taken up by the police department over last few weeks. The cops are cleaning up several rooms in the spacious building to ensure a good working environ for the staff. 
 
 “Many rooms were filled up with very old files and documents. We are removing all the unnecessary documents and organizing the important ones. The idea is to ensure that the staff has a clean workplace so that it motivates them work more productively,” said city police commissioner, Manoj Sashidhar. All the documents in the modus operandi branch (MOB) on the fifth floor is being computerized. “Cupboards full of records are being emptied and every document is being made digital. The room too will be refurbished,” Sashidhar told TOI.
 
 The police said that even the registry branch won’t have too many paper documents and it will save lot of government funds. The Police Bhavan has undergone major changes and most of the rooms are being given a corporate look. 
 
 The central surveillance room on the first floor sports automatic doors that can be opened only by the staffers. 
 
 All the feeds from the CCTVs installed under different police stations are watched from this room and even the data is centrally stored. The police department has already drawn plans to modernize the control room. 
 
 A new system resembling the 911 emergency service in the USA is being installed by the police to ensure that none of the calls get dropped. 
 
 If one landline phone is engaged, the system will dispatch the call to any of the 20 work stations and the call will be answered within seconds. A display screen will also flash caller’s number so that if a call gets dropped due to any reason, the cop on duty can call back.
