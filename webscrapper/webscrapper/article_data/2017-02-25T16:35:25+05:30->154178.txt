MUMBAI: Private hospitals in Mumbai have begun setting up satellite centres across the city to offer cancer care closer to patients' homes.

 While south Mumbai’s   recently inaugurated a centre in Thane in northeastern suburbs, central Mumbai’s   too opened its first such centre in Borivli in northwestern suburbs.
 
 The idea of taking cancer care closer to the patients has been the buzzword in the healthcare sector in recent times. In fact, doctors of  , the government-run premier cancer centre in central Mumbai that gets 1,000 patients a day, have for long talked about the need to decongest cancer-care. The idea is to develop cancer care across the country in such a manner that patients – and their families -- don’t have to travel thousands of kilometers for care.
 
 Tata Memorial Hospital already has affiliate hospitals in a handful of states and has begun training doctors in public hospitals on the nuances of  . There also is the National Cancer Grid, which has 95 hospitals and medical schools as members, to ensure uniform cancer care protocols across the country.
 
 Now, the private hospitals are taking the idea to neighbourhoods. A press release sent by Asian Oncology Centre said, "In any type ofcancer, approximately 50% patients need chemotherapy at least once in their lifetime. Regular chemotherapy for a general patient lasts at least for six sessions. For each of this chemotherapy, the patient has to travel all the way to hospitals. Accessibility to quality cancer care is a challenge in our country and our smart cancer centres intend to address this issue."
 
 Although citizens have to face traffic woes and travel huge distances to reach cancer hubs in the city, it remains to be seen if the satellite model will click in the long run.
