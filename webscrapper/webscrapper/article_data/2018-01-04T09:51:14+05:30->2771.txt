MUMBAI: Swami   (Kandivli) is set to launch a protest after their opponents - Rizvi Springfield- were given a walkover on Day 2 of their Giles Shield semifinal match on Wednesday.

  (MSSA) decided that the tournament would go on as scheduled despite the 'Maharashtra Bandh' on Wednesday. While   (Matunga),
 
 IES Sule Guruji (Eng) and   (Bandra) showed up with all their players, there was no sign of any Swami Vivekanand players. Umpires waited till 11.50 am before declaring the match in Rizvi Springfield's favour.  , coach of the Kandivli team told TOI that the decision was unfair to them.
 
 "The situation was very bad. How can we put our children at risk? The boys did reach school at 6.30 am, but there were no school buses to take us to the venue in South Mumbai. Our school management decided that safety was more important for the children than a cricket match. The MSSA should have understood that. While people were advised to stay at home, they wanted children to come all the way from Kandivli," Lad said.
 
 MSSA cricket secretary  , though, said that all the schools were informed on Tuesday itself that the games would go on as scheduled. "We even told the school to send the children by cabs and we would foot the bill. All the kids from the other three teams made it to the ground. We cannot give concessions to any team," Memon said. In the other semifinal, Don Bosco beat IES Sule Guruji by virtue of the first innings lead. On resumption of play on the second day, IES Sule Guruji declared its innings at 289/3, thinking that the score would be enough but  's sturdy 175-ball 135 gave Don Bosco the win.
 
 
 IES Sule Guruji 289/3 dec in 84.5 overs (Yash Rajan 104*) lost to Don Bosco HS 300/6 dec (63 overs) Sahil Jadhav 135,   71).
