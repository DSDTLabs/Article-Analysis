PANAJI: The BJP’s decision to ask its MPs to go on a day-long token hunger strike was an admission of defeat and proof that the party which has a majority in Parliament was unable to govern and implement people-friendly policies,   said here on Thursday.

 The  , which has 274 members in  , asked its MPs, including Vinay Tendulkar, Shripad Naik and Narendra Sawaikar, to go on a day-long hunger strike to protest against attempts by the opposition to stall Parliamentary proceedings.
 
 “Theidea of threeBJPMPs going on a hunger strike in Goa sounds like a pretty good joke,” Goa Pradesh Mahila Congress president   said. “This may be the first time in Indian political history that ruling MPs are sitting on a hunger strike. This is an admission of defeat.”
 
 Even as the three BJP MPs representing Goa protested at Azad Maidan, Congress questioned the motive behind the protest. “The reasons for the hunger strike are just dirty gimmicks. What exactly have they done for Goans in Parliament? How many questions have they asked?”   said.
 
 The previous day state Congress president Shantaram Naik had blamed BJP for stalling Parliament proceedings.
 
 “Prime Minister   cannot face Parliament,”  . “Hecan give good speeches but to answer the opposition benches in Parliament, to give a point by point response to criticism from the Congress, he cannot do that. That is why he does not allow the Parliament to function.”
