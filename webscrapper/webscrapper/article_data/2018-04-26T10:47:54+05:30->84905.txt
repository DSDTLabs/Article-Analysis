M  , 32, of Sowripalayam, was taken into custody based on a complaint lodged by the cash replenishment company. The fraud came to light while setting accounts at the end of the financial year, when banks noticed anomalies in the amount handled in the ATMs and the amount dispensed from their currency chest, said an officer. After several banks submitted reports, the company conducted an internal inquiry and found that the money went missing only from the ATMs handled by Suresh Kumar.
