Usually, a   involves friends and relatives  ,   and a few compliments. But a   of Dakshina Kannada district decided to look beyond the norms to make this  

 Deviprasad, a PU Commerce Lecturer, explains how he did that. “While we did not accept any gifts, we contributed towards funds to the Army Welfare Fund Battle Casualties. We also made it public so that people could get to know about it,” he said.
 
 He reveals the emotion behind the step too. “It was a special day in our lives. Everyone dreams of building a house but we are safe in our house because our soldiers are guarding the nation. This was our token of respect to the nation’s heroes and their families,” he said.
 
 It was an informal function with a few people addressing the gathering about the importance of this fund. The family collected about Rs 5,600. Interestingly, those present there were so impressed by the move, that they started contributing.
 
 They collected about Rs 2,000 from the people who had gathered there. Many present grieved that they could not contribute more as they were not prepared for it. The house warming ceremony ended with an awareness programme.
 
 Deviprasad said, “We will not stop here. I have already placed a box in my house and I have been contributing Rs 1 everyday.”
 
 “We hope to launch a campaign so that every house has a box and people contribute whatever they can to help the cause. We plan to send this money once a year. The awareness drive will soon be launched and a team of friends are working on it,” he said.
 
 The house warming ceremony was celebrated on May 1. The house ‘Athiti Nilaya is located at Madenjimaar in Halenerenki of Puttur Taluk in Dakshina Kannada district. The house is located about 27 kilometers from Puttur town.
