After campaigning for   in the US Presidential election, actress   headlined what’s said to be the biggest performance at his inaugural welcome celebrations. The event was held at   in Washington DC and the   World 2010 performed to   chartbusters, including 'Kala Chashma', 'Jumme Ki Raat', 'Dhoom Machale' and 'Jai Ho'.

 Speaking to BT from Washington DC, Manasvi, who debuted in B-Town with 'Action Jackson', says, “I’ve never been so nervous performing live; we had been rehearsing for the last 15 days. This event was a culmination of all the efforts we’d taken for the presidential campaign. We’d earlier put together ‘Humanity United Against Terror’, a Bollywood charity event that Trump addressed. This is our way of saying ‘thank you’ to the Indian community. Several industrialists, dignitaries and celebrities, including Mika Singh, attended the event as guests. In fact, this was the first time that a Bollywood performance was part of the US Presidential inauguration.”
 
 
  
 Manasvi adds, “We were part of the inauguration ceremony of the Vice President, and I will also be attending the swearing-in ceremony of the President. I’m happy that we are not just spectators, but an integral part of the administration and ceremonies.”
 
 In an earlier chat with BT, Manasvi had said, “I’ve met Trump on four different occasions in a span of one month, starting with the charity concert, where we got talking. He loves Bollywood; in fact, he calls me Bollywood. I subsequently met him at a private donor lunch in Vegas, at his son Eric Trump’s temple event in Orlando and at a private meet and greet with the Hindu community. We were invited to almost all his private and most elite personal events. The entire Trump family is approachable and genuine.”
