LUCKNOW: Even after 24 hours, the police have failed to make a breakthrough in the   dacoity in which four houses were attacked within 40 minutes on Tuesday. 

 The attacks left one dead and six injured. The police had claimed to have identified a gang belonging to Etah but failed to get any significant results. Even dog squads pressed into service could not provide any direction. 
 
 The police have failed to make any breakthrough even in the six dacoities of Kakori and Chinhat. Arrests were made on January 19 in Chinhat but no booty was recovered. 
 
 Even the anti-dacoity cell formed after two dacoities in   in May has failed to perform as per expectations. Dacoities of Chinhat happened after formation of the cell. 
 
 TOI investigations revealed that the police have no record or data of the gangs involved in the past. Officials said since very few dacoities take place in Lucknow, they had no data on gangs. 
 
 Locals from areas where dacoities have taken place told TOI that beat in charges from rural police usually go back home after 9pm. No combing or patrolling is done in odd hours, they added. 
 
 Forensic laboratory officials said that in absence of database of gangs, they could not match fingerprint and ballistic reports. 
 
 SSP Lucknow   said that police have zeroed-in on tribal gangs active in Etah for dacoities in Lucknow in the past year. 
 
 "For the past few years, a nomadic and barbaric gang has begun to reside in the areas of Tirwa, Etah and Kannauj districts," he said. 
 
 After the loots, the gang members leave for Alwar in   and Ujjain in  , he said. 
 
 A police team has been made to co-ordinate with police in Etah and Kannauj and conduct a joint operation. "We are preparing a database of the gangs," he said.
