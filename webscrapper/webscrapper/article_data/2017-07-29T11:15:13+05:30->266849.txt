CHANDIGARH: A constable can be seen thrashing a minor boy at   in a 45-second video clip that has gone viral, triggering outrage.

 Sources said a youth had brought the boy, around 12 years old, to the police station, accusing him of stealing goods. The youth told the constable that the boy and eight other children had committed several thefts and were active in their area for a long time. Without seeking a reply from the boy, the constable started hurling abuses at him and kicked and punched him, the footage showed. A police official standing next to the constable did not intervene.

 Inspector Ram Rattan, Maloya station house officer, said the two parties had come to the police station in connection with a brawl case on Thursday evening. At the police station, they again fought before the constable. “It was then the constable thrashed him. Both parties were called to strike a compromise. No FIR (first information report) has been filed against anybody. Later, the juvenile was released,” Rattan added. However, the video does not show the two groups fighting in front of the cops.
 
 Harjinder Kaur, chairperson, Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR), said the commission would seek a report from senior police officials regarding the thrashing. “If the cops arrest any juvenile for involvement in any criminal activity, they have to produce him in front of a juvenile justice board and send him to a juvenile home as soon as possible,” she said.
 
 Deepak Yadav, DSP, south division, said an inquiry would be conducted into the matter and strict action taken against the erring cop.
 
 According to Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, police cannot even interrogate a minor in uniform or summon one to police stations.
