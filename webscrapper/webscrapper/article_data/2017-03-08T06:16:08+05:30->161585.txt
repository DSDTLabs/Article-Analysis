PUNE: The   from the RBI has been slowly improving over the past four months after   and so has the currency in circulation, feel bankers. But the   of ATMs are not over yet.

 A lot of ATMs are still running dry frequently. It is difficult to estimate the exact number because the replenished ATMs run out of cash soon after.
 
 “On an average, people are withdrawing more cash than what they did during the pre-demonetisation days,” said a senior banker with one of the public sector banks.
 
 A lot of branch managers have literally coaxed their big value current account customers to deposit their holdings with the branches. It is now helping them in disbursing money to the  .
 
 The RBI has capped the current weekly withdrawal limit at Rs50,000 from savings bank accounts, which would be lifted next week.
 
 Another public sector banker said though the cash availability from the RBI had improved, it was still not the same as it was during the pre-demonetisation days.
 
 The RBI updated the position on the total currency in circulation last on February 8. It said, “Notes in circulation as on January 27, 2017 had been Rs9.92 lakh crore comprising all the denominations, including the Rs2,000 and Rs500 notes.”
 
 When specifically asked about the Rs500 and Rs2,000 notes being brought back into the system since November 8, the RBI governor Urjit Patel said, “No, we do not usually give that information out.”
 
 It can be inferred from the RBI’s previous data that the central bank would have printed and circulated about Rs7 lakh crore of new currency in Rs2,000 and Rs500 denominations till the date it made the data available. The number ought to have improved in the previous month, for which the data is not available.
