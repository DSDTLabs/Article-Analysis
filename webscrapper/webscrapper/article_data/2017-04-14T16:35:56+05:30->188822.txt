GORAKHPUR: After spending more then 14 years in prison for murder, India's oldest prisoner 108-year-old Chauthi Yadav was released from Gorakhpur   on Thursday. 

 Yadav's release came three months after UP governor Ram Naik exercised his constitutional powers and ordered his release, after a request from the former Akhilesh Yadav-led government in 2012. Chauthi Yadav was convicted of murdering a person on July 25, 1979. 
 
 A court had found him guilty in 1982 and he was finally jailed in 2003. Yadav went to his home in   village in   and was accompanied by his nephew Gautam and wife Sunra (96). 
 
 "Due to the enforcement of the model code of conduct during the state assembly elections, his release was delayed by three months. The governor had ordered his release on Januray 12 but we got the order from the district magistrate today," said senior jail suprintendent SK Sharma. 
 
 Yadav said, "I missed my family all these years. Had they not tried for my release I would have died waiting for my release."
