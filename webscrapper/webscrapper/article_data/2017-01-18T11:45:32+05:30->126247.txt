NASHIK: The  , which basks in the glory of  , houses a state-of-the-art   that has not been used in the last nine months.

 Costing the hospital a whopping Rs 2.5 crore, the machine has not been installed yet as the state government was grappling with payment related issues.
 
 “The hospital has been functioning without a CT scan machine for the last four years as the shelf life of the existing machine is over. Since then, there has been no machine at the hospital. All critical tests, like ascertaining the extent of head injuries on a patient, could not be carried out here due to absence of the machine,” a hospital official said.
 
 Ironically, the   recently won the Kayakalp award from the state health department for catering to the needs of the poor patients and ensuring cleanliness and hygiene. The civic hospital caters to over 60 lakh poor patients from across the district.
 
 “The contract of installing a new CT scan machine at all the 23 civil hospitals in the state was given to a private company. Over the next three years, the concerned company could install the machine only at the Pune civil hospital and no other civil hospital,” the official said.
 
 Due to a delay in receiving a new machine, the state government decided to procure a machine on its own. In May, last year, the civil hospital purchased a new CT scan machine.
 
 Dr  , district civil surgeon and in-charge of the Nashik civil hospital, admitted that the CT scan machine could not be commissioned by the concerned company due to payment related issues. 
 
 “The entire issue has been solved and the machine will be operational in a couple of weeks,” Jagdale said.
 
 The new advanced CT scan machine offers a guarantee for the next ten years, making it convenient for the civil hospital to conduct tests even for the stomach and chest.
