What starts with an impassioned reading of an English narrative sets the premise for an equally engaging performance — 
  makes you rethink the notions we nestle in our minds about how a man and a woman should behave when they are together.

  Dancer-theatreperson   opened every sequence of the show with a textual piece, on which Bharatanatyam exponent   elaborated with profuse movements and gestures — giving the audience not just an idea of what unfurls on stage, but also form a perspective of the purpose of the blended art forms. There was a constant endeavour by the artistes to personally connect with the spectators and guests through the readings, music and narrative techniques.
 
  As stimulating as it can get, this carefully crafted piece of   raises questions like — Have we gone too far with the gender debate? And crushed our primal feelings about each other? Have we fatigued ourselves so much thinking about the prejudices and gender biases that the beautiful vulnerability of a genuine relationship between man and woman is lost, erasing respect and creating conflicts?
 
  It was quite bold an attempt by Padmini and Deepti to address these contemporary concerns through 17th Century erotic poetry that involved Lord Krishna and the courtesans — who were more progressive and liberated than many of us today. The clever use of words and expressions have only made the performance more profound. Complete with apt tunes and musical notes by  , the ‘divine impulse’ of Kshetraya 
  have been employed to drive home the message that by putting identities in boxes, we are only causing more conflict among ourselves.
