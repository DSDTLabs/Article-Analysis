HYDERABAD: The Maoists who are facing a high attrition rate in   and   are recruiting women cadre from Chhattisgarh. The killing of seven women Maoists in the encounter with Greyhounds commandos on Friday shows how Adivasi women guerrillas placed in the vanguard are vulnerable to police bullets.

 
 The 10 Maoists killed in the Pujarikanker encounter are from the second central regional command (CRC) that directly reports to the central military commission member, Devji alias Tipparti Tirupati. The company of 2nd CRC was waiting at   border to carry out the specialized task.
 
 Speaking to STOI, Bhadradri Kothagudem district superintendent of police Amber Kishor Jha said, “At least 40-50% cadre in Maoist ranks are women. As there is a high attrition among Telangana Maoists, they are being forced to recruit women from tribal areas, who are exploited.”
 
 “The CRC company we hit had around 70 armed cadres. They were involved in offences like murders and arson. As they are losing foothold, CRC was assigned to carry out specialized tasks,” said Jha.
 
 Police said Anne Santosh alias Sridhar alias Sagar, a resident of   of district committee member (DCM) rank is heading the second CRC and he is believed to have escaped during the exchange of fire. Prabhakar, another DCM rank Maoist of 2nd CRC was killed in the encounter. Telangana state committee secretary Haribhushan or any other Telangana State Committee member were not at the spot.
 
 An intelligence official of Telangana police said, “Chhattisgarh is the big source of recruitment. Maoists suffered losses in Maharashtra, Odisha and West Bengal.”
 
 Police say exploitation and fatigue are forcing women cadres to surrender. But activists claim they are joining due to state oppression. Varavara Rao told STOI, “We heard from unverified sources Haribhushan has recruited 500 people.”
