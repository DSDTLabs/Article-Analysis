AMRITSAR: On the last day of campaigning for the February 4 assembly elections and   byelection, various candidates tried to put up impressive shows to woo voters even as some had invited big leaders to seek votes for them. 

 The BJP-SAD candidate for Amritsar Lok Sabha bypoll, Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, had MP Manoj Tiwari on his side to canvass in his favour, given the large number of Purvanchali and Bihari immigrants in the constituency. Senior Congress leader and former Union minister Anand Sharma campaigned in favour of party candidate from Amritsar (Central) assembly constituency OP Soni.
 
 Addressing a gathering, Tiwari eulogised policies of the BJP and how they had brought about a desirable change in the country. He also cautioned against AAP, stating that the people of Delhi were having the worst-ever experience of governance.
 
 Chhina on the occasion promised to bring all grants from the Union government for further development of the holy city. Congress Lok Sabha bypoll candidate Gurjit Singh Aujla and assembly candidate from Amritsar (South) Inderbir Singh Bolaria held a road show in the constituency. Similar reports of other candidates making last-ditch attempts to woo voters were received from Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot districts.
