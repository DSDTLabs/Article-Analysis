HYDERABAD: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has set its eyes on a parcel of land attached to the Hindu graveyard on Road No.3 Banjara   to construct a multi-level parking space for cars. If the civic body has its way, it will be the first ever multi-level car parking on a graveyard. 

 According to sources, the civic body has zeroed in on the vacant land in the graveyard to solve the parking problem. The civic body is hard pressed for vacant parcels of land for multi-level car parking lots. The graveyard plot has come in handy for the civic body. 
 
 The revenue department too does not have vacant land in prime locations to create parking lots.
 
 At present, the civic body runs only on multi-level car parking at Abids. Sources said that the GHMC engineering wing officials has zeroed in on the graveyard in   as there is no vacant land between Panjagutta and LV Prasad Eye Hospital.
 
 People participating in funeral at the Panjagutta graveyard are also faced with parking woes. Once the multi-level car parking lot is ready, it will solve the parking problems not only for those visiting the graveyard but also for people visiting Banjara Hills and Panjagutta.
 
 "Based on instructions of mayor  , the ground in the graveyard has been levelled. Senior officials will visit the area for inspection of the land parcel. The area is about one acre. A final decision will be taken after holding talks with various stakeholders involved," a senior official said.
 
 Most of the commercial complexes in Banjara Hills do not have parking space for many vehicles. The proposed parking lot is likely to benefit shoppers. The design for the multi-level car parking will be prepared after senior officials decide on the site. This will be followed by tenders. If everything goes as per plan, work on the parking lot will begin within six months.
