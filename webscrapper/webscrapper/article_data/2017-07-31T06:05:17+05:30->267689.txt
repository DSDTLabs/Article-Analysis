CHANDIGARH: Delayed reaction to complaints made about the Chandigarh-New Delhi   has led to resentment among passengers. In the past one month, they have rued that whenever they complained about certain facilities on board no officer took action on these even after the train reached its destination. They further said that officials preferred to pass the buck even after asking passengers about the details of their problems.

 On the other hand, Dr  , a   member, gave an assurance that during inspection the team would look into the matter and resolve it.
 
 On July 28, a passenger made a complaint that in 12006 Shatabdi an LED was not working. He alleged that during the journey even after the complaint was made the officials were seen passing the buck on each other and no action was taken even after the train arrived in Delhi. On July 26, another passenger made a complaint that there was no water and light in the toilet in Shatabdi, but to no avail. On May 14, in yet another complaint it was stated that the staff was asking for tips on board after serving meals.
 
 Records of the railways revealed that in past in three Shatabdis plying between Chandigarh and New Delhi a large number of complaints had been received about the food quality. As per the railway records, for every 1,000 passengers in 12005/06 train, 1.6 complaints were received per day, in 12011/12 train 2.2 complaints and 12045/46 trains 4.7 complaints were received last year by the authorities through various channels.
