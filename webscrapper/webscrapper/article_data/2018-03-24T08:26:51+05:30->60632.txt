JAIPUR: The  , Bikaner, is facing an embarrassment after they promoted and gave a departmental transfer to a deceased teacher from Jaipur to Ajmer.

 The directorate issued an order on March 22 promoting three Urdu teachers from Grade II to Grade I and transferring them.
 
 As per the order,  , posted in Rajkiya Uchh Madhyamik Vidhalaya, Jaipur, was transferred to GSSS Gegal School in Srinagar Block of Ajmer. Zakir died on April 4, 2015, after he met with an accident in Amber, Jaipur. 
 
 Mukesh Kumar Sharma, deputy director of the directorate, Jaipur, says that promotions and transfers were pending since 2007-08. “We were in a rush to clear pending promotions. That might have been the reason why that order on Shree Zakir was passed. I am sure that his promotion was pending for years before he died. The matter will be looked into,” said Sharma.
 
 Mohammed Umar, the elder brother of Zakir, was surprised to see the name of his deceased brother in the list of transfers last evening. “The death certificate of my brother has been submitted to all concerned departments. My sister-in-law is getting regular pension from the state which shows that the department was aware about my brother’s death. He has three sons and we have requested the Raje government to provide a a job under the ‘Anukampa’ scheme to his eldest son,” said Umar.
 
 The department has failed to update its records even after two years, highlighting poor coordination among various departments of education. “They have made a mistake while issuing an order to only three teachers. Imagine the blunders they may make while doing the same to hundreds of teachers,” said Ameen Kiamkhany, president of Rajasthan Urdu Teachers’ Association.
 
 Though, TOI called and messaged Nathmal Dedal, the director of the education directorate, he was not available for comments.
