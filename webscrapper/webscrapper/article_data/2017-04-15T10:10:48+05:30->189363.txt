JAIPUR: Non-service candidates who applied for admissions to post-graduate medical courses staged a protest on Friday demanding justice and fairness in the admission process.

 The protest follows the recent release of the combined mark list in which in-service candidates secured 199 of the top 200 ranks for PG admissions.
 
 Non-service   met health minister Kalicharan Saraf in the morning and urged him to look into the matter.
 
 They have already moved   (SC) in this regard. The court had issued a notice to the state and asked them to file a response in the matter. Saraf assured them that the government would do everything to ensure fairness to every candidate.
 
 Recently, the state government prepared a merit list based on   order for PG medical courses which gave incentives of 10%, 20% and 30% marks of the total marks secured by in-service doctors in NEET 2017, depending on the duration of service (one, two and three years, respectively).
 
 Now, non-service doctors have moved the SC challenging the HC order. Late on Friday evening, non-service candidates gheraoed the leader of in-service doctors, Dr Jagdish Modi, at SMS Hospital.
 
 Protesting non-service doctors took out a rally from   to the main gate of the SMS Hospital passing through Statue Circle and  .
 
 A representative of non-service doctors said that the SC would hear the case on April 17. It has directed the state government and the   (MCI) to file their responses on the matter on the same day.
 
 The government and MCI responses are likely to play a key role in the matter. “We met the health minister and told him that the future of non-service candidates was in jeopardy. There is only one candidate from non-service doctors in the top 200 of the merit list prepared by the government for post-graduation courses. This is injustice against us,” the protesters said.
