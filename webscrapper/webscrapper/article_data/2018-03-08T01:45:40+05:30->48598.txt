NEW DELHI: Cops are in the hunt of a   of burglars who move around in an Innova car and strike at electronic showrooms across the city. Till date, the gang has struck at least 21 times at different places in northwest, northeast and north Delhi.

 The gang last struck at an electronic showroom in   on February 28. The accused pulled up their car beside the showroom, broke open the shutters and decamped with goods within five minutes. 
 
 The owner of the showroom, Sushil Gupta, said that CCTV footage from the showroom showed three masked men entering with torches and decamping with over 52 LED televisions.
 
 “The robbers removed the wires of some of the CCTV camera in the showroom. We, however, got to know about the Innova car from locals, who thought that some family member had come to the shop to check on the stock,” rued Gupta.
 
 This was, however, not the first time that such a   had occurred. A businessman at   market had reported a similar incident in December last year. The man, Krishan Arora, said that the thieves had reversed their car and parked it right outside his showroom. They then cut open the locks of the shutter and decamped with TVs and some mobile phones.
 
 A day before that, the gang targeted another showroom at Model Town and decamped with goods in a similar way. Police sources say that at least six such incidents were reported from across the city.
