CHANDIGARH: The enforcement directorate (ED), which is probing the money laundering case with regard to the allotment of a plot to   (AJL) in  , has asserted that former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh   had “misused his position and caused wrongful gains to the   and corresponding loss to the state exchequer”.

 The agency told the court that the Panchkula plot worth crores was re-allotted to the AJL for Rs 59 lakh, including interest, though they were not even legally entitled for re-allotment.
 
 These assertions were made by the ED before the Punjab and Haryana HC on Wednesday in response to a petition filed by Moti Lal Vora, veteran congress leader and chairman of AJL, seeking quashing of enforcement case investigation report (ECIR) registered by ED.
 
 Appearing for ED, additional solicitor general, Satya Pal Jain informed the HC that Vora had concealed a vital fact regarding representations by the AJL to Bansi Lal for restoration of a plot and its non-consideration by the former CM in 1997. Jain also submitted a detailed reply from the ED which said that the initial investigation had revealed that the AJL, after non-consideration of its request by Bansi Lal, did not make any effort. It waited for asuitable time and period for getting a favourable order regarding restoration. The HC has adjourned the case for July 31 for further hearing.
 
 The entire controversy pertains to an institutional plot which was allotted by Huda to the AJL in 1982 but the same was resumed in 1992 for non-construction. The appeal and revision filed by the AJL against resumption of plot were dismissed by administrator, Huda, and financial commissioner, town and country planning, Haryana, in 1995 and 1996, respectively. 
 
 However, when Hooda became CM in 2005, he allowed re-allotment of the plot to the AJL.
