VASCO:   MLA and panchayat minister,   said that when it comes to employment opportunities, industrial units must consider Goans on priority.

 “Everybody has a right to relocate anywhere in the country and take up job opportunities, but that doesn't mean that locals should be overlooked. Adequate training should be given to Goan youth so that they are gainfully employed,” he said.
 
 Godinho informed that business units operating in   at Dabolim have deliberately withheld taxes due to the local panchayat.
 
 On Friday, he directed representives from the units operating in the estate to clear all their payments.
 
 He said that some issues have been also raised by Chicalim comunidade, whereby some units have encroached upon land.
 
 “Some of the units have indulged in land encroachment. A situation should not arise in future wherein land in Goa is taken over by outsiders, and locals end up with neither land nor employment,” Godhino said
