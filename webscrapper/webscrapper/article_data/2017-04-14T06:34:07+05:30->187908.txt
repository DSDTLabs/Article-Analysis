LUCKNOW: During Muharram,   is like Lucknow and during  , like Varanasi, said economist Satnarine Balkaransingh. 

 An immigrant to the Caribbean island country of Trinidad and Tobago, Balkaransingh was addressing a lecture organised by Lucknow University’s sociology department on Thursday. 
 
 The event was to mark the completion of 100 years of the end of Indian   system in which Indians were sent to meet labour shortage in Mauritius, Fiji, South Africa, La Reunion, the West Indies and Caribbean countries.
 
 “The education, health and working condition of people sent to meet labour shortages was slightly better than the slavery system but Indians were not considered to be the part of their society,” said Balkaransingh.
 
 To show the interconnection of India and Trinidad and Tobago, Balkaransingh made a presentation of his research and photographs captured in 1990 comparing festival celebrated in India and on the Island. He asked students to explore the cultures and pursue research in the field.
 
 Like former Trinidadian Prime Minister Kamla Persad Bissessar, who successfully found her roots in Buxar, Indians could also trace their families in Trinidad, he said. 
 
 “Like me, other immigrants are still looking for their roots in India. The indenture system has broken families and led Indians to face horrible conditions, hence its end is celebrated even after 100 years,” he added.
 
 “With the help of Prof Manoj Dixit, I researched the roots of immigrants and have now transformed it into a book ‘Shaping of a Culture’,” said Balkaransingh.
