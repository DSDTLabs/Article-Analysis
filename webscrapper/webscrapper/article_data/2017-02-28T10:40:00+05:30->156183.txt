 With this, Telangana is ready to receive power from the 765 kv Nizamabad substation under the   Hyderabad transmission scheme. The two power discoms are expected to get 1,000 mw power from Chhattisgarh from March second week. The power purchase agreement in this regard was signed in September 2015. Work on the 400 kv Maheshwaram sub-station and the connected lines, which hold the key to availing power supply from Chhattisgarh state, is progressing swiftly and the executing agencies have assured of their completion by April.
 
 “Telangana has already booked a slot for evacuation of 1,000 MW power from Janjgir thermal power project in Chhattisgarh on the 765 kv double-circuit line being commissioned with a total transmission capacity of 4,350 MW power,“ said D Prabhakar Rao, CMD of  .
 
 After signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in November 2014, power utilities of the two states signed the power purchase agreement in 2015.
 
 PGCIL officials have also taken up works on the Warangal-Varora (Maharash tra) powerline and with the completion of the two lines, Wardha-Dichpally and Warangal-Varora, power can be received and supplied between the southern grid and the new grid. As a result, there will be easy access of power across the country.
 
 At the same time, availability of Chhattisgarh power is likely to help the two discoms of Telangana to overcome power shortage situation in the state. Energy officials are now confident to meet the power demand beyond 175 million units (MU) during the crucial stages of rabi and summer.
