 Though she has some basic idea about cricket, Aishwarya says that it’s been quite an experience training for the film. “It is not easy to play this game despite knowing the basics. I have already begun training for it. Also, to be honest, I had never watched women’s cricket before signing this film, but now, I have started following it. I love the body language of the women cricketers and the attitude with which they carry themselves. It’s an honour to play a woman cricketer on screen,” she says, adding, “This one’s close to my heart and I have been working sincerely on the project. The film is sure to reach pan-Indian audiences.”
