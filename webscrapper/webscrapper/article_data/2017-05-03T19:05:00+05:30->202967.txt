KOLKATA:   and   go into Wednesday's match at the Eden Gardens with different perspectives. While Kolkata suffered only their third defeat this   season at the hands of Sunrisers Hyderabad, Pune boosted their chances of making the cut for the playoff stage by taming the Gujarat Lions on Monday.

 Coincidentally, both matches were decided by individual performances. Kolkata were laid low by  's 59-ball 126 in Hyderabad, while Ben Stokes single-handedly took Pune home with a blistering unbeaten 103 off 63 balls.
 
 Stokes' red-hot form will, no doubt, be a worry for  's team as Warner too had dished out similar treatment to Kolkata which boasts the most balanced attack in the tournament.
 
 It's true that Pune have a lot more riding on Wednesday's result than Kolkata. Having won six of the 10 matches they have played so far,  's team is now the odds-on favourite to seal a playoff berth. A victory on Wednesday will not only see them draw level with Kolkata on 14 points, but also help Pune to avenge the first-leg loss they had suffered at home last week. Pune's Kolkata-based owner would cherish a victory at the Eden Gardens where his team should also enjoy a fair bit of support.
 
 The home team, on the other hand, already has seven wins under their belt, but would be keen to bounce back quickly from the Warner mauling in a bid to finish among the top-two. Skipper Gambhir will surely take heart from the fact that the Eden Gardens has accorded plenty of home comfort to his team which has only lost one match here this season.
