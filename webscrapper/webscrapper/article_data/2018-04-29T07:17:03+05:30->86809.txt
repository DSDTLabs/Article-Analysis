KOLKATA: The East-West project touched another milestone on Saturday after the   network received its first power connection.

 
 Around 3.30pm, energizing of the ‘receiving’ and ‘traction’ substations — set up inside the maintenance depot at   — took place in presence of electrical engineers and senior officials of the Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation, which is implementing the Rs 8,575-crore underwater corridor.
 
 It is from here electricity will flow to the entire system. The substation with AC 33KV phase power will gradually energize the stations and the entire East-West network, from Sector V to Salt Lake in the first phase and eventually the entire 16.55km stretch between Howrah Maidan from Salt Lake.
 
 “We are subsequently going to energize the depot’s test tracks and the stinger system with 750V DC power. This will be used in upcoming trial runs of the rakes,” a senior official explained.
 
 The ‘receiving’ and ‘traction’ substations, armed with high-speed circuit breaker, have been constructed by   with state-of-the-art technology from Germany. Power (with a 40 MVA load) is being provided by WBSEDCL. The electrical inspector to the Union power ministry has provided necessary technical approvals for energization.
 
 The trial run is due to begin in the middle of May along the elevated viaduct from Sector V to Salt Lake stadium. “Once the second rake comes from Bengaluru, the trial run to synchronise the trains with the system will begin,” said an official. A team of 40 engineers from BEML will help   in conducting trial runs.
