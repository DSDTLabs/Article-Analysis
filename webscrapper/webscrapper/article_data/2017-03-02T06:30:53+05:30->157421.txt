JALANDHAR:   wants to focus on her   and is planning to return to her college in New Delhi. As mediapersons remained stationed outside her house in   for most part of the day, Gurmehar came out for sometime and thanked all those who supported her. She also clarified that the campaign was not alone hers but of other students as well. She also asked the media to leave her alone.

 Jalandhar police has posted two women constables at her residence to ensure Gurmehar’s security. 
 
 Her grandfather Kanwaljit Singh accompanied activists of Sikh Talmel Committee and local Singh sabhas to submit a memorandum to Jalandhar deputy commissioner K K Yadav urging him to communicate to the Delhi government their plea for immediate arrest of culprits, who had threatened her with rape on social media. They also said as Gurmehar would return to Delhi soon, her security should be ensured there.
 
 These organizations also honoured her grandfather, who said Gurmehar would return to Delhi to complete her studies and the family was not afraid. “Guru Gobind Singh’s children are not afraid of such threats,” he said, adding that Gurmehar did not say anything wrong and advocating peace did not amount to anti-national comments.
 
 Harpreet Singh Baweja, who live in Gurmehar’s neighbourhood, said the area residents were shocked the way Gurmehar was targeted on social media. 
 
 Meanwhile, several members of the Punjab Students Union (PSU) also held a demonstration at Lyallpur Khalsa College to oppose   and threats to Gurmehar. Istri Jagriti Manch activists also held a protest in Company Bagh Chowk and alleged that fascist forces were trying to silence dissenting voices.
 
 Punjab BSP president Rashpal Raju also expressed solidarity with Gurmehar and said rape and other threats to her in fact exposed the ABVP. Manjit SIngh Bhola-led All-India Sikh Students’ Federation also expressed solidarity with her.
