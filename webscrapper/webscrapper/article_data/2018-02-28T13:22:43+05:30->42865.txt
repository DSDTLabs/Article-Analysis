MYSURU: Film actor and director   on Tuesday lodged a private complaint against BJP MP   accusing him of insulting remarks on social networking sites. The actor has claimed Re 1 as damages. 

 Rai’s counsel M Mahadeva Swamy told TOI the defamation and damages suit will come up for hearing on March 3. The court will hear the argument of the complainant before proceeding. The MP has been accused under Sections 499 (defamation), 500 (punishment for defamation) and 503 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 The advocate said the MP defamed Rai by statements on Twitter and Facebook in early October 2017. A notice was served, seeking an apology. He was also asked why no legal action can be initiated against him. The MP didn’t reply to the notice. “With no other option left, we have gone to court,” the advocate said.
 
 Mahadeva Swamy said, “We have saved the MP’s statements on social networking sites and submitted them to the court.”
 
 After filing the petition in the IV JMFC court, Rai told mediapersons about the complaint but didn’t divulge any details of the case saying it would be sub judice. Mahadeva Swamy claimed his client wants to teach the MP a lesson for making false accusations.
