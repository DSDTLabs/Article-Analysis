CHANDIGARH:   police were on Thursday awarded   Smart Policing Award-2018 at the Homeland Security Conference in New Delhi. Gurjot Singh Kaler, DSP, received the   from the minister of state for parliamentary affairs and statistics Vijay Goel. Over 200 entries were received for the award.

 The award had been presented for Punjab police’s initiative for successfully implementing Punjab Artificial Intelligence System (PAIS) under the supervision of director general (intelligence) Dinkar Gupta. A criminal identification software, PAIS has been implemented in the form of a mobile application in a step to curb the activities of gangsters and other criminals. Its web version is also available. Punjab police had launched it across the entire state in July last year.
 
 Punjab police spokesperson said as part of this system the data of all arrested criminals is being captured (about 500 daily) from all prisons of the state and fed into the server. Each criminal is given a unique ID and all relevant information relating to the criminal involving about 10 basic parameters is fed into the system. Since July last year, nearly 90,000 criminal dossiers have been prepared in the state, which are being used by more than 3,000 investigating officers in different districts or units for identifying and arresting criminals. Advanced technology of PAIS helps in identifying the criminals through facial recognition fused with criminal’s personal details, physical features, address, crime details and jail details.
