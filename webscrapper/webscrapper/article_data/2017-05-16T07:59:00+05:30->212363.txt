Panaji: For the first time in more than a decade, a student attained the top score in physics, chemistry and mathematics, individually, at the Goa Common Entrance   ( ) 2017. 

 Panaji-based Pratheek D’Souza Rebello had earlier beat the previous best score from Goa in the IITJEE (main)  .
 
 Rebello scored 74 and 72, respectively, out of 75 in mathematics and chemistry, outdoing 2016’s GCET top scores in the subjects, and matched last year’s highest score of 70 out of 75 in physics. His total has touched an outstanding 216 out of 225 in physics, chemistry and mathematics.
 
 Though Rebello has emerged as the topmost candidate for an engineering seat in Goa, he has his heart set on an IIT seat, he said.
 
 “Pratheek has also answered the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), in which, too, he has done well. But, his interest lies in chemistry and mathematics and so he wants to pursue engineering at an IIT,” Vyankatesh Prabhudesai, director of Mushtifund Aryaan Higher Secondary School, said.
 
 Rebello, along with biology subject topper Jairam Naik, may have helped improve or at least maintain 2016’s top GCET marks, but average marks scored by students who took the GCET dropped further in 2017 in physics and chemistry.
 
 The average marks scored by students are on a decline over the last few years at GCET, making it easier to bag an engineering degree seat in Goa with each passing year. Altogether, 5,116 students registered to answer the GCET and there are 1,230 engineering seats in Goa. And with the average scores being less than 50% at 20.53 and 25.20 in physics and chemistry, respectively, out of 75 this year, even those with a very low physics-chemistry-mathematics total have a chance at an engineering seat.
 
 These average scores have come down hugely over the years from 26.7 out of 75 in physics and 31 out of 75 in chemistry in 2013.
 
 But, despite the obvious decline in GCET scores over the last few years, S S Major, coordinator from IIT Bombay, which helps the state directorate of technical   to conduct GCET, attributed the scores as usual to 'normal fluctuation'. 
 
 In mathematics though, the average score has improved by a huge margin from 22.16 in 2016 to 29.47 this year.
 
 This year’s improved top subject-wise scores at GCET don’t have much relevance to the admissions to professional courses in Goa. “Most of the top scorers look at GCET as a practice test as they actually aim for seats at IITs, BITS, IISc, AIIMs or NITs,” Prabhudesai said.
 
 The cream at the GCET usually move out, lowering the benchmark for admission to Goa seats.
 
 The least marks scored in GCET this year are five in physics, nine in chemistry, and 11 in mathematics and biology.
 
 The GCET has been held in 2017 for admission to degree programmes of engineering, pharmacy, nursing and paramedical.
