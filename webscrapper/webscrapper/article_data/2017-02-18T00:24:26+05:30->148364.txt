MUMBAI: As   gear up for the 13th annual   this Sunday (February 19), many of them expressed concern over the fast  . A total of 300 participants, well above the upper limit of 250, have registered for the event this year.

 The BirdRaces have been conceptualized to help look at the   (birdlife) of urban areas and their surrounding wealth of habitats, popularize bird-watching and create better understanding of other aspects of biodiversity and environment. “We have compiled data of bird species recorded during BirdRaces in the last 10 years. While the tabulation of various birds are seen to be either increasing or decreasing for various factors, it is glaring to see so many bird habitats reducing or even vanishing over the years,” said bird watcher, author and key organiser of the BirdRaces,  .
 
 Monga added that the state government and agencies must ensure there are no more destruction of bird habitats. “A vast chunk of wetlands in Uran and surrounding areas have gone due to rapid construction. Even grasslands are disappearing. These are important for the conservation of various birds,'' said Monga.
 
 During the BirdRace, the organisers said, several teams go to various areas in and around Mumbai to watch and record bird species from dawn to dusk. After that, the teams converge at one spot to discuss their experiences.
 
 Experts have noticed a decline of numerous smaller birds from right within the urban realm of Mumbai. Open scrub and grass habitats are paying an enormous price in the Mumbai region. This naturally has led to the near disappearance of several species specific to such habitats such as larks, chats, pipits, harriers, lapwings, nightjars etc. “Likewise in some of the forested tracts, we have observed a qualitative decline in the extent and nature of the ground flora and herbage, and this has affected several terrestrial birds,” said Monga.
