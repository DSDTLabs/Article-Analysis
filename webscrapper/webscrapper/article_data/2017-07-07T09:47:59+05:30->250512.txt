It seems like a surreal case of reel-life-turning-real! Remember that wedding scene from   where   and   tie the knot? Well, that’s going to play out for real at a plush Goa location early this October. Yes, the couple who got engaged in Hyderabad in January have decided to go in for a fun beach wedding in Goa. A source close to the couple informs, “It will be a weekend wedding with just a close bunch of friends and family — say a 100-odd people. There will be a traditional Telugu ceremony on Day 1. The following Sunday, there will be a Christian wedding at a heritage church in Goa, where   and   will exchange vows.” Again, sounds like a throwback to that church wedding scene from the duo’s debut film Yeh Maya Chesave, right? Looks like these two were meant to be!
