CHANDIGARH:   police have bought 11 cameras for Rs 1.36 lakh each to keep an eye on goings-on at traffic nakas. 

 The traffic wing of Chandigarh   unveiled the cameras, bought for a total of Rs 15 lakh, at an event organised as part of Road Safety Week here, said SSP (traffic) Shashank Anand here on Tuesday. UT administrator V P Singh Badnore launched the system, which the police have force dubbed as 'Divya Drishti', or divine sight. The SSP said all happenings at traffic nakas would be beamed live from these cameras to the mobile phones of senior police officials. He added that four such cameras would be installed at every naka, so that all interactions between motorists and traffic cops could be covered. "Two cameras will cover the barricades at the back and two at the front. The cameras would have a feature for automatically noting down the registration number of vehicles. The new project will give a 360Â° view of the naka," he said.
 
 The SSP said they had decided to buy the system as they had been receiving complaints of either cops misbehaving with motorists or vice-versa. "Also, the system will help us ensure that no will able to keep on malpractices at nakas," he said.
 
 The project was first proposed in 2016, and the police force zeroed-in on the equipment it hads bought after several demonstrations, said an officer in   who did not wish to be named. "We procured the cameras only after we were satisfied with the performance of these ones," said the oficer.
