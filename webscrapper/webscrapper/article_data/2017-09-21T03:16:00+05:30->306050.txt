Mapusa: Suicide rates in Goa are at an alarming high and currently stand above the national average, according to Bastora-based NGO COOJ that works towards bringing a lasting change in the lives of people affected with mental illness through various evidence based strategies.

 “Suicide is a big problem in the country and a bigger one in Goa as the state’s suicide rate is higher than the national figures. The national rate is 11.7 per lakh population while in Goa it is 15.8 per lakh population,” COOJ director and psychiatrist Dr Peter Castelino said, while speaking at a function at North Goa district hospital on Sunday evening. A memorial service had been organised for suicide victims at the district hospital to observe World Suicide Prevention Day (September 10). 
 
 ‘Take a minute, change a life’ is the theme for this year’s suicide prevention campaign, as part of which a series of awareness program will be organized in Bardez taluka under the ‘Yellow Bardez’ program.
 
 Dr Castelino said there is a need to create awareness as suicide is preventable. There is a need to train people and have a network to create awareness among people who need someone to listen to them to prevent such cases.
 
 Commenting on the ‘Blue Whale Challenge’, an online dare game linked to teen deaths across the world, Dr Rajesh Dhume said those ending their lives are not committing suicide but are being murdered as someone tells them to follow 50 steps and then end their lives. He said the government should take control of such situations.
