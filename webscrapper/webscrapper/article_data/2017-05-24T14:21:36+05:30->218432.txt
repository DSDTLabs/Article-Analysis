 The ' ' star said her husband is "full of surprises". "You would think I would catch on that something's happening, but I don't, ever... (For our anniversary,) I wanted to stay in the room and play backgammon, because I was winning."
 
 "And he was like, 'No, we should go to dinner.' He surprised me at dinner with a beautiful gift and a song and a singer; it was just amazing," she gushes.
