GURUGRAM: Work on the Old Delhi-Gurugram Road, which is being developed as an alternative link between the two cities, has been stuck for almost six months due to a pending no-objection certificate from the forest department.

 MCG sources said while work on the main carriageway had been completed, construction of drains, cycle tracks and footpaths along the state highway had been pending for the want of an  . 
 
 “The land required for these services comes under the forest department and without its permission, work cannot be continued. So, we submitted an application seeking a NOC around six months ago. But we are yet to get it,” said a senior MCG official.
 
 The forest conservator did not reply to calls or messages sent to him on the matter.
 
 According to MCG officials, the drains are the most crucial among the pending services. “The Old Delhi-Gurugram Road has been built on an elevation from the surface and in case of heavy rainfall, there will be flooding in the areas along the road,” said sources at MCG. They added if the drains weren’t constructed in time before monsoon, rainwater from the road might enter the buildings.
 
 In 2016, Dundahera villagers had protested and stalled work on the project, alleging that the concrete road would block the flow of rainwater. The villagers later agreed to let the construction work start after MCG conceded to the villagers’ demand to build a stormwater drain along the road.
