Bhopal: Sand mafia caused an irreparable loss to a section of an ancient monument of archaeological importance in Gwalior district to transport illegally mined sand. The mafia men pulled down some remains of the ancient fort to make way for uninterrupted movement of heavy vehicles and transport illegally mined sand. Villages around Dabra in Gwalior district are infamous for rampant illegal mining.  They demolished outer wall of the fort earlier this month, a local official said. Several complaints were lodged on CM Help Line, but in vain, a local municipal official, pleading anonymity, said. If some one dared to raise the issue at the local level, those into sand mining attacked to silence him. “They attack us and open fire to terrorise villagers,” officials said. Officials said the ancient fort built by pre-Parmar rulers is located at Panwaya village — about 25 km from of city of Dabra. In ancient times, Panwaya was known as Padmawat where famous Rangmanch of Bhavbhuti — 8th century scholar of India noted for his plays and poetry — is also located. Spread over an acre of land, the fort sits on banks of river Sindh and Parwati, they said. Demolishing a large portion of the ruins of the fort, the sand mafia has created two pathways inside the ancient fort. One of them is being used to reach the river Sindh directly. The sand-laden trucks are taken to Gwalior through the fort area as it serves as a short cut to reach Gwalior via Chinnor village, sources said. Talking to TOI, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Iqbal Mohammad of Bhitarwar, said, “We have learned about the issue. We are going to take action against people involved in sand mining there.” The ASI is being informed about the site, he said.  Sources said sand mafia began constructing a temporary bridge over shallow part of the river Sindh to facilitate digging of sand and transportation. Two months ago, the district administration had initiated action against sand mafia and confiscated their equipment.
