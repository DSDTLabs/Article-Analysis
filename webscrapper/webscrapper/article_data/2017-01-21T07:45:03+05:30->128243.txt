LUCKNOW: LDA plans to build 11 new parking spaces across the city to accommodate the increasing number of cars. Work has already begun on two of those lots.

 As per PWD’s estimates, the number of vehicles increase by 8% every year while roads cannot be widened as almost 95% roads are operating on the maximum width. Now LDA would utilise the basements of parks in colonies to create parking spaces.
 
 LDA top brass asked executive engineers to prepare a report on parks in their respective zones, area available, cost of construction and number of cars they can accommodate. The engineers have furnished a list of 11 such parks. These parks are in Gomtinagar, Chowk, Kanpur Road, Kapoorthala, Kaiserbagh, Aminabad, Lal Kuan and LDA’s  . As per LDA’s plans, parks’ basements, if turned into parking facilities, would be able to accommodate around 3,000 cars. The total cost of constructing basement parking is estimated at Rs 211 crore.
 
 An LDA official said, “The file was prepared around a year ago but couldn’t be implemented till date because of approvals needed from various levels. Work has started at Kapoorthala and Chowk park.”
 
 Besides, LDA is planning to restore the basements of commercial complexes, which have been illegally given out to shops and vendors, for parking.
