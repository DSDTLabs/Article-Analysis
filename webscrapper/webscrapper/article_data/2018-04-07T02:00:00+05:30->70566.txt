PATNA: Dermatologists have appealed to insurance regulatory authorities to consider providing medical   for   prescribed for treatment of skin ailments as they are very expensive.

 “Certain skin conditions like extensive psoriasis and pemphigus are life-threatening ones. Biologics, useful in such conditions, are beyond the reach of common man because of high cost,” Indian Association of Dermatologists Venereologists and Leprologists (IADVL)’s   chapter secretary Dr Vikas Shankar said while addressing a continuing medical education session organised in   on the ‘World Skin Health Day’ on Friday.
 
 In states like Tamil Nadu, Dr Shankar pointed out, these drugs are available free of cost in government hospitals.
 
 The dermatologists attending the event also cautioned people against use of steroid and fairness creams. “The Union health ministry should include such creams in Schedule- H drugs under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 to prevent their sale without doctors’ prescriptions,” pleaded IADVL’s Bihar chapter president Dr M K Sinha.
 
 “Topical steroid creams are abused and misused not only in the treatment of skin infections caused by bacteria and fungus but also to lighten one’s skin colour in an unscientific, hazardous manner,” Dr Sinha said and added this had led to India harbouring a superbug of fungus which is resistant to antifungal treatment.
