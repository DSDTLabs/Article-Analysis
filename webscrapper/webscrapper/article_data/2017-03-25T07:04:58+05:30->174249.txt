Kuala Lumpur: Malaysian PM   is expected to sign 15 agreements worth more than $5 billion during his meeting with his Indian counterpart   in New Delhi early next month -marking the first high level visit by a foreign head of government after a string of assembly elections.

 Though the key engagement of the Malaysian team would be with the Centre and the three apex chambers -Ficci, Assocham and CII, the trade and economic impetus will come from the states. Prominent amongst these are the signing of 7 bids worth $1.2-$1.4 by Malaysia's   for Rajasthan state highways, for which Najib has included a day's visit to Jaipur on April 2.   is also setting up a 258-acre technology park in Amravati and getting into an MoU with Bengaluru for an optic fiber and smart city project worth $300 million.
 
 India's investment in Malaysian economy would include a proposed 1.6 million tonne urea plant. Talks on laying of railway tracks by IRCON International for the Serendah-Klang-Seremban line will also be held.
 
 Indian high commissio ner to Malaysia, Tirumurti, said this visit could result in setting up of an ayurveda chair in Malaysia, which would enable Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman to offer a degree course in ayurveda for the first time in the country . While the visit is seen as a kick-off to events highlighting the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries, there is a not-so-obvious political intent. Sources said Najib will make an effort to reach out to the huge Indian diaspora, predominantly Tamil, by including Chennai in his itinerary . General elections in Malaysia are due next year and there are more than 2.5 million people of Indian descent part of the electorate.
