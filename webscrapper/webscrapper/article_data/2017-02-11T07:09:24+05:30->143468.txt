  Tytler, who did not appear in person despite a court notice on Friday, filed a reply through his counsel stressing that CBI's plea was filed with a "malafide intention" thereby resulting in "gross misuse of law". Senior lawyer H S Phoolka, appearing for CBI, referred to a media report and pointed out that Tytler had given a statement earlier that reportedly showed willingness to undergo the test. CBI reasoned that the court had on December 4, 2015 said that a lie-detection test may be conducted, if required. 
 
  Also, arms dealer Abhishek Verma, who was also issued a notice, appeared in court and argued through his counsel Maninder Singh that a provision in law allows him to give a statement before a magistrate, therefore, negating the need for the test. Singh urged the court to pass directions over "security threats" to his client. He said that past instances have jeopardised Verma's safety. The court granted time to Verma to file a written reply and posted the matter to February 23.
