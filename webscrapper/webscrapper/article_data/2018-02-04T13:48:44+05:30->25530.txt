CHENNAI: Forest department officials from Viluppuram released 300 olive ridley   hatchlings into the   at Basavankuppam beach near   on Friday.

 District forest officer V C Rahul said female olive ridley turtles started arriving at the beach on December 16 last year to lay eggs. Officials collected 304 eggs which were safely incubated in the nursery created by the department at Basavankuppam. After about 46 days of incubation, the young ones broke the eggs and began coming out in groups. 
 
 Only four eggs failed to hatch. The remaining turtles were safely released into the water in the morning before it became warm. Female turtles have laid 4,006 eggs on this stretch so far. On an average, a female lays up to three clutches per season. The incubating period varies from 45 to 55 days, depending upon weather conditions, he said. “We hope to collect about 10,000 olive ridley eggs this season and shift them to the hatchery for successful incubation,” he added.
