NEW DELHI: Students at Delhi University’s   on Friday protested against the   for not being allowed to sit for their exam as they were short of attendance. The dean, Ved Kumari, said that the students were denied permission as   (BCI) guidelines require them to have at least 70%   to sit for the exams.

 A similar incident had occurred last year when a large number of students protested against being barred to give the exams, forcing the faculty and BCI to give them a concession. A video of students threatening and abusing the dean had gone viral on the internet.
 
 Several students at Law Faculty’s three centres — Campus Law Centre (CLC), Law Centre-I and II — were stopped by the dean from giving the Crime-II paper. The students then allegedly shut down classrooms and got into a verbal altercation with the dean. Kumari said that “some of them threatened to commit suicide if they were not permitted to sit for the exam.”
 
 The examinees, however, said that they were not disrespectful to the dean. “Given our small number, we requested her to allow us to take the exam as our careers are at stake,” said a student.
 
 Kumari, however, said that she “cannot allow students who skip classes get a concession every year.” The students clarified that the professor in-charge (PIC) of CLC had given a notification that they could appear for the exam after signing an undertaking.
 
 “In the letter to the pro-VC, it was mentioned that I was not present in the faculty and the dean (students’ welfare) had intervened in the matter. The problem arose as my approval was not sought,” Kumari added.
 
 A first-year student of CLC said, “The students are suffering because of the tiff between the PIC and the dean. We protested as there was no clarity on being allowed to sit for the exams.”
 
 A meeting was later called by the administration and Friday’s exam was postponed. “The exam will be conducted on an appropriate date,” Kumari said.
