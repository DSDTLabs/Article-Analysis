ALLAHABAD: The   on Thursday upheld an order of the   by which he had quashed summons issued by a magistrate against then   and others in relation to Gorakhpur riots of 2007.

 According to the case file, one Rasheed Khan had lodged an FIR against Yogi and some others at   on January 27, 2007, for allegedly promoting enmity between two groups of people. Subsequently, police filed a chargesheet against Yogi and others. A magistrate took cognizance of the chargesheet and issued an order summoning the accused, including Yogi. However, the Gorakhpur sessions court turned down the magistrateâ€™s order on January 28, 2017. Khan then moved a petition in the high court challenging the sessions court order on the ground that he was not given an opportunity to be heard.
 
 Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, his counsel submitted in the high court that the sessions judge quashed the order without giving his client a chance to be heard although as an informant in the case he was a necessary party.
 
 Opposing the petition, the state counsels submitted that while passing the order, the magistrate was required to obtain prior approval of state government, which was not taken. Thus, the sessions court rightly set aside the order and remanded the matter to the magistrate for fresh consideration.
 
 After hearing both the sides, Justice B K Narayana of the high court on Thursday dismissed the petition while upholding the order of the Gorakhpur sessions judge.
