NAVI MUMBAI: Almost 35 million cubic metres of water was lost due to evaporation between June 2015 and June 2016 at Barvi, Morbe and Hetawane dams, which supply water to the city.

 When calculated in terms of bottles, this accounts for the loss of 3,480 crore one-litre bottles of water. This is a mind boggling number, considering that in summer even a one-litre bottle of water is good enough to quench thirst.
 
 Though it may seem appalling, this year the losses could be more, as the irrigation department has factored in higher summer temperatures, going by per  .
 
 Dam sources said they factor transportation, distribution and evaporation losses to the total reservoir capacity to derive the net quantum of water. The total loss, on an average, is around 20-25% (average), depending on supply and evaporation. While transportation and distribution can be controlled with efficiency, evaporation is a natural phenomenon, said sources.
 
 Irrigation department owns   and monitors the functioning of daily water release from MIDCâ€™s  , while NMMC is the sole authority for Morbe dam that it owns.
 
 Barvi dam pegs the average evaporation loss at 10%, Morbe at 5% and Hetawane dam at 7-8%. The loss also depends on the structure of the base of the dam. A dam with cup-shaped flooring will lose less while a saucer shaped one would lose more water due to evaporation.
 
 And now, with Holi on Monday, revellers would do well to minimise  , as the invisible evaporation cannot be prevented because it is a natural phenomenon.
