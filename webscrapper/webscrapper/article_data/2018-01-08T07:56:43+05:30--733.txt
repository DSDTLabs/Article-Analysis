AHMEDABAD: Our   are being overburdened by vehicles at the rate of 12% to 15% every year with   added to the already worsening situation of our city’s arterial lifelines.

 A recent study by department of civil engineering of L D College, and KSV University, had evaluated traffic congestion at six important intersections in Ahmedabad. An important parameter they had measured during research was the peak saturation flow of traffic — a study which describes the number of passenger car units (pcu) in a dense flow of traffic for a specific intersection lane group — at these junctions.
 
 The study found that if the observed capacity of a road like Manav Mandir to Gurukul was 4,400 PCUs per hour in one direction, the peak saturation flow on this stretch increased to 10,565 PCUs.
 
 In another case for CG Road, if the observed capacity was 5,000 PCUs, the peak saturation flow was calculated to be 7,751 PCUs. Similarly for the Paldi-Ellisbridge stretch if the observed capacity is 4,700 PCUs per hour, the peak saturation flow was calculated to be 8,369 PCUs per hour. The study clearly shows how each road hits a PCU beyond its maximum carrying capacity during peak hours leading to frequent traffic jams.
 
 A senior professor at Cept University had told TOI earlier, “When it comes to cities, land availability to each citizen gets smaller. In US and European cities, each citizen gets 3-4 square metres of space, while in Ahmedabad it is 0.8 to 0.9 square metres per citizen. The senior professor added that in case of Indian cities it was vital to promote public transport.
