NEW DELHI: It seems the ‘pitch fixing’ claims made on Saturday were just the tip of the iceberg as the full undercover documentary by news channel Al Jazeera points to possible spot-fixing in two Test matches involving India - against England in Chennai in 2016 and against Australia in Ranchi last year. The   ( ) has taken serious note of the allegations in the documentary and a thorough investigation is already underway.

 
 “We had received information about this sting earlier this month and already asked for entire evidence and other relevant information related in possession of Al Jazeera. In fact, ICC’s   general manager Alex Marshall has already issued a statement in this regard on May 22nd. Now that the full documentary has been aired, we have most of the details and we’ll continue our investigation,” an ICC official told TOI on Sunday.
 
 BCCI’s outgoing ACU chief Neeraj Kumar confirmed that the investigation is in ICC’s hands. “BCCI will not be conducting any enquiry as of now. We’ll only assist ICC wherever they deem necessary. In regards to Mumbai’s former cricketer  , he’s not employed by BCCI, so we’ll not be taking any action against him at the moment. If ICC gives us evidence against Morris or anyone else involved, we’ll take appropriate action,” Kumar told TOI.
 
 Ajit Singh, who will replace Kumar as ACU head, also reiterated BCCI’s stand. “The matches on which the sting operations were done are international matches and fall under the purview of the ICC. If the ICC wants our assistance, we are ready to help,” he told TOI.
