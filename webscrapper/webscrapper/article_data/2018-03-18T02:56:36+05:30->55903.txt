NEW DELHI: Assuring the party “old-guard” about their future role in Congress,   on Saturday said he would take the youth and seniors together, adding that it was a   tradition to embrace change without forgetting the party’s legacy.

 
 Speaking at AICC’s 84th plenary session which is themed “Change is Now” in keeping with Rahul’s take over, the Gandhi scion said, “If the youths have to take the Congress forward, it cannot be done without the experience of the party veterans.” He added, “My task is to take together the seniors and the youth.”
 
 Rahul’s mention of the issue right at the top of his very brief opening speech showed that it required addressing in the wake of concerns among senior leaders about their future after  . The ‘old guard vs GenNext’ faultline is seen as one of the reasons why the party has not gelled as an organisation in recent years.
 
 In her address, Sonia Gandhi urged the party to support Rahul which was seen as an appeal to the generation which has worked under her leadership almost for two decades.
 
 Rahul added weight to his reassuring words by pointing to former PM Manmohan Singh, P Chidamabaram, Punjab chief minister   and   chief minister  , who were sitting in the front rows saying, “Representatives of the party have fought hard to keep the Congress ideology alive. Senior leaders of the Congress will guide the youth and take the party forward.”
