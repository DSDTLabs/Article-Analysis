Actor   (Nirahua) is all set to mark his   debut with Lakshmi Ganpathy Films’ ' '. While the movie’s trailer has offered glimpses of its impressive VFX and cinematography, what’s also garnering a lot of appreciation is the period costume of the star cast, especially the protagonist, Nirahua.

 In keeping with the subtle yet brave character he plays, his costumes have less of gold and more of browns and coppers — symbolising loyalty, devotion and love. The actor’s armour has been done in leather and then painted in metal, to lend it a natural look. He recalls, “It used to take me two-three hours to get ready, but my look helped me a lot to get into the skin of the character. Even when I was injured during the shoot, the moment I would wear my costume, I used to feel like a warrior. My look in the film reflects my character.” 
 Interestingly, instead of dubbing, Nirahua enacted every scene in the five languages that the movie is made in — Hindi, Telugu,  ,Tamil and Bengali. 
 
 Directed by Iqbal Baksh and produced by Ramesh Vyas, the film is the story of a brave warrior, Mahabali.
