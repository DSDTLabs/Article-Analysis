While the Tamil version of   continues to receive flak for affecting ‘Tamil sensibilities’, the Telugu version of the reality TV show seems to be going in the same direction even before its release.

 The promo for the show was recently released and it had the show’s host   peeping through a hole in the wall at the contestants living inside. Ramakrishna, the Chairman of the Telangana Film Chamber of Commerce has made his displeasure known and urged Jr NTR to stay away from the show.
 
 A self-professed NTR and Jr NTR fan, the Chairman believes the show will not click as it goes against ‘Telugu sensibilities’. He stated that several stars were approached to be the participants of the show but they all denied because the show goes against our culture. He said, "We are asking NTR not to do this show as peeping into the holes and looking at the legs of girls is not what we should encourage all the way. This is against Indian culture and Hindu culture." 
 
 While the show might be seeped in controversy after its release, just like all its counterparts are, for now, fans look forward to the release. The show hit the small screen on Sunday, June 16, 2017, at 9 PM.
