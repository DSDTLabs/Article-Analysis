Such anomalies would not just cause distress to the affected people, but would also raise doubts about the efficiency of the officials who prepared the list,’’ Kanagaraj told reporters.

Meanwhile, we would immediately collect a fresh application from the MLA and include the names in the voters list,’’ said the official.
