NEW DELHI:   leader M   accused   on Wednesday of blocking passage of the 
  (GST) bill when UPA was in power, causing a loss of over Rs 12 lakh crore to the country. He alleged that the government had subverted   by bringing legislations to the Lower House as money bills.

 Soon after finance minister   introduced four bills in   to give effect to the goods and services tax (GST), Moily exhorted Rajya Sabha members to resign if they had any pride left.
 
 “It is the biggest step in federal law, federal finances. You are a representative of the council of states. Finance minister, you are denying rights to yourself,” Moily said, pointing towards Jaitley, a Rajya Sabha member.
 
 “Today, we are happy that there is a big, I won’t say brute, majority here. I won’t say bulldozing because Mr Venkaiah Naidu said don’t use that word. (There is) nothing wrong, you have the right, you feel personally you have the right to do it, deprive Rajya Sabha,” the Congress leader said.
 
 “Otherwise, what is the point in having council of states, they don’t have a voice to demonstrate the assault on the federal structure of the country. If they have some pride, all of them should resign,” he added.
 
 Moily said when BJP was in opposition, it put hurdles in the way of the  , leading to loss of Rs 12 lakh crore. “The country has faced around Rs 12 lakh crore loss because of delay in implementing the GST bill. More than seven to eight years have passed,” Moily said.
 
 BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab aired his reservations regarding the move to bring agriculturists in the tax net. TMC’s Kalyan Banerjee said the West Bengal government had supported the “path-breaking” GST legislation but expressed concern over the government’s hurry in its implementation.
