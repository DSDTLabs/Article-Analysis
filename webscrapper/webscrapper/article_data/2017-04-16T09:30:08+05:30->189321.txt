MADURAI: Though the 45-day   is aimed at conserving fish species and improving breeding, fishermen along the coast said that they have not witnessed any significant improvement in the past.

 The fishermen also questioned the timing of the ban. “Our fishermen have brought fish with eggs even during October and November. Considering the tropical climate of our coast, we are doubtful if fish breed during these summer months of April and May,” said U  , a fishermen activist from Pamban. He said that the government should have consulted the fishermen along with scientists before charting out the fishing ban period along the coasts. 
 
 Aruanandam said that the ban has failed to yield desired results as fishing boats from the western coast of Tamil Nadu poach into the eastern coast during the ban period. “Fishing ban is implemented in two slots in Kanyakumari district on the east and west coasts and poaching is common. Fisheries officials should come out with better plans to curb such poaching during the breeding season,” said A Sahayam, president of mechanised fishermen association at   harbour in Kanyakumari district. 
 
 Mechanised trawler fishermen also alleged that country boats have evolved into relatively big crafts in recent years. These boats too have all sort of fishing gear and equipment and sail farther into the sea for multi-day fishing. Hence curtailing mechanized boats alone will not yield expected desired results, fishermen said.
