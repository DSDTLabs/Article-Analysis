LUCKNOW: After annexe building and bungalows of ministers, now boundary walls of   parks are getting a saffron coat. Though LMC has denied issuing any order to paint walls of parks maintained by it in saffron, one such park in Viramkhand, Gomtinagar got a saffron coat recently.

 LMC executive engineer   told TOI that the intention was to paint park walls in green and orange, the combination of colours used in Swachh Bharat logo to promote the Swachchata Mission. “The park was in a dilapidated state and the colour of its boundary wall had faded. It’s original colour was a light tinge of orange. So, we decided to colour it in  . While walls were planned to be painted in orange, the railings were to be green.”
 
 The matter came to notice when locals opposed the repainting of walls in a different colour. They claimed that the wall’s original colour was light yellow.
 
 Notably, a lot of renovation is going on in the city with dividers being re-painted, roads being strengthened and parks being beautified ahead of the UP Investors’ Summit 2018.
 
 “There is no order from the government to  . This is a baseless allegation,” said municipal commissioner Uday Raj Singh.
