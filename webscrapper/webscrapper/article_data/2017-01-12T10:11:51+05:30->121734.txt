 We are going to review our national sports development code so that federations will have guidelines which will have to be followed. Although we respect the charter of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the autonomy of the IOA, they also have accountability and transparent.
 
 
 
 
 Yes, we want the states to comply with the sports code. When we met the federations, one of the points which were agreed upon is that the state associations will also follow the code.
