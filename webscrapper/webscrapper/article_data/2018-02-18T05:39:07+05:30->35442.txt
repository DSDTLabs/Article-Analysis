CHENNAI: Ever since his revolt in February last, against the domination of   family, and launch of his 'dharmayudh', OPS along with his supporters got to meet Modi at will. :

 The frequency of these meetings kept tongues wagging that it was the Prime Minister and the BJP leaders who were controlling the AIADMK. But then, both the AIADMK as well as the BJP denied that Modi had any hand in the affairs of the party or the state government, after the death of J Jayalalithaa. OPS's latest confession strengthens the popular belief.
 
 Reacting to the revelation by OPS, senior minister   said the "suggestion" could have been made during a one-on-one meeting between Modi and OPS. "The party welcomes anyone making suggestions for the AIADMK's well-being," Jayakumar told reporters here on Saturday.
 
 Dairy development minister KT Rajenthira Balaji sought to brush aside the whole issue saying that the deputy CM might have said this in a lighter vein and denied any connection between the AIADMK and the Prime Minister. 
 
 Interestingly, a few months ago, it was Rajenthira Balaji who said, while addressing a party meeting, that "Modi is there to take care of us." BJP state president   said she did not have the right to comment on what the Prime Minister might have said. "  might have given a suggestion or there could have been an exchange of ideas. OPS is the best person to reveal more details on this," she said.
 
 Analysts say OPS's comment is a message to the AIADMK cadres that he has the support of Modi. "Presently OPS may be lying low not to shake the government, but this is not permanent and during election, he might woo more cadres towards him to reclaim the leadership role," said political analyst Badri Seshadri.
