Like what they did to Rohit Vemula and  , they are out to rob the voice and the future of every Indian. Modi has become an emperor without clothes, but nobody is willing to tell him that. India’s freedom was handed over to the British by a few Indians. Modi and the RSS are trying to rob you of the same freedom.”
  
  Civil rights activist  , who was invited for the function, drew parallels between US President Donald Trump and Modi and alleged that both had unleashed “ferocious animosity” which had to be countered by the people by rising up against it.
