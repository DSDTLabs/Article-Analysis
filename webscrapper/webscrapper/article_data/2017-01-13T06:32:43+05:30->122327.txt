GHAZIABAD: A van with Rs 3 crore in cash was seized near UP Gate on Thursday morning, sending the police and the district administration here in a tizzy. 

 However, it turned out that the money was meant to be deposited in a bank and had little to do with any of the assembly election candidates in the fray.
 
 The policemen, who seized the van said that even though it was bank money that was being ferried, it gave room for suspicion as bank protocol was not followed. The matter has been referred to the income tax department, they said.
