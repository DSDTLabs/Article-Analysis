When lyricist-director   Kumar embarked on his second directorial, he wanted the project to reflect grandiose in all aspects of the filmmaking, to truly embody its title,  . The film, produced by RS Productions, took a while to be made, but Chetan considers the fact that it is hitting theatres today, his first victory. Here, he tells us what makes the   Sarja-starrer a must-watch this week.
* The film begins with a narrative by Challenging Star Darshan, which sets the tone for the story, and the hero’s introduction.
 * Bharjari is a complete family entertainer and will appeal to Dhruva’s fans who have been looking forward to his next outing after Addhuri and Bahaddur. In fact, the first half will play to the gallery and appease his fans, with the story taking off in the second half.
 * The theme of the film is that Dhruva is destiny’s child. The twists in his story will leave audiences surprised. In fact, the villain in the film is fate and how it affects his life.
 * The characterization for each person on the cast, especially for Dhruva, is such that audiences will relate to them at some level. 
 * Audiences who have seen Dhruva’s progression as an artiste from Addhuri to Bahaddur will see his star presence raised with Bharjari.
 * The film is not only about him. There are three lovely ladies in the tale — Rachita Ram, Hariprriya and Vaishali Deepak — each of whom add a dimension to the narrative. In fact, the love story is pegged on the concept of a dimple, and, considering that all three are dimpled beauties, it would be interesting to see how the tale progresses.
 * The music by V Harikrishna has been widely appreciated, with Bharjari Soundu and Puttu Gowri notching up multi-million views online. Choreographer A Harsha’s work on these songs is a bonus.
 * Cinematography by Shreesha Kuduvalli, who worked on Bahaddur as well, elevates the project and makes it a visual treat.
