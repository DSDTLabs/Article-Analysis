Singer   says she is bitten by the acting bug. 

 But the "Cool For The Summer" hitmaker thinks it would be more difficult for her to return to acting now she has so many permanent inkings, reported Entertainment Tonight.
 
 "I did get bit by the acting bug a little bit (working on "Smurfs: The Lost Village"), but I think I started thinking about it the other day, about wanting to go back into acting.
 
 "I think I have too many tattoos now. You'd have to cover all my tattoos up and it would take forever," Lovato said. 
 
 The 24-year-old singer said she enjoyed dubbing for the film more as she did not have to worry about hair and make up. 
 
 "I was able to act and not be in front of a camera, which was really nice. I didn't have to go through hair and make up, and I didn't have to worry about my camera angles and what not. 
 
 "So, it was nice to be as animated as I wanted to be, play with my voice and to just have fun with it. It's very exciting for me to play such an iconic character, and to be a part of such a classic and timeless franchise.
