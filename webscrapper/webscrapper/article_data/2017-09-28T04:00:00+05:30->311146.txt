 Mirza has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding justice for thousands of account holders and 140 employees of the cooperative bank by speeding up the trial, which is pending since 14 years against Patel, who he alleged was the main defaulter.
 
 Addressing media persons on Wednesday, Paatil said, “I had borrowed Rs 47 crore from the bank. In the one-time settlement scheme of the state government, I have repaid Rs 87 crore with 8 per cent interest.” 
 
 “I have been made a personal target by Mirza. He lost the VNSGU syndicate election against our candidate and now he is trying to take revenge by making such false allegations.” 
 
 Asked about the bank depositors, Paatil said, “All the depositors have received their hard-earned money with interest. Though the bank is in liquidation, it still has deposits of Rs 50 crore. I have proposed to the district collector to revive the bank once again.”
