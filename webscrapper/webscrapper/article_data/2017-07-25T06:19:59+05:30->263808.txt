NEW DELHI:  , who quit as head of  's FMCG business, is set to join   India as chief operating officer (COO) of the retailer's merchandising, marketing and omnichannel business.

 Chawla will report to Walmart India CEO Krish Iyer, said people familiar with the development. A Walmart India spokesperson declined to comment. With Walmart's retailer development model `mera Kirana program' (to transform small Kiranas to help them serve their customers better) gathering steam, it is expected that Chawla's expertise in food retail will help the global retail giant beef up its cashand-carry business here.
 
 In addition, Chawla may play a bigger role at Walmart India, if the government eases FDI norms in food retail and allows foreign retailers to sell 25% of non-food items of the total goods sold.
 
 PM  's meeting with Walmart president & CEO Doug Mcmillon during his recent US visit has provided a new impetus in hiring top talent here in India, said senior industry executives.
 
 Before joining Future Group as CEO of its private label brands in 2009, Chawla, an alumnus of Symbiosis Institute of Business Management in Pune, worked at Reliance Retail, Coca-Cola and Asian Paints.He resigned earlier this month as CEO of Future Consumer, barely six months after taking over the role.
