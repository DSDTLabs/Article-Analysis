PATNA: As the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre is about to complete three years in power this month, the state JD(U) on Saturday made a frontal attack on Prime Minister  , accusing him of failing to create government jobs. “There has been a drastic fall in central government jobs in the country under the Modi government,” the party said.

 Citing the reply given by minister of state in PMO Jitendra   to a question in the Lok Sabha on March 29 this year, JD(U) spokesmen Sanjay Singh, Neeraj Kumar and   said there were 1,51,841 employees in the central government in 2013, but the strength had come down to 15,897 in 2015 – a fall by 89%. “Similarly, jobs for the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and other backward caste categories have fallen by 90%,” they said.
 
 Singh said PM Narendra Modi, in his poll speeches, had promised to create two crore jobs per year for unemployed persons in the country, but failed to make even direct recruitment of the unemployed in central government jobs through the formal recruitment process. “There is a wide gap between the promises he made and their execution,” Singh said, adding only 12,000 jobs have been created in the manufacturing sector despite the central government launching twin programmes of Make in India and Skill India for this sector.
 
 Prasad said in 2009, jobs had been created for 12.56 lakh people, but the figure in 2015 stood at just 1.35 lakh. He said jobs in construction, cable, diamond and jewellery, engineering and healthcare sectors fell by 43.7%, 20.6%, 28.4%, 26.4% and 20.5%, respectively, in 2015. “The monthly income of 68% of families is not more than Rs 10,000 in the country,” he added.
