MYSURU: A slew of awareness initiatives, coupled with increased citizen participation, has helped   bag the ' ' tag among cities with a population of three to 10 lakh. 

 The city has come on top of the rankings in this category for the fourth consecutive year under   2018.
 
 The Swachh Survekshan team led by observers   and ME   visited Mysuru in February, and took a close look at the cleanliness drives initiated by the civic agencies, and verified all documents pertaining to projects undertaken to keep the city clean. 
 
 
 
 
 The Swachh Survekshan team also collected feedback from the citizens, and conducted a survey to check whether Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) had initiated door-to-door waste collection, started waste-to-compost conversion units, set up individual and public toilets, among other measures.
 
 In the three years that the central government has carried out the Swachh Survekshan, Mysuru emerged on top in the first two years but dropped to fifth slot last year. MCC initiated campaigns involving institutions, NGOs, resident welfare associations and getting celebrities to endorse its initiatives. Among those roped in by the civic body to promote its initiatives were cricketer Javagal Srinath, scion of the Mysuru royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Wadiyar, and Pramoda Devi Wadiyar.
