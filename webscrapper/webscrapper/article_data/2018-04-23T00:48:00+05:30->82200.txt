Tirupur: An all-party meeting conducted on Saturday to settle a dispute concerning the functioning of a mosque in the city has sought the intervention of the district administration and the police department.

 Some Hindu outfits had demanded the closure of the mosque, which had been functioning in a residential area in Mahalakshmi Nagar in 15 Velampalayam for the last four years, alleging that it was causing disturbance in the locality. They had preferred a writ petition before the Madras high court.
 
 To find an amicable solution, All Islam Jamad Federation called the meeting, which was conducted in a hotel on Kangeyam Road. Leaders of DMK, Congress, CPM, CPI, DMDK, Naam Tamilar Katchi, TMMK and Indian Muslim League attended it.
 
 DMK Tirupur north district president and former mayor K Selvaraj stressed on the need to maintain social harmony. “The district administration should intervene in the issue and hear what the local residents have to say about it before taking any decision. All parties have decided to meet the collector and the city police commissioner soon,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, a Hindu Munnani functionary said the mosque authorities had not obtained the necessary permission from the corporation. “It has become a nuisance in the residential area. The HC had directed to close it. But, the order was challenged,” he said.
