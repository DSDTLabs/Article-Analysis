BENGALURU: In a big setback for  , sitting Independent MLA from Mulbagal (SC) constituency in Kolar district, the Karnataka high court on Wednesday set aside his election in the 2013 assembly polls.

 The order means Manjunath cannot rely on the caste certificate and contest from the same constituency again in the present election. “The caste certificate relied upon by Manjunatha is got by fraud and as such he is not qualified to contest from the constituency reserved for Scheduled Caste,” Justice A S Bopanna has observed in his order. The court has said that Manjunath belongs to Byragi caste and he has failed to establish that he belongs to   (Budaga) Jangama caste coming under SC category. The court also fined him Rs 25,000.
 
 The   now finds itself in an embarrassing situation as the party is left with no candidate in the constituency.
 
 The Congress had given the ticket to Manjunath as he had contested as a rebel and won in 2013. While the case dragged on, Manjunath continued to remain an Independent MLA of Mulbagal. With elections approaching, Congress decided to induct Manjunath into the party fold.
 
 Now, the Congress is left with no official candidate from the constituency. Amidst this, Congress MP representing Kolar K H Muniyappa’s daughter M Nandini had filed her nominations papers from Mulbagal as an independent.
 
 With the last date of filing nominations completed, and the party unable to find a replacement, it is said the Congress may now extend its support to Nandini. Muniyappa’s eldest daughter Roopa Shashidhar is contesting from Kolar Gold Fields ( ) against   candidate Y Ashwini, daughter of former MLA Y Sampangi.
