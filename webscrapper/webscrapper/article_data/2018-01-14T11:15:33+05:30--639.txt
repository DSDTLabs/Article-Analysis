NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Saturday challenged India to "test our resolve" over a  , in response to Army chief General  's remarks from Friday.

 "Very irresponsible statement by Indian Army Chief,not befitting his office. Amounts to invitation for nuclear encounter.If that is what they desire,they are welcome to test our resolve.The general's doubt would swiftly be removed, inshallah," tweeted Pakistan's foreign minister  .
 
  
  
 The neighbouring country's foreign office, too, was at pains to clarify that "Pakistan is fully capable of defending itself," in a series of tweets from its spokesperson.
 
  
  
 
  
  
 Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor, the official spokesperson for Pakistan's armed forces, claimed that his country has "credible nuclear deterrence" against threats from India.
 
 "Pakistan has credible nuclear deterrence against any threat from India. We are a professional army, responsible nuclear state and resilient nation and India must not remain in illusion," he said.
 
  
  
 
 While addressing the press in the run-up to Army Day, Gen Rawat had called out "Pakistan's nuclear bogey," saying it will be thoroughly exposed if the situation escalates to a war.
 
 Pakistan often brandishes its short-range Nasr (Hatf-IX) nuclear missiles as a battlefield counter to India's 'Cold Start' strategy which focusses on 'limited' and 'calibrated' strikes to make swift and hard inroads into enemy territory.
 
 "We will call their bluff. If given the task, we will not say we cannot cross the border because they have nuclear weapons," he had said.
