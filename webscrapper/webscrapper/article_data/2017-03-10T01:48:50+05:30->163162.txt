THANE:   resident N Kature, who was worried about his son’s school admission could finally breath a sigh of relief after his five year old’s admission application was selected in all the four schools he had applied for in the first lottery round of the   (RTE) process on Monday.

 Out of a 29,142   in   this year, 11,115 were selected in the first round of the lottery system on Monday. On March 9, as many as 89 students secured admission under the RTE Act in Thane district.
 
 “I couldn’t afford the increasing fees that the good schools these days have. But at the same time I wanted my son to receive good education. So, I applied in the under the 25% RTE quota which is reserved for the economically weaker section. I included good schools like DAV, Saraswati, Orchid and St. Mary’s in my list of preferences and was over the moon when my son’s name showed up on all the school’s lists,” Kature said.
 
 Once the selection lists were released on Tuesday, the parents of the applicants were sent an SMS informing them about the news. There was a bee line in front of all the schools to complete the admission process.
 
 As the number of selected applications, which add up to 11, 115, has increased by almost 4,000 as compared to last year’s 7,337 , district education officials peg the rise in these numbers to the extra efforts they have taken this year.
 
 “We have taken additional steps this year to ensure that parents are in the loop of the entire process and have submitted their documents properly. We have also set up a number of help desks to guide them and have organised workshops in each block in the district. We have even put advertisements in the newspapers. Besides, parents were also informed through a text message,” said an official at the Thane ZP.
 
 The selected students will have to visit their school and complete the admission procedure by March 15.
