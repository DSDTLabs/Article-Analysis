NEW DELHI:   on Monday alleged that the   had fraudulently   an  . The department, however, claimed that the permit had been cancelled after it came to light that an imposter had secured it using forged documents.

 Alleging corruption in the Delhi government department, Anupam, Swaraj India’s Delhi unit president, said many such permits had been issued by the authority. According to Swaraj India, Chhotelal had died in 2011 and his permit was transferred to another person without the knowledge of the driver’s family. The permit could have been transferred in a family member’s name on the basis of the survivor’s documents.
 
 Shanti Devi, mother of the deceased, said she had approached the officials concerned but to no avail. Swaraj India pointed out that it had moved court demanding an investigation as the department didn’t take any action. An FIR was finally filed on February 7 at Burari police station against officials, including the motor licensing officer (MLO) of the auto rickshaw unit in Burari. However, nobody has been arrested though they are booked on non-bailable offences, claimed Anupam. The transfer documents in this case have the photograph of an unknown person shown as Chhotelal. 
 
 Countering the allegation, MLO Rajesh Meena said the permit had been cancelled and there was no collusion of any transport official with the imposter. “In such cases, we look at all documents, including the registration and fitness certificates, and the address proof. In this case, an imposter had turned up with all documents, including the original voter card,” Meena told TOI.
 
 After Shanti Devi’s complaint, he said, a showcause notice was sent to the imposter and the permit was cancelled. “We have asked Shanti Devi to bring a legal heir of Chhotelal along with all documents.” A department official said Meena had already requested the police in writing to register a case of fraud.
