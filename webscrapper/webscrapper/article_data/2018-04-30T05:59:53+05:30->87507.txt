NEW DELHI: Indian and Pakistani combat troops, who are locked in a volatile confrontation with daily firing duels along the Line of Control in J&K, will for the first time exercise together as part of a multi-nation counter-terror war game under the aegis of the   (SCO) in Russia in August.

 
 The exercise ' ', which will also see the participation of China and other SCO countries, is slated to be held in the Chelyabinsk region of Russia from August 22 to 29. "Indian soldiers have never actively participated in a multilateral exercise that included Pakistan in the past. Troops from the two countries have, however, worked together in UN missions and operations," an officer said.
 
 The main aim of the exercise, being conducted under the framework of the SCO's Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS), which is headquartered in Tashkent (Uzbekistan), will be on bolstering counter-terror cooperation among the member countries. "It will see joint mock drills to eliminate terrorists and their networks, and interventions in hostage situations," he said.
 
 "India's participation in the exercise was confirmed by defence minister   during a meeting of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation defence ministers in Beijing last week. India joined the SCO in June 2017. The level of participation for the exercise is yet to be decided," the officer said.
 
 The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation was constituted in 2001 by China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan. Now, the grouping has eight full members, including India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan. Another four nations have been accorded 'observer' status, while six others are 'dialogue' partners.
