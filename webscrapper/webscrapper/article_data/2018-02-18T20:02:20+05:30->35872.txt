Last night saw a number of Bollywood stars under one roof as they turned up to attend director   and Anaita Shroff Adajania's son's Navjote ceremony.

 Bollywood celebs like  , Nimrat Kaur, Diana Penty, Jim Sarbh and power couples   and  , Ratna Pathak Shah and   graced the event. 
 
 The highlight of the night had to be Kareena, who made her appearance in a mint green Anarkali dress with golden embroidery. She completed her look with smoky eye makeup and heavy golden earrings which were more than enough to make her the centre of attraction at the celebrations last night.
 
 While Twinkle and Akshay kept it casual, Diana and Nimrat turned up looking elegant in sarees.
 
 Here are a few pictures of the Bollywood celebrities at the Navjote last night.
