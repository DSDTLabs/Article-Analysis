AMRITSAR: Union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj’s statement in the   on the whereabouts of the 39 abducted Indian youths in the Iraqi city of  , have dented the hopes of their kin who believed they were alive and would return home after the fall of the Islamic State (IS). 

 “In one of our meetings, Swaraj had informed us that she was told by the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas that all the 39 Indians were alive. Now she says that she doesn’t know whether they are alive or dead,” said Gurpinder Kaur whose brother Manjinder Singh was among the abducted youths.
 
 On Wednesday, Sushma had stated in the parliament that during her 12 meetings with the families of abducted youths she had categorically told them her information was based on other sources and the Indian government didn’t have any direct contact with them. She also stated that she would meet the families only if she had some credible proof of the fate of the 39 Indians.
 
 “We will not believe her any more about the fate of our children unless one of them himself calls back home,” said Malkit Ram, from Ludhiana, whose brother Nand Lal was also among the Indians abducted by IS in June 2014.
 
 Gurpinder claimed that during their meeting with Sushma on June 8, they were told that their kin were lodged in Al Shareen church in Mosul. “Why were we being misled? Instead of giving us unconfirmed news about our relatives, the government should have simply said it had no information,”she said.
 
 After hearing Sushma, a shell-shocked Seema, wife of one of the missing Indians Sonu, said, “Our limit is to approach the concerned minister and we did that. We never knew that we will be fooled on such a sensitive issue.”
