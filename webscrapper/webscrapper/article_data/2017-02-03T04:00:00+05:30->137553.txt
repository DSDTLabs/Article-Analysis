Rajkot: The Congress-ruled Amreli district panchayat has passed a resolution condemning the suspension of Ambardi government school principal Prakash Davda and slammed district collector Dileep Kumar Rana for allegedly pressurizing the panchayat’s education staff to take action against him at the behest of the state government.

 On January 21, government had suspended Davda after villagers had protested against demonetization during Gunotsav, the drive to assess the quality of education in state-run schools.
 
 People of Ambardi had opposed 'Gunotsav' by sitting in the classrooms with placards reading ‘Teach us how to live without money’ when government officials came for assessment. Moreover, villagers also did not send their children to school and instead asked them to stand in bank queues to withdraw cash. 
 
 Government officers had to return as there were no students in the school. Davda was suspended for not following orders from his higher office to file a police complaint against the villagers for obstructing school work. However, Davda did not do so. He was suspended for dereliction of duty and not adhering to orders from the higher office. During suspension, Davda has been posted at a primary school in the coastal Chanch village.
 
 “Collector has no role district panchayat’s affairs and he has encroached upon the panchayat’s autonomy. We have a taken serious note of it and passed a resolution to approach the court against it,’’said Ramila Malani, chairman of the panchayat’s education committee.
 
 “We have also passed resolution to withdraw the suspension of the innocent principal. Collector had consistently pressurized education staff through oral orders and got him suspended. This is has set a very bad precedent,” Malani said.
