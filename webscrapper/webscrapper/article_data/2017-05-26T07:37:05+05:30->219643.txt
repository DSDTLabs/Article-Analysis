LUCKNOW: A ‘gang’ of three children was nabbed by police for stealing   on Wednesday.

 According to the police, the children, all boys, were aged eight, nine and 14. They were arrested on an informer’s tip off from   and sent to a juvenile home. 
 
 The trio hailed from Koderma district in Jharkhand. The police recovered 100 mobile phones worth Rs 15 lakh from a house where they were staying in Bhimnagar, Ujariyaon in Gomtinagar.
 
 ASP (north) Anurag Vats said the three children were brought from Koderma on the pretext of free food and study but forced into mobile phone  . They were provided a training for five days when they reached Lucknow and then sent to markets and public places to steal mobiles.
 
 “They had a very unique way of stealing. They used to place a plain white paper in front of their pockets and then steal phones. They used to wear expensive looking clothes so that they did not draw suspicion,” Vats told TOI.
 
 He also said that their parents were given Rs 5,000 to let them go. After 10-15 thefts they were sent to another city to commit the same crime. They have even been sent to as far as New Delhi to steal phones.
 
 Sources in the police department said the children were lured by one Sunil, who is currently missing.   allegedly brings children from West Bengal and Bihar to force them into crime. 
 
 SHO Gomtinagar AK Tripathi said the miscreants will be sent to a juvenile court for further legal procedures.
