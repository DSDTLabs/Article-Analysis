Trichy: Condemning the state government for the steep hike in bus ticket fares, cadres attached to Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) staged a different protest by submitting a petition seeking rollback of bus fare hike to two donkeys in Srirangam on Tuesday.  According to protesters, it is said that college students hailing from underprivileged families in Ariyalur and Perambalur districts, studying in various colleges across the city have been struggling since the bus fares were hiked by 50-60 per cent.  The protesters brought a couple of donkeys to the venue and hanged a board on each of them signifying the animals as Tamil Nadu government and representatives of the government. Subsequently, a copy of petition demanding rollback of hiked bus ticket fare was submitted to the donkeys. TNN
