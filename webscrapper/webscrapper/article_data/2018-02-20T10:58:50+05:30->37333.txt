KOCHI: Immigration officers at   were shocked when Pakistani national  , who had cleared the immigration at  , arrived here with an invalid visa on Sunday. A senior officer with the bureau of immigration said that Memon had entered the country with a visa that only permitted Mumbai as the port of entry. 

 The department immediately informed  , who boarded him on the next flight back to the Sharjah. "He arrived on Air Arabia (G9 427) flight at 6:10 pm and was sent back on the next Air Arabia (G9 428) to Sharjah at 7:30pm," said a source.
 
 He added that Memon fully cooperated during the entire process and boarded the flight without creating a scene. The businessman did not create a security concern at the airport as he did not raise red flags with the immigration department or CISF.
 
 "Usually we come across people here with an invalid visa from the United States or   once in two days. But a Pakistani national arriving here with an invalid visa is unusual. Such errors happen when the immigration personnel at the country of origin are not aware of the conditions of immigration," said the source.
 
 He added that in most cases the port of entry for Pakistanis are Delhi or Mumbai. If such a traveller wants to enter via Kochi, it would be permitted under special consideration of the immigration department. But, this has to be done in advance.
