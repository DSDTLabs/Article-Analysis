PATNA: Nalanda University’s newly appointed   said on Friday that opening two new schools — the   and School of International Relations and Peace Studies — would be among her initial priorities. 

 Sunaina was appointed the NU VC by President Pranab Mukherjee in his capacity as Visitor to the varsity. She took charge on May 15. 
 
 Talking to mediapersons at Rajgir on Friday morning, Sunaina said she envisioned NU as an intellectual bridge between India and Asia as well as   countries.
 
 She said she would strive to build Nalanda as an icon of Asian Renaissance. Her roadmap for the purpose will focus on five major areas: Expansion of departments and schools, streamlining administration, improving infrastructure, capacity building and library enrichment.
 
 “We need to build more schools and departments for academic excellence. The School of Linguistics and Literature and the School of International Relations and Peace Studies will be the next schools to open. We will create new departments in the existing schools. In the School of Buddhist Studies, Philosophy and Comparative Religions, for instance, we plan to introduce Vedic Studies, Indian Spiritual Tradition and Peace Studies,” she said.
 
 On the infrastructure at the varsity, Sunaina said it would be developed in keeping with the image of an international varsity. “The construction work on the main campus is on in full swing. We hope we will hold some classes on the main campus soon. We will also get prefab structures,” Sunaina said, adding a monitoring committee would be set up to expedite the construction work.
 
 The VC said the varsity might soon launch certain short-term executive programmes on subjects like mindfulness and yoga.
