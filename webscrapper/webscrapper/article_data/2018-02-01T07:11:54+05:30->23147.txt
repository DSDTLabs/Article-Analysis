KOLKATA: For over five hours on Wednesday evening, most   kept their eyes on the sky. On a roof in Dhakuria, where more than 250 people had been waiting for the rare phenomenon of a super blue blood moon eclipse, a loud cry went up a little after 6.21pm when a hint of faint red appeared on the eastern sky. The eclipse started at 5.08pm, but it wasn’t visible.

 The Sky Watchers’ Association, a group of amateur astronomers, had invited astronomy enthusiasts to view the celestial phenomenon from the terrace of a highrise in Dhakuria. The viewing, however, was not easy for inexperienced eyes. Many had arranged to be at vantage points from 5pm, when the eclipse started, could not spot the moon because it was not as prominent as on other days.
 
 “The contours were merged with the clouds, which made it difficult to spot. But anybody who focused towards the eastern side of the sky could see it easily,” said Soumendra Basu of Sky Watchers’ Association. “It is a rare phenomenon which was probably last seen more than a quarter century ago. The super blue moon is passing through the earth's shadow to cause a total lunar eclipse. And the moon has taken a reddish tint, becoming a blood moon.”
 
  and her family was on the terrace of her Sir Hari Ram Goenka Street since 4pm to observe “the rare phenomenon”.
 
 “I am seeing such a thing for the first time in my life,” said the post-graduate student.
 
  in   could not spot the moon at first. “My friends in other parts of the city said they could spot it, but I could not. Finally, after 7pm, I could see the contours a little,” she said.
 
 The eclipse occurred in several phases over five hours. The partial eclipse started at 5.08am, but it was not visible in most parts of the city due to haze and highrises. The wait got over when the total eclipse started at 6.21pm. The maximum eclipse happened after 6.59pm. The total eclipse happened at 7.37pm and the partial eclipse ended at 8.41. The penumbral eclipse ended at 9.38pm.
