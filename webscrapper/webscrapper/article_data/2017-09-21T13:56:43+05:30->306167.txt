NAGPUR: Vice-chancellor of Nagpur   SP Kane, who is leaving for a 10-day personal tour to United Kingdom on Thursday, will visit   (UoP) to finalize the faculty exchange programme.

 TOI was the first to report on December 2, 2016 about the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the NU and UoP. As per the MoU, three associate professors would be selected by the NU and sent for conducting research at Portsmouth. Similarly, postgraduate students too would be able to complete their final semester in UoP.
 
 Kane said, “Portsmouth is an hour’s drive from where I would be staying. So, I decided to visit the university and finalize the process to start faculty and  .”
 
 He said the NU has already initiated the process for faculty members and a circular will be issued soon. “The scheme is limited to teachers of university postgraduate departments. We plan to send the first batch either in January or February. This time, it would be for three weeks only. Later, the stay can be extended to three months,” he said.
 
 Kane said he also plans to include the student exchange programme in the syllabus with an option for meritorious students to complete their final semester there. “But, 50% cost will have to be borne by the students,” he added.
