Nagpur: New Era Hospital has become the first hospital in the city and the region to get permission to perform heart transplants. It was also the first to get a liver transplant license, and has already conducted two liver transplants in the last four days. Cardiac surgeon Dr Anand Sancheti told reporters that for initial few transplants Dr Manoj Durairaj from Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, and Dr Dhawal Naik from CIIMS Hospital, Ahmedabad, will be there for the transplant. “Once all our staff and doctors are trained in fully handling the transplant, we will take off on our own,” he said. Dr Sancheti, who has trained at Royal Northshore Hospital, Sydney, and Apollo Hospital, Chennai, said that compared to liver transplant the heart transplant is comparatively easier. The success rate in heart transplants is almost 90% and survival rate is 10-12 years. “The hospital already has three patients on the waiting list. Of these, two are from Madhya Pradesh. The basic procedure may cost anything between Rs10-15 lakh, which is much cheaper than liver transplant,” he said. The cardiac team, besides Dr Sancheti, includes interventional cardiologist Dr Nidheesh Mishra and cardiologist Dr Kirti Tanna, who is also one of the hospital directors, and anaesthesiologists Dr Sahil Bansal and Dr Savita Jaiswal. Dr Mishra is running a heart failure clinic to identify patients for transplant. Neurosurgeon Dr Nilesh Agrawal and another director, intensivist Dr Amol Kokas, were also present on the occasion. Dr Agrawal said that the hospital already has the required infrastructure, like three positive pressure rooms in ICU, two dialysis machines, ECMO or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Machines, nitric oxide delivery system in ventilators, cardiac biopsy facility in cath lab, and positive pressure rooms in the ward. The hospital has a brain death declaration committee consisting of Dr Archana Sancheti, Dr Nilesh Agrawal, Dr Vivel Agrawal, Dr Parag Moon, Dr Pankaj Dhoble, and Dr Kirti Tanna.
