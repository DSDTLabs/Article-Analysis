NEW DELHI: Markets opened lower on Monday with BSE   down by over 112 points at 33,898.74 while the broader NSE   trading below the 10,450-mark. 

 
 
 As of 12:58 pm, the Sensex was down 376 points to trade below the 34,000-mark at 33,634. Nifty also remained in the lower circuit with trading below the 10,350-mark.
 
 The 30-share barometer dropped by 130.54 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 33,880.22 in early trade led by fall in Tata Steel, SBI, Reliance Industries and L&T. The Nifty index also fell 47.40 points, or 0.45 per cent, at 10,404.90. Brokers said investors trimmed positions on distinctly weak sentiment since the detection of a massive Rs 11,400-crore fraud at state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB). Shares PNB remained under selling pressure and lost another 5.25 per cent.
 
 On Friday, both the indices ended flat for the week. The Sensex rose marginally by 5 points, or 0.01 per cent, while the Nifty slipped by 2.65 points, or 0.02 per cent.
 
 "Market slid despite a positive trend in global market. The alleged fraud in PNB dented investors' optimism on banks and they expect that the scam may extend to some other banks.
 
 "Further, India's trade deficit which widened in the month of January and rising bond yields are likely to add volatility in the near term," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.
 
 Sentiment turned weak after the country's trade gap soared to $16.3 billion in January on account of a 26.1 per cent increase in imports to $40.68 billion due to increased inbound shipments of crude oil, as per data released by the commerce ministry.
