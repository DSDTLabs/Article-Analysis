NOIDA: The   who had strangled a dog under his feet in Sadarpur Bazar in Noida was   by the police on Tuesday. An FIR was registered against   (48), an  , who himself reached the Sector 39 police station in an attempt to pre-empt trouble.

 On why Singh was only questioned on the brutal killing of the stray dog and was not arrested, the police said the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, “did not necessarily mandate arrest”.
 
 “The mongrel was killed in a brutal manner. The police should have arrested the accused and sent him to jail. Instead, they only questioned him and allowed him to go. We are not satisfied with the development,” said  , founder of local animal rights organisation Fauna Police.
 
 DSP Abhinandan, circle officer-1, said that a case has been registered against the accused under sections 428 (killing an animal) and 429 (killing cattle) of IPC, and Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. “We have started the legal procedure against the accused. We have served him notices and his statements will be recorded. We will prepare a chargesheet and produce him in court,” he said.
 
 A traffic police officer told TOI that Singh was off duty on Friday and was in uniform as he was on duty before going to the market. “He was on his way home when a stray dog barked at him. In self-defence, the traffic marshal stepped on the dog and killed it,” he said. The killing of the dog occurred near Sadarpur Bazar in Sector 45, on July 14.
