After four days of rest, savouring their first win of this year’s  , the   will be raring to get on the field again. They will be playing the Rajasthan team which has lost some momentum it had at the start of the tournament. This ebb and flow of form and momentum is what makes the tournament such an interesting one. Nobody can be certain how the game is going to pan out on the day.

 
 
 
 For Mumbai,  's return to form meant they put up a near impossible score for the Bangalore boys to chase. With his incredible ability to hit the ball into the stands even as he looks to be merely caressing the ball, the Mumbai skipper is virtually unstoppable. There are few better sights in cricket than Rohit in full flow. Evin Lewis has given Mumbai Indians great starts and he needed someone to be the finisher for Mumbai and that's what Rohit will need to do now.
 
 
 
 Kieron Pollard is due for a big score as also the Pandya brothers. If Ishaan Kishan, who took a nasty blow on his face is not fit, then Krunal can come up the order. Mayank Markande tasted a bit of hammering in the previous game but came back well and he will again be the key bowler once the field restrictions are removed. Jasprit Bumrah too is getting his rhythm back but Mustafizir Rahman is not quite the bowler he was a couple of years back.
 
  
  
 CSK stormed back to winning ways with Watson’s hundred and they will be hoping to keep the rhythm going against the Sunrisers who stumbled to their first loss after ‘Gaylestorm’ hit them. Sunrisers will be hoping for Dhawan to be fit for he is the man in form and has been batting brilliantly. Rashid was hit by Gayle but he will come back stronger as he is a quick learner. Teams batting first are winning games and that will make the captains pick their teams accordingly.
