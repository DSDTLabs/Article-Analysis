VADODARA: It seems a pre-scripted drama is unfolding at M   campus. 

 After dragging its feet on announcement of student union polls which have already got delayed this year,   on Wednesday did not issue the notification for the MSU Students Union (MSUSU) polls citing “legal complications”. 
 
 The university is under fire for dilay-dallying the students union polls to salvage the image of right-wing supported student outfit   that is likely to taste defeat in a year when the assembly polls are crucial to the ruling  . 
 
 On Wednesday, instead of issuing the notification for MSUSU polls, the university officials said that they are taking legal opinion on the matter since they have received a legal notice stating that holding the MSUSU polls will be contempt of court. 
 
 Ironically, the university had received this legal notice on September 16. But it was only on Wednesday that the officials said that they have sought legal opinion. 
 
 “After receiving the legal notice, we had sought legal opinion from local advocate which had made negative remarks. We have now sought legal opinion from advocate general of  . We are waiting for his legal opinion. It will be only after we get the legal opinion that we can take the decision on whether we should issue notification for holding MSUSU polls,” said MSU registrar Neerja Jaiswal. 
 
 It is worth mentioning here that it was only after student outfits except the ABVP launched a major stir at the campus that the university’s syndicate body declared that the union polls will be held on October 5. 
 
 Later, it was only after student outfits staged another protest that the university appointed returning officer for the polls. 
 
 Sources in BJP suggest that the top brass in the state government is not keen on holding the students union polls at MSU as ABVP’s defeat in the student elections will cause a major embarrassment to the ruling party in the state which goes to polls in next three months.
