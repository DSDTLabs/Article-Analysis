CHENNAI: The proposed multi-level parking lot on   in T   will be ready to open in 18 months, municipal administration minister S P   said on Friday.

 The senior   minister flagged off construction of the facility with a building schedule and a symbolic foundation stone-laying ceremony at the project site. 
 
 The parking lot is one of the first proposals under the   project to reach execution phase. Bids for the facility, which will come up on a land measuring 1,488sqm, were received last September. However, the work order was issued last month. “The project will be completed in around one-and-a-half year’s time,” Velumani said.
 
 The Rs 36.54-crore structure, once complete, the will have two underground floors and six floors above ground level.
 
 “The basement has space to park around 550 two-wheelers. In the ground and six other floors, at least 250 cars can be parked,” Velumani added.
 
 The corporation has approved of a functional design for the parking lot; features in the facility will be automated. Robotic trolleys will transport cars to and from a parking slot within the lot, officials . “The maximum time to retrieve a car from the parked slot would be between 60 and 90 seconds,” a corporation official said. The facility is likely to have a built-in drop protection.
 
 The parking lot will be a standout feature of the corporation’s proposed pedestrian plaza project. Parking in the facility will not be cheap. The corporation plans to introduce dynamic parking fee system for the entire city. For T Nagar, and more specifically Theyagaraya Road, this means a premium fee will be charged for parking vehicles on main roads.
 
 In residential areas abutting the facility, a nominal parking fee will be levied though it is, as yet, unclear if the same policy will be implemented on vehicles belonging to local residents too.
