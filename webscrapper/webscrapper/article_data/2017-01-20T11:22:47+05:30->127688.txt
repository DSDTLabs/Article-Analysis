RANCHI:   Ashwini Jha on Thursday held a meeting at his office to   to monitor the rising activities of CPI (Maoist) and its   in Khunti, Simdega, Gumla and other districts of Ranchi. The districts were represented by their respective SPs, along with IG Operation, who chaired the meeting. 

 While several rebels have surrendered under the "Nayi Disha" programme launched by the state police, incidents of violence and disruption of developmental activities continue across the state. 
 
 On Wednesday night, four vehicles and a generator, which were being used for the restoration of Latraatu dam at Birda village of Khunti, were burnt down by PLFI operatives. This is the third such incident in Khunti this month. Previously, the construction of a road and an Indian Oil pipeline were disrupted by burning down the vehicles which were being used at the site. Several other incidents of burning vehicles, which were deployed at construction sites, have occurred in the districts of Simdega, Gumla and Ranchi in January. 
 
 Ashwini Jha said, "We have been instructed by IG Ashish Batra to gather all the information conduct operations through inter-district co-ordination and ensure all extremist activities come under control."
