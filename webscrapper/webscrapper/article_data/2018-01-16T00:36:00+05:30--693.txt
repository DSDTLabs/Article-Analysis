Among the 700 bull tamers who took part in the jallikattu at Palamedu, 22-year-old B Mani, a local youth, stole the show.

 Mani is a trained bull tamer. However, his physical features are far from suggesting so. Though not well-built, Mani certainly made an impact among the crowd by taming seven bulls. Many of the spectators soon became familiar with his jersey number 135.The courage with which he handled the bulls made him apart.
 
 Mani said he could do it with ease as he had been playing with bulls since his childhood. While many of the tamers gave away and went in search of fence to cling on when some renowned bulls were released, Mani never gave a thought about it. He is also an accomplished runner and had won several competitions at the local events, he said.
 
 Murugan, Villi, Sakthivel and Sivaraj were also adjudged as the best tamers for the next spots. The bull belonging to P Rajasekar of Jallikattu Peravai was adjudged as the best.
 
 It was raining prizes at the event. Though there were no big prizes like Royal Enfield Bullet last year, it included couple of bikes, gold and silver coins, electronic gadgets, street bureaus and utensils. There were also prizes like goats and calves.
