KOLKATA: When a UK-based homemaker lodged a complaint against two kids' abuse at Lake Market, the police had no clue they would come across several more such victims -all below 10 -who were frequently being assaulted and molested there.

 The youngsters often did not realize they were being harassed even as the accused forced them into illegal labour in exchange for food and paltry sums. Pujarini Banerjee, who came down from the UK to visit her parents in  , lodged a complaint against two men at the Tollygunge PS for allegedly molesting and two kids outside   a week ago. TOI on Friday accompanied two cops, who took   to Lake Market to locate the kids and their tormentors. They found one of the boys and picked up the names of three probable accused.The kid revealed “Alu, Patal and   hit the other boy last week“, but declined he was abused. “The three possibly work in the market,“ said an officer. The probe revealed that 17odd kids were being illegally used as cheap labour; though the kids' parents were aware of it, they never protested.
 
 “We joke around and hit them playfully at times. But we pay them and give food,“ said a fish seller, who employed two boys to scale fish. A chicken seller claimed they had the right to “discipline“ the kids.
 
 The cops found two other kids who also claimed they were tortured. “My son said he was thrashed at times but I didn't pay much heed,“ said a domestic help, Chhutki Das.
 
 Police plan to step up surveillance in the market to stop child labour and abuse.
 
 
 
 
 This is the perfect example of what citizen-police cooperation can achieve. Citizens need to be proactive like this woman, who has gone out of her way to help a child in distress.And cops need to respond with alacrity similar to that they have shown in this case.
