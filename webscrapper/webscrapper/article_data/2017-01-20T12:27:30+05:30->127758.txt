THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Centre has sought action from the state government on a petition against additional chief secretary (home and vigilance)   alleging that she had helped   Jacob Thomas out of the way in connection with his taking up private employment without government permission. 

 The   has forwarded the petition by Sathyan Naravoor, a Kannur native, along with a covering letter asking chief secretary SM Vijayanand to take appropriate action and inform the ministry.
 
 The petitioner has alleged that without any information about Thomas returning the Rs 8.74-lakh remuneration he got from TKM institute in Kollam, the additional chief secretary had concluded that there was no need to take any disciplinary action against Thomas.
 
 The petitioner said that Netto did not examine the details of remittance through bank, demand draft or bank transfer, the date on which the amount was paid back and also whether the institute has got the money back from Thomas.
 
 The petitioner also alleged that the additional chief secretary illegally helped Thomas in another case, when he had openly ridiculed the then chief minister. Though the instruction was to suspend the officer, Netto delayed action on the file, with a mala-fide intention of protecting Thomas, against all disciplinary procedures and rules.
 
 Similar allegations were raised in another petition against Netto submitted by Satheesh Vasanth, a Thiruvananthapuram native, in the vigilance court on Wednesday. The court has sought the views of the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau about the allegations and has asked the agency to file its views on January 27.
