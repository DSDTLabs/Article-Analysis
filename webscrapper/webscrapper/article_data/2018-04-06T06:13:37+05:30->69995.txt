GURUGRAM: The Punjab and Haryana high court has reprimanded the state government for not submitting its   on   in  , Palam Vihar. 

 A fee regulatory committee constituted by the government was supposed to submit a report in the matter on Wednesday, but it failed to do so. The court has now directed it to submit the report by April 18. 
 
 Meanwhile, DPSG authorities said of the 296 students whose fee dues hadn’t been cleared, 56 have paid the fee till now. Only these kids will be allowed to appear for their annual exams this week.
 
 After allegations of arbitrary fee hike by DPSG, the HC had in December 2017 ordered the government to form a committee to decide if the hike was justified and submit a report on February 28. “The committee was formed in December itself. But it has not submitted its report so far,” said Dev Kumar, president of DPSG Parents Association.
 
 On February 28, the deadline was extended to April 4, but the committee again failed to submit the report. Justice Jaswant Singh rapped the panel for the delay and ordered them to submit the report by April 18. DPSG principal Deepika Sharma said the school has nothing to do with the delay. “There is no question of the school influencing the committee not to submit their report.”
 
 “The school submitted its report to us very late, around March 26. I have to do a fair job and listen to everyone,” said Faridabad divisional commissioner G Anupama, who is heading the fee committee.
