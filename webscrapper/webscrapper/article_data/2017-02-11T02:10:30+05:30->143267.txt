NEW DELHI: Following in the footsteps of app-based taxi drivers, a section of the kaali-peeli taxi unions in the city have announced a strike on  . The strike will include regular as well as tourist taxis, said Sanjay Samrat of Delhi Taxi Tourist Transporters and Tour Operators’ Association.

 Meanwhile, Kanwaljeet Gill of Sarvodaya Drivers’ Association of Delhi, which had put together Friday’s strike, said app-based taxi services will remain suspended even on Monday.
 
 Autorickshaw unions, however, have stayed away from strike so far. Rajender Soni of Delhi Autorickshaw Sangh said, “We are not giving support to the strike as the Ola-Uber taxis have taken away our livelihoods. Because of them, many of our drivers are leading lives in penury.”
 
 Kishan Verma of Delhi Auto Taxi Transporters Congress seconded Soni saying that autorickshaws would be available on Monday. “We will ensure that autorickshaws are all present on Monday, especially at railway stations,” Soni said.
 
 Sources said that Delhi government is monitoring the situation. “The government rules are clear on fares and anyone plying in the city will have to follow them,” said an official.
 
 However, with app-based aggregating companies going to court over the attempts by the transport department to put a ban on illegal taxis, the matter has taken a backseat. Though the app-based taxi companies don’t have a permit to ply, no action has been taken as the matter is subjudice, added the official.
 
 The fare chart by Delhi government for radio taxis has been capped at Rs 23 per km, as opposed to the low fares charged by the taxi aggregating companies. Both Ola and Uber charge a base fare of Rs 40 for a certain category of vehicles with a rate of Rs 6 per km being charged thereafter.
