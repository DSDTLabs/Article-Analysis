NAGPUR: City theatre groups were back at Rashtrabhasha Parivar on Friday evening to stage and watch two plays ‘Ghusmat’ and ‘Asar’ which marked the revival of Friday theatre activity under the banner of ‘First Bell On Stage’.

 Directed by Chetan   who wrote the story too, ‘Ghusmat’, which means suffocation, spoke of politicians and their acts that cause immense inconveniences to common people. Using 11 actors on stage to essay various situations that bring out the vices in society and ultimately destroy it, Wagh who played the role of Guruji did a fine job with the story and direction. 
 
 The second presentation was a 10-minute skit written by   and directed by   and Shivangi Singh who also formed the cast. Titled ‘Asar’ the short act spoke of a moment that impacts life and changes it forever.
 
 Held after a long gap, ‘First Bell On Stage’ is a popular initiative among the amateur theatre groups of the city as it provides them with a platform to present their plays. 
 
 The practice so far has been to feature a debuting play under this banner. Some of the plays that debuted here like ‘Mughalon Ne Sultanat Baksh Di’, ‘Tai’ and ‘Ratan’ attained immense popularity and also won awards at various competitions. Rashtrabhasha Parivar also connects various theatre persons and aspiring ones through the acting, writing and direction workshops that are conducted here.
 
 Though lacking infrastructure like a proper stage, lights and sound system, the activity runs on the steam of strong sentiments. “For artistes what matters is a chance to express their creativity which this platform provides,” said newbie actor Gauri Dixit.
