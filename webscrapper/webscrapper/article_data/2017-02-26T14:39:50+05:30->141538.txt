What's cooking between   and  ? Not just dosa, we suppose! The teaser trailer for Jyothika's upcoming film 'Magalir Mattum' released a few days ago. Following that, 2D Entertainment, Suriya's production house, had come up with a ' ' on Twitter. When they came out with this unique campaign, Suriya was one of the first to take up the challenge and several other followed suit. 

 The latest to join the campaign is actor Jai. While the other stars had taken up the dosa challenge and made dosa for their mother or wife, Jai has made dosa for his close 'friend', actress Anjali. Though the duo have been rumoured to be dating for long time, both have denied any romantic relationship between them. 
 
 The interesting fact is that, once director   had challenged Jai to take up the challenge, he immediately replied asking for 10 minutes to go and buy the dosa batter. And within an hour, he posted pictures of him making the dosa and also posted a picture along with Anjali! 
 
 This incident has once again set the rumour mills spinning.
