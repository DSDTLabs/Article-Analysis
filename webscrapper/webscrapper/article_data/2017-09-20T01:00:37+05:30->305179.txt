CHHAPRA: Paying rich tributes to Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya on his birth centenary governor-cum-chancellor Keshari Nath Tripathi on Tuesday called him a great patriot and thinker who practised the philosophy of ‘Ekatma Manav Darshan’ throughout his life.   “Panditji reinvented our Vedic philosophy and presented it in a way which is applicable to the present as well as future generations,” said Tripathi, who was here to inaugurate a national seminar on ‘Kashmir Problem: Ek Vimarsh’, organized at the senate hall of JP University    Expressing his opinion on Kashmir, governor Tripathi said that religious fanaticism is the root of all problems. “Our constitution is our real guide and one should follow it to resolve all problems. If India would have accepted the demand for plebiscite in Kashmir, the integrity of the country would have been at stake and several other states would have come forward with a demand for separation on the basis of language and culture,” said the governor.    “Kashmir is an integral part of our country,” he said adding, “Terrorism will soon end there and the government is determined to do it.”    Prior to him, RSS pracharak Ram Dutt said, “Kashmir must be saved for the integrity of this country. Jammu & Kashmir is an integral part of India and no power on earth can snatch it from us.”    Coordinator of BJP education cell Sudhakar Singh and state BJP president Nityanand Rai also expressed their views on the subject.    JPU VC Harikesh Singh welcomed the guests, while pro-VC Prof AK Jha proposed the vote of thanks. The seminar was organized by the department of history, Rajendra College. However, the inaugural function was held at the university senate Hall.
