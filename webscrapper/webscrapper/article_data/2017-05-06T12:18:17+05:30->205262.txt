THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   across the state is likely to get   peak hours, till Sunday. 

 The state electricity board had been exercising selective restrictions in power supply from 6:30pm to 10pm since Thursday after there was a shortage of 400 MW power following issues in   power evacuation line and   in Thalcher  . KSEB has announced small scale power restrictions during peak hours to circumvent the unexpected dip in the power from outside the state.
