AHMEDABAD : After the   sought a report into the   lodged in April 2017 against Gitanjali Jems’ promoter  ,   have decided to go for a review of the case to bring it to a logical end. Gitanjali Gems is a sister concern of   companies which are allegedly involved in Rs 11,400 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam.

 The court has posted the matter for further hearing on March 14. The city crime branch has urged the victims of the chit fund case to come forward and lodge complaints.
 
 Choksi had moved the high court for quashing of the FIR on the ground that he had reached a compromise with complainant Mita Mankad who had alleged that Choksi and five others, through his Gitanjali Gems franchise, had cheated her by floating a chit fund scheme which never realized.
 
 Another accused in the case, Digvijaysinh Jadeja, who runs a franchise of Gitanjali Gems in the state, also filed an appeal seeking to make him a respondent in the case and direct the police to probe the matter.
 
 Police have started a review of the case as the scheme was not allegedly floated in other cities and states.
 
 “People had invested their hard-earned money in the scheme which promised that they would get good returns and that they could also convert their return into gold. Though Choksi, one of the accused in the case, was not arrested at the time the FIR was lodged, the investigation may turn towards Choksi who is on the run at present,” said a top police official.
 
 Police have urged the other victims to come forward and lodge complaints to help in the probe. “We are revisiting some of witness statements recorded by us at that time and we could probably contact them again for further statements,” said a senior police official.
