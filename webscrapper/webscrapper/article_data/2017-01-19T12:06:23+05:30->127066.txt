VADODARA: Top government officials may have to part with a portion of some land in the bungalows in the posh   as the   (VMC) is looking to widen the RC Dutt Road. 

 The civic body has   on one side of this road to widen it. The widening of this road has been under consideration for several years now but it had remained a non-starter due to some shops coming in the road line on one side and the posh bungalows on the other. VMC too had been reluctant in acquiring land from the bungalows for the purpose. In the recent past, the closest that the VMC came to acquiring the land was in 2011 when the matter was taken up with government officials. But the momentum fizzled out again and nothing was heard of the widening project. 
 
 The bungalows whose sprawling gardens will have to be trimmed include those of the district collector, district development officer, police commissioner, Vadodara range inspector general of police and the district judge. The circuit house, Officer’s Club, Bank of Baroda’s guest house and its other facilities as well as a couple private bungalows are also located on the stretch.
 
 VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao said that the civic body was in talks with the concerned officers for the land . He added that the notices had been issued for land when the plans were made. Five to six metres of land will be acquired from the bungalows and other properties to widen the road. VMC is eyeing to make the road 30 m wide.
