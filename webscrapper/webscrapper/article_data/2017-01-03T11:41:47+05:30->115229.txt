CHARMINAR: Hundreds of tourists may visit historical places in the Old City, including the iconic Charminar, which draws everyone's attention towards its art and beauty, but unfortunately the roads connecting to the places is a nightmare for motorists. 

 Residents complain that   and upgradation of dilapidated roads   in Old City areas. As the condition of roads continue to trouble people, authorities projected Puchmohalla as the new and alternate road connecting Charminar, Moghalpura and Shahalibanda. But that route has also become a big worry for people now. 
 
 It bad. Tourists often complain about the bad quality of roads and we try to explain in vain to authorities that good roads are important for tourism," said Shabaz Ahmed, a restaurant owner. 
 
 Mohd Qasim, resident of Shahgunj said that Muslimjungpul, Hussainialam and other roads leading to Charminar are also in bad condition. "Patchwork is not enough to keep the city smart. We want the government should take corrective steps towards bad roads problem,'' Qasim said. Due to the sorry state of roads, some traders protested on Monday, following which patch work has been promised on some routes, but it continues to irk motorists.
 
 Punch Mohalla, inside Laad Bazar and outer road have developed cracks and potholes, giving a hard time to motorists and locals. "Although crores of rupees are being spent on repair of roads across the twin cities, Old City condition remains the same.
