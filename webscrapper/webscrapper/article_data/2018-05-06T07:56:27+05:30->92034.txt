HYDERABAD: The recently-inaugurated underpass at Mindspace junction, built at a cost of ₹25.8 crore, has evoked mixed responses on social media from commuters in the IT hub.

 
 While a majority of commuters have welcomed the move and said it has reduced traffic congestion in the Biodiversity Park area, some of the commuters have complained that their travel time has only gone up further, post its inauguration.
 
 The underpass has been built as part of   government’s ambitious Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP). The objective of Strategic Road Development Plan was to ease traffic congestion between Cyber Towers and the Biodiversity Park.
 
 Lauding the prompt inauguration of the underpass at Mindspace junction, Mallik Reddy, a commuter wrote on Twitter: “Felt the difference while coming to office this morning. Must say, a trafficless happy morning.”
 
 Another regular commuter on this stretch, Gautam Aditya, stated: “We are grateful for the underpass that opened recently near Raheja Mindspace. Thank you for all the work done for easing traffic issues. May I suggest sign boards to guide the traffic? Without these the traffic jams are getting longer than usual.”
 
 But not all the commuters were as generous with their compliments. Some commuters, in fact claimed, that the congestion post the opening of the underpass has simply shifted to another location.
 
 According to Kumar Krishnamoorthy, only a day post its opening, a ‘huge traffic jam’ had formed between Gachibowli and   junction. “Guess Hyderabad is not getting any relief soon from the traffic woes,” a commuter   wrote on Twitter.
 
 To avoid such traffic snarls at other locations, a commuter B Srinivas requested the Cyberabad traffic police to modify routes.
 
 “Mindspace underpass is very cool but going from   to   has become more lengthy and time-consuming,” tweeted Sunil Vuppala.
