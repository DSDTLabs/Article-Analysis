LUCKNOW: The battle for the 10th seat from UP in   polls reached the Lucknow bench of Allahabad HC on Wednesday with BSP general secretary S C Mishra filing a petition for the release of two MLAs,   (BSP) and Hariom Yadav (SP), from jail so that they can vote on Friday. The election for the 10th seat is set for a photo finish between BJP candidate Anil Agarwal and BSP’s  , who is being backed by opposition parties. 

 
 The votes of the two MLAs are crucial in deciding Ambedkar’s fortunes. Appearing for the Yogi government, advocate general Raghvendra Singh opposed Mishra’s petition arguing that as per 62(5) provision of People’s Representative Act, anyone in police custody is not to be allowed to participate in voting. Mishra pleaded before the court that the two MLAs were not in police custody, but in judicial custody and in the past imprisoned MLAs had been allowed to cast their votes in UP and in other states. 
 
 Hearing will take place on Thursday for a final judgment. While Ansari is in jail for the past 13 years for his alleged role in Mau riots and the murder of BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai, Yadav surrendered before a court after a warrant was issued against him for his involvement in panchayat poll violence three years ago. Mishra had approached EC in Delhi on Tuesday for the release of the two MLAs, but he moved HC on Wednesday when he got no relief. 
 
 Of the total 10 seats, BJP can comfortably win eight seats and SP one. BJP is hoping to win the 10th seat with its 26 spare votes . It will need support of just 11 more MLAs to win the 10th seat. BSP, which has 19 MLAs, is banking on SP’s 10 spare votes, Congress’s seven MLAs and RLD’s lone legislator to reach the victory mark of 37 votes. Though SP MLA  , son of  , has switched over to BJP, the Samajwadis are confident of winning over a couple of independents and legislators from smaller parties.
