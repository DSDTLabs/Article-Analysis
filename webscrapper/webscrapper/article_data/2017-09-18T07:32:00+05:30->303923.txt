New Delhi: Days after senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh got called out for posting derogatory words against PM Narendra Modi, another leader Manish Tewari tweeted on similar lines, triggering a war of words on social media.

 Trolled by a Modi supporter who said even Mahatma Gandhi could not teach nationalism to the PM, Tewari replied with an unsavoury tweet on the lines of what Digvijay had retweeted.
 
 The tweet, using a crude Hindi word, attracted wide attention and criticism. Earlier this month, Digvijay used the same phrase which he had clarified was not his but he had only retweeted someone else’s post.
 
 Following the storm, Tewari said he had just responded to a troll on nationalism and was ready to apologise but asked Modi if he would ‘unfollow’ persons who were regularly hurling abuse on women.
 
 The Congress maintained silence and left it to Tewari to explain. However, there is a sense in the party that leaders should resist the temptation of using objectionable words on social media despite provocations from the supporters of BJP.
 
 BJP media coordinator Anil Baluni said it was sad that a former Union minister had used abusive language against the country’s prime minister.
