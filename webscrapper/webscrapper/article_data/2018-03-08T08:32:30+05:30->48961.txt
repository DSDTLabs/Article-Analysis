BENGALURU: Far from home and trying to make themselves acceptable, aspirants for an assembly ticket are open to exploring new ground to improve their electoral prospects.

  
 JD(S) leader  ,  , V S Ugrappa, and  ,  , Upendra and  , chief minister Siddaramaiah’s former secretary, are among prominent names likely to try new options. The considerable presence of their community voters and their family roots are driving them to test their luck.
 
 The JD(S) is considering fielding Sindhia from Basavakalyana in Bidar, 650 km from his hometown Bengaluru. The JD(S) sitting MLA Mallikarjun Khuba has deserted the party, necessitating a change. By fielding Sindhia, the party plans to take advantage of the concentration of Maratha votes in the segment.
 
 The party feels Sindhia’s rapport in the constituency — he was Bidar district in-charge minister in the 90s — will stand him in good stead. “There is a proposal that I should contest from Basavakalyana,” he said.
 
 Congress MLC, M D Lakshminarayana from Tumakuru is contesting from Belagavi South constituency. He belongs to the weaver community and Belagavi South has 40,000 voters from the community. “It is the party decision to field me from Belagavi South as a majority of voters belong to Ahinda groups,” said Lakshminarayana, who moved his family to Belagavi four months ago.
 
 Congress MLC, Ugrappa from Tumakuru, has set his eyes on Molakalmuru segment in Chitradurga, while   MLC Raghu Acharya from Mysuru is trying for a ticket from Chitradurga. Actor Bhavana is seeking a ticket from the same seat.
 
 JD(S) has nominated Javeed as its candidate from Ramdurg in Belagavi. A realtor who operates from Bengaluru and Hubballi, Javeed has been nurturing the constituency for four years.
