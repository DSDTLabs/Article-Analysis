KERI:   in Caranzol-Sonal, a natural spot inside the Mhadei river, has become a death trap with over 15 youth drowning at the spot while swimming there in summer.

 On Saturday morning, a college student, Gauresh Barve from Vitthalapur-Karapur, drowned in the Mhadei river near Mhovacho Guno.
 
 Barve, 20, a student of Government College, Sakhali, along with his friends Pravin Gadgil and Mayuresh Bhat visited Mhovacho Guno for swimming. He was carried by water currents into deep river and began to drown. Gadgil, at this juncture, jumped into the river and made an attempt to save him, but he began to drown too. Bhat managed to rescue Gadgil. Local villagers, along with a lifeguard, managed to locate Barve in an unconscious state. He was declared ‘brought dead’ by hospital authorities in  .
 
 On May 14, Sanket Shankar Sawant, 27, of Manaswada-Kundaim drowned at Mhovacho Guno after he visited the spot along with three of his friends.
 
 Police inspector, Valpoi, Deepak Pednekar has taken serious note of the frequent drowning incidents in the river at Mhovacho Guno. He has already deployed two police constables at Sonal who inform people visiting the spot about the danger zone in the river. Many youth visit the place with alcohol bottles and after drinking, they break the bottles at the spot and jump into the river under the influence of liquor.
 
 As the Mhadei river is perennial and water is crystal clear, many youth from various parts of Goa are attracted to the spot. But, due to sheer negligence and sometimes under the influence of alcohol, many have lost their lives.
