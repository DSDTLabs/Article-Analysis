KOLHAPUR: The   has predicted   this year, but the pressure is building on Koyna dam in   due to the reducing water levels. The dam, which generates 1,960 MW electricity, has stopped generation of 1,000 MW in the fourth stage.

 The dam has a capacity of 105.25 TMC and the usable water storage is 100.125 TMC.
 
 Dnyaneshwar Bagade, executive engineer of Koyna dam, said, “ As per the Krishna water dispute tribunal, it is essential to divert 67.50 TMC water towards the west for power generation from June 1to May 31.
 
 Till April-end, Mahagenco ( ) diverted 67.25 TMC water and is planning to utilise the remaining 0.25 TMC in May. “Bagade said that accordingly the decision was taken taken by Mahagenco to “stop generation of power in the fourth stage, which is 1,000 MW“.

 “Till date, 26.87 TMC water has been used the water in the dam is only 22.02 TMC now,“ he said “Considering the need for water in May and the loss of water due to evaporation and power generation, 5.87 TMC will be utilised for these purposes. By the end of this month, only 10.925 TMC will remain,“ said Bagade.
