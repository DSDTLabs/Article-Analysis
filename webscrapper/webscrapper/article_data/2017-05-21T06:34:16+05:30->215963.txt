LUCKNOW:   chief   on Saturday joined the opposition in attacking the BJP over rising incidents of crime in the state.   said the ‘Raj Dharm’ of criminal elements had taken over the rule of law in UP.

 She said not only Dalits but also traders, the base vote bank of BJP, were being targeted by criminals. “The bandhs organised by traders in protest of crime incidents have exposed the hollow claims of the BJP government in the state,’’ she said.
 
 Mayawati also took a pot shot at UP chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi’s statement that ‘criminals would be treated in their own language’. She said the Yogi government should understand that criminals only understand the language of law.
 
 The former UP chief minister also accused the BJP of not being able to stop its own brigade from unleashing terror by attacking people of lower caste and minorities.
