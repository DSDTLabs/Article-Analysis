TRICHY: Tamil Maanila   president GK Vasan has alleged that both the BJP-led central government and Congress government in   were conspiring against Tamil Nadu in the   water dispute, here on Friday.

 “They are indulging in backdoor alliance to betray Tamil Nadu and its farmers. Compared to other four south Indian states, Tamil Nadu farmers are on the verge of facing drought. We strongly condemn this conspiracy,” Vasan told reporters during the hunger-strike observed by his party and farmers associations at Thennur Uzhavar Santhai Grounds on Friday.
 
 Vasan went ahead with his scathing attack and accused both the BJP and Congress for failing to respect the law. “Both parties are challenging the law by not forming the CMB as per Supreme Court order. If farmers face problems, the elected government should be at the forefront to give solutions. Tamil Nadu government is functioning without applying any pressure. Cauvery water is our right and giving it to us legally is the central government’s duty,” he said. Vasan also stressed on the need to ensure that the law was equal to Tamil Nadu and others by forming the CMB.
 
 On the appointment of MK Surappa from Karnataka as the vice-chancellor of Anna University, Vasan said it was an untimely appointment. “It is not the right time for the announcement. It is adding insult to the injury. They should have considered several other higher officials, who are also in the race,” he said.
