Vadodara: After playing garba till late in the night on the last day of Navratri, Barodians were up on the feet to celebrate Dussehra on Saturday. Thousands of citizens turned up at Polo Ground to witness Ram Leela and Ravan Dahan.

 However, the excitement of several people after watching Ravan Dahan was turned down when they realized that their pockets had been picked or their mobile phones were stolen. While trying to leave the venue from a single gate near Baroda High School, Bagikhana, at least 30 citizens realized that they had either lost their wallets or mobile phones. The victims, after desperately searching for their lost items, went to Navapura police station to register their complaints.
