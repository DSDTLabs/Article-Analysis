Kolkata: Trolley trouble resurfaced at Kolkata   on Thursday evening, sparking angry protests by passengers who had to tow their luggage after being unable to locate any carts near the baggage retrieval belts.

 Around 180-odd passengers who arrived by IndiGo flight 6E 76 from Bangkok were surprised when they reached the baggage carousal after immigration check. There were hardly any trolleys in sight. Initially, they thought the trolleys would eventually be made available but when there was no sign of the carts although all baggage had arrived, shock gave way to anger. IndiGo ground staff came in for flak as the passenger directed their ire towards them. 
 
 “The airport operator provides the trolleys, not the airlines. But how can one explain that to irate passengers ? It was really pathetic. We informed the airport manager who did arrange for 200 trolleys. But by then, the damage was done,” an airline ground staff said.
 
 Airport director Atul Dikshit admitted a problem had occured on Thursday evening and said the airport was working to ensure it did not recur. But an official of the company that has the contract to retrieve trolleys said the situation would persist till AAI provided more trolleys.
