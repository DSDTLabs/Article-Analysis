PANCHKULA: Sector 20, which falls in the ward of mayor  , has long-standing issues of stray-dog menace and encroachment upon the market corridors.

 Encroachment has led to traffic chaos in the ward. “I fail to understand what prevents the municipal corporation from reclaiming its land,” a resident said. The mayor said: “The land grabbers kept coming back after special campaigns to rid the market of encroachment. After the survey of the street vendors got over in the city, I kept requesting the authorities concerned to evict illegal vendors but they allowed the problem to aggravate.”
 
 The scare of   is another unresolved issue. Sector-20   president Colonel   said: “The MC has a standard reply that it is sterilizing the street dogs, which is absurd. Does the dog stop biting after sterilization?”
 
  Expressing her helplessness in this situation, the mayor said the irony was that the law didn’t permit a dog pound. Responding to queries of the residents who could not step into streets for the fear of dogs, the mayor said: “In two years, we will control the population of stray dogs, since their sterilization is in full swing in the area.” The residents say they don’t see it.
