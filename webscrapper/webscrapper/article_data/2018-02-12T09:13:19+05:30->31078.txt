VADODARA: Large number of parents on Sunday took part in a signature campaign organized by the Vadodara District Parents Association to build pressure on the state government on the fee hike issue. 

 Over 1,000 parents besides political, social and religious leaders took part in the campaign at Gandhi Nagargruh. Parents are demanding that private schools should collect only fees fixed as upper limits by the Gujarat Self-Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017. 
 
 “We will submit memorandum with signatures to education minister and secretary of education department enlisting all the 12 points on February 14 as feedback from parent organizations,” said association’s spokesperson  . 
 
 The government has formed a three-member committee to study problems faced by parents. The last day to submit representations before the committee is February 15. Based on the committee’s recommendations, the government will submit its view to the Supreme Court which has directed the state government to fix the fee caps for private schools after hearing all the stakeholders. 
 
 “We are demanding that there is nothing that warrants hike in school fees. Through the Act, the annual fees has already been capped at Rs 15,000, Rs 25,000 and Rs 27,000 for primary, middle and high school levels which should continue as the capped fees,” he said. 
 
 The association members said that parents from all major private schools including Navrachana, Nalanda, D R Amin Memorial, Delhi Public School, Gujarat Public School, Bright, Baroda High School, Shannen, Shaishav, Prince Ashok Raje Gaekwad,   among others participated in the campaign. 
 
 Representatives BJP, Congress, Aam Admi Party and SUCI apart from former mayor Ratilal Desai also remained present, they said.
