Madurai: Parents of special children who came to the newly-inaugurated park in Alagarkoil road in Madurai on Saturday, were overwhelmed that their children too could play in parks like normal children, but want the authorities to ensure that their children get priority there.

 A mother of a 11-year-old boy, who took her child for a walk around the park said that his happiness was evident. “The play equipment has been specially designed and I have decided to bring him here whenever it is possible, but it would be better if the special children are given priority here,” she said, after noticing that some school children too had entered it and were occupying the chairs.
 
 The parents are not averse to normal children coming and playing in their park, but say that it would be better if they are accompanied by their parents as it would help them mingle with their children and also get sensitised. “We would be more than happy if the normal children came forward to play with our children, because in the past we have faced problems in getting them to accept them,” said Selvi, a parent.
 
 Meanwhile, parents say that the park has come up after a long struggle, and they had to collect lot of donations from philanthropists to make up for their contribution. “The money was collected with great difficultly, so we just want to maintain the play equipment and steps should be taken to avoid them being broken or misused by elders and also children,” they said.
