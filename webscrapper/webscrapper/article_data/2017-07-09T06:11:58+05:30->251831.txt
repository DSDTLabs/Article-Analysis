HYDERABAD:   in   and Qatar, M C Luther, Protector-General of Emigrants, Government of India, as well as NRI affairs minister   have come forward to take up the case of city woman, Manjula, who is allegedly being tortured by her kafil in Saudi.

 On Saturday morning, an official of the Indian Embassy in Riyadh called up   Ravi after reading about her plight in TOI. Manjula's passport details were provided to the Indian Embassy in Riyadh and PGE by TOI following a request. Ravi gave the embassy official the telephone number from which his wife had called to tell him about her misery in Saudi Arabia.
 
 Manjula does not have a phone, but had made a desperate call to be rescued using another housemaid's phone. TOI had reported on July 8 that Manjula was being made to kneel in the sun and also being burnt with a hot iron rod, as she had told her husband Ravi. Manjula was smuggled into Saudi Arabia via Dubai in June last year.
 
 The call from the embassy gave huge relief to Ravi. “I have been asked by the embassy officials to tell my wife when she calls again to escape from the house where she is being held and reach the embassy ,“ Ravi told STOI. Ravi is not sure if his wife would be able to do that.
 
 “She would have done it long back if she could pull it off. The problem is that she is being held in the house and not allowed to go out,“ Ravi said. NRI affairs minister KTR also said he was working on the issue of Manjula's plight.
