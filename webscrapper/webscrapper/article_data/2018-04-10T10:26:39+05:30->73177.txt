BHOPAL: With the city of lakes staring at acute   this  , the civic body is relying on its age-old method of deploying additional water tankers to meet the demand of all the 85 wards.

 
 Sources said that given the situation in the election year, Bhopal Municipal Corporation ( ) has proposed to hire around 115 water tankers to meet the anticipated demand of water supply in all parts of Bhopal.
 
 
 BMC operates water supply tankers that move day and night to cater to water needs of the city. “More water tankers are being roped into the BMC fold. Demand for drinking water is being met by piped water supply. But there are some areas that require additional water from time to time,” said BMC city engineer, A K Pawar.
 
 
 By Monday evening, the civic body has already deployed 69 water tankers across Bhopal. Many of these tankers hold a capacity of 5,000 litre. Some of the newly purchased tankers can hold up to 15,000 litre.
 
 
 Water level of many bore-wells in BHEL and surrounding areas are showing signs of going dry. According to 10-year analysis of underground water, onethird of the wells in Bhopal have shown a decline. The fluctuation warns of more 30% of the drinking water sources are declining in the state capital. The 10-year data analysis was a mean of pre-monsoon 2007 to 2017.
 
 
 Kolar and Alkapuri that are part of some 16 wards, are considered to be areas where water shortage would have significant impact. Residents in these wards get less than one-hour of water supply per day. “We have paid the builder for water supply, but it is still erratic. Eventually, we have to rely on private   network,” said Sudhir Baldev, a resident of Kolar area.
 
 
 In many of the colonies, there is a demand in excess of 10 tankers per day. At Rs 500 per tanker, the residents welfare associations cannot afford to foot the bill and are relying on the civic body’s ‘free water supply’.
