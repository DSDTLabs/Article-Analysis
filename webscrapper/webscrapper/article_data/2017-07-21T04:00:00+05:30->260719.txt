Ahmedabad: How many lakes in the city have received rainwater this year? The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has called a meeting on Friday to enquire why some of the big lakes are yet to receive enough water. Vastrapur, Vatva, Naroda, Motera and other lakes that were developed so that rainwater collects in them, are nearly empty. On Thursday, the city received 59.29 mm average rainfall.

 Standing committee chairman Praveen Patel told journalists on Thursday that owing to new constructions around the lakes, many of the natural water courses to these lakes were blocked. “We are look at diverting nearby stormwater and drainwater to the lakes, But the issue of pollution comes up. We will soon find a solution to this problem,” Patel said.
 
 
 Rain-related woes did not end for Amdavadis on Thursday. A total of 580 rain-related complaints were lodged out of which a majority were related to drainage. People of west zone registered the highest number of complaints - 153 - while the new west zone registered 115 complaints. “There were 5 complaints about roadside trees having either tilted or got uprooted,” a senior AMC official said.
