AHMEDABAD: An   hearing the   asked the defence lawyer to show evidence against ex-IPS officer  , who the accused have sought to be implicated in the case and put on trial on charges of destruction of evidence in form of CDs containing call details.

 Designated judge   told advocate  , who has requested the court to arraign Sharma in the case as an accused, that he has to point out specific evidence for destruction of evidence against Sharma, and mere suggestion that evidence was destroyed is not enough.
 
 After this instruction to the defence counsel, the court has posted further proceeding on April 9.
 
 Accused persons have been seeking implication of Sharma and former investigator P L Mall in this case.
 
 In his reply filed last week, Sharma opposed the demand and asserted that he cannot be prosecuted because it was he who had revealed the information about existence of CDs and call details before an inquiry commission. Hence, he enjoys immunity from prosecution in this regard. The investigators did not bother about this evidence and had almost forgotten that such CDs ever existed.
 
 Sharma also maintained that though original CDs obtained from mobile phone service providers AT&T and Cellforce are not available, the data has not been tampered. Even the   has authenticated the data, when the special investigation team (SIT) sent it for verification. At the most, the CDs can be said to have been misplaced, and not destroyed as alleged, he said.
