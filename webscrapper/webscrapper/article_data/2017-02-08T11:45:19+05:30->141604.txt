 A total of 3,70,578 rural voters in the district vote in the 1,865 polling booths of the state in the   which are scheduled to begin on February 13. 
 
 "We have decided to make all booths disabled-friendly to ensure physically challenged people can exercise franchise without any difficulties," said district collector, Sudhansu Mohan Samal. While most of the booths will be set up in schools, 73 temporary booths will be set up in public places. "The temporary booths will be set up by in makeshift tents. As these temporary booths will be on the ground level, differently-abled persons will not be inconvenienced to a large extent," said the collector.

 In the last panchayat elections in 2012, wheelchair-bound people had found it difficult to climb up some schools as no ramps had been available then. While some had been assisted by family members, others had taken help from police personnel who were deployed near the polling stations. 
 
 Political parties had urged district administration to ensure disabled-friendly polling stations in the district.
