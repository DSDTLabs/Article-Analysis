Lucknow: As another financial year comes to an end, most government departments have released funds for 2016 to carry out construction and repair work in city. But while contractors are on a spree of digging roads to lay cables and sewer lines, most of them have left them open for over a month now. Locals complain the dug up roads make it highly risky to drive through as vehicles often bump or skid near the construction site. 

 Electricity department started laying cables along   almost a month ago and has left the road dug open. After many reminders, loose earth was filled in it. This area houses offices and commercial complexes and since there is no provision of underground parking here, people park cars on roadsides.
 
 A private sector employee   said, "We had taken permission from LMC to park cars on roadsides. But since the road has been cut open, it has become difficult to park cars and we are forced to leave our vehicles on roads and that creates traffic jams." 
 
 Similarly,   dug up roadsides in Vikasnagar for making cycle tracks in December 2015. Till date, the roads are lying dug up or partially filled with earth. Resident   said, "Our cars bump into construction material everyday. It becomes more dangerous during night when there is poor visibility in the absence of street lights."
 
 From   crossing to   chauraha, LMC has dug up roads to lay drainage pipes. The road has not been restored even after pipes have been laid. At some places, even pipes are not laid and the road is cut open. 
 
 A shopkeeper of the area, Anupam, said, "Only one lane has been left for vehicles to move on both sides. This creates long jams." 
 
 LMC said restoration is taking time because of bad weather but assured to repair roads by February first week.
