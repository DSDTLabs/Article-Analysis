BHUBANESWAR: Liquor,   and safety of women are some of the   being raised by women candidates contesting the ensuing   in most parts of the state. 

 "Many women from my village go to Bhubaneswar to earn their livelihood and return late. Their safety is a major concern. I want them to come forward against any kind of injustice being meted out to women they see around them. We all have to be strong enough to stand for ourselves," Manorama Bhoi, 35, who is contesting for the post of sarpanch in Balianta village and is busy going door-to-door campaigning. 
 
 Similarly, Ashamani Sahu, an aspiring candidate for panchayat samiti member in Kakarudrapur village said, "A brutal incident of a Class VIII student being raped by the driver of her school van raised the concern of safety of girls and women. I want all women to stand by others and create awareness about the safety measures they should take," said Sahu, who was ward member in the village. 
 
 She said, a few months ago women of her village had taken a strong stand against a liquor shop on the outskirts of their village and had it shut. "  is another main problem in the village, which we want to stop at any cost. It has forced many families to live in penury," she said. 
 
 The aspiring candidates are also focusing on proper management of anganwadi centres, midday meals in schools and Rogi Kalyan Samitis in their villages. "My village was awarded for not having a single child with malnutrition. Women representatives are more concerned about the health and food of their children while their male counterparts focus more on development works," said Archana Sahu, a former ward member of Balianta village.
