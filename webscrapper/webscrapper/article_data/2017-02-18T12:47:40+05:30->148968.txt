NOIDA: D K Sood, regional executive director NTPC Dadri, Badarpur and Faridabad (DBF) while highlighting DBF region's power stations' performance on Friday at   in sector 24, also threw light on power generation, ash utilisation and initiatives taken for environment protection and CSR activities.

 Focussing on environment friendly (solar, wind) energy with emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR) Sood, maintained that while Dadri coal station generated 7805.62 MU (amount of energy used) of electricity during financial year (FY) 2016-17 (upto Jan 31, 2017), the Dadri Gas Power Station (DGPS) generated 2035.52 MU of electricity during FY 2016-17 (upto Jan 31, 2017) and the 5 MW Solar Plant generated 5.507 MU green power during year 2016-17 (upto Jan 31, 2017). "DBF stations are expected to achieve all the internal operational MoU targets," said Sood.
 
 On environment friendly initiatives Sood maintained that all DBF stations are meeting the prevailing environmental norms with upgradation in necessary technological/operational interventions. "For example the Badarpur plant SPM is already below 50 mg/Nm3," said Sood.
 
 Many new environment friendly initiatives like zero liquidation (which means all water used in the plant is recycled within the plant), bio-gasifier plant revival, and solar thermal plant (HP heaters) which are in different stages of implementation.
 
 Further, the very pollutant Agra canal which serves the Badarpur power station has been converted into portable water by installing a RO plant by NTPC at the cost of 20 crores said Sood.
 
 Also, leaves and ash waste around   has been recycled to manure and used for road building (by NHAI) respectively etc. "The cumulative ash utilization up to Jan 2017 at Dadri included 197% and Badarpur was 157%," said Sood.
 
 In solar energy, Sood maintained that with total solar capacity at 360 Mw, DBF aims to increase that to 1000 Mw by March 2017. "Solar power is greatly compensating thermal energy because of cost rationalisation. But our major concern is ensuring solar's compatibility with thermal power right now," said Sood who added that out of total Delhi-NCR's solar capacity, 250 Mw is for Badla station followed by 5 Mw each for Faridabad and Dadri.
 
 DBF stations' CSR activity include provision of RO water at nearby villages and schools at Dadri. Skill upgradation training like vocational courses on cutting, tailoring, beautician, mobile repairing etc. to village youth/women at all DBF stations.
 
 Another 2000 LPH RO plant is under construction at   in Faridabad to provide drinking water to the villagers. "The total cost of RO plant is Rs. 17.32 lakhs. We've also completed work on 20 KW rooftop solar plant at Shirdi Sai Temple School in Faridabad at the cost of Rs 12 Lakh. Also, a financial assistance of Rs 3 Lakh is extended to the said school," said Sood who added that the Badarpur power station has been commissioned RO and STP in DM plant in 2016-17.
 
  Other CSR activities include 295 cataract eye operations by NTPC hospital in association with Jagriti Samaj in 2016 to Swachch Bharat drives.
 
  Meanwhile some accolades include, Dadri coal station selected as one of the top plant for 2016 among coal plants in the world by International Power Magazine.
 
  Further, according to Sood, Dadri coal is number one among all   in cumulative DC (dust call) up to Jan 2017 â€“ 101.72% with least forced outage up to 0.47 % and Dadri Gas is number one among all NTPC gas stations in PEM ranking up to Dec-16 with score of 71.00.
