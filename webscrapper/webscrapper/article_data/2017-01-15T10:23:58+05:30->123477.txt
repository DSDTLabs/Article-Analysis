AURANGABAD: Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment   on Saturday ruled out any possibility of a   between   and   for the   (BMC) polls. 

 “I don’t think that the parties will be able to resolve the seat-sharing issue before the elections. The BJP has gained considerable strength in the state capital, while the Shiv Sena has been trying to consolidate its hold. Both the parties are seeking a bigger share in the seat-sharing arrangement,” he said, while speaking to the media on the sidelines of the university Naamvistar programme on Saturday. 
 
 He, however, clarified that his party, Republican Party of India (A), would go with the BJP in all polls, including the BMC election. “Even if the Sena and the BJP are not coming together, I am sure they will join hands after the elections. We will try to bring the old allies together to the keep the Congress away from power,” he said. 
 
 Athawale said his party would contest at least 25 seats in the BMC polls with the BJP. He expressed confidence of the Shiv Sena and the BJP again coming to power in Mumbai. “The party with the majority seats would get the mayor’s post. We will demand the post of the deputy mayor,” he said. 
 
 Though he admitted that his party does not have mass support to win more seats in the elections, he said it has the power to play influencing role. “We have the balancing power which no party can afford to the lose,” he said. 
 
 Commenting on the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Athawale said they would support the BJP to form government. In reply to a query on demonetisation, he said the objective of the move was to flush out black money and raise funds for welfare activities for country’s poor. 
 
 “We will soon see good results of the move. We cannot deny that people are facing a lot of hardship due to cash crunch, but it is a temporary phase,” he said.
