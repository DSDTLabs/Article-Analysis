MUMBAI: Over a week after   C Vidyasagar Rao’s directive to take action against those responsible for the non-availability of his speech in  , the legislature secretariat is yet to fix responsibility for the goof-up. Instead, a   is on between the legislature secretariat and the general administration department (GAD).

 The opposition boycotted the Governor’s   to the legislature on February 26 as the Marathi translation was not available. Even chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had said stern action would be taken against errant officials by evening.
 
 The problem was that the translator was taken to the wrong place.
 
 The legislature secretariat now says it was the responsibility of the GAD to guide the translator to the right place, but the GAD says it is the rule of the legislature secretariat that prevails on the premises of the council hall and so it is responsible.
