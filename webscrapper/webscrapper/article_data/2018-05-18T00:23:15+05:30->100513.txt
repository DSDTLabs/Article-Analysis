Trichy: A group of farmers affiliated to the Tamizhaga Eri Mattrum Attru Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam staged a demonstration demanding the desilting of all water bodies and waterways before the commencement of monsoon, and to extend crop insurance to cereals also. During the demonstration, the protesters tied a noose around their necks to highlight their plight. They also raised slogans demanding the constitution of the Cauvery Management Board as per the order of the Supreme Court. They stressed that the entire decision making power regarding Cauvery water issue should be entrusted with the management board. The farmers also wanted the government to construct a barrage across the Kollidam river at Ponnar head in Ariyalur district and a dam across the river which crosses near Chinna Mutlu in Perambalur district. Pointing out that the Veeranam lake in Cuddalore district is in a pathetic state as silt on the bed gets accumulated every year and does not help in conserving rainwater to be used for both irrigation and drinking purposes, they urged that the waterbody should be desilted immediately. In another demand, the farmers urged the state government to commence the Cauvery - Vaigai - Gundar riverlinking process soon. The long-pending demand of constructing barrage between Kumaramangalam - Athanur should also be commenced.
