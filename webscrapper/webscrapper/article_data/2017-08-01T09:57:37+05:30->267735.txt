CHENNAI: A man posing as a hearing and speech impaired person escaped with two expensive mobile phones from a woman doctor’s clinic at   on Sunday afternoon.

 Police said   Raghunath, 31, was at her skin clinic on East Spur Tank Road when the man walked in around 1 pm. He appeared to be in his early 30s and was armed with a sheet.
 
 He showed the sheet, which explained his hearing and speech disabilities and his inability to get employment, to Mohanapriya’s staff and sough financial help. They, however, were not convinced and asked him to go away. “Believing the man had gone away, one employee went into a store room,” said an investigating officer. But, the man walked up to the rection desk and handed over the paper to the woman manning it. She initially thought he was a patient and allowed him inside, but asked him to go after reading the sheet. 
 
 A short while later, the doctor found her iPhone and a   device missing and alerted her staff.   and others launched a search before realising that the man had taken them away, police said.
 
 A team from the jurisdictional police station soon arrived and obtained closed circuit television ( ) camera footage from the hospital.
 
 A man answering the description of the suspect in Sunday’s incident is believed to have used a similar modus operandi and cheated a few people in the area in the past,” said an investigating officer.
 
 The Egmore police registered a case and are investigating.
