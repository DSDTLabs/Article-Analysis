Nagpur: In a setback to the district administration, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Monday quashed and set aside the collector’s orders to cancel licence of   Deluxe Bar and Restaurant.

 District collector Sachin Kurve cancelled the licence after he found that La Horee owner Sameer Sharma was running the bar even though the excise licence holder was someone else, thus violating Section 49 of the Bombay Prohibition Act, 1953.
 
 A single-judge bench comprising justice Zaka Haq observed that the collector’s move was against principles of natural justice and violation of fundamental rights of the petitioner. The bench pointed out that alternative remedy was available for the respondents.
 
 Earlier, senior counsel Surendra Kumar Mishra informed the court that grounds on which show-cause notice was issued to the petitioner and cancellation of licence were different.
 
 A quarrel between La Horee owner and some patrons broke out, followed by both parties firing in the air on November 13. This and many other similar incidents raised concerns about safety and security of residents in Dharampeth area.
 
 The issue also found mention in the assembly and council by opposition parties, which targeted chief minister Devendra Fadnavis calling Nagpur crime capital of the state.
