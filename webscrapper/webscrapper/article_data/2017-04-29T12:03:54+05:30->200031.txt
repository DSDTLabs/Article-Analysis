  : Jewellers from the city, who were hoping to make it big on the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya on Friday, said the souring prices of gold have affected the trade to a large extent. They said that the response from the buyers was not very encouraging despite offering attractive schemes and discounts. 

 The jewellers were expecting a total business of Rs 10-12 crore on the auspicious occasion of Akhaya Tritiya when buying gold is considered auspicious. 
 
 Most of the jewellery shops in the city have witnessed a considerable footfall, but its proportionate reflection in sales was not visible. "Most people bought small items instead of heavy jewellery," said one of the   jewellers, who preferred anonymity. 
 
 "Since  , excitement among the buyers was missing and thus we were expecting heavy buying on the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya. Most of us were expecting to see a stupendous hike in sales but that did not happen. It is likely that the sudden hike in gold prices-Rs 30,500 per 10 gram mark- has pushed the buyers on back foot. Besides, post-demonetisation people are shying away from buying gold," he said. 
 
 Another jeweller said that the business was not up to his expectations. "The impact of demonetisation is clearly visible on the trade. People are buying jewellery only for token. There are very few takers for heavy jewelleries," he said.
 
 Rajendra  , president of  , also said that the market did not see a heavy demand on Friday. "But, one cannot say that it is disappointing. We believe that city might have seen a turnover of Rs 6-7 crore on Friday," he said. 
 
 Mundalik said that the   has diluted the excitement of the buyers. "Many customers have cut their budget as the prices have gone up," he said.
