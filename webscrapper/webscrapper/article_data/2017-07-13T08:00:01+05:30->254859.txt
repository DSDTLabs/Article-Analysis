MUMBAI: The   (CoA) is concerned by the move on part of the   (CAC) to go beyond its brief on the subject of selecting India's national coach.

 
 
 
 The CoA had advised the   to invite applications only for the post of India's national coach. There was no mention whatsoever of either inviting applications for any other role and no mandate was given to the CAC to select bowling and batting consultants. "We are going to be looking at this very seriously. They have clearly gone beyond the brief," a CoA member told TOI. For more than a decade, it has been the national coach's responsibility to pick a support staff of his choice, as was the case with   and his successors   and  . However, in selecting Shastri for the role, the CAC ­ or rather certain members of it ­ insisted that additional consultants be picked to work with the cricketer-turned-commentator.
 
 While Zaheer hasn't announced his retirement yet from domestic cricket, considering he was part of the   squad in the IPL, Dravid was recently appointed coach of India's junior national teams. Dravid's new responsibilities include the following: coach of India 'A' team, coach of under-19 team and batting consultant with senior team on overseas tours. In what is being seen as a show of one-upmanship, there are those in the fraternity who believe certain CAC members simply wanted to show Shastri who the boss is.
