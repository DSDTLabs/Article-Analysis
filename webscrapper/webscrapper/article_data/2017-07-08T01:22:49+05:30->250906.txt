NEW DELHI: Even as India Foundation cancelled its delegation's visit to China after denial of visa by Beijing to two of the researchers, its director and   national general secretary   clarified on Friday that he was neither denied visa nor was he to head the delegation. 

 "I was not in the delegation. It was supposed to be an academic delegation. After the denial of visa to two researchers, the Foundation called off the visit," clarified Madhav in a tweet. 
 
  His office had earlier stated that Madhav wasn't required to apply as his Chinese visa is valid till November, 2017. "Madhav had gone to attend the   summit in China in June this year and he was given visa for six months," said researcher at India Foundation, Priyang Pandey, who had accompanied Madhav during the visit. 
 
  A delegation of five researchers was to leave for Fudan University in   on Monday for two days under academic exchange programme with the varsity. However, China declined visa to two of the researchers and allowed three others. "They (Chinese officials) have not cited any reason for denial of visa," Pandey said. tnn
