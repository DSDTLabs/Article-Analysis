NEW DELHI:   lost his sister to a drunk driver but he has still come out in favour of modifying the Supreme Court's   saying it shouldn't affect "respectable establishments" and their employees.

 Vadra's sister Michelle Vadra was killed by a drunk driver on the Delhi-Jaipur highway in April 2001. And on April 1 this year, the Supreme Court's order 
  on state and national highways came into effect. 
 
 "It will be a big step forward towards road safety. Having lost my own sister (she was just 33) in an unfortunate accident caused by callousness towards safety norms on the roads, I fully endorse the shutting of liquor vends along the highways," wrote Vadra, who's Congress leader  's son-in-law, on Facebook.
 
 Still, Vadra, in his post, batted strongly in favour of modifications to the Supreme Court's order.
 
 
 
 
 "...some respectable establishments might be adversely affected while having a record of adhering to rules and not allowing patrons/ customers to exceed limits of consumption," wrote Vadra, who is  's husband. 
 
 He said the hospitality industry "will be hit badly" and its approximately one million employees might be affected. 
 
 "According to media reports, some vendors are selling liquor surreptitiously. This defeats the purpose of the order; it may also will lead to corruption & black marketing of liquor," he said.
 
 Vadra emphasized that safety requirements should still be enforced and stringently.
  
 "I hope some modifications in the order are considered and introduced in the future to prevent the loss of jobs and damage to the industry while still enforcing safety requirements with strictness,"
 he wrote.
 
 As many as 100 restaurants, liquor vends and bars - including in five star hotels - along the Capital region's six national highways stopped serving alcohol April 1. In Noida, 42 liquor stores no longer sell booze. In Gurugram, 106 of a 292 highway bars and vends have stopped selling or serving alcoholic drinks.
