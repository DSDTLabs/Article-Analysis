Panaji: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has asked chief minister Manohar Parrikar to decide about his choice of constituency to contest the byelection in order to get himself elected as member of the legislative assembly.   has zeroed down on Panaji and Curchorem constituencies for Parrikar to contest the byelection.

 Speaking to STOI, BJP state unit president Vinay Tendulkar said that BJP has asked Parrikar to take a final decision on the matter and the party’s core committee is likely to meet in this regard soon. “Parrikar has been asked to tell us about his choice of constituency,” said a senior BJP leader of the core committee.
 
 “We have shortlisted Panaji and Curchorem, but Parrikar should be comfortable to contest there and he has to take a call on it,” the senior BJP leader said. Parrikar has to get elected as a member of the Goa legislative assembly within six months in order to continue as the chief minister of the state.
 
 Parrikar has started consultations with BJP workers in Panaji and also held a meeting with Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral. Parrikar, on Thursday, held a meeting with the BJP’s Panaji block, councillors of the Corporation of the City of Panaji, workers and supporters and discussed about the byelection. Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienkar was also present at the meeting. BJP sources said that Parrikar told Panaji BJP workers that the party’s workers in Curchorem have also asked him to contest the byelection from Curchorem. Sources said that Parrikar told the Panaji BJP workers that he will take a decision shortly. 
 
 Kuncalienkar and Cabral have already offered to vacate their seats to allow Parrikar to contest the by-election.
 
 In November 2014, Parrikar resigned as member of Goa’s legislative assembly and chief minister of the state to become the defence minister of the country. Parrikar has won the Panaji seat since 1994.
