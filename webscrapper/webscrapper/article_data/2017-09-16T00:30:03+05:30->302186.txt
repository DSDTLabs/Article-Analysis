Bhopal: Every time you buy 1 litre of petrol, you are forced to shell out Rs 20 as tax to the state government. Even farmers aren’t spared — they have to cough up Rs 14 as tax on every litre of diesel.

 And to make it worse for already burdened consumers, the government has been increasing the tax year on year. This revelation — in an RTI reply — comes at a time when questions are being raised over why fuel prices are rising in the country when crude prices have crashed.
 
 Replying to an RTI query by Neemuch-based activist Chandrashekhar Guar, the commercial tax department of Madhya Pradesh has informed that Rs 8,900 crore was earned as revenue from tax on petroleum products in 2016-17. In 2011-12, this figure was less than half — at Rs 4,202 crore, the reply says.
 
 Interestingly, the commercial tax department has said that the increase was not due to more consumption of petroleum products in the state, but due to hike in tax. While the earnings of the state government from petroleum doubled in five years, consumption of petroleum products increased by just 33% — from 4259167 kilo litres in 2011-12 to 5698263 kilolitres in 2016-17. 
 
 The same reply reveals that average tax levied by the state government on petrol and diesel in 2011-12 was Rs 14 and Rs 8 respectively. But over the course of five years, it was increased to Rs 20 and Rs 14 on petrol and diesel by 2016-17. 
 
 An official on condition of anonymity said that as of now tax levied on petroleum products is 31% of the value plus Rs 4 per litre. This adds up to more than Rs 20 per litre on petrol, said sources. 
 
 “Tax should be made inversely proportion to crude oil. If prices increase, then taxes should come down automatically. Petro products should also be brought under the GST umbrella. Prices should essentially come down so that citizens are not adversely affected,” Guar told TOI, adding: “Petro products are essential commodities and they should not be treated merely as a source of income only.”
