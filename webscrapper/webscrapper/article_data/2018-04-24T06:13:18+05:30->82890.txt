AMRITSAR: Missing Amritsar boy  , 24, who had sent the security forces here into tizzy after his mysterious disappearance in Pakistan had been enjoying hospitality of his FB friend.

 According to sources, Amarjit had befriended   resident   over FB. After reaching Pakistan on April 12, Amarjit called Razak over phone, who invited him to stay at his place. The sources further said that Amarjit lied to Razak that he had a three-month visa whereas his visa expiry date was April 21. He spent three days at Razak’s house enjoying his family’s hospitality. It was when Razak read the news about Amarjit’s disappearance on social media that he alerted the Pakistan Evacuee Trust Property Board officials, who took Amarjit in custody.
 
 A resident of Niranjanpura village near Amritsar, Amarjit had gone to Pakistan, along with a Sikh jatha on April 12 to celebrate Baisakhi. However, he didn’t return with the jatha, triggering speculations that he could have been brain-washed by Sikh radicals or he might have some female friend in Pakistan. After Hoshiarpur woman Kiran Bala embarced Islam and married a Lahore man, the ETPB had begun keeping strict record of every Indian pilgrim.
 
 The sources stated that according to ETPB records, Amarjit had left for Lahore from Nankana Sahib, from where he went to Sheikhupura. They further said that Amarjit could be deported to India on Tuesday.
