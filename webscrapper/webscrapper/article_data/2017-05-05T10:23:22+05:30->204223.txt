SONIPAT: A 52-year-old   committed suicide at   after posting a note on Facebook. 

 ASI Virender Singh first tied a rope to a ceiling fan and placed the noose around his neck. He then shot himself with his service revolver. The body was found hanging. 
 
 In his suicide note on Facebook, he held a Sonipat municipal official and his brother responsible for his taking the extreme step. He alleged that the two had implicated him in a case after which he was transferred to the district lines on a penal posting. 
 
 That particular incident had occurred on April 15 when Singh and his team had gone to attend a complaint filed by the official’s brother against another brother. Though the matter was sorted out, Singh and a head constable were accused of using force. “The complaint was referred to a DSP at the headquarters, who ordered the transfer. He was sent there on April 27. It was pretty routine. I didn’t know that he was so sensitive,” said a police officer. 
 
 “He was sent to the police lines and made to feel guilty of a crime he didn’t commit,” said Surajmal, Singh’s uncle. Singh’s family also said he was very depressed after the case and had attempted suicide once before. 
 
 Murthal police station SHO Rambeer said he was out on patrol duty and didn’t know how it happened. “There were very few people inside the police station when the incident occurred. I learnt about it around 8am from a constable. Nobody heard the gunshot as the police station is situated in a busy area,” he said. 
 
 In the Facebook post, Singh wrote “please investigate”, an appeal to the police perhaps, and concluded with “I can’t be alive”. 
 
 Based on the post, a case of abetment to suicide has been registered against three people at Murthal police station.
