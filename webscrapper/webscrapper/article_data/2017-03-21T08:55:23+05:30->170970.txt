PUNE: It was a day to remember for 90 World War II widows, who were felicitated by the Satara-based Sainik Women’s Self Help group on Sunday.

 The felicitation took place in front of an audience of 1,000  . The women of the hour hailed from Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Raigad districts.
 
 The function was held to remember and celebrate the contributions of their husbands in the war, and also to hear about issues related to pensions and medical facilities. 
 
 Speaking to TOI over the phone, 80-year-old Indubai Nikam said, “It was a nice gesture ... at this stage of our lives, few pay attention to us, but there are people who respect soldiers’ contributions. This function stands testimony to the fact.”
 
 “Many of these widows do not get pensions or free medical treatment at military hospitals/ Ex-servicemen   (ECHS), as their husbands had been sent home over demobilization, without pension. The state government has granted them Rs3,000 as pension, but it is barely enough,” said Captain Udaji Nikam (retd). 
 
 The SHG was established in 2007 with the sole aim of empowering war widows and addressing their issues related to pensions and health facilities.
 
 The group’s convener,  , is of the opinion that the Centre should pay heed to the widows’ issues, and a minimum pension be paid to them in the future.
 
 “Many widows face health issues due to their advanced age, and so the Centre should take concrete steps and provide for their medical facilities at least. That way, at this stage of life, they will not have to suffer anymore,” Nikam said.
 
 The members of the group come together at least once a month to discuss and deliberate on topics of health, nutrition, education, and job opportunities for their children and/or grandchildren.
