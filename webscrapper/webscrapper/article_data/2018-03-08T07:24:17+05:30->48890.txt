GORAKHPUR: Former chief minister and   national president Akhilesh   launched a scathing attack on UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath over his recent statement, wherein he referred to the party’s arrangement with the   (BSP) for the state byelections as ‘saanp-chachunder ka saath(company of snakes and rodents)’.

 Addressing a public meeting in Gorakhpur, on Wednesday, where he was campaigning for SP candidate for the   bypoll Praveen  ,   accused Yogi of describing members of backward communities and dalits as snakes and rodents.
 
 
 President of Peace Party Dr Mohamed Ayub and members of Nishad party were also present at the meeting.
 
 Calling the byelection a wake-up call for the public, Akhilesh said the ‘seat’ had become vacant for after a long time and the bypoll was unique as it was the first time in the history that communities like the Nishads, OBCs, Dalits and Muslims had come together.
 
 Addressing the audience, Yadav said, “This is a wakeup call for the public as the seat has become vacant after a long time (ye seat badi mushkil se khali hui hai). It is for the first time that (OBCs, Nishads, Muslims, Dalits and Communists) have come together so don’t take this election very lightly as it is a very special one. If you do not wake up this time no one will fight your battle for you.”
