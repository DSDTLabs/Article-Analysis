Like all his previous films, music is an integral part of his latest venture, too. The filmmaker says, “I started work on 'EHTEDT' only after composer Nadeem (of Nadeem-Shravan fame) created some fascinating scores for me.” 
 
 Suneel’s last outing was in 2014, as the producer of 'Karle Pyaar Karle'. Talking about the three-year-gap, he says, “I wanted to make a film keeping today’s times in mind, yet work on an area which is timeless. The story of 'EHTEDT' has been on my mind for some time now; I decided to develop the screenplay much later. Once this film releases, I will start work on two more interesting subjects.”
