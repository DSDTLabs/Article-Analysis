MANGALURU: Seems the public will have to wait for some more time to make payments at the much sought-after Mangalore One centres. Though the staff punched in at the office in time on Sunday, they were in for a shock as their systems had been deactivated. The staff at all the six Mangalore One centres on Saturday had decided to resume work as usual after a fruitful discussion between INTUC that represented Mangalore One staff, government officials and  , the company that employs   One workers. 

 A staff at one of the prominent centres told TOI that they sent back at least 200 customers on Sunday, as they weren't able to login to their systems. When any staff member, including the manager, tried logging into the system, it didn't allow them to do so, displaying the message 'your account has been locked'.
 
 The workers allege it is a ploy by CMS to terminate their services. "Some time ago, a representative from CMS had visited the centre, demanding our signatures on a few documents. We weren't allowed to read those documents. He asked us our decision on issues, to which we sought time," said one of the workers.
 
 "After the labour inspector spoke to the vice-president of CMS on Saturday, and it was conveyed to us that our demands will be met after elections, we decided to resume work as usual. We reached office on time on Sunday, however, none of us were able to login to our systems. We sent back at least 200 customers from this centre alone," she said, adding that media reports stating that services will resume on Sunday, had brought back customers into the centres.
 
 On the other hand, two centres of Mangalore One-at   and the   office in Lalbagh - have been shut down as   has cut power supply because of non-payment of electricity bills. The outstanding electricity bill of the Surathkal branch is Rs 1,12,000 and Lalbagh branch is Rs 1,98,000.
