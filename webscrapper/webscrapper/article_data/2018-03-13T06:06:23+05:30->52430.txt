HYDERABAD: In a new development that has caught many by surprise, the state government has now decided to penalise district education officers (DEOs) and invigilators in case students indulge in copying during Class 10 (SSC)   to begin from March 15.

 
 Through a circular released recently, the   (DGE) has indicated that DEOs/ MEOs (mandal education officers) and invigilators will be personally held accountable for any copying that takes place at any centre under their jurisdiction and disciplinary action will be initiated against them for the same. 
  
 
 
 
 “The DEOs and MEOs would be held accountable for any copying which take place at the examination centres within their jurisdiction,” read the circular. It further stated: “Each invigilator, at every exam centre, shall be informed in writing that he/she would be personally held accountable for any copying which takes place in their centre. The DEOs and MEOs are instructed to register complaints against both the examiner at the centres and the students who have indulged in copying under the Telangana   (Act no 25 of 1997).”
 
 
 Speaking about this move,  , DGE said: “We are just following the orders of the High Court and will take action as per the regulations.” The explanation, however, failed to convince DEOs who said that the decision made no sense. “We will definitely take all measures to make sure that the exams are held in a fair and transparent manner. However, we can’t be held responsible for every individual case. If there are instances of  , then we don’t mind taking responsibility,” said a DEO on condition of anonymity.
 
 
 Teachers aired similar concerns. “Just because they have to submit a report to the High Court after examinations, they cannot make us scapegoats,” said Raghunandan E, a teacher.
