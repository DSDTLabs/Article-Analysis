KOLKATA: All Metro stations have subways for passengers to cross streets safely, but   has proposed   (FOBs) outside all stations between Mahanayak Uttam Kumar and Belgachia. On Friday, mayor Sovan Chatterjee met officials at the   headquarters and a decision was taken to create a joint team to study the plan. The team will comprise KMC, Metro and transport department officials. 

 According to a senior KMC official, the mayor suggested FOBs outside stations to prevent accidents. While people can cross streets through Metro subways, large crowds can be seen waiting outside most stations during peak hours to cross busy streets. The experts will study where FOBs are possible. While KMC is keen on FOBs, existing ones in places like Sealdah, Ultadanga and Ballygunge haven't been effective in curbing jaywalking. 
 
 "A panel has been set up to study where FOBs will be effective. Friday's meeting was to review ongoing work. Apart from the mayor, it was attended by Metro general manager M C Chauhan and Kolkata Police and RVNL officers. Chauhan pointed to the pending NOC for construction of a ventilation shaft for the East-West Metro at  . A couple of hours after the meeting, the NOC was issued by KMC. The mayor and the GM discussed the FOBs, after which the panel was set up," said  , CPRO, Metro Railway. 
 
  "There are busy streets like C R Avenue that people prefer to cross after leaving Metro stations. We want to prevent accidents and traffic congestion here. It will be a help if FOBs are constructed," a police officer said. 
 
 According to Banerjee, the joint team will decide where FOBs can be built and ways to prevent disruption in services once construction starts.
