AHMEDABAD: The startling finding of a study reveals that around 70% of urban women in Gujarat are deficient in vitamin D. The study was conducted across three cities in Gujarat namely, Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat, with a sample size of 35,000 women, by   (SDC). A similar study was also conducted in 2012, according to which around 85% women from urban Gujarat were Vitamin D deficient, which declined to 70% in 2016.

  While the deficiency of the sunshine vitamin is commonly ignored, it can lead to serious repurcussions, believe medical practitioners. These include osteoporosis and lower bone mineral density thus increasing one’s risk for fracture. In fact, the study has linked Vitamin D with obesity, high blood pressure, type-2 diabetes, depression, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome.
 
 “Vitamin D deficiency is more of a lifestyle disorder and is arguably one of the most ignored issues of modern times. While most patients are aware about disorders such as diabetes and heart health, few are aware about  , which in the long run is likely to affect their quality of life,” said Dr   of SDC, who was part of the group that conducted the study.
 
 “While the number of cases have gone down, they are still startling and increased awareness may help deal with it effectively,” he added.
 
 The study also indicates that most women found to be vitamin D deficient fall in the age group below 30 years. Long working hours and less exposure to morning sunlight are common reasons for rising number of cases of vitamin D deficiency.
 
 Sharing further insights, Dr  , a city-based gynaecologist, said, “Several young women who have fertility issues and disorders such as Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) are observed to have vitamin D deficiencies. Studies have recorded these observations among women.”
 
 In fact lactating and pregnant women also tend to be adversely impacted with vitamin D deficiencies, as the body’s requirement tends to go up.
