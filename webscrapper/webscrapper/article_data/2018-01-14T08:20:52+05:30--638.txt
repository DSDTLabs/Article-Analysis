LUCKNOW: It’s been as many as 15 days since the last DGP of   retired but the post is lying vacant despite his successor being decided. The appointment of DGP-designate OP Singh is still under consideration of the appointments committee of cabinet ( ) headed by Prime Minister   for his premature repatriation to home cadre Uttar Pradesh.

 A premature repatriation to home cadre requires the approval of the ACC while those completing their central deputation are repatriated automatically after departmental approval.
 
 The delay in Singh’s repatriation has given rise to speculation about the Centre examining his records and performance during his central deputation.
 
 This is the first time when the police department of the country’s most populated state has remained headless for so long, with lower rung police personnel asked to manage law and order.
 
 Outgoing state police chief   demitted office on December 30, a day before his retirement on December 31to pave way for his successor.
 
 By the same night, the government had announced the name of OP Singh, the director general of CISF.
 
 Sources in the government say Singh’s name for the top post was a surprise as, initially, speculations were strong that   chief Rajnikant Mishra might take over from Sulkhan. But, Singh was chosen superseding six of his seniors.
 
 Sources also say it was probably the lack of coordination between Lucknow and Delhi which resulted in the delay in approval of his file from the ACC. “This is an embarrassment for the state government as this delay is unprecedented,” said a senior functionary of UP IPS Association.
