How far are you willing to go to satisfy your hunger pangs? Whatever you have in mind, it is unlikely to surpass the stunt this peckish pilot pulled.

 Residents in the vicinity of a McDonald's in Sydney were stunned when a helicopter landed right in front of the fast food joint on Saturday, Mail Online reported.
 
 They were even more taken aback when they saw the pilot jauntily leave the helicopter, its blades still whirring, and head into the restaurant, before returning with a bag of takeaway.
 
 The bizarre incident was caught on camera by bystanders who couldn't quite believe what they'd just witnessed.
 
 "Oh for real? I thought it was an emergency," an observer remarks as the pilot gets into the chopper and flies away with his grub.
 
 
 
 According to Australian media reports, landing the helicopter is not illegal but the   is investigating the incident.
 
 The agency said that as long as the pilot had the permission of the land owner, he could technically use it to land his aircraft as long as it was safe.
 
 A man who claimed to be the pilot of the chopper spoke to a local radio network in Sydney and said he'd got the owner's permission to land on his property.
 
 "Every now and then we do that sort of stuff," the man was reported as saying by 9 News  .
