 Azad said, “As of now, we are working on the recommendations of the screening committee for all the 403 seats in the state. What happens in future will only be known later. There is a lot of pressure on secular parties.” 
 
 Azad, who attended the party’s executive committee meeting, said, “The 36-member state election committee will meet here from tomorrow for three days in which names of the candidates will be finalised.” 
 
 On Tuesday, UPCC chief Raj Babbar also refused comment on the SP feud saying that it was an internal warring best settled within the family, and without political commentary. The party’s chief ministerial face Sheila Dikshit also said there was likely to be clarity on Congress’s alliance plans within the next few days. 
 
 In New Delhi, while Dikshit said she would follow the orders of the high command and step aside to accommodate young blood if needed, Congress leaders maintained they were in favour of secular forces coming together in order to curtail BJP’s growth in poll-bound UP.
