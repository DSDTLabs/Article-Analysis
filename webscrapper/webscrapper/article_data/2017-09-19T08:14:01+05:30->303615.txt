INDORE: The Indore bench of high court on Monday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of a 23-year-old man, who was accused of eve teasing and molesting a girl in a gym in   area of the city. 

 The video of the brawl had gone viral and the victim had filed an FIR against Punit   under Section 356 of IPC which involved charges of assault or criminal force on a woman to outrage her modesty. 
 
 Three other charges of shouting obscenities (Section 294), criminal intimidation (Section 506) and voluntarily causing hurt (Section 323) were also pressed against Punit. While all of these offences are bailable, the offence under Section 354 is non bailable. 
 
 FIR had been registered at Bhanwarkuan police station on August 18, the same day as the incident happened and the accused had been absconding ever since. 
 
 “The accused through his counsel had earlier moved an anticipatory bail plea before the session court which was dismissed by the court after which he moved the high court,” advocate  , counsel to the victim’s parents said. 
 
 Justice   heard the matter on Monday and rejected the bail application, paving way for Malvi’s arrest. 
 
 Twenty three-year-old Punit Malvi was allegedly troubling the woman while she was working out which triggered an argument and he thrashed her. The entire incident was recorded on CCTVs. The youth was seen pushing and kicking the girl and shouting at her while the others tried to calm him down. The girl works as a teacher and was known to the accused.
