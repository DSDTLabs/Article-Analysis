TRICHY: The city corporation on Wednesday launched a novel initiative whereby the authorities distribute electric kettles as reward to four lucky residents who carries out source segregation at their houses. The effort is expected to encourage the segregation of waste at source familiar among the residents,

 The Urban Local Body ( ) officials citing the entries received from denizens said that the response among the residents for the contest was heavy and has planned to carry the same every week at least for a year. 
 
 Unlike the door-to-door waste collection in which sanitary workers receive both biodegradable and non-biodegradable all together, ULB has been receiving biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes separately since June 2017. The civic body has last week promised to give an electric kettle each to four residents every week on condition that they send a minute-long video on source segregation to the civic body.
 
 The video could be sent to corporation’s official via WhatsApp number 83001-13000 and uploading into   simultaneously by tagging three of their friends with hashtag #MyTrichyChallenge.
 
 Among the entries received, the civic body would draw lots to select the residents for the 1.8 litre capacity electric kettle worth Rs 1,000. In the inaugural week of the initiative the ULB gave away the kettles to T S Venkateshwaran, Ponnammal, Jansi, and  .
 
 “We have planned to draw lots every week for a year. Sponsors have been identified for the initiative to boost   practice,” Corporation commissioner   said.
 
 Earlier, the civic body has been awarding a gram gold coin each to the residents successfully segregating the waste. However, due to administrative reasons, the first-of-its kind initiative in the entire state was dropped by the civic body.
