NEW DELHI: Ongoing protests against the new regulations of University Grants Commission for MPhil and PhD courses have also reached the Delhi   court.

 Recently, the court sought response of   on a PIL challenging these regulations that also govern appointment of teaching staff.
 
 A bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal issued   to UGC and sought its stand on the issues raised in the petition which has urged the court’s intervention on the ground that the new regulations would adversely affect those teaching in ad-hoc capacity in colleges and varsities across the country.
 
 According to the petitioner NGO Forum of Indian Legists, 50% of the teaching strength of Delhi University is of ad-hoc teachers and as per the 2016 regulations, PhD and MPhil degree holders who were earlier exempted from the National Eligibility Test (NET) for appointment as teaching staff, have been made ineligible to continue where they work in ad-hoc capacity as the exam is a pre-requisite for appointment now.
 
 The NGO petitioner has also claimed that those who got PhD degrees prior to 2009 and with several years of experience have also been made ineligible due to the new regulations.
 
 The petition also challenges the minimum standards and procedure for award of PhD and MPhil degrees set out in the 2016 regulations, saying that under it scholars have to publish one article based on their research in a refereed journal, a list of which was only released after January 2017.
 
 “Due to this, all MPhil dissertations and PhD thesis submitted between July 2009 and January 2017 in any university and any degree awarded thereon have become invalid,” the petition has alleged.
 
 The court has listed the matter for further hearing on July 19. The latest regulations have also led to protests in JNU where a section of students have been staging demonstrations in front of the VC office.
