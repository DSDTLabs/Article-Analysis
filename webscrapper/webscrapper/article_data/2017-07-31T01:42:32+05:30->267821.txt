NEW DELHI: A shortage of fruits and   may hit the city with several   at   threatening to go on an indefinite   from Monday. The protest is against the government’s decision to reallocate   sheds with a section of traders blaming another group of illegal occupation of these facilities. 

 “About 85-90% of the mandi is likely to be shut. Some commission agents may continue to operate but almost everyone has promised to join in. We informed growers about Monday’s strike last week. Trucks that were due to arrive at the mandi on Sunday night or early Monday won’t come,” said Metha Ram Kriplani, a vegetable trader.
 
 Last week, after meeting both groups that have been blaming each other of encroachment, development minister Gopal Rai had announced that the reallocation would be done based on the market fees submitted by traders over the past three years. 
 
 “There is a cartel that needs to be broken. The government had earlier seen a similar problem with onion and potato traders and was successful in breaking those,” said a senior official. As far as Monday’s strike is concerned, he said, it is being done by a small section of traders and the government is not anticipating any severe disruption. 
 
 The section of traders that has called the strike said the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) had sent a notice to the other side, saying they should vacate seven tomato and three mausambi sheds that they had illegally occupied. “If there was a genuine misunderstanding, why would APMC issue them the notice? It is a clear proof that even the government found those traders in the wrong. In that case, why is there a reallocation of sheds?” asked a trader.
 
 The strike, if it is as severe as traders claim it would be, may impact availability of fruits and vegetables and their price. The city is already witnessing a sharp rise in prices of tomatoes and onions due to reduced supply during the monsoon.
