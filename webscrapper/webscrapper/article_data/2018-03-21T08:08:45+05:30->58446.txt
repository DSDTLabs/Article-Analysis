 "The signals have not been working making it a difficult to pass through the junction. For pedestrians, the situation is even much worse," said commuter P Senthil.
 
 According to residents, several representations to the traffic department went unanswered. "The situation is really dangerous during peak hours. More than ten of us registered complaints but no action has been initiated," rued Arasu, a resident of VGP Nagar.
 
 A personnel from the traffic enforcement wing said the issue was due to a technical glitch. Work to fix the same is being undertaken.
