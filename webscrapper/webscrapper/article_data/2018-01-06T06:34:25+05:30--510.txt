MALDA: For the first time in several decades, a marsh crocodile was spotted in the Ganga at   in Malda. The state forest department is keeping a close watch on the reptile. 

  The 10-ft long crocodile was recently spotted by a group of birders from Kolkata and Malda as it was basking in the sun on the river bank. Two days later, the forest chief conservator was informed and a monitoring team was formed. Divisional forest officer   said, "We've been constantly monitoring the area. The visibility over the river is very poor due to thick fog."
 
 Wildlife enthusiast   said, "It is no doubt a remarkable incident. Crocodile was seen in the Ganges about 60 years ago. Since then, some gharials were spotted, but no crocodiles. We have to ascertain how it came here."
 
 Wildlife researcher and conservationist   said: "After the construction of the Farakka barrage, the water flow in the downstream of the Ganges has improved. Probably, it has come from the upstream." According to him, there was a reported sighting of a marsh crocodile near Murshidabad more than three years ago.
 
 Animal lovers throng the area for its rich biodiversity comprising dolphin, gharial, otter, wild boar and a variety of migratory birds from Asia and Europe that visit during winter. Now, the marsh crocodile has added a new feather in the cap.
