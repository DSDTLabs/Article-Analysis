Panaji: Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Shantaram Naik, on Saturday termed the anti-corruption branch (ACB) raids on the premises of opposition leader and Congress’ Quepem MLA Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar, “politically motivated, malicious and aimed at compelling Congress legislators to join the BJP under duress.” “Although no complaint has come to me about any coercion, information emanating from certain sources is scary as MLAs are being threatened with action if they don’t toe the BJP line,” Naik said at a press conference in Panaji. Alleging that fascist ideologies were at work, the GPCC president said an atmosphere is being created to compel Congress MLAs join the BJP. “This is not going to happen as they will not quit the party,” said Naik. “The Quepem MLA’s premises were raided on four occasions since 2010. At no stage of the investigation has he denied any information to investigators. The probe agencies have always given an impression that they are satisfied with his cooperation,’’ Naik said, adding, “If the land purchased by Kavlekar in Kerala is an issue, then its valuation can be done in no time. The agencies had done it long back. The Congress party suspects this is a new method of government formation by the BJP.”
