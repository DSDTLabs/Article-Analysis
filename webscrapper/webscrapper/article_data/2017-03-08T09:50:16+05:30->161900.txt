TARN TARAN: The   has opened various   to impart skills to the youth and help them find jobs to become financially independent. Around 1,500 youths, mostly girls, are learning various vocational skills at 11 centres started by the administration,   deputy commissioner D P S   told TOI on Tuesday. 

 “The results are amazing. A girl trained in tailoring can stitch a school uniform in an hour and earn Rs 60,” said Kharbanda. The district administration is also helping trained youths in getting uniform stitching contracts from government and private schools. It has helped in providing loans for buying motorized sewing machines or kits at subsidized rates, he added. 
 
 After completing training, many youths were successfully running their own businesses and had even provided employment to others. “Those who have set up their businesses are earning around Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 per month with bank loan instalment of Rs 10 per day only,” said Kharbanda. 
 
 A loan of Rs 15,000 was arranged under differential rate of interest scheme, which, Kharbanda said, was enough to purchase a carpentry, AC repair and mobile phone repair kits. “In villages, one can take a shop on rent and buy a repair kit to start business with this much amount,” he added.
 
 Harinder Kaur, a local resident, who is successfully running her tailoring business, said she charged Rs 35 and Rs 25 for stitching a trouser and shirt, respectively, and earned up to Rs 500 a day. “This is better than any government job. It is my own business and there is a sea of opportunities,” she maintained.
 
 Training is also imparted in mobile and AC repair, bee-keeping and welding among other vocations.
