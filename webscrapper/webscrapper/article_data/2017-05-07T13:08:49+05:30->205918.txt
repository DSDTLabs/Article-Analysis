KOHIMA: In a state battling conflict on many fronts, human trafficking continues unabated. Police data shows that one person goes missing every fourth day in the state, the   ( ) said. 

 Of these cases, 83% pertain to people below the age of 18, NSCW chairperson   said. She was speaking at a legal awareness programme on human trafficking, organized by the NSCW and the National Commission for Women, here on Friday. Human trafficking has afflicted India and the northeast is one of the most vulnerable regions in the country in this respect,   said. One of the primary motives behind cases of human trafficking remains sex trafficking, followed by slavery and organ harvesting, she added.
 
 Attributing the continuance of the practice to lack of awareness about the concept of human trafficking itself, Ao said parents who willingly send out their children are unwittingly participating in human trafficking without even realizing that it amounts to. "Other agents take advantage of their ignorance and get groups of minors who are then sold off," she added. Lack of concrete information and non-reporting of crimes pose further problems.
 
 It is for this reason that NSCW has been conducting legal awareness programmes since March; these programmes will continue till the end of May 2017, Ao said. Customary laws are not well-equipped to deal with such practices and police have to play a role in preventing trafficking, she added, while pointing out the need to establish proper links between police, child rights agencies, the labour department, the social welfare department, mental health agencies and NGOs to prevent human trafficking.
