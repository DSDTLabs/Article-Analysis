Chandigarh: A day after INLD MP Dushyant Chautala alleged scam in procurement of medicines and usables by the Haryana health department, health minister Anil Vij on Monday ordered special audit into local purchase of medicines in all the 22 districts of the state. 

 Vij said the “government had distributed Rs 87.60 crore under the Mukhyamantri Muft Ilaaj Yojana and National Health Mission from 2014 to 2017, of which only Rs 40.89 crore was spent”. Maintaining that the government was duty-bound to take strict action against all the wrongdoers and those indicted in the probe, the minister said he had also directed the team of drug control department to conduct raids on Gee Kay traders, which had allegedly supplied medicines in Rewari and other district districts. “Apart from this, all civil surgeons have been directed to purchase online products available on Government-e-Marketplace portal of the Union government,” he said.
