 Filmmakers often face trouble from the   (CBFC) and political outfits if a movie has a political background. Mehta, however, said he does not get bothered by such pressure. 
 
 In an interview with , Mehta said, "I am never bothered about it. 'The Accidental Prime Minister' is in early stages of development. It is an important film and the idea is to make it in a very balanced manner." 
 
 Actor   will play the role of the former prime minister in the movie. The 2014 memoir gives a detailed account of Singh's tenure (2004-2014) and an insight into the Indian political scenario during those years. The film, slated to release later next year, will be directed by debutant Vijay Ratnakar Gutte. 
 
 Mehta is excited about his upcoming directorial venture 'Omerta'. The film chronicles the story of the British-born terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who kidnapped and murdered Wall Street Journal reporter   in 2002. "'Omerta' is a political thriller and it had its world premier in Toronto. It is explosive and can be controversial. But I am not shying away from it," said the director. 
 
 Mehta adds that be it 'Shahid' or now 'Omerta', he has never struggled to find like-minded people, who support a true story and not shy away from taking risks. "I have never struggled to find like-minded people, who would support your vision wholeheartedly and give the film as much love as you would give it. Money is the by-product. You need people to invest in your ideas." 
 
 The makers are planning to release 'Omerta' later this year or early next year.
