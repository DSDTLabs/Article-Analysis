KOLKATA:   will soon follow the   model to get rid of  . The   (NDITA) has taken the initiative to make the roads in the IT hub ‘wireless’ and, as the first step, has chalked out a plan to take up the stretch from   More to Ring Road via College More. 

 The authorities have been receiving complaints about dangerously hanging overhead cables and wires wrapped around the light poles on different stretches of the IT hub. A meeting was recently held with all cable operators of Sector V to come up with a solution and it was agreed that a committee would be formed to look into the issue. The authorities have identified the stretch starting from Wipro More to Ring Road via College More to start off the drive. 
 
 Some cable operators explained that almost 50% of the cables hanging from the poles were non-functioning. In case of faults, it was often easier to string in a new cable rather than locate and repair a fault in an overhead line.
 
  NDITA officials said the cable operators have shown their preference to follow the New Town model, where individual ducts have been provided to different companies. All operators will give their requirements to the committee within a week and the junction boxes would be covered within a fortnight. NDITA will arrange cable-drawing within the ducts. The field work is supposed to start within a few days.
 
  The New Town Telecom Infrastructure Development Corporation had laid underground cable ducts a long time back.
