PATNA: The state   on Thursday compared the   and subsequent murder of a Mahadalit girl Reena Kumari (name changed) at   hostel on January 7 to the Nirbhaya gang   incident in Delhi that had rocked the country around five years ago.

 The girl’s mother, who was here on Wednesday, had alleged that a teacher, a guard and five other people not only took turns to rape her daughter, but also killed her “barbarically”.
 
 “The case of gang rape and murder of the Class X girl student was inhuman, shocking and the one that defied all logic,” said state BJP vice-president Nivedita Singh, who visited Vaishali on Thursday along with others, including lawmakers Awadhesh Patel (Hajipur), Kedar Gupta (Kudhni) and Baby Kumari (Bochaha) as well as the party’s state functionaries Shyama Singh, Neelam Sahni, Bharti Suman Paswan and Anamika Shankar. 
 
 Nivedita said leader of opposition in the state assembly Prem Kumar had already discussed the matter with the Vaishali district civil and police administrations, while former deputy CM   would visit Vaishali on Friday.
 
 She said there was undeclared gag order as the efforts of the BJP team to collect information about the incident from the school staff and senior personnel of Ambedkar Kanya Vidyalya (Vaishali) as well as from the police and civil administrations proved futile. “We could elicit information only from the victim’s mother,” Nivedita said, adding that the probe team met the victim’s mother at her village home and discussed the matter with her in the presence of around 250 persons.
 
 The BJP has demanded deep investigation and arrest of the culprits involved in the incident, apart from Rs 20 lakh ex gratia to the next kin of the deceased.
