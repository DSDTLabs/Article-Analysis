TRICHY: Left with no option to prevent a clash between the warring factions of AIADMK in   over hoisting the party flag, the police finally decided to hoist the flag in the presence of both the factions. The incident happened at Karuvakurichi village in   in connection with the MGR birth centenary celebrations. 

 The celebrations were held separately by the AIADMK (Amma) led by   as well as the ruling party headed by chief minister  . As a result, the groups locked horns over the flag posts erected when the AIADMK was united. A section of Dhinakaran supporters hoisted their flag, which didn’t have the picture of former chief minister  , after removing the AIADMK flag on Thursday. 
 
 However, on Friday, the flag without Annadurai’s picture was removed by those belonging to the EPS faction so as to hoist the AIADMK flag.
 
 As the flag got damaged while being removed, Dhinakaran supporters got into heated arguments with EPS supporters and forcibly took off the AIADMK flag. As tempers frayed, inspector Jayanthi from the   police station limits arrived at the spot and held talks with either groups. 
 
 Since both the factions said they they would hoist their flag, the inspector said she would do it herself. She hoisted the AIADMK flag in common on behalf of both the factions.
