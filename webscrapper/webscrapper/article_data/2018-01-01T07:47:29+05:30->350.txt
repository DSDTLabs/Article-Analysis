KOLKATA: Jewellery worth Rs 8 lakh and Rs 25,000 in cash were stolen from a house at Jadavpur, between December 25 and 30, when the residents were on a trip to Kashmir. The valuables were, however, recovered on Saturday after a domestic help - who was later arrested - called in a tantrik. 

 The maid later confessed to the police that it was she, along with the driver, who had planned the burglary. The driver was also arrested.
 
 The victim,   Bhattacharya (45), a resident of  , left for Kashmir on December 23 along with his wife and son. His mother, however, chose to stay with her sister and left for her home at Andul, Howrah, on December 25.
 
 Upon his return on Saturday evening, Kaushik noticed that the collapsible gate was open. "I thought my mother might have forgotten to close it properly. However, I was surprised to find the front door ajar," the 45-year-old said.
 
 He quickly went in and turned on the lights to find the refrigerator moved from its usual place. He also saw that the television set was kept on the floor of the dining room. Suspecting a theft, when Kaushik went to the bedroom, he found the locks of the almirahs broken and the valuables missing. 
 
 There were more surprises awaiting him as one of their domestic helps took help of a tantrik, apparently to locate the missing items. 
 
 After the maid called the tantric, he said the jewellery and cash would be returned soon by the thieves. Hours after the tantric's 'prediction', a call came on the maid's mobile and the caller asked her to look for the stolen items downstairs. 
 
 When they rushed down, they found some of the jewellery kept in a packet hanging from Bhattacharya's son's bicycle. They alerted cops who interrogated the maid Dipti Mondal. She confessed to have helped Bhattacharya's driver in the theft. Cops are still trying to find out how the tantrik was involved.
