Ludhiana: The Union cabinet minister for food processing Harsimrat Badal has condemned the state government for removing some of the chapters from the Class XII book with portions of Sikh histiry while attending the convocation ceremony of Guru Nanak Engineering College on Gill Road on Tuesday. She also attacked the Congress government for poor law and order condition in the state and imposition of professional tax on residents. 

 While interacting with media persons Harsimrat Badal said after this step of the Congress government students will not be able to know about glorious history of Sikh gurus and other warriors. 
 
 She further stated that law and order condition in the state has deteriorated and crime rate has reached to a higher level with the government failing to curb it. Badal said, “Congressmen are threatening people for exhortion of properties and policemen have become mere spectators.” 
 
 She said the professional tax imposed on the people of Punjab should be named as ‘Manpreet Badal tax’. It was added that the move will prove fatal for Congress in the upcoming 2019 parliamentary elections and it will lose all seats. 
 
 While reacting to the rape cases in the country, especially involving minors, the Union minister said Central government has taken a right step by recommending capital punishment for rapists. She said even in judiciary system there is a need to implement it more stringently. However, she condemned the statements of deputy chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Kavinder Gupta who had termed Kathua rape case as minor incident and said leaders should not give such statements.
