Kolkata: Months before hanging his boots, President   told the audience at the IIM-Calcutta convocation that he would prefer to be called an “argumentative” Indian rather than an “intolerant” Indian.

 Sending out a message at a time when the country is caught in the ‘samshan-kabaristhan’ debate, the President said in his convocation address: “This is the land of Gautam Buddha, MK Gandhi and Chaitanya. We accept, adopt and embrace everyone and do not reject anybody.
 
 “Our academic environment and institutional atmosphere should be free from violence — not only physical but also from mental violence. Seats of our higher academic institutions are known for liberalism, confluence of ideas, thoughts, disciplines and views.”
 
 Encouraging the blooming of “hundred thoughts”, President   asked: “Why can’t there be various thoughts? If 100 flowers can bloom in a garden then why not thoughts?” According to him, seats of learning should have room for debate, disagreement and dissent but there should not be any confrontation or intolerance. “These are essential to reaching standards which we want to achieve in the global ranks. When the first three universities – University of Calcutta, University of Madras and   — were established through a charter, free thinking and liberal views were characteristics of higher learning. We should accept criticism. We can be argumentative but let us not be termed as intolerant.” 
 
 “At IIT-Kharagpur, five years back, when I had just taken over the office, I told them that not only in the IITs, but placements are excellent in the IIMs and NITs as well. It shows that there is no dearth of jobs for the graduates. I asked them: ‘How come the institutes that produce graduates who run the MNCs do not find any place on global rankings?” Now at the fag end of his term, Mukherjee feels reassured with many of these institutes finding international recognition. “The IITs are coming up to their rightful place in the rankings,” he added.
