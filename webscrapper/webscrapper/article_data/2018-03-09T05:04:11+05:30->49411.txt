MUMBAI: More allies will quit the BJP-led NDA in the near future, senior Shiv Sena leader   said on Thursday. The reaction was typically characteristic of the friction between the Sena and  .

 Raut, however, added that the TDP had in no way set a precedent for other NDA partners by asking its two Union ministers to resign from the Modi government. "In fact,   of the TDP has been inspired by the Sena,"   claimed. "The Sena has for long been clashing with the BJP on several issues. Uddhav Thacke- rayji has made it clear that the Sena will go solo in the next elections. This he had done much before the TDP asked its ministers in the Modi government to resign," he said.
 
 A section in the Sena is keen to see   make up his mind about stay- ing in the alliance. Matoshree's blow-hot-blow-cold approach has sown confusion in the party's rank and file, said observers. Raut, who sought to counter the impres- sion that the Sena is indecisive, said Thack- eray will order the party to quit the NDA at the "right time". But he ruled out chances of his party joining the federal front Beng- al CM Mamata Banerjee's leadership. "The Sena is not interested in either the third front or the federal front. We will toe our own line," he said.
