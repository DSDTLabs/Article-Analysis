SALIGAO: The narrow stretch of road leading to the famous   in Sinqueirm has been witnessing increasing traffic chaos of late, making the ride difficult for commuters. A large number of tourist vehicles, including big inter-state buses, move on this narrow stretch, thus leading to traffic snarls. 

 The peak domestic tourist season is in full swing and the large number of big inter-state tourist buses as well as other tourist vehicles often tend to park haphazardly on either side of the narrow stretch. . Local private tourist taxi drivers who park on the road while picking up or dropping off tourists from the nearby five-star hotels also add to the chaos.
 
 Two-wheeler riders, in particular, have a tough time maneuvering their vehicles due to the resultant traffic congestion.
 
 Speaking to TOI, a local who did not want to be identified, said that the authorities concerned need to undertake the task of widening of the road on a priority basis as this will help ease the traffic congestion and also help prevent the chaos on the road, especially during the peak tourist season.
 
 Despite repeated efforts TOI was unable to contact Candolim sarpanch   for his comments the issue.
