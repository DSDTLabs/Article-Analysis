MUMBAI: A union of   cooperatives evoked confusion by announcing an immediate Rs-3 increase in milk prices without informing or consulting individual companies on Wednesday. 

 Prakash Nayakal, who heads a milk dealers’ union, said, “Another rider is that of the Rs-3 hike, consumers must pay Rs 2, while companies and distributors shall foot the remainder of Re 1. How will this work?”
 
 If dealers refuse, consumers could be charged varying amounts for the same product and brand unless the hike is endorsed or revoked.
 
 The   or milk farmers’ union is based in Islampur, Sangli. Its president  , owner of the Krushna brand, who announced the controversial decision, said, “I have hiked the rates of my brand. Other firms will follow suit by next week.”
 
 An advertisement issued by the union says cow’s milk will cost Rs 42 per litre and buffalo milk Rs 54. Curiously, it has urged customers to pay the new price though milk packs will continue to carry the old rates for the time being. This is a violation of MRP laws and can invite punitive action by the legal metrology department. Patil said, “It will take 10-15 days to print the new packs, so we went ahead with the announcement.”
 
 Uncertainty prevailed throughout Wednesday. An official from   said they had hiked rates by Rs 2 as recently as January 1. “Now, we may have to raise prices again at our board meeting on Thursday,” he said. “We were not informed or consulted about the Samiti’s proposal.” He agreed that unless pack labels were revised, new prices cannot be levied under MRP regulations.
 
 Consumers already continue to pay Rs 2 over MRP on several brands despite a long-drawn campaign by the legal metrology department to enforce the law.
