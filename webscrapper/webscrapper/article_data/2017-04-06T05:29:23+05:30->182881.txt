The survey conducted by  , a community social media platform, reveals that nearly 57% of parents in Karnataka say that schools have increased fees by more than 10% for next academic year.

 The survey covered 1,594 parents who said they felt school fees had been rising at much higher rates than their average earnings. The survey covered parents from CBSE, ICSE and state board schools across the state.
 
 About 43% of respondents said their school had hiked fees by about 10%, while 7% said the fee hike was as much as 20%. The survey was conducted in 16 other states as well.
 
 “My son’s school sent a note few days ago which said that owing to maintenance and other expenses, the fees this year would be 15% more than last year,” said Sunayana Motwani (name changed) whose son studies in an ICSE school. “The hike is not the same every year. Last year, the school raised fees by 10%. It does seem a little unreasonable,” she said.
 
 Charan Padam, a parent at a CBSE school in north Bengaluru, said the school had also increased the transportation fees by 15%. “When we asked the school authorities, they said expenses had gone up,” he said.
 
 A spokesperson from LocalCircles said, “Legislation is being introduced across the country to regulate fees but it varies from state to state. We want to send our findings to the HRD ministry and state education departments.”
 
 The Central Board of Secondary Education had made it mandatory for schools to disclose their fee structures from last year. “The board cannot regulate fees specifically, instead it can only aim for transparency in disclosure. We have written to CBSE as well to scrutinize these fee hikes in CBSE schools,” the official said.
