HYDERABAD: Nizamabad MP Kavitha Kalvakuntla on Thursday expressed support for "Andhra brothers" of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and YSR   demanding special status for Andhra Pradesh. "In fact, all the promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act for both AP and Telangana should be fulfilled. Governance is a continuous process irrespective of which party is in power," the TRS MP said during her speech on the budget in the  . 

 Raising some of the needs of Telangana, Kavitha made a plea for sops to be given to farmers. "Take care of the needs of farmers. You will be benefited by this even during the elections," she told finance minister  . Kavitha said a plea was pending with the Centre to accord national status for the massive Kaleshwaram project in the state. "At least provide financial assistance," she said. 
 
 Kavitha said the ease of doing business has placed India a notch higher and this was because of measures taken by the Centre, including introduction of GST and demonetisation. "Only if there is a specific strategy in place can farmers benefit. You have to take interest," she said. Kavitha said some bills had been pending for a long time, including the Pesticides Bill, Nabard Bill and Cold Storage Bill. 
 
 "The TRS has supported the government on GST and demonetisation. That was what you came up with. When we are asking more sops for farmers, you should oblige us," she told the government. Kavitha said fertilizer subsidy should go directly to farmers instead of companies. She also wondered why import of fertilizers was from only three companies. Because of this, there was also delay in procuring fertilizers, she said. She urged the Union government to include 24 crops to be purchased under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme.
 
 The TRS MP asked for timely subsidy for micro irrigation. She pointed out that the subsidy was reaching them after one-and-half to two years.
