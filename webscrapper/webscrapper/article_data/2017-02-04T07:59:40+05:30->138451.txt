JAIPUR: A 2,000-strong mob of arsonists razed homes of 42   of the traditionally   on August 19, 2014 at Dhikola in  . The attack occurred at a time when many from the community were away on pilgrimage. Chief minister   later met the Banjaras and assured them of pattas (titles) to the land. However, the government later said the land was under dispute and hence pattas could not be granted. To the astonishment of social activists, government has now appealed that this matter be withdrawn from court “in public interest”.

 Paras Banjara, first graduate from this community who has been aiding members of his community in pursuing this matter in court told TOI, “It is as if the government is sensitive to the interests of arsonists. What happens to the interests of poor victims?”
 
 On January 27, public prosecutor Shahpura of   district wrote to the upper sessions court seeking that FIR 222/14, registered under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) 149 (unlawful assembly guilty of offence) 395 (punishment for dacoity), 452 (trespass), 354 (assault or criminal force on woman), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance), be withdrawn. 
 
 The prosecutor will have to present himself in court now and seek that the FIR be withdrawn. The matter will be heard in the sessions court on February 10.
 
 Mukesh Nirvasit of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sanghatan said, “The traditionally nomadic Banjaras have been on the margins of society for centuries, over generations. The government too is making victims of them now instead of coming to their aid. This exposes the feudal character of the state government, which must ensure justice. Otherwise, what point is having a government at all?”
