KOLKATA: Bengal gets another healthcare facility in the form of a heart rhythm care center. Launched by  , Howrah the center will focus exclusively on the diagnosis and treatment of all types of abnormalities in heart rhythm and irregularities in the electrical circuit of the heart causing heart rhythm disturbance.

 Heart rhythm disorder or   is an abnormality in the timing or pattern of the heartbeat. Arrhythmia may cause the heart to beat too rapidly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart rhythm disorders are common and may cause a wide variety of symptoms, such as a racing, skipping or fluttering sensation (called palpitations) in the chest. This mostly happens due to the electrical disorder in the heart.
 
  “The main mode of diagnosis and treatment in centre for heart rhythm care is interventional electrophysiology, which includes electrophysiology study and radio-frequency ablation for common arrhythmias. Radio-frequency ablation is a minimally invasive procedure done in the cath-lab. There would be ablation for complex arrhythmias using 3-D mapping system as well.” said Dr Kapil Kumawat, senior consultant cardiologist and electrophysiologist, Narayana Health City, Bengaluru.
 Disorders due to electrical systems of the heart are diagnosed or treated appropriately. In fact about half the deaths related to   is due to a condition called ventricular fibrillation, an electrical (heart rhythm) disorder.
 
 “In most cases people come to know that they have arrhythmia only when the problem becomes extremely serious. Hence it is very important to create awareness about arrhythmia as patients can be saved if they are alert of the symptoms, solutions and are treated immediately.” said Dr Munna Das, consultant interventional cardiologist and electrophysiologist at Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, Howrah.
 
 The services at the Howrah facility can be availed for inpatients everyday, while outpatient services will be functional on every Thursday.
