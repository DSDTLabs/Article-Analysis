BENGALURU: Encouraged by its foolproof arrangements for the SSLC and PU exams last year, the education department has decided to scale up security for the  . Surveillance cameras will be installed at all exam centres and not just be restricted to treasuries where question papers and answerscripts are stored.

 However, it’s not yet clear whether cameras will be installed in the examination halls.
 
 After Chemistry question papers were leaked in 2016, the   put in place the Karnataka Secure Examination System ( ) last year to curb malpractices during exams. The department installed cameras in treasury offices. While PU exams are being held at 900 centres across the state this year, SSLC exams will conducted at more than 2,000 centres.
 
 “All other features of the KSES, like biometric authorizations and barcode scanning of papers in all district head offices, will continue. Last year, we were unable to install surveillance cameras at the centres and restricted them to treasury offices. However, this year we have made sure that every centre is equipped with surveillance cameras,” said C  , director, department of pre-university education.
 
 The system ensures four levels of security – surveillance, alert systems to signal police about any untoward movement, barcoding of each package of question papers and biometric access to treasury offices. Officials have already been pre-registered for the biometric process. Five students and an invigilator will have to sign the envelope to prove the package of question papers was brought in safely and is untampered.
 
 “We have also decided to increase surveillance in sub-treasury offices instead of just district treasuries. This will increase security in remote areas as well in places where papers will be stored,” said V Sumangala, director, Karnataka Secondary Education and Examinations Board. The sub-treasuries will open an hour prior to the other treasuries on exam days.
