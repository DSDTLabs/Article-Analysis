PATNA: Invigilators and evaluators are disappointed with the Bihar School Examination   ( ) because of non-payment of remuneration to them. Those, who were on examination duty and who had evaluated the answer sheets of classes X and XII exams last year, have allegedly not been paid for their service.

 Mathematics teacher  , who claims to have evaluated over 400 answer sheets, didn’t receive a single penny. “I request the Board to clear the payment before the commencement of the 2018 examinations. Such negligence on the part of the Board is unacceptable,” he said.
 
 There were three centres for the evaluation of Matriculation answer books in Bettiah. According to Bihar Secondary School Teachers’ Association (BSSTA) member  , “Of the three, teachers at two centres were paid the remuneration. However, at least 200 evaluators at the S S Girls’ High School centre did not receive any money. The BSEB accounts department had assured us that payment of the remaining Rs 4.8 lakh would be made by December 17, but nothing happened.”
 
 BSSTA general secretary Shatrughan Prasad Singh urged the Board to give conveyance allowance to the invigilators. He said, “Teachers, sent to examination centres 15-20km away from their schools, were promised to be given only Rs 50 each for three hours. I know some evaluators who have not even been paid for evaluating copies during the last two years.”
 
 According to Shobha Upadhyay, a teacher, she and her colleagues had spent hours in correcting the answer sheets at the evaluation centres. “What did we get in return of our hard work,” she asked. 
 
 The Board, on the other hand, claimed that the payment would be made soon.
