 When you have a grand, royal wedding as the backdrop of a film, it opens up a huge avenue to experiment with music. And that’s what the composers of 'Laali Ki Shaadi Mein Laddoo Deewana' have done. This seven-song album is replete with romantic and fun shaadi numbers. The first one, 'Laali Ki Shaadi', is the title track, composed by Revant & Siddharth. Sung by the energetic  , it begins on a promising note. It complements the mood of the film, which isn’t surprising because the lyrics have been penned by its director,  . The track has Punjabi influences, and with a catchy hookline, it should have been a sureshot winner. But beyond a point, it sounds repetitive. The next song — Vipin Patwa’s 'Bezubaan' — lifts our spirits. KK is at his best in this breezy romantic track, and the full-blown guitar sound adds life to the song. 'Rishta' is an intensely romantic track and   opens it with a mesmerising keys prelude. He also goes behind the mic with  , who has now become the poster boy for all things passionate. Vipin’s 'Rog Jaane' has two versions. While Palak Muchhal is a common element, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and   give her company in each of the songs. This subtle duet stands out till the mukhda and also uses a lot of traditional instruments, but sadly, loses sheen post that. 'Mano Ya Na Mano', composed by Revant & Siddharth and sung by Malini Awasthi, is along the lines of 'Main Sasural Nahi Jaaungi' ('Chandni'), but is nothing great to write home about. The last track, 'Naino Ke Pokhar', is a pathos number. Sung by Mohd Irffan and Vipin, who has also composed the track, this one is a pleasing listen, with flute and strings leading the way. The highlight of the album is the variety it offers, both in terms of genre and orchestration. But sadly, not all have recall value.
