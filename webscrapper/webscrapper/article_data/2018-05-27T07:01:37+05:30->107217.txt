PANAJI: The state government has banned   and cutting of roads during the monsoon till July 13 to ensure the safety of motorists and pedestrians, as also to ensure the smooth flow of traffic. 

 Any organization or individual found digging national and state highways will be punished under Section 188 of the IPC, district magistrate of North Goa, Nila  , said in an order.
 
 “It is expedient to put a ban on digging and cutting of all types of roads, including national highways, state highways, major district roads, road-shoulders, lanes and thoroughfares during the monsoons as these activities pose imminent danger and disruption to the life of motorists, pedestrians and general public,” Mohanan said.
