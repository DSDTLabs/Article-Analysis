SINGAPORE: Japan's Defense Minister   said on Saturday it was important not to reward   for only agreeing to dialogue and it must take concrete action to dismantle all of its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

 
 Speaking at the Shangri-la Dialogue security forum in Singapore, Onodera said North Korea had entered into agreements to end its nuclear programme in the past only to conduct more activities to further their weapons development.
 
 North Korea's leader   is set to meet US President   in Singapore for an unprecedented summit on June 12.
