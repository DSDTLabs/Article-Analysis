HYDERABAD: Haseena Begum, 45, of Sanathnagar, who suffered fractures in her legs and back after being pushed from the third floor by her employer (kafil) in Damam, Saudi Arabi, is in for another shock. The kafil has reportedly given a 48-hour deadline to her to withdraw her police complaint against him.

 The man has threatened her that if she doesn’t fall in line, he will file a counter-complaint against her for theft, which could result in her being jailed there. The victim’s son sought external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj’s help to rescue his mother.
 
 In her complaint, Haseena Begum alleged that her employer Saman Sami Khalifa had assaulted her. She was hospitalised after the attack, following which she was taken to the police station. Angry over Haseena going to police, Khalifa allegedly barged into the police station and beat her up again.
 
 Haseena’s son  , who lives in Hyderabad, said he received a call around 1 pm on Wednesday from someone associated with the   in Riyadh, asking him to give a newspaper statement that Haseena had accidentally fallen from the building and no one had pushed her. “A person by the name Omni called and gave me a 48-hour deadline on behalf of Khalifa. If my mother and I do not retract and give him a clean chit, he threatened that she would land in jail,” Wajid said.
 
 Seeking Sushma Swaraj’s intervention in the case after the deadline threat, Wajid said, “My mother needs to be rescued. She is still stuck inside the police station in Saudi Arabia.” The assault on Haseena was first reported by TOI on March 16, after which Swaraj had reacted to her plight. The Indian Embassy reached out to her, and the chief secretary of Telangana also wrote a letter to the Centre seeking help in rescuing her.
 
 Khalifa has been blacklisted by the Indian Embassy, making it impossible for him to make new recruitments from India in future.
