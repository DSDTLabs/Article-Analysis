The trailer of Rahul Dholakia’s upcoming ' ' is already a hit with cine-lovers. Along with   Khan’s menacing avatar as the eponymous character, Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s outing as ACP   has also created a stir. The intense and effortless chemistry that the two actors share is being appreciated. According to Nawaz, it’s all because of their sensibilities. Says he, “Whenever I did a scene with Shah Rukh bhai, I would hope that it would go on and on. I wanted as many retakes as possible. The idea was to extract every bit of the scene’s essence. And it was not about the text or the dialogues. Both Shah Rukh and I wanted to keep working on the subtext of the scene, to exploit it to the fullest. So, I can say that you will get to see great chemistry between us in 'Raees'.” 

 A new promo, which will be out today, is all set to give you another glimpse of Nawaz’s hard-hitting performance. The film will hit the screens on January 25.
