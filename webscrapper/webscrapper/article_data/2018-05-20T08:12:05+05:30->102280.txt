MANGALURU: After the election, the   (Marxist) and   are now busy giving the final touches to the houses being constructed for eight   families who lost their homes when   acquired their land. 

 Though their land near   Circle in the city was acquired, the Koraga families did not get compensation as they did not have property documents and the Left party and the Samiti came to lend a helping hand. 
 
 The tribal community was living in dwellings on government land near Nanthoor and the land was acquired for widening the Kochi - Panvel national highway. The keys of the new houses will be handed over to the families on Sunday.
 
 Samiti convner Krishnappa Konchady told TOI, "Though the families were living in the land, they were not given fair compensation and rehabilitation during land acquisition seven years ago. All the families are socially and economically weak and did not have any support. Hence, we formed a house construction committee and constructed eight houses at a cost of Rs 6.5 lakh each at Kotimura near Kulshekhar in the city."
 
 While the   (ITDP) sanctioned Rs 2 lakh each, the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) sanctioned Rs 1 lakh each for the project, he said. 
 
 "Though the families received support from ITDP and MCC, it was not sufficient to build the houses, Hence, the Samiti pooled money to complete the project," said Konchady.
 
 CPI(M) leader Muneer Katipalla said the new homes are a result of the fights and efforts being carried out by the party and its affiliated organizations in assisting tribal families. "We raised our voice and held protests when the families were vacated from their dwellings. As a result, the district administration shifted the families to rented houses and offered to provide rehabilitation. However, official apathy delayed the rehabilitation and the sanctions from the government were insufficient too. Hence, the Samiti along with party workers pooled money from well-wishers," he said.
