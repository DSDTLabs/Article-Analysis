MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) budget for 2018-19, to be presented on Friday, is unlikely to spring any surprises, said civic sources. They expect allocation for   and stormwater drain departments to witness a marginal rise. 

 This is municipal chief Ajoy Mehta’s third budget since he took charge in April 2015; it could also be his last one. 
 
 Citizens and activists hope the BMC allocates funds judiciously and utilizes them completely, especially for crucial departments like roads. “We expect BMC to propose new technologies for road repairs so that they last longer. Currently, the lifespan of most roads in the city is a few years,” said activist GR Vora said.
 
 BMC is the richest civic body in the country. It’s budget size in 2017-18 was Rs 25,141 crore—it had witnessed a drop of almost Rs 10,000 crore as the 2016-17 budget was Rs 37,052 crore.
 
 In the current fiscal year, BMC’s earnings have taken a major hit from almost revenue-generating sources. On January 30, TOI had reported on how the BMC is struggling to meet its target for   this fiscal. Now, it seems the Development Plan ( ) department may not meet its target too.
 
 Owing to the slack in the real estate market, coupled with the high court ban on construction on vacant plots, BMC has earned Rs 3,112 crore so far from the DP department. The target for in 2017-18 is Rs 4,964 crore. A senior civic official said, “The DP department earns revenue through building permissions issued, premiums, penalties or FSI. With the revenue being at an all-time low this year, we have now revised the target to Rs 3,576 crore.” In fact, going by available data, revenue from DP department seems to be heading south—in 2014-15, it was Rs 5,171 crore, in 2015-16, Rs 4,977 crore and in 2016-17, Rs 4,339 crore.
 
 Till last week, property tax collected in 2017-18 was Rs 3,320 crore—the target is Rs 5,200 crore. Last fiscal, till January, the BMC had earned around Rs 3,380 crore from property tax.
