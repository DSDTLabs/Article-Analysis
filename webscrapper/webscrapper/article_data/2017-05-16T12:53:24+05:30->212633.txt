THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The employees of   centres here have raised concerns over the plan to increase private sector participation in Isro's initiatives. 

 "Increased private participation for production of key space components is speculated as a move towards total privatization in future," said Isro staff association president G Ramesh.
 
 Already the production of many components for space launch vehicles and satellites is outsourced by Isro centres to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Godrej, Larsen & Toubro and other firms. Shortage of manpower and resources for production at Isro centres are the reasons behind outsourcing production, yet certain launch vehicle components and solid propellants are produced at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC). Liquid propellants are produced at Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre ( ) and   (IPRC). These centres are also involved in testing, assembling and integrating the space components for launch missions.
 
 "In future, through privatization it is feared that ISRO centres will be denied even the control over launch missions," said G R  , general secretary of Isro staff association.
 
 ISRO staff association with over 1,400 members include technical and administrative staff of VSSC, LPSC, IPRC and other centres. "We have sought help from the department of space and Isro authorities to fill up the staff vacancies in various cadres and to seek for regularization of contract workers to ensure that Isro centres do not suffer because of staff crunch. We had also asked to restore the Launch Campaign Allowance and Space Technology Allowance which were removed as per recommendations of the seventh pay commission," Pramod said.
