GHAZIABAD: Schools in Ghaziabad will remain closed for classes from nursery to VIII till January 11, after the district magistrate issued an order on Sunday to shut classes due to the extreme cold conditions prevalent in the district.

 “Since there has been no abatement in the cold weather conditions in the district, schools have been asked to remain closed till January 11. Closure orders had been earlier issued till January 8. This is an extension of the order,” district magistrate  , told TOI.
 
 The district administration had issued an order on December 29 to all schools in Ghaziabad to remain shut for five days from December 30 till January 3. On January 3, the administration further extended the closure order till January 8.
 
 The association of school owners in Ghaziabad said information will be sent over to ensure compliance of the order. “However, with exams approaching, it will be very difficult for teachers to complete syllabus in time after schools re-open. Students will also be left with very less time for preparation for examinations,” said  , president,   (Ghaziabad).
 
 Residents in Indirapuram said that they were yet to receive information regarding closure orders from schools till late Sunday evening.
 
 “For kids studying in lower classes, it is indeed difficult to get ready for classes early in the morning. As an alternative, maybe school hours could be altered so that syllabus of students in upper classes gets completed in time,” said  , founder, Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association of Ghaziabad.
