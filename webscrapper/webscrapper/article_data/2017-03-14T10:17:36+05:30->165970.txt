HYDERABAD: For the second consecutive year, the Telangana government has not allocated any budget for the two-bed room housing project. Instead, it said that the cost of construction would be met through extra-budgetary resources. 

 The state government had sanctioned 2.60 lakh two bed room houses (2BHK) as part of its programme to provide housing for the poor. Of these, 1,426 houses were completed by February 28 this year and 16,068 houses have been taken up for construction. Around 20,000 houses are being proposed in Greater Hyderabad. Tender process has been initiated by the GHMC. 
 
 Since contractors were not showing any interest in taking up 2BHK housing project, especially due to the low unit cost, municipal minister KT Rama Rao recently held a meeting with builders and contractors to encourage them to take up the project as part of their social responsibility. The housing department also held a meeting with cement companies and signed a memorandum of understanding for supply of cement at the rate of 230 per bag. 
 
 The government also announced that it would supply sand free of cost. While the programme was beset with problems related to availability of suitable land parcels in the city, it decided to take some railway land at places like Chilkalguda and provide alternate land to railways. Finance minister Eatela Rajender said that district collectors have identified land for the housing scheme.
