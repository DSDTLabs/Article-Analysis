MUMBAI: Two managers of a restopub 1Above, arrested in connection with the fire at   on December 29 which claimed 14 lives, applied for bail on Wednesday pleading they had risked their own lives to rescue guests and had no role to play in any violation of rules. 

 The fire on December 29, 2017 had gutted two adjoining rooftop restobars—1Above and Mojo Bistro. On December 31, 1Above managers,   and Lisbon  , were arrested and sent to judicial custody till January 22. Now, in two separate pleas, they contended they were being “falsely implicated only because the owners, partners of   could not be traced by the prosecution.” 
 
 Lopes, in his bail plea filed through advocate  , said without any regard for their own safety, they had rescued 150 to 175 people. Lopes, who is on probation as assistant restaurant manager, said he had stepped out to take an urgent call on his cellphone when the fire broke out and he was asked by the owners to help evacuate customers. “The fire had spread so fast’’ that they got no time to figure out what rescue methods to employ, he said, adding “it may not have been possible to rescue the 14 in the toilet as they could not be traced due to the fire.’’ 
 
 Their plea is, at best, they can be prosecution witnesses and, in any case, are not concerned with any alteration or erection of the structure. Their duty was to serve food and beverages and they cannot be booked for culpable homicide. The men said they should be charged under a bailable section pertaining to negligence and be granted bail. 
 
 A magistrate will hear their bail pleas on Thursday.
