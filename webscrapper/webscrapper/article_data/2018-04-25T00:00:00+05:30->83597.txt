This week’s release,  , sees   play a politician with shades of grey. A remake of the Tamil film  , Priya says that although they have stuck to the original, she has given her own touch to the role essayed by   in Kodi. Ahead of the release, Priya spoke to us about the film, working in remakes and why her personal life is no one else’s business…

 
 
 Yes, I most definitely am, because you get to play something out of the ordinary. In such roles, you can smile about having a devious plan or at something sinister that you have done. You can’t do this when you are the hero’s love interest. But when you are playing that mixed with shades of grey, it gives you an extra kick.
 
 
 
 No. I have been part of a couple of remakes in the past. The only difference here is that I got to play one of the main characters with a negative side to her. I am excited about this role.
 
 
 
 I have seen the original and Trisha has done a phenomenal job. I wanted to bring in my own touch to the character and I hope that I have managed to do that. I hope that audiences will see a difference in the role.
 
 
 
 I just take it in through one ear and out through the other. It’s not nice when people attack you at a personal level. If you don’t want to be part of a star’s celebration, you have no right to troll them. Why troll only South stars and not those up North? Bollywood also has many inter-religious marriages that are accepted and welcomed with open arms. People take it personally in the South. I am answerable only to my parents, Mustufa, and his parents, and no one else. I will do what I feel like and when I feel like it. I am born Hindu and Mustufa is Muslim. People assume that I will convert to Islam. But this is not so; the Special Marriage Act takes care of that. We respect each other’s customs, but I am not going to change my religion, and I had discussed this with Mustufa and his parents long ago. And his parents were more than OK with it.
