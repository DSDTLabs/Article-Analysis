Vijayawada: The Andhra Pradesh State FiberNet Limited’s (APSFL) ambitious plan to set up a high-speed information highway - AP Fibergrid - the has hit a logjam, thanks to some unidentified miscreants and robbers who are allegedly stealing the cables that are being laid for the project. 

 The police nabbed a gang recently on charges of stealing a 65-km-long optical fiber cable, packed in 13 bundles, at Challapalli in Krishna district. 
 
 The cable was brought for the state government’s Fibergrid project to provide every household with high-speed Internet, television and telephone services at 149 per month. Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu took cognisance of the issue, asking the district superintendents of police at the collector’s conference, to take stern action against the miscreants. 
 
 “Even if the officials of lower ranks are found involved in the theft of cables, suspend them and take action. We don’t want anyone to steal the government property,” the chief minister told district superintendents of police and heads of other police units in the state. 
 
 The chief minister has given a free hand to the police to arrest the miscreants who, he termed, ‘anti-nationals’. Krishna district SP Sarva Sreshta Tripathi told TOI about a few incidents that took place six months ago in Jaggaiahpet and Nandigama regions. 
 
 “We have detected a few cases of cable theft in Jaggaiahpet and Nandigama. We arrested and took action against them in two days. After that, we did not receive any complaints,” Tripathi said.
 
 According to the police, the theft of optical fiber cables, put up on electric poles, have also been rampant in other districts.
 
 Sources said that local cable TV operators are trying to derail the project. The project, inaugurated by President Ramnath Kovind on December 27, is being implemented by APSFL across the state. Works are nearing completion in West Godavari and Krishna districts.
