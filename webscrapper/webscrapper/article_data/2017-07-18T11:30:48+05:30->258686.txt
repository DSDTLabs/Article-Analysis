BHUBANESWAR : The   and   (BMC) continue to lock horns over   in city. 

 Sources said the issue is yet to be resolved with NHAI saying that it is not mandated to construct drains along the national highway to direct rain water. The NHAI had made it clear in a meeting with the BMC officials on Sunday that it will construct culverts and not drains. 
 
  "We have agreed to take a temporary measure by diverting the   towards the culvert that we will construct after a fresh study of the places where frequent complaints of waterlogging is coming from. Within a month, we will have another meeting with the BMC and state government officials regarding the issue," said NHAI regional officer D Sarangi. 
 
 The BMC has, however, maintained that NHAI has overlooked its repeated requests to look into the faulty road engineering allegedly leading to waterlogging in the city. The BMC commissioner, Krishan Kumar, had written to the NHAI identifying five places on the NH-16, where waterlogging has been reported. 
 
 "We had urged the NHAI to construct drains and take corrective measures to avoid stagnation of water on the service road of the NH. We will take the matter to the level of chief secretary for further deliberation," said an officer of BMC. 
 
 The civic body said NHAI's letter to the contract agency revealed the faulty road engineering. The NHAI has pulled up the contract agency which took up the NH-16 work.
