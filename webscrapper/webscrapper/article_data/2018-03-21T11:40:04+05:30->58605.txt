CHENNAI:   appointed Spaniard   as coach Akbar’s assistant and director of youth development for the side. As first reported by TOI, Vila had worked as Barcelona and Manchester City’s technical scout and has spotted talents like Mauro Icardi of Inter Milan and   of Sevilla.

 
 Till last year, he had worked closely with   at City and helped him in writing technical reports about players like Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling. Vila has also worked with coach Akbar at Global Cebu. “I always like to take up challenges. So this role provided me with an opportunity to make a difference. That’s why I chose Chennai City and came here,” Vila told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 The first task of Akbar and Vila will be to find a replacement for their star midfielder M Soosairaj, who was sold to ISL outfit Jamshedpur FC towards the end of their domestic season. Akbar said that local players like Alexander Romario, Rajapandi and Pandian can step up to the role.
 
 “Letting Soosairaj go was a big blow. I wasn’t aware initially and thought of developing our squad around him. But such things happen in football. We will be revamping our squad. Our owner Rohit Ramesh wants to provide a platform for local talents through his team. I’m on the same page with his philosophy and will try to polish the skills of Pandian, Romario and others. We are also trying to rope in a European forward this season,” Akbar said.
