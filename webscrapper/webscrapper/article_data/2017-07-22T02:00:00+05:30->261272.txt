GAYA: With nearly 500 cases being dealt by the legal cell of  , the university has virtually turned into a litigants paradise. More than three fourth of the pending cases are in the nature of writ applications filed with the  , nearly 100 contempt proceedings have also been initiated against the university officials including the VC and the registrar.

 Almost all the cases have been filed by the serving and retired employees of the university of both teaching and the non-teaching category. The contempt proceedings are the result of non-compliance of court orders in service matters.
 
 On account of a large number of cases, senior officials remain pre-occupied with litigation including framing of ‘statement of facts’ and holding meeting with the university’s lawyers. Many a time the court seeks physical presence of the VC or the registrar.
 
 Conceding that high incidence of litigation was a serious problem and it affected the university's academic development agenda, VC Prof Qamar Ahsan said he has constituted a   under his chairmanship and the committee would meet once a month to address the genuine grievances of the employees and try to evade litigation.
 
 As per the university scheme of things, aggrieved employees will have to submit their grievances before the proctor before 15th of every month. The proctor, in turn, would present the grievances in a file form before the committee which would meet on the 25th of every month.
 
 “The first meet of the   committee would be held on July 25, 2017. Besides, the VC, who is the ex officio chairman of the committee, the pro-VC, registrar, financial advisor and finance officer are the members of the committee,” said the VC. 
 
 The Grievance Redressal committee has so far received 45 petitions for consideration and redressal at its first meet. The VC hoped that the new mechanism would help to bring down litigation.
