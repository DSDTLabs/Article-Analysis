MUMBAI: A Malwani resident,   (29), was arrested for allegedly murdering a fellow tution teacher living in the same locality after the latter’s wife slapped him. The deceased,   (45), and Harijan reportedly had a professional rivalry.

 According to the police, the two men conducted tuitions next to each other and charged them Rs 100 to Rs 200 per student. “Both the men thought that the other was poaching students and hence, they did not get along,” said a police officer.
 
 On Thursday, Harijan’s neighbour, a 17-year-old girl, complained to her sister that he had touched her inappropriately the night before. The sister then went to Biswas’s house and sought help from his wife, Jaya. 
 
 “Jaya and the girl’s sister went to Harijan’s house on Thursday evening and confronted him about the molestation. After a heated exchange of words, Jaya reportedly slapped Harijan a couple of times,” an officer said. 
 
 Later around 8.30pm, a furious Harijan went to Biswas’s house and started hurling abuses. After an argument, Harijan pulled out a knife and stabbed Biswas repeatedly in his stomach, chest and head. Neighbours rushed Biswas to a hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.
 
 “Harijan stabbed Biswas four times outside his house at Ambhujwadi and fled the spot. We tracked him down from the nearby forests the same night,” said senior inspector  . 
 
 “We have registered a case against Harijan under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code,” said Phatangare. He added that the teen had not pressed any charges against Harijan.
