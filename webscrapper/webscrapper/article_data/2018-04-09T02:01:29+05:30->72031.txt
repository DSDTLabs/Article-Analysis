THANE: Incidents of fire, followed by the rising number of   dominated the disaster chart in the lake city from April 2017-March 2018, as per the annual report compiled by the regional disaster management cell here. 

 Cases of fire outbreak, possibly due to   leaks or due to short circuits topped the chart of life-threatening incidents during the last 12 months. Officials said March saw the highest number of fires as 110 incidents were reported as against 78 cases of fire reported during February. 
 
 The disaster chart also reveals the green cover in the lake city is under serious threat, as 617 incidents of tree falls have been reported during the last one year. The environmentalist camp here blamed the civic body for the growing incidents of tree falls as the indiscriminate chopping away of branches and the concretization has resulted in old trees crashing down. 
 
 A total of 4,400 disaster incidents, including building crashes, pipeline bursts, wall collapses among others were recorded during 2017-18. “This shows the authority is lacking in terms of routine maintenance work of pipelines. Even though the team arrives quickly at the spot, thousands of litres of water get wasted and the damage has already been caused,” a civic official said.
