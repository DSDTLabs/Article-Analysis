RAMANATHAPURAM: A 59-year-old man was arrested on Monday for growing four ganja plants on a piece of poromboke land at   near   in Ramanathapuram district.

 The accused has been identified as I Nagu. Based on a tip off, a special police team inspected his land and found four ganja plants there. The plants were destroyed.
 
 Investigations revealed that he had procured the seeds from   district. Police said Nagu was a ganja addict and an alcoholic. He grew the plants for his own use. However, a detailed inquiry was underway to find out whether he had sold ganja to anyone.
 
 The Abiramam police registered a case.
 
 Police said that Nagu landed in jail following a secret information received by the organised crime unit ( ) led by inspector Rajesh. Apart from the team, local police teams led by the deputy superintendent of police Shanmugasundaram and Kamuthi police inspector Sakkarapani along with Abiramam police too went to the spot.
 
 Shanmugasundaram said the plants were raised hardly 50 feet from the main road. However, it was not noticed by anyone so far as it was surrounded by juliflora trees. Growing of ganja plant is an offence even if it is a single plant, he said. 
 
 A police officer from Madurai said that with the source for ganja in Theni district having dried up, people are dependent on other sources. Often, ganja is procured from various regions in Andhra Pradesh and brought to Madurai and other southern districts through various modes of transport.
