AGRA: The strike by resident doctors of   entered the seventh day on Wednesday, affecting healthcare services in the hospital and patients suffering due to want of medical attention. Despite threats by the district administration to invoke Essential Services Maintenance Act ( ) and   warning of strict action against the striking doctors, the resident doctors refused to budge.
 
  The protesting doctors said they would call off their strike only if their demand for suspension of AMU cabinet member Zaid Shervani, who had allegedly manhandled a woman doctor last week, was met. Patients continue to have a harrowing time in the ongoing tussle between AMU students' union and the resident doctors' association (RDA).
  
  Talking to TOI, RDA president Dr Abdullah Azmi said that their strike would continue until their demand for suspension of Zaid Shervani from the cabinet post, as well as from the university, are not fulfilled. 
  
  Shafey Kidwai, member in charge of the public relation office of AMU, said that the strike by resident doctors was declared “illegal” and that strict action would be taken against them if they failed to resume their duties by tomorrow (Thursday).
  
  Meanwhile, AMU students union president Mashkoor Ahmad Usmani said that talks are on and that, probably, the strike might be called off tonight (Wednesday night).
  
  An enquiry committee, comprising Dr   (department of obstetrics and gynaecology), Dr Naseem Ahmad Khan (department of chemical engineering) and Dr Naiyer Asif (department of orthopaedic surgery), was earlier re-constituted to investigate the incident of altercation between a junior resident doctor and an AMUSU cabinet member. However, the committee is yet to submit the report.
