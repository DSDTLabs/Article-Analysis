  , who became the first player from Goa to attain the India No. 1 rank in both singles and doubles, was pleased as punch after being selected for the India squad which will take part in the Thomas & Uber Cup later this month in Bangkok.
 
  The 19-year-old Goan, who is currently home to sort out passport issues, is waiting for formal communication from the   Association of India (BAI), although the association has already made the announcement.
  
  Apart from Anura, the Uber Cup squad comprises of 2018 CWG gold medallist Saina Nehwal, rising shuttlers Vaishnavi Jakka Reddy (World No. 64/Junior World No. 5), Sai Krishna Priya (World No. 66) and India No. 2 Vaishnavi Bhale.
  
  “I am feeling great to be part of the India team where Saina and other big stars will be present. It will be a learning experience for me. I will try my best, if I get a chance to play,” said Anura.
  
  Anura, who holds India No. 1 ranking in singles and No. 2 in doubles, won the singles title at the All India Senior Ranking tournament held at Dehradun early this year.
  
  The women’s team, which won bronze at the last edition, take on Canada in the first tie, followed by Australia and Japan.
  
  “While selecting the squad, we have considered the performance of the players at the domestic level and those who have excelled in the national circuit have been given the opportunity to show their talent at the highest level,” BAI Himanta Biswa Sarma was quoted as saying by PTI.
  
  In the men’s section, World No. 8 HS Prannoy will lead India’s charge along with World No.18 B Sai Praneeth, young Sameer Verma and Junior World No.4 Lakshay Sen.
