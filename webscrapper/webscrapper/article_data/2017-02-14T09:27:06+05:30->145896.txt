NEW DELHI: Navjivan Vihar, a small, affluent area near Malviya Nagar in  , will become the first   in the city to get   24x7.

 DJB has identified the colony as a district metering area (DMA) under which it has been monitoring supply, leakages, consumption, etc. By February-end or the beginning of March, DJB has assured high-quality water supply, which won’t require to be filtered further. Last year, CM Arvind Kejriwal had assured supply of water, which could be consumed directly from the tap across the city by 2017. Sources, however, said that while the government would extend piped supply to all colonies by the year-end, supply of potable water would take at least 5-6 years.
 
 “The colony has more than 1,000 consumers. We had to isolate the colony hydraulically and compute real losses. First, we put in a leak detection mechanism and then check for losses at individual house level. The problem with the colony because it is home to affluent people is that many did not bother about small leakages,” said a senior DJB official. “We are in touch with a few households, trying to convince them to plug leakages at their end to ensure 24x7 water to the colony.”
 
 The other factor that officials said would ensure contamination-free water was adequate pressure in supply pipes. “Intermittent supply of water is another factor behind contamination. By that argument, 24x7 supply with a maintained pressure would guarantee a reasonably good quality of water. This pressure can be maintained only if there are no leakages,” said the official.
 
 Navjivan Vihar is part of the Malviya Nagar public-private partnership water project, one of three taken up in Delhi, under which French company Degremont is to supply 24x7 water to colonies. At present, it is receiving water twice a day for about 2-3 hours each time. According to officials, once the Navjivan Vihar project is implemented, 33 more DMAs will be set up in different locations.
