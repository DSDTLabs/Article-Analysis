HYDERABAD:   employees will get extra one month's   as a reward for completing the land records purification programme on a war-footing. Chief minister   announced on Saturday that this amount should be given to employees to acknowledge their hard work and encourage them. As many as 10,809 revenue employees, 24,410 village revenue assistants( ) and 530 employees from survey wing will be benefitted.

 
 The CM said that all these 35,749 employees had completed the task assigned to them in 100 days with commitment and dedication, taking up something that has not undertaken anywhere in the country before. He said the land records purification was taken up for the first time in 80 days. The employees undertook the task of getting clarity on the ownership of land.
 
 
 During the process, some clarity was also got on the status of assigned lands. Out of the 22.5 lakh acres of land given to landless poor, there is now clarity about 20 lakh acres. The authorities are trying to get more clarity on who holds the two and ahalf lakh acres. Except for ownership of land under litigation between revenue and forest department, and also in court cases, there is almost good clarity on the ownership of the land in the state.
 
 
 The chief minister said only because additional districts were created, it was possible to get all the work done pertaining to land records purification.
