 Scientists from IFGTB, who were part of the   (FoSA), conducted a symbolic demonstration on May 18 to register their opposition to ICFRE’s policies. “Our demands are long standing. From May 28 we had been wearing black badges to register our protest,” said C  , secretary of FoSA, IFGTB.
 
 Kunhikannan said if scientists availed medical leaves, their promotion was delayed by six months. 
 
 “Five-year field work is considered for promotion. But if we take medical leaves, our promotions are delayed by six months. We demand that medical leaves should not be considered for promotions,” he said.
 
 Kunhikannan said scientists are being transferred illogically across the sister universities under ICFRE. 
 
 “A scientist who would have acquired good knowledge in a particular field would be transferred to another institute where there would already be scientists who are expert in the same field. The monetary costs of such transfers can be used for research purpose,” he said.
 
 He added that personnel under economic, computer and statistics department were appointed as scientists, but they were not promoted as per modified flexible complementing scheme (MFCS) but were being promoted under the modified assured career progression scheme (MACP).
