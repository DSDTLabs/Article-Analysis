VADODARA: They have never seen colours in their life. But a group of blind persons from the city will be making colourful paintings over next few days. In a bid to spread awareness about blind people and encourage eye donation, Barodians have taken an initiative with the support of district collector P Bharathi. She will also fill the registration form for eye donation on Monday evening. 

 “When I lost my father some months ago, we as a family decided to donate his eyes. I feel content that my father is still around and can see the world through his eyes. And that was when I thought how I can contribute to the cause of eye donation. The idea behind organizing this campaign is to encourage people to donate their eyes,” said art curator, Sachin Kaluskar. 
 
 “As a part of this initiative ‘From the Eyes of the Blind’, 25 blind persons aged between 25 and 45 years will do paintings on canvas. They will touch and feel the colours and it will be a first-of-its-kind experience for them. We want people to realize that if blind persons can paint then what wonders they could do if they could see,” he added.
 
 Bhausingh Bambhaniya, an artist who has been working for blind persons’ cause, will train them in making paintings. “While the district collector has given us major support, Young Indians and Anand Ashram run by K S Chhabra is helping us in getting pledges for eye donation. We want to get at least 25,000 pledges from people before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Gujarat on August 12,” Kaluskar told TOI. 
 
 The plan is to keep these paintings on exhibition near the stage when Modi arrives in Dabhoi on the concluding day of   in the state. “We don’t know how the paintings will be but we will try to sell them. The money raised from the sale will be given to the blind artists,” Kaluskar said.
