GURUGRAM: A city cop, who had been booked for giving a ‘supari’ of Rs 25 lakh to a jailed gangster to bump off a colleague, was dismissed from service on Thursday.

 Interestingly, suspended   Raj   has been sacked not for giving the contract to gangster Surender alias   to kill Raj Kumar, the officer-in-charge of the city’s Crime Unit No. 9, but for holding a press meet in July last year without the permission of higher authorities.
 
 He held that press meet in his defence soon after he was suspended as his name surfaced in a case of intimidation and land grab bid related to gangster Manjeet Mahal.
 
 “A departmental inquiry has found Singh guilty of holding the press meet without the permission of senior police officers. He was served a notice 15 days back. And he has now been dismissed from service,” said Deepak Gahlawat, DCP (headquarters), Gurugram.
 
 However, 52-year-old Singh said he would move court, if required, against his dismissal. “I will appeal to police commissioner first and then to CM, if needed. If I don’t get justice, I may move the court,” he said.
