BHUBANESWAR: The BJD has announced to hold a five-hour protest against the rising prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas across the block headquarters and the districts on Monday.

 Addressing a news conference here,   member   and MLA Sanjay Das Burma said the ‘Haq Pain Hartal (protest for rights)’ from 7am to 12noon will not affect the emergency services anywhere. Adding that the rising fuel prices have adversely affected the common man, Acharya said the fuel prices in India are among the highest in the south Asian region, despite the neighbouring countries depending on the same sources for crude oil.
 
 “There can be no justification for such high fuel prices since the crude prices globally are on a downward spiral. The Centre is favouring certain private companies by keeping the prices exceptionally high,” Acharya said.
 
 The BJP, however, said the BJD is raising the issue of fuel price to divert attention from its own failures. Addressing a news conference, BJP MLA   said the BJD is desperate to shift the focus from its failures by calling a hartal.
 
 The MLA said the manner in which the BJD and the   ganged up in the last day of the monsoon session of the assembly on Saturday and raised the fuel price issue, it was amply clear that it was a deliberate ploy to help the chief minister avoid a discussion on the Bomikhal bridge collapse that killed a man. The two parties protested against fuel price rise in the assembly, washing out a scheduled discussion on the bridge collapse, he said.
