Pune: After suffering a major setback in the 2017 civic election, the Nationalist Congress Party is all set to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party in the by-election scheduled on October 12.

 The election has been necessitated due to the death of senior RPI leader Navnath Kamble, who was also the deputy mayor. Kamble had won the seat from Koregoan Park-Ghorpadi ward on a BJP ticket. The BJP has given ticket to Kamble’s daughter, while the NCP has fielded Dhananjay Gaikwad, indicating that the election won’t be unopposed.
 
 Senior NCP leader Chetan Tupe said, “We are ready for the election. The election is a democratic process and our party is following the process.”
 
 Another senior NCP leader said, “Our party has been targeting BJP over several issues at local, state and national level. It has failed to deal with the price rise, inflation and demonetization. The city has not seen any developmental works in the last six months.”
 
 NCP’s city unit chief Vandana Chavan said despite having a majority in the city, state and at the centre, the BJP has failed to perform. Moreover, the party has not been able to handle the city’s issues in the last six months.
