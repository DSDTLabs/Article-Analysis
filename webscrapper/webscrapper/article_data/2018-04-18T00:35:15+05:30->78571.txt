Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh government is playing safe on Supreme Court’s judgment on Prevention of Atrocities against SC/ST Act. Home minister Bhupendra Singh on Tuesday said SC guidelines in all cases under the Act should be observed, “subject to the Union government’s review petition on the issue”.

 In this context, he asked the DGP’s office to review the directives issued in a state government circular on March 28, 2018, in reference to SC guidelines on SC/ST cases. Singh called a press conference soon after the Chhattisgarh CM directed revocation of an order issued by the police headquarters to strictly implement SC’s decision. The press meet kept getting postponed and was eventually cancelled. 
 
 MP police HQ had issued directives to all range IGs and SSPs to follow SC directives in SC and ST cases. It said that unless there is any other offence requiring arrest, no one should be arrested in SC/ST cases without sanction. If the accused is a public servant, written sanction for arrest has to come from the appointing authority and for others, permission has to come the district’s senior superintendent of police.
 
 And when such an accused is presented before a magistrate, the magistrate must “apply his mind to the reasons recorded” and further detention should be allowed only if the reasons are found to be valid, the order says. To avoid false cases, a preliminary enquiry may be conducted before lodging an FIR to ensure that the case is within the parameters of the Act and is “not frivolous or motivated”.
 
 On March 20, Supreme Court had ordered that cases filed under SC/ST Act must be investigated by DSP-level officers. TOI carried a report on how this was the norm in MP until October 7, 2017, when the state government amended the Act and allowed inspectors to make arrests in such cases. Officials explained that this had to be done because MP sees too many cases under SC/ST Act, but after the SC order they will have to go back to the drawing board.
