Navi Mumbai: The town planning authority may go ahead with phase I of Nerul-Belapur-Uran  , which will connect to Ulwe, without a halt at   to meet the December 2017 deadline, said sources. There are four stations on the new link corridor connecting Ulwe— Sagarsangam, Targhar, Bamandongri and Kharpokar, which falls under Ulwe.   is facing   over portions of mangroves near Sagarsangam.

 The   railway link project is being hurried as it has been shortlisted by PMO on Pragati website for pro-active governance and timely implementation of long-pending infra projects. The authority may also file an affidavit in Bombay High Court to seek a nod on grounds that the mangroves are beyond Panvel creek.
 
 Cidco is the major shareholder of the Nerul-Belapur-Uran rail link with 67:33 equity, along with Central Railway.
 
 Cidco senior PRO, Mohan Ninawe said that they are confident that all the four stations would be operational before the year-end. “Yes, there are issues of mangroves, and we have initiated the process for the green nod. It will be sorted out,” he added.
 
 He also said that tenders for Bamandongri and Kharpokar have been floated and would be finalised soon while tender for Targhar will be floated shortly.
 
 Narendra Patil, CPRO, CR, told TOI on Tuesday that they can deliver on time but Cidco needs to hand over the stations four to five months before December, as track alignment, testing, signalling other works need to be done. It implies that Cidco will have to hand over the stations around August.
