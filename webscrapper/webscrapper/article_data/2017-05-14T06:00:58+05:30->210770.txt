 Athavale applied for adoption under his son Jeet's name. On behalf of Athavale, a party activist from Dahisar, Dilip Wavale, approached the SGNP .“Athavale Saheb is fond of panthers.

 Anwar Ahmed, field director and chief conservator of forests at SGNP, told TOI that SGNP will hand over the certificate to Athavale on Monday. The SGNP started the animal adoption scheme in 2014 due to rising cost of maintenance. Those who adopt an animal are allowed to enter the park free of cost and visit the animal once a week every year. Also, the name of the person is displayed on the cage as a token of appreciation. “ As of now no animal has been adopted. This will be the first for this year,“ said Anwar.
 
 SGNP has 14 leopards, 1 white tiger, 6 tigers, 3 lions and 7 deers available for adoption. The most expensive to adopt is the white tiger (Rs 3.20 lakh yearly). A lion would need Rs 3 lakh, and cheapest would be the barking deer (Rs 10,000).
