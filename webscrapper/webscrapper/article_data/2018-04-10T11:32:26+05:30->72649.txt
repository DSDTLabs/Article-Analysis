PUNE: Kids in the city have never had it so good with several local and international toy stores like   here in recent years. 

 The attractive displays, exhibiting the latest in toy industry, attract children and their parents who then, on an impulse, invest heavily in new toys. 
 
 “Sometimes this is a dead investment as children do not play with the new toy for more than half an hour,” said Gayatri Oswal, a parent.
 
  According to her, the   in toy shops or any other stores dealing in items for children are part of a marketing strategy aimed at driving sales. “The strategy is definitely a success as children throw tantrums if they are denied their favourite toy,” she said.
 
 Suresh Singh, marketing head of Joybox, said that unique displays at their store in Baner draw crowds. 
 
 “We have noticed that when school buses pass by the shop, children look at the store excitedly. The attractive display has prompted children to bring their parents to the store,” he said.
 
 Singh added that parents these days buy educational games which help children develop certain skills. “For children below six years, games and toys help in skill development. But when children get older, a clash of interest arises as they want toys and games according to the latest trend,” he said.
 
 Ashwin Patel of Curtis Toys said that parents generally don’t compromise on buying things for children and shops see this as an opportunity to drive sales. 
 
 “Marketers are definitely seeing children-driven sales as a big opportunity,” he said.
