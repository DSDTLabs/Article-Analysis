AHMEDABAD: While advising legislators to immediately make laws providing for voice spectrography tests of accused persons,   high court observed that due to technical developments, the modus operandi of committing a crime has changed now.

 Justice   observed, “The crime scenario in the country has undergone a sea change in the recent times. Criminals are using the most sophisticated weapons and highly specialised means to achieve their objectives. Highly sophisticated devices like blasting of land mines by remote control are used to thwart the law enforcement machinery from doing its duty. The change in the pattern of crime and mode of its commission requires modern scientific methods of crime detection so that criminals may not move about with impunity holding the entire community at ransom.”
 
 In such cases, the HC feels that voice is the only clue for police and forensic scientists to identify a criminal. It also said that the modus operandi has changed so much that “eyewitnesses have become a rare species now. “Especially in cases of a telephoned bomb threat, demand of money in corruption and kidnapping cases etc. Speech sounds come from the vibration of the vocal cords inside the larynx or voice box. The cavities of the mouth, nose, and throat act as resonators, making the sounds louder. The teeth, lips, tongue, hard and soft palate...shape the sounds into speech,” the court order reads.
