Lucknow: Towering high among all those graduating on Monday and beating all odds to be at the convocation stage of IIM-L,  , a 21-year-old from Jaipur has barely 10% vision because of macular degeneration, a medical condition. As she walked past the many pillars of the institute, calm and conscious of her surroundings, Paridhi said though was a successful finale to management studies, it is “now that my actual struggle begins”.

 But the youngest in the batch is not worried about a job, which she already has in a micro-finance bank as customer relationship executive. “People feel getting a job is the ultimate aim but for me, there are a number of competitive examinations I will now appear for,” she said. Varma wants to eventually become a civil servant and will start preparing for the same. Appearing for CAT was her first ever competitive examination that got her through IIM-L. 
 
 Only child of Satendra Varma and mother Prabha Varma, both employed in defence ministry, Paridhi said there is no improvement in her vision but there is hope with research going on in the field. “Doctors claimed that 95% of my vision is lost but I don’t believe it. I can manage my life well. Instead of what I lack, I focus on my   and rely on other senses of mine,” she said.
 
 Managing with a help to read out lessons and a scribe for writing her exams, Paridhi believes it is her sharp memory that is her special power. “The power to grasp quickly, store it for longer and reproduce it as close to the original as possible are my strength,” she said.
