The guests at a club in Cantt had a great time on New Years Eve. A dance troupe kept the guests entertained and later, it was the DJ who made them all dance to his tunes. At midnight a loud cheer went up as people hugged, kissed and wished each other. Lt Col Shyam Singh Dhami (Retd), the secretary, ensured all things were in order throughout the evening.
