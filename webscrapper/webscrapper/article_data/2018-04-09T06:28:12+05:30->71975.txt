JAIPUR: Police and central paramilitary forces in large numbers were deployed at Vidhyadhar Nagar and other parts of the city on Sunday to disperse members of Shree Rashtriya Rajput   after its activists called for a ‘yagna’ on Sunday and a massive rally on Monday. They wanted to express their multiple demands including that of reservation for economically backward upper castes.

 About 50 activists courted arrests in Murlipura, whereas 10 others were detained in Vidhyadhar Nagar area where a ‘yagna’ was proposed by its leaders.   commissioner   had on Saturday night issued orders refusing permission to Sena’s proposed functions on Sunday and Monday.
 
 “Karni Sena activists gave us a memorandum, which we accepted. However, we categorically told them that no rally would be allowed on Monday,” Agarwal told TOI, adding that nobody would be allowed to disrupt law and order.
 
 The Vidhyadhar Nagar area of the city on Sunday wore a deserted look with companies of central paramilitary forces,   (RAC), and Special Task Force (STF) guarding every nook and corner of the area.
 
 After it was not given permission, the Karni Sena members met Jaipur police officials. “We told police that we are not supporting the   on April 10 and we have also agreed to withdraw our rally on Monday. The police, in turn, agreed to hand over our demands to the state government,” said  , president of Shree Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena.
 
 Jaipur police had been on its toes after the violence that took place during the SC/ST Bharat Bandh on April 2. They drew the ire of people after failing to check chaos that saw cars being vandalized and commercial establishments being attacked.
 
 The BSF and RAC have been stationed in the city ahead of calls for Bharat Bandh on April 10. “No specific organization has come forward with call for Bharat Bandh. As a precautionary measures, we have made elaborate arrangements to meet any untoward situation,” Agarwal said.
