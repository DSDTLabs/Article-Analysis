GHAZIABAD: The   will construct a multi-level   facility adjacent to the   in Indirapuram. On Tuesday, GDA vice-chairperson Ritu   issued directions to its engineering department to prepare a detailed project report following a review of developmental works.

 
 The   will be constructed along the eastern periphery of the park located in the heart of Indirapuram. It will be constructed over nearly 1,600 sqm for accommodating a maximum number of 250 vehicles. The GDA has mooted the public-private partnership (PPP) mode for construction of the parking lot.
 
 “The land over which the project building will be constructed is earmarked for parking in Master Plan 2021. Surface parking is available for visitors on the plot at present. The proposal is to undertake the project in a PPP mode wherein the private partner will operate it for 25 years. The UP government has a policy for   parking lots wherein 25% of space in the building can be used for commercial purposes. The project is sought to be undertaken vide this policy,” Maheshwari told TOI.
 
 The bid documents for the project will be invited later. According to GDA, the multi-level parking lot near Swarn Jayanti Park is similar to the project undertaken by it in Rajnagar District Centre (RDC). The project in RDC is meant for a maximum number of 1,000 vehicles.
