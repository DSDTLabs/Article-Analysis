MUMBAI: Bombay   on Monday extended the bail granted to aspiring Bollywood actor   who was convicted along with two others for conspiring to kill filmmaker  .

 Vacation judge Justice M S Karnik granted her relief from arrest till June 7. The judge also admitted her appeal against the April 28 order of the trial court which sentenced her to three years imprisonment. The same day the trial court had suspended the sentence to enable her to appeal in the HC and granted her cash bail of Rs 15,000 till May 26. Jain has also urged the HC to suspend the jail term and release her on regular bail. The prosecutor sought time to take instructions. “The April 28 order passed by the trial court which is still in operation is extended till June 7,’’ said Justice Karnik, in his order.
 
 In July 2004, Jain then a model and aspiring actor had filed a complaint against Bhandarkar accusing him of raping her 16 times since 1999 under the pretext of giving her a lead role in his films. In 2012 the Supreme Court quashed the rape case against him. Meanwhile, in 2005 Jain was arrested for conspiring to kill Bhandarkar. 
 
 The police claimed she had approached the Akhil Bharatiya Sena to recover Rs 40,000 that she had allegedly paid to one Naresh Pardeshi to eliminate Bhandarkar.
