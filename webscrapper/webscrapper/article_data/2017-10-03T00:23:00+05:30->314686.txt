Jaipur: A 28-year-old trainer in a city gym committed suicide by hanging from ceiling of his rented home situated at Jawahar Circle area in the city. The matter came to light on Monday morning when people in the neighbourhood complained of foul smell coming out of the house.

 According to the police, some locals informed the police about foul smell coming out of the house. A team of police and forensic science laboratory (FSL) also rushed to the spot. A large number of onlookers also gathered at the spot.
 
 “The deceased was identified as Deepak Kumar who was residing along with two other room partners. It appears that he had committed suicide on Dussehra evening on Saturday as the body appears to be two days old,” said a senior police officer.
 
 He was a native of Mahachalprua village of Ajmer and was residing in a rented accommodation situated at sector 5 of Malviya Nagar. “He took paying guest (PG) accommodation almost 20 days ago. Since no suicide note was recovered from the spot it is difficult to say much on the causes which promoted him to commit suicide,” said a senior police officer.
 
 After the police team broke the door the room was stinking and they also saw the decomposed body. “His relatives have been intimated about the incident and a post-mortem would be done after their arrival on Tuesday,” the officer added.
