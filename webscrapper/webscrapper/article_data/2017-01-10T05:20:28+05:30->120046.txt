MUMBAI: Even as the civic body plans to keep the   penguins for public display by next month, Congress legislator   has threatened that his party will not allow the project to be inaugurated. He has demanded that the report of an ongoing probe of alleged irregularities by the contractor for the project be made public. 

 Rane met municipal commissioner   on Monday along with leader of opposition in the House, Pravin Chheda. "The entire project is a big sham," said Rane.
 
 Terming it "very unfortunate" that the coordinator for the penguin project,  , has been appointed as the consultant to manage a bird park that the civic body plans to develop in Powai, Rane alleged that  , the ruling party in the civic house, seems to stand by "corrupt people".
 
 Chheda said Universal Organics had already cheated the civic body by labelling China-made equipment for civic hospitals as those from Britain. "Yet, it was appointed as consultant to develop the bird park," he said. TNN
