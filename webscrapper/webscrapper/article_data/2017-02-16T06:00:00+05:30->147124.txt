Shouting slogans with candles in their hand, around 1,500 people participated in a candle-light march against the decision of the   (LMA) to close 12 roads in the Cantonement area. Organised by the   (FNEC) and supported by the   (OSCAR), the march highlighted the plight of the residents of areas like Neredmet, Kowkur, Yapral, Alwal,  , Balaji Nagar and Safilguda.
Starting out from the AS Rao Nagar grounds, the group slowly made their way to the   roads, and they made sure their presence was felt as they lifted banners like “Roads are lifelines! Don’t close them!”. The tussle between the LMA and the residents of the Cantonement has been going on for a couple of years with neither side relenting. “We are very clear with our lawful and just demands. All the roads have to be reopened for resumption of normal traffic. The current blockade is illegal, and is chocking residents in the North Eastern colonies,” said S Chandrashekar, founder of OSCAR, adding, “What used to be an 800 metre commute for some residents in these areas, has become a eight-kilometre-long drive because of the restrictions.”
 The protesters find the basis of their argument in the Cantonement Act of 2006. “The Act says that restrictions of travel on these roads can only be imposed once public concerns are addressed. But they have bypassed us and gone ahead unilaterally,” argues Chandrashekar.
