THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A day after BJP former president C K Padmanabhan expressed a strong displeasure over the intolerant statements made by BJP state general secretary A N Radhakrishnan against filmmaker Kamal, BJP state president   came out with a   on Sunday to   where showing towards the filmmaker.

 Sharing a 45-second video in which Kamal is seen delivering a speech criticising actor Suresh Gopi and Prime Minister   in strong words, Kummanam said it was how Kamal humiliated Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and actor Suresh Gopi.
 
 In the audio, Kamal is seen saying that it creates fear when film artists, writers or drama artists move close to the right wing camp. In the very brief video, Kamal is heard pitying Suresh Gopi for declaring himself as the slave of Narendra Modi for a   seat. In his speech, Kamal is also seen describing Modi as the champion of the worst massacre the country has ever seen.
 
 Though Kummam did not shower any direct criticism against Kamal, his Facebook post attains political significance as it came on the eve of the state BJP council meeting scheduled in Kottayam. Earlier, Kummanam had not declared open support to Radhakrishnan for his widely criticised statements. But the criticism against Radhakrishnan from within the party might have prompted Kummanam to join the league of leaders who suggested that it would be better for people like Kamal if they leave the country.
 
 There were also rumours that C K Padmanabhan and some other BJP leaders were getting closer to CPM in the state.
 
 Kamal had been under attack from Sangh Parivar outfits for some time over his alleged remarks in connection with the playing of national anthem during the screening of films at the IFFK in December 2016.
