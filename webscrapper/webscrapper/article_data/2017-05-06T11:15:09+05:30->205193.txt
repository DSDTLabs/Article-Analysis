NEW DELHI: The  , who have got their mojo back with two back-to-back wins at home, would be looking to keep the momentum going when they take on the   here at the Kotla on Saturday.

 Unlike the one-dimensional attack of both the Sunrisers Hyderabad and Gujarat Lions, the Mumbai Indian attack -spearheaded by   - would test the Daredevils batsmen because of their variety of slow and fast bowlers. That's why the likes of  , who has earned accolades from all quarters after his exceptional batting on Thursday night against the Lions,   and Shreyas Iyer would again have to excel on Saturday. The battle between Bumrah and Pant could be the high point of the match.
 
 Besides the superior bowling that could test Delhi's inform batsmen, Mumbai are also table-toppers and capable of winning games from the jaws of defeat. They have eight wins out of 10 games. Only Rising Pune Supergiants have beaten them twice in this season.
 
 On the other hand, the Daredevils have lost all their close games but the four wins ­ against Pune, Kings XI Punjab, Sunrisers and Lions ­ have been big ones. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how the Delhi management handles this one. Like always, they have been chopping and changing the playing XI with or without a win. Whatever the combination, this match promises to be a humdinger.
 
 With an eye on the playoff spot, Mumbai are expected to up the ante against the Daredevils. However, the hosts are not thinking that far. After having lost the initial momentum in the tournament, they have picked themselves up in the business end and are hoping to keep their focus.
 
 Delhi went down for a pathetic 67 last Sunday. But the last two wins have seen a sea change in the mindset of the Delhi players.
 
 Right now, the energy level is different and they would be charged up for the big match against Mumbai.
