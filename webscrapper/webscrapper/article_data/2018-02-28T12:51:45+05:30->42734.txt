PATNA: DIG (central range)   has directed officiating Patna SSP   to initiate the process of physical verification of at least 100 police personnel, who are   from duty for more than a year, before initiating the process of their dismissal from service.

 The DIG inspected the Police Lines for five hours on February 22, during which around 200 police personnel were found to be absconding. Of them, 100 have been absconding for more than a year, against whom the physical verification has been ordered.
 
 Kumar had earlier given three days’ time to these police personnel to join duty or face dismissal as per the   Act rules. Only two policemen returned to join their duty at the Police Lines.
 
 The DIG has also ordered that their family members be sent messages about the impending action against them.
 
 Among the 200 ‘absconders’ are 35 SIs or ASIs. It was also found that at least 20 constables had been absconding from duty for more than four years, while 15 others were absconding for more than two years.
 
 “A policeman will go to the postal address of each of the absconding police personnel, available in records of the department, for physical verification,” the DIG said and added the process of dismissal from service would be initiated within a week after the physical verification.
 
 The Patna police consists of around 2,000 officers of the inspector to ASI ranks, 470 havildars and around 6,200 constables.
