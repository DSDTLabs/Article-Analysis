SHIMLA: A day after he was unceremoniously removed from the post of the   Board vice-chairman, Congress leader   raked up the corruption charges against CM Virbhadra Singh, accusing him of "bringing shame to the state". He, however, claimed that he was not going to join BJP and that "he would intensify his war against corruption from within the Congress". 

 Holding a press conference in Shimla on Friday, Mankotia said, "The Congress high command should immediately remove Virbhadra as corruption charges the CM was facing as brought shame to entire state". He added, "Himachal Pradesh is being turned into Bihar and Virbhadra Singh's family is like that of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav". "Entire family of the CM is facing corruption charges," he added. Instead of him being sacked, the governor should have removed Virbhadra Singh in public interest as 80% population of state did not want to see him as chief minister, Mankotia said.
 
 A report of state's own intelligence agencies said that the Congress would not get seats even in single digit in the coming assembly election. "Did you not meet Nationalist Congress Party leaders Sharad Pawar and Prafull Patel before 2012 assembly polls? Did you not give an ultimatum to the Congress high command to appoint himself as state president by removing Kaul Singh Thakur," he asked.
 
 He said  , wife of the CM, had lost parliamentary election of 2014 from Mandi parliamentary seat and the opposition candidate had even got a lead from the assembly constituency of Virbhadra. He alleged that Virbhadra never allowed to develop second line of leadership in state Congress.
 
 Mankotia claimed that he would be a game changer in coming assembly election. He said that he would remain in the Congress and would not join BJP. He announced to intensify his war against corruption and to expose Virbhadra Singh and his close associates. "I will contest the coming assembly election from Shahpur at any cost," he added.
