NEW DELHI: The   on Tuesday refused to grant urgent hearing to a PIL seeking remedial steps to control the terror unleashed by feral dogs in UPâ€™s Sitapur town, where a dozen children have fallen victim to these animals attacks.

 
  mentioned a PIL seeking urgent direction from the SC to the   government but a bench headed by CJI   said it was the task of the local administration to control the situation.
 
 Biju said instead of controlling the terror of stray dogs, which had killed 12 children, the local administration had issued an advisory to people not to allow their children to play outside.
 
 The bench asked the advocate whether he had approached the   on this issue and wondered whether the SC should be hearing PILs on all issues across the country. But as the counsel pressed for an urgent hearing, the bench said the PIL would be listed for hearing in July.
