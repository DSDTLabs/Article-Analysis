PUNE: The   on Thursday arrested a man for allegedly   in their   late on Wednesday night.

 The couple married in May this year and the man suspected his wife of infidelity, police said.
 
 Suspect Deepak Shivaji Jadhav (25) was on the run after murdering his wife Rutuja (18). A team led by senior police inspector Vijaysinh Gaikwad arrested Jadhav before he could escape from the city.
 
 Assistant police inspector V. M. Mhamunkar told TOI that Deepak was Rutuja’s distant relative. Before getting married, Deepak used to drive an auto rickshaw in Mumbai. “The couple got married about two months back and had settled in Pune,” Mhamunkar said.
 
 Deepak was jobless. His parents had rented a room for the newly-wed couple at   in Katraj while Rutuja’s parents helped them with running their house, Mhamunkar said.
 
 Rutuja’s mother Maya Gole, who lodged a complaint with the police, stated that Deepak had been harassing her daughter ever since their marriage. 
 
 On July 18, Rutuja and Deepak had gone to stay with Gole at her house in Patil Estate in Shivajinagar. On Tuesday, Rutuja once again complained against Deepak. When Gole tried to talk with Deepak, he quarrelled with her and went back to his house with Rutuja.
 
 On Wednesday afternoon, Rutuja’s brother Hrishikesh went to Katraj to bring her home on the occasion of ‘Nagpanchami’. However, he had to return home without Rutuja as her room was locked,” Mhamunkar said.
 
 Meanwhile, around 10pm, Gole received a call from her relative who asked her to come to Hadapsar. “When Gole went there, she found Deepak drunk. When she asked the relative about Rutuja, the relative told her that Deepak had throttled her to death,” Mhamunkar said.
 
 Mhamnunkar said that Deepak was arrested on Thursday evening, while he was about to leave the city, he said.
