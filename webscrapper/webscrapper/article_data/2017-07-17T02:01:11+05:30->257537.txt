NEW DELHI:  , often seen as a rich man’s disease, is assuming epidemic proportions among the urban poor in “rich cities” and is more prevalent in states with higher GDP, shows a recent study by the   ( ) across 15 states.

 The findings, published online in ‘The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology’, said Chandigarh, which has the highest per capita annual GDP of $3,433, recorded the highest prevalence of diabetes at 13.6% while  , with the lowest per capita GDP of $682, had the lowest prevalence at 4.3%.
 
 In economically better off states like Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tripura and  , and UTs like Chandigarh, diabetes is more common in rural areas than in urban areas. But in contrast to urban areas, diabetes was more common in individuals of higher socio-economic status in rural areas of all states.
 
 “The spread of diabetes to economically disadvantaged sections of society is a matter of great concern, warranting urgent preventive measures,” the study said. In urban Chandigarh, diabetes among the lower socio-economic strata or poor people was as high as 26.9%, double the incidence (12.9%) for the well off. In Bihar, the trend was reversed with incidence among poor in urban areas only 4.7%, compared to 5.4% among the rich.
 
 Experts identify lifestyle as a major cause of increasing diabetes in affluent states, with the change in eating habits and physical activities emerging as reasons behind the rising trend among urban poor.
 
 The overall prevalence of diabetes in the country was 7.3%, while 10.3% population in the pre-diabetic stage.
 
 The incidence in rural areas was highest in Punjab (8.7%), followed by Chandigarh (8.3%) and Tamil Nadu (7.8%).
