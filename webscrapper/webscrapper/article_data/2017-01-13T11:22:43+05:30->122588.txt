COIMBATORE: The school education department has managed to get away with the present academic year, 2016-17, without prescribing the fees for  . And, if the chairman for the committee is not appointed anytime soont here might be another academic year when both the parents and schools will have to function   on the school fees.

 The former chairman of the private schools fee determination committee, S R Singaravelan's tenure ended on December 31, 2015. More than a year has passed, and the school education department is yet to appoint a new chairman. “At present they (school education department) have appointed the joint director of matriculation schools Sridevi as the incharge. They are listening to the petitions that come in front of them, but, there are hardly any decisions taken,“ said an officer of the school education department.
 
 The committee comprises five membersthe directors of school education, matriculation schools and elementary education, an engineer from the public works department and an officer at the joint secretary level from the school education department. “The state government managed in 2016-17 without a fee prescription in place. They either asked schools to follow the fees prescribed for 2015-16, or came to a mutual consensus if the schools had a problem.This created confusion,“ the officer said.
 
 The school education minister K Pandiarajan was unavailable for comment. However, a senior official of the department said, “We are in the process of appointing the new chairman. An announcement will be made soon.“
