Hyderabad: In a major setback for city-based drug major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL), the US drug watchdog – United States Food and Drug Administration -- has given 13 observations in its re-audit of the Duvvada unit in Visakhapatnam.

 “The audit of our formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam, by the USFDA has been completed today (Wednesday). We have been issued a Form 483 with 13 observations, which we are addressing,” the company informed the National Stock Exchange. According to USFDA, FDA Form 483 is issued to a firm at the conclusion of an inspection when the investigators observe any conditions that, in their judgement, may constitute violations of the Food Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and related Acts. The FDA Form 483 notifies the company’s management of objectionable conditions.
 
 The oncology formulations facility at Duvvada was initially inspected in February 2015 by USFDA after which it had issued warning letters raising concerns over violations of good manufacturing practices (GMP) at the unit. Following this, DRL had carried out extensive remediation work at its unit and had requested USFDA to reaudit the facility.
 
 Last month, DRL had informed that USFDA re-audited its API manufacturing unit at Miryalaguda in Telangana and issued a Form 483 with three observations. “The audit of the company's API manufacturing plant at Miryalaguda by the USFDA has been completed on February 21, 2017. The company has been issued a Form 483 with three observations, which the company is addressing,“ DRL had informed the bourses earlier. tnn
