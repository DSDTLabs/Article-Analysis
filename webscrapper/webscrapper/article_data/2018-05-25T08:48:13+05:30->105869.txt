CHANDIGARH: After the fee hike for existing and new entrants, Panjab   is now considering a 5% fee hike for   nationals, PIO and   students. This has been proposed for both new entrants and existing foreign/NRI students. The matter will be tabled in the Syndicate meeting scheduled for May 26. 

 
  
 
 The committee constituted by vice-chancellor Prof   held a meeting to finalise the fee structure for foreign nationals and NRIs on April 9 and decided to enhance the fee by 5%. 
 
 For LLB (3-year course), the tuition fee was Rs 26,760 per annum and after 5% hike, it would be Rs 28,100. The tuition fee for BE (UIET) is proposed to be increased from Rs 81,000 to Rs 85,050 for foreign nationals and NRI sudents. For MPharmacy, the tuition fee is proposed to be increased from Rs 1,84,080 per annum to Rs 1,93,285 per annum. 
 
 Admission of NRI students to engineering institutions of the University, including UIET and Dr SSBUICET, will be conducted through direct admissions students abroad (DASA) from the 2018-19 session. Seats for eligible foreign nationals will be in addition to the seats already notified, subject to maximum of 5% of the total sanctioned seats of the course. Foreign students who want to get enrolled for PhD will have to be sponsored by a government body subject to the approval of the department concerned. 
 
 International students who have been studying in India and are present in India at the time of the common entrance test for PhD will have to take the test. If the candidates are not in India during the CET, they are required to have at least achieve band 5 in IELTS or 60 in TOEFL or 150-154 in GRE or 600 in GMAT. All candidates will have to qualify the interview. The same exemption will be given in MPhil programmes.
