Rajkot: A 55-year-old farmer committed suicide in his farm in Khared village near Mahua town of Bhavnagar district on Thursday night.

 Jayanti Bambhaniya was found hanging in the farm by his family members. Bambhaniya had left his house saying that he was going to a temple, but when he did not return till 9 pm, the family members began searching for him. Before a month, his younger brother Kana had eloped with a girl from Koli family. Her father had also lodged a complaint with Mahua police station.
 
 Bambhaniya’s family alleged that he was fed up of frequent questioning by the police about Kana’s whereabouts. They also alleged that he was being beaten up by the cops, which ultimately led him to take the drastic step.
 
 However, police inspector, Mahua police station, B K Chaudhary dismissed the charges as baseless. Police claimed that Bambhaniya feared losing his respect in the community and hence ended his life.
