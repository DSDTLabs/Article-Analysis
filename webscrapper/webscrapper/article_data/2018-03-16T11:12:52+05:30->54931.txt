MADURAI: Seeking CB-CID probe, D   of Trichy whose wife Usha died after their two-wheeler was kicked by a traffic inspector, has filed a petition before the Madurai bench of the Madras high court.

 According to Raja, on March 7 he and his wife were stopped by police near   toll plaza. He opposed the traffic police’s handling of bike riders and moved forward. The inspector,   who witnessed this followed him and abused him using filthy language. This was objected by Usha. The petitioner also told him that his wife was pregnant. But, the inspector without considering anything kicked the bike. This led him to lose control of his bike and fall down on the road along with his wife. Later, his wife died. 
 
 He further said that the Trichy police would not take proper action in the case. “Now, police said that the case has been transferred to the district crime branch. Actually, the crime branch is also under the control of the Trichy police. I have no faith in them because there is a strong suspicion that the Trichy police would drag the case. Besides, the police who wanted to save the accused (inspector) started threatening me in various ways not to proceed further in the case. Hence, the case should be transferred to the CB-CID,” the petitioner claimed.
