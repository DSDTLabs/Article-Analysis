PATNA: Work is likely to begin soon on six ropeways at different places in  , including three at   and one each at Jehananbad, Kaimur and Rohtas.

 Tourism department officials informed that funds to the tune of Rs 67.09 crore were sanctioned for the six ropeway projects by the state government in 2016-17. A sum of Rs 12.65 crore was sanctioned for a ropeway at Rohtasgarh in Rohtas and Rs 7.35 crore for   in Kaimur. Gaya district, on the other hand, will get three ropeways at Brahmayoni Hills (Rs 4.24 crore), Dungeshwari Hills (Rs 8.43 crore) and Pretshila Hills (Rs 10.49 crore). Also, funds to the tune of Rs 23.92 crore were sanctioned for another ropeway at Barabar Hills in Jehanabad district.
 
 “Most religious places in Bihar are located in mountainous regions and the best way to reach them is through ropeways. All the six ropeways, for which funds have been sanctioned, will be cabin-type with a seating capacity for four people. Their length, however, will vary from place to place,” state tourism director Ashok Kumar Singh told this newspaper on Monday.
 
 According to sources, the Rohtasgarh ropeway has been issued a no objection certificate (NOC), but other ropeway projects are still in the pipeline and are yet to receive NOCs from the state forest department.
 
 Besides, the tourism department has also proposed to set up three more ropeways in the state — the first at Kakolat falls in Nawada district, the second one at Umga Hills in Aurangabad and the third at Gurpa Hills in Gaya.
 
 “Work on two ropeways being constructed at Ratnagiri Hills under the Pant Wildlife Sanctuary in   district and   in Banka district is almost complete. They are likely to be operational by July this year,” Singh said, adding the new ropeways would ease the difficulty of travelling for international tourists and attract domestic tourists.
