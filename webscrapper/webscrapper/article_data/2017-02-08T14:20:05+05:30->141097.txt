GAYNA: The functioning of   has come to a   as the vacuum caused by the   (VC) Md Ishtiaque entered the fifth day on Tuesday. The VC had resigned on February 2. The post of pro-VC is also lying vacant.
 
  The VC's resignation and the vacancy of the post of pro-VC has made the university virtually headless, thereby causing concern to the nearly half a million students enrolled in the 44 constituent colleges, 24 PG departments, four   and 100 plus affiliated colleges spread over seven districts, including Patna, Gaya, Nalanda, Nawada and Aurangabad.
  
  Though before submitting his resignation, Ishtiaque ordered salary payment to the teachers and employees working in the university headquarters from the internal resources of the university, the two-month salary grant released by the government for payment to the 4,000 teaching and non-teaching employees of the colleges has not been transferred to the respective salary accounts of the employees, as by the time the grant was received by the university, the VC had already resigned and alternative arrangements have not been made by the chancellor’s office.
  
  The employees remain unpaid for nearly four months now and they will have to wait at least till the February 10, when Kusum Kumari, the senior most professor of the university, will assume charge as interim VC. The MU vacuum is attributed to the absence of governor-cum-chancellor Ram Nath Kovind, who is on a five-day tour to Cambodia.
  
  MU registrar Nalin Kumar Shastri said he was waiting for a direction from the chancellor’s office in view of the resignation of Ishtiaque.
