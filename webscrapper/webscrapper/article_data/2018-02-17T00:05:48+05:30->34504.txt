Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Forest Department is setting up a vertical adventure park at the base point of Masai plateau. The park will offer a range of games like zip line, climbing ball, rock climbing and rappelling at affordable rates. The department is also contemplating to set up a para-sailing unit for adventure enthusiasts at the plateau.  Officials said only the final touches of the park are left which will be completed in a few weeks.  The district planning committee (DPC) has allotted over Rs 1 crore for the project. District collector Avinash Subhedar is keeping a close tab on the project development. Prabhunath Shukla, deputy forest conservator, Kolhapur, told TOI that the adventure park will be spread across 1 hectare land near the base point of Masai plateau under Jiur gram panchayat’s limit. The tests of various games will start soon. He added that in the first phase, five ecofriendly residential tents have been set up at the said location. Apart from this, the adventure park will have a canteen, a toilet facility as well as a walking track. Set in the foothills of the Western Ghats and Panhala fort, the park will also have a playground for children along with several fun rides.  The area is rich in biodiversity. “The flora and fauna is different here and we are sure that people visiting here will fall in love with the place,” he said. Shukla added the experts will be appointed for giving information on the various traditional adventure games. A joint forest management committee of Jiur gram panchayat will look after the overall arrangements once the project completes.
