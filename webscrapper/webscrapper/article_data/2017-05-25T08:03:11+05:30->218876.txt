CHANDIGARH:   sleuths on Wednesday claimed to have laid hands on a firm allegedly involved in ‘accommodation entries’ to siphon off taxable amounts under the garb of sale purchase of rice to mill owners in Karnal.

 The raid, which began on Monday, continued till Wednesday evening. The firm, identified as  , is a broker for rice shellers and commission agents. The nexus came to light after the a team headed by joint commissioner of income tax (JCIT) Vandana Mohite raided the firm’s premises at the new grain market in Karnal.
 
 The team, which included three income tax officers, recovered a cash of Rs 1.11 crore from the premises. The investigations wing headed by a deputy director level officer too was rushed to the premises. The entire operations were closely monitored by K S Jain, principal chief commissioner of income tax,  , and chief commissioner of income tax, Haryana, Sunita Puri, principal commissioner, Karnal, P S Tomar supervised the field operations.
 
 “The team had gone for a routine survey during which documents like signed blank cheque books of Delhi-based bogus parties were found from whom only bills were taken. It was detected that the proprietary concern was giving fake entries to the tune of several hundreds of crores of rupees of rice purchase and sales to different rice millers and shellers after obtaining a commission from them. This raised an eyebrow and we informed our bosses in Chandigarh,’’ said Vandana.
 
 The investigation team is on the job and accommodation entries and the number of beneficiaries will be quantified after investigation is over. With the help of accommodation entries, the beneficiary rice millers have reduced taxable income causing huge loss to the state exchequer by evading VAT and Mandi Tax, etc, Vandana added.
