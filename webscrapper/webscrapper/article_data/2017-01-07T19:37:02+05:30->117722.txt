PATNA: Deputy   on Friday downplayed the brouhaha over his father and RJD chief   not getting a seat on the dais with PM   and CM   during the Prakashotsava function at Gandhi Maidan on Thursday.
 
  “The seating arrangement at the stage was done as per the protocol for the Prime Minister. When Lalu ji has not expressed any reservations over sitting in the VIP lobby in front of the dais, other people should also not create an issue out of it,” said Tejashwi.
  
  Senior RJD functionary Raghuvansh Prasad Singh sparked a controversy over the issue soon after the conclusion of the main event of the 350th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Gobind Singh by saying that public sentiment was hurt as Lalu was not allowed to sit on the dais along with the PM and CM.
  
  Tejashwi was sitting with Lalu and his elder brother and environment minister   in the VIP lobby, along with senior leaders from several other parties, including senior BJP functionaries Prem Kumar and Sushil Kumar Modi, at the event on Thursday.
  
  Raghuvansh, however, said Nitish should have ensured Lalu’s seat on the dais. He also alleged that Nitish took the entire credit of successfully organizing the Prakashotsava and ignored his Grand Alliance partners in the government.
  
  On being asked about Raghuvansh’s statement, Tejashwi said, “I don’t want to comment on what Raghuvansh has said as he is a senior leader and has a mind of his own.”
  
  JD(U) also criticized Raghuvansh for raising a non-issue. “Lalu ji is a senior leader and has not said anything against the seating arrangement at Gandhi Maidan. But Raghuvansh is trying to create a controversy over the issue. He always speaks against the CM and tries to create rupture in the alliance,” JD(U) spokesperson Sanjay Singh said.
