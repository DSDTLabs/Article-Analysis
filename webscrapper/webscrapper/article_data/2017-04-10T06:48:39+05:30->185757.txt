RAJKOT: The spate of arrests of   continued with the   (PMSA) apprehending 42 fishermen with their seven boats near the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) off Jakhau coast early on Sunday. 

 The fishermen belong to Okha and Mangrol towns, said Manish Lodhari, secretary, National Fishworkers’ Forum. 
 
 “We got a message at around 3am that 18 fishermen in three boats were captured by PMSA. Later, we got confirmation about four more boats with 24 fishermen on board,” Lodhari told TOI. The captured boats had set sail from the coastal town of Porbandar a few days ago, he said.
 
 This is the first such incident in April, Lodhari said, adding that in March alone, the Pakistani authorities had arrested 231 Indian fishermen and seized 40 boats. 
 
 On March 26, PMSA had apprehended over 100 Indian fishermen and seized 19 boats near the IMBL.
 
 Since the beginning of this year, as many as 315 fishermen with 54 boats have been apprehended by Pakistan. 
 
 “We have often advised the fishermen not to go close to the IMBL. But it is only a notional boundary and fishermen often venture close to it in the night as they can get a huge catch of fish,” Lodhari said.
 
 At least 400 fishermen are still languishing in Pakistani jails.
