Pune: A 26-year-old man riding pillion was killed after the motorcyclist, who was speeding, lost control over the vehicle and hit the pavement after entering the other side of the road. The accident took place near Khadki railway station on the Pune-Mumbai highway around 12.30pm on Friday.

 The deceased Namdev Vitthal Sarvade (26) from Baner and injured Anil Hanumant Bhosale (22) from Aundh were not wearing helmets, Khadki police said.
 
 Assistant inspector Dilip Salunke said the duo was heading towards Pune via Aundh when Bhosale lost control over the vehicle and entered the wrong side of the highway and hit the pavement. 
 
 Salunke said the impact was such that Sarvade received multiple injuries on his head while Bhosale sustained injuries on the face and legs. Both of them were rushed to a nearby private hospital, but Sarvade succumbed to injuries before he could be given treatment.
 
 “We have booked Bhosale for causing death of Sarvade due to negligence under the Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act on the basis of a statement given by an eye witness, autorickshaw driver Mohammad Shaikh (27), from Pimpri,” Salunke added.
