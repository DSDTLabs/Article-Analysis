Gurgaon:  ,   (DPSG) in   on Thursday met Haryana PWD minister  , who is Badshapur MLA, and apprised him of the latest developments in the fee hike row.   said they also went to police station to file an FIR against the school.

 “We filed an FIR because school has duped us,” said Jasvinder Singh, a parent. “The school management suddenly announced the change of ownership. As per the rules, under the new branding, the school can operated till Class 3. But they sought fee from students of higher classes, including class 12, also. How can they do that if they had no recognition?” he said.
 
 Parents said when the government tried to scrutinise the school, the management closed it down. 
 
 Parents said Narbir Singh assured them that all proceedings in the DPSG case had already been sent to additional chief secretary (education) PK Das in Panchkula. “The recent order issued by Gurgaon divisional commissioner D Suresh was not abided by the school,” Yadav said. “It is a clear case of contempt. The school says it’s just proceeding, and not an order. But they are forgetting DC is magisterial authority.”
 
 Parents said Narbir Singh assured that that the district authorities would likely receive guidelines from Panchkula, outlining the enforcement, regarding the orders of D Suresh, barring the school from hiking fee. Calls made to Rao Narbir Singh by TOI went unanswered.
