Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court has quashed an FIR accusing two city doctors of negligence, which had led to the death of a child.

 The doctors also cited a judgment of the Supreme Court in Dr Jayashree versus State of Maharashtra case, where it ruled that “the act of doctors may be an error in judgment, but is definitely not a rash and negligent act contemplated under section 304A IPC”.
 
 The FIR was lodged by Uttam Walde against Dr Pradeep Wankhede and Dr Abhishek Sondawale, accusing them of negligence in their duty, due to which he lost his child. The complaint was lodged at Lakadganj police station on May 16, 2016. The doctors moved the court through counsels Rajendra Daga and Rohan Malviya to quash the FIR.
 
 According to the petitioner, on December 30, 2015, the newborn was admitted at a hospital when the child’s condition deteriorated. Two days later, the child was shifted to another hospital, where he was kept for a week under observation. On the night of January 11, 2016, the condition of the child worsened.
 
 Dr Wankhede examined the child and gave medicines. However, the next morning, the condition of the child became serious and it was taken to Dr Sondawale’s hospital. Looking at the serious condition of the child, Dr Sondawale referred him to the original hospital, where the child was pronounced brought dead.
 
 A case of negligence was registered against the doctors under IPC 304-A. A report was also obtained by police from Medical Board (MB), which accused Dr Wankhede of not offering proper treatment and Dr Sondawale of not admitting the child.
 
 The petitioners’ counsels contended that Dr Sondawale didn’t have facilities to treat the child, and Dr Sondawale didn’t provide any medical assistance to the child and therefore can’t be termed as negligent.
