 MA Khan, principal of KK English School in Varthur, said: “Students in cities have more distractions like gadgets, especially cellphones. Many of them spend hours glued to their phones and social media. Secondly, many students and parents depend on tuitions. If they revise the chapter after it’s taught in class, it would be more useful for students. Parents don’t keep track of how much their wards are learning in tuitions.”
 
 Sudha Naik, principal of St Ann’s High School in Rajajinagar, agrees. “Urban kids are distracted even during exam season, and mobile phones are primarily to blame. They are less attentive in class too. Most urban parents own multiple gadgets, which are accessible to their kids. On the contrary, children in villages pay attention in class and follow their teachers’ advice. That’s why the pass percentage in rural schools has been higher for some years now,” she said.
 
 Mohan Kumar, principal of BGS Rural English School in Chikkaballapura, said rural kids are more focused because they are aware of their parents’ struggles. “Many of them also have cellphones and take tuitions, but they aren’t distracted like city children. They work harder to compete with their urban counterparts,” he told TOI.
 
 The education department and department of public instruction have made efforts to improve pass percentage in rural areas. Philomina Lobo, director of public instruction (secondary education), said, “Block education officers and DDPIs have taken special interest in increasing pass percentage. We give more attention to weaker students through extra practice sessions. Many teachers take extra classes. In a few villages, teachers even conducted night classes. Students lacking confidence were counselled.”
