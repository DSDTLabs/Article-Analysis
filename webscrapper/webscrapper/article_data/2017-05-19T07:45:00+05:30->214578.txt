GURGAON:   are facing a tough time crossing the   after sunset owing to non-functional traffic signals, slow pace of road construction work and dug-up stretches. The road, according to commuters, is in a dilapidated condition.

 Surprisingly, after 8pm, there is only one traffic policeman to man the entire west zone, from Kapashera border to Sector 10. The road turns chaotic as hundreds of factory workers and office-goers leave their workplaces around this time. On Wednesday night, traffic was stuck for over half an hour r at the Palam Vihar T-point, leaving commuters crambling to find alternative routes.
 
 DCP (traffic) Balbir Singh assured that things should get better on Friday. “There have been numerous complaints about this road. I will visit the spot with road safety officers (RSOs) and see what needs to be done. To begin with we are extending duty time of   by one hour,” he said.
 
 However, commuters demand more credible solutions. “In the absence of proper public transport, people are forced to buy vehicles. The authorities have to make sure that traffic lights work and there are adequate number of cops on the road so that people drive in a civilised manner,” said Gautam Aggarwal, a commuter.
