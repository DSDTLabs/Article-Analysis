BENGALURU: A   since February 28 from her house in Magadi, 35km from the city, was found murdered on Friday.

 Ayesha Mohammed Nurulla, daughter of Mohammed Nurulla, and a class IV student of a  , is suspected to be a victim of witchcraft. Nurulla, a daily wage labourer, filed a complaint with Magadi police on Tuesday night stating that his only daughter had gone missing after she stepped out of the house at 8.30pm. “My wife was preparing dinner and I was taking bath. Ayesha was sitting and reading something, when I heard her respond to someone. The person who called her must have been standing near the house,“ said Nurulla. His wife heard Ayesha open the door and walk out.
 
 On Saturday evening, dogs sniffing a gunny bag dumped near a  , about 2km from Nurulla's house, drew the attention of passersby. “When we went near the bag, we were shocked to see a head. We realized there was a child's body in it,“ villagers told police.
 
 Alerted by locals, police arrived at the spot and opened the bag which had Ayesha's body in it. “The crowd panicked when they saw camphor, turmeric and some other material near the body. Villagers say the girl has been killed by a black magician,“ said Magadi police.
 
 Ayesha's hands and legs were tied and her mouth was stuffed with plastic and clothes. Police are still not sure if she was sexually assaulted.
