KOLKATA: With the city all set to get its third  , the state urban development department has started laying a roadmap to develop connectivity with the upcoming township. Once the 7km road, which will run along the bheris in the Dhapa area, is built,   between Sector V and Basanti Highway will be reduced by half. 

 An engineering team of Jadavpur University has been engaged to draw up the detail project report and design the new connector. The state government recently constituted the Bantala Industrial Township Authority that will work on developing Sector VI — the new IT hub on Basanti Highway. 
 
 The Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA) has started working on plans to set up the road from the Sector V end. A survey has been initiated to chalk out a blueprint of the proposed road. The construction work will start once the JU team submits its report and the final project report is being drawn up.
 
 According to plans, the connector would start from the Ring Road in Sector V, cross the bheri areas in Thakdari, Khasmahal, Choynavi and Chakher Bheri to connect with Basanti Highway at Bantala Bazar crossing. A major portion of the new road will pass through NDITA and Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation areas before reaching Bantala Leather Complex.
 
 Since the proposed road will move through a predominantly bheri area, which is a Ramsar site, extra attention is being paid so that rules are not flouted anywhere. “The road route has to be carefully designed so that it does not violate the wetland norms,” said an official. 
 
 Presently, motorists driving to Bantala have to move along EM Bypass before taking Basanti Highway from near the Science City crossing. There is a longer route for motorists, which passes through the panchayat areas just behind New Town.
