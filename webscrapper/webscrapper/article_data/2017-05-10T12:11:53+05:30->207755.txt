PANAJI: The Goa IT professionals ( ) has expressed its reservations on the state government’s decision to procure 45,000 laptops for school kids. The state government intends to clear the backlog of laptop distribution for Class XI and XII students under the cyberage scheme and has earmarked Rs 86 crore for it.

 “While this scheme has had scattered positive impact in the past, it has also had its lion’s share of allegations and issues of sub-standard hardware being procured at higher than market prices, misuse and selloff by recipients,” the association’s statement read, adding that the scheme itself has suffered poor end-user utilization due to unsuitability of supplied laptops for diverse usage.
 
 GITP president   said that one common laptop configuration cannot cater to varied student requirements considering their education streams and interests. “A single vendor bagging such large state-level orders for commoditized items like laptops is adversely affecting the local technology small vendors and related economy in Goa. There are industry grade free open source software ( ) options available today, most generic traditional software needs of students can thus be catered for free today without spending precious public funds,” he said, adding that the comptroller and auditor general of India (CAG) has also sought re-evaluation of the cyberage scheme on the basis of its observations and feedbacks.
