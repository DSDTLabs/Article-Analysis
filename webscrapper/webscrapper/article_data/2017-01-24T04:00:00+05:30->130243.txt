VADODARA: While most   hit the roads out of passion,  , a   with a   in Mumbai, rode across 29 states and five union territories all alone to promote rural tourism in the country.

 Balakrishnan, who started her tour from Mumbai in September last year, was in the city on Saturday during the last leg of the tour. 
 
 Balakrishnan had travelled around 50,000 kilometres and will be completing her journey on Sunday in Mumbai.
 
 “Apart from experiencing local traditions and cultures, I wanted to break the stereotypical perceptions that people hold about different regions of the country,” said Balakrishnan, who lives with her mother and sister in Kandivili. 
 
 “In cities, our lives have become fast and our rich traditions and cultures are fast depleting. But in the interior areas of the country, people have still not forgotten their age old cultures and this is what I wanted to experience,” she said.
 
 After starting her tour, she went straight to Jammu & Kashmir and then to Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. Balakrishnan also met with an accident when she was in Punjab and had to take rest for nine days.
 
 After covering northern states of the country, she went to the north-east, eastern states, then south India, central part and then came back to western India. 
 
 Balakrishnan told TOI: “When I was in the mountainous region, I could cover only 150 km a day but once I was back on plains, I easily covered around 500 km daily.”
 
 “In villages, people would be surprised to see me but at the same time I received lot of respect from them,” she said.
