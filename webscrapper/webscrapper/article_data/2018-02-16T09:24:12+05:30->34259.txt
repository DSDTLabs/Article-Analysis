JAIPUR: BJP MLA  , who has been at loggerheads with chief minister   and party state president Ashok Parnami over BJP’s pathetic performance in recent bypolls, said on Thursday that he would accept whatever the central leadership decided for him.

 A day earlier, state BJP’s disciplinary committee met and decided to forward a report on MLA Ahuja’s controversial statements to party’s central disciplinary committee. An audio clip in which Ahuja can be heard speaking against the state leadership to one of his supporters over the phone after the party’s bypoll defeat, had gone viral on Sunday. Saying that Raje, Parnami and minister   were “badnaam” (infamous), the BJP MLA told his supporter that he had demanded change of guard in Rajasthan before the bypolls.
 
 Talking to reporters at the assembly premises on Thursday, the BJP MLA from Ramgarh (Alwar) said the party state disciplinary committee has recommended action against him for speaking the truth. “I am paying for speaking the truth. Those who never struggled have been rewarded,” Ahuja said.
 
 The MLA said he would soon make a big exposure but fell short of telling what it would be about. “Aaj amavashya hai, jyada nahi bolunga (today is no moon day, will not speak much),” Ahuja said.
 
 While BJP state disciplinary committee has recommended action against  , its similar recommendation to the central committee against BJP MLA   has been lying in cold storage. Tiwari gave detailed replies to the central disciplinary committee, which had sought explanations from him for opposing the state leadership. In his replies, Tiwari made even sharper attacks on Raje but has remained unscathed till date. In fact, Tiwari has increased his attacks on Raje in the budget session that is currently on.
