NAVI MUMBAI: More than 60 buildings in the   housing scheme in   have been left without a functional fire-fighting system even after allotment of the flats way back in 2005. Some of the fire safety equipment was stolen by thieves before the flats were handed over. 

 There are 61 buildings in the housing scheme with as many as 1,456 flats. The flat owners have been affected and their safety compromised as   did not care to put in place a functional fire-fighting system, complained residents.
 
  The buildings have been provided with fire-fighting systems, but during the handover of the flats, some of the fire-fighting equipment were allegedly stolen.
 
 JKLM Spaghetti cooperative housing society member, Shivaji Patil alleged, “Safety issues should not be ignored by the Cidco.”
 
  The scrap dealers have stolen the fire-fighting system at the time of construction and Cidco is yet to replace them, said another resident.
 
 Referring to a meeting with Cidco, joint MD that was held last year, Prime Rose cooperative housing member cum corporator   said, “It was decided that the fire-fighting system and lifts should be handed over in presence of then Cidco superintending engineer. But repeated reminders since then have not elicited any response. A PWD or lift inspector has to give the clearance to hand over the lifts to the housing societies.”
 
 Residents fear that they might have to face a dangerous situation in case of a fire incident at any point of time. Cidco’s Kharghar node administrator Sitaram Rokade said, “We are looking into the issue and will take a call soon.”
