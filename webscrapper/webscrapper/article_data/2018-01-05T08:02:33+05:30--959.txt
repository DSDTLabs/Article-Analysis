BHOPAL: Water shortage in Chambal river after scanty rainfall in its catchment area has changed its characteristics leading to huge disturbance in the habitat of highly endangered gharial (Gavialis gangeticus). 

 Thick sand mounds on the river banks or ghats identified as haven for the breeding of the reptile are missing.
 
 Experts believe this may "affect adversely" the very existence of the critically threatened reptile.
 
 Of the 47 ghats in the river in Morena alone, 12 have been identified as favourable for gharial breeding. 
 
 As the flow of the river declines drastically, the sand volume accumulated on these banks has also thinned down.
 
 In the ghats with 4 feet to 6 feet depth of sand, the layer of the sand as gone down to barely two-and-a-half feet, sources said. 
 
 "When a gharial lays eggs, it digs deep. Because of non-availability of sand, the reptile may have to lay eggs on soil harming the eggs," sources in   said.
 
  forest officer Morena A A Ansari confirmed, "There is water scarcity and the animals are forced to live in deep water pool. The December 2017 reading of water flow has also shown a drastic decline in its flow as compared to the figure of December 2016 year." 
 
 No doubt, Ansari said, the nesting habitat has been threatened by the shortage of water. "Actual impact of this scarcity will be known only after detailed survey in March next year," he said.
 
 And as the river shrinks, disturbances associated with sowing, use of diesel pumps to lift water to fields and the easy access of humans to the remote parts of the river have also gone up menacingly, sources said.
 
  Shortage of water has already shown one trend. In the absence of thick volumes of sand, the deadly crocodiles and gharials are seen sharing the same river bank.
 
 "This may lead to confrontation between the two reptiles as they share the food and the habitat," said  , retired superintendent of the sanctuary.
