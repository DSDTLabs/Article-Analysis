PUNE: The Wanowrie police on Sunday arrested two jobless men for stealing three motorbikes. 

  (30) from   and Shaikh Khurshid Rashid Ahmed (26) from Handewadi have allegedly been stealing motorbikes since 2016 to make fast money after they lost their jobs.
 
 The duo made several attempts to sell the bikes to prospective customers but failed. 
 
 They then tried to dispose of the vehicles at a cheap rate but ran out of luck after a police team led by sub-inspector Ravindra Bagul arrested them, following a tip.
 
 The suspects had stolen two motorbikes from a housing society in Handewadi and another vehicle near race course. The suspects usually broke the handle-lock of the bikes and pulled the ignition wire to start the vehicles.
