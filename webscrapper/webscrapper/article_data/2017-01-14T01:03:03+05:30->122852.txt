CHENNAI: A consumer forum here has directed   India Electronic Pvt Ltd,Gurgaon and its Chennai regional office and service centre to pay 48,000 to a city resident for selling him a defective TV. 

 In a complaint, M   of Kolathur said he bought a Samsung HD LED TV for 33,000 from   in GNT road on October, 14, 2013. After 10 days, he found that the TV would switch off on its own and then restart. He registered two complaints with the customer services of the manufacturer at Gurgaon and its regional office at Mylapore. Two technicians tried to repair the TV without any result. Sivaprakasam then sent several representations to the manufacturer and regional office, but of no avail. Finally, he approached the authorized service provider,   in Tondiarpet. The service provider took the TV to its centre for repair and returned it after two days. Instead of resolving the problem, Sivaprakasam found that the TV along with the earlier problem, was now emitting some sound. tnn
