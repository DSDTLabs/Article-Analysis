MADURAI: The summer is yet to start, but Madurai city is already reeling under water scarcity. The water level has already gone down in borewells in many pockets as a result of which the demand for the water supplied by the tanker trucks has escalated. Water price has been going north with 1,000 litres sold for up to Rs 300. 

 Since 1,000 litres will last hardly for two or three days for a family of four, residents have been shelling out Rs 1,500 to Rs 3,000 a month on it. With the demand increasing, the price is expected to increase. Residents have been complaining that they could not get water on time as the tanker trucks are busy.
 
 Usually, March and April are the months when borewells in households disappoint residents as the water level runs several feet down. But this year, the level has gone down already due to failure of both the monsoons last year. Most of the newly added areas where piped drinking water connection is still a distant dream have also been affected. 
 
 Venkatesh Alagar from   said “Although corporation is supplying water through tanker trucks, it is not reaching many households. The drivers would stop by at important junctions from where residents need to carry through pots, which many do not like. They will prefer to shell out money instead.” 
 
 K  , a resident of  , said “while last year our borewell failed to yield water from only mid-March, this year the issue has started already. For the past two weeks we have been buying tanker water. Since the demand has gone up tankers supply water only a day after I book,” she said. 
 
 A manager of tanker water supplier said that they had been receiving double the number of phone calls in recent days. At times, they could not supply immediately as promised to the customers. They are planning to add a couple of vehicles to the fleet to meet the demand, he said.
