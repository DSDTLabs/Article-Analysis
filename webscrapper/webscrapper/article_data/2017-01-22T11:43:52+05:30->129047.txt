NEW DELHI: It was touch and go there for a while, but the   finally announced today that it has forged an alliance with the Samajwadi Party (SP) and will contest from 105 seats in the upcoming 
  . 
 
 Over the past few days, a Congress-SP alliance was looking remote as 
  he wouldn't offer the Congress a chance to contest from more than 100 seats. The Congress wanted to contest as many as 121 seats.
  
 Yesterday, Akhilesh said his final offer was 99-100 seats for the Congress. That the Congress says it managed to wrangle 105, means it managed to save some face after what seemed to be a 'take it or leave it'offer from Akhilesh. Congress chief   may have had something to do with it, as SP sources yesterday claimed she took charge of negotiations which remained stuck despite 
  dispatching her personal emissary to cajole Akhilesh. 
 
 Congress strategists felt that they should accept the SP's offer rather than risk electoral humiliation. So far, the SP and the   remain the most viable challengers for the  's bid to form the government in UP. Teaming up with Akhilesh offers Congress a way out of the political bind as it could project its plans as a "sacrifice for the cause of secularism."
