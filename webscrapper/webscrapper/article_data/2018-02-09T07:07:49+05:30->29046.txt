CHENNAI: Finally, motorists can hope for a smooth drive between   and Maduravoyal on   as the road is being relaid after almost a decade.   Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has begun laying a new blacktop road, which is likely to be complete in four months. 

 Except for patchwork the   riddled 4-km stretch has not witnessed any major relaying in the recent past. The development comes in the wake of the NHAI notifying the Madras high court that the authority had earmarked Rs13.37cr for relaying the road in December 2017. 
 
 "Work commenced few days ago," confirmed a NHAI official. The road now under the purview of the NHAI was part of the stalled the Chennai Port-Maduravoyal elevated road project. Mired in controversy the   government in 2011 shelved the project. It is now being revived after the state government expressed its willingness to work with NHAI. 
 
 The stalling of the project had an impact on the maintenance of the road as well, which was not relaid for more than a decade said   coordination committee chairman S Yuvaraj. 
 
 "Since the road is under the control of NHAI, the state government cannot relay it. But for annual patchwork when VIPs would take that route, commuters would have to navigate the poorly maintained road for years. Frequent accidents have occurred on the stretch and it continues to be a nightmare for road users," he said.
