NOIDA: Nearly 25,000 residents of   village in Sector 49 are set to get better power supply from June this year as the Noida power department has decided to replace damaged cables used to transmit electricity across 20km.

 Officials said the ABC (aerial bundle cables) would be replaced by May-end. The decision followed repeated complaints by villagers about long power cuts.
 
 “There are frequent outages in Barola village and neighbouring colonies as the cables in this area are more than 10 years old. Faults in electric lines are a regular phenomenon here. We have been requesting that these   be replaced for long,” said  , a resident of Barola.
 
 Rakesh Kumar Rana, the superintending engineer of PVVNL (division 1 and 5), said work on replacing the power cables would begin next week. “The electric cables in Barola village have been damaged because of overloading over a period of time. The work is expected to complete by May-end. After that, Barola and its neighbouring colonies/areas will get stable, interrupted supply,” said Rana.
