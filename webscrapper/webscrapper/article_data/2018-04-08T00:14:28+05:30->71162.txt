 Moustapha, known for his black and white photography, adopts a documentary style to capture the transient moments by using several layers of reflections on the subjects to convey their strong emotions.
 
 Among the   works exhibited, he rated the   of car window reflection (in pic) as his best work. “It is the best image so far. We need to wait for the right moment to capture. This was captured in   car exhibition on the Beach Road here,” he said.
