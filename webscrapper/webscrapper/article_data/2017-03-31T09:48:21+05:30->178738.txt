Taps were left open at different locations, to observe if members of the public would shut them and prevent   from being wasted. Those behind the campaign observed that residents of the city have a fairly high level of civic consciousness and would shut taps off.

 Small tokens of appreciation were given to over 10 people from each of the different sites who rushed to shut off the taps and prevent water from flowing needlessly. Some people arrived at the open taps to drink water, and were informed that it was not suitable for drinking.
 
 The event was held soon after   on March 22.
