 MP   Kalvakuntla’s campaign appealing to all women in the country to gift a helmet to their brothers while tying rakhi this   has got a big thumbs up from social media users. 

 Speaking to Hyderabad Times about why she chose to kickstart the campaign,   on her brother, KTR’s birthday (July 24), she says, “I was thinking about what to gift my brother when the idea of the campaign struck me. A party worker, Venkat, had suggested that we launch the campaign last year itself, but we felt the timing wasn’t right. With Rakshabandhan around the corner, the timing was perfect to kick off the initiative and make a difference.” 
 
 Stressing on the importance of spreading awareness about helmets, she says, “It is the need of the hour to safeguard our brothers. Almost 400 two-wheeler drivers die in road accidents across the country everyday. The numbers of deaths in two-wheeler accidents is much higher than casualties in terrorist attacks.”
 
 While feminists have hailed the campaign for rewriting the tradition of brothers gifting their sisters on Rakhi, Kavitha says the campaign isn’t restricted just to brothers. “While I, as a sister, care for my brother, the number of women riding two wheelers is increasing by the day, so it applies to women as well,” says Kavita, adding, “In any case, who says sisters can’t be protectors too? It is our collective responsibility to spread awareness. We will conduct awareness campaigns in colleges and at traffic signals too in the coming days.”
