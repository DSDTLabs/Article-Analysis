AHMEDABAD: Ayub Shaikh (name changed), a resident of Fatewadi, was getting anxious about the return of Amina (name changed), his seven-year-old daughter on March 27. His wife and he decided to go to the home of another girl who would be coming home in the same  , near their home. They were in a hurry to go to the market with their daughter.

 They came across their daughter’s school van on the road and on approaching the vehicle were horrified to find Mohammad Afzal Pathan, 55, a resident of Rajivnagar, Makarba, molesting their daughter in the back of the van. Pathan was caught red-handed and was handed over to   police. An FIR was filed on March 30.
 
 “Ayub lives with his wife and two daughters. His older daughter, Amina, is in class II at a Fatehwadi school. She had been going to school with fellow students in Pathan’s van for nine months. Amina would later tell her parents that the   had been going on since school opened after the Diwali vacation. She and another seven-year-old girl who lived near their residence, the two last girls to be dropped, had been victims of the abuse,” said a Sarkhej police official.
 
 The chance discovery by her parents brought the abuse to light. Why did the girls not report it? Investigators said Pathan had made various threats to the girls, including that he would kill them, if they told anyone about the matter. The girls thus did not gather the strength to speak out.
 
 V G Patel, ACP M Division, told TOI that Pathan, 55, is married and a father of three. His elder son is 18 years old. “He and the girls were sent for medical examinations to gather evidence in the case registered under sections of the   and POCSO. We have not found a criminal record but are still in the process of questioning him,” he said.
