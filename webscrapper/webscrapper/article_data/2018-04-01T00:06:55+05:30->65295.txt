New Delhi: Three crooks from a  , who stole valuables from cars, fell in Delhi Police’s net on Saturday.

 On a tip-off that the gang members were spotted at Connaught Place cheating people, police laid a trap to catch them. A policeman posed as a victim left his car door unlocked to lure the accused, and as soon as one of them entered the car, the cop locked him in.
 
 DCP (New Delhi) Madhur Verma said the constables Ravinder and Pradeep were tipped off about the presence of the gang near the Inner Circle by a guard who spotted three suspicious men near a vehicle. Police had earlier informed the guards about the gang and were asked to stay alert.
 
 Police said one of the accused used to position himself behind a car while the other stood in front. The third member used to leave Rs 10 notes around the car and distract particular drivers they targeted. Once the driver use to step out, the man standing behind used to enter the car and escape with bags. However, on Saturday, the policeman managed to lock the accused inside and arrested the rest who were identified as Bhaskar Kadir and M Akilan.
 
 “We found that the gang was active around Palika Bazar and had cheated several people,” said DCP Verma.
 
 Police said the parking staff and street vendors were informed about the gang. The beat staffers had directed them to stay alert after several cases against the thak thak gang were reported in the past few days.
