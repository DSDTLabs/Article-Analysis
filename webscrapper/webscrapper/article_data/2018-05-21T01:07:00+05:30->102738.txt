Tuticorin: A crack has developed among the people leading the anti-Sterlite protest in Tuticorin in connection with the picketing of the district collectorate on Tuesday (May 22), which will be the 100th day since the protests began at Kumarattiyapuram near Sterlite’s copper smelter unit. As the plant has not been permanently closed, protesters said they would picket the collectorate on Tuesday. On Sunday, a section of the representatives of the protests took part in a meeting with the district collector and superintendent of police. After the peace meeting they announced that the picketing has been dropped and that the protesters would protest at a school ground. Following this, another section of leaders passed a resolution that those who took part in the meeting have been removed by the people’s movement seeking ban on Sterlite. They accused them of taking a decision with officials at the meeting without consulting other protesters. They also added that the mass protest planned on May 22 will be organised as decided earlier.
