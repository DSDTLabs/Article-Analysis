KOCHI: Around 2% of people above 40 years of age are presenting themselves with various stages of   in the state,   have said. As part of the  , eye specialists across the state are asking people to screen for glaucoma whenever they go for an  .

 “Ideally, it is mandatory that doctors check the eye pressure when patients come for changing their glasses. But people are going to the optical shops and getting their eyes tested there. In such places, this pressure test is not done. Invariably, this could lead to a condition for primary glaucoma,” said  , medical superintendent & head, cataract and glaucoma, Giridhar Eye Institute. Glaucoma is a disease that damages your eye’s optic nerve. It usually happens when fluid builds up in the front part of your eye. “It causes vision loss if left untreated. Early detection means early treatment and preventing the damage to the nerve,” he said. 
  
 
 
 This happens when fluid inside the eye does not drain properly. It leads to increase of pressure in the eye, called the intraocular pressure (IOP) and this increased pressure can damage eyesight.
 
 “During this week, ophthalmologists in the state organize awareness programmes and conduct eye camps to detect this disease which is the third leading cause of blindness in India. Population-based studies report a prevalence between 2 to 13%. More than 90% of cases of glaucoma in the country remain undetected,” Dr Saikumar said.
 
 Since this has a genetic link too, families of patients with glaucoma are also screened. “There is no clear evidence of what causes glaucoma. Once the nerve begins to get damaged, we try to contain the damage or prevent deterioration. Of course, it means that the vision gets narrowed,” said Dr Sujatha N, additional professor of ophthalmology, Thrissur medical college.
