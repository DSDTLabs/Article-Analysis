Ananda Krishnan, who gave us the hard-hitting movie   last year, will begin shooting his next film from Friday. For the latest venture,   will be teaming up with Thegidi actor  . Talking about the movie, the director says, 'Just like Metro, this one will also be a serious crime story. Though we will be starting the shoot on Friday, this schedule will only be for two to three days. The main shoot will begin in March.' 
Ask him about Ashok's role and he says, 'Ashok will be seen in three different looks as the story revolves around his character and the three different stages of his life ' from childhood to old age.' 
 He adds that the team hasn't decided on the heroine yet and they are looking for a strong performer.
