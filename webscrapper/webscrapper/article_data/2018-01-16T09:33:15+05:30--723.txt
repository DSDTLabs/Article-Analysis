JAISALMER:   was contributing immensely to securing the   of the nation and western Rajasthan will soon become the ‘shakti peeth’ of India in the energy sector, said   on Monday.

 He was inspecting the Focus Energy Gas Field and gas exploration works going on at Langtala near Indo-Pak border in Jaisalmer.
 
 ONGC is studying the flow area of Saraswati River in Haryana and will help in augmenting water resources in water scarce Rajasthan while conducting oil and gas exploration, he said.
 
 Western Rajasthan has huge scope for energy and become an energy hub and an action plan is being drafted now. In an exclusive interview to TOI,   said the area from Jaisalmer to Barmer was becoming a new power centre with huge reserves of oil and gas and production of lignite, cold methane gas, wind energy, solar energy, etc.
 
 This area can meet the energy needs of many parts of the country. Till now, the expectations of the people have not been fulfilled, but in the coming days, the oil and gas exploration works as well as mass production of solar and wind energy would gain momentum.
 
 Along with oil and gas exploration works, the tourism and industrial sectors would also grow and create employment opportunities for youth.
 
 He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi would write a new chapter of development in Barmer on Monday by inaugurating the work on refinery.
 
 At present, the Barmer area produces 1.75 lakh barrels of oil. After the new 9-million-tonne refinery begins operations, this would increase to 2.5 MMT. The modern refinery will also refine oil from other states. He said there were huge reserves of water in Jaisalmer and Barmer desert areas and ONGC would help in finding these reserves. Although, ONGC had started project Saraswati to search for water a few years ago, it was stopped in the middle. But it would restart the project again. 
 
 At present, ONGC is playing an important role in searching for the flow area of extinct Saraswati River in Haryana.
