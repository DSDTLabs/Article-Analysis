NEW DELHI: In the wake of a major crackdown on Afghan and Pak-based drug cartels pumping   into India, smugglers are increasingly resorting to procuring it from insurgency-affected areas in   and supplying them to Delhi and the rest of north India.

 The special cell recently seized 5 kg heroin worth around Rs 20 crore from three traffickers. According to DCP (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav, this cartel had link with areas in Manipur and West Bengal where opium is cultivated illegally and processed into its pure form. 
 
 Several mobile handsets and SIM cards used in the drug trafficking were found on Ram Nath (26),   (29) and Parvez Khan (64), all belonging to Badayun in UP, Yadav added.
 
 Three months ago, the cell had received a tip-off about the cartel members travelling in a Bolero (UP-25BN 2108). As sources were deployed at various locations in West Bengal, Manipur and UP, the car was flagged down on the Barwala-Prahladpur stretch in outer Delhi after an informer identified it and four kg heroin were found from its cavities. 
 
 Its two occupants, Ram and Singh, tried to escape but were chased and caught, said Yadav. The teams were then sent to Bareilly and Badaun in search of the people named by the arrested duo. 
 
 On early Sunday, the third suspect, Parvez Khan, was arrested from Badayun with 1 kg heroin. Khan said he had links with several suppliers in Manipur who gave him heroin at a cheap rate and he sold it off to Delhi peddlers at double the price.
 
 Ram said he used to visit areas like Malda-Farraka in West Bengal and Imphal in Manipur to procure processed as well as crude heroin from two suppliers, Khan and Nizam, who had links with two rebel commanders. The police are also looking for another supplier, Alok.
