Nagpur: Ecotourism will see a boost after the completion of Gorewada International Zoo which is likely to be completed in the next 6 years, said Umesh Agrawal, newly appointed principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) for wildlife on Saturday. 

 Agrawal, a 1983 IFS batch officer, took charge of the post from   on Saturday. He was previously working as managing director of Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM). 
 
 In a interaction session held at Press Club, Civil Lines, Agrawal said, “There will be tiger, bear, herbivores and night safaris, bioparks and many more things to watch out for. There are many organizations which are against the safaris as it has a negative impact on wild animals. But if we want people to be compassionate about jungles, such safaris are important.” 
 
 Bhagwan, who served the forest department for 37 years, said, “I have been closely associated with Nagpur and it holds a special place in my heart. I got an opportunity to work in tribal, wildlife and tiger projects. It has been a great journey.” 
 
 On cutting down of forests in the name of development, Agrawal said, “Both nature and development, are important; but if we keep a regular check on productivity of the area, I feel we can manage both fairly well.” 
 
 Apart from the new ventures that Agrawal plans to launch, his primary focus would be on the 50 crore tree plantation mission set by Maharashtra forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar.
