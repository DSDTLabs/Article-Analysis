Thane: The city police are on the lookout for a conman from   for duping two   from   and pocketing over Rs 1 lakh on false promise of securing jobs for their sons in the Indian Army.

 Police said the victims, Tejasvi Palande and Shobha Kadam, claimed to have paid Rs 1.15 lakh to one  , a resident of Belgaum for secure jobs for their sons. “Palande and Kadam paid the entire amount to the conman without bothering to verify his credentials.

 “After receiving the funds, Patil directed the victims’ sons to reach Lucknow for an interview at the army institute. He fabricated documents of a non-existing army institute situated somewhere in Lucknow. When the youths reached the place they realized the con and all attempts to contact Patil proved futile,” added a cop. 
 
 The duo then registered an offence with the Kalwa police station. A preliminary probe revealed that Patil’s bank account no longer operational. However, the police are trying to track Patil with the help of the cyber cell and description given by the two complainants.
