MUMBAI: The  , led by  , is at the receiving end for the government's inept handling of the  .

 It was expected of the department to swing into action after a doctor in Dhule was beaten up by a patient's relatives. Despite murmurs on the ground, the department's response was dismal. It woke up only after a doctor attached to a BMC-run hospital was assaulted by the relatives of a patient. In the last 15 days, more than a dozen doctors have been physically attacked or abused by patients' relatives.
 
 Aformer dean said that after the Sion hospital episode, medical education secretary Rajgopal Deora and J J Hospital dean T P Lahane did make efforts to persuade the agitating doctors, but did not succeed.
 
 Deora and Lahane were followed by the medical education minister, while chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had a marathon meeting with agitating doctors on Thursday. It was only towards the very end of the day that the efforts seemed to bear fruit. The CM assured that security guards will be deployed at all hospitals across the state, and six constables and a police sub-inspector will be deployed with immediate effect. “Regular guards will be deployed within a week.So, we expect doctors to resume duties,“ Mahajan told TOI.
 
 Aformer dean said there was lack of seriousness on providing security to doctors and implementation of legislation for the protection of doctors. “The government assures security only when resident doctors resort to strike. Once a  , the government is not serious about the demands anymore.“
