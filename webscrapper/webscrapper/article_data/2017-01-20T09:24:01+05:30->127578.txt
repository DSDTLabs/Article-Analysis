INDORE: A man was booked for making social media posts describing his wife as a prostitute and her father as her pimp. 

 He posted the objectionable material on social networking sites after his dowry demands were not met with.
 
 A complaint in this regard was lodged by the victim at Gautampura police station in the city.
 
 Her father   claimed that he had married his 19-year-old daughter to 23-year-old Vinod Vishwakarma, a resident of   area in Ujjain, a few months ago.
 
 They had also given whatever Vinod and his family members demanded from them and also organised the entire wedding.
 
 After a few weeks however, the girl's in-laws started harassing her and also thrashed her on several occasions demanding dowry from her.
 
 The girl, while speaking to the police, also claimed that her husband had taken her to a tantrik and did some black magic to 'gain control of her mind'.
 
 After being harassed physically and mentally to a great extent, the girl somehow managed to contact her father and narrated the entire tale to him.
 
 Satish brought her back home. After a few days, Satish got a call from his friend Anand Taak, who claimed that his son-in-law had made an objectionable post about them on social networking sites and also made it go viral on WhatsApp.
 
 Satish was shocked after reading the letter in which it was mentioned that his daughter had more than four husbands and he used to sell his daughter to different people and make money out of it.
 
 Following this, the family members decided to approach police in the matter.
 
 "A case under all relevant sections of dowry harassment and   has been registered against the accused and he has been arrested," said Hitendra Rathod, Gautampura police station in-charge while speaking to media persons here on Thursday.
