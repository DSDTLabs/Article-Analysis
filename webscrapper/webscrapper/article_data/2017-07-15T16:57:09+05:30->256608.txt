Amidst all the hullabaloo surrounding  's arrest, it seems the actor is actually cracking jokes in jail, true to the comedian inside him! Reports say that the policemen in the jail are laughing their asses off, at some of his one-liners. One of them reportedly goes like this, 'I asked God to give me rest for ten days but he heard 'give me arrest for ten days'. 

 At the same time, the police also say that Dileep is no longer co-perating with the investigation. He has gone back to his original stance that he doesn't know Pulsar suni, they say. The absconding of Dileep's manager   has raised suspicion, and also made impossible, a cross-questioning of the two.
 
 Also, Dileep should not be given any special consideration because he is a film star, the policemen have been told. It is also being said that he was reprimanded by the magistrate for cracking jokes.
