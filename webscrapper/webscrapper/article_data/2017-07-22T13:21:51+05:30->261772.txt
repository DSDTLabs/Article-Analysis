KOHIMA: The youth wing of the Nagaland People's Front (NPF) on Friday organized a 'beef feast' in front of the party headquarters in Kohima to celebrate the end of its ties with the  . The two parties, allies since 1997, parted ways on July 18 after governor PB   dismissed the government led by Shurhozelie Liezietsu. Angry with what the party described as Acharya's 'role' in precipitating the crisis in the state, the organizers of the 'feast' also sent him an invite. 

 Speaking to the media, NPF working president   said the feast had been organized to needle BJP that had made its strictures against the slaughter of cows quite clear. He said Nagas ate beef and would continue to do so.
 
 NPF youth president   added that three cows donated by a party leader had been slaughtered to prepare the dishes for the 'feast'. Around 500 people had turned up, he said.
 
 In a press statement, the party's youth wing stated, "To celebrate your (Acharya's) latest political coup, and to mark the severance of ties with your political party, we are organizing a beef feast. You know Nagas are voracious meat-eaters and we would like to take this opportunity to invite you to cancel some of your not-so-official engagements in political scheming and join us for dinner at the NPF headquarters in Kohima."
