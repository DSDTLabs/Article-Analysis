New Delhi: The   University admission committee has decided to open the web portal for registration to Non Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB). Those female applicants who are residents of Delhi and had selected BA (Programme) and BCom (Programme) as their subjects during registration on the DU web portal in May, will be eligible to apply to NCWEB.

 According to officials, this decision has been taken in light of several requests from students who were not able to make it past the cutoffs in these courses in most colleges. Even after the fourth cutoff list, those colleges that still have the two programmes available continue to place them at high cutoffs.
 
 According to Anju Gupta, the officiating director of NCWEB, the portal will be reopened for admission, which will be done on the basis of its third cutoff list released on Wednesday. The portal will remain open till the end of admission at NCWEB. “This move is especially useful to those who did not choose NCWEB at the time of registration, but would like that option now,” she said. She said around 6,700 girl applicants are set to benefit from it.
 
 The NCWEB only offers BA (P) and BCom (P) courses, and holds classes at centres on Saturdays and Sundays. Usually students preparing for competitive exams or undergoing professional training courses take this option.
 
 As per the third cutoff list, the lowest cutoff was at   for BA (P) was 68, while the highest was 86 at Miranda House. For BCom (P), the lowest was also at   while the highest was at Miranda House at 86.
