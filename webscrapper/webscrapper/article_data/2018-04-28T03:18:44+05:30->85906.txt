NEW DELHI: AAP on Friday sacked Amit  , general secretary of its national legal cell, for representing the party's founding member Kumar  , who has virtually been ostracised from the party for his stance against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. 

 Yadav was elevated to the post of general secretary early this year after handling key legal assignments for the party. He had joined AAP in 2012 following the anti-corruption movement. "He has been removed for going against the party's ideology, which entails disassociation from anybody who is against the party," said Madan Lal, AAP's legal cell convener. Prior to his removal, the party had sought to know Yadav's stand on the issue. But he refused to budge.
 
 "I helped Vishwas as a professional lawyer, and that did not mean that I was against the party. The party does not pay me. Law is my profession," Yadav said. Vishwas was recently sacked as the in-charge of AAP's   unit. On Thursday, while expressing relief over acquittal in a case related to the AAP's assembly election campaign, he had taken an indirect dig at Kejriwal. "Dozens of other political cases going on. Cowards left the battle filed but let the fight and the fire continue (sic)," he tweeted, possibly referring to Kejriwal's apology to Union finance minister Arun Jaitley in a defamation case. 
 
 Vishwas, who is an accused in the same case, has refused to apologise. A rift had emerged between Vishwas and Kejriwal during the   assembly elections. The relationship deteriorated further when Vishwas took a line that was different from AAP's stand on alleged EVM tampering during Delhi civic polls in 2017. Things virtually came to a breaking point when AAP preferred two outsiders over Vishwas as nominees for   elections in early 2018. AAP has accused Vishwas of trying to "topple" its government, while the latter has maintained that he was punished for speaking the truth.
