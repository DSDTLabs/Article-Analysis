 My father died when I was still in school and I could not study after Class XII. After I got married, I worked at many jewellery manufacturing units, but the lack of proper education was always a drawback. My husband told me to take up studies in whichever field I want to and I chose healthcare. About two years ago, I took up a private nursing course. 
 
 The night shift, however, disrupted my family life. Late last year, I read about a dialysis technicianâ€™s course in a   community newsletter. The course fee was a bit steep at Rs 40,000 but I applied for a loan from our community. I was interviewed and asked questions like why I was taking up studies so late in life. The interviewers told me they had approved my loan because never before had a 37-year-old woman applied for a study loan. Once I finish this diploma, I can get a job in any hospital and a salary of up to Rs 20,000 a month.
