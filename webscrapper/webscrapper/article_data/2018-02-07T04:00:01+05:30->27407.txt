MUMBAI: The   sought to know from the   (VVMC) about the grounds on which its officials had suspended the licences of meat sellers in Nalasopara suspected to have sold “beef”.

 On December 15, 2017, 550 kg of “beef” was seized in the vicinity of these shops.
 
 On January 22, the assistant municipal commissioner wrote to the police, stating that despite suspension of licences, these shops were continuing business and the police must register offences against them. The petitioners denied that they were connected with the illegal sale of beef. Their advocate Drupad Patil said, “We have no role in it.’’ Senior advocate Atul Damle, representing the VVMC, said licence conditions were violated and therefore the municipal commissioner exercised his powers under the   Municipal Corporations Act. The judges questioned on what basis the VMMC had suspended their licences. “Tell us what basis you go and suspend licences? Your notice has no allegation that they were selling beef, ’’ said Justice Oka. The judges also asked if “mere suspicion” is a valid ground to suspend licences when there was no apparent breach of licence conditions. 
 
 In their order, the judges said there is no allegation that the meat seized belonged to the petitioners or that they were found selling it. It was also not alleged that licence conditions were breached. The petitioners on December 19, 2017, had written to VVMC that they have never sold beef in their respective shops and have abided by the licence conditions, the judges said. They noted that the petitioners had also produced receipts for their purchases from the Thane abattoir. “We find the notice is ex-facie illegal,’’ said the judges, and posted the matter for final disposal on March 14.
