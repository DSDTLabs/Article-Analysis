CHANDIGARH: Union housing and urban affairs minister   on Saturday asked the cash-strapped municipal corporation (MC) to improve its   to triple-A from a poor triple-B.

 A private company, Infomerics, had rated the civic body on its financial status and worth.
 
 Puri was in the city to review the progress of the Centre’s flagship schemes — AMRUT, Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart Cities Mission, Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana and Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission — in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh.
 
 By improving the credit rating to triple-A ranking, the MC can issue bonds to attract people, but this can be done only with a sound financial status. Bengaluru and Ahmedabad civic bodies have issued bonds in the past.
 
 “Credit rating tells whether an organisation is   or not. To reach triple-A position, the MC will have to take bold steps to strengthen its financial status, like enhancing water tariff, tax charges and other public user charges,” said a senior officer who attended the review meeting.
 
 However, municipal councillors have in the past rejected agenda items to increase water tariff and property tax. Though the MC owns some properties in the city, in prominent locations like Sector 17 too, but it has failed to auction them or give them out on rent due to high rates.
 
 “Fish Market and booths in Sector 17, where crores of rupees have been invested, lie defunct. There is a dire need to either sell or rent out such properties,” sources said.
