Thiruvananthapuram: The government suspended former MD of Malabar Cements  , who is facing a vigilance probe. Chief minister  , on Monday, issued an order to suspend the official from public sector firm restructuring and internal audit board (RIAB). The secretary of RIAB had taken a compulsory leave after he was arrested by the vigilance in the graft case. 

 The chief minister's decision comes despite chief secretary  , law secretary BG Harindranath and additional chief secretary Paul Antony's recommendation that there is nothing against Padmakumar that can nail him in a court of law on the basis of the vigilance report that was submitted to the government.
 
 The law secretary, who is also a district judge, had made sharp remarks in the file against Padmakumar. He had said that the case was unfounded and VACB had violated the guidelines of the Supreme Court that should be followed by the police while arresting a person. But, Vijayan had justified the arrest of Padmakumar and had turned down the proposal for reinstating the officer as the managing director of the company, from which he was removed following the vigilance case.
