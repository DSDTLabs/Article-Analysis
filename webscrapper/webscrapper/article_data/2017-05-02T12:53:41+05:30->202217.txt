 might not have delivered major hits since his debut, but his fan following has definitely gone up the ladder. Yes, his acting skills need more polishing which he accepts as well (and we love him for that!), but he is one actor among the newbies whose action stunts are totally incomparable.
 
 One such movie of Tiger that did manage to crack some numbers at the box-office was ‘Baaghi’. He was appreciated for his unbelievable stunts and so, the movie will soon have a sequel. This time Tiger looks bulkier and beefed up, Rambo-like to be more precise.

 However, the movie will release only next year, which was quite a bummer for the fans and the teaser poster looks astonishing. 
 
 Just like ‘Baaghi’, the sequel will be totally action-packed with a backdrop of a love story. The actress hasn’t been revealed yet, though the makers have apparently chosen the leading lady and it’s not Shraddha Kapoor. 
 
 Tiger is currently busy with ‘Munna Micheal’ which also has Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Ronit Roy in the movie.
