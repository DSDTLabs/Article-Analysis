 Well, for somebody like Tejaswi, who’s a self confessed “social media addict”, the prospect of living without her smart phone is going to be her biggest challenge. “She’s very active on social media and posts pictures and videos every other day. So, to stay away from her phone is going to be a task for her. Besides, the idea of living with people she doesn’t know, cooking her own food, washing her clothes and doing everything by 
 herself is something she is kicked about,” says the source. 
 
 The spunky actress is known for her bubbly onscreen persona, but will she be able to manage to stay her cheerful self in the house? “Well,   hopes to just be herself. People have seen her acting, but on this show, the audience will get to see how she is in real life. she’s not going to take it lying down if anybody messes with her; she will give it back to them.”
