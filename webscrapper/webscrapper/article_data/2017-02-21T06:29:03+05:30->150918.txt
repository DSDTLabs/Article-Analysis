MUMBAI: A special court last week rejected incarcerated MLA  's plea to attend the state budget session. Accepting the prosecution's submission that he could not exercise his right to personal liberty while being in custody, the court held that Kadam “could not claim the status higher than that of ordinary citizen as his custody is in accordance with established criminal law“.

 In 2015, NCP MLA Kadam was arrested in Pune for his alleged involvement in a multi-crore scam in the Lokshahir Annabhau Sathe Development Corporation (LASDC), of which he is a former chairman.
 
 While rejecting the plea, the court took into consideration a Delhi high court judgment that denied permission to a jailed member of   who wanted to attend the Lok Sabha. Kadam is in judicial cus tody and sought permission to attend the budget session from March 6 to April 7. During the course of arguments, he submitted that during the budget session he wanted to put forth the grievances from his constituency .
 
 The prosecution objected to the plea, contending that Kadam's arrest and judicial custody was in accordance with established cri minal law and he could not exerci se the right of personal liberty. It said that it was neither a constitutional nor a fundamental right of the MLA to attend the budget session.
 
 Kadam is accused of transferring the money from the LASDC account to those of his associates' companies, and they had allegedly purchased properties in his name. He had allegedly used around Rs 100 crore to purchase a property on   with money meant to help the   community.
