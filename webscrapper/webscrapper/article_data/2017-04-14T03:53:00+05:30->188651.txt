PANAJI: Former Congress MLA   Rane vowed to work under the guidance of chief minister  , following his swearing-in on Wednesday. 

 When pointed out that he was, in the past, very critical of some of the BJP-led government’s departments, including health, Rane said Parrikar was in Delhi at the time, thereby making it difficult for him to thrash out matters. “But now, if I want any issue redressed, I will approach him,” Rane said.
 
 The erstwhile Valpoi legislator said he didn’t know what portfolio he would be given, and merely stated that portfolio allotment was the chief minister’s prerogative.
 
 “I will study and analyze whatever portfolio I am given. It might take a week,” Rane said. 
 
 He added that he was aware of Parrikar’s style of functioning from his experience as chairman of the Goa Tourism Development Corporation a few years ago.
 
  “I will give my best. The chief minister will be proud to have me in the cabinet,” Rane said. tnn
