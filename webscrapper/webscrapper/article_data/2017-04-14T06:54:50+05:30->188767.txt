KOLKATA: There will be an elaborate   on Friday morning at   before the tunnel boring machine (TBM) for the East-West   corridor enters its most challenging part — at a depth of a 10-storeyed building below the surface of the   — possibly on Saturday.

 “This is the most challenging part of our work. This is why we will be holding a puja. All the engineers will be attending it. The machine will face some unique challenges, like Kolkata’s soft ground condition and densely populated urban environment. It requires delicate balancing of TBMs and well-engineered tunnelling operations. The TBM will require three more months to reach the east bank of the river,” said an engineer. 
 
 “Imagine the technological precision and expertise required for a project that makes it possible for us to travel under the Hooghly in a state-of the-art Metro line. The Eurostar (connecting Paris and London) offers an apt analogy for the level of technology harnessed by KMRC,” he added. 
 
 The Howrah-side tunnels have a curve of 228m radius, which the engineers have named ”Kardashian curve”. The deep tunnel curve is meant to match the road width above, said a KMRC officer. As the TBM moves forward, it will keep fitting the pre-fabricated tunnel components. The mud and silt will be dumped on a ground near Maidan, said another engineer.
 
 At Howrah Maidan, the roof of the tunnels are at a depth of 11m from the ground level. The first boring machine reached a depth of 24m (ground to roof) near Howrah station. As it will progress towards the river, it will dig further down till 30m. The Mahakaran (Writers’ Buildings) and Esplanade stations will be 27m under ground. The north-south corridor runs at an average of 16m to 17m under ground.
 
 Unlike the north-south corridor, which has a single tunnel, the   will have interlinked stretches every 250m. Since it isn’t feasible to have interlinked stretches along the Hooghly river bed, two escape shafts are being built at either end of the route.
