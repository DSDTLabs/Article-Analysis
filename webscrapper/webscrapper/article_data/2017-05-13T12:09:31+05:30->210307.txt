KOLHAPUR: The officials of   (KMC), corporators and other public representatives will be visiting various locations along the on-going   on Tuesday. 

 The decision was taken in the meeting held between Mayor Hasian  , civic authorities and workers of Shiv Sena. The work at various sites has not resumed after Shiv Sena stalled it on Wednesday. The civic administration had taken a stand that the work will resume after consensus with all the stakeholders. 
 
 Sanjay Pawar, Shiv Sena leader, said, “Allegations are being made over the ambitious project. We are only demanding an enquiry into the alleged irregularities in clearing the bills of smaller costs. We will not allow the work to resume till the state government assures about the enquiry and action against those responsible.”
 
 The Shiv Sena workers unanimously demanded highest-level enquiry of the alleged irregularities. The issue came after the corporators alleged that the civic administration cleared the bills worth Rs 2.2 crore even after the total cost of the work did not cross Rs 25 lakh. The municipal commissioner   cleared the position of the civic administration and assured the delegation that such mistakes will not be repeated during the completion of the Rs 488 crore project work. At present around Rs 180 crore has been spent on the project.
 
 Faras said, “We want the work to continue. I will not tolerate any wrongdoing in the project as it is concerned with all the citizens. We will visit all sites of the project on Tuesday and inspect the actual condition of the work.”
 
 Chaudhari said that he will initiate the process to scrutinise each work component of the project so as to avoid mistake in future. The total detailed project report (DPR) will be scanned to correct false estimates.
