PANAJI: Citing senior   leader Wilfred Mesquita’s decision to not campaign for his party for the upcoming state assembly election, the   on Wednesday attacked defence minister   for harbouring corrupt leaders in his ranks.

 “Wilfred Mesquita has said that he supports Prime Minister   in his fight against corruption, but the corruption in Goa has doubled during the BJP’s reign. Due to this, he won’t be campaigning for his own party. We congratulate Mesquita for openly accepting that corruption exists in the BJP,” party spokesperson Durgadas Kamat said, adding that the decision validates the fight of GFP’s mentor MLA Vijai Sardesai, against corruption by the state government.
