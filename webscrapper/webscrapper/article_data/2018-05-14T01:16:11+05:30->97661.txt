NEW DELHI: Rejecting the charge that he was trying to delay   CCTV project,   on Sunday wrote a   to  , stating that it was “unfortunate” that people were being “misled” on the issue “repeatedly and deliberately”. 

 The letter came a day ahead of the proposed march of AAP ministers and MLAs to LG’s residence over the issue. Baijal had set up a committee to prepare a common framework for installation, operation and monitoring of CCTV cameras in the capital, following which PWD minister Satyendar Jain had lashed out at him, calling the move “illegal and unconstitutional”. 
 
 In his letter, Baijal strongly defended his decision. “To use CCTV cameras effectively for law enforcement, prevention of crime and investigation, the regulatory framework is needed. That is why the committee was set up,” he said, adding that his order nowhere asked for the work to be stalled. Baijal said the CM would agree with him on the need to put in place a framework to monitor the working of CCTV cameras.
 
 LG accused AAP government of “sidetracking the core issue of women safety”. He claimed that no proposal relating to the award of the work for installation of CCTV cameras had been received by his office and that the matter was pending with the government only. 
 
 He claimed that the government had been talking about installation of CCTV cameras for three years without much progress. “More than 2 lakh cameras have already been installed in the city by Delhi Police, DMRC, DDA, local bodies, market associations and RWAs. But these cameras are being used without a regulatory framework and standard operating procedure. Uncontrolled and unregulated mushrooming of CCTV cameras does not lead to any effective outcome for security and law enforcement and it may encroach upon the privacy of individuals,” he said.
