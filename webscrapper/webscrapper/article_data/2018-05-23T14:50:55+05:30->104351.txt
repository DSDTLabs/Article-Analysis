RAJKOT: The cattle breeders from Banni region in   that is spread across talukas like Rapar, Abdasa and Naliya are facing sever fodder crisis. They have turned to social media for seeking donation of cattle feed and fodder for their cows and have posted messages seeking donations from several WhatApp groups.

 
 There are more than 700 cows with cattle breeders in Adesar and nearby villages. Usually, they migrate with the animals before summer sets in — February or March — and return to their villages after first rain. 
 
 However, this year, they preferred to stay in their villages as the region received good rain last year. They expected that there will be plenty of grass before the next monsoon. But since past few weeks, the cattle breeders are facing severe fodder crisis for their cows. 
 
 Jogabhai Rabari, a cattle breeder from Adesar, said, “We have urged donors to provide us grass and fodder as our cows are starving.” 
 
 Another cow breeder   said, “There was not enough food for cows till last month. But since last few days there is not enough fodder for the cows. We feel sorry for the cows.”
 
 There are other villages facing similar situation as there is no network of   water pipeline.
 
 Vikramsinh Jadeja, an animal rights activist from Rajkot, said, “Every year, in summer, these cow breeders bring their livestock on the outskirts of Rajkot where people feed them grass. But this year, it was not possible to provide enough fodder. So, we have urged donors online to help us.”
 
 There are 80 cow shelters in Kutch housing nearly 1,00,000 cows and are still waiting for government’s help for fodder. 
 
 A member of the state animal welfare board Rajendra Shah said, “CM Vijay Rupani in a meeting with the people of   cow shelter said that he won’t let any animal die. I have requested Kutch’s cattle breeders to make representation to the government. I have promised to extend all possible help.”
