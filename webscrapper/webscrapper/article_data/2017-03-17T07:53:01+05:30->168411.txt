CHENNAI: A 26-year-old man and two of his friends on Wednesday night hacked to death his father's killer at the   in an apparent act of revenge, police said. 

  Sukumar, 27, a house painter, was standing at the bus stand when three men on a motorcycle surrounded him and fell upon him with   in full public view. 
 
  waiting for buses began to run   even as traffic   managed to nab one of the assailants. The other two sped away on their motorcycle. 
 
 The accused, identified as Tamizh Arasan, told police that in March last year Sukumar and his friends had hacked to death his father  , 45. 
 
  A court sent Tamizh Arasan to jail, while police have launched a hunt to nab his two accomplices. 
 
 Police said that Tamizh Azhagan and Sukumar had been business partners who had fallen out over the issue of sharing the commission in minor real estate deals that they struck in the area. There had been frequent quarrels between the two men and a bitter altercation erupted in February last year. A moth later, Tamizh Azhagan was murdered by a gang led by Sukumar, a senior police officer said
