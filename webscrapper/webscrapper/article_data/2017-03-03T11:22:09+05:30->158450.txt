GUWAHATI: The state government will fly out a day-old baby girl, born with her heart outside the thoracic cavity, to Bengaluru on Friday. The baby, born to Tazmina Khatun, 28, at a dispensary in Dhubri on Wednesday, was diagnosed with a rare congenital heart defect known as ectopia cordis. Tazmina's husband is a daily wage labourer in  .

 A cardiologist at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) said ectopia cordis was a rare abnormality with an estimated prevalence of 5.5 to 7.9 per million live births. Another cardiologist at   said he had never seen such a case in his lifetime. "This is the rarest of rare cases," the doctor said. The decision of sending the infant to Bengaluru was taken after specialists at GMCH could not operate upon her. A team of experts from Narayana Health (formerly  ) in the   capital will now study her case and treat her.
 
 The infant is a beneficiary of the state government's congenital heart defect programme which gives free treatment in Kolkata and Bengaluru to children from weaker sections of society suffering from congenital heart defects. "I will be accompanying the mother and infant to Bengaluru. Special arrangements have been made. The infant will be taken to the airport in an advanced trauma life support ambulance," said Abhijit Sarma, deputy superintendent and state coordinator of the congenital heart defect programme.
