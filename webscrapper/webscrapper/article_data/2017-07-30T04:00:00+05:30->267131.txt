Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has called a meeting of road contractors of the city to ensure that the work on restoration of roads damaged during monsoon is taken up on priority. Four different contractors have been issued notices by the civic body after the surface of roads laid by them got damaged during rains.

 Sources said that at the meeting on Monday, the contractors will be asked to give a time bound action plan for the restoration of damaged roads. Under the tender conditions, the contractors are under obligation to repair the roads if they are damaged within the guarantee period.
 
 The civic body will also be collecting samples of material from the roads that have been washed away. If it comes to light that the work was of inferior quality, action will be taken against the erring contractors.
 
 The civic body has swung into action after it drew flak regarding the condition of the roads in the city. Some roads that were damaged were made within the last couple of years. 
 
 Also, there was no digging for laying any service lines or cables on several roads and yet they developed potholes. In some other cases, roads that were resurfaced only last year have been damaged.
 
 The VMC will also be looking for external expertise to ensure that the quality of roads in the city is improved. Experts will be roped in to look into new technologies that can be adopted to improve the quality of roads. 
 
 VMC commissioner Vinod Rao has already asked prominent citizens and experts in the city to make suggestions in this regard.
 
 The civic body will also be compiling the details of the damaged roads and the expenses that it may have to bear on repairs of those that are older than the guarantee period. 
 
 This will be sent to the state government for possible aid in repairs.
