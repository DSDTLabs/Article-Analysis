NEW DELHI: The   government on Friday assured the   that it would not disrupt supply of   to the national capital till the inter-state dispute on sharing of Yamuna water is resolved by the court. 

 Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for Haryana, told a bench of Justices   and Deepak Gupta that the state government had decided not to alter the amount of water supplied to Delhi and pleaded the court to settle the dispute once and for all as the state was itself witnessing water crisis. 
 
 The bench, however, asked why the dispute was not being addressed by the Upper Yamuna River Board which was constituted to resolve it. The court directed to Board to examine the issue and place its suggestions to the bench by May 14.
 
 “Why the Board is not doing their job? Who are the members of the Board? What are they doing? Why should we do their job?” the bench said and directed the Board to file its response.
 
 A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed amongst the five basin states in 1994 for sharing of the water of Upper Yamuna. Clause 7(iii) of the MoU provides that the allocation of available flows amongst the beneficiary states will be regulated by the Upper Yamuna River Board within the overall framework of the agreement.
 
 The river originates in   glacier in the Himalayas and traverses through Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi till its confluence with Ganga. The stretch of the river from its origin to Okhla near Delhi is called Upper Yamuna. The Board was set up to regulate supply of water from all storages up to and including Okhla barrage.
 
 The court passed the order while hearing a plea filed by DJB accusing Haryana of disobeying the SC’s 1996 order directing the state to release 450 cusecs of Yamuna water daily to Delhi . The Board told the bench that Delhi was facing an acute water crisis owing to shortage in supply by Haryana and sought the court’s intervention.
