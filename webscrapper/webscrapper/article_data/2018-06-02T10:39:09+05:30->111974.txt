KOZHIKODE: As part of a precautionary measure against the   virus infection, Thamarassery diocese has decided to serve Holy Communion in the hand instead of on the tongue.

 In a circular, Thamarassery Bishop Mar Remigiose Inchananiyil, while appreciating the initiatives of the government and health department to curb Nipah, urged the faithful to follow the directions of the authorities to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.
 
 The diocese has also decided to postpone the catechism classes to June 10. Only unavoidable functions and celebrations should be held during this period, the circular added.
