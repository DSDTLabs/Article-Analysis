LUCKNOW: Over 66 lakh students will appear in   examinations - the biggest in Asia - at 8,549   centres on Tuesday under the watchful eyes of UP police's special task force. 

 It is for the first time ever that the state government has roped in STF to check the menace of copying. The move is aimed at cracking down on education mafia, popularly known as 'nakal-mafia', who facilitate mass copying. The exams would be a litmus test for the state government which has adopted a strict stance against cheating and has adopted a number of measures to check irregularities.
 
 With UP Secondary Education Board ( ) declaring 50 of the 75 districts as 'sensitive', maintaining sanctity of the exams is a daunting task for the government. 
 
 On the eve of the exams, education department officials insisted that they are well prepared.
 
 "There are 1,521 'hyper sensitive' and 566 'sensitive' centres. Exams will be held under surveillance of   cameras," said UPSEB secretary  . 
 
 This year, UPSEB has also made mandatory for invigilators to carry their Aadhaar card.
 
 Along with identity card mentioning the invigilator's Aadhaar details, teachers have to bring their Aadhaar card along to duty. The move is aimed to check proxy and fake teachers. In addition, UPSEB has introduced 'numbering' on answer copies. Along with their signature, the students will also have to enter the number mentioned on their answer copy on the attendance roll. 
 
 Chief secretary   has directed officials to ensure that candidates are frisked at the centre's main entrance. 
 
 Section 144 will be imposed in the 100 metre radius of exam centre to prohibit gathering of five or more persons. Two police constables and a sub-inspector will assist each flying squad.
 
 Of the 66.37 lakh total candidates, 36.56 lakh are for class 10 and 29.81 for class 12. The class X exam will be held over a span of 14 days and end on February 22 while class XII exams will end on March 12.
