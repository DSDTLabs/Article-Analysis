NEW DELHI: In a day or two, Aam Aadmi Party ( ) will formally launch its campaign for the upcoming municipal corporation elections.

 With sanitation being its key   issue, AAP has coined a slogan that attacks not just the state of sanitation but also BJP, the ruling party in all the three corporations. “MCD chunav mein jhadu chalao, Dilli se gandagi bhagao”, loosely translated as make the jhadu (broom) win in the corporation elections and chase away  . This will be seen plastered across the   by next week and will be the party’s refrain when it starts campaigning door to door.
 
 “Filth can be interpreted as both garbage and as corruption within the corporation. There is a marked difference between a corporation office and a Delhi government office...and between the staff of MLAs and that of councillors. Our focus in the coming election will be on the last 10 years of BJP’s misrule in the corporations,” said Ashish Talwar, AAP’s Delhi in charge.
 
 The party said that its campaign will be focused on sanitation as a major failure of the corporation that lead to accumulation of filth, resulting in diseases like dengue and chikungunya. “Sanitation is one of the most crucial responsibilities of the corporation and they have failed. The capital sees a spurt in vector-borne diseases every monsoon because of that,” said anofficial.
 
 To address the issue of corruption within the corporation, AAP has also set up a team to research the various “scams” that have taken place. “There is a marked change in the assets of BJP and Congress councillors and the reason that Congress has kept quiet about the mismanagement in the corporation for so long is because it is also complicit in the corruption. Once we have the facts in hand, we will take this matter to each resident and tell them about it,” said another official.
