NEW DELHI: Lieutenant governor Anil  , on Monday, said the government is   a   strategy to deal with the growing   and   in the city. He said while the parking policy can be “notified any time”, options are being explored to designate certain roads for one-way traffic movement and also to levy a charge from vehicle owners for entering some of the congested stretches.

 This is known as congestion charge. Baijal said the two options are “subject of study”. He added, “Where it is going to work, I don’t know,” indicating that rolling out these interventions will take time. He added the proposals are at a very early stage and these have to be absorbed by the community for their success. He did not specify the stretches, which are under consideration.
 
 On December 1, the Lt Governor had held a meeting with traffic police, PWD and municipal bodies. In an official release, his secretariat had spelt out the plans for declaring certain roads for one-way traffic and some others for congestion charge. Baijal had asked Delhi Traffic Police to carry out a study to explore the feasibility of these interventions.
 
 Though Baijal said he cannot speak more about the schemes, he said smart tags can be installed in vehicles under the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) mechanism so that the congestion charges would get automatically deducted from the tag when any vehicle enters the designated roads. Vehicle owners will have the option to recharge the tags as it is done in the case of FASTags used for paying toll on National Highways.
 
 Baijal did not respond to whether only four-wheelers will be subjected to paying such charge and exempt two-wheelers.
