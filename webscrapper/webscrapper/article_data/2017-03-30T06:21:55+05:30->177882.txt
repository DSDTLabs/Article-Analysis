RANCHI: Chief minister   on Wednesday announced the opening of an “akhra” ( ) in every village for purposes of entertainment and competition. Das made this announcement at the   where he had gone to address a gathering on the eve of the tribal festival, Sarhul. 

 “Once these akhras are in place, cultural competitions would be organised and selected candidates would be given an opportunity to participate at the panchayat, block and district levels,” he said, adding that every year a janjatiya sanskritik mela (tribal cultural fair) would be organised at the Morhabadi ground where state-level winners would be felicitated.
 
 Elaborating on the concept of akhras in villages, Das said the culture exposition would would serve two purposes: giving a platform to deserving artists and showcasing the art and culture of the state at the national level. “The world wants to know about tribal culture, lifestyle and food and the festival would attract tourists from all over the world. There are many who want to study and do research on tribal culture,” he said. 
 
 The state government has also decided to focus on research and promote students from within and outside the state. “We have decided to extend maximum help to students who want to take up higher studies and research work. Financial assistance would be provided to the students who want to go to other states for higher education,” he said.
 
 Admitting there is a crunch of manpower in higher education, Das said instructions have been given to the secretary, department of higher education, to fill up the vacancies at the earliest.
 
 The chief minister was welcomed by the vice-chancellor of RU, Ramesh Kumar Pandey, registrar Amar Kumar Choudhary and other senior officials. After gracing a colourful cultural show by tribal students, Das spent some time with ‘mandar’ (drum) players.
