JAIPUR: The residents of colonies situated near   river in Jaipur met   spokesman Pratap Singh   on Tuesday and complained about the problems due to the project that blocked pathway in their areas.

 The state government along with TATA consultancy firm has launched Dravyavati river project to beautify the city and to provide sewerage facility to the residents. However, 7 lakh residents of the area are now facing problems as the roads on both sides have been blocked.
 
 Khacharyawas said, “Rajasthan government and JDA are misusing money of tax payers by investing in this project. There are no rules and regulations of the project and Tata consultancy is taking advantage of it. The government should as soon as possible make a culvert for the people to pass and also construct a road for the comfort of the residents living nearby.”
 
 He further said that the project is not well planned and JDA and the government is trying to throw the city in the dark zone. Khacharyawas announced that on March 29, the Congress workers will go to the colonies and meet the residents and listen to their complaints.
 
 He even said that if no proper culvert is being made, there will be agitation by the Congress along with the residents.
 
 Khacharyawas further alleged that the BJP government has approved a faulty detailed project report (DPR) and it would lead to water crises in the city, which is already in critical zone.
 
 “The riverbed is covered with concrete and it would not allow water to penetrate inside the earth. The government is spending crores of rupees on a project which is not feasible.”
