BAGALKOT: As per the Hindu calendar, today is Badami Amavasya and according to widespread belief, believers in North   region don’t start any new work on this no moon day.

 
 But for voters in Badami, where chief minister Siddaramaiah (Congress) is up against MP B Sreeramulu (BJP), this amavasya, named after Badami, is a special day. While both parties’ workers are dreaming of their leader’s win, commoners are happy as they will get either a current CM or possible deputy CM as their MLA.
 
 “There is no connection between Badami town and Badami Amavasya. This Amavasya has the same name all over the world. It was named as Badami in ancient days when Badami town was called as Vatapi or Vatapipura,” said Subhas Koti, an astrologer from Gajendragad.
 
 
 
 
 Laxman Maraditota, who had filed his nomination as an independent supported by Janandolana Mahamaitri, said Siddaramaiah and Sreeramulu have equal influence in the region. “The victory margin will be very thin,” he said.
 
 
 
 
 A paan shop owner, who didn’t wish to be named, in Cholachagudda village said people attended rallies of both Congress and BJP. “But they never spoke openly about who they voted for,” he added.
 
 
 
 
 
 The Lingayats, around 60,000, are the highest in number. Though Shivayoga Mandir, birth place of Akhil Bharat Veerashaiva Mahasabha, is in Badami taluk, it has few supporters for Veerashaiva. Usually Panchamasali and Banajiga support the word Lingayat. If it works in favour of the Congress, Siddaramaiah could win. If Lingayats support the BJP, like in previous years, then Sreeramulu has a chance.
 
 
 
 
 Betting on the Badami outcome is rampant in Bagalkot district. At stake are sheep, goats, cows and other domestic animals in rural areas and sites, vehicles and cash in urban areas.
