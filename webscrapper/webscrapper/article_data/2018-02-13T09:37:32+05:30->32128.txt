VADODARA: The   (VMC)   has decided to cancel the work order and   involved in operations and   in the southern parts of the city. Half of the amount of the   (EMD) of the contractor will also be held back.

 The VMC had given a three-year contract in April last year to Vardhman Agencies for operations and management of streetlights. The contract was a part of the initiative taken by the civic body to privatise streetlight operations in the city. The step was taken owing to large vacancies in the streetlight department that often hampered work.
 
 The proposal to terminate the services of the contractor stated that the contractor was given repeated notices regarding unsatisfactory work, but did not respond. As a consequence the civic body took the decision to terminate his services.
 
 The proposal for termination of services of the contractor had stated that his work order and contract should be cancelled and he should be black listed. But the standing committee resolved that while the cancellation of the work order and contract should be taken up, half of his EMD should be held back as penalty.
