AHMEDABAD: The questioning of  , a   of Shailesh Bhatt, by state police’s   (crime) in the bitcoin extortion case continued on Sunday. Sources said that police are probing into about 45 accounts of cryptocurrency involved in the case, some of which were operated by Paladiya.

  Bhatt had approached state CID in February after a team of Amreli police abducted and illegally confined him and Paladiya near Gandhinagar and extorted 200 bitcoins worth Rs 12 crore and also tried to extort Rs 32 crore through hawala. After much speculations, CID finally made Paladiya accused in the case earlier this month.
 
 “The entire case of extortion hinges on the transactions in cryptocurrency. We have so far got inter-connected transactions not only associated with the main accused in the case but also other persons based in Surat as scope of the case is much broader now. We are hopeful of unearthing a widespread scam of converting black money into cryptocurrency post demonetization in Surat and elsewhere. Paladiya can play a major role in identifying those involved,” said an investigator.
 
 Sources said that CID is now searching for Dharmendra Pawar, a confidante of former Amreli SP Jagdish Patel. CID has got a record of Rs 90 lakh converted into Nexa, a cryptocurrency. Pawar is missing after Patel’s arrest, they added. It is suspected that a lot more cryptocurrency transactions will come out in near future.
 
 CID also approached former BJP MLA Nalin Kotadiya’s residence on Sunday. Investigators said that Kotadiya’s wife has mentioned in her statement that Kotadiya has been out for past five days.
