LUDHIANA: The first-ever raids conducted by the income tax department’s investigation wing after a gap of seven years in Shimla have led to a massive haul of   from three prominent jewellers there. Sources said they have been able to unearth illegal income of over Rs 8.5 crore from all three jewellers, one of whom is also into hotel business.

 The sources also revealed that after demonetization, the department found that these businessmen had accepted huge amounts of banned currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations from their customers, and sold them gold at Rs 50,000 per 10g. To deposit this cash in old notes in their bank accounts, these businessmen made backdated sale entries into their books. To conceal the identity of their customers who exchanged their old notes, these jewellers made entries in the names of fictitious persons. 
 
 Giving more info about their modus operandus, a senior IT official posted in Chandigarh said, “Not even a single bill of sales shown by these jewellers exceeded Rs 2 lakh. It was done so because as per law, they (jewellers) are supposed to collect the PAN number of the customer, and also charge one per cent tax collected at source (TCS). Obviously, they wanted to hide the identity of their buyers and evade   as well. These businessmen were also found to have made huge unaccounted investments in immovable properties, including in some recently constructed hotels. Considering the fact that the bank accounts were opened in the name of fictitious persons, we are also investigating the role of some bankers.”
 
 Sources said more jewellers from Shimla, Kangra, and Una -- who had amassed black money and indulged in conversion of old currency notes during demonetization -- are also in the radar of the department, which is likely to take action on more such offenders in the days to come.
