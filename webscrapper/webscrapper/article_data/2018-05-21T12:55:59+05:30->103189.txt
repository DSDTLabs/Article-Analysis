Tennis ace   said nothing has been finalised yet about a biopic on her life. There have been talks about a film being made on her life and there was also buzz that   would be helming the project.

  
  
 Asked about it, Sania told, "No, not yet... There's obviously been a lot of talk going on and in pipeline. But there's nothing official yet." Sania, who is married to cricketer  , is currently expecting their first child. They have decided to give the child the surname  , an amalgamation of their own last names.
 
 Explaining the decision, Sania said, "That is something that has come from being a woman and being in a position that I have been in all my life... Coming from a culture where a lot of people unfortunately feel that having a boy will take the family and its name forward, and will be the 'chirag' of the family."
 
 "I come from a family of two girls and we never felt the need to ever have a brother and we were never treated differently. That's the kind of thought process that really is in that. It's a pretty simple thing. At the end of the day, my husband is obviously someone who thinks that way as well. And it takes a very secure and a strong man to say I want my wife's name along with mine. So I think that's really what it was."
 
 "Mirza-Malik is something that we always wanted. Even when we were not planning a baby many years ago... We used to talk about it that one day we would name the baby Mirza-Malik... We are looking forward to it, and regardless of whether it's a boy or a girl, we are really proud to go with both our names."
