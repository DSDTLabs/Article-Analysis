PANAJI: Unlike the usual situation when being halted by traffic police often means having to pay a fine or a bribe, people plying on the state’s roads on Tuesday were in for a surprise when traffic police stopped them and handed them a rose. The move was aimed at appreciating drivers who were following traffic rules and is being carried out in view of the global road safety week. 

 Talking about the initiative, assistant director of transport Meghashyam Pilernekar said that the enforcement teams is carrying out a special drive and are checking vehicles for violations. 
 
 “The enforcement teams have upped their checking duties and are fining people who are caught without wearing helmets or seat belts. That apart, we are also giving roses to people who are found to be following the rules. The police teams are also conducting awareness drives and educating people about road safety and the dangers of rash driving,” Pilernekar said, adding that the department will be conducting similar activities on a much bigger level during the Goa road safety week and the national road safety week.
