COIMBATORE: Warming up to actor Rajinikanth, BJP state president   said on Sunday that the BJP would be strengthened if the superstar joined the saffron party. 

 Talking to reporters in Coimbatore on Sunday, Tamilisai said the nationalistic views of   would sync with that of BJP's. Few days ago, Tamilisai sounded a little critical about Rajnikanth speech at his fans' meeting, since he left out Prime Minister Narendra Modi's name while listing out few 'good leaders'. 
 
 "Though I would not say BJP's sole strength would be Rajnikanth, our party would be strengthened if he joins us," she said. Her statement comes in the backdrop of party president   saying he would welcome the superstar anytime into BJP fold. Meanwhile, a group of Rajnikanth fans held a meeting in Salem and warned politicians who criticise their film icon. "Some politicians have made unfair accusations on our 'thalaivar', which is being spread in social media. We strongly condemn those politicians. If they continue to spread such rumours, we would stage protests in front of their houses," said advocate Senthil, a Rajni fan who had participated in the meeting.
