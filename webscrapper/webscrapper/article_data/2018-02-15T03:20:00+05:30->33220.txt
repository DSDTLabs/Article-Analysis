Panaji:  , son of former home minister and senior Congress functionary Ravi Naik, on Wednesday did not appear for a second time before the special investigating team (SIT) probing the alleged Rs 35,000-crore illegal mining scam. 

 Roy had been asked to appear before the investigating officer on February 9. 
 
 Roy had skipped the first summons and had filed for anticipatory bail before the sessions court in Panaji earlier this week.
 
 He was then issued a second summons, as per which he was to appear before the SIT on Wednesday. But he failed to appear again. 
 
 Earlier this month, the SIT had filed a provisional chargesheet against 16 accused, including former chief minister Digambar Kamat, in connection with the main case.
