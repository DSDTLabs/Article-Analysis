 HYDERABAD: Visitors walking into the  , on Saturday, for the biennial civil aviation show were left thoroughly disappointment, with many even calling it an absolute dud. Apart from the missing aerobatics show - usually the main attraction of the event - the thin fleet of aircraft on display at the arena came has a huge damper for the general public. Worse, they paid a steep Rs 400 per ticket to gain entry. 
 
 As is the norm, the last two days of the aviation show - re-branded as Wings India 2018 this time around - is dedicated for regular visitors who are allowed to walk into the airport to get a dekko of the flights and also enjoy a show put up by trained professionals. But while this weekend event has always been a hit in the past, this year it had failed miserably to excite the audience. 
 
 "This is not even 20 per cent of what it used to be earlier. The air show, which was the best part here, is also missing. They don't even have the big aircraft this time," said a visibly irked  , among the visitors spotted at the airport on Saturday. 
 
 The reaction of Gavindacharan, a software engineer, wasn't any different. He said: "This time the number of aircraft has decreased and this has disappointed me. During the previous editions of the show I have seen some very exciting chartered flights and Boeing planes on display. This year there's nothing."
 
 Not surprisingly then, unlike other years when visitors were found spending an entire day at the event, many left the airport within a few hours of getting there, despite paying a fat amount for the ticket - double of what it used to be until a few years ago. 
 
 But despite the abysmally poor turnout, top   officials appeared in the least perturbed and even justified the fare hike.
