MUMBAI: Long-distance train passengers have complained that   operators continue to overcharge for food and beverages even though the railway ministry has assured strict action against violators.

 Avinash Nalawade, a passenger, said, “I had comes across messages on social media about   by pantry car operators. I decided to test the system by ordering food. To my surprise, overcharging was rampant on   during my journey on March 19.”
 
 Nalawade ordered a bread omelette and cup of tea. As per the rate published by the ministry online, the bill for these items comes to Rs42, including Rs7 for tea and Rs35 for a bread omelette. But he said he was charged Rs50, including Rs10 for tea.
 
 When Nalawade showed him the online rates, the waiter told him to pay Rs56 and a bill was prepared with a breakup of Rs32 for an omelette, Rs17 for bread butter and Rs7 for tea. The pantry car employee said the menu card rates for that train were different. 
 
 Nalwade said, “Being an aware citizen, I was able to confront him with the facts but most commuters were paying whatever he was asking.”
 
 K P Babu, a Kerala resident, said, “I was once charged Rs80 for a biryani while travelling from Thrissur to Mumbai by Netravati Express. Why can’t the   put up rate cards in compartments as the rates are uniform?”
 
 A   official said, “Action will be taken against the contractor for overcharging. In fact, we will intensify the drive through surprise checks to keep a control on overcharging. Instructions have been issued to be strict with pantry card operators on overcharging and quality-related issues.”
 
 The ministry on March 21 tweeted the rate card for food items and requested that any discrepancy should be tweeted to @RailMinIndia.
