KANNUR: Governor   said on Sunday that it was time to revisit the people’s planning programme and make it more effective by giving power to the villages.

 The people’s planning programme is a model for other states but even after 20 years of the decentralization of power, there exist nearly three lakh homeless people in the state, he said inaugurating the state-level Panchayat Day celebration here.
 
  “In order to make decentralization work, our planning should begin at the grassroots level,” he said.
 
 At the same time, the 50% seat reservation for women in the local body elections underscores the importance given to women, said the governor, adding that Kerala has set a model for other states in various sectors including education, healthcare and land reformation.
 
 Sathasivam also said that we should have an effective waste management system in place and there should be a curb on the use of disposables and plastic bottles.
 
 Warning about the summer that we are about to face this year, the governor called upon the panchayats and other local bodies to focus on their own watershed management systems instead of waiting for the   to manage the impending drought situation.
 
 Further, the Haritha Keralam Mission of the state government also should give importance to the farmers, urged the governor. 
 
 In his presidential address, local self-government minister   said a welfare fund and insurance scheme for former panchayat members is on the anvil. He said that there was also a proposal to increase the sitting fees of the panchayat members and presidents, which is under the consideration of the government.
