BHUBANESWAR: Tribals in   are ready to observe annual   on Tuesday. The festival included the ritual sacrifice of thousands of animals at  , the main seat of the celebrations. The district police have made adequate arrangements to maintain law and order at the site.

 Unlike the past one decade, this year the district administration has not clamped prohibitory orders (Section 144 of CrPC) in view of the September 28, 2015,   on animal sacrifice. In response to a PIL, a division bench of the apex court had refused to interfere with religious practices and said the judiciary could not stop the centuries-old traditions of sacrificing animals by different communities.
 
 "We have only appealed to the organisers to maintain peace while celebrating the festival. We will deploy around four platoons of police force at Khairguda and senior officers will oversee the security arrangement as around one lakh people will congregate at the place," said SP (Balangir) Ashish Singh. 
 
 Animals such as goat, buffalo and chicken are sacrificed at the altar of Sulia Budha, the presiding deity of the tribals. The festival starts early morning with people making beeline for the festival site with the animals. The tribals believe that by offering animal blood to the deity, their wishes will be fulfilled. 
 
 Last year, the district administration had created awareness among the tribals for conducting sattvik (without animal sacrifice) ritual.
