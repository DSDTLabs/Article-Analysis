ALLAHABAD: A youth killed himself after shooting a girl on Thursday near Shantipuram locality under Soraon police station. The deceased has been identified as   (24), a resident of Hathigaon. 

 The injured girl, Kriti Singh (23) , of Mohammadpur was undergoing treatment at a city hospital where her condition was stated to be stable. Deputy SP (Soraon) said that in her  , the injured girl had stated that the youth had been trying to speak to her but she had refused to engage in a conversation with him. 
 
 Passersby rushed up to them to find them both bleeding profusely. The duo were later taken to SRN hospital for treatment where the youth breathed his last during treatment. 
 
 Police have recovered a suicide note from the youth's pocket, supposedly written by a girl claiming they were both going to kill themselves. Police said initial investigations point at the fact that the two, who lived in neighbouring villages, had known each other since childhood. It could be the case of a jilted lover trying to take revenge as this year on April 18, the girl was married off to another man, said police. That could have triggered the attack.
