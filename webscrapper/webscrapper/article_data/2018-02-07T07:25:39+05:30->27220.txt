BENGALURU: After spearheading farmers’ agitation over   river water, pro-Kannada organizations are now thinking of taking a plunge into electoral politics. They are planning to stitch up a coalition under  , a federation of organizations, to fight the assembly polls.

 The pro-Kannada outfits are buoyed by the positive response their agitation has evoked, especially the successful Karnataka bandh they’d called on January 25.
 
 “We want to put up a fight for protecting our rights over water and land in a democratic manner. We are discussing the possibilities of a coalition,” said  , president of   that was in the forefront of the Mahadayi agitation.
 
 Kannada Okkuta leaders are planning to field candidates in as many assembly seats as possible, especially in Bengaluru, the   belt and north Karnataka districts where farmers are fighting for Mahadayi water.
 
 Vatal and Govindu are likely to choose constituencies in Bengaluru. Vatal, who represented Chickpet and Chamarajpet assembly seats in 1967 and 1972 respectively, now wants to contest from Malleswaram.
 
 However, analysts say pro-Kannada outfits can only look for a symoblic presence in the election arena. “The only interesting thing will be pro-Kannada outfits seeking to fight elections separately when the ruling   itself is inclined to play the regionalism card against the BJP’s brand of nationalism,” said K Satyanarayana, a veteran journalist.
 
 Vatal, however, begged to differ. “Our contest will be serious. We will maintain equal distance from national parties as we believe they can never ensure justice to regional issues,” he said.
