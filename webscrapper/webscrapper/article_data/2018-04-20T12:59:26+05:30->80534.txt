After weeks of anticipation, CM Bharat finally takes charge. Yes, we’re talking about   playing the role of the Andhra Pradesh chief minister in Koratala Siva’s ambitious film, 
 . 

 
 
  Raised in London, Bharat is your typical youth who is yet to figure out what he’ll do in life after graduation, when his father, who’s also the AP CM, passes away. With his sudden demise leaving a political vacuum and political instabilty, party chief (Prakash Raj) makes a reluctant Bharat the next chief minister to ensure the party remains stable. 
 
  While the party chief was expecting a puppet who can toe the line, Bharat turns out to be a different character. Righteous and efficient, he promises change and goes all out to try and deliver it.
 
  The filmmaker takes cinematic liberties at will, be it his romantic sequences with Vasumathi ( ) or the CM getting into fist fight with a corrupt politician in a dramatic pre-interval sequence. And yet,   packs a punch and keeps the viewers interested. A political drama where you root for the underdog, who also happens to be a handsome, young and incorruptible CM. What’s not to like?
