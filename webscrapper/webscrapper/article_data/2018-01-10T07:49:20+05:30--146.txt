This and other decisions were taken in the meeting of governing body of Campa held under the chairmanship of chief minister   on Tuesday .

  minister   and forest and wildlife minister Rao Narbir were also present in the meeting. It was also decided in the meeting that since the forest and tree cover area in Haryana needs to be increased from the existing 6.65% to 20%, as mandated for plain areas in the National Forest Policy, the Centre may be requested to allow the state to purchase land for raising forest from funds available under Campa.
