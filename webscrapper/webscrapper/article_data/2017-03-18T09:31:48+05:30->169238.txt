SRINAGAR: Reclining next to her injured six-year-old son Faisal on a bed in Srinagar's main hospital,   is still in shock. Her 12 year-old daughter, Kaneeza, was killed in crossfire between Pakistani terrorists and Indian security forces on Wednesday in her village  , in Kupwara district.

 Begum, 32, recalls the blood-soaked bed where Kaneeza took the fatal bullet.The child died due to loss of blood in a dingy room where she was sleeping next to her mother and brother, Faisal, who too was hit. He is being treated at SMHS hospital for injuries to his back and shoulder but is recovering.
 
 The six-member family has almost no means of livelihood. It lives in a dilapidated mud house in the village across the stream near the Line of Control (LoC) where Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists were hiding in a house.
 
 Makhini said she and her bedridden husband,  , heard the gunshots while their children, three sons and Kaneeza, slept next to them.
 
 “Faisal woke up screaming when a bullet hit him. But I was unaware that Kaneeza was already dead, without even a murmur. I then found the bed sticky soaked in her blood,“ she wept.
 
 Makhini managed to ta ke Faisal to a hospital on Thursday morning after the terrorists were killed. “The forces did not allow us to go out when firing was on. We were crying but nobody heard us,“ she said.
 
 Her husband buried their daughter with the help of villagers. SSP, Kupwara, Shamsher Hussain said the family refused to leave their house before the counter-terrorism operation was launched. The house was certainly in the line of fire, he said.
