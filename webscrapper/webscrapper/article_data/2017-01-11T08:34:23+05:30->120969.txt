JAIPUR: The   on Tuesday asked the state government to give details of all temporary tollbooths operating within the jurisdiction limits of   (JDA). The court also sought to know with whose permission such tollbooths were operating.

 The issue was raised during the hearing of a matter related to alleged police compliance in letting off some tollbooth staff at Tatiyawala on the   road that was accused of beating up some commuters in April 2016. Petitioner Mohan Gurjar filed a petition saying that the Chomu police were deliberately not acting against the tollbooth’s staff, Richpal Kharra and Pradeep Hada, who thrashed him and his friends at Tatiyawala.
 
 “Police arrested only the tollbooth’s petty staff and purposely left out Kharra and Hada, even though the duo was named in the FIR,” Gurjar’s counsel   told the high court. The single bench of Justice   later asked the police to file a reply by January 18 as to why it did not act against the two main accused.
 
 The court was told that the temporary tollbooth at Tatiyawala was erected near JDA’s residential scheme Anand Lok. Gurjar and his companions were allegedly bashed up over a toll argument when they had gone to see their land in the   scheme, which falls in the city limits.
