MUMBAI: Three years after a Chunabhatti police station team claimed to have   and also  , the   on Monday acquitted the accused, Wahid Shaikh (38),  

 The woman’s charred body was found on tracks near Kurla and was beyond recognition. The police team claimed to have cracked the case based on an hip replacement implant found in her body during the post-mortem. Shaikh has been in jail since his arrest in 2014.
 
 On November 16, 2014, some youths found the woman’s body on a ground in Kurla (E) and informed a businessman in the locality, who called the police. When the police came to know from the post-mortem report that the woman had undergone a hip replacement surgery, they got in touch with the company that had provided the steel rod. From the firm, they got the details of the doctor who had conducted the surgery. The police said that the doctor identified the woman as Hafizabi Khaton (62) and gave them her address. They had said during investigations, they zeroed in on Shaikh, who, they claimed, strangled her and set her body on fire. The body was dumped on the ground. On November 19, 2014, they arrested Shaikh.
 
 Defence advocate Tariq Khan said, “I submitted that the identity of the woman was in question. While the doctor said the surgery for the implant was done in March 2013, the bill produced on record was dated April 2014. Further, there were discrepancies in the alleged recovery of the ornaments that the police said were stolen by the accused. This showed that the prosecution’s case was faulty and could not be proved.” 
 
 A police official said it is not necessary that the best detections lead to court convictions. “Sometimes the evidence might be weak,” he added.
