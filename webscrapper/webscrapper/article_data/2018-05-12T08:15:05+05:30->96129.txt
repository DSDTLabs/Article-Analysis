CHENNAI : Hours after making a   hoax to the US consulate-general in Nungambakkam on a call to the   control room  , a 30-year-man was arrested by the police on Friday. 

 The   police traced Shaddique Batcha, 30, a resident of Mannadi, after his wife called the Chennai city police control room and apologised for his doing and also claimed that her husband was mentally disturbed. 
 
 The police received the call at 9.53pm on Thursday, with the caller claiming that he had planted bombs on the premises of the high security   office, set to go off at 3.16am on May 11. 
 
 Bomb detection and disposal squad (BDDS) combed through the premises from 10.45pm to 11.50pm before declaring the call as a hoax. The police then called Batcha on his mobile from which he had made the call, following which his wife stepped in and took him to the Royapettah police station. On questioning, it was learnt that he made the prank call as he felt the consulate officials had least regard for people queuing up outside the premises for visa, said a police officer. “Batcha went to a Tasmac shop on Thambu Chetty Street and made the prank call when under the influence of  ,” an officer said.
 
 Preliminary inquiries revealed that Batcha had on several occasions earlier acted as carrier to smuggle electronic goods from abroad. He was remanded in judicial custody.
