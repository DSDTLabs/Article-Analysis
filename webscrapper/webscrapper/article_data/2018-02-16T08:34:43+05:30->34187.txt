ROHTAK: Expressing disappointment over the BJP’s ‘Yuva Hunkar’ rally at   on Thursday, Akhil Bharatiya   Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (ABJASS) Haryana chief Hawa Singh Sangwan said the event had nothing for the Jat community. Sangwan said they had expected BJP chief Amit Shah to say something about the Jat quota in his rally speech.

 The Jat community has been on warpath since 2016, seeking reservation under the other backward classes (OBC) category in government jobs and admission to educational institutions. “BJP has again proved that it just wants to fool the Jats to take their votes but does not want to extend them the benefits of quota in the state and at the Centre,” Sangwan said.
 
 Vowing to relaunch the Jat stir for reservation, Sangwan said his organization would launch an indefinite dharna at Igraha village in Jind from February 19 to press for their demand. “This will be our ultimate fight and dharna would be lifted only after the demands are met. No other thing will make us take back our steps this time,” he warned.
 
 He took on AIJASS leader   for allegedly attempting to divide the community for political benefits.
 
 Meanwhile, the deployment of security forces will continue in Rohtak owing to a call by the AIJASS to celebrate ‘Balidan Diwas’ on February 18 across the state. The administrations of Charkhi Dadri and Rohtak have imposed Section 144 (banning assembly of more than four persons) of the CrPC in the wake of this call in the memory those killed in the Jat agitation for reservation in February 2016.
