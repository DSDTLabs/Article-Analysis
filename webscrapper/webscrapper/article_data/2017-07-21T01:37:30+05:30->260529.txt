NEW DELHI: The Delhi   celebrated the   of its most popular animal – Vijay, the   — as it turned 10 on Thursday, with a cake and a cutout of the animal. The enclosure was decorated with garlands and flowers as around 100 schoolchildren took part in the celebrations.

 This was the first time that the zoo celebrated the birthday of an animal, a practice it now hopes to make a regular feature. “The purpose was to celebrate one of our most popular attractions and at the same time provide more knowledge to children about the white tiger and its habitat. Similarly, we plan to celebrate the birthdays of other animals too and hold more interactive events involving children,” said  , director of Delhi zoo.
 
 The celebrations began with a ‘Walk for Vijay’ in which the schoolchildren and zoo officials took part, followed by cake-cutting in front of the tiger’s enclosure. While Vijay roamed around nonchalantly in its enclosure, a cardboard cutout of the animal was ‘fed’ the cake.
 
 “The cutout will act as a selfie point. An education programme for children was also held on the occasion, followed by a quiz,” said Singh.
 
 The animal was in the news in 2014, after mauling a man to death who had fallen into the enclosure. Vijay was born in the zoo in 2007 to Laxman and Yamuna. While Laxman died in 2009, Yamuna was transferred to the Gwalior zoo in 2011. Vijay has fathered five cubs in the zoo, with female white tiger Kalpana.
 
 Zoo officials said that plans are afoot for other celebrations too, including that of Rita the chimpanzee, which is the oldest animal at the zoo.
