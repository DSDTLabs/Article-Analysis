 recently got married to her long-term boyfriend, Anand Ahuja on 8th May. After wooing everyone with her bridal outfits, she continued to slay with her sartorial choices at the 71st edition of Cannes. Currently, the actress is shuffling between her newly married life and movie promotions for her upcoming film 'Veere Di Wedding'.

 
 Creating a lot of buzz with her promotional looks, Sonam is really proving her fashionista status in Bollywood. And now, she is seen gracing the cover of Femina India's June issue. Spotted wearing a short and flirty black dress by a Dutch-designer label, RVDK, Sonam seems ready to slay. Looking at the magazine cover, you'll easily believe that she's got a haircut, while in the inside shots, you can see her gorgeous long locks. 
 
 
  
  
 
 For the cover shoot, she has been styled by Chandini Whabi. In one of inside pictures, she is seen wearing a light blue textured dress from Ruban, which has been styled with a denim jacket over her shoulders. Going barefoot for the shot, Sonam looks all poise and grace in the pastel-blue dress. 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 Another shot from this series making rounds on the internet has Sonam wearing a silver dress. Keeping her look super edgy, she is seen wearing a metallic Dior dress paired with a cropped bomber jacket. For this look, hairstylist Hiral Bhatia has given her tousled waves, while the make-up artist Arti Nayar has given her a hint of shimmer on the eyes and kept her look neutral with matte make-up and a nude lip colour.
