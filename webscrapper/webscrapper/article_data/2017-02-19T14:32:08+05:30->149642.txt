 Ricky Martin says his children are his toughest critics and often give him advice on how he can improve his performances.
 
  
  
 Speaking on 'The   Starring Jimmy Fallon,' the 45-year-old star, who has eight-year-old twin sons,   and Matteo, said, "They travel with me everywhere and they sit backstage and they look at my show every night. One day one of them went like, 'Daddy, what happened tonight? I didn't like this part. Yesterday was better, last night was better.'" 
 
 He added, "Matteo loves drums, he might come one day (to perform). Valentino is so sweet. He loves mud and I love that he loves mud. He loves 'Peppa Pig.'" 
 
 Martin also opened up about his engagement to longtime partner  , saying "I'm really happy". When asked how he met his fiance, he said, "He is a conceptual artist and I'm a collector, and I saw his art on the Internet and I contacted him. Then we met and everything's been perfect."
