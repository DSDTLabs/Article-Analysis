COIMBATORE: Residents of the city joined hands with nearly 200 members of the   and 20   of the civic body to clean up the   at Perur on Sunday. They also surveyed the area to find out the sanitation problems in the region and invited corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan to look into the issues.

 Timple Luloo, a resident who was part of the clean-up work, said they cleared nearly 8 tonnes of   from the area. “The civic body’s 20 sanitary workers supported us and helped us clean the garbage. We are hopeful that after two more such clean up drives, the area will become spick and span,” she said.
 
 Manikandan, a volunteer, said the condition of the lake was pathetic. “There was open defecation and several companies were letting out waste into it. The lake is very important environmentally as several migratory birds visit it,” he said.
 
  
  
 
 The volunteers found a beverage company and some other units letting chemical waste into the lake. They warned the companies and requested the civic body officials to take action against them. They also found that nearly 80 houses in the area were using the lake as an open toilet as the area lacked community toilets or individual household toilets.
 
 The corporation commissioner, who interacted with the people, has promised them to construct a community toilet in the area. The volunteers also said they would look for sponsors to set up household toilets for the residents.
