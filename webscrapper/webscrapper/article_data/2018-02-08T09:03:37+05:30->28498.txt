HYDERABAD: Congress leaders V Hanumantha Rao and A   on Wednesday spewed venom at chief minister   and his son and IT Minister  .

 Reacting sharply to KTR’s comment that Congress was a loafer party and Rahul Gandhi a ‘pappu’, Revanth said, “If anybody checks on Google who is washing bathrooms in America, they will find KTR’s name.”
 
 He said   is not even fit to get a ‘chaprasi’ or watchman job, but is serving as a minister because his father is the CM. “KTR has cleaned bathrooms in America. He was involved in settling a film studio land case and also a case in Odisha.”
 
 Referring to Congress leader Boddupalli Srinivas’s murder in Nalgonda, Hanumantha Rao alleged KCR of encouraging murder politics to suppress Congress. He said KCR has failed to fulfil his promises and is also not taking up the issue of adequate budgetary support with the Centre.
