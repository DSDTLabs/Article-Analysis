CHARMINAR: The ailing   (OGH), a   once protected by regulation 13 of the  , is  . While it serves hundreds of patients everyday, the authorities have chosen to ignore its state of complete disrepair. 

 It was last year that the government announced that it will tear down one of the finest examples of  , also known as Osmanian architecture . A Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University report, commissioned by the Telangana government, noted that the OGH buildings could stand for a period of only five years post-repair. Soon after, outrage against the proposed demolition poured onto the streets forcing the government to abandon its plans of demolition. 
 
 But little has changed regarding the conservation of the structure. The facade is crumbling while the interiors too are crying for attention. A walk around the heritage structure reveals the exposed brick work with the lime mortar peeled off from the some of the outer walls, and at other places, chunks of it have fallen off. Drainage continues to seep from pipes installed on the exterior of the building and trees, several feet tall, can be seen on portions of the roof. 
 
 "There are trees growing on the terrace. All it takes is some physical work to remove them. But the government is not doing anything. If this is the case, the government's plans of demolishing the OGH will be realised without even hiring a wrecking crew," an observer pointed out. Convener of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, Hyderabad chapter, Anuradha Reddy said that while abandoning plans of demolishing OGH was a welcome move, the government should now take steps to conserve it. "The government seems serious about heritage now. It should now release funds for its conservation and complete restoration."
