NEW DELHI: Residents in a densely-populated neighbourhood in   recently heard an unusual broadcast emanating from their town's public announcement system - the adult soundtrack of a porn film, complete with loud, sultry moans and groans.

 "Unmoral provocation" is how the town's mayor described the incident. A video clip purportedly showing the shocked reaction of residents to the sounds surfaced on   and, of course, went viral. 
 
 The soundtrack was blasted through a loudspeaker in the Kuzykent neighbourhood in   province last week,   Daily News reported.
 
 "The unmoral provocation that had been conducted by intercepting the announcement system of our municipality and heard in certain spots in our Kuzeykent neighbourhood has no relation with our institution. The necessary legal processes will be launched as soon as possible for those who are responsible for this unmoral act and we apologize to our precious fellow townsmen for this situation," Kastamonu mayor Tahsin Babas said in a   post.
 
 
 
 The mayor alleged it was caused by miscreants hacking into the frequency used by the public announcement system. He also apologized to the citizens for "any offense caused" by the incident. Police backed the mayor's claims that hackers were responsible for the late night performance.
 
 "We think that they intercepted the municipality frequency because it occurred in only one region... One can broadcast what he or she wants after spotting the frequency wave," an official told Hurriyet Daily News.
