Ghaziabad: The GDA has identified four locations in   to set up vending zones to accommodate hawkers and vendors that at present encroach upon streets and roads in the township. The list of these four vending zones was presented in a meeting held by DM   on Thursday to figure out means to rid the city from the clutches of encroachers.

 According to the GDA, 1,000   have been identified for whom alternate space will be provided within the township.
 
 “Though we have identified 1,000 vendors we have identified space that can accommodate over 1,100 vendors. Four vacant parcels of land in Indirapuram will be used for setting up the vending zones,” GDA executive engineer H L Singh told TOI.
 
 The green belt in Shakti Khand 4, running parallel to the Hindon Canal, which had recently been cleared of illegally operating banquet halls and farm houses is one of the four locations set up for vending zones. An 800 sqm plot of land near Shanti Gopal Hospital in   2 is another plot identified for a vending zone. In addition, two parcels of land near the sewage treatment plant along CISF-Vasundhara Road will also be used to accommodate vendors. A total of 500 vendors will be accommodated separately on the two vending zones near the STP.
 
 Officials said a project report will be prepared for developing these plots as vending zones.
