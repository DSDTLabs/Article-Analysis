AHMEDABAD: The state police’s CID (crime) investigating the   case questioned Kirit  , the business partner of Shailesh Bhatt on Monday. Bhatt, a Surat realtor, had submitted an application of complaint against Amreli police in February alleging abduction, illegal confinement, and extortion. CID has arrested five accused including Amreli SP  .

 
 Dipankar  , DIG, CID, who is heading the special investigation team in the case, said: “Paladiya has not been arrested. If his role emerges, he will be an accused. It is premature to comment now.” 
 
 Trivedi said that  , a former BJP MLA, might be summoned as his name has cropped up in a few statements. Sources said that seven head constables and constables named in the FIR filed by CID tried to surrender but CID resisted the move. 
 
 CID has unearthed transactions of Rs 1.33 crore of which Rs 40 lakh was allegedly provided to the policemen on the run in Ahmedabad in April. The incident might tie Jagdish Patel, the alleged sender of the money, to the case. CID officials on Monday said that they are minutely examining the case-related events of February 11. “We have learnt that across the world, on the said date, only eight transactions of exactly 200 bitcoins had taken place,” a senior official said. “None of these transactions were related to the Gandhinagar deal. However, the possibility that the bitcoins were transferred later has not been ruled out.”
 
 CID had questioned inspector of Rajula police station recently but officials maintained that the inspector is not associated with the case.
