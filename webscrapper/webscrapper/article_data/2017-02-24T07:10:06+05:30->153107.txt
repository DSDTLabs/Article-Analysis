NEW DELHI: In an unusual request, one of the largest universities in the country, the   (BHU), recently asked for CISF cover for its campus citing "security reasons", a request which has been categorically 'denied' by central paramilitary force. 

  Officials sources said that BHU vice-chancellor   had written to ministry of human resources and development (HRD) recently asking for CISF cover, especially for Sir   located within the campus. The request was handed over to CISF for its consideration. 
 
  Tripathi wanted the security of a professional force on the ground because "ordinary security was not able to handle the daily footfall at the 100-year-old university". Presently, about 900 security guards, supervisors and security officers of   (UPPSKNL) and private security agencies look after the security of the 1,400 acre varsity campus. 
 
  Talking to TOI , Tripathi said, "BHU is a completely different university. There is a temple, a hospital, trauma centre, museum and its own faculties. Hospital, museum and temple are being used by public since its beginning and there is a thorough fare which you won't see in any other university". 
 
  He added, the BHU university campus has 90 hostels, more than 24,000 girls and boys living there, 10,000 staff, and a hospital with 1,700 beds where thousands of people come every day.
