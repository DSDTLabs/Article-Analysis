ROHTAK: Commenting on Indian National Lok Dal leader Abhay Chautala’s promise to his workers that he would return favours by providing them jobs if voted to power, chief minister   on Sunday said there could be no other formula to destroy the youth of the state.

 Khattar, who was in Jind on Sunday to participate in Maharana Partap’s anniversary celebrations, termed it an unfortunate political statement given by the INLD leadership. He said the said party had earlier too resorted to such gimmicks to pull votes and such statements only work to spoil the atmosphere of the state.
 
 “There can be no other formula to destroy the future of the youth in Haryana than this”, he said.
 
 Abhay, while addressing a party workers’ meeting recently in Jind, had reportedly asked his workers to support them in forming the government and get jobs for their family members in return. Chautala had reportedly said they had taken care of the party workers’ interest earlier as well.
