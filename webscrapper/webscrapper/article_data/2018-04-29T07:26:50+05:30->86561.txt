PUNE: A 23-year-old man arrested for killing his wife gave two constables the slip on the premises of the Faraskhana police station on Saturday afternoon. 

 The suspect,   (23), is a resident of Manajinagar in Narhe. A city court remanded him in police custody on Friday, a day after he was arrested.
 
 On Saturday morning, the two constables and a driver took him to Sassoon General Hospital for a medical check-up in a police van. The case investigation officer was on his weekly-off. 
 
 After the medical check-up, Handale was ferried to the Faraskhana police station around 2.30pm, where the lock-up is located. The two constables alighted from the van and opened the door where Handale was sitting. The suspect jumped from the van and ran away.
 
 A source in the police said, “Handale was not handcuffed and none of the police constables were holding his arms either.” 
 
 The two constables and others on the police station premises chased Handale but he quickly disappeared in the crowd. It is suspected that he boarded a PMPML bus heading towards Swargate from Shivaji Road.
 
 Police were registering an offence against Handale at the   police station till late in the night on Saturday.
 
 The   police had arrested Handale on Thursday morning for murdering his wife, Komal, at their residence. He suspected her of infidelity. After killing Komal, he had applied lipstick to her lips and draped her in a new sari.
 
 The police said Handale was booked and arrested in 10 serious offences in the past four years.
