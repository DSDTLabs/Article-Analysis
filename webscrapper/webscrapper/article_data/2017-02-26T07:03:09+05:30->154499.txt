 At present, the city has close to 1,500 animals and birds, including 25 Nilgai, 18 Black Buck, eight Indian Gaur and eight Hog Deer. While each year the zoo sees two to three offsprings of each specie being born, the Hog Deer fawn was born after a gap of many years, zoo authorities said. “The new babies are getting a lot of atten tion from visitors, especially from children. Even grown ups walking into the zoo are amused to see the fawn jump and run around,“ said a caretaker of the new-borns in the zoo.
