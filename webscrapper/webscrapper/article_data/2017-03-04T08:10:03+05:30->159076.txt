KOHIMA: The   of   for the 2017-2018 fiscal is scheduled to be held from March 21.

 Liezietsu is the third chief minister in this third innings of the NPF, which will end in February 2018.
 
 Liezietsu took over from T R Zeliang on February 22 as the latter had to step down bowing to pressures of the peoples' movement led by   and   on moral grounds.
 
 The two bodies had imposed a bandh throughout the state for almost three weeks demanding Zeliang's resignation on 'moral grounds' following the death of three protestors, including two in police firing in Dimapur.
 
 They were part of the public movement against holding of Urban Local Body (ULB) elections with 33 per cent seats reserved for women in the state.
 
 The upcoming assembly session will also witness election of a new speaker since Chotisuh Sazo, who was the speaker of the state assembly has been inducted as a cabinet minister for Public Health Engineering in Liezietsu's ministry.
 
 Meanwhile, Nagaland Governor P B Acharya has appointed Imtikumzuk, Deputy Speaker of   (NLA) to take charge of duties of the speaker till the new speaker is elected.
