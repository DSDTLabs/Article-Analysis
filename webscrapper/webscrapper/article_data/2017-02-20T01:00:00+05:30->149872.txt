 and  , the newest popular lead couple Kartik and Naira in  , have blurred professional and personal lines. They have emerged as the latest lovebirds in town. While the rumours started doing the rounds some time ago, Mohsin told us that they started dating only recently.
He says, “Several theories have been doing the rounds, including our link-up, but we didn’t allow it to affect our friendship or work. In fact, there was nothing to talk about initially, since we were just friends. Our friendship graduated to love only recently; it’s just been a month-and-a-half. We rang in the New Year with my family. Funnily, we haven’t gone out on an official date yet, owing to our erratic schedule.”
 Ask him what made him fall for Shivangi and he replies, “I haven’t really thought about it. I guess it’s her innocence. We are still exploring each other. It has been a long friendship and a beautiful journey, which has now blossomed into love.”
