MUMBAI: The MRA Marg police, under the supervision of zonal DCP Manoj Kumar Sharma, raided White House Bar in Fort on Wednesday night. Eight   were dancing in the bar which didn’t have a   licence, said the police. 

 “The bar employees had a modus operandi under which few of them would monitor the gates. They would carry whistles with them. If they saw policemen coming, they would blow the whistle and the girls would stop dancing,” said Sharma. The police said that the bar had licence for four girls to sing in the bar, but police found eight of them. The manager of the bar has been arrested.
