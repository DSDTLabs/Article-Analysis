BENGALURU: The high court on Friday quashed the October 19, 2016 order of the   (KSAT), directing the government to appoint 362 candidates of the 2011 batch of the   ( ) gazetted probationers' examination. 

 Sustaining the August 14, 2014 order of withdrawing requisition to KPSC, a division bench of Justices H G   and P S   quashed the March 27, 2017 order of the municipal administration department appointing 18 successful candidates based on the KSAT ruling.
 
 Allowing a petition filed by   and others, the bench noted that the tribunal, instead of examining the government's August 14, 2014 order withdrawing the final selection list, exceeded its domain and substituted its opinion. It instead gave a direction to the government to issue appointment orders.
 
  The HC noted that the CID report contains sufficient material to infer that the selection process stood vitiated, and there was no error on the government's part to withdraw the requisition given to KPSC.
