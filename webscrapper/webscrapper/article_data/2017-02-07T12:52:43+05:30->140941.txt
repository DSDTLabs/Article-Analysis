Singer   has won a legal battle against reality star   over the trademark of their shared first name. 

  
  
 The US Patent and   rejected Jenner's claim, but the 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' star is already planning an appeal to use the brand name 'Kylie' for her growing fashion and beauty lines.
 
 In 2014, Jenner, 19, filed a US trademark application for the term 'Kylie,' seeking protection for the term in connection with advertising services. 
 
 Minogue, 48, filed a notice of opposition to Jenner's application in February 2016. Court document submitted by KDB, an Australian-based business representing Minogue, claimed that approval of Jenner's application will confuse audiences and dilute Minogue's brand. 
 
 The company also pointed out the fact that the   star currently owns trademark registrations for the term 'Kylie' across entertainment services and music recordings.
