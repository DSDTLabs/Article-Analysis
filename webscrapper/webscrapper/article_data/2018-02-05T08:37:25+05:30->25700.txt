PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Municipal commissioner   has turned down a request to rethink the construction of ramps for the long-pending Empire Estate flyover in  .

 A delegation of corporators met   with a list of problems the residents of the society will face, if the ramps are constructed. However, Hardikar said he has an obligation to consider the benefit to the citizens of  , and not just 8,000-odd residents.
 
 “Hardikar told us he cannot cancel the ramps because of just 8,000 residents’ objections, and that he has to look after the needs of 10 lakh residents,” BJP corporator   said after the meeting.
 
 “The flyover is a huge project being constructed at a cost of Rs 100 crore. We have to consider the benefit of the entire city and not just that of local residents,” msunicipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar told TOI.
 
 The width of the (existing) road is 45 metres, and will be reduced to 5 metres due to the construction of the 27m-wide flyover and the two ramps.
