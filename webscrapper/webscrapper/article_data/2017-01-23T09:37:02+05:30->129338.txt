INDORE: Unlike the mud akhara’s that come alive on few occasions like  , a temporary   a few kilometres away from the main city saw   converge for the event like never before.

 Indoreans who were here to watch the kushti dangal on Sunday were in for a ball with junior-most to national and international-level wrestlers showcasing their grappling skills.
 
 Unlike other dangals, this mega mud wrestling event had a number of children and women among the audience. A separate enclosure for female spectators was made by the organisers, which was packed as the event proceeded.
 
 Many families were seen reaching the venue from various parts of the city.
 
 “My son saw the movie Dangal and since then he has started taking a liking for wrestling. When he came to know about this event, he made sure than we all visited,” said Rakesh Arora, a   among one of the many spectators.
 
 Many parents could be seen carrying their tiny kids on their shoulders so that they could get a glimpse of the traditional Kushti Dangal bouts.
 
 Many local female wrestlers and athletes were also seen keenly watching the event. “I try and attend as many dangals that happen here in Indore but this is the first time I have seen so many people,” said Mahek Yadav, a female athlete from the city.
 
 Though the administration and police department had made elaborate arrangements to handle the crowd, cops had a tough time handling the enthusiastic crowd.
 
 “I had asked a friend of mine who knew the organising committee members to arrange a seat for me but despite that I couldn’t get entry inside the arena,” said Vicky Thakur, another enthusiast.
 
 People were seen arguing with bouncers and cops to get entry inside the arena. Some spectators were trying to sneak in from back entrances.
 
 “Despite a huge turnout we successfully handled the crowd and the event emerged a grand success,” said Dheeraj Thakur, the chief organiser.
