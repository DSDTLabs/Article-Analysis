CHENNAI: Holding that authorities had ‘hurriedly proceeded’ to declare winners in polls for at least 31 cooperative socieites, Madras high court has directed the election officials to consider if fresh elections could be held for those societies. Authorities shall examine the allegations of irregularities levelled by rival candidates for the purpose, said  , on a batch of petitions on Thursday.

 Concurring with the submissions of senior advocate and former additional solicitor-general of India P  , the judge pointed out that already the election officials had cancelled polls to 122 such societies. “This Court is of the view that since the election commission has taken a decision to cancel election to 122 cooperative societies on the report of various irregularities, the commission, being the guardian of democracy and rule of law, shall also take a decision whether they can conduct election in respect of the respective respondent's societies of the aforesaid writ petitions as well, as they have also highlighted various irregularities in rejecting their nomination papers to select the candidates only from particular party,” said Justice Raja.
 
 Tamil Nadu State Cooperative Societies Election Commission issued a notification dated March 12 to hold elections for 18,435 cooperative societies in the state, and nearly two lakh posts are up for the grabs.
 
 Additional advocate-general PH   said it was well settled law that once the election process had commenced, the remedy would be available only before the election tribunal. The petitioners cannot bypass the statutory legal remedy available,   argued.
