 After Bharatiya Janata Party ( ) leadership managed to pull out rebel Krishna Velip from the election race, the party leadership has engineered another feat of uniting ‘Prakash’ to boost its chances in Quepem.
 
   , MGP alliance candidate in Quepem in March 2012 elections, joined BJP on Friday evening .
  
  BJP nominee,   had rebelled and contested as an independent the last time after MGP allotted the ticket to Arjun. This had helped Congress MLA Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar, as he polled 10,998 votes.
  
  “I have joined BJP and will support the party candidate because people are not happy with three-time MLA Kavlekar’s performance,” Arjun said. The BJP nominee urged voters not to succumb to inducements and vote for a well-qualified candidate.
  
  “Kavlekar has sent his wife to Sanguem constituency to contest on a Congress ticket for his selfish interests,” Shanker said.
  
  South Goa MP   said that since they both have united, BJP’s win is almost certain in Quepem.
