LUCKNOW: Another unexplained aspect has surfaced in the case of the death of IAS officer  . The special investigation team comprising four inspectors and a DySP has found more than 25 cigarettes butts in the room where Tewari was staying.

 “PN   maintains he goes to sleep latest by 11.30pm and gets up by 6.30am. On the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, Anurag Tewari and PN Singh were together in room number 19 (of VIP   on  ). It seems unlikely for one person to smoke two dozen cigarettes in one night.   experts can extract DNA profiles from saliva and tell if more than two persons were present in the room,” said a member of the SIT.
 
 On Saturday, a team of experts from Mahanagar forensic laboratory examined the site to reconstruct the crime scene.
 
 SSP   said that findings gathered by SIT will be shared on Sunday evening. “We are examining everything related to the case. On Sunday, I will share the details with everybody,” said Kumar.
 
 Police have been struggling to find a witness who saw Anurag stepping out of guest house or lying on the road.
