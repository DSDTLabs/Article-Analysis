CHENNAI: The southern zone of Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached properties worth 100 crore in cases of   and arrested five people under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the past two months. 

 Officials said more action will follow as they have been given a free hand to dig into the illegal wealth of politicians and businessmen in  . 
 
 In the last fiscal, the directorate was able to provisionally attach 400 crore in assets in Tamil Nadu. 
 
 The central investigative agency has been in the thick of action, handling cases of mining baron Sekhar Reddy, former finance minister  's son Karti   and, of late, former head of   movies S   in the medical seat scam. All have been high-profile cases involving several crores of rupees.
 
 Even the arrest of a comparatively low-profile Chennai-based businessman,  , unearthed money laundering of around 18 crore. ED's Chennai zone has been ranked the best for the past two years and officials have recognised for outstanding performance. 
 
 A senior official said that large-scale corruption has thrived in the state in a casual way owing to the nexus between police and politicians. "Finding evidence in these cases is not difficult," the official said. "Only if the local police file a case of cheating or fraud can we investigate if proceeds of the crime were laundered."
 
 Prevention of Money Laundering Act is a powerful act, as it is cognisable and non-bailable, the official said.
