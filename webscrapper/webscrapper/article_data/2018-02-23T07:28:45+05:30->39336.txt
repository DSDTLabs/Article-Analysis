KESHPUR: His family grieved silently as Chiranjib Hazra was cremated thousands of miles away in Sydney on Thursday. They also wondered whether his last rites were performed properly as they were denied of any glimpse of the send-off. 

 A resident of West Midnapore's Keshpur, Chiranjib went to Australia for his MBA and was working there. He was found dead in his rented room in Sydney on January 26.
 
 After the cremation Chiranjib's brother-in-law -   - called up the funeral service firm. "I wanted to know if things went well. We asked them to send us a video clip or photographs of the cremation on WhatsApp, but were flatly refused,"   told TOI. 
 
 Anup's parents, wife   and son   spent the night sleepless. "Chiranjib was 10 when I married his sister. It's like losing my son," Anup said. The family was numbed by the sequence of events over the last four weeks - the mysterious death, the shraadh on February 10 when they burnt Chiranjib's effigy and the cremation they couldn't even see. Sukanya stared at her brother's pictures which were taken when he was home during the Pujas.
