INDORE: Amid absence of Pakistan in  , Afghanistan came down heavily on 
  in the neighbouring states. Afghanistan even said that if Pakistan does not change its policy, terrorism could become a big threat for itself.

 "Terrorism in South Asia is the biggest and most serious issue where neighbouring countries like Afghanistan as the main sufferer. It has been established that rulers of Pakistan support terrorism openly and the country's policy on terrorism is also not in the interest of other countries of the region. In future terrorism will be a big threat to Pakistan itself," Speaker of Afghanistan Assembly   told TOI.
 
 Ibrahim also express his gratitude toward the Indian Parliament and Inter-Parliamentary Union for inviting Afghanistan to the summit and expected cooperation in combating terrorism in the country. He said the need of international community considering the Paris Agreement, is to focus on improving life of the people, ensuring security, economic development and addressing cultural and environmental issues.
 
 "We can reach SDGs if neighbouring countries work together towards peace and security in the region. Terrorism is a very serious threat to the countries particularly, Afghanistan and we need cooperation from India to improve life of people in Afghanistan and security in political areas," reiterated Ibrahim.
 
 Emphasising long term mutual understanding and good relations with India, he said that India is a big influential country and has always been a friend to Afghanistan. We want to further improve the relations and seek cooperation in different areas.
 
 Pleading ignorance on 
  , Speaker of Sri Lanka parliament, Karu Jayasuriya said, "Terrorism is a big issue and we should have cordial relations among the members. This summit is important in addressing all such issues."
