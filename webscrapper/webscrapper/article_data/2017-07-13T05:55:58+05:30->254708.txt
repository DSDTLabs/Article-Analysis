Noida: The clash at Mahagun Moderne on Wednesday brought to the surface a grouse that simmers beneath the relationship domestic helps share with their employers and the environment in which they go to work.

 “We feel like second-class citizens. We work from morning to evening in various flats but are seldom appreciated,” said Mala, who had joined the crowd that reached the Noida society on Wednesday morning in search of Zohra, the maid who hadn’t returned home after work.
 
 Another maid said she cooks, takes care of elderly persons and also kids at a flat in the society. “But the family members scold me freely if they get upset over anything. All we ask for is a cordial relationship,” she said.
 
 Zohra’s husband   also alleged that  , the wife of the merchant navy officer in whose house she was employed, did not behave well with her. Zohra and Sattar came to Noida 10 years ago from   in  . Sattar works as a mason with a construction company in Greater Noida. Hundreds of men and women who work as domestic helps, labourers or daily wagers had taken a day off to join Sattar in searching for Zohra.
