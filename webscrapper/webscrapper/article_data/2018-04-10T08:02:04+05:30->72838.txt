AHMEDABAD: Police finally acted on complaints from members of eight housing colonies in the   on Monday, arresting three of four putative goons, who had allegedly been intimidating residents. The cops’ actions, however, were not limited to the law or the police manual, as they put the three persons arrested — Ajitsinh Vaghela, Vitthal alias Kaniyo and one more person— to public shaming, taking a procession of the accused, with their hands together “pleading for forgiveness”, through the area.

  Recently, about 700 members of the the housing colonies in question had taken out a rally, alleging harassment and intimidation by these anti-social elements and inaction by police despite several representations by locals.
 
 A local social worker,  , said residents of the area were happy that these accused were put to public shaming and that the cops had finally acted.
 
 Senior police officials denied the allegations that they did not act, saying that they were looking for the accused for a long time but had not been able to catch them.
 
 “On Monday, they got the location of the accused and arrested them. We are also preparing a proposal to invoke the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act ( ) against them. We are also hunting for the two accused who are at large,” added a senior police official. Residents of the locality had taken out a protest rally on Saturday. They had also told police that if action was not taken they would take out a rally to the residence of home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja.
