NEW DELHI: The Delhi University administration is going to sit for another emergent   (EC)   on Monday, this being the second emergent meeting in a week. EC   have pointed out that holding an emergent   meeting instead of a scheduled meeting is deterrent to the functioning of the council as it gives members less time to discuss matters in detail.

 The last emergent meeting was held on Thursday, when the EC had cleared names for the governing bodies of government-funded colleges. This new emergent meeting scheduled for Monday afternoon is planning to address the matter of revised salaries of teachers.
 
 EC member AK Bhagi has written to the VC and pointed out that holding emergent meetings on a short notice will not solve things very much, especially with the agenda for the Monday meeting being just addressing the matters related to pay as compared to all the other issues of teachers raised by EC members. He also claimed that no annexure was provided with the agenda which “keeps me in dark about the recommendations and deliberations of the finance committee”. EC member Rajesh Jha said such emergent meetings were leading to “rubber stamping of university decisions”.
