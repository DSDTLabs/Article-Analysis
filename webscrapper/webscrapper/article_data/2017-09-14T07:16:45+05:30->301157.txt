NEW DELHI: Congress reacted with a sense of relief at the party vice-president  's remark that he was ready to be its prime ministerial candidate in 2019. It was reflected in a tweet by Congress general secretary  .

 Posting Rahul's comments, he tweeted, “Thank God Finally!“ When asked, Singh said, “It is heartening to know that he is fully geared to take up the mantle.He will first become the party president. He will be leading the charge against Prime Minister  .“
 
 The reaction was widely shared by Congress leaders who have long felt that   was reluctant to take up the mantle of leadership. Singh himself has repeatedly said over the last few years that Rahul should become the party president and present himself as the PM candidate in the Lok Sabha elections.
 
 In an interaction at University of California in   on Tuesday, Rahul said he was ready to become Congress chief but added it would come at the end of ongoing organisational polls.
