MUMBAI: Maharashtra   chief and former chief minister   on Thursday declined to comment on Narayan Rane’s frontal attack against him. “I never discuss internal party matters in public. My best wishes are with him,” Chavan said.

 Anticipating that Rane would quit the Congress, Chavan had dissolved the Rane-controlled by Sindhudurg Congress committee and all block level committees and appointed Vikas Sawant to lead the party.
 
 Following Chavan’s reaction, Rane’s son Nitesh and Congress legislator Kalidas Kolambkar did not attend Rane’s public meeting and media briefing so as not to invite a rap and disqualification for anti-party activities.
 
 A senior Congress leader said there are no takers for Rane’s contention that he was assured that he would be considered for the chief minister’s post. “In the last 12 years, Rane has not understood style of working of Congress, particularly Sonia Gandhi. There is nothing like an assurance in the Congress,” he said.
 
  spokesperson Nawab Malik hit out at Rane, calling him hungry for power. “The Congress gave him a ministerial berth and made him a member of the legislative council. When his party is out of power, this greedy man, who cannot live without power, is knocking on BJP’s doors. The question is whether the   will accept him or will he become another Shankersinh Vaghela,” Malik said.
 
 A former BJP minister said Rane’s entry was under consideration, but he quit the party before any decision could be taken. “Talks were going on with Rane, but no decision was taken. Now since he has left Congress, it will be difficult to accommodate him,” he said.
