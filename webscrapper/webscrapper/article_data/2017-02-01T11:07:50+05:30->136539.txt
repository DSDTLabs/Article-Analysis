BHOPAL: One person was killed and 13 passengers were injured after a bus overturned near Rerua village under Nagaud police station of   district on Tuesday afternoon.

 The bus that was coming from Panna and headed for Satna overturned at around 1 pm. 
 
 “The deceased has been identified as Dhirendra Dwivedi, a resident of Rara village of Satna. His body was trapped inside the vehicle as he was probably sitting near the gate.

 After receiving information of the accident, senior police officials, including Satna superintendent of police Mithlesh Shukla, had rushed to the spot. 
 
 Parihar added, “A girl aged around 17 years sustained severe injuries and was admitted to the district hospital. Moreover, around 12 other passengers received minor injuries in the accident. Prima facie, a case of causing death by negligence has been registered against the driver of the bus and investigations are going on.”
 
 “If any issue with the permit of the bus is found during the probe, then case will be registered against the vehicle owner too,” Parihar said.
 
 The bus was carrying around 50 passengers and overturned while taking a turn towards Satna. The accident spot is located around 10 kilometres from Nagaud town.
 
 Sources, however, said that the bus did not have valid permit. Incidentally, an application for getting its permit was recently forwarded to transport officials.
