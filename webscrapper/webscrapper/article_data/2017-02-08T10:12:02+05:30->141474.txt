AHMEDABAD: A Ghatlodia resident recently got a call to verify if his debit card was used to make purchase at a city mall. Alarmed, he checked his card and it was very much with him. He informed the caller that he had not made the said transaction. To block the transaction, the caller asked him for the card number and it’s CVV (three-digit code on back of the card) for verification.

 The caller also asked him for the verification code sent to his mobile phone. The case registered with city police’s cyber cell says that the same information was used to withdraw more than Rs 50,000 from the man’s bank account.
 
  As the world observed Safer Internet Day on Tuesday, cyber cell officials said that over the years the tricks used by online fraudsters have changed significantly. 
 
 Even the infamous ‘Nigerian scam’ has undergone a transformation.
 
 Deepan Bhadran, DCP (crime), said that the past year has seen cyber crime cases both at personal and institutional level. The cyber cell had busted the multi-crore call centre scam and had also nabbed Nigerian nationals trying to blackmail a woman on a matrimonial website.
 
 “The current challenges include various forms of phishing and malware attacks. 
 
 The fraudsters keep updating their modus operandi as knowledge remains the best defence against such frauds,” he said.
 
 Rajdeepsinh Zala, ACP (crime), said the complaints received in the last year included frauds where gullible victims were asked to buy seeds or chemicals by callers based abroad, promising good returns.
 
 “A major area of concern is  . As the thrust is now on digital payments, we are trying to educate citizens on how to remain safe. Check the mobile application properties before download and use only trusted payment gateways,” he said.
