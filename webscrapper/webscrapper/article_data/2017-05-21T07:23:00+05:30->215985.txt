AMRITSAR: After the kidnapping of a doctor on Thursday night in Ajnala, the medical fraternity here is a distraught lot. They are so shaken that instead of depending entirely on the state government for providing them protection cover, majority of them prefer making their own   and avoid moving out during odd hours.

 Gangsters in disguise as patients accosted Dr Manish Sharma, who runs a hospital at Ajnala, near Rajasansi and kidnapped him on Thursday night . He was set free only after his wife allegedly paid a ransom of Rs 7.5 lakh.
 
 Dr Gurbilas, a consultant in gastroenterology and herpetology, said the kidnapping had disturbed the medical fraternity. Having braved a murderous attack last year, Gurbilas said since then he had stopped driving car by himself and had hired a driver and a private gunman. “There is very little a doctor can do for his own security,” he maintained.
 
 Stating that the recent incident of kidnapping of a doctor had once again reminded him of the days of terrorism, cardiologist Dr Arun Chopra said doctors had to take call during emergency even in odd hours but in an increasingly insecure environment they would have to think twice before going somewhere, adding that hospital managements should come forward in extending security cover to doctors.
 
 A leading medical professional, who didn’t want to give his name for security reasons, said the doctors were already on the radar of extortionists, kidnappers and other gangsters. Despite police claims of curbing crime, he said it was on the rise and the recent incident backed this. Stating that doctors like him were very apprehensive about their security, he said effective policing and private security was the only answer to their safety.
