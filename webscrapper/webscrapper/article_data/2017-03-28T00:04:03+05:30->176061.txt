Nashik: The much-awaited ‘Make in Nashik’ event finds a slot in the calendar as the dates for it have been finalised for May 30 and 31.

 The event, to be held at the Nehru Centre in  , will be jointly organised by the city-based industries and the state government in a bid to attract new investments for Nashik. 
 
 The dates for the event were finalised after the consent of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who will also inaugurate the event.
 
 Uday Kharote, secretary of Nashik Industries & Manufacturers’ Association (NIMA), said, “The ‘Make in Nashik’ event will be held on May 30 and 31 at the Nehru Centre in Mumbai. We will soon finalise the agenda of the two-day event and the list of large industries that will be invited. Our objective is to fetch maximum large investment in Nashik with the support from the state government.”
 
 In the last 15 years, not a single large industry has come to Nashik even though the industrial sector has a investment potential. The chief minister has his commitment of adopting Nashik after the BJP has emerged as the single largest party with majority. So, the industries are positive about large investments and are expecting a huge industrial investment during the   event. 
 
 Due to lack of political leadership, the industrial sector in Nashik is already deprived of large investments. This was also experienced during the ‘Make in India’ event, held in Mumbai in February last year where Nashik was sidelined for investments.
