Colva: Friday’s tourist taxi strike saw local hoteliers pulling out all stops to ensure a convenient commute for their guests. The son of a former minister from South Goa was among them. 

 When TOI spotted the man waiting by an unmanned autorickshaw at 12.30pm, he said his guests needed transport to go sightseeing and that he was hunting for a rickshaw for them. Eventually disclosing that he was the son of a former state minister and ran a hotel along Salcete’s coastal belt, the man said that earlier in the day, he himself had made five   from the hotel to the airport, four to the railway station and two to the KTC bus terminus at Margao just to pick and drop his guests. tnn
