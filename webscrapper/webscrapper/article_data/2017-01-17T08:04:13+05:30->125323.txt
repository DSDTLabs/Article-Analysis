RAJKOT: Frustrated over  , people of Ambardi village in  , on Monday opposed 'Gunotsav', a drive to evaluate quality of education imparted in government schools. Monday was the first day of the drive. 

 Adults from the village sat in classrooms with placards saying 'teach us how to live without money' when government officials arrived to assess the students. Moreover, the school going children were sent to banks to stand in queues and withdraw cash. 
 
 Ambardi has a population of over 8,000 with three banks including that of country's biggest lender  .
 
 On Monday, villagers took out a rally at 10.30 am when two government officers from Savarkundla town came to evaluate the quality of education in village primary school.
 
 Villagers went and sat in the classrooms with placard around their necks. "We asked the teachers to teach us how to live without cash since government is unable to supply enough cash to banks," said  , a farmer from Ambardi.
 
 "Whenever we go to banks, they say that they do not have cash. Even after two months, we are finding it difficult to return to normalcy," Malani added.
 
 Since none of the children attended the school, the government officials returned without evaluation as villagers were not in mood to cooperate, said Malani.
