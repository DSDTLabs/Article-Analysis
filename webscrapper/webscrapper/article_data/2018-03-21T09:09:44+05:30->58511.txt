JAIPUR: The adage ‘for the women, by the women and of the women’ is literally becoming true at the upcoming government girls college in  .

 State higher education department has claimed to have probably the first of its kind college which will employ women as its teaching and nonteaching staff. It means that from peons to a principal and from security guards to sweepers, all will be women.
 
 
 State higher education minister   says that this college will redefine a girl college. “The larger goal of this move is women’s empowerment. The department is expecting to increase the gross enrolment ratio of the city and region with the opening of this college,” said Maheshwari.
 
 The college is open on the pilot basis at Kota. The success of this college will see opening of more such colleges. “In the coming years, allwomen college will start in other divisional headquarters,” said Maheshwari.
 
 The college will have all streams along with shortterm courses making students employable. The selfdefence training is made integral part of the academic year.
 
 The dedicated colleges may have become a passe in the country but   has a brief history and present of schools and colleges for girls. The patriarchal society in Rajasthan makes the survival of dedicated institutions easy. Country’s probably the biggest girls’ college and university, Maharani’s College and  , respectively, is in the state.
