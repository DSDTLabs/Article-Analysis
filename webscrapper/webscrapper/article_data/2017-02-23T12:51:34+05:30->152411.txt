VISAKHAPATNAM: Government doctors from the city complained that their January salary has not been released due to certain issues at the district treasury. The doctors pointed out that they haven’t got any specific assurance about the salary from the finance department.

 Government doctors including assistant professors, associate professors and professors have been facing this problem. Already, salary was being delayed by a few days in the previous months and the January salary is yet to reach the doctors. Around 200 government doctors are getting affected by this delay in disbursement.
 
 State secretary of   (APGDA) Dr   said, “The salary for January has not reached us still. When we enquired about it with the district treasury office, we were told that there has been a freeze in the government level due to overdraft, that is the input received by the government has been less than the expenditure and therefore the government is not in a position to disburse the salaries.”
 
 Dr Jayadheer further said members of APGDA have also contacted the finance department of AP government at the secretariat. “We were told that the issue would be resolved but nothing was made clear to us, nor any definite time was stated about releasing our salaries, which is a right of every working individual,” said the state secretary.
