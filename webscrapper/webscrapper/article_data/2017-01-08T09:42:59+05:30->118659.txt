NEW DELHI: Swashbuckling Tweeter and former opening bat   had Twitter in splits yesterday again after his comment on a news story in Emirates247.com which mistook Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput for Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

  The former, incidentally, played the latter in a biopic, so one could perhaps be a little more forgiving. But like his bat, Viru's humour spares no one.
 
 The news story was about   becoming India’s new limited overs captain, following Dhoni’s resignation from that post. The story featured a picture of Kohli’s. And next to that was a picture of Rajput’s, or Dhoni’s, depending on whether you like your cricket served reel or real. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Then came Sehwag’s killer tweet, below, which says it all. (We’ll forgive him for mistaking Emirates247.com for  .)
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Twitter couldn’t get enough of it.
 
 This Tweeter couldn’t stop, well, laughing.
 
 
  
  
 
 This social media user said   is “rare”. He is, he is.
 
 
  
  
 
 And this Tweeter suggested an alternate career for the one and only Viru.
