Mumbai: Badlapur resident   (28) intended to leave for his hometown in   in a year to avoid risky commute on Mumbai’s local trains. The Badlapur resident’s worst fears came true on Friday, for he was among the 22 who died in the stampede at   station bridge. He is survived by his wife and a two-year-old child. 

 The accountant with a private company in Elphinstone Road had gotten off the   at Parel when it began to pour. “He might have taken shelter on the bridge (which connects Parel with Elphinstone) while waiting for the downpour to subside,” said a colleague. 
 
 Chandan’s uncle Subhash Singh (in pic), who reached KEM Hospital to claim the body, said, “I called Chandan’s father in Satna (Madhya Pradesh) and told him of an accident. However, he himself asked whether his son was alive or….” 
 
 “It was a shock for him,” added Subhash in between sobs. Avdhesh Singh, Chandan’s father, has left for the city. 
 
 Avdhesh wanted Chandan to settle in Bhopal, which is around 450km from Satna. “Avdhesh always felt that Mumbai was a fast city and travelling by crowded trains is life-threatening. He kept begging his son to leave Mumbai and recently Chandan too fell in line with the idea. He wanted to save before leaving the city for good.”
