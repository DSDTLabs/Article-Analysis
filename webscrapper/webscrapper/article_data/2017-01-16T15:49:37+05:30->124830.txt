ALANGANALLUR: Alanganallur in   failed to keep date with jallikattu for the third consecutive year on Monday due to the Supreme Court ban on the bull-taming sport and measures taken by police to thwart any attempt to hold it. 

 All roads led to this small town in Madurai district as thousands of people from across the state came here to express solidarity with the local people.
 
 Tension prevailed in the town. People who were visiting Alanganallur for the first time were eager to see the “Vaadivasal’ which is the gateway to the jallikattu arena. However, police didn’t allow them to visit the area. 
 
 Shops remained closed as a mark of protest. Black flags were hoisted outside houses and shops. 
 
 Wearing black flags on their dresses, the protesters took out a rally. Chairman of the Jallikattu Peravai P Rajasekhar, musician Adhi and film director Amir were among those participated in the rally. 
 
 People shouted slogans demanding that the central and state government take steps to enable conduct of jallikattu. They shouted slogans against People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).   is one of the organisations on whose petition the Supreme Court imposed the ban on jallikattu. They shouted that political parties should never come to Alanganallur seeking votes.
 
 The rally was going on when this report was filed.
