PUNE: With the standing committee of the   approving a parking policy for the city, the civic administration is all set to conduct a detailed survey to identify the plots which can be developed as   lots.

 The civic body has plans to develop nearly 35 plots as parking lots in various parts of the city. Some of the plots have already been reserved in the DP (development plan) while a few more would be identified from the amenity spaces available with the municipal corporation. The provision of additional parking lots is expected to streamline traffic management and avoid   of vehicles on roads.
  
  
 Civic officials said that provision of parking lots was among the several measures proposed in the parking policy. The parking policy proposes charges for parking of vehicles along the roads and at the designated public parking lots.
 
 Standing committee chairman   said the parking policy was not limited to imposing charges. “Steps are being taken to increase parking infrastructure in the city. The administration is expected to submit its report on parking lots to the standing committee in the next one month. We will study the report and discuss it with other stakeholders on how the parking lots can be developed to accommodate maximum number vehicles,” he added.
 
 The civic body has built parking lots in the city’s central areas, but all these facilities are already proving insufficient and are always fully occupied. Sources in the administration said the parking issue has been neglected for many years now. Many plots have been earmarked for parking lots but have not been developed so far. 
 
 Meanwhile, the civic administration has said that it was yet to identify parking zones. “The zones would be identified in the second stage of implementation of the parking policy along with the observations of the traffic police department on the demand for parking,” an official said.
