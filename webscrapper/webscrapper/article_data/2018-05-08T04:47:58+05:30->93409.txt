MUMBAI: Maharashtra has received a total of 240 post-graduate medical seats from the central counselling round after no takers were found for the same. 

 The   (DMER) allotted 50% of these seats to the open category and the remaining half to various quotas. Meanwhile, students who were allotted seats in private colleges but cannot afford the new tuition fee plan to write to the CET commissioner and the DMER. 
 
 Several private medical colleges did not participate in the first admission round as they demanded they be allowed to charge management and NRI quota students on a par. After the month-long stalemate ended, the colleges agreed to the state’s 1:4:5 fee formula under which merit students will pay fees decided by the  , management students will pay four times that fee and NRI candidates will cough up five times the merit seat fee. 
 
 Of the 11 private institutes, as TOI had reported, only a few colleges like Kashibai Navale and ACPM, Dhule, admitted students during round one after making them sign an undertaking that if fees rise, they would have to shell out more money. 
 
 Only other hospitals like Bombay Hospital, Sancheti in Pune, Sangli’s Sanjeevani and Swastiyog in Miraj admitted post-graduate candidates. “We were not allowed to alter our choices and now, we cannot afford the new high fees,” said a student. Some of them were contemplating moving court. “Students facing affordability issues can write to the CET commissioner regarding the same and the matter can be taken up on a case to case basis,” said Dr Pravin Shingare, head of the DMER.
