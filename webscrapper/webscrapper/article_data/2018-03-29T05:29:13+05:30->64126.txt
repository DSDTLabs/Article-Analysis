MUMBAI: Bits of paper found in a   accident victim’s pocket were used by a team of railway policemen to establish his identity and track down his family in Nepal. As his family is extremely poor, the   not only helped them conduct the victim’s   but also arranged   to travel back home. 

 Ithvaria Tharu had come to Maharashtra in December last year looking for work. His wife and four children live with his aged mother in Nepal. Tharu had found work in a Chinese fast food stall in Mumbai. After working there for some days, he learnt of a work opportunity in a Ratnagiri-based hotel. He was to travel to Ratnagiri for the job and had even booked a ticket in a long-distance train. But before he could head to Konkan, Tharu fell off a crowded local train between Andheri and Vile Parle stations recently and was seriously injured. The GRP rushed him to a public hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. 
 
 The police could not find any ID card on Tharu. He was only carrying the long-distance train ticket. The police then found bits of paper in his pocket and pieced them together. A phone number had been scribbled on them. Police officers dialled the number and found it belonged to an employee of the Ratnagiri hotel. Police obtained the hotel owner’s number and sent him Tharu’s picture for identification. He showed it to all his staffers, one of whom knew Tharu. He provided Tharu’s name and native address to cops. The GRP then dialled the panchayat samiti of Tharu’s village in Nepal who in turn informed his family.
 
 “The family was too poor to come to Mumbai and take Tharu’s remains back home. After a lot of convincing from us, the family somehow arranged for money to reach Mumbai several days after the accident. They had no idea where Tharu lived in Mumbai. We helped them conduct the funeral and also helped arrange tickets so they could go back home,” said an Andheri GRP officer.
