BENGALURU: Every day, 6,000 Bengalureans fly to Delhi from   (KIA). Data analysed by the   (DGCA) shows that from KIA, this was most congested route in January 2017, with 1.76 lakh passengers flying out.

 Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Pune are the top five cities Bengalureans fly to, the data shows. The DGCA combines data of passengers travelling by various airlines to and fro major destinations in the country on a monthly basis.Going by this, there are 13 major destinations to where Bengalureans take off the most, of which Delhi and Mumbai have always had about 1.3 to 1.5 lakh flyers from the city every month since August 2015.
 
 Sanjeev  , an urban mobility expert who compiled the data from DGCA, said: “If we compile and calculate the data and average it out on a daily ba sis, 6,000 people fly to Delhi, 5,000 to Mumbai, 2,700 to Hyderabad, 2,500 to Kolkata and 2,000 to Pune.“
 
 Sanjeev says daily ridership by trains to the same destinations would be lesser.“Given that there are only three daily trains to Delhi and two weekly ones, and 80% of seats are reserved from Bengaluru, only 3,850 seats are bookedpeople travel to Delhi from Bengaluru daily. Even for Mumbai there are only three direct trains departing from Bengaluru city daily, offering only about 1,800-odd seats,“ said Sanjeev after collating and studying the data from DGCA and Railways.
 
 Pairing cities
 
 KIA officials say the numbers are high also because airlines pair cities to and fro Bengaluru such that these five cities serve as connecting points to other remote destinations across the country. Jet Airways and   have the largest market share in KIA and have higher number of cities paired from Bengaluru.
