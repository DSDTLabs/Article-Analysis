PANAJI: Stating that the civil polls in the state are not fought on party lines,   mentor   on Sunday said that his party would not be backing any candidates in the upcoming panchayat elections. 

 “I have always been a proponent of not having civic elections on party lines. There should be freedom of choice to the people. The party would not support any candidates in the upcoming elections,” Sardesai said. 
 
 The   also hinted that his party would maintain a similar stand on the   elections by stating that Goa Forward is a regional party. “We are a regional party and our aim is to put the state forward. We are technically members of the national democratic alliance (NDA). We haven’t discussed about the BJP’s potential candidates for the Rajya Sabha seats and will be reaching to a decision soon,” he said. 
 
 The town and country planning minister also reiterated that the common minimum program, agreed with the BJP, is on course. 
 
 “We have already moved files to make the coconut tree as the state tree. The mere announcement of the common minimum program is a formality as we are already implementing it. We are trying to protect the state through it,” he said. 
 
 The minister also put his weight behind the soon to be implemented goods and services tax, stating that the country as a whole would benefit from the one tax policy in the long run. 
 
 “The GST would benefit Goa as it is a consumer market state. There are some doubts for which GST council is there. There will be some initial hiccups, but it is a landmark legislation which will disturb the status quo. In the long run, it will benefit the country,” he said.
