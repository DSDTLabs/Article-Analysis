TRICHY: Dismissing claims that the evaluation process has been affected by teachers’ protests,   K A Sengotttaiyan has said that the results of various examination would be out on time and no teachers were on protest. 

 Speaking on the sidelines of an inspection at the NEET residential coaching centres set up by the state government for class 12 students in   on Friday, he said that the government had given strict instructions to schools to not conduct any summer classes. While asking people to bring it to the notice of his department if they came across schools conducting summer classes, he however said that students of class 12 were an exception as they had to prepare for competitive examinations. 
 
 Saying that no state in the country was giving coaching in competitive exam for students, he said that teachers would be trained as per the new curriculum that the government would be introducing for class 1, 6, 9 and 11 to effectively teach the students. The minister said that class 1 students would be exposed to air and water management. Besides, they would also be educated on traffic rules.
 
 In order to equip students of government and aided schools in the state to take up competitive exams, the school education department started residential coaching for select students at nine centres across the state. Amidst charges that the present curriculum followed in the state board schools didn’t equip students to take up central competitive exams including NEET, the government has introduced the residential crash course across the state.
