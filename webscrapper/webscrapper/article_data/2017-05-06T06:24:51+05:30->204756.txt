PATNA: The Muzaffarpur district and sessions judge on Friday rejected the bail petitions of three accused in the case of murder of   in Siwan.

 The journalist was shot at   under the Town police station area in Siwan district on May 13 last year while he was returning home at night. 
 
 Former RJD MP and Siwan strongman Mohd Shahabuddin’s name cropped up as a conspirator during police investigation into the case. Shahabuddin at that time was lodged in the Siwan district jail while Laddan, who earlier worked as Shahabuddin’s henchman, had come out of the jail few days before the murder.
 
 Amid public outcry, the   government handed over the investigation into the case to the CBI in September.
 
 Talking to TOI over the phone, CBI counsel  , said Muzafarpur DJ H N Tiwari rejected the bail petitions of conspirator   alias Azaharuddin Beg, assailant Rohit Kumar Soni and his accomplice Sonu Kumar Soni.
 
 “Laddan had given a pistol and six live cartridges to the killers along with Rs 15,000,” Khan said, adding Rohit shot Rajdeo after mobike-borne Sonu stopped the journalist.
 
 “Forensic report has confirmed that the three cartridges recovered from Rajdeo’s body during autopsy had been fired from the pistol that was recovered on the basis of confessional statements of the assailants,” the counsel said and added the CBI probe was still on.
