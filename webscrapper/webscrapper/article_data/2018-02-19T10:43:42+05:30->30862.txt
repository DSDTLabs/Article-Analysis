Indore: Over 230 forest workers went a   on Sunday raising several demands related to their working hours,  , and parity with police officers etc. Also, as many as 150   reached Bhopal to stage protest along with other forest staff from across the state. 

 The police officers have eight hour shifts, whereas the forest guards and foresters have to be on duty for 24 hours. There is difference between their pay also since they are paid much less than police officials, said the protesters.
 
 “We also do not get our transport, medical and uniform allowances, on time. We do not have the right to use guns. Government has purchased guns for us but we are not trained to use them,” said Prakash Vajpai of  . 
 
 The workers have also raised the issue that often senior officials engage the field staff in their personal errands or with office work, as a result of which forests are not being protested properly. “Forest fires, encroachments, hunting activities, and felling of trees become frequent due to this. We have sought of filling up of vacancies so that the field staff does not have to sit in office,” said the association district president  .
 
 The forest department said that they were looking into their demands and proposal of parity between police and forest officials had been submitted for approval before the government. 
 
 “The promotions have also been halted due to some litigation pending before the Supreme Court. But apart from this, we are listening to all their demands and we are meeting them as per the availability of resources,” said PCCF Animesh Shukla.
