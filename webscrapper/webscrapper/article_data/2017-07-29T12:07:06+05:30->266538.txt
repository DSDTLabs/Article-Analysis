VADODARA: M S University’s syndicate meeting turned stormy on Friday as university vice-chancellor (VC) professor   and his supporters, who are now being referred as his ‘kitchen cabinet’, continued their efforts to silence their detractors. 

 Government-nominated syndicate member Tejal Amin even walked out of the meeting after heated arguments.
 
 Sources suggest that Amin had questioned the university’s move of deleting the dissent registered by four syndicate members on the university’s decision of barring professor Umesh Dangarwala for a period of five years from any executive post. 
 
 Vyas and the syndicate members, who support him not only argued in favour of their decision of deleting the dissent registered by the four members, but in a veiled threat even asked government-nominated syndicate member   and VC nominated syndicate member professor   not to share the decisions taken by the syndicate members with the media, sources said. 
 
 Both Mehta and Sengupta have openly highlighted the alleged irregularities of university administration and the ‘cartel’ in the university’s syndicate body that supports the administration. 
 
 The members of the ruling group which enjoys majority in the syndicate body are upset with Mehta and Sengupta openly expressing their opinions on a number of decisions that the body has taken in the recent past. 
 
 The syndicate members also cleared promotions of as many as 22 teachers including university’s registrar Dr Neerja Jaiswal, the head of the Department of Family and Community Resource Management at Faculty of Family and Community Science, who has been promoted as professor now.
 
 Ahead of the meeting, the Federation of All MSU Employees Organizations including office-bearers of Baroda University Teachers Association, Baroda University Staff Association and the Maharaja Sayajirao Vishyavidyalay Shaikshik Sangh had made a joint representation with a list of demands before the syndicate members.
