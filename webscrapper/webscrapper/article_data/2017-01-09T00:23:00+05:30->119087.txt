PUNE: D K Sharma, general manager,  , on Saturday said that introduction of EMU (electric multiple unit) rakes on Pune-Daund section would take more time as it was a ‘major policy decision’ requiring lot of work. Instead, MEMU ( ) trains will be introduced after railway ministry approves it. It means that commuters travelling between Lonavla and Daund will not get direct connectivity and will still have to change trains at Pune station. 

 A proposal to procure at least six MEMU trains has been sent to the railway board by the Central Railway. Authorities, however, said they were not sure as to when the rakes will arrive.
 
 More than 30,000 people, who travel daily on the section, have been demanding more trains to ensure faster travel. Commuters who travel in shuttle and passenger trains claimed that services were not adequate to cater to the increasing number of passengers.
 
 Later, Sharma unveiled the heritage steam locomotive in DRM’s office concourse. The locomotive is christened ‘Anuradha’, meaning ‘goddess of luck’, by B K Dadabhoy, divisional railway manager. This locomotive was imported in India in 1955 and it successfully rendered service for 31 years from May 1955 to June 1986.
