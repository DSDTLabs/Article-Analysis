NEW DELHI: The three corporations in the city, ‘in effect’, got their new mayors on Wednesday. While Janakpuri counsellor Narender Chawla is likely to be the   of the south   for the next one year, Adesh Kumar Gupta from West Patel Nagar and Bipin Bihar Singh from Patparganj are expected to lead the north and east corporations, respectively. 

 Wednesday was the last day for filing the nominations for the top post in each corporation after the completion of the first-year cycle of the five-year tenure of the current House. As the ruling   holds a clear majority in all three corporations, its nominations are likely to be final. 
 
 Nominations were also filed to elect the deputy mayor and half of the standing committee posts. The elections will be held on April 27. Satyapal Malik, Rajesh Lawadia and Kiran Vaid will become the deputy mayors of the south, north and east corporations, respectively. 
 
 While Kamal Jeet Sehrawat (Dwarka), the mayor of the south corporation, will become the new leader of the House (LOH), north corporation mayor Preety Agarwal and her east corporation counterpart, Neema Bhagat, have been kept away from any top post in the second year. 
 
 The announcement was made early in the morning by Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari. They would work on the signature campaign, MCD Aapke Dwar (MCD at your dooesteps), and resolving the problems of Delhiites, he said.
