LUCKNOW: A 15-year-old girl suffering from a rare congenital medical condition called choledochal cyst was successfully treated by a team of surgeons in King George’s   ( ) who operated upon her through laparoscopy, a first for the surgery department.

 The girl from   had been suffering pain and recurrent jaundice and fever due to choledochal cyst or bile duct cyst in common terms. She was successfully treated through a five-hour laparoscopic surgery without any charge. The surgery, doctors said, would have cost between Rs 2-Rs 3 lakhs in a private hospital.
 
 
 The disease, experts said is generally treated through an open surgery in which deep and long incisions have to be made. The girl has been discharged from the hospital. “Both the disease and the method we used to treat it are rare. Generally, an open surgery is performed in such a case with three incisions being made. But since the patient was a young girl, we thought it would be better to do it through laparoscopy. It is a technically demanding option and the process used, called Roux-en-Y reconstruction, is not a simple procedure to connect the duct either. But we did it successfully,” said Dr Awanish  , associate professor, surgery department, who led the team.
 
 Dr Kumar said that the surgery eliminated three incisions that would have been made otherwise, and the recovery was also early. In the disease, he said, a lump can be felt in the stomach, with jaundice and recurrent fever as symptoms.
