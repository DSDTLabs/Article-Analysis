NEW DELHI: Starting with the 2019-20 academic session, students seeking admission under the 25% quota for economically weaker sections and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) will have a lower upper   than the current year.

 The admission notification released by the directorate of education ( ) on Wednesday stated that for the 2019-20 session, the upper age limit will be four years for  , five years for KG and six years for Class I under the EWS/DG quota. The 2018-19 session will follow last year’s precedent of five, six and seven years for nursery, KG and Class I, respectively.
 
 “With a view to provide adequate notice/time to the parents/guardians to plan for the admission of their wards and in light of the direction of the high court vide its order dated January 20, 2017 in WP(C) 408/2017 and WP(C) 409/2017, it has been decided to implement the upper age limit with effect from 2019-20,” read the notification.
 
 The notification referred to an older order released on December 18, 2015 in which the upper limit was fixed at four years for nursery, five years for KG and six years for Class I.
 
 Senior officials said that this year the high court allowed DoE to impose an upper age limit notified in 2015, but the department decided to delay its implementation for a year to avoid hassle to parents. “The court gave the order in November. As it is too close to the admission process, we decided to implement it from next year,” said an official.
 
 While the notification does not specifically mention relaxation for children with mental disabilities, senior DoE officials said that school principals have been given the authority to choose on case-to-case basis and decide on admission.
