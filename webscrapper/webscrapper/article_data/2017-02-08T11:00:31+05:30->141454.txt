People who consistently smoke less than one cigarette a day (but more than zero) still have a higher   than those who've never smoked, according to a JAMA Internal Medicine study.

 Data was gathered with a questionnaire assessing lifetime cigarette smoking history. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were determined for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality through the end of 2011. Roughly 300,000 adults aged 59–82 completed questionnaires about their lifetime smoking histories. During a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, 13% of participants died. Compared with people who never smoked, those who reported consistently smoking less than 1 or 1–10 cigarettes a day had higher risks for all-cause mortality (hazard ratios, 1.64 and 1.87). People who used to smoke at these levels but who quit still had elevated mortality risks relative to non-smokers, but the risks were lower than those of current  .
 
 This study provides evidence that individuals who smoke fewer than 1 or 1 to 10 CPD over their lifetime have higher mortality risks than non-smokers and would benefit from cessation. These results provide further evidence that there is no risk-free level of exposure to tobacco smoke.
