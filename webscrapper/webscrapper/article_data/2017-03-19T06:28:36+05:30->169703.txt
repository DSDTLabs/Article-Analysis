AHMEDABAD: Gurukul was tense on Saturday as   officials along with police personnel arrived and demolished the extension of the  , which lies in the middle of the road. But initially people had prevented the   team from carrying out the demolition. 

 The AMC said that it had received complaints that the temple caused traffic jams in the area. 
 
 The AMC had targeted only the extension of the temple. Even so, police had a tough time managing the crowd. 
 
 A man who owns a shop near the temple said that the AMC should shift the structure to one side. Such an operation was successful at SAL Hospital crossroads near the Sai Baba temple where the temple of Anjanamata was moved from the middle of the crossroads.
 
 In September 2009, the apex court had ruled that no unauthorized construction shall be permitted in the name of a temple, church, mosque or a gurudwara on public streets or parks. As for religious structures that had already been constructed without authorization, the court said that state administrations should review them on a case-to-case basis and take appropriate action.
