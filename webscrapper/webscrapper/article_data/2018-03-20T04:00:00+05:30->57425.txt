Rajkot: Deeply depressed over her kids’ deaths, a 37-year-old woman committed suicide by consuming poison at her residence in Parimal Society of Palitana in Bhavnagar district on Monday morning. Police identified the deceased as Reshma Qureshi. 

 Reshma’s two children — son Jiyan (6) and daughter Afrin (8 ) — had gone missing after they had left for their school on September 6 last year. On September 8 last year, the bodies of both the kids were found from the boot of a car in Sipai Jamat ni Wadi near Parimal Society. 
 
 Though police had registered the case as an accidental death as the postmortem report of the kids cited asphyxiation as the cause for their deaths, Reshma claimed that her kids had been murdered and accused police of negligence. 
 
 “Reshma had been suffering from depression ever since the death of her children. The postmortem report of the children did not reveal any signs of injuries. It was believed that the kids had locked themselves up inside the boot of the car while playing and were asphyxiated to death. Hence, we ruled out the possibility of a foul play,” an official from Palitana police station said.
