SHIMLA: A   aimed at connecting Baijnath region of Kangra district with Bharmaur region of Chamba district and reducing distance by around 140km has been hanging fire for the last around 10 years. All these years the tunnel project has remained only on papers but now hopes have risen once again with chief minister   promising to provide partial funds in the coming   and directing officials to prepare a detailed project report.

 Construction of the Holi-Uttrala tunnel has been a long-pending demand of the area. The tunnel will largely benefit the Gaddi community residing in the higher reaches of Bharmaur and Baijnath. During his visit to Baijnath on Sunday, Jai Ram directed to incorporate Holi-Uttrala tunnel project under   priority. He assured that the distance between Baijnath in Kangra and Holi in Chamba would be reduced.
 
 During the previous BJP regime in 2008, the Holi-Uttrala tunnel project was conceived. The 7 km-long tunnel project would cost about Rs 1,571 crore and reduce distance between Holi in Chamba district and   in Baijnath subdivision of Kangra district by 140km. The tunnel is to be constructed underneath Jalsu Jot, which will ensure an all-weather shorter route to   area of Chamba district from Baijnath.
 
 In December 2013, the   gave approval to consultancy service for a detailed feasibility study and preparation of a detailed project report but after that no further progress was seen. Sources in government said on completion the traffic tunnel would not only provide an all-weather connectivity between the two districts but would also boost tourism activity in the region. They said that to reach the tunnel point at Holi in Bharmaur there was a need to construct around 12 km of the stretch.
