Singer   says he may not have changed that much after becoming famous as much as his popularity changed people around him. 

  The 26-year-old musician says money accompanied with fame often messes up lives. 
 
  
  
 "It (fame) changed the people around me more than it changed me. And that in turn changes you because when the people around you change towards you, you can get very paranoid. Fame is a weird thing," says Sheeran. 
 
 The 'Shape of You' singer adds he would rather use his money and fame to support his near and dear ones and the causes which are close to his heart. 
 
 "I have more value on my friends and family being OK. A lot of my money goes to charity or to children's hospitals near where I live," he says.
