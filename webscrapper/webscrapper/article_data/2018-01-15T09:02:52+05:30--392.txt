KOZHIKODE: KSRTC managing director A Hemachandran has sought a report from executive director (vigilance) on the callous and inhuman act by   service buscrew, who refused to stop the vehicle for a 17-year-old girl student travelling at night to alight at her home town.

 The trip turned an ordeal for the teen, daughter of K C Abdul   of   near  , who along with her friend boarded the bus from   at 8.30pm on Friday. She was returning home after attending entrance coaching class. 
 
 Her father was supposed to reach Kozhikode bus stand to pick her up, but after coming to know that the bus was heading to   he asked her to get down at Payyoli. When she told the conductor that she had to get down at Payyoli, he said the next stop was only at Kannur and asked her to buy another ticket, which she did.
 
 After she informed her father over phone that the conductor was adamant about not stopping at Payyoli, he approached Payyoli police. A police personnel accompanied Azeez to Payyoli town and tried to stop the bus, but it sped away. Another policeman on duty at Moorad bridge was asked to stop the vehicle but the bus hurtled past him as well.   police missed the bus by the time they swung into action. Chombala police finally stopped the bus at Kunhippalli at 3.05am by parking a police jeep in the middle of the road.
 
 "My daughter had pleaded with the conductor and driver. Fellow travellers didn't support her,"Azeez said.The girl has filed a complaint at Chombala station against driver Noushad and conductor Ajeshkumar .SI P K Jithesh said that he has summoned the duo and has sent a letter to KSRTC . The police is yet to register a case. Top KSRTC officials said that an order was issued stating the Minnal service should be considered as a special service and there won't be any stops other than the designated stops even during night.
