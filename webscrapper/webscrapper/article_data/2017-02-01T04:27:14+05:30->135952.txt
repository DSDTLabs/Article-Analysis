NEW DELHI: A 25-year-old man was shot   by three assailants in outer Delhi’s   near Sultanpuri late on Monday while he was entering his house. The victim, Sidharth Sharma, is battling for life at a local hospital. He is an eyewitness in a woman’s   that took place in Mangolpuri’s Y-Block in March 2016.

 The victim’s family claimed that he was being pressured to withdraw his statement. However, even after receiving the threats, he went to a court in Rohini on Monday morning.

 Sharma’s family said that they had informed the police about the repeated threats over the past one month, but no action was taken to ensure his security. Sources said the DCP may be quizzed as to why Sharma wasn’t given protection. CCTV footages are being scanned and locals are being questioning to identify the shooters.
