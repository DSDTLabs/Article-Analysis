HYDERABAD: Beer is all set to receive some royal treatment in the state, thanks to the ongoing strike by transporters. If the   is not called off in the next couple of days, the excise department will seek police escort for transporting beer from the breweries to the   depots in various districts, including the city. 

 Alternate plans to keep the liquor flowing from the breweries and distilleries to the depots were discussed at a meeting at the Secretariat here on Thursday. The meeting was attended by representatives of 17 breweries and 6 distilleries in the state. The government was informed that the companies supplied stocks enough to meet the demand for 15 days - but this was before the transportation strike began a week ago. 
 
 With stocks dwindling each day, especially of beer at the  , the excise department has decided to seek liquor transportation in the brewery-owned vehicles. If this effort is met with resistance from the striking transporters, then the department will seek police protection for safe transport of liquor to the depots," excise commissioner   told TOI. 
 
 "The liquor manufacturing companies own 200 vehicles and we have asked them to press these into service. We also plan to seek government permission to transport liquor in three-wheeler trollies if the need arises," he said. Telangana consumed 335 lakh cases of beer last year and summer season accounts for nearly a third of this demand. Each case comprises 12 bottles.
