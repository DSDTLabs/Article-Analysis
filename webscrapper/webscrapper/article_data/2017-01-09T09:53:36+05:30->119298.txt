NAGPUR: A private bank’s allegedly uncooperative stance in providing CCTV footage to the   has resulted in delay in investigation of a case in which a senior citizen was tricked. Since May 2016, say investigators,   officials have been citing various excuses to cops who have demanded CCTV footage of an ATM at Tawakkal Layout under Wadi police station. It is from this ATM that two unidentified tricksters had fraudulently withdrawn Rs 39,700 with the help of a card belonging to 70-year-old Ramrao Karadbhajne.

 After investigations, the police registered an offence of   against the tricksters on Saturday.
 
 Karadbhajne, a resident of Thakre layout Dabha, had gone to an ATM of a nationalized bank near Bharat Petrol Pump at Wadi to withdraw Rs 10,000 but failed to do so. Meanwhile, the tricksters entered the ATM and offered to help to Karadbhajne, a retired employee of Health department, who too handed over his debit card to them. Using sleight of hand, the tricksters pocketed Karadbhajne’s card and handed him a dummy card, said police. The tricksters and Karadbhajne then left the ATM, that did not have CCTV cameras installed.
 
 The same day, Karadbhajne received a text message that Rs 39,700 had been withdrawn from his account. Police said the tricksters also used the card for other transactions for an unspecified amount. Karadbhajne approached the police and submitted a written complaint.
 
 Police came to know that the fraudulent withdrawal had taken place from a private bank’s ATM at Tawakkal Layout. The police then contacted the bank and asked for CCTV footage from the ATM.
 
 “We sent letters to the bank officials several times but they are dilly dallying,” said PSI HR Ingole.
