KOCHI: With the successful completion of the second phase trials of 'e-samudra' off   on Monday, the district administration is set to formally launch the project by the end of this month. 

 E-samudra is a joint initiative of the fisheries and telecom department. The mobile app, developed by Neonics software solutions for fishermen, will work in the waters even when the telecom network goes out of range. It will help fisherfolk keep in touch with authorities when they venture out into the sea.
 
 The app helps fisherfolk in knowing the location, weather, fish wealth and also about the exact location of the fishing boat which is out in the sea.
 
 The second phase trials were held 13.5 nautical miles off Kochi coast in the presence of district collector  ,   and fisheries deputy director S Mahesh.
 
 The fishermen community was also represented and they monitored the trials on the marine enforcement directorate's patrol boat.
 
 The app will give the fishing boat its GPS position in the outer sea so that they know where they are -- in the territorial waters or international seas.
 
 The collector said that around 50 fishermen would be given training and the app would be fixed on their boats. Based on their feedback, the app will be launched by the month-end.
 
 E-samudra can work almost 35 nautical miles from the coastline. Using digital imaging, it will give information of the boat using point-to-point navigation.
