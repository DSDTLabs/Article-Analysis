THRISSUR: The light music event, which was held on the second day of the Kalolsavam, did not see the usual rush one associates with the competition. The event, which was the stepping stone for popular singers such as Chitra and  , was relegated to a small classroom this year instead of a large stage.

 The improvised manual confused this year’s participants as they were allowed to bring a shruti box, which would aid their performance. “We were a bit astonished to see a contestant using the shruti box for the performance. It is alright because my daughter prepared her performance without using it. But, it might help me next time,” said   P, mother of a contestant who took part in the light music event in the high school category.
 
  from  , whose daughter was one among the few who used a shruti box at the event, said that main advantage of using this device was that it allowed the judges to know whether the singer was ‘in tune’.
 
 Meanwhile, renowned Carnatic singer and lyricist   said the introduction of shruti box will not help improve. “The paradigms of a light singing event is often confused with that of Carnatic singing by judges and contestants. To end that confusion, Kalolsavam authorities should have allowed the participants to have a sort of ‘backing beats’ on stage, maybe a tabla player. That would have been more useful” he added.
