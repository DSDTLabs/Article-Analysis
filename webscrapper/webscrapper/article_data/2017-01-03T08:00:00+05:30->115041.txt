JAIPUR: Former chief minister   on Monday asked the   government to tell the nation the outcome of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision on demonetisation. In a series of tweets, Gehlot said it was undemocratic to keep facts hidden from people about a move that brought “economic turmoil” in the country.

 Gehlot said data must be released for the “policy induced recession” by the PM which caused immense pain to common people. “How many people lost lives across the country? How much black money and fake currency has been unearthed?” Gehlot tweeted. He asked the government to tell how much the whole exercise cost the exchequer. “The PM, NDA ministers and RBI have been silent on these pertinent issues. The RBI has not replied to any of the RTI queries on the same. They fear the answers would expose how big a fiasco the whole operation has been,” he tweeted.
