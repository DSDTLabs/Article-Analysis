In a quick chat with us, the actors shared anecdotes of shooting the film in Delhi, and how romance brew between their   co-stars Richa Chaddha and Ali Fazal.

  
 Varun, who hails from Jalandhar, had come to Delhi to prepare for his role in 'Fukrey' which had released in 2013. He says, "I had come to Delhi before we started filming for Fukrey. I used to go to schools and colleges in Delhi. I would stand outside the gates and observe the kids. What they say, their lingo, slangs, topics, I used to listen to them ardently and would even practice the way they talk. Woh baatein same hi karte thay, but andaaz thoda alag hota tha. The way Chucha speaks is very Jamnapari, East Delhi."
 
 
  
  
 
  
 While Varun had to prepare for his role, for Manjot, it was easy being Lali. He says, "I was born and brought up in Delhi, so I didn't have to prepare much for the role. Delhipan is in my blood. Bachpan se hi fukra tha. Even acting happened by chance. I never wanted to be an actor. It was by chance that I went for an audition in Saket for 'Oye Lucky Lucky Oye', for which I also got a Filmfare Award. After being awarded, I started taking acting seriously."
 
  
 Manjot was beaming with pride to be a guest at the college where he didn't get admission as a student. He shares, "When I completed school, I came to North Delhi for admission. I went to SRCC, Hindu and Hansraj, but didn't get admission in any of these colleges. Now I feel proud that jahan admission nahi hua tha aaj wahan chief guest banaya ja raha hai."
