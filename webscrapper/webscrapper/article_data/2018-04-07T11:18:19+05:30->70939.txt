HYDERABAD: In a move aimed at restoring and developing lakes in the Hyderabad metropolitan region, the irrigation department has decided to take up the development of 19 lakes in the city. The conservation programme will be taken up at a cost of Rs 282 crore under Phase IV of Mission Kakatiya.

 This is in addition to the restoration of lakes taken up by the municipal administration & urban development (MA&UD) department last year.
 
 MA&UD minister   recently announced in the   that the government has taken up the protection and conservation of lakes in   limits. While there are 3,130 lakes within HMDA limits, 185 lakes fall in the   limits.
 
 A GO issued on Friday said works will be carried out after ensuring the history of repairs carried out on the tanks and satisfying that there is no overlap of proposed repairs in any other sanctioned schemes.
 
 Similarly, wherever applicable, the desiltation provisions made in the estimates will be based on the pre-levels and prudent assessment of quantities involved in the consideration of nature of percolation and potential of the yield.
 
 The order said dismantling of existing damaged structures and construction of new weir and sluice shall be done in rare cases after examination of the possibility of repairs by an official at a level not below the rank of superintending engineer.
 
 MA&UD officials said that under Phase I, as many as 40 lakes, including 20 each in GHMC limits and HMDA limits, were taken up for conservation and beautification with ?288 crore being spent on 20 lakes in GHMC alone.
 
 Beautification works on some lakes such as Durgam Cheruvu, Malkam Cheruvu will be taken up by corporates under social responsibility programmes.
