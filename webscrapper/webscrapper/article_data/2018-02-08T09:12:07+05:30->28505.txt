LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh registered a 25% rise in the number of crimes against dalits between 2015 and 2016 - the highest in the country - as against the national average of 5% during the same period, according to a recent National Crime Research Bureau (NCRB) report. The rise, almost five times of the national average, is much higher than between 2014 and 2015 when cases of dalit atrocities rose by only 3% in the state. 

 In fact, UP accounted for over 25% of the total cases of crimes against dalits in the country in 2016 when the   government was in power. NCRB records show that UP alone accounted for over 10,400 out of 40,801 crime incidents against Scheduled Castes.
 
 
  
  
 
 Bihar, then ruled by the   (United) and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RLD) alliance, was second with 14% of cases, followed by BJP-ruled Rajasthan with almost 13% cases.
 
 The NCRB report shows UP accounted for almost 50% of kidnappings and abductions of dalits, and 36% of murders.
 
 Experts attributed the rise to the typical anti-dalit attitude of the then   government. Former IPS officer and dalit ideologue S R Darapuri said antagonism against the dalit community played a big role in the rise in crimes against them.
 
 "Even the postings of administrative officials was designed in a way to hit dalits. There was not a single SHO from the dalit community in Lucknow, what to speak of other districts," Darapuri said.
 
 The report has given   fresh ammunition to consolidate its core dalit vote bank ahead of the 2019   elections. Senior BSP leader and party leader in the legislative council Sunil Kumar Chittor said the Akhilesh government gave protection to criminals who assaulted dalits. "Almost the same thing is happening in the present BJP dispensation," he said.
