 Rupani said, “In the next few days of March, we would introduce three bills in the state assembly. The bills relate to ban on cow slaughter, controlling frequent fee hikes by private schools and scheme to benefit tenants who live on private land for at least 15 years. Cow, Ganga and Gita are symbols of faith for us. We will do whatever is required for their good. Also, education would not be allowed to become a trade in the state.” 
 
 Rupani said those living on private land for the last 15 years would be given ownership of the houses that exist there. He said 850 housing societies exist in Surat alone and they stand to benefit from their proposed bill on tenants.
