BAREILLY: The city will soon get seven more urban primary health centres (PHCs) which will reduce the burden on the district   that witnesses more than 2,000 patients daily at out-patient department (OPD).
 CMO Dr   said, “The city already has 14 urban PHCs and seven new will come up by March at Harunagla, Peer Bahora, Maulanagar, CB Ganj, Izzatnagar, Swaley Nagar and Nadosi under National Urban Health Mission.”
  “As the existing CHCs daily see around 150 patients each, we expect the new ones will help decrease the load on the district hospital. Patients having common ailments can visit PHCs and can go to district hospital in case of serious problems,” said CMO.
  
  Each urban PHC will have a medical officer, a nurse, a pharmacist, a lab technician, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) and support staff. It will also have a bed for the admission of emergency cases.
  
  As the health department has, however, not appointed new doctors, medical officers from the existing PHCs and community health centres (CHCs) will be transferred to the new PHCs that will have only OPD.
  
  “Although OPDs at urban PHCs run from 8 am to 4 pm, 10 of them have extra doctors for giving services from 4 pm to 10 pm, we will transfer those doctors as well,” added CMO.
