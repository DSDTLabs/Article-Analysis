PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic body has received a copy of the government resolution (GR) according to which penalty tax arrears on under-600 sq ft properties will be completely waived off, whereas the penalty will be halved in case of properties spread across 601 sq ft to 1,000 sq ft.

 Essentially, penalty tax arrears on up to 35,000 illegal constructions in   are expected to be waived off thanks to the GR. However, there will be no concession in penalty payment for unauthorised constructions over an area more than 1,000 sq ft. 
 
 During the recent election campaign in Pimpri Chinchwad, chief minister   had announced that concessions would be put in place. The state had issued the GR in January but   received a copy only on Wednesday. 
 
 Speaking with TOI, joint commissioner and chief of PCMC’s property tax department   said, “We have received a copy of the GR. We will now collect data from our property tax payment software about the number of unauthorized constructions wherein the penalty is to be waived off or halved as well as the total amount involved.”
 
 “There are a total of around 70,000 unauthorised constructions in the city that owe the penalty to the civic body. We expect that the entire penalty will have to be waived off in case of around 32,000 unauthorised constructions. There are around 20,000 unauthorised constructions that will have to pay 50 per cent of the penalty,” Gawde explained.
 
 The penalty amount has been charged on 70,000 unauthorised constructions since 2012-13 yet many have not paid the penalty since 2015. As a result, the arrears are expected to be around Rs100 crore. “We will still require the general body’s approval to waive off the penalty amount,” Gawde stated.
