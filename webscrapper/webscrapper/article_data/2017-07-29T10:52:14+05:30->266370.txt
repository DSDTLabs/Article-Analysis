LUCKNOW: Three   and two medical personnel have been   in the past few days in the city, presenting a picture of concern where medical professionals have been putting themselves at risk. This, the fraternity says, is because adequate precautions while treating patients and being in the hospital environment are not taken by the medical professionals themselves. 

 “Some doctors keep a spare stool between the patient and themselves so that distance is maintained which is important to save themselves from catching infection. This should be followed by all. They should also wash their hands or sanitize them after every patient they attend to,” said Dr SK Rawat, additional chief medical officer (ACMO). 
 
 Prof Kauser Usman of King George’s Medical University’s general medicine department said, “It is important for all of us to wear masks. We see a number of patients in a day but are only cautious while attending to   positive patients. What about those who might have caught the infection but the symptoms are yet to show?Doctors need to take extra precaution.”
