PATNA: Lakhs of people gathered at Gandhi Maidan to participate in ‘Ravan Vadh’ programme on the occasion of Dussehra on Saturday.

 Amid chants of Jai Shri Ram, a man acting as Lord Ram burnt a 70-feet tall Ravana effigy along with those of Kumbhakaran and Meghnad to mark the victory of good over evil.
 
 Chief minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi took aim with bows arrows at the effigy of Ravana as a symbolic gesture to mark Dussehra festivities. State health minister Mangal Pandey and Bihar assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary were also present on the occasion. 
 
 A tableau carrying the characters of Ram and Lakshman made a round of Gandhi Maidan and the assembly Speaker performed the aarti. The man playing the role of Ram then burnt the replica of Lanka followed by the three effigies. After fireworks, all the gates of Gandhi Maidan were opened for the public to move out smoothly. 
 
 Sri Dussehra Committee president Kamal Nopani said the crowd was beyond expectation. “After 2014 stampede in which 32 people had lost their lives, the turnout of visitors at Gandhi Maidan on Dussehra was largest this year,” Nopani added. He thanked the administration for making the event a success.
 
 Tight security arrangements were made by the district administration to avoid any untoward incident during the programme. The visitors were frisked before being allowed to enter the sprawling Maidan.
 
 Apart from Ravan Vadh programme, Durga Prastuti by a group of 12 transgenders was another attraction this year.
