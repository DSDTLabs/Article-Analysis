Ahmedabad: ‘Sexuality education’ may help a child deal with sensitive questions and eventually create an accepting society. This was the message of Harish Iyer, an activist of the LGBTQIA (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer Intersex & Asexual) community. Iyer was speaking at a session of the Red Bricks Summit at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, (IIM-A). He touched on various aspects of LGBTQIA rights in India.

 Talking about the role of the state when teenagers and adults come out, Iyer said, “While sex education is important and is being included in curricula, sexuality education is equally important. It will help people accept themselves the way they are.” At the same time, he said, when interacting with kids and teenagers, it is important to tell them they are not being judged.
 
 In the wake of a recent Supreme Court judgment on the right to privacy, Iyer emphasized the need for legalizing sex in a way that the 2009 Delhi high court ruling did, making it legal when it is a consensual act between adults.
 
 “The voice of those who came out in 2009 will grow louder and with the special mention of section 377 in the SC judgement on the right to privacy, we hope to get our rights through the curative petition,” Iyer said. He also spoke of certain myths that surround homosexuality. “I was sexually abused in my childhood and it took me 11 years to gather the courage to say no and to be liberated from the torture,” he said. “However, I am not gay because I was abused. It took me time to accept that and I am at peace with it.”
