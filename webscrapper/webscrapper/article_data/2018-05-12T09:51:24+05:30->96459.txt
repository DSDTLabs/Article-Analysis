CHANDIGARH: Resident welfare association (RWA) of   is chalking out the plans how to sensitise the residents on the   segregation at their homes. In several meetings, the   of the sector proposed various initiatives which they will take to sensitise the residents about segregation.

 The association in a recent meeting discussed that the need for segregating dry and wet garbage at source is an essential practice as it helps the authorities in efficient management of garbage. Even though MC is making residents aware about it, the general public have to take some initiatives themselves.
 
 Members suggested that the primary responsibility of each household is to segregate the garbage before giving it to the garbage collector. It is not a lengthy process to do. They proposed that the residents who will not do so would be issued challans. Also, the door to door collector will not accept the non-segregated kitchen waste. 
 
 It was also pointed out that the residents are disposing of their garbage in open areas which is against the norms of the   (MC). They requested the residents to avail the door to door garbage collection service to avoid the hefty fine of Rs 5,000, which the authorities can impose on them in case they are found doing so.
