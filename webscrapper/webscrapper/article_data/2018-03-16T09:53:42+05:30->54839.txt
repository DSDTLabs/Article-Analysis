NASHIK: Birthday of Lord Rama is celebrated with great pomp and show in   as on the third day after   chariots of Ram and   are carried out in processions from   temple. 

 Both these chariots are being prepared for their annual procession. This year, Ram Navami will be celebrated on March 25.
 
 The traditional Ram chariot carries the ceremonial idol of the deity. This year, the chariot has received new wheels after more than four decades, according to senior trustees of Kalaram Mandir.
 
 Avinash Dixit, a member of the chariot management committee said, "Each new wheel weighs around 500 kg. They were carved in Sangli at the workshop of Rafikbhai Mistry, who represents the fourth generation of wood artists in Maharashtra."
 
 Mistry replaced the wheels on Tuesday and gave final touches to the chariot.
 
 The chariot of Lord Ram was made by Shrimant Madhavrao Peshwa in 1785. The tradition of taking out the chariot procession is being followed since then.
 
 As the wheels were very old, the procession route of the Ram chariot was limited only around the temple, whereas the Garuda chariot used to cover Ganesh Wadi, Godavari ghat, Dahipool and   area. This year, with new wheels, the Ram chariot is also set to take a longer journey.
