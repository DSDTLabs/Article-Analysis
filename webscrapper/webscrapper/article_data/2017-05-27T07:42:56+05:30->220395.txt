CHANDIGARH: Punjab Police’s senior IPS officers have decided to request their   to allow them to give a ceremonial   to 'Supercop’ K P S Gill, who died in Delhi on Friday.

 Gill, known for crushing the   in Punjab in the late eighties and early nineties, will be cremated in Delhi on Saturday. Even though Gill is a 1958-batch IPS officer of Assam-Meghalaya cadre, for five years in early 90s Gill was the celebrated and revered hero of Punjab Police, often a supercop to his colleagues.
 
 A platoon of Punjab Armed Police (PAP) and a senior officer with a decorated hearse van have been kept ready to go to Delhi once all the clearances are granted.
 
 “This is the full guard of honour we want to give to our hero. Generally, the guard has either four or eight cops. Let his last journey be on one of the vehicles of a force which he proudly headed, not once, but twice,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Gill had twice led Punjab Police, first during 1988-90 and then during 1991-95, till he retired.
 
 Gill’s close aide and former CRPF officer A  , who was Gill’s staff officer for more than a decade, is likely to lead the guard of honour. Pandey, who is IG (human rights) in Punjab Police, was already on his way to Delhi to coordinate with the Delhi Police and Gill’s family.
