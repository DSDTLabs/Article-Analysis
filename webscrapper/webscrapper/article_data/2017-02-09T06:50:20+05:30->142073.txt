HYDERABAD:   in the city , who were looking forward to clear traffic challans at Lok Adalats at half the cost, are upset that only two such centres are being set up. Also, the two centres are situated too far apart, they complained.

 Traffic cops have urged citizens with   to appear in a   and pay just half the  .
 
 The mega Lok Adalat is scheduled to be conducted from February 9 to 11. It will be held from 10 am to 5 pm on three days at Dhobi Ghat, located opposite Imperial Gardens in Secunderabad and the Goshamahal police stadium.
 
 Citizens say there should be two more centres in the city to make the distances equitable. “I have some 10 pending challans and I stay in Adibatla. Either of the centres will be 30 to 40 km far for me, so it's certain that I will lose out on the opportunity ,“ said Rameshwar Reddy, a techie. Also for many who alrea dy travel long distances between home and their workplace, it might be difficult to juggle between the two.
 
 “I travel a long 20 km each day to my home in Dilshuknagar and to my college in Kukatpally . Travelling an additional 15 km or so seems difficult,“ said P Krishna, an engineering student who has a long list of pending challans.
 
 “The problem is more for the people in Cyberabad area. There should have been an option nearer for them too. Also the fact that the Lok Adalat will be held on working days will not allow many to avail the facility ,“ added Lekha Reddy , a software analyst.
