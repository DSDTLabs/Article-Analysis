AHMEDABAD: Anti- corruption bureau on Monday evening nabbed a  ,  , for asking and accepting a bribe of Rs5 lakh from a trader, also hailing from Petlad.

 ACB officials said the complainant had set up a machinery unit in Petlad and according to the norms he has to start paying the tax after the break-even point is achieved.
 
 Dalshaniya, a resident of Vastral, told the trader that his unit has achieved the break-even and he should start paying tax. “However, complainant did not accept Dalshaniya’s assertion and claimed that his unit has still not achieved break-even. This dispute between the two continued for quite a long time,” said a senior ACB official.
 
 ACB sources said about a month back, a settlement of paying Rs 5 lakh was reached between the complainant and Dalshaniya. “Dalshaniya had initially demanded Rs10 lakh,” said a top ACB official.
 
 However the complainant informed the ACB. “Dalshaniya kept on changing dates and places where he was to receive the bribe amount,” said an ACB source.
 
 “In the end, a tea stall on Ramol Ring Road was fixed as a meeting point. Dalshaniya came on his bike and sat in the complainant’s car. He also sipped a cup of tea in the car and accepted the bribe money. Just as we got the signal from the complainant we raided the car and nabbed Dalshaniya red handed with bribe money” added an ACB source.
 
 ACB officials said searches at Dalshaniya’s residence and office premises are on.
