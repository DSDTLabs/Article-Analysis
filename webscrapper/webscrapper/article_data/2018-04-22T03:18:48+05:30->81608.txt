MUMBAI: Bombay high court has quashed and set aside the decision of the fee regulatory authority which had fixed uniform fees for all categories of MBBS students in a   medical college over a decade ago.

 A January 2001 government resolution had capped maximum fees in private medical colleges at Rs 15,000 per year for merit seats and Rs 1.25 lakh for management quota seats. But, the Mumbai-based Shikshan   for 2003-’04, 2004-’05 and 2005-’06 determined uniform fees for all students of Nashik District Maratha Vidya Prasarak Samaj Medical College.
 
 However, in July 2005, the college issued notices to students admitted in merit category to pay Rs1 lakh extra for each of the three academic years. Several students immediately moved court against the decision. In July itself, HC stayed the notices.
 
 At the final hearing on April 12, advocate  , representing four students, argued before a bench of justices   and   that when they took admission they were under the impression that the tuition fee would be Rs 15,000 as per the GR.
 
 The judges said perusal of the GR reveals fee fixation is done on the basis of the outer limits fixed by the Central government. “We are of the considered view that the approach of the committee in equating two different classes under the same category is erroneous," they said in their order.
 
 The judges also noted that fees were determined in an approximately 1:9 ratio and directing merit category students to pay higher fees cannot be said to be “rational or reasonable.” “Equal treatment to equals and unequal treatment to unequals is a settled principle of law,” they emphasised.
 
 The bench said when the GR itself had a vast difference in the fees, the approach of the committee in treating these two classes similarly and directing them to pay similar fees violated Article 14 (Right to Equality) of the Constitution. The consequential notices also stand quashed and set aside, it concluded.
