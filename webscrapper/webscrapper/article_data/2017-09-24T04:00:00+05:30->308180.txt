Vadodara: City is all set to host the third international Buddhist conference next year which will mark 55 years to the discovery of ashes of Lord Buddha – which till date are in proud possession with M S University’s Department of Archaeology and Ancient History. 

 “We are seeking support from M S University, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation, the state as well as centre government to host the international conference at Vadodara. Response from Gujarat government is very positive,” said Bhante Prashil Ratna. 
 
 In late 1950s, a team of archaeologists from MSU had guessed that a ‘stupa’ and a ‘vihara’ were lying beneath two mounds in Devni Mori, a village in North Gujarat that was going to be submerged in 1957 for construction of a dam. 
 
 After years of hardship, it was on January 14, 1963, that the relic casket containing bodily remains of ‘Dashabala’ (Buddha) was discovered. A line on the inscription on the casket identified the relics within: Dashabala Sharira Nilayaha – This is the abode of the relics of Dashabala.
 
 “We are also urging the state government and the centre to build a large stupa or a temple with relic casket in the middle. There is no point in keeping the bodily remains of Lord Buddha in safe. Pilgrims should be able to view and pray them which in turn will spread positivity in the world,” said professor Leong YuanXin, joint general secretary of WAB from Malaysia.
