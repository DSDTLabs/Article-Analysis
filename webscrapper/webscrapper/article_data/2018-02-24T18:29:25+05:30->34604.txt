Their love for the sounds of the 80s quite successfully describes their name. With the intent of bringing back sounds of the past in a new way, this Delhi-based band met through common friends, and after recording their debut EP as a project, came together as a full-fledged band. Five-year-old now, the band comprises Molie Lollen (vocalist, guitarist), Liem Ngadong (bassist),   (synths, samples),   (drummer) and   (lead guitarist).
Originally from Arunachal Pradesh, they believe their roots are their biggest USP. Says Kabir, “We don’t see many bands from that part of the country pursuing music full-time. However, over the years, newer venues and more organisers are looking out for artists from the region, which is encouraging many to take up music as a profession.”
 
 Speaking about their career highlights, Molie says, “There have been many in such a short span of time for us. For starters, we got a chance to represent India at Myanmar in 2016 and last year, we were invited to perform at an international independent music festival in Singapore to represent India once again.”
 Drawing inspiration from post punk favourites like The Cure, The Ramones and The Band of Horses, they have a happy, dancey vibe to their songs. Ask them about that one thing the Indian music scene could really do with, and they say almost in unison, “More originals, less covers and rip-offs!” The members are working on new songs and looking forward to a new EP along with performing at newer venues.
