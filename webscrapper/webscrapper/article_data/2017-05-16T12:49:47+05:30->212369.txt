THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With   cases on the rise, the city is experiencing   of  . The by standers and relatives are having a horrid time arranging blood for the patients whose platelet count drops sharply owing to dengue. 

 According to P S Baby, who is associated with blood donation campaigns, the vacation in educational institutions and scorching summer heat are the two main reasons for the shortage in blood banks. “Every year during summer, there is shortage in blood banks. The young generation including school/college students are the main contributors of blood. Arts and Science colleges and schools are shut down during these months and students at the engineering colleges will be busy with exams. Also, the scorching summer heat makes public reluctant to travel to hospitals to donate blood,” he said. 
 
 “A dengue affected person will require platelet infusion on two occasions; when the platelet count goes down to 10,000 and when the patient has spontaneous bleeding like bleeding of gums while brushing or profuse bleeding during menstruation. In this case, platelet infusion will be needed when the count goes down to 50,000,” a doctor said. Hospital authorities say that in some cases they might need upto 8 units of blood for one person. 
 
 A blood donation campaigner based out of   is of the opinion that lack of 24-hour support system and poor storage facility contribute to other reasons for the shortage.
 
 “Almost 300-400 units of blood are required to meet the needs in various hospitals in the city in one day. And many hospitals take blood only till afternoon. What we need is more options for collection and distribution of blood in places like Technopark which will be much more effective than individual collection systems. We have already given a proposal to the government for an inhouse 24x7 blood collection bus inside the Technopark which will further increase the blood bank capacity,’’ said a Technopark based campaigner.
