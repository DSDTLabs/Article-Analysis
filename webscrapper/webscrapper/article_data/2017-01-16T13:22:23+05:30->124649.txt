CHENNAI: As another   passed without Jallikattu, DMK working president M K Stalin on Sunday termed the   as "incompetent" for not having pressured the Centre enough to promulgate an ordinance, which was only to escape IT raids. 

 "Whether it is Cauvery or jallikattu, the Centre has not heeded to Tamil Nadu's pleas and the ruling party in the state is not ready to pressure the Centre only to escape from raids by income tax department," accused Stalin. 
 
 "It is not enough to keep writing letters to Centre asking them to promulgate an ordinance. It will not work," said Stalin.
