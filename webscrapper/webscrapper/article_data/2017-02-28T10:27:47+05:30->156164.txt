HYDERABAD: Hawkers appear to be the main cause of   in the   area.

 Having plied their trade for ages in the area, it's not possible for police to evict hawkers overnight.
 
 Hence, regulating them is what traffic police have tried, but with little success. While these hawkers have been specifically told to stick to one side of the road from 2 pm to 4 pm, a quick check shows that they are there practically till late in the night. And on an average every month at le ast 150-200 fines are imposed on these hawkers, but they cough up the fine of Rs 500 and are back again on the road blocking free flow of traffic.
 
 “We have been strict and violators are being fined,“ Mahankali traffic police inspector T Ramaswamy said as he elaborated on other measures taken up by police to ease the traffic pressure in the area.
 
 “In the last couple of years, we have also implemented measures such as restricting movement of auto rickshaws till Rathifile bus station,“ Ramaswamy said, adding that auto drivers have also put a system in place to regulate themselves by forming a queue on either side of the road at the Rathifile bus station.
 
 Cops have also met   (TSRTC) officials to regulate buses in the area to minimise public movement as a lot of passengers have to get down at one bus bay and then walk all the way to another.
 
 To avoid this, police want buses to ply to different spots so that passengers do not have to walk to catch a connecting bus.
