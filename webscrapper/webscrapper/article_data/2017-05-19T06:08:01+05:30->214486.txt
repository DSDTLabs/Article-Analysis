 It is hard to believe that   is no more with the party. An amazing personality, a river conservator, environmentalist, creative thinker and an able administrator, Dave was a creative writer too. 
 
 He was an exceptional strategist. As an  , he dedicated his entire life to the service of the society.
 
 Whatever responsibility he got, Anil Ji fulfilled it. As per the Sangh's plan, he was the campaigner for Bhopal division and I was his Swayamsevak. He would take care of everyone. I remember when I met with an accident, he ensured that I got my operation done by Dr Dholkiya in Mumbai. It would be no exaggeration to say that it was due to his skillful strategy we won the Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha elections in the year 2003, 2008 and 2013." Even during busy hours, as an ardent devotee of Maa Narmadab he would reach the banks of the river. As a pilot, he had successfully performed   on a small plane and toured the villages situated on the river bank in a raft and took Chaupal meetings on river conservation.
 
 He had organised   in every two years at Bandrabhan. I also participated in the prgroammes. When I revealed about the idea of "Namami Devi Narmade" - Seva Yatra he was very happy. On my invitation, he participated in the River, Water and Environment Conservation programme held on May 8 in Bhopal and also attended Narmada Seva Yatra on May 9.
 
 In a short span as environment and forest minister, he displayed great skills and administrative dexterity despite his ill health. With his passing away, country has lost an able administrator, river conservator, environmentalist and a dedicated leader
 
 It is more a personal loss to me and I am in a shock but, we cannot control our destiny. 
 
 May the Almighty grant peace to his soul. Thousands of political workers like me pray to give strength to the bereaved family to bear the loss. If possible Anil Ji come back.
