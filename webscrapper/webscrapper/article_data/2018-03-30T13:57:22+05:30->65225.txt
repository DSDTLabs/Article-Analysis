 has had a tough week so far countering arguments and criticism from critics and his colleagues. The ace director was in trouble for his poor response to young director   Naren’s tweet questioning the release of his film ‘Naragasooran’. Gautham Menon was also held accountable for the delay in release of other films ‘Nenjam Marapathillai’ and ‘Dhruva Natchathiram’.

 ‘VTV’ director had posted couple of posts yesterday apologising for his response and for causing the delay in releasing the films. But, ‘Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru’ director Karthick seems like he is no mood to let the issue slip by. In a latest statement to an online website, he has said he would be substantiating his claims with proof in two days time.
 
 Arvind Swami, the lead actor in ‘Naragasooran’ lashed out at Gautham Menon for responding poorly to Karthik’s tweet recently. Rubbishing rumours that   was not co-operating to dub for the film citing pending remuneration, Karthick has said that Arvind Swami was the main reason he could complete the film. He also went on to reveal that Gautham Menon had wanted him to go with a different voice for Arvind Swami’s role because of the confusion, but he had refused to do so.
