RAIPUR: Fifty shops were gutted after a major fire broke out on the premises of famous pilgrim spot of Dongargarh- Maa Bamleshwari Temple located in Rajnandgaon district. 

 According to police personnel, no casualty was reported. Talking to TOI, Rajnandgaon collector   said, "At 7.00 am, the fire broke out at 50 small shops located at the entrance of the temple. The administration will provide a compensation of Rs 20,000 to 49 shops and Rs 15,000 to one shop as per the estimated loss. A member of temple trust has assured to re-construct the shops and iron pipes will be used instead of bamboo sticks." Though the actual cause of the fire is yet to be known, it appears short circuit might have sparked the blaze. Soon after the fire broke out, fire-fighters, police and forest department personnel were pressed into service to carry out the rescue operation,   added.
 
 As the temple is located on the hilltop and surrounded by thick forest, the firefighters faced difficulty in dousing the flames. Hence, the water tankers were pressed into service.
 
  president   said that the fire broke out in the wee hours. These shops belong to the trust and will be constructed again by the trust only. 
 
 There is surplus water and well-equipped firefighting facility on the temple premises, but as the temple is located on hilltop, the fire quickly spread within a span of 20-25 minutes and engulfed 50 shops.
