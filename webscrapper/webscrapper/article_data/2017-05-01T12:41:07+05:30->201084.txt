PATNA: Former deputy CM   on Sunday demanded filing of an FIR by State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) against the company engaged in construction of one of the biggest malls on a two-acre plot of land here that belongs to deputy CM  , son of RJD national president  .
 
  Modi also sought intervention of CM Nitish Kumar so that the FIR could be filed to stop the construction of the mall, as the work has been going on for the last one year without due environmental clearance from SEIAA.
  
  Modi said 7.66 lakh square feet of land was being developed for the construction of the mall without environmental clearance from SEIAA, when the rules of SEIAA warrant that if any land measuring two lakh square feet and above is developed for the construction work, the environment clearance and permission of this body has to be received before the start of the work.
  
  “Clearly, the existing environmental rules of SEIAA had been violated,” Modi said, adding after the matter came to light, RJD MLA from Sursand (Muzaffarpur)  , the builder, moved SEIAA on April 18 seeking its clearance to start the work. Modi said now that work on the land in question has already begun, only the   (NGT) can give the further clearance after penalising the errant builder. The former deputy CM said he has already raised the issue with the SEIAA.
  
  “The influence of environment and forest minister  , son of Lalu and elder brother of Tejashwi, has probably been a hurdle in the SEIAA not filing the FIR against the company,” Modi added.
