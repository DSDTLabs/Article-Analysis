LUCKNOW: It was a trivial argument that led to the murder of the elderly man in   whose body was found in his house on Saturday.

 The deceased,  , was in early 60s and stayed in   alone. Police found that some youths of the locality often visited Sanwal’s house, particularly late in the evening.
 
 Police learnt that one Prateek   had visited Sanwal on Friday. But when a constable went to Prateek’s house, his parents said he had been away for several days, said additional SP (west) Vikas  .
 
 A team nabbed Prateek on Sunday afternoon from   crossing before he could board a bus for Hardoi.
 
 Prateek confessed to killing Sanwal, saying he often had drinks and dinner with Sanwal at his house and had visited him on Friday night too. He revealed that an argument broke out between him and Sanwal after the two had whisky.
 
 “Sanwal told Prateek that he was good for nothing and acts like an impotent man,” said ASP Tripathi.
 
 Prateek flew into a rage, picked up his helmet and battered Sanwal to death. To make sure that Sanwal was dead, Prateek strangled the elderly man with an electric wire later, said the police.
 
 SHO of Kaiserbagh police station DK   said the helmet used had been recovered. “We also recovered Prateek’s blood-soaked shirt and have sent it for forensic examination,” he added.
