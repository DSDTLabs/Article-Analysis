Ludhiana: This Dussehra will be special with Ravana dressed in contemporary clothes. Various Dussehra and Ram Leela committees are gearing up for Dussehra celebrations. President, Ram Leela and Dussehra Committee of Rajguru Nagar Brij Mohan Kalia said the 45 feet tall Ravana effigy in their locality will be dressed in a coat and trousers. He said there will be rides for children in the fair, which started on Thursday. 

 The Ravan effigy in Daresi will tower over all others at 85 feet. The effigies will also have sound effects. Sanjeev Kundra of Shri Ram Leela Committee, Daresi said as usual, effigies of Ravana, Meghnath and Kumbhkaran will be made. However, special attention will be paid to the effigy of Ravan, with moving arms and interesting sound effects. 
 
 Secretary, Nav Dugra Mandir Trust, Sarabha Nagar Anil Bassi said the height of Ravana effigy will be 45 feet and rides for children will be available till Dussehra. He said they expect 25,000 visitors. 
 
 GST shocker 
 
 Dussehra committees organising celebrations on a large scale received a shock as they will have to pay 18 % entertainment tax to the government. Organisers said fresh charges are tantamount to harassment and said many organisers have increased rates of rides at Dussehra fare venues.
 
 Security arrangements 
 
 A few Dussehra committees are installing CCTV cameras and appointing private guards while others are dependent on the city police. At Daresi, CCTV cameras will be installed on Dussehra day. Management of Upkar Nagar Dussehra committee got cameras installed for all days and private bouncers have also been hired.
 
 Rising cost
 
 Artist Asgar Ali, an Agra resident who has been making effigies in Ludhiana since 2004 said for the past few years, the cost of effigies has been increasing and profit reducing. He said they try to be innovative every year but the effigy that used to be prepared in Rs 50,000 now costs over Rs 1 lakh.
