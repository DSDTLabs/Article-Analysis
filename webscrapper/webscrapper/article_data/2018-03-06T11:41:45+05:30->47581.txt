VIJAYAWADA: Class X public examinations to be held from March 15 are going to be purely in comprehensive and continuous evaluation (CCE) pattern this year. After the introduction of CCE in state-affiliated schools three years ago, the board is now set to implement CCE completely for Class X public examinations.

 The CCE was introduced for Class X examinations last year, however, the board has not completely framed the question papers in the new pattern so as to give students and teachers time to adapt to the system, said TVS  , lecturer at   and Training (APSCERT). He said that compared to last year, the framing of questions will be more CCE-oriented.
 
 Ramesh said the questions will be more open-ended and creative. “Questions are framed in such a way that they will have no single answer,” he said. “The purpose of such framing is to discourage students from rote-learning.”
 
 CH Subrahmanian, principal of  , said: “Those who read and understand all concepts in the textbooks will fare well in exams. Those who depend on guides to prepare for the exam will have difficulty in writing the examinations.” 
 
 The board has come up with the framing to break the habit of preparing important questions for the exams. It has limited the question choices in the examinations. In the old format, students had almost 45% of choices in answering the questions. Now, they have choice in only four-mark questions. “With the lack of optional questions, students will have to cover a lot of ground to be able to answer in the examinations,” said M Srinivasa Rao, physics faculty at Advanced Foundation Centre, located at  .
 
 “The best way to prepare is to consider the Class X pre-final exam papers as model papers, and try to read the concepts from the textbooks,” said Ramesh.
