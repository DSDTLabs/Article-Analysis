MUMBAI: The state government want to reward cultivators who have been regularly paying their loan instalments and plans to set aside a sum of Rs 5,250 crore. 

 The   has slashed its development budget to foot the bill for the Rs 34,022 crore loan waiver. 
 
 "We are estimating that at least 35 lakh farmers will be eligible. The criterion is that the farmer should be regularly repaying his loan instalments for the last two years to avail the benefit," said an official. Under the guidelines notified by the state government, farmers who have been repaying their loans for two years from 2015-16 and 2016-17 will be eligible for Rs 15,000 cashback.
 
 The records from the cooperative department show that an estimated 35 lakh farmers have not defaulted on loans. However, the state has set an upper limit of Rs 25,000 for the cashback. Under the eligibility norms, the deadline for loan repayment for 2017 was June 30. But since the final government notification announcing the scheme came out on June 27, farmers have been asking the government to extend the deadline for repayment. "The disbursement of fresh loans for this year was also getting affected due to defaults. Hence the scheme has been announced to encourage repayment," said an official. The government is also likely to extend the deadline for loan repayment by three months to allow farmers to avail cashback.
 
 The loan waiver scheme was announced following a clamour from the opposition and distressed cultivators.
