TUTICORIN: Disruption of internet services in  , Kanyakumari and   districts has made it difficult for people to do transactions and even book tickets to return home as the holidays are ending.

 In Tuticorin, the ATMs of banks which had VSAT connectivity are functioning, but those of some nationalised banks did not function. Call centres in these districts saw a leap in the number of calls on Friday. One which had 120 customer care personnel operating simultaneously usually receives about 22,000 calls a day, but on Friday it was expected to go up to about 34,000, with distraught customers demanding to know why their internet is not working. “Our customer care executives did not have time to breathe attending not less than 200 calls per person, and we decided to serve them food and beverages at their desks to overcome the stress,’’ said the manager of a call centre.
 
 People who wanted to book tickets on online portals were unable to do so as the sites could not be accessed. “We had to call up relatives elsewhere to book the tickets,’’ said K Sureshkumar of Tuticorin.
 
 In Kanyakumari, a person who had to send his confirmation mail to a company which offered him a job had to leave for Thiruvananthapuram at once as this was the last day. Purchasing things was also a problem. “This country asked us to go digital, but then brings all of it to a halt with such retrograde steps by suspending internet services,’’ said a tourist.
