NEW DELHI: Telecom regulator   has expressed serious concern over the problems being faced by customers of embattled and loss-making mobile operator   and has asked the company to furnish details regarding the "unspent balance amount" of pre-paid subscribers, who have ported out of the network. Aircel has a customer base of around 8 crore. 

 Also, in a major relief to the harried subscribers, the regulator has allowed them to port out of the Aircel network even if they are yet to complete the mandated 90-day period with the operator, Trai sources told TOI. 
 
  Trai's concern comes after the company informed the regulator that it is undergoing "deep financial stress" and has shut down operations in six circles - Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh (West), with effect from January 31 this year. 
 
 Trai said Aircel's services have been disrupted in other states too due to the troubles within the debt-laden company, which is understood to be looking at filing for bankruptcy.
 
  Malaysian Maxis-owned company is believed to be carrying a debt of over Rs 15,000 crore and is facing a severe cash-crunch as promoter funding has dried up. It is believed that operators such as Idea and Vodafone may not allow inter-connection to Aircel as the latter has not cleared their dues.
