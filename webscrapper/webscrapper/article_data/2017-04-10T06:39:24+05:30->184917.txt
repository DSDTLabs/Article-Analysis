JAIPUR: Don’t take vitamin D deficiency (VDD) among children for granted. Complicated cases of vitamin D deficiency with severe limb deformities are reaching   Hospital.

 Nowadays, VDD is common among general population due to lack of exposure to sunlight and diet without proper vitamin D nutrition. A 17-year-old girl from   knows more about its consequences. She does not remember the last time she walked.
 
 Sangeeta, who is undergoing treatment at Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital, said on Saturday, “Both my legs have outward curve. I cannot even walk. I don’t know when was the last time I stood on my feet.”
 
 Sangeeta belongs to Nagaur district. Recently, she appeared in class XII exams. After finishing the exams, she immediately contacted doctors in   for her treatment.
 
 Sangeeta has bilateral varus   in both femur and tibia due to nutritional rickets. For past one-and-a-half year, she has been frequently travelling from Nagaur to Jaipur for her treatment. But, she is happy now as the deformity in femur of both legs has already been corrected, deformity in right leg tibia bone has also been corrected. But, still she has deformity in left leg, which will soon be corrected. “I am happy that I will be able to walk on my feet. I am excited. Even today, I walk with support but after correction of my left leg tibia bone, I will walk freely without any support,” said an elated Sangeeta.
 
 Dr D S Meena, SMS   professor (orthopaedics), who is providing her treatment, says that she is suffering from nutritional rickets. “The most common cause of nutritional rickets is vitamin D deficiency. Every week, I operate at least one patient with nutritional rickets for correcting the deformity,” Dr Meena said.
 
 In Sangeeta’s case, she was diagnosed with the disease quite late, which turned her case complicated.
 
 Over the past few years, SMS Hospital has turned into a centre for correcting deformity due to various reasons including trauma and infection.
