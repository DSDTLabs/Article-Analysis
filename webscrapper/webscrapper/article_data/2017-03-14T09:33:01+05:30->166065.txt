HYDERABAD: If past performances are looked into, all is not well with the finances of Telangana. Several key departments, including irrigation, have failed to spend the amount that was allocated to them in the budget. 

 Take for example the irrigation department, which got 26,000 crore in 2016-17. Of that, it could spend only 14,500 crore. A similar situation was reported in the capital expenditure of energy, industry, mineral and infrastructure departments. In 2015-16, the budget estimates presented was for 1.15 lakh crore but the revised estimates showed that the final expenditure was only 97,922.87 crore. The trend continued for 2016-17 also.
 
 The revised estimates of 2016-17 show that the total expenditure was only 1,12,191.07 crore, which is 86.02% of the 1.30 lakh crore budget estimates. "There is a reduction in the grants from the Centre. Because of court cases, sale of lands did not take place. Arrears of commercial taxes could not be recovered because of litigations. The demonetisation of high value currency notes also affected revenue collections. All these matters are beyond the control of the state government" said the finance minister.
