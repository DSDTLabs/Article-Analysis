NAGPUR: On lines of the income tax department, the employees   (EPFO), which caters to private sector workers, too has come up with an amnesty scheme for erring employers. With a target of bringing in one crore fresh workers under the EPFO fold in the country, the Nagpur office aims to add nearly 55,000 employees to its list.

 The Nagpur EPFO office covers 16 districts spread over Vidarbha and parts of Marathwada. Currently, the   office covers 2.75 lakh workers. The scheme was notified on January 3. Declarations for workers, who were entitled for PF coverage after April 2009 but were left out, will be accepted till March 31. 
 
 The scheme was launched considering that despite growth in the number of establishments, PF coverage has not increased proportionately, say sources.
 
 The erring employer has to pay the employer’s share along with interest at 1% per month for the delay. The extra damages, which are also charged by the EPFO, have been reduced to a nominal one rupee per year.
 
 Under EPFO, apart from deducting the contribution from the workers’ salary an equal amount has to be paid by the employer. Around 80% of the employers’ contribution goes toward the pension fund. Under the scheme, payment of employees’ share, which otherwise may have also gone from the employer’s pocket in case of default, has been waived.
 
 There is further relief available to defaulting employers under the Prime Minister  . Launched in 2016, this allows reimbursement of 80% of the employer’s PF contribution by the government in case of first-time employees. In case of garment industry, the entire amount will be reimbursed. Even those declaring under the amnesty scheme can avail the reimbursement facility, said a source.
