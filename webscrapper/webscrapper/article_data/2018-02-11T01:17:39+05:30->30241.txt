GURUGRAM: Brace for   winds and foggy days next week as an active   is likely to spray rain and snow across northern states like Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh.

 Officials said a strong weather system was making its way into the region and would hit the city on Sunday evening, although the peak activity is expected on Monday morning. The showers will bring down temperatures and create foggy conditions, the officials said.
 
 Currently, the slight rise in daytime temperatures has been attributed to the advent of this weather system that will bring some warm air from Rajasthan before releasing rains and snow in the northern states.
 
 “An active western disturbance is likely to affect western Himalayan Region and the plains of northwestern India during February 10 to February 13, with peak activity on February 12. In association with this system, an induced cyclonic circulation is likely to form over southwestern Rajasthan and neighbourhood. Moisture incursion will also take place over the region from the Arabian Sea as well as from the Bay of Bengal,” Indian Meteorological Department said in a statement. “Isolated rains and thunder showers will occur in parts of Haryana, including Gurugram.”
 
 Although Gurugram is considered a part of NCR, the city has often aligned with the weather trend in southern Haryana than other parts of Delhi. Officials said that parts of Delhi and thereabouts will also receive a spell of light to moderate rain and thundershowers on February 12.
 
 An official from Regional Weather Forecasting Centre said, “The rains will occur during the morning. From February 13, the weather will regain the normal course. Minimum   may not be affected that much, but maximum will decline. We are expecting it to come down to 18 degree Celsius.” The maximum temperature on Friday was nearly 22 degrees Celsius in Gurugram. The minimum dropped to 7 degrees.
