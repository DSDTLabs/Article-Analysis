AMARAVATI: Embarrassed by rebellion of the   project oustees, chief minister and TDP supremo   has given a dressing down to his party's senior leaders, including labour minister K Atchannaidu, at the party coordination committee meeting held at his residence in   on Wednesday. 

 He took   and state party president Kala Venkata Rao to task for failing to track the developmental activities in their own district. The CM lost his cool soon after the session began and asked district minister Atchannaidu to explain as to why he could not initiate any measure to provide relief to the oustees. "We have issued a GO granting the relief and rehabilitation package and compensation to the oustees of Vamsadhara in October last. I fail to understand what you all are doing by sitting in the native district," he asked. 
 
 The CM also took social welfare minister Ravela Kishore Babu to task for allowing the dispute with Guntur district ZP chairperson Shaik Johnymoon to blow out of proportions. "It was not an isolated incident. I have been getting frequent complaints against you".
