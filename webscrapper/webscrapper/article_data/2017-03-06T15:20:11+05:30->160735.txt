NEW DELHI: Bharatiya   ( ) legislator Bhawani Singh Rajawat, known for making controversial remarks, on Sunday said that he won't allow Prime Minister  's aircraft to land in   unless an airport for public is built in the area.

 "Let us decide that we will not let aircraft of VIPs land in Kota even if the aircraft of Prime Minister arrives," Rajawat said while speaking at the inauguration ceremony of post office passport seva kendra (POPSK) in Kota.
 
  
  He further said that the leadership should realise that there is no air service in the area.
 
 "The (air) service is meant only for VVIPs as only small aircraft of political leaders can land here."
 
 The legislator also questioned the inauguration of kiosk, saying that what the people will do with passport when no aircraft would land in Kota.
