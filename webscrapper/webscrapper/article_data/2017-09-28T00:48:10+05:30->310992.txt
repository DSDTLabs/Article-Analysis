Madurai: Thiruparankundram MLA A K Bose, who won the seat during the 2016 November byelection held when late chief minister J Jayalalaithaa was in hospital, has claimed that he saw her in hospital.

 Speaking to media persons, he said that after winning the bypoll, he along with two other MLAs Rengasamy who won the bypoll from Thanjavur and Aravakurichi MLA Senthil Balaji, had gone to the hospital, where they had met Jayalalithaa’s personal assistant Poongundran, who told them that the Chief Minister had seen their victory being reported on television and that she had been happy.
 
 He added that Poongundran had told them that ``Amma’’ would come home in five days and that they could see her then, following which V Senthil Balaji and M Rengasamy had left. Bose said he had managed to convince some of the personal guards of Jayalalithaa and go into the hospital and see her through the glass panes of her room from a distance of about 15 kms. ``I saw her from a distance, but she did not see me,’’ he said.
 
 Bose said that he was ready to promise in any temple that he saw   in hospital, the next day after the results of the byelections were announced.
