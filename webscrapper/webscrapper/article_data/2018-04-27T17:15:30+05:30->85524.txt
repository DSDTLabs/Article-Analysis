Prime Minister   is in   for a two-day informal summit with Chinese President   to discuss major bilateral and global matters. Here's what to expect from the visit, which will see the two leaders in a "heart-to-heart" dialogue to build consensus and resolve long-standing issues plaguing India-China relations.

 
 * Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping will seek to repair strained ties at a summit on April 27-28 after the 73-day long Doklam dispute marred relations last year.
 
 
 * The two-day summit in Wuhan city, billed as a "heart-to-heart" informal meeting, will have the two leaders review and chart a new course for India-China relations from a strategic and long-term perspective.
 
 "President Xi and I will exchange views on a range of issues of bilateral and global importance. We will discuss our respective visions and priorities for national development, particularly in the context of current and future international situation," PM Modi said before departing for China last evening.
 
 
 * The Indian Prime Minister has a packed itinerary, which includes a one-on-one meeting with Xi, a tour of one of the best known museums of China, dinner by a picturesque lake side followed by talks with top officials over the course of his stay. 
 
 
 * The two leaders would spend most of time interacting with each other at "relaxed meetings" -- like a 
  ride and walk by the East Lake -- only accompanied by translators with one-on-one conversations focussing on global, regional and bilateral issues.
 
 
 * Modi and Xi will also hold two meetings in the presence of six top officials from their respective countries, though sources insisted it would be incorrect to describe them as formal delegation-level talks.
 
 
 * Modi's visit is being compared to the 1988 visit by then Prime Minister  , who met then China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and reset the bilateral ties strained since the 1962 war.
 
 
 * Prior to the Indian PM's impending visit, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Xi and Modi have "a good working relationship and personal friendship." 
 
  "The two sides agreed that an informal meeting would be a good idea so that the two leaders would make full and in-depth exchanges on major issues of common concern in a suitable atmosphere," Lu said.
 
 
 * With China facing a potential tariff war with the United States, Beijing and New Delhi could find common ground on international trade, Harsh Pant, international relations professor at King's College London, told AFP.
 
 
 * Pant pointed out that a pragmatic reason for Modi to want to mend ties with China may be the Lok Sabha elections next year, as he would be better off with stable relations with the world's second-largest economy.
 
 
 
 * Both countries have recently sought to accommodate each other's concerns. Last month, India issued an unprecedented ban on Tibetans holding a rally with the Dalai Lama in New Delhi to mark the 60th anniversary of a failed uprising against Chinese rule. For its part, India was pleased when China dropped its objections to international efforts to put   on a "grey list" of counties deemed to be making inadequate efforts to tackle terrorist financing.
