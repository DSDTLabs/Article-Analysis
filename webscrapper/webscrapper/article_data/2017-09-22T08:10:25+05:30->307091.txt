KOLKATA:   set the Eden alight with his hat-trick in the second ODI on Thursday. “For the first five overs I struggled to bowl in the right areas. But it happens in the game of cricket. I got hit for three consecutive sixes in the last game (by Maxwell). Here I took three wickets in three deliveries. It's absolutely special,” a delighted Yadav said after the match.

 He said he had consulted Dhoni about how to bowl the hat-trick ball. “I asked Mahi what to bowl and he advised me to bowl whatever I felt best with,” he said, thanking skipper Kohli for giving him “freedom to bowl as per to his plans.”
 
 Eden Gardens, however, is not an unknown venue for Yadav, who is part of the   side in the IPL. Although he was picked up for $66,000 in the 2014 auction, he only got to play for them the first time in the 2016 season when he played three matches. He played regularly in the last IPL, picking up 12 wickets from 12 matches.
 
 Kuldeep had always credited his seniors at his Uttar Pradesh Ranji team and IPL level for his growth. “When I joined Kolkata Knight Riders, there were many quality spinners around, such as Sunil Narine, Piyush Chawla and Shakib Al Hasan. Brad Hogg joined us in the next year. It was a good experience for me,” he had said on the eve of the second ODI.
