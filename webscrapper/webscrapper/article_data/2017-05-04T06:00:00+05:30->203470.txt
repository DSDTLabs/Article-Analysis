The additional SP’s father Dusi Dharma Rao died on the spot, while Kishore and his 14-year-old daughter Manjeera, suffered fractures.

He was operated on Monday and put on life support. However, he succummed to his injuries on Tuesday. Deva Guru was a student of Class VII of Visakha Valley School and a topper in the class. His classmate Nishita Kamalini told TOI, “We used to fight for the top rank in school. But he was very intelligent and scored high in mathematics. We were shocked to hear the news. He was a very active and jovial student.” Deva Guru had recently sought a transfer from this school as his father was sent to Vijayawada.
