AMRITSAR: Intelligence agencies are probing the role of Sikh militants, currently taking shelter in Pakistan, in Tuesday’s intrusion bid that took place eight days after   ideologue Gajinder Singh had reportedly incited criminals and gangsters in the state to fight for the “cause” of Punjab.

 Claims of Punjab Police that notorious gangster Vicky Gounder, who was shot dead in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar district along with his accomplice Prema Lahoria on January 26, had started procuring weapons from Pakistan-based Sikh militants having support of   (ISI), gives credence to the belief of intelligence agencies.
 
 Following the arrest of   Jagtar Singh Johal in a case of targeted killings of Hindu leaders in Punjab, police had also claimed that such acts were carried out by ISI-backed Khalistan elements.
 
 A senior intelligence officer, who didn’t wish to be named, told TOI on Wednesday, “It’s not just by chance that almost a week after provocation of criminals in Punjab by Gajinder on his Facebook account that a major intrusion or arms smuggling attempt was made in   district. We are keenly looking into Sikh and Islamist hardliners’ connection behind the incident.”
 
 On Tuesday, the Border Security Force (BSF) had recovered 3 AK-47 rifles, six magazines and 150 rounds, two pistols, two pistol magazine and 100 rounds and six hand grenades from near the Indo-Pak border in Gurdaspur sector.
 
 On January 28, two days after Gounder and Lahoria were gunned down by Punjab police, Gajinder had uploaded a message on his Facebook page in which he had exhorted the youth of Punjab following footsteps of Gounder to use their fury and rebellious nature to fight for the “cause” of panth and Punjab.
 
 “There is a possibility that arms were sent to India either to avenge Gounder’s killing or equip other criminals and gangsters with more lethal weapons,” sources said.
 
 Amritsar (rural) senior superintendent of police Parampal Singh said police were investigating the incident.
