KOLKATA: In Domkal, Pujali and Raigunj, the first three hours of polling on Sunday witnessed over 50% of total votes polled. The first three hours of polling was also the time when allegations of violence, threats and intimidation peaked.The   polling data also throw up curious patterns which tend to lend weight to the opposition allegations.

 A deeper look into the polling pattern indicates after the election started at 8am, the first hour witnessed moderate polling. The first-hour turnout was only 18.5 %, 19.2 % and 21.2 % at Raigunj, Domkal and Pujali respectively . But the figures available with TOI shows in the next two hours, when there were maximum reports of violence, the polling also spiked. “Polling percentage is calculated in terms of the total votes recorded in the EVMs and not the number of people who had queued up to cast their votes. Incidents of violence deter genuine voters to cast their votes. The votes cast, however, does not reflect this,“ said an SEC official.
 
 Figures show that to make up for the sedate first hour in Pujali, there was spike of 28.4%, taking the polling percentage from 21.2% to 49.6% in two hours. Domkal experienced a spike of 23.7% taking the polling percentage from 19.2% to 42.9%. Domkal was closely followed Raigunj that recorded a spike of 22.5%.The polling percentage in Raigunj was 18.5% at 9am and it rose to 41% in the next two hours. It was also around the same time when election officials cowered in fear and fled polling booths at some places and cops, responding to reports of violence, became targets themselves. The Congress-CPM combine tried to match the Trinamool firepower in Domkal, but at both Raigunj in the north and Pujali in the south, it was an unequal battle.
 
 In the last hours of polling after 5pm, Raigunj even experienced a spike of 13.2%, taking the turnout from 66% to 79.2%. Pujali and Domkal, however, showed a rise of 5.3% and 2.1% respectively . The spike was recorded at a time when opposition parties, including Left,   and   , had “withdrawn“ candidates by 3pm alleging violence, intimidation and rigging.
 
 A psephologist, who has been tracking the state polls for long, remarked: “Usually , people tend to go to the booth early to avoid the heat. But it is unlikely that the people will do so amid reports of widespread violence.“
 
 This is intriguing for the four Hill municipalities -Kalimpong,  , Mirik and Darjeeling -throw up a uniformity in the voting pattern.No incident of violence was reported here.
 
 In the first three hours, Darjeeling recorded the highest of 26.3% polling, that is 43.9% of the total turnout (59.9%). Kurseong recorded 29.4 % polling (40.9 % of the total turnout of 71.8%) and Kalimpong experienced 26.4% (40.5% of the total polling of 65.2%). Mirik had a total polling of 77.3%, and 38% turnout took place by 11am.
