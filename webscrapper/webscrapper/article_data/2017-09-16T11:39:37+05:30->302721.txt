Ludhiana: Duo Did Not Investigate The Case Afresh Despite Instructions, DCP

 Manpreet had committed suicide allegedly after her beau refused to marry her on April 19.
 
 Her brother had told the police, “That day , my sister lo oked depressed. When she did not come out of her room for long, I knocked at her door several times but got no reply .I went to our neighbour's house and jumped on to the terrace outside her room. I broke open the door of her room and found her hanging from the ceiling fan.“
 
 The police had recovered a suicide note from Manpreet's room wherein she said nobody was responsible for her taking the extreme step.
 
 Her parents, however, complained that Manpreet gave up on life after Vicky Chauhan, a resident of  , refused to marry her.
 
 Refusing to cremate the body , the family had blocked CMC Chowk, seeking justice.
 
 During investigation, the police found several videos Manpreet sent to Vicky in which she threatened to commit suicide. Nimbale said, “The initial inquiry seemed shoddy . The woman had threatened to end her life many a time. There were several pictures and videos as proof. There were several factors that had to be looked into. Even as I had instructed the two cops to thoroughly investigate the case afresh, they closed the case file. Therefore, they have been issued a show-cause notice. If their reply is not satisfactory , then departmental inquiry will be marked against the two.“
