JAIPUR: The   quashed the order for the preventive detention of a man for a year passed by the   commissioner on the ground of   under the Rajasthan Prevention of Anti-social Activities Act, 2006.

 The division bench of Chief Justice Navin Sinha and Vijay Kumar Vyas order followed a habeas corpus petition by his wife.
 
 The commissioner of police had declared Ramprakash, a resident under Brahampuri police station, on October 27 last year as a habitual offender and a dangerous person and ordered to detain the person for a period of one year under section(b) and 2(c) of the Rajasthan Anti-Social Activities act 2006.
 
 The detention is based on the grounds that his activities fell within the definition of ‘bootlegger’ under section 2(b) and that he was a ‘dangerous person’ under section 2(c) of the Act. UP Gaur the counsel for the petitioner said the grounds of detention mentioned 24 cases against him of which six of them were under the Excise Act which are still pending in the court. 
 
 The state counsel contended that preventive detention is based on only two grounds. One is bootlegging and the other for being dangerous person. Though he was acquitted in  , the other ground of ‘dangerous person’ is valid.
 
 However, the court said preventive detention is a serious matter as it interferes with the life and liberty of a citizen curtailing it in a manner that prevents him from moving appeal even for a period of one year. It is therefore a draconian power to be exercised for the purpose of maintenance of public order as distinct from simple law and order.
 
 It said “not only the power is draconian but its effect is wide on citizen and his rights resulting in absolute curtailment of liberty, movement and speech, the interpretation necessarily will have to be strict.”
