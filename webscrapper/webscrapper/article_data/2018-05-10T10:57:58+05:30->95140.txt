NEW DELHI:   blazed his way to a 21-ball 62-run knock, setting the base for a mammoth victory for   over Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens on Wednesday and while each of his five shots to the fence and six over over it were terrific, one shot in particular caught the eye of the former Australian captain and   commentator  . 

 
 
 As soon as Kishan dug out a middle and leg full delivery from Kuldeep Yadav and whipped it over mid wicket with a twirl; Clarke couldn’t resist comparing that shot to a certain MS Dhoni’s helicopter shot. 
 
 Clarke said, “Look at that, bit of   there, left-handed MS Dhoni.” 
 
 And it is no coincidence that Kishan, a former India u-19 captain, also plays for Jharkhand, similar to Dhoni and when about that shot, Kishan revealed that he has got a few batting tips from Dhoni. 
 
 “He (Dhoni) is also from Jharkhand and I am learning from him every day,” said 19-year-old. “Whenever we meet he gives me tips. It was just that I was not prepared for the delivery, but still I have practiced that shot in the nets and it came of well.” 
 
 Kishan smashed debutant Prasidh Krishna for three boundaries in an over before smacking four successive sixes off Kuldeep and talking about his ultra-aggressive approach, he said the skipper Rohit Sharma had given him the full freedom to go all out. 
 
 “When I had a chat with Rohit bhai, he asked me to back myself and I waited for the delivery and watched it till the last moment and kept on smacking it. When I hit my first six, rohit bhai said if you get the ball, got for the shot and my thinking was, if the ball was in my area. I am going for it,” said Kishan, who registered the joint-second fastest fifty of  , reaching the milestone in just 17 deliveries.
