GURUGRAM: As temperatures rise, the forest department is gearing up to provide water to wild animals in the Aravalis by digging five new ponds.

 While two ponds have been constructed in Mandawar, three have been built in Ghamroj. “There are a few reports of birds and animals dying or falling sick due to scarcity of water every year, so we have made five new ponds in the Aravalis well before the summer peaks.   and Ghamroj are important areas for wildlife and are often frequented by wild animals like leopard, jackals, blue bulls and civet cats. These artificial water holes also help in reducing the man-animal conflict as wild animals often come to human habitations in search of water during summer,” a senior forest official said.
 
 The department has also prepared a road map to manage regular supply of water in the water holes. “These holes are like very small ponds. They will be filled on a weekly basis with help of water tankers,” he said.
 
 The department is also planning to build a few more water holes with a width of around four to five feet in every 5sq km for the wildlife in the Aravalis. Forest area around Bandhwari, Bhondsi, Gairatpur Bas, and  , to name a few, will be covered under the initiative.
