HYDERABAD: Stating that there is no illegality or infirmity in long incarceration of a man for killing his wife and their toddler-son in 2007, the Hyderabad High Court has upheld the life term handed out by a trial court to a “cruel husband” and dismissed his appeal. A bench of Justices   and N   pronounced this verdict in an appeal by Boya   of   in   district.

 As he could not get children from his first wife, Thimmappa married one Lakshmi in 2001 and was blessed with two sons. While Thimmappa worked as a watchman, his wife was a sweeper in a lodge.
 
 He started doubting her fidelity and beating her in a drunken state. On the night of November 10, 2007, Thimmappa came home and in a fit of rage, poured kerosene and lit her up with a matchbox. A dying Lakshmi tried to save her two sons who were sleeping next to her by pushing them away. While the four-year-old son survived, the younger one died in the hospital. While the toddler died on November 11, Lakshmi died a day later after giving a dying declaration which clinchingly proved the case against her husband.
