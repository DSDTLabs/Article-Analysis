 Nitish then asked the   government to talk to all opposition parties and try for a consensus candidate for the post. “It’s the responsibility of the ruling party at the Centre to contact all opposition parties and try to build a consensus on the presidential candidate,” he said.
 
 “If there is no such effort by the ruling party, the opposition will have no option but to field their joint candidate for the President’s post,” Nitish told reporters.

 itish Kumar reiterated that he wasn’t a “claimant” for the prime minister’s post in the   as he led a “chhoti-moti” (insignificantly small) political party.
 
 “We have a ‘chhoti-moti’ party. That is why I am being targeted. I have been given the mandate for leading the grand alliance government in Bihar. I am not a claimant for the PM’s post in 2019,” Nitish said. Observers felt this was a time-tested way of attracting political attention.
 
 Flanked by deputy CM   of   and education and information technology minister   of the Congress, Nitish also said that he did not possess the “capability to become PM”. 
 
 He said some people began speculating on “my national aspirations” soon after he took over as the JD(U) president.
 
 “Sharad (Yadav)-ji was the JD (U) president for three consecutive terms. As per the party’s constitution, he could not have continued for the fourth term. That is why I became the president. Does it mean I have national aspirations?” Nitish asked.
 
 Asked about the claim of certain JD (U) functionaries that Nitish had the potential of leading a non-BJP formation at the national level, Nitish said he did not nurse such aspirations. 
 
 As for who will be the PM after the 2019 elections, Nitish said, “Any person in whom the the country will see the potential will become the next PM.”
