BENGALURU: Kashinath, 4, was killed after a heavy metal gate at a recently constructed residential building crashed on him, in north Bengaluru on Monday.

 The incident took place around 9am in NTI Layout, in  , off Sahakar Nagar. Police were yet to speak to the bereaved parents.
 
 Police and residents of the area said the new building was occupied, and another building was under construction adjacent to it. Both belonged to the same builder.
 
 A couple working at the under construction building had been posted as caretakers at the occupied building. One of the three children of the couple, who had moved to the city from Kalaburagi district, was among a group of children playing on the sliding gate. The gate jumped off the rails and crashed on to one of the boys, injuring him seriously in the head.
 
 Kashinath’s mother was cleaning the building at the time of the accident. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead.
 
 One of the residents said the gate, which was allegedly poorly fixed, had fallen earlier but the builder had ignored it. “A few days ago, the gate had crashed and damaged a car. We asked him to fix the gate, but he didn’t pay any attention. The child’s death could have been avoided,” said the resident, on condition of anonymity.
 
 Kodigehalli police said the owner of the house was detained for questioning, and an FIR will be registered soon.
