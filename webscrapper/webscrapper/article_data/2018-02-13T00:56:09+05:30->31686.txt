Chennai: A man who posed as an income tax official on Saturday, saying he was searching the T Nagar residence of former chief minister J Jayalalitha’s niece Deepa Jayakumar, has surrendered, placing all the blame for the episode on Deepa’s husband, police said on Monday.  Prabhakaran, who surrendered to the Mambalam police on Sunday night, said Madhavan had hired him to pose as an I-T official. In a three-minute video he released online before he surrendered, Prabhakaran said Madhavan “wanted to extort money” from his wife. “He said Madhavan gave him a fake I-T department ID card and search warrant. The card had ‘Mitesh Kumar’ printed on it,” a police officer said. Prabhakaran said he was an MBA graduate in the restaurant business in Villupuram. He said he met Madhavan four months ago at a canteen he owned in Puducherry. “Madhavan asked me if I was interested in acting in films because I was well built and took a photograph of mine,” he said in the video. “Two weeks ago, he contacted me on WhatsApp, telling me that he would send me a parcel and that I should act as an I-T official,” Prabhakaran said in the video. “He sent me a fake search warrant.” “Only Madhavan wasat home when I went to his house,” he said. “He called Deepa on her cellphone and asked me to threaten her by saying I was an I-T official and I was going to raid the house.” Prabhakaran panicked after seeing their lawyer and the media assembled near the house. He claimed that it was Madhavan who helped him escape from the house, scaling the compound wall. After Prabhakaran’s surrender, police said, Madhavan has remained untraceable.  The officer said Prabhakaran appeared to be tech-savvy. “We suspect the involvement of more people, and we are looking for Madhavan,” he said. After Prabhakaran escaped from the house on Saturday, Madhavan lodged a police complaint. He also circulated photographs of the fake ID card and warrant Prabhakaran had produced.
