It was a sweet homecoming for Hyderabadi potta — and now one of the most sought-after   singers —  , who got the city audience swaying to his melodious voice at a recent show. Hyderabad Times caught up with him for a quick chat. Excerpts:

 
 
 Hyderabad is always, always special. In the hectic schedule that I’ve had, this was one stopover I was looking forward to. What made this sweeter was that the concert coincided with my guru Ramachary’s birthday. I along with his other students went over to his place afterwards to celebrate. 
 
 
 
 I guess my songs Banjara from   and Phir Mohabbat from   are the crowd favourites here. These songs always get everyone singing along.
 
 
 Yes, I think that audience here are getting more open to different types of music. Earlier it was probably just Telugu or the commercial Hindi hits, but now it is different. The audience are enjoying more than that. They are familiar with the not-so-popular songs, indie music and also Western music. 
 
 
 
 I personally love singing melodies and ghazals. So, I’d say that’s my kind of music. But when I perform live, I love singing peppy numbers because they always get the 
 audience grooving. 
 
 
 
 Identify what your strengths are, first. Once you know what you are passionate about and skilled at, give your everything for that. Keep working hard and never give up. And you’ll definitely succeed.
