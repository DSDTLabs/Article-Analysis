Surat: A fire erupted in a godown in the textile market area on Ring Road at 8.30pm on Thursday. Ready-made cloth in huge quantity was gutted in the fire. Fire Brigade personnel were able to extinguish the fire soon before it spread to other shops. 

 Chief fire officer Vasant Parikh said they managed to shift inflammable materials, including stocks of cloth to safety on reaching the 50x20 foot godown which was on fire. The Fire Brigade personnel were able to save some materials in the godown. 
 
 Fire Brigade deployed 10 water tankers, fighters and bourses to control the fire. There were no casualties in the fire which was presumably caused by a short circuit in the godown.
