GUWAHATI: Jamiat Ulema-E-Hind (JUEH) national president   on Friday said his organization will continue to  's treatment of the foreigners' issue on   in the state. Madani was referring to the  's support and decision to provide citizenship to religious minorities from Bangladesh. 

 Speaking at JUEH's unity conclave here, Madani said it is unfortunate that BJP sees the problem of foreigners in the state from a religious angle. "BJP wants to bring in a certain section of foreigners and sees Muslims, even if they are genuine Indian citizens, with suspicion. By allowing foreigners belonging to a certain religion to become citizens, it will pose a threat to the language and culture of Assam. We will continue to oppose this policy of BJP because it is wrong," said Madani. 
 
 Madani said allowing religious minorities from Bangladesh is also against the spirit of Assam Accord, which was accepted by the government, All Assam Students' Union and other stakeholders.
 
 Taking a dig at BJP, Madani charged the saffron party with being anti-Muslim. "This country is ours. We are an integral part of India and we always aspire to live in harmony with majority and minority communities. Secularism has always been our ethos and the Jamiat strongly believes in co-existence of different communities," he said.
