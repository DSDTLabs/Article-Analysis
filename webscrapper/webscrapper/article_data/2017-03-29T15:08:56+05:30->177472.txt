Singer   said she enjoyed growing up in a largely female household and credited her mother   as the 'heart and soul' of their family. 

 The 30-year-old singer said she also learned a lot from her 'super smart and brilliant' father,  . "I grew up in a house with five women. My mother, my sister B (Beyonce), Kelly (Rowland) actually moved in with us when I was five. And my other -- I also consider (her) my sister, but she's actually my first cousin, Angie -- she moved in with us when I was 13. So this household was all women's work. And there was absolutely nothing that couldn't be done between us. My father was super smart and brilliant and instilled many wonderful qualities in us, but my mother was really the heart and soul of the family," Solange said. 
 
  
  
 The singer said, she is a proud black feminist and wants to encourage more females to "fight the fight" for all women. 
 
 "I am a proud black feminist and womanist and I'm extremely proud of the work that's being done. I'm a feminist who wants not only to hear the term intersectionality, but actually feel it, and see the evolution of what intersectional feminism can actually achieve. I want women's rights to be equally honoured, and uplifted, and heard...but I want to see us fighting the fight for all women -- women of color, our LGBTQ sisters, our Muslim sisters," Solange said.
