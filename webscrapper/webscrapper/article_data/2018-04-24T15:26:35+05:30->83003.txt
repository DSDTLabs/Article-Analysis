 “Tobacco usage is also to be blamed for the rise in lung cancer. Its cases have increased from less than 10% to 15% in cities like Patna, Muzaffarpur and Gaya. We fear that it may increase to 20% in the coming years,” Dr Singh said.
 
 Of the 15 patients, who visit Dr Singh’s   per day, nearly four patients suffer from oral cancer and one or two of them have lung cancer. He said, “I have observed a 10% increase in the usage of tobacco after prohibition as people are trying to replace alcohol with tobacco.”
