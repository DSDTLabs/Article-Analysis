PUNE: A 20-year-old student, who was attempting to deboard a moving   in front of her college on Tilak Road, died on Saturday after she was run over by the rear wheel of the vehicle. 

 According to the police, the woman slipped from the footboard and fell.
 
 Senior inspector   of Vishrambaug police station told TOI that the student was pursuing her third year studies in S P college on Tilak road. “The deceased has been identified as   (20), a native of Nilanga in Latur district,” he said.
 
 The accident took place in front of the entrance gate of the SP College. Shevale said that the student decided to alight from the bus, which was slowing down as the sinal at the chowk had turned red. However, before she could alight from the bus, the signal turned green and bus driver accelerated. As a result, she lost her balance and fell.
 
 Sanjay Boine, who hails from her village, told TOI that Poonam belonged to a humble family residing in Nilanga taluka. “She was a bright student. Despite staying in the village, she had scored 90% in her SSC examinations and 92% in the HSC examinations,” Boine said.
 
 Boine added that a group of people from the village, who work in Pune and Mumbai, had raised funds for her education. “She decided to shift to Pune as the city provides a good atmosphere to prepare for competitive examinations,” he said.
 
 However, the police official added the driver did not see her standing on the footboard as the bus was crowded. “We have registered a case of accidental death case,” he said.
