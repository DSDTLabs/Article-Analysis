 The 42-year-old   and Field, 32, were sued by their ex-employee,  , over claims that the actress 'engaged in unwanted and unwelcome sexual conduct and behaviour' towards him.
 
 A spokesperson for   said the case had been dismissed after the ex-employee and his lawyer had requested it be dropped on December 22. The couple previously branded the allegations as 'despicable lies' and said they would be 'trenuously defended'. 
 
 They claimed De Bonfilhs was fired after three months for his "total job abandonment and numerous other instances of wrongful conduct", according to court documents. The celebrity couple married in August 2010 and have two children together, daughter Theodora Rose, four, and son, Charlton Valentine, two.
