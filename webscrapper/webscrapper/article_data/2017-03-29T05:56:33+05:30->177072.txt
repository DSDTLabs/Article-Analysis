AHMEDABAD: India’s largest ceramic cluster in Morbi is getting back on track, if the number of new units coming up in the region is anything to go by. As many as 50 new units have begun production recently, and a similar number of plants are expected to come up over the next couple of quarters.

 Industry players attribute the spurt in new units in   to growing overseas demand for ceramic products. The region had in the recent past seen a huge slump in production and was seen battling with sluggishness in real estate sector, fierce Chinese competition and demonetisation woes.
 
 “Already 50 new units have been operationalized recently. Fifty more are likely to be established soon as land has been allotted for these units,” said  , joint president,  . “These units are mainly for vitrified tiles, overseas demand of which is growing. With exports rising, more units are coming up to tap the demand,” Jetpariya said.
 
 Morbi currently houses around 610 ceramic units that make wall, floor and vitrified tiles. “With newly set up and upcoming units, the number of vitrified tile units will increase to 200 from current 100,” Jetpariya added. Vitrified tiles account for 25% of Morbi’s ceramic exports worth Rs 4,200 crore. “Many had their new units planned a year ago, and improved export prospects prompted them to go into production,” said a ceramic unit owner.There has been a jump in demand for   (GVT) in overseas markets, including Gulf and Latin American countries. Apart from overseas markets, ceramic products from Morbi are also gaining traction domestically with a resurgent real estate sector. Although, the competition from China continues in domestic market, lower gas prices have given local producers a more level playing field, as they have been able to cut production costs.
 
 The new units has helped increase gas consumption by ceramic units in Morbi.
