 The upcoming Kerala Bank would fill the vacuum and play a major role in building up an alternative mechanism to resist the deplorable banking practices, said cooperative minister Kadakampally Surendran.
 
 The recent developments show that the worst fears over the demonetisation and other such unilateral moves by the Union government were increasingly becoming true. “A large chunk of people in our country consider bank accounts as a means to keep their hard-earned money safe. They wish to withdraw only the necessary amount as and when they need it. SBI's move to fleece customers with the support of RBI and other regulatory bodies is deplorable. It would damage the public trust in banks,“ he said.
 
 The minister said Kerala Bank, which would be formed by amalgamating the district cooperative banks and state cooperative banks, would come into being within a timeframe of six months. 
 
 “The merger of SBT with SBI is going to affect the baking needs of the state in a serious way. Kerala Bank is proposed in such a manner that customers would be able to carry out transactions like in any other nationalized bank. There will be all facilities such as ATM and net banking. However, there would be no hidden charges,“ he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, ESAF Small Finance bank ­ which started operations recently, has announced that the customers can carry out any number of ATM transactions through its ATMs and also the ATM machines of other banks. K Paul Thomas, CEO and MD of the bank, has announced that there would be no restrictions for customers to carry out over the counter or ATM transactions.The charges being levied by other banks for using their ATMs would be paid by ESAF.
