Though it has been over eight years since   made her acting debut, the pretty actress says that she's till bombarded with questions that often compare her work with that of her celebrated parents -Kamal Haasan and Sarika. “When you come from a filmi family, the door is open for you to make your entry . But, while it is easy to get an opportunity in films, it also has its share of cons. People expect you act like   or   immediately, which is impossible. All of us learn... and I am sure even they learnt when they started doing films.Sometimes, I feel these expectations are not very realistic,“ says the actress.
