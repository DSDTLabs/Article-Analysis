It was hubby   playing at the M   in Bengaluru but it was   vs   in the stands. Preity, the team owner of Virat's opposing team, bonded with Anushka as the two ladies watched the match and wished luck for their respective teams. 

  
  
 
 However, the high point of the game was when Virat got into the play mode. Wifey Anushka didn’t hesitate to blow air kisses to hubby as he smiled on the field. The viewers in the stadium were also conspicuous of the lady’s presence who was shown on the big screen quite a few times. While the men on field kept the spectators busy, it was no less a sight to watch the ladies who happily posed for the paparazzi. While Preity was looking lovely in a red polka-dotted top, Anushka picked up casual high-waist denims paired with a black top for the day.
