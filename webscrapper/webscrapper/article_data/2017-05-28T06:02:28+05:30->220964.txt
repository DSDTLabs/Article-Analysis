PUNE: The India Meteorological Department ( ) predicted on Saturday that the southwest monsoon could advance into some parts of south  , cover the Maldives-Comorin area and hit south   on May 30-31.

 According to the prediction, monsoon’s advancement over Kerala seemed imminent with the strengthening of westerlies and northward shift of shear zone — typical of monsoon onset. Similar favourable conditions also prevail in Northeast India, and could cover Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura.
 
 “It is expected that the conditions for monsoon onset would be fulfilled towards May 30. The appearance of a shear zone is a typical feature around the time of the  . This zone is likely to appear to the southwest of Kerala and shift further across the state around the time of the onset,” a senior IMD official said.
 
 One of the criteria to declare the monsoon onset over Kerala is based on the data from 14 weather stations — Minicoy, Amini, Thiruvananthapuram, Punalur, Kollam, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kochi, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Thalassery, Kannur, Kudulu and Mangalore. If these weather stations report rainfall of 2.5mm or more for two continuous days from May 10 onwards and if other criteria are also met, then the monsoon onset is declared. The other criteria include specific features in the wind pattern and Outgoing Longwave Radiation to indicate favourable condition for the arrival of monsoon.
 
 On May 27, the southwest monsoon advanced into some parts of Comorin, some more parts of southwest and southeast Bay of Bengal. An IMD forecast issued on the day said conditions were favourable for the further advancement of southwest monsoon into some more parts of southwest and east-central   and the remaining parts of southeast Bay of Bengal in the next three-four days under the influence of a well-marked low pressure area over east-central and adjoining west-central and southeast Bay of Bengal. It is likely to concentrate into a depression during the next 24 hours.
