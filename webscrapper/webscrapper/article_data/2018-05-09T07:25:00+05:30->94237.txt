Panchkula: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday put on record, a letter, which was allegedly written by Dera Sacha Sauda followers to Khatta Singh, former driver of rape convict dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, threatening him with dire consequences if Khatta deposed against him.

 CBI produced the letter as Khatta got his statement recorded before the special CBI court in Panchkula in the murder case of Ranjit Singh, former manager of the dera.
 
 Khatta reached the court in the afternoon under a security cover and testified for an hour-and-a-half. While deposing before the court, Khatta said Ranjit had left the dera’s ‘gufa’ and did not turn up when Gurmeet called for him. As Ranjit did not return, the dera head convened a meeting wherein he ordered Ranjit’s execution, Khatta told the special judge Jagdeep Singh.
 
 According to information, among those who attended the meeting called by the dera head included Krishan Lal, Avtar Singh Jasbir and Sabdil.
 
 It is alleged that before leaving the dera, the management had called Ranjit to meet Gurmeet and tender an apology or face consequences. Ranjit did not budge and left the dera. Consequently, the dera members made another effort to call Ranjit before Gurmeet gave final directions for his elimination, Khatta told the court.
 
 On July 10, 2002, Ranjit was shot by four persons while he was on his way to serve tea to his father in Khanpur Kohlian village of Kurukshetra. He had later succumbed to bullet injuries. Following the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court, the CBI had taken over the case.
 
 In 2008, Khatta had got his statement recorded but had retracted later. Earlier this month, the high court had allowed him to depose in the two cases as witness. On May 6, he had deposed as witness in journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati’s murder case.
