PUNE: Senior Indian scientists have criticised junior HRD minister   for dismissing Charles  's Theory of Evolution. The scientists shot off a letter to the HRD ministry stating that Singh was factually wrong in saying that the scientific community has rejected the evolutionary principle. 

  "On the contrary, every new discovery adds support to Darwin's insights. The statement claiming Vedas had answers to all questions is exaggerated and insult to genuine research work on the history of Indian scientific traditions," the letter said. 
 
 "As a scientist, I am totally shocked," eminent radio astronomer Govind Swarup told TOI. "Over the last 100 years, since Darwin, a great deal of research has been done regarding evolution of life on earth based on solid scientific evidence. The minister's lack of knowledge is shocking." 
 
  Aniket Sule, reader at Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, has started a signature campaign along with other scientists asking the HRD ministry to issue a clarification about its policy towards teaching the theory of evolution. Within 24 hours, the campaign garnered over 1,200 signatures. 
 
  Singh, an IPS officer-turned-politician, had commented on Darwin's theory at a sammelan in Aurangabad. "Our ancestors have nowhere mentioned that they saw an ape turning into a man. Darwin's theory (of evolution of humans) is scientifically wrong. It needs to change in school and college curricula. Ever since man was seen on Earth, he has always been a man," he had said. He did not respond to TOI emails or calls.
