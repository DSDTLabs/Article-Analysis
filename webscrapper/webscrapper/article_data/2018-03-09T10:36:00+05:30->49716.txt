THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state has less than 600   now due to the strict implementation of the   verdict, which mandated environment clearance for mining, said  . Around 2,500 quarries were functioning in the state before December, 2016.

 Replying to a calling attention motion moved by   on the crisis being faced by the construction sector, the minister told the assembly, on Thursday, that the huge decline in granite production and shortage in supply have led to rise in price of construction materials, besides affecting workers in the construction sector.
 
 “However, the government has taken several steps to solve the crisis like authorizing district-level environment impact assessment committees headed by the district collectors to give environment clearance for quarries with an area less than five hectres,” he said. The quarries with an area less than one hectre need to submit only a simplified mining plan, and the government has ordered to prepare the guidelines, the minister said.
 
 The required distance from reservoirs, tanks, canals, rivers, places of worship, crematoriums and village roads for quarries have been reinstated to 50 metres from 100 metres, while that from national parks and wildlife sanctuaries has been fixed at one kilometre, Moideen said.
 
 The government, he said, has issued guidelines for preparing simplified mining plan for laterite (building) stone mining to a maximum depth of six metres. For mining of clay, no objection certificate from the district collector is not required anymore.
 
 The minister also said that the government was planning to double the production at state-owned  , which now holds eight percent of the market share in the sale of cement in the state. “The government has already held several meetings and taken various other measures to ensure the availability of construction materials and to solve the crisis being faced by the sector,” he reiterated.
