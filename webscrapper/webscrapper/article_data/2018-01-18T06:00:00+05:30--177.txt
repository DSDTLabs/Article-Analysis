As   and  's munchkin, Myra turned one on Tuesday, she celebrated reaching the milestone with her parents and a bunch of prominent Hyderabadis at an outdoor   at  . The li'l one looked cute as a button in her dainty, tiny peach frock, as the guests blessed her after she blew the candles out and cut the huge princess cake. The venue, all decked up in pink and white, had a dream like ambience, while the live band flown in from Kolkata kept things lively with Bollywood and Sufi tunes. Dressed in their stylish best, the guests bonded over the lavish spread of Nawabi delicacies.
