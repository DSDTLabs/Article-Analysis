BHUBANESWAR: President   on Sunday released coins in denominations of Rs 10 and Rs 1,000 commemorating  's   observed in July 2015. He unveiled the coins at the   of   in Puri. 

 The coins had been slated for release during the mega festival, celebrated once every 12 to 19 years, but the Union finance ministry had rejected a design sent by the state government as it featured the deities' feet. The Centre had then said this was in opposition to the limbless idols worshipped in Puri. The state government had distanced itself from the row, saying the expert panel that sent the design had been selected by the Centre.
 
 "We are glad that the coins have finally been released. We would have been happier had the President released them during his visit to the Jagannath Temple itself," said a temple official.
