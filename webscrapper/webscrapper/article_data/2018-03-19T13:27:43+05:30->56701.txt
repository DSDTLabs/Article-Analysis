  While Taj Mahal has referred as “Tejo Mahalaya temple”, Madhya Pradesh’s Kamal Maula Mosque has been referred as “Bhojshala” and Kashi’s Gyanvyapi mosque has been called the “Vishwanath temple”. The calendar refers to Qutab Minar as “Vishnu Stambh”, Jaunpur’s Atala mosque as Atla Devi temple and the demolished Babri Masjid in Ayodhya as Ram Janmabhoomi.
  
  
  Hindu Mahasabha’s national secretary Pooja Shakun Pandey said, “We have organised hawans on the auspicious new year of the Hindu calendar and resolved to make this country a Hindu Rashtra.” She said that she hoped that the government will accept their demand to declare India a Hindu nation.
  
  
  She said that foreign invaders had plundered Hindu religious sites and had turned them into mosques by changing their names accordingly. “They should now have to give these back to Hindus. We will change their names to the original names, as mentioned in the new calendar,” she said. 
  
  
  Imam-e-Eidgah Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahali, who is also executive committee member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), said that these claims are baseless. 
  
  
  “These people are unnecessary spoiling the communal atmosphere by making such claims and action should be taken against them for spreading hatred,” he said.
  
  Former Aligarh MLA Zameer Ullah Khan said, “There is no difference between Pakistan’s Hafiz Muhammad Saeed and these people who just want to harm the country.” He said that this is just another attempt to create fissure between the two communities.
