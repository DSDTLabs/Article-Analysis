TIRUPUR: The city police on Thursday   a 23-year-old man for sharing a morphed picture on his   page that demeaned Prime Minister  .

 The accused has been identified as M   of Valayamadevi near Athoor in Salem district. A resident of SV Colony in the city, Prabhakaran is working as a machine operator in a private knitwear unit in Veerapandi.
 
 The district unit of the BJP, which lodged a complaint in the case, alleged that the arrested accused was a supporter of a well-known political party. 
 
 A senior police officer said, “Prabhakaran has shared a half-naked morphed picture of PM Modi on his Facebook page and invited his FB friends to comment on it by posting ‘Oru nalla title sollunga’ (Give a good title for the picture). The picture seemed to have targeted Modi in the Cauvery issue.”
 
 Preliminary investigations revealed that though he did not morph the picture, he had only shared the picture which he had got through some other sources. Still, it was an offence, the officer added.
 
 The action was initiated after BJP Tirupur north unit president R Chinnasamy lodged a complaint. A case was registered under section 67 of the Information technology Act, 2000, and 505 (1) (b) and 153 (A) (1) (a) of IPC.
 
 “Initially, the police could not trace the account holder and sought the help of FB. However, when we conducted inquiry with some of the friends in Prabhakaran’s FB page, we zeroed in on him,” said the police officer.
 
 The police noticed that Prabhakaran has shared many pictures of a leader of a well-known political party on his FB page. When he was questioned about it, he denied any association with the political party. He was remanded in judicial custody till April 18 and lodged at the Coimbatore central jail.
