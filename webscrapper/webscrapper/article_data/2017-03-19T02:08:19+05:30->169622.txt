GURUGRAM: The arrest of inspector Jasmer Singh in connection with the fake arms licence scam, has opened a can of worms. Sources on Saturday said that some senior cops have now come under the scanner for their alleged involvement in the racket that was unearthed last month.

 Inspector Singh — the former in-charge of the arms licence branch, who was suspended for his alleged role in the scam and had since been evading arrest — was arrested by the special investigation team ( ) in   on Friday evening.
 
  He was produced in a city court and taken on four days police remand.
 
 “During preliminary interrogation, Singh has confessed to his involvement in the scam. We will continue his interrogation for the next few days and hope to unmask the other accused in the scam,” said ACP Anil Yadav, head of SIT. The SIT has also served a second notice to Ved Prakash, brother of inspector Singh to join the investigation by March 25.
 
 Investigators said 43-year-old Jasmer Singh had played a major role in the scam and used the police machinery to issue   by collaborating with the main accused, Manish Bhardwaj alais Kala. The SIT had arrested suspended sub-inspector Virender Singh on March 2 for his alleged involvement in the scam.
 
  police had unearthed the scam in February and an FIR was registered against Bhardwaj and his accomplice, Mohan Lal, for allegedly getting fake licences of 15 firearms renewed in the city. Four Gurgaon cops were named in the scam. “Two have been caught. We are conducting raids to nab the other two,” said an officer.
