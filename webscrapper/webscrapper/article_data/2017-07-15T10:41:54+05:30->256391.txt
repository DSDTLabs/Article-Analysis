KANNUR: Amidst the tense situation, the BJP has opened a ‘refugee camp’ for the party workers and their families whose houses were damaged in the attacks in the suburbs of Payyannur. Inaugurating the camp in the compound a senior party worker on Friday, BJP national executive member   said the party was forced to open such a camp when the State government that is supposed to ensure the protection of the life and properties of the people failed to do so. He also said such a camp is being set up for the first time following political violence, and added that the men belonging to the chief minister’s political party unleashed it.

 Equating the atrocities with that of the violence perpetrated by the militants in Kashmir, he said the CPM cadres unleashed similar type of attacks here to force the BJP families flee the place by making life difficult there. Nearly 20 houses of the BJP families have been damaged in the clashes in the locality in the last few days, and the BJP wants to ensure the protection and rehabilitation of all the victims, said the party leadership.
 
 Meanwhile, district collector Mir Muhammed Ali visited the tense areas and promised that steps would be taken to restore peace in the location. The fresh bout of clashes between the CPM and the BJP began in the locality in connection with the martyrdom day of CPM worker C V Dhanaraj and   worker   who were killed within hours last year.
