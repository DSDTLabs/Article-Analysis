Pune: The Kondhwa police on Friday booked two conmen for cheating a 41-year-old advertising professional Ravindra Gupta from Hadapsar as well as his friend to the tune of Rs5.40 lakh on the pretext of exchanging currency notes. The incident occurred at a housing society located off NIBM Road on April 25.

 The fraud came to light after Gupta lodged a case of cheating against the con men.
 
 The police stated that the complainant’s cousin Rakesh introduced him to one Gafur and Ashfaque Ansari (full name and address not known) by saying that his contact would exchange currency notes worth Rs500 and Rs2,000 in lieu of Rs100 and offered 20% commission to him. As per the deal, the con men would get 10% commission..
 
 According to the police, Gupta collected Rs50,000 while his friend Avinash Vaidya collected Rs6.5 lakh and met the con men, who took them to a housing society off NIBM Road on the pretext of exchanging the currency notes with one Shah. After waiting for a considerable time, the suspects handed the commission of Rs1.60 lakhs to Gupta. When it was time for Vaidya to meet Shah, they apparently went missing. 
 
 Kondhwa police’s senior inspector Milind Gaikwad said, “We are working on certain clues and we hope to arrest the con men at the earliest.”
