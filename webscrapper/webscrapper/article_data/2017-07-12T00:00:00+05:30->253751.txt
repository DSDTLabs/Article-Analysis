Kannada actress   has been away from the big screen for close to two years, and is now set to return with director Vishruth Naik’s horror flick,  . 

 “I was on a self-imposed hiatus from the industry as I wanted to focus on my general fitness. I was always rather plump and during the making of one of my films, Ingale Marga, I felt that I looked really huge onscreen. While I do believe that one needs to be comfortable in his/her skin, there is no denying that looks matter in the film industry. Excess weight tends to make you look much older than what you actually are and I did not want that to happen to me, considering that I am still young,” says Roopika.
 
 Over the course of the next year-and-a-half, the actress went on a strict gym-and-diet regimen that helped her knock off 18 kgs. “I am a classical dancer and had launched my  , so the workouts and the school kept me busy during this time. I did not miss being on film sets,” she adds.
 
 Her comeback film, says Roopika, is a horror flick, albeit one with all elements of a commercial potboiler. “I really like the script and Vishruth’s treatment of the subject. The second half, especially, gives me a lot of scope to perform. In fact, I have even done certain sequences without a stunt double. There are several shots during which I was tethered to a rope and pulled back, and during one shot, I lost my balance and nearly hit my face on the crane. I missed it by a whisker. After that Vishruth was particular that we take all precaution before canning any shot,” says the actress.
