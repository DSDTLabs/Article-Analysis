Surat: Hetal Mehta, 51, a chartered engineer, has been selected by Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) as vice-president for the year 2017-18. 

 Mehta was selected as SGCCI vice-president by the 16-member selection committee, amid rumours of impending election among the members in the trade and industry. 
 
 The selection committee headed by SGCCI president B S Agarwal announced Mehtaâ€™s name as the VP for 2017-18 after majority of the votes went in his favour. Mehta faced a tough challenge from Vandana Bhattacharya, the lone woman candidate in the fray. With this, Mehta will assist the new incumbent P M Shah, who is set to take over the reigns of SGCCI president from B S Agarwal in May. 
 
 A certified chartered engineer holding the degree of BE (mechanical), Mehta joined SGCCI in 1998 as life member. He served as member of managing committee of chamber for around 11 years and as special invitee member for two years. tnn
