KOLKATA: The investigation into Indian pacer Md Shami’s wife Hasin Jahan’s   took a new turn as the cricketer’s brother claimed before Kolkata cops on Wednesday that he was not even present at their   home in UP on December 7, 2017, the day the alleged rape took place.

 Haseeb reportedly told the cops that on that day, he was in   and Shami was at their family farmhouse, not at Amroha.
  
  
 Hasin had earlier alleged that she had been raped by Haseeb in Amroha when she visited the family home for a couple of weeks in December.
 
 To check the veracity of the claims and counter-claims, the cops have now decided to check mobile tower location details of all members of Shami’s family. Hasin’s tower location details will also be checked.
 
 Senior officers at Lalbazar hinted that both Shami and Haseeb have denied all allegations against them during their three-and-a-halfhour-long questioning on Wednesday even as they cooperated with the cops.“Letters to telecom service providers will be drafted soon to get the tower location details,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Police sources said both Jahan and her father visited Lalbazar on Thursday.
 
 Incidentally, a Kolkata Police team had visited Moradabad and Amroha when they had gone there to probe the case.
 
 “We are taking the investigation to a logical conclusion. Technical investigations can rarely be fudged. Since the case is of immense importance, we want to take a step forward only when we are sure that we have enough evidence,” said an officer.
 
 Lalbazar though remained tight-lipped on Shami’s answers regarding his stay at Dubai while he was on his way back after the South Africa tour.
