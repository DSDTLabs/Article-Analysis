BATHINDA: Police have registered three cases for carving out   at   village of Moga district without seeking approval from the Greater Ludhiana Development Authority (Glada). Three persons were booked for establishing the colonies having an area of more than 1,000 square metres without the mandatory permission.

 Trio were booked under the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act (PAPRA) 1995, on Monday at Kot Ise Khan police station on May 22. Glada officials had complained to the Moga police leading to registering of multiple cases against unauthorized colonies some time back.
 
 Glada junior engineer (JE)   said, “Some months ago, we had got a tip-off that   had developed a residential colony at Nasirpur Jania without taking any prior approval. Rohit Arora of Shahkot too had carved a colony without the approval. Another unapproved colony was raised by Manav Kumar of Kot Ise Khan. Working on that we had filed complaints with Moga police.”
 
 Kot Ise Khan station house officer (SHO) Jasbir Singh said, “We have registered three cases for violating laws in developing residential colonies after thorough investigations by police officials. No arrest has been made in any of these cases so far.”
