UNNAO: The teen   gang rape survivor studied only till Class VIII and has four siblings including a brother. The survivor's father   (name changed to protect survivor's identity) who died on Monday used to assist his younger brother who has a power cable business in Delhi. 

  Locals of the village say that MLA   and his brothers had very cordial relations with the family of the rape survivor earlier and grew even closer when Sengar became an MLA. 
 
  Villagers told TOI that before becoming MLA, Kuldeep allegedly used to involve Devender and his brother in various illegal activities following which several cases were registered against them. 
 
 Devender's younger brother, who had come from Delhi, told TOI that most cases registered against him were false and had been lodged at the behest of Kuldeep. He also claimed that police had put up final reports in most cases.
