AHMEDABAD: Gujarat chief minister   on Friday felicitated 11 people in Ahmedabad for their multiple   across the state as a part of sixth   being organized by a city-based trust.

 Chief minister Vijay Rupani said the effort to felicitate such social servants by searching for them in society itself is praiseworthy. The spirit of service is itself in veins of Gujaratis and wherever a Gujarati goes in the world they spread the fragrance of their sacraments through social service, he added.
 
 Rupani said divine work can not only be performed with physical things such as money,   but also with physical effort.
