Thirty-five days after he was arrested by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption sleuths, suspended Bharathiar University vice-chancellor A Ganapathi is set to walk out of the jail, after Madras high court granted him conditional bail on Thursday. Ganapathi was arrested on February 3 for accepting a bribe of Rs 30 lakh from T Suresh, an assistant professor-aspirant on probation. Sessions court had rejected his bail bid twice, prompting him to move the high court for remedy. On Thursday, justice AD Jagadish Chandira, before whom the petition came up for hearing, granted Ganapathi conditional bail and directed him to deposit the passport at the trial court. The judge also directed him not to leave Coimbatore without prior permission. He should also appear before the investigating officer twice a day, until further orders, the judge stipulated. According to the prosecution, Ganapathi demanded Rs 30 lakh from Suresh to make appoint him as a permanent employee of the university, as he had completed his probation period of one year. Ganapathiâ€™s colleague Dharmaraj, a professor of Chemistry department, was also arrested for helping him receive the bribe. The beleaguered vice-chancellor was arrested while accepting Rs 1 lakh in cash, and cheques for the remaining Rs 29 lakh.
