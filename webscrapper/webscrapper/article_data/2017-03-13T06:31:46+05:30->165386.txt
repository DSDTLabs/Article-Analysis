KOCHI:  , which has miserably failed in setting up a new solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram, has got a new task. The state government has relieved   of the responsibility of managing the transportation of waste to the septage treatment plant at Brahmapuram, and asked the local body to take over the job. 

 The septage treatment plant at Brahmapuram has the capacity to treat 20 truckloads of waste a day. 
 
 It was   which had been managing the firms which transport septage waste. Now, the state government has asked Clean Kerala to focus on solving the issues of e-waste and plastic waste treatment which are set as the company's main objective.
 
 "As of now, ABG, a private firm, runs the plant. So, we don't have to bother about running the plant. But, we will have to transportation of waste to the plant," one of the officials with Kochi corporation said. 
 
 "There are many firms which are into cleaning of septic tanks. Hundreds of truckloads of septage waste are being removed from households and shops in the city and suburbs. Of this, we will have to select 20 trucks and it is certainly going to be a headache," the official said.
 
 Earlier,   (KSUDP) had pointed out faults in the running of the septage plant. The   officials had reported that the firm running the plant had failed to conduct regular coliform tests. The private firm also had failed to carry out repair works.
 
 Later, responding to the KSUDP's report, the private firm decided to carry out the repair works. For round-the-clock operations, the plant requires 20 truckloads of septage waste. 
 
 Due to protests by local residents against transporting waste during daytime, only 10 truckloads of waste is being taken to the plant daily now. It was in December 2015 that the septage treatment plant was constructed at a cost of Rs 4.7 crore was commissioned.
