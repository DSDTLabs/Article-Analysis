Pune: The proposed helipad at Circuit House for VIP operations continues to wait for clearance from the defence authorities for two-and-a-half years, Pune district collector Saurabh Rao said on Tuesday. 

 The administration continues to await a positive reply despite repeated letters to the Cantonment Board and Southern Command, he told TOI.
 
 The proposed helipad will cater to VIP movement especially of the President, vice-president, Prime Minister, chief ministers and other ministers and help avoid their road movement in the city. 
 
 “The proposal was made keeping in mind the heavy VIP movement in the city. Several letters have been forwarded to the defence officials. The last letter was sent to the defence officials on July 14. We are yet to get any reply from them,” the collector said. 
 
 Last year on July 15, the collector had send a letter to the Southern Command, seeking clearance for the helipad. The reply on November 16 stated that they needed “some clearances” from the defence ministry. 
 
 The collector also said that the work on the Purandar airport project was on track and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) would conduct a study and clear some “technical queries” raised by the Indian Air Force by the first week of August. 
 
 After 17 years, Rao said, the IAF has agreed to some “slight variations” on the runways of the Lohegaon airport and the upcoming Purandar airport.
