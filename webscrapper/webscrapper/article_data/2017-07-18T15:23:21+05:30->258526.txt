NEW DELHI: He wasn’t exactly a selfless redistributor of wealth. But this burglar tried to be like Robin Hood by robbing rich homes and paying a part of his loot on food and medicines for the poor. 

  alias   would break into homes in upscale south Delhi colonies by slithering up walls or pipes. To cover his tracks, he wouldn’t wear shoes. But one day, he was caught on CCTV camera at a  , which led the cops to him. 
 
 “A team led by ACP operations, KP Singh, was formed to track him down after we got a lead about his movements in the area. They started tracking him, but he frequently disguised himself to stay under the radar,” said DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya.
 
 Police finally traced him to a house in Jamia Nagar. When they raided it, the landlord identified Irfan and handed over his Bihar address to the police. A team was sent there and Irfan was arrested. 
 
 During interrogation, Irfan said he passed Class V from a school in his village in Sitamarhi. Search for a job brought him to Delhi four years ago. He started an apparel store in Bawana for a while, but his business tanked, forcing him to burgle houses. 
 
 He would roam around bare-footed in Lajpat Nagar, GK and New Friends Colony, and select a target. He never hired an accomplice. 
 
 After every burglary, Irfan would head to his village to offer food to the poor and organise free health camps for the villagers. Thereafter, he would either come back to Delhi or go to Mumbai and spend the rest of the money at nightclubs where he would party with his girlfriend, a Bhojpuri film actress. Yet he had enough savings to buy a Skoda Superb and a Chevrolet SUV. 
 
 Irfan projected a larger than life image of his, posing as the director of a company he owned. He also created a Facebook profile in which his name was Aryan Khanna, owner of Khanna Industries. He claimed to have committed burglaries in UP and Punjab too. Police are verifying these claims.
