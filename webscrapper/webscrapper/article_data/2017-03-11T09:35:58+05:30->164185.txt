NEW DELHI: The   ( ) has discussed plans to ask its state units to hire good sports psychologists who can help young players handle pressure better and ensure lesser drop-outs from the game.

 With India losing several talented Under-14 and Under-16 level players every year due to family and academics pressures, BCCI also wants to make the hiring of psychologists compulsory at state academies for age-group players. 
 
 “India is losing a lot of talent at the age-group levels, thus the idea of hiring psychologist was discussed during the workshop of director of cricket operations and head coaches of state academies in Bangalore. The stake-holders of the game are all concerned and they want a system in place to tackle this problem. It is common these days to see talented players leaving the game after one or two bad seasons. As you go higher, the talent pool is reduced. This shouldn't happen,” a concerned BCCI official told TOI on Friday, adding that the cricket dropouts should stop at all levels.
 
 There is a dearth of good psychologist and BCCI wants state academies to offer good salaries to those professionals. “It's very difficult to get the top psychologists, so the salaries should be up to Rs 1lakh per month. The states should also hire good trainers for all age-groups, including the Ranji Trophy teams,” the official added.
