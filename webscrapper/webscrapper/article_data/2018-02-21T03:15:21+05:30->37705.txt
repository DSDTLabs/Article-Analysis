MUMBAI: The state government on Tuesday told the Bombay high court that the draft policy for banning plastic and thermocol is yet to be finalized. 

 It was replying to a bench headed by Justice   which heard a petition by the  , challenging the environment department's January 2 order to all civic bodies and authorities to incorporate conditions in licences to   manufacture, distribution, storage or sale of plastic and related items. 
 
 The association's petition said the order is arbitrary and violates the fundamental right to carry on their business. It urged the court to quash and set aside the order and pending hearing to stay it. The government's advocate said objections and suggestions have been invited. To the court's query on the outer limit for finalising it, she replied that it would take a month. The state has to reply before the next hearing.
