CHANDIGARH : The city has topped the National Achievement Survey (NAS) among nine Union Territories first time since the annual testing of   system’s health started in 2012. In 2015, it was fifth in   and mathematics, and fourth in languages. There was no survey in 2016.

 The office of the   secretary released the 2017 results here on Saturday but these had come out on January 15. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and the   (MoHRD) tested more than 30,000 students of Classes III, V and VIII as a representative sample of all the government schools in the UTs. The objective was to study the health of the education system in the government and government-aided schools.
 
 The 8,811 students in the district survey were from 114 sample schools. It is considered the largest-ever national assessment survey in the world. “This is a proud moment for us and a big day for Chandigarh that the city has secured first position among all the UTs. We are really happy,” UT education secretary BL Sharma said. Chandigarh has scored maximum in languages along with mathematics, science and social studies (EVS or environmental studies) but the national average is still being calculated. “Nearly 30-lakh students from the government schools have participated nationally,” Sharma said.

In 2015, it was fifth in the EVS and mathematics and fourth in languages. “The performance of Chandigarh has improved from worst to best. Everyone in the education department worked hard for this spectacular result,” UT education secretary said.
