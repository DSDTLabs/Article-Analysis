LUDHIANA: In probably one of the first arrests in Punjab, after it was converted into an intelligence unit for GST, a team of Ludhiana based zonal office of directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGI) on Tuesday arrested a   based businessman, for fleecing the government of Rs 7 crore central excise duty refund. 

 Vishal Batta, arrested by a team led by Additional Director General Gurusharan Singh, has been lodged at   station and will be produced before the judicial magistrate on Wednesday.
 
 According to sources in the department, Batta allegedly had a fake billing nexus and provided sales bills of non existent firms (which he showed as registered in far-off states like Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh) to local companies by charging hefty commission. His clients would then claim credit of central excise duty shown in the fake purchase bills. 
 
 Sources added that by the time the accused was caught by the department, he had sold companies fake bills to the tune of Rs 100 crores. He came under the radar following a raid on him by the department in April last year. The department had been sending him notices for recovery of the amount and further investigation, but Batta evaded them all. 
 
 Batta was finally arrested on Tuesday, following an early morning raid by the team on his house. DGGI sleuths also took into possession several documents belonging to the accused before brining him to Ludhiana and handing him over to   police. So far, the department has succeeded in establishing the involvement of close to 20 firms in this nexus and is in the process of issuing them show cause notice.
