NAGPUR: The new   will include content from   subject as well to ensure that no student is inconvenienced from the change in policy. 

 "We will share the details soon. We are working on what is called the blueprint for evaluation and it will get finalized soon," said   board chairman  . 
 
 In a statement issued on Friday evening, state board secretary KK Patil said the discontinuation of general maths was due to multiple reasons, including failure of schools to implement it properly. 
 
 Patil said that in some schools, students and parents were not made aware that opting for general maths will hinder future academic growth of the child.
 
  "Students were able to take admission in   stream but barred from choosing maths as a subject. This ended their chances for making it to the engineering stream," wrote Patil. Some schools purposely pushed students to take up general maths to boost their academic performance in SSC, added Patil. 
 
 Falling enrolment for general maths too was a major concern. As it is, the number of students opting for it was hardly 8% on average, but that too fell steadily since 2013. 
 
 State board's Nagpur division secretary Shriram Chavhan said, "The new curriculum for maths will be applicable to Std IX from 2017-18 academic session for SSC in 2018-19."
