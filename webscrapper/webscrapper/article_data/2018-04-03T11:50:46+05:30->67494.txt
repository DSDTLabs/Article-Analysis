TRICHY: Students of KAP Viswanatham Government Medical College (KAPVGMC) attached to the   (MGMGH) in Trichy boycotted classes for one hour and staged a demonstration to protest against the   ( ) Bill. 

 The protest was part of a nationwide token strike by medical students. The Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association (TNGDA) and the Indian Medical Association (IMA) also expressed their solidarity with the protest.
 
 About 750 students of all the five years and postgraduate courses took part in the demonstration. They gathered in front of the office of the dean of the college, raising slogans against the NMC Bill.
 
 They also objected to the proposed exit exam planned for the   students. They condemned the decision of the central government to introduce a bridge course for AYUSH doctors to practice allopathy. The common exam for the final year students of MBBS across the country also did not go down well with the medicos. They cited lot of practical difficulties in the conduct of the common exam.
 
 District secretary of TNGDA, Trichy chapter, Dr A   vehemently opposed the move to constitute NMC in place of Medical Council of India (MCI). “NMC will not be a democratically elected body. It will be against the constitution which mandates election of the members from the same profession. If they claim that MCI is corruption-ridden, they should weed out the corruption, for which NMC will not be a solution,” Dr Satheeshkumar told TOI. 
 
 IMA also echoed the same view against the NMC. “We are opposing NMC. IMA also says no to bridge course, no to exit exam. If they want to promote AYUSH, let them do it. There is no point in allowing them to test their hands in allopathy by conducting a six-month bridge course,” past state president of IMA, Dr M S Ashraf said. 
 
 Meanwhile, house surgeons did not participate in the protest to avoid inconvenience to patients in the hospital.
